960073,5,6305074011,"The best Hong Kong film ever made. What can be more boring than to see another Hollywood movie about relationships such as  _You've got mail!_, _While you were sleeping_, _Something to talk about_. Here, in _Happy  Together_ the outpouring of emotion is subtle, artistic but unpretentious.  The plot is smooth, somehow expected, or generic, universal, yet both the  director and actors handle it in a refreshing and capitavating way with the  great company of cinematography and music. A film about gay couple from  Hong Kong traveling to Argentina to renew their relationship is no easy  task, because the travel motif, and the (gay or any) relationship thing are  not original by any standard. However, Wong Kar-wai manages to put the  pieces together seamlessly. Viewers are also pampered by the use (as well  as the lack) of colors...",928540800,4,838,5.0510948905109485

960216,4,6305074011,"This is a film by Wong Kar Wai (`My Blueberry Nights' and `The Grandmaster') made back in 1997. It has at its heart a very simple plot. Po-Wing and Yiu-Fai have travelled from Hong Kong to holiday in Argentina. Once there, their often volatile relationship takes a nose dive. Yiu-Fai ends up working in Buenos Aries trying to save enough money to get home and trying to forget the past.

Then Po-Wing comes crashing back into his life needing a lot of help after being beaten by his `sugar daddy'. He is taken in and cared for but Yiu-Fai has seemingly moved on emotionally and can not commit further. Things develop and as they do we see a relationship disintegrating - almost in slow motion.

This is an interesting film on many levels. First it is a very honest observation of a relationship (gay or otherwise) in its swan song and of the conflict of emotions that go with it. Also the way it has been filmed adds to the on screen emotion by shifting from monochrome to colour and adds to the feeling of loneliness and isolation that pervade the whole film. It is a film that needs bearing with though and the version I saw did seem a poor quality transfer (VHS to DVD maybe?) that said the quality of the film still managed to shine through.",1422057600,,1245,4.432314410480349

The movie itself is full of nuance of character, you start to look deeper at the characters and wonder more about them, their motivations and ideals. The movie never spells anything out for you, you're meant to take the ride and fill in the gaps on your own. It very much reminds me of Lost in Translation.

As for the plot, someone else said it best:  ""The basic premise is you have two miserable codependent gay men who are stuck in Argentina hating each other.""  There is no plot development.  The former lovers are already on the outs when we meet them, so we have to accept that they once had a loving or at least somewhat nurturing relationship.  All we get to see is the constant bickering at the end of their pairing.  It is slow, slow going all the way, and not always clear what is even going on.

I think the main weakness of the film is in the characterization of the relationship between the two main characters.

960417,5,6305074011,"Some films just understand human emotion better than others.  `Chun Gwong Cha Sit' is one of those films.  It completely destroys me emotionally because it completely understands what it means to be human and in love.

If you've read my reviews then you may know that I have a rocky relationship with director Kar Wai Wong.  My first experience was with the unfortunate `My Blueberry Nights', and following that up with the overrated `Chung Hing Sam Lam' was not a good thing.  I found myself wondering just why this guy was so lauded.  Then, because I was heavily persuaded, I sat down to watch `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' and was so blown away (one of the best films I have ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of films) that I was willing to watch anything this guy has made and ever will make based on the brilliance of that film alone.

So that brings me to `Chun Gwong Cha Sit', a film that is so tragically beautiful (for many of the same reasons that `Fa Yeung Nin Wa' was so tragically beautiful) that I am brought to my knees once again.

Having given this film some time to soak in, I am ready and willing to label it a masterpiece.

The film tells of the rocky relationship between Lai Yiu-Fai and Ho Po-Wing; two gay lovers living in Argentina.  On the films outset we are informed that their relationship is highly unstable.  En route to visit a beautiful waterfall they have a falling out and separate.  This is not uncommon, according to Lai's narration.  They are reunited and, after a serious altercation, Ho winds up injured and in Lai's care.  The two are obviously deeply in love, yet they are both very passionate and incompatible people.  Their fights are aggressive and soon their relationship begins to fray.  This does not detract from the fact that they are, without a doubt, in love.

There are many aspects of this film that are noteworthy and that, after reflection, continue to haunt the viewer.  Ho, for instance, appears to use and abuse the love shown by Lai; almost resenting him for being there for him.  Despite the mistreatment, Lai struggles to contemplate a life without Ho.  Having personally been in a relationship where I was constantly used (and having to deal with a completely self-centered individual) I can sympathize with the feeling of being `stuck'.  If you stay, you continue to be abused but if you leave you will suffer the dark depths of loneliness.  There is also the relationship that spawns between Lai and Chang, a young co-worker who is sowing his oats away from home.  Their relationship, while never truly intimate, becomes a focal point for the discussion of male bonding.

And then there is that lamp, the representation of a life of dreams yet to be fulfilled.

With any character driven drama, the finest asset is always the acting.  Even if the story itself is flawless, the actors still need to sell it.  Leslie Cheung and especially Tony Leung (who delivers one of the best performances of the 90's) are more than up to the task of selling this film.  With deeply detailed and virtually contradictive characters, these two actors feed off one another without ever losing themselves as individuals.  These two men couldn't be more different, yet they compliment one another beautifully.  Cheung understands the arrogance that comes from this character's passion, and Leung subtly shatters us with the pain etched on his very face.  There are so many memorable moments when concerning these two performances, but one in particular comes very early in the film, when the two men are reunited.  Watch for Leung's explosive confrontation to see the full gravity of his performance.

Breathtaking.

In the end I am simply blow away by this tour-de-force film.  Every cavity is impeccably fleshed out to deliver one of the most shockingly real and beautifully moving pieces of cinema.",1273190400,7,3830,4.751515151515152

This splendid film was the tenth movie of the author but the first big successful work of Wong in western countries. The movie is a gripping tale of homosexual love.

960420,4,6305074011,"""Happy Together,""  winner of the 1997 Best Director prize at Cannes, examines a relationship in which two partners seem destined to be together, even when they decide to split up.  Ho and Lai, a gay young couple from Hong Kong, are passionate lovers but continuously snip at each other and bicker.  They relocate to Buenos Aires, hoping to mend their troubled relationship, but ultimately break up.  Ho (Leslie Cheung) hustles for a living.  Lai (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) takes a job as doorman at a seedy tango club.  After Ho is beaten up by a client, Lai nurses him back to health.  Yet even during Ho's recuperation, he is demanding, selfish, and thoughtless.
 The film raises questions as to what constitutes relationships, how fragile they can be, how they are constantly tested, and how even seemingly doomed relationships run deep.  There is also an irony throughout.  Wong is saying that distance, illness, temporary separation, and recriminations aside, some relationships are destined to be.  Bonus extras include three behind-the-scenes featurettes and an interview with Director of Photography Christopher Doyle.

If there's ever been a film made in color where the cinematography does a better job of telling the story, i'd like to know about it. beautiful, sad, tawdry, exciting, and very very moving.

960523,5,6305074011,"I am a new fan of director Wong Kar-Wai movies.  Happy Together is one of my favorites.  When I watched the movie for the first time, I did so with no prior knowledge of the film other than it was a love story between two men.  If you're over 30, you have probably lived this story.  You may have been Ho Po Wing (Leslie Cheung) or you may have been Lai Yiu Fai (Tony Leung), but you have undoubtedly been involved in a romance much like the one portrayed in this movie.

Happy Together has nothing to do with being gay.  It has everything to do with love, loss, regret and emotional growth.  I saw myself in both Po Wing's character and Yiu Fai's character.  In many ways, I felt my life was being shown in this movie.  I have loved men who hurt me and emotionally abused me, but I couldn't say no when asked to ""start again.""  Conversely, I have callously mistreated some very nice guys just because it was so easy to do it.  And, just like Po Wing, I cried with regret when I realized what I had thrown away.

You can read a lot of deep meaning into this movie, but ultimately it is a love story which is all too familiar to the majority of us.  If it is hard to watch, it is because we see ourselves in the characters onscreen.  It shouldn't be because the characters are two men.  Love is love.

Leslie Cheung is both hateful and sympathetic.  He is mesmermizing onscreen.  Tony Leung is, for the most part, very convincing as Po Wing's long-suffering lover, although I did feel Leung was somewhat uncomfortable in some of his scenes.  Still, it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.  My favorite scene in the movie is a flashback of Po Wing and Yiu Fai dancing in the kitchen.  It isn't erotic.  They are simply holding each other and moving to the music.  I felt it conveyed their love for each other more than any other moment in the movie.

Although this movie can be enjoyed on many levels, I choose to view it as a love story that each of us has experienced some time in our life.  It is bittersweet realism.",1191369600,6,2035,4.2643979057591626
960524,1,6305074011,"As a gay Asian man, I always anticipate a gay Asian film that steers away from the cliche subjects of pimps and hustlers and young men involved with older men for purely economic reasons.  It's refreshing that the two lovers in ""Happy Together"" are supposed to be involved with each other for love.  The problem with ""Happy Together"" is that their love is never depicted. For the duration of the film, the viewer is presented with a melange of arguments, fights, and temporary separations that ultimately lead to the final break-up.  What binds this couple when it seems that both men - from beginning to end - loathe each other more so than love?  No doubt ""Happy Together"" is a finely shot film.  However, the lingering question of ""What the hell?"" far outweighs the film's glossiness.

Sure, if you don't like or hate gay people, this is not your movie....I am not homosexual, but the way Wong-Kar Wai shows the relationship between these two guys, is very intimate and i think, it has something for gay and not-gay people.

The sad thing is, there is over one minute missing in the US-DVD! I own the HK-DVD and there you can see a really cool black and white scene with the two fantastic tango-dancers and also a scene, where Tony Leung buys something to drink+eat...whatever. It may sound not so special, but i think it's always bad, when there's something cut. That's why i give this DVD ""only"" 4 stars.

960526,4,6305074011,"Two Chinese lovers drift around Buenos Aires, attempting to come to grips with a relationship that is clearly on the skids in this interesting and frustrating film `Cheun gwong tsa sit' (Happy Together)  by the very talented Kar Wai Wong.  On vacation from Hong Kong, Yiu-Fai (Tony Leung ) and Po-Wing (Leslie Cheung) are presented in an obviously unhappy state, but we are not privy to the cause of their unhappiness.  Yes, there is infidelity, there are outside attractions, and all of the `things' that could create this state, but we are left to look at this sad young couple as a metaphor for the struggles in emotions and loves that so often surface in a dying relationship, not only in the gay relationship we are seeing but in straight  relationships as well.  The universals hold true.

Kar Wai Wong loves the non-linear approach to story telling and in this early film the method of his direction feels a bit too disjointed, too uninvolved in the character development.  Not that the actors do not render fine performances: both Leung and Cheung give brave portrayals of lost souls and we cannot help but care for both of them.  And the remainder of the cast is on target (Chen Chang and Gregory Dayton).

What holds the little hints of greatness that were to come (this film dates back to 1997) is suggested in the lighting and camera work, both of which provide as major a role in the film as the actors and chaotic storyline.  The unity of mood and story is solidly at one in this little film, showing us just how creative the writer director was to become. Grady Harp, August 06",1155168000,2,1592,4.613475177304965
960527,5,6305074011,"Viewing this film was like watching the Tango! Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung were absolutely mesmerizing as lovers who exist in a state of conflict, constantly estranged from their homeland, their loved-ones and each other. The ending was heartrending (no surprise), but I found the interaction between the couple to be pure comedy. The situations that each character found himself in were anything but funny, however, the ups and downs in their relationship were so realistic that I couldn't help but laugh at how insane love can be.

Regardless of race, class, gender, culture, sexual orientation and even geography, this movie will serve as a love letter to anyone who has the misfortune of being truly, madly and deeply in love with the one person on earth who drives them nuts. Those of us fitting this description will find many confirmations (but no comfort) in Yiu-Fai and Po-Wing's story. I could totally relate to Yiu-Fai when he stated that Po-Wing's illness was actually the time when they were the happiest together. Moreover, the story paints a vivid portrait of long-term relationships as swaying perilously between states of codependence, complacency and claustrophobia.

If I had to decide on a letter grade, though, I would have to give the movie an, ""A-"" instead of an, ""A"" because I was hoping that Leslie Cheung would not be confined to the typical ""doomed drama-queen"" role. Ironically, the story explores individual, national and global identity when, throughout the cinema world, one is hard pressed to find performers who rival Tony Leung's depth and Leslie Cheung's range. Despite his hallmark androgyny, I personally believe that Cheung could play Rambo convincingly! The universal nature of the story was also threatened by its stereotypical depiction of gay life (not all gay relationships are violent and not all gay people are promiscuous). I think the film's core message could have been conveyed just as effectively without the use of hackneyed scenarios.  Fortunately, the amazing soundtrack and the breathtaking cinematography more than made up for any flaws.",1154563200,3,2093,5.204747774480712

960530,3,6305074011,"After seeing the recent DVD release of ""2046"", I was curious to take in an earlier film by wunderkind Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai. This visually arresting though rather discombobulated film from 1997 is more modest in scope, as it focuses on the unhealthily co-dependent relationship between two on-again, off-again gay lovers from Hong Kong, who end up broke on a last-chance trip to Argentina. In a volatile yin-yang situation, Ho Po-Wing is the cockier and apparently needier of the two, always in search of the next rush of instant gratification regardless of the source, while Lai Yiu-Fai is the controlling partner either unblinkingly morose or explosively volatile. In terms of where the story starts, their relationship has become nothing but a series of arguments and break-ups.

With no flashback to point to a happier time or a hint of a positive indication as to why they are together, Wong comes up short in inflaming any sparks that could still be struck between lovers who argue constantly. Moreover, the film really has little structure other than to show the difficulties which people have in sustaining a connection. A third person is introduced but in an intentionally vague manner, as Lai gets a new job at a restaurant and meets the effusive Chang, a young Taiwanese trying to earn enough to fund his travels abroad. A romance does not occur but an emotional connection does, which causes Lai to make moves toward liberating himself from his depraved situation.

Except for a somewhat graphic opening scene, the homosexual elements are downplayed in favor of a kinetic energy that leverages Christopher Doyle's creative cinematography. Doyle combines black-and-white sequences with color, as well as the random use of different film stocks, exposures and frame rates to manipulate the passage of time. He also lends stunning overview shots of Iguazu Falls, the movie's metaphorical centerpiece, lending a dream-like, salvation quality to the couple's hoped-for destination. Both the attractive leads lend visceral energy and an emotional authenticity to their roles - Wong's favorite leading man, Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Lai and the late Leslie Cheung as Ho. The passionate, often violent dynamics between the two are convincing. Chen Chang effectively infuses Chang with an idealism that makes Lai's attraction, platonic or not, understandable.

Although I think Wong is a supremely talented director, I was surprised to find out that this film earned him the Best Director prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, flawed as the film is. Although it is as visually audacious as ""2046"", I have to admit I was left a bit cold emotionally by the end product.

960653,4,6305074011,"Just when you thought that you knew everything about Hong Kong cinema or about romantic adventures in film, director Kar Wai Wong steps forward and eliminates all boundaries.  Transforming your typical picture of a straight couple and violently handing us the relationship of Yiu-fai and Po-wing using untraditional cinematography is only scratching the surface of this picture.  If you found yourself shocked by the opening sequence or annoyed by the drastic image of the film, then you definitely are not a film junkie.  This movie had everything a cinephile would desire like strong characters, a non-linear story, and the brazen truth about modern society's relationships.  This was more than just a gay film, but instead a story about emotions and loves, coupled with all the turmoil that surrounds it.  It is ironic that the title of the film is Happy Together, because it completely challenges the true themes.  It is about love, but about the difficulties that surround a dying relationship.  From the visual opening to the amazing use of several different cinematography techniques, Happy Together may not suit everyone, but to this film junkie it opened a new door in Hong Kong cinema.

This film would not have worked if it weren't for the apparent brilliance of director Kar Wai Wong.  While I have been impressed with his other films like In the Mood for Love and his work on the BMW series, The Hire, this film literally blew me out of the water.  To begin, the opening sequence.  If this very sexual opening doesn't set the tone for the rest of the film, I don't know what will.  I was shocked, disturbed, and on-edge the entire time.  I didn't see the love between our two characters at all in the beginning, but that was because it was to show the destruction of their relationship.  Then, Wong did several things that just impressed me and kept my attention focused on the film.  First, he took these two vacationing men from Hong Kong and set them in a foreign city.  So, not only was it uneasy to watch this relationship disintegrate in front of our eyes, but to be lost in a unfamiliar city only made it worse.  Second, he focused the camera on only one of the characters (Yiu-fai) to enhance that sensation about Po-wing's indiscretions.  Through Yiu-fai we felt the human emotions just boil through of having to see a love that only hurt.  Finally, he continually changed the cinematography through different scenes.  This was impressive because it only added more tension to our characters and themes.  Two travelers lost in a foreign country, trying to patch a dying relationship, with a constantly changing cinematic style, was tough to watch ... but that was the theme that Wong wanted to capture.  This is not your typical romantic picture, but instead it showcases the truth about two men that perhaps were not the greatest fit.  Even when he throws in the waterfall element, it only adds to the overall theme.  The waterfall, to me, represented the falling relationship.  Beauty on the outside, a violent tendency as the water falls ... just like our relationship.

Wong successfully created this tension by hiring some of Hong Kong's best actors.  They carried themselves with the greatest of comfort and control.  I felt as if I knew these characters by the end of the film.  I felt as if I had gone through a similar struggle as they did.  These two men challenged the idea of ""normal"" relationships, yet kept their personas simple, human, and intense.  You could not help but feel emotion for these two, even if you did not like the story.  They kept the tones light when they needed to be, then brought you deep within the rabbit hole when the darkness erupted.  The final scenes of this film are fascinating to watch, and I had to see them again.  The downfall of Yiu-fai into a role similar to Po-wing was heartbreaking, yet stunning.  Here we have two men who I thought were complete opposites from the beginning, yet somehow, to quote Wong, ""Turns out that lonely people are all the same.""

Finally, I cannot finish without saying that the cinematography was outstanding in this film.  The use of black and white in the beginning and slowly bringing in the colors was breathtaking.  This film was more than just actors working for a director, but instead a director creating art. Christopher Doyle bulls-eyed the tone of the film and brought forth an intense picture that only complimented Wong's work.  It just impresses me to see a film, like Happy Together, where all the elements come together and work in unison.  It is a rarity in today's Hollywood, but thankfully we have directors like Kar Wai Wong whom embrace it.  From the beginning of the movie until the final scenes, Doyle challenges and brings together some of the most beautiful scenes in cinema, transforming the normal into the extraordinary.

Overall, this was a spectacular film.  After I watched it the first time, I had to see it again, but didn't know if I could.  Its emotional strength was so overwhelming that I had to stop myself.  I couldn't watch these two brilliant actors tear my heart apart again.  It was a sad film, it was an angry film, but most importantly it was a film about being lost in love.  Those who may have enjoyed Lost in Translation, this would be a great film to match with it.  While not structured the same, it does give us that feeling of being apart in a new world, struggling to get home or to discover one's self.  Wong is one of the greatest directors in the world, and I cannot wait to open my soul to his work again.  Brilliant filmmaking, determined and unmatched acting, coupled with the best cinematography this world has ever encountered!  A must for everyone!

960655,5,6305074011,"I saw this movie many years ago(97) at the same time when Tony Leung's girlfriend(Carina Lau) who is my #1 favorite actress also starred in the heavy-duty melodramatic lesbian romance film called Intimates(Self-combed). It was such a treat to see Leung and Lau indulging themselves into two movies that was controversial and a taboo subject. I was very moved by Happy together, but I enjoyed Intimates more, because it was more elaborate and it was absolutely Lau's most powerful performance of her career, way better than Days of Being Wild, I Am Sorry, Infernal Affairs 2. Anyways, let me get back to Happy Together.

Tony and Leslie's characters might have been happy together before, but they had no more happiness in the movie. Perhaps even going to Argentina for exile won't make things back to the way they were. There's a few irreconcilable differences between the two. Tony is hard working, down-to-earth and monogamous. Leslie is lazy, rebelious, and sexually promiscuous. They broke up, and inevitably, Leslie would say:"" Let's start over again."" But Tony has lost his faith in Leslie, and just wants to move on.

Then Leslie became self-destructive and sells his body for a living. It was very emtionally impacting to see Leslie cry his heart out when he realized that Tony is out of his life. Tony drove himself to the waterfall and stared at it while he's thinking about Leslie. It was visually stunning. Tony's co-worker played by Chang Chen was secretly in love with him, but Tony didn't have room in his heart for anyone. He decided to abandon Leslie and return to Hong Kong.

The love scene was pretty convincing. I guessed Leslie must have helped Tony to get into character. Both of them gave ""career best"" performances, but Tony has more screen time.

960656,4,6305074011,"Fans of Chinese director Wong Kar-Wai will be thrilled by this new DVD edition of his classic film Happy Together.

The movie is slow-paced, low-key, and often shot in black in white. It is the story of two gay Chinese men in Buenos Aires, who are more often unhappy together than happy together.  It is not an easy movie to watch perhaps and will not appeal to everyone, but as an art film and a gay-themed love story it is a contemporary classic.

I had an earlier release of this DVD, but purchased this new edition to see the making-of documentary Buenos Aires: Zero Degrees, which is a special feature on the new release.  The documentary itself is a gem as it reveals so many storylines that did not appear in the final film. It is fascinating to see the directions the film might have taken and how such a different film could have come out of the editing room.  We can really appreciate Wong Kar-Wai's process, working without a script, and see the difficulties it causes for the actors.  Lead actor Tony Leung's comments about working on the film are especially insightful.

Wong Kar-Wai's In the mood for love is the film that brought him the greatest international recognition perhaps, but Happy Together was an important step on the road to that masterpiece.  Few new fans will be won by this DVD, but for those who already appreciate Wong Kar-Wai's work this DVD is a must-have.",1100304000,13,1391,4.603238866396761
960657,5,6305074011,"Believe it or not, after swearing off Wong's film because of In the Mood for Love, this film brought me back into his fold. First of all, I do realise a bit of the significance and nuances of a gay life and gay relatinship may have been lost on me. There was no explantion of the significance of things, it just assumes you know the sub-culture in which the main characters live. So for a non-participant of such a sub-culture or psyche, it was intriguing for me to pick up the clues and hints of the greater sub-culture backdrop and particular psyche in which everything unfolds. I definitely have a better understanding and appreciation although definitely not a complete one. I was irritated with the characters initially but once understanding creeps in, empathy dawns. It will only be complex to those who do not understand, intriguing to those who gets a whiff of understanding and I am sure, beautiful for those whose stories are actually being told.",1098835200,6,957,4.736526946107785
960658,4,6305074011,"This film is about two Chinese men (from Hong Kong) who are codependant on each other, in their dysfuctional relationship, on a road trip to see a certain waterfall in Argentina. Their car breaks down and are forced to reside and work in the city.

The one man (more stable) seeks employment as the other just drifts from one disaster to another; getting beat up and depending on the other characther for support; until he (the more stable man) just gets fed up and seeks friendship in another chinese man from the place of his employment who is about to leave and go back to China and lends his tape recorder to the main charatcher to record his sadness ( a very touching scene) which he will take back to his homeland (in an attempt to remove his sadness from him).

What inpressed me about this film was how the director drew me into the various scenes; like when the one characther was falling down drunk on the street corner in front of a bar in the early morning hours; or the rundown Argentine apartment with the ratty mattress etc. and finally the drive to the waterfall or when the helpless lover realizes that boyfriend has left him for good add to a nuance that moves you past of any obvious plot.

This is a different film to be sure, but one that stands out in its own style and you appreciate, in the end what the director and the screenwriters meant to deliver; that there are dysfuctional relationships in this world, and not every story has a happy ending.

One negitive point I wish to point out is that sometimes it was diffficult to read the subtitles due to the background color of some scenes.

To describe the plot would be pointless, as the film forgoes conventional story-telling narrative in favor of painting moods and depicting emotions. The film (much of it set in Argentina) creates a haunting sense of loneliness and isolation while exploring the main character's (played by Hong Kong star Tony Leung) rocky relationship with his lover, his futile crush on a younger man, and his distaste for his surroundings. The film isn't completely sad, though, as the end of the film is remarkably uplifting.

I was so impressed with Happy Together, I rented the only other film by Wong Kar-Wai I could find, Chungking Express, which is also excellent.  I wish it also was a gay film.
Happy Together is not an easy film, however.  It depicts a drawn out and very messy breakup of two desperately in love young men.  There is the expected difficulty of it being a foreign language film and I was put off by the sometimes very poor subtitling (it shouldn't be that hard to find someone in Hong Kong who speaks good English, should it?)  Besides stupid grammatical errors, the words sometimes do not seem to match the tone of voice or actions on screen, more so for Ho Po-Wing than for Fai Yui-Lai; I kept wondering what was being lost in the translation.
On many subsequent viewings I have come to appreciate the musicality of the language and it is part of my enjoyment of the film.  When I replay the scenes in my mind, I hear them as well as see them -- perhaps the influence of Chang?  But I am still irritated by the subtitles.
I was also put off by the intensity of Fai's anger, which it took me a long time to figure out.
Despite these difficulties, I loved the sound track and cinematography and they were enough to keep me watching while the story was leaving me cold.  The opening scenes in Argentina are reminscent, for me, of Hud, a film I saw at an impressionable age, the memory of which still blows me away.  But I was not really engrossed in the film until the scene of Fai with Chang's recorder at Tres Amigos.  Once I finally got clued in to the emotional story line I watched with total attention and in no time Happy Together has become one of my favorite gay films.
When these two are in love - the dance scenes in the tenement kitchen are particularly well done - they are a joy to watch.  When they are fighting, I can't take my eyes off of them.  The anguish which the two feel, particularly Ho, when they realize it's really over, is very powerful.
Fai's visit to the night market at Taipei sets off some very loud chimes in the back of my head.  I've done something like that in pursuit of a not-quite-available crush.
I highly recommend this film.  Visually it may immediately draw you in, as it did me.  On other levels, it may be more difficult to appreciate, but give it time and you will be rewarded with a great, if not happy, love story.  Since most of us have gone through at least one messy breakup, it's a story that's not hard to relate to.",1011139200,12,2615,4.380952380952381
960771,5,6305074011,"Enough has been said about Wong Kar Wai's brilliant visual direction.  It might be a little too much to say that he revolutionizes the state of world cinema as there is no such revolution in the recent years the way the French New Wave changed the look and image of the cinematic world in the 60s.  However, you can definitely sense that the ambition is there.
It takes courage to make a romantic gay film.  It takes all the courage in the world to make a romantic Chinese gay film set in latin America.  How many people in the world can actually say, 'hey, I can identify with this movie,' apart from its portrayal of love's imperfection.  Unrequited love is a theme that is present in almost every Wong Kar Wai movie and it is amazing that at this point he has not worn the viewers down.  It is his ability to deliver a somewhat new perspective with every film that keeps a fan like me coming back again and again to watch what he has to offer.  This movie is no different.
This movie has the two best actors that Hong Kong has to offer and they don't pull any punches here.  The partnership between Wong with Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Leslie Cheung Kuo Rung stretches far back.  It seems that Wong has the ability to draw the best out of these two actors.  Tony Leung would go on to nab the Best actor award in the Cannes film festival with his role in 'In the Mood for Love,' another movie by Wong.  Unfortunately, Leslie Cheung had been typecast as an effiminate leading man once too often that this movie does not showcase his acting prowess as much as it could be.
This is perhaps one of the most romantic movie I have ever watched in the recent years.  It would be a gross injustice to simply label this film as a gay flick.  Wong will show you that love is universal regardless of ethicity, nationality or sexual orientation.  As corny and preachy that might sound, you have to look at the odds (by the virtue of the character placements) the movie has to overcome to carry this message across.  And when I still daydream about being able to catch a  glimpse of the Iguacu Falls in its glory with my loved one, you can say that the movie has succeeded beyond all expectations.",1005609600,11,2183,4.3399014778325125

But each time, I just wanted to slap myself because I had been told and knew deep down inside, it was a great movie.  And finally, the third time I saw it, the movie just captured my heart.
""HAPPY TOGETHER"" is a love story in it's most darkest and bittersweet form.  Two gay lovers venture out to Argentina from Hong Kong and the idea of them being happy together is seriously tested.  One lover (I can't remember the name) is stable, diligent, and so giving while the other one is just simply a selfish gay slut.  They try several times to start over, but each time, the selfish lover wants to eat his cake too.
Like all of Wong Kar-wai's films, this one has little dialogue and the story is told mainly through visuals.  The waterfall is a major theme running through the movie.  The beginning opens up in black and white and later on, when the lovers start over again, color (in a very Wong Kar-wai-esque cinematic sense of it) comes in.  And the soundtrack (mostly Astor Piazola) is just an unforgetable part of the movie.
I heard that before making this film, Wong Kar-wai was reading a lot of Manuel Puig (gay Argentine writer of ""KISS OF THE SPIDERWOMAN"").  Puig dealt with mainly the themes of unrequited love, impossible love, the love that hurts you more than gives you pleasure.  And often, his characters where pretty much society's castoffs, whether because they were gay, revolutionaries, or just plain freaks.  You can see a lot of these same themes in many of Wong Kar-wai films, but it hits the hardest in this one.
The plot is rather simple, but Wong Kar-wai seems to be the master of capturing those feelings people don't talk about-- those feelings that show up only on our faces.  In the end, I cried.  Not because I had my heart broken in the same fashion, or because I'm one of those people uncapable of attaining love.  I cried because  the movie just eats away at your heart little by little and anywhere within the last 15 minutes of the film, the tears come and you don't know if you're crying because you're sad or you're happy.",1003190400,44,2188,4.473551637279597
960773,4,6305074011,"Well, the texture of this film is familiar; it's very Wong Kar Wai, and I wasn't so much impressed by the style of the film as by the content. If you want style, In the Mood for Love is probably the summit of Wong's talent, not Happy Together. I read somewhere that Wong was interested in doing a film about a gay couple, a theme that is currently in vogue in worldwide film. Except, Wong wanted a twist or a stark examination of relationships whose nature is the same irrespect of sexual orientation. Happy Together evokes the masochism, the enslavement, and darkness of relationships between two people who are somehow just incompatible. Even though Fai and Ho are in love, they torture and tyrannize each other with vendettas of rejection, violence, abandonment, and feigned indifference. I find this an exceptional film that speaks a deep, dark truth that most people are afraid to confront and overcome. After seeing the performances of the actors and the all too truthful content of the film, I wholeheartedly agree that Wong won his Best Director award at Cannes resplendently fair and square.",998006400,10,1100,4.8563829787234045
960774,5,6305074011,"Wong Kar-Wai is a man of incredible vision and style. He will amuse you with brilliant, liquid, and playful colours, all the while saturating you in the misery of this dying relationship between these two men. He brings about a starkness as Po-Wing manipulates and abuses Yui-fai making him into almost a dog-like creature serving his every whim.
The talent and sheer magnificence of this film shows in almost every frame. It is a wonderful and torturious journey of the heart, mind, and soul. One that almost all of us have to make at some point in our lives.",988416000,2,560,4.666666666666667
960775,3,6305074011,"Nowadays, Hong Kong movies on region 1 DVD is still a small numbers in the American market. In compare the remastered with those Hollywood films, Chinese films of DVD version may not be in top form. The R1 ""Happy Together"" (1997) that released by KINO is one of the good example of that.
The worse thing is the audio part, the volume level is very low and presented in very bad mono sound. (The problem is also occurred in R1 Fallen Angels, another film of Wong Kar-Wai and released by KINO. I doubt that the audio remasterd is in dolby digital 2.0, because my center speaker is no sound, but there is no indication on the package.) In compare with Japanese R2 Version of ""Happy Together"" (PIBF-7056, price:4700 yen, released by Prenom H), the audio part is brilliant.
However, the video tranferred in R1 version is quite impressed me. It is because the image is very match with the style of Chris Doyle (cinematography of the film) that done in the film.
By the way, I always thought that the disc is released too early.
Block 2 pictures Inc. recent released the documentary film named: ""Buenos Aires Zero Degree: The making of Happy Together"" (1999). The most important parts in that 59 minutes film is the cut scene, you will see the alternative version or vision of that film, for instance: Lai (Tony Leung) meets a female character on trip to waterfall and the death of Lai. It is not for promotion purposed, it is really a documentary about ""Happy Together"". If this documentary could be included on DVD, it would make the DVD most perfect. I wish that KINO would released a new DVD special edition of Happy Together with the documentary film and remake the audio channel.
Personally, I hope the disc could be released by Criterion. I'm so sure that if that come true, the disc would not be the same. Finally, If you are a fan of Wong Kar-Wai, don't miss his new movie: ""In the Mood for Love"" (2000).",974419200,17,1906,4.5436046511627906
960776,5,6305074011,"Happy Together, by Chinese director Wong Kar-Wai, is one of my all-time favourite movies, and - along with The Tango Lesson - one of the movies that has affected me the most.  To me, HT is one of those (rare) art  products that manage to combine formal beauty, intellectual sharpness and  emotional depth all into one.

I have watched HT many times, and each time  I felt that it had a new meaning to convey.  My impressions about this  movie have therefore shifted with time, leading me not to a definite  interpretation but to the knowledge that art - as life itself - can be  looked at from different points of view.

The story line is quite simple:  two lovers leave Hong Kong and go to Argentina; once there, they argue so  much they decide to break up; one of them (Ho Po-Wing) prostitutes himself,  while the other (Lai-Yiu Fai) works in a tango-bar and virtuously puts  money aside to return home; one day, chance unites them and for a short  while they live happily together; inevitably, however, the friskier one  becomes dissatisfied with their conjugal life; they separate again, and  this time it's really the end.  Needless to say, the movie's title - as  light-hearted as it sounds  - is actually quite deceiving: the two men's  relationship turns out to be a rather ""unhappy"" one.

The first few times  I watched HT I couldn't help feeling disgusted by Ho Po-Wing's moral  hideousness - I thought of him as the negative-model the movie meant to  point the finger against.  I thought the movie proved that although there  are no ""real heroes"" some people do behave better than others, and that by  self-discipline one could ""redeem"" one's soul...  I thought the movie was  about Aesthetics as a means of purification, as if Beauty could protect one  from squalor.  I admired Lai-Yiu Fai and mercilessly condemned Ho  Po-Wing.

I still admire Lai-Yiu Fai, of course, but I now feel I was too  superficial in judging Ho Po-Wing.  I see he's not the monster I made him  out to be in the past: he's a victim of his own temperament, a person  misfortunate to the point of being unable to grasp the good life offers  him.  In this, I feel he well portrays many homosexuals, who, I'm afraid,  often let happiness slip out of their hands, perhaps because a sick  environment has taught them not to ""love"" but to ""want.""  In my opinion,  not only are we ""all the same when we feel lonely,"" as Lai-Yiu Fai puts it  - that is: inclined to promiscuous sex - we're also ""all the same"" in that  we are all constantly on the verge of self-inflicted unhappiness.

Last  time I watched HT, about a week ago, I got extremely sad, because I  realised how easy it is for anyone to fall, and because through experience  I've come to understand that so many of us are like Ho Po-Wing, damned to  suffer the pains of degradation and solitude because of our  ""insatiability.""  We are taught that since we aren't attracted to someone  of the opposite sex we are ""bad"" and have no values.  Of course the effect  of this is that we end up believing they are right.  Thus, monogamy and  fidelity become accessories, as tenderness and mutual support.

To me,  Happy Together is about all this.",964224000,94,3179,4.571428571428571
960854,5,6305074011,"This is about a tumultuous, sad relationship that just happens to be between two men. It's superbly acted and with yet another exquisite performance by Leslie Cheung. One is the destructive loser while the other  tries to keep the pieces of their lives together..""I had no regrets  'til I met you, now my regrets could kill me"". Wong Kar-Wai has a way  of filming decadence, and the confusion and pain that surrounds it in such  a compelling way...filmed in Argentina, the sounds of the country are  captured so well it's as if I was there..which brings me to one of my  favorite scenes, when the young Chang (Chang Chen, he's wonderful !)  explains how you can see better with your ears.  This marvelous film is so  real, that if you have had a failed relationship in your life, you'll find  one or more scenes that will make you think ""I remember that..."".",964051200,8,858,4.5855263157894735

960856,1,6305074011,"I'll begin my review of ""Happy Together"" by acknowledging that viewing this film appears to have been a positive experience for most of the other reviewers.  To briefly summarize, other reviewers claim that this  movie is ""painfully honest"", ""involving"",  ""masterfully directed"", and ""artistic.""  Therefore, if  you are reading my review because you are thinking of renting ""Happy  Together"", I want to stress to you that my bad experience with this  movie appears to be the exception rather than the rule.
Now that I have  made my disclaimer, I will go on to describe my impressions of ""Happy  Together.""  First and foremost, I think the movie is extremely  monotonous.  The two main characters argue, make-up, argue, make-up, argue,  make-up, etc. etc. for what seems like at least three hours.  Interspersed  between these recuring spats are endlessly repeated scenes of people  working and talking in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, endlessly  repeated scenes of people playing soccer in the street, and endlessly  repeated scenes of people walking through traffic.  This is about all that  happens throughout the first hour and 15 minutes (which is as much as I  could stand to watch).
Second, I think that the main characters are  severely underdeveloped.  I can describe everything I know about these two  guys in three sentences:  1.  One guy realizes that the relationship has  become unhealthy, but is somewhat reluctant to put an end to it  once-and-for-all. 2.  The other guy is extremely dependent on the first  guy, and stubbornly resists attempts to end the relationship. 3.  Both guys  are really lonely, and this is the real reason they continue their  relationship.
This is truly all I can say.  Otherwise, these two guys are  a complete blank slate.  As a result of this lack of character development,  I was sick to death of both of them within about 15 minutes.
Finally, I  think the attempts at innovative cinematography and ""artistic  symbolism"" are contrived, pointless, and often annoying.  For example,  the speeding up and slowing down of the film speed adds nothing  aesthetically, and in fact only serves to make the cinematography seem  jerky and difficult to follow.  I also think that the still shot of the  waterfall near the beginning of the movie is badly photographed and far too  lengthy (I'd guess over a minute long).
Perhaps ""Happy  Together"" redeems itself during the final half-hour.  After about an  hour and fifteen minutes of seemingly endless bickering and sophomoric  attempts at ""art"", I could bear no more and went to bed.  If you  choose to view ""Happy Together"", perhaps you could let me know  whether the bickering was ever resolved.",953164800,8,2690,5.036613272311213

The things I find best about Wong  Kar Wais films are that you never understand them fully until they are  over, and he can say so much more without dialogue that any other director,  ever.",932688000,,520,4.608695652173913
960859,5,6305074011,"This is one of those terrific films that is about much more than it shows, a movie that is so gloriously, rapturously, intensely cinematic at its core that a literal recap of its narrative line misses the point, if not  altogether betrays it. Two young Hong Kong men are lovers breaking up in  Buenos Aires. One is a gigolo, the other takes dreary jobs as a doorman and  in an abbatoir to support them. The ""responsible"" one meets  another young emigre from the Orient (Taipei) and they become good,  platonic friends who discuss their tramping around the world and how life  will be when they ""grow up."" The lovers finally break up in  Argentina and the ""responsible"" one returns to Hong Kong, ready  to get on with his life. That's what this movie shows you. Ah, but it's a  great movie, so, what it shows you is only half as important, if that, as  HOW it shows you what it shows you. Adopting what one might call the  ""collage-ist"" aesthetic of the 90s, ""Happy Together""  shows you tortured people caught in the complex tumbril of their lives,  people weaving like drunks in and out of their various contexts so that, by  the film's end, you have a wonderful idea of who they are...how they look  and sound and smell and why they matter. Using very different approaches to  black-and-white and color cinematograpy, pop music and classic tango,  jump-frame camera movement and stable framing, in other words, a  sensationally eclectic cinematic vocabulary, ""Happy Together""  stuns and arouses you, not with the potential prurience of its lovers'  homosexual affair, but with the solipsistic intensity of life among today's  generation of young airplane arabs, creating the spectacle of people  engulfed in an ongoing state of self-imposed cognitive dissonance and  social estrangement, people whose concept of ""home"" grows ever  weaker as they tramp from setting to setting in extreme contrast with what  home ever was, or could be, for them, only to emerge with an appetite for  meaning. It's about the dawn of maturity worlds away from where one first  began growing up. And if this ""explanation"" of this movie sounds  dull or confusing, well, that's how it should be. My inadequacies as a  writer aside, ""Happy Together"" is a film and its theme suits its  form and none other. So pop this lollipop of a movie in your mouth and  enjoy modern moviemaking at its most immediate and provocative.",931824000,4,2397,4.830049261083744
