8448866,5,B004YVF600,"Finally a DVD version of this television style film is out and much better than the VHS tape. Cheryl Ladd played an American traveling from Venice, Italy aboard the Orient Express to Paris, France with her photographer friend, Ruby Wax OBE (before she became famous for being a television personality). Stuart Wilson played the man who got away years earlier. Aboard the same orient express, Cheryl Ladd's Lilly and Stuart Wilson's Alex Woodward meet again years later. Lilly now works in New York City in the magazine business. Alex still lives in London, England.

I really enjoyed the DVD version better than the VHS tape. It's a nice television style film with romance, great scenery and typical lifetime for women style romance novel. I bought the DVD because Ruby Wax is in it and it is one of her better performances in film. She played Susan Lawson, a New York City photographer, on her first trip to Europe. The film has its moments though. Wax comes across over the top as somewhat obnoxious and loud. Cheryl Ladd and Stuart Wilson are believable as long lost lovers reunited aboard the Orient Express.",1524355200,,1112,4.821989528795812
8448867,5,B004YVF600,"This film tears at my heart strings, and I've watched it more than 15 times...  I absolutely love it...
It's sweetly and stormily romantic, and starts off beautifully, on a boat riding the twisted canals, and under the bridges of one of the world's most beautiful cities.... Venice.
It moves very quickly to that city's canal-side train station, with our lovely leading lady, as well as her quirky female friend and coworker, boarding the magnificently luxurious train now headed for Paris.  Wasting little time,  the real story comes out, with the appearance of an unexpected, and '''very unwelcome''' fellow passenger..
The story from there, is told not only present time, but also in a series of meaningful flashbacks.  They vividly tell the story of two young lovers, where you will now see the past from not only her side, but also from his.... This adds so much meaning to the story.  From there, there is now the heartbreaking new possibility of renewing that love, a decade and more later..
It's romantically believable, and with beautiful 1980's clothing, as well as a handsome and likeable leading man.  A story that so many of us would have certainly loved to have included ourselves in, played out in real life.... And who wouldn't in such lovely locations, and with ''such a man''.  Betrayal, Honor, and Heartbreak.
Of course, there is an additional side story of the whirl wind romance of the quirky friend, of which I found the possibilities of a long range romance being far less enduring.
Currently, I have this film only on ''a very poor quality copy''  VHS Tape..
I'm saving my old DVD/VHS player to use, specially to watch some of these older films, and I watch this one at least once a year, on cloudy stormy days..
I hoping someday, this will someday become available in DVD, IN '''''USA VIEWABLE FORMAT'''', which I imagine, is region 1?",1417737600,,1860,4.808777429467084
8448868,5,B004YVF600,"Romance on the Orient Express was a wonderful romantic movie actually set on the Orient Express luxury train through Europe.  The other film that I loved as much as this on a similar theme was Love with a Perfect Stranger with Daniel Massey. The Italian scenery was wonderfu, especially around Firenzel and I can't understand why it is not available as a DVD - Love with a Perfect Stranger has a very romantic and surprising ending.  I recommend that you all buy it and please persuade Amazon to release it immediately.  Two wonderful European train journeys.

8448871,5,B004YVF600,"I had a copy of this movie on VHS in 1990 which I lost. I have been looking for a replacement since then. I was so elated when I found it on Amazon. I had been looking all these years for the wrong title, I was looking for ""Love on the Orient Express"" instead of "" Romance on the Orient Express"". I'm glad that it was on DVD. The price I paid was far less than expected and the quality was great.

THANK YOU AMAZON!!!",1346716800,2,417,3.9058823529411764
