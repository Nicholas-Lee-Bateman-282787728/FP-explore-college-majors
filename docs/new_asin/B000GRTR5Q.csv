8133962,4,B000GRTR5Q,The story line is compelling and real for a troubled young girl and her new group of friends.  Matthew Cooley does an outstanding in his supporting role.  He could easily have maintained the top male role.  I look forward to seeing him in more films.  Good first try. I do like the original cover better.  The men play a very important role in the film.  The poster is more impressive.,1299715200,,385,4.428571428571429
