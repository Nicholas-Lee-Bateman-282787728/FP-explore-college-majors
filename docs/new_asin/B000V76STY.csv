8216938,4,B000V76STY,"I watched Cimarron Strip as a young teenage girl. I liked Stuart Whitman and I liked Jill Townsend. But I had spotted Randy Boone on ""The Virginian"" a few years earlier, and I liked him too. This is about the only episode where Francis, played by Randy Boone was part of the plot. I'll never forget that Marshall Jim Crown passed by the empty water tank without knowing that was where Francis had been hidden. It's about the only episode I remember seeing. I never forgot the title of it - because the train only went through that town ""once in a blue moon"" - hence the title - The Blue Moon Train.",1268006400,2,598,4.300884955752212
