1862527,4,B00008V3EX,"Somerville House has aquired a near perfect print of Crime Busters. Lets hope Somerville House will follow this with more quality Hill/Spencer films.  For those of you who don't know Hill and Spencer - Crime Busters is typical - A modest budget, with the general mood of a Tom amd Jerry cartoon, (Hill = Jerry, Spencer = Tom, the bad guys = a multitude of Elmer Fudds). Lots of funny gags, ""good natured"" fist fights, bean eating, property destruction, and automobile damage.  Grunts, glares and hammer fist hits (by Bud), goofy acrobats (by Hill)  - and no sex or bad language. Great for kids,fun for adults.",1185494400,7,609,4.726415094339623
1862528,3,B00008V3EX,This Bud Spencer/Terrence Hill movie is another classic spaghetti movie.  The quality could be better but it is entertaining in that slapstick kind of way.  It actually has a story and plot which makes it easier to follow than some of their other movies.

1862536,1,B00008V3EX,"Bait 'n' switch! False advertising! How dare you put on the cover a picture of a 1930's James Cagney, title these DVDs ""The Crime Busters Collection"" and put Cagney's name on the top of the list. With only one of his movies! And not a crime movie but a noir war movie from 1945!  And one of his most mediocre roles!

I'm an amateur expert on James Cagney ever since I first saw ""The Public Enemy"" when I was 13 years old.  If you're going to talk about crime movies with Cagney, you've simply got to include at least a few of:

The Doorway to Hell (1931) murderer
Smart Money (1931) gambler/gangster
The Public Enemy (1931) gangster movie which launched his career
Hard to Handle (1933) hustler
Lady Killer (1933) crook who becomes a movie star
Picture Snatcher (1933) newspaper reporter who's framed for murder
Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) Gangster w/Humphrey Bogart--famous scene of turning coward when he's about to get the chair
The Roaring Twenties (1939) Gangster w/ Humphrey Bogart--famous death scene when he's shot trying to save his ex-girl
The Oklahoma Kid (1939) cowboy robber--also with Humphrey Bogart!
White Heat (1949) he's one of the maniacal gangsters on the screen
Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1950) immoral criminal
Love Me or Leave Me (1955) crook who keeps beating up Doris Day (real-life Ruth Etting)
Shake Hands with the Devil (1959) Irish rebel who wantonly kills anyone who doesn't support The Cause

...if you're going to talk about crime busters you have to go to where he was the buster of crimes:

The Mayor of Hell (1933) he's a racketeer who is rehabilitated when he cleans up a corrupt reform school
He Was Her Man ((1934) crook who tries to steal engaged Joan Blondell but winds up being murdered to protect her
""G"" men (1935) crook inspired by assassinated friend's death to join the FBI
Each Dawn I Die (1939) falsely accused of murder and goes to prison w/ George Raft
Great Guy (1937) stops crooks from cheating the system

In many other of the top list of movies, he is also reformed but often dies in the end for his earlier misdeeds. (In each of their 3 movies together, he shoots and kills Humphrey Bogart, my other screen idol.)

Of the other movies in this pitiful collection, only ""D.O.A."" is worth watching.

While there are a number of characters in The Hitch-Hiker, the movie belongs to three men; Edmund O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy and William Tallman. There is no weak link in this trio.

1862565,5,B00008V3EX,"This is a wonderful set of less familiar oldies. I won't review the films in any detail, but will say that they are all enjoyable for fans of old movies. (I found the so-called classic D.O.A. clunky and uninteresting, but at least I've now seen it. The rest were exciting.) The Product Description summaries give a good idea of the variety of plots and actors in the set. At this great price, the set is worth buying just to see young Yul Brynner as a blood-curdlingly evil drug lord. But there are many other treats as well. I couldn't pick a favorite, but I have a special fondness for Blood on the Sun, in which Cagney does his own (limited and realistically awkward) judo and stunts and which shows the general Japanese population as victims of, not complicit with, the militarists in their country. Transfer quality was good. I intend to buy a lot more sets from this company, and hope they put out a Crime Busters 2 collection.",1280188800,15,933,4.5266272189349115

Doesn't matter...it's a hysterical cult classic made known to most by extensive runs on HBO in their early days.

I kind of worried when ordering the DVD that watching the movie today wouldn't be as positive an experience as it was back then, having not seen it in about 20 years.  But it is.  You'll laugh so hard, you'll get kicked out of Canada.",1275868800,3,636,4.651785714285714

1862568,4,B00008V3EX,"- Police Captain, gazing at Hill's messed-up police car: ""Isn't there, ah, supposed to be a door on both sides?""
- Terence Hill: ""You don't miss a trick, eh, Chief?""

Before MIAMI VICE came along, Terence Hill and Bud Spencer patrolled the streets of Miami, which probably sucked for the good citizens of Miami. CRIME BUSTERS, a.k.a. I DUE SUPERPIEDI QUASI PIATTI (its Italian title), is the first Terence Hill/Bud Spencer movie for me, and from what I hear, this is one of their very best pairings. It's certainly good enough that I now plan to check out other pictures teaming up these two.

CRIME BUSTERS came out in 1977, so there's a dated look and feel to it, as well as a whole bunch of dubbing going on. Doesn't stop it, though, from being dang entertaining and a very funny odd couple film. Two strangers, Matt Kirby (Terence Hill) and Wilbur Walsh (bearish Bud Spencer), cross paths and, both fed up with not getting work, plot to rob a supermarket. Deciding to break in thru the supermarket's service door, they instead land in a police recruiting office - and end up signing on reluctantly. Unwilling recruits that they are, they don't go out of their way to conform, hoping to get bounced off the force. Except that every bumble seems to result in a crook being nabbed and the police captain heaping praises on Kirby (as for Walsh, the captain just keeps ordering dude to shave).

I got a good vibe from the very start. The opening sequence features thugs in suits at the dock getting beat down silly and their auto demolished by Bud Spencer. A bit later, Terence Hill comes around and administers the same treatment. Having seen Terence Hill before in the classic western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-Is-Nobody/dp/B0007M21Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name Is Nobody</a>&nbsp;and now here, I'm betting that this is his patented film persona - innocent, piercing blue eyes masking a quick-thinking, playful demeanor, until the boyish grin gives it away. My guess is that gruff, surly and laconic is how the bearish Bud Spencer usually plays his roles. These cats remind me in some ways of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in their Road pictures. There's that goofy synergy between Hill and Spencer, the crackpot premise and the wacky tone of the flick, not to mention the cheerful incidental backstabbings they inflict on each other. Even closer to home, I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that CRIME BUSTERS partly inspired the zany POLICE ACADEMY series.

It's a rugged brand of slapstick, as our likeable rogues often get themselves in fighty fight situations. Thankfully, the brawls are staged interestingly and rife with amusing touches. Case in point, the diner skirmish in which Hill pretends to be a cripple and Spencer, a deaf-mute, or the rumbles at the football stadium and at the bowling alley. There's a hint of Jackie Chan in these fights, not so much in the way of wushu or nimble gymnastics, but more in that there's kind of a Three Stooges flavor in the way that Hill and Spencer (and Jackie Chan) conduct themselves. And, like Jackie, the guys make use of whatever props are handy to deliver their smackdowns. And, as a wink at Terence Hill's spaghetti westerns, included in the training segment is a scene at the police firing range, in which Hill fires off his weapon in the Old West's quick draw fashion and then states: ""I've got bullets in my blood.""

This DVD does offer up some bonus stuff: text biographies on Terence Hill (who was christened Mario Girotti), Bud Spencer (christened Carlo Pedersoli), and Director Enzo Barboni; an interview with Bud Spencer (almost six minutes long and kinda dribbles out); ""Funny In Any Language"" offers up four brief clips from various Hill/Spencer flicks; and trailers for CRIME BUSTERS, ODDS & EVENS, KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THE ISLAND, and DOUBLE TROUBLE.

CRIME BUSTERS isn't as strong a film as MY NAME IS NOBODY, but it's no weak sissy, either. CRIME BUSTERS pretty much dispenses with believability and leans on Hill and Spencer's brawny schticks as its primary storytelling vehicle. And you may just find yourself whistling along with that distinct easy-breezy score. If I got it right, Terence Hill and Bud Spencer co-starred in 19 films. So, for me, CRIME BUSTERS is one down, eighteen more to go.",1234396800,2,4332,4.943681318681318
