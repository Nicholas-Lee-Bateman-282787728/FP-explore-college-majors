3665848,4,B001KKU9DW,"This was a pretty good movie.  I bought it mostly because of the actors in it.  I didn't know much about it when i bought it but I would say it is your typical Seth Rogan Movie.  A bit raunchy at times but a good movie over all.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh.

The story revolves around 2 friends Zack and Miri (Seth and Elizabeth).  They live in a not so nice apartment and both work at crappy jobs they don't like and both seem to have problems with paying their bills on time :P  As you can see this makes for an interesting plot from the start.  They both get invited to their old high school for a high school reunion and after much debate they both decide to go.  They realize that they are both not ""Matching Up"" to everyone else in their class so they decide to go home.  Upon Arriving home they realize that there power and water has been shut off.  They then make the biggest decision of their lives.  ZACK AND MIRI DECIDE TO MAKE A PORNO! :D They have the mailing list from their high school reunion and they have a camera and some start up capital from one of Zack's friends so now all they need to do is make it through until the end.  This will prove to be harder than it seems though because Zack is falling for Miri and vice verse so whenever each one of them has to do a sex scene the other begins to get jealous.  This one will have you guessing until the end and to be honest I don't think you will be able to guess how it will come to a close.  Whatever you think is going to happen at the end absolutely doesn't and it will SHOCK you for sure.  So don't be shy and go and pick this one up for a few laughs.  Your boyfriend/girlfriend would love to watch this one with you so take my advice and get this laugh-fest home so you can enjoy it together.  Thanks.

3665869,3,B001KKU9DW,"In one of Kevin's spoken word performances he admits that Zack and Miri was essentially a knock off of Judd Apatow movies and that really shows in this film. When I first heard that Seth Rogan and Kevin Smith were joining forces I was really excited because I enjoy both of their works and with a provocative title like that I was really anticipating seeing it. It does have some good moments like the filming of the pornos, the high school reunion, and the ""double dutch rutter"" scene was humorous too. Also Kevin made some great choices with the soundtrack specifically with Live and the Pixies. The scene where Hey by the Pixies plays complimented that scene perfectly. However like I said before this movie is literally drowning in Judd Apatow's influence. Firstly, Kevin casted Seth Rogan, Craig Robinson, and the manager of the coffee shop whose name elludes me, 3 characters that have appeared in highly successful Apatow movies. Secondly the whole Romcom set up reeks of Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin with some Kevin Smith characters sprinkled in. Thirdly this movie just doesn't hit any high notes with the comedy. The scenes that were funny were decent but never anything that really leapt out at me.
In the same spoken word performance where Kevin admitted to ripping off Apatow he went on to say how he became a stoner at 40 and just sits around smoking pot all the time and I think that vapid lifestyle is spilling into his work. I really liked his movies from the 90's Clerks, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and even Mallrats, but his stuff since Jay and Silent Bob Strike back (maybe with the exception of Clerks II) has just been uninspired and crappy. Hopefully Clerks 3 is the end of this s*** streak.",1415491200,,1716,4.6480263157894735

3665874,5,B001KKU9DW,"This movie is the true definition of a romantic comedy -- the love story lots of endearing moments due to the great chemistry between Seth Rogan and Elizabeth Banks, and the comedy bits had me rolling on the floor! This may be director Kevin Smith's best movie ever!",1403481600,,266,4.5625
3665875,5,B001KKU9DW,"I'm not a fan of Seth Rogan and I rarely enjoy this type of shallow comedy, but I got some good laughs watching this.  If you are feeling down or just want something amusing and mindless to watch, you won't go wrong with this one.  It was fairly predictable, but the jokes were new and very little of that ""bodily noise/function"" humor that I'm so sick of.",1391385600,2,356,4.298507462686567

3665877,4,B001KKU9DW,I love my Kevin Smith movies. This is not my least favorite movie by him. I actually liked it for the comedy and the message of love it conveyed. It will never win an award for best comedy or even be in the running for best Seth Rogan movie but the movie isn't bad. Despite what everyone might say about this movie it left me with a want to watch it again. Plus Jason Mewes has a full frontal scene in the movie that is just hilarious. Got to love Kevin Smith. ALso if you didn't mind Cop Out this one is better than that.,1381622400,,522,3.980952380952381
3665878,5,B001KKU9DW,Laugh riot from beginning to end. You'll love it and won't want it to end. Good comedy and great plot,1377820800,,101,4.1
3665879,5,B001KKU9DW,"My husband and I were skeptic about the movie but glad that we did watch it. It wasn't really your typical romance comedy movie but at the same time the story was predictable and funny. I can see us watching the movie again but not anytime soon. Great for the price, also!",1368921600,,272,4.25
3665880,5,B001KKU9DW,"Hilarious movie!  Often the ""Make a Porno"" is omitted from the end of the title for obvious reasons, so be warned this is not a movie for kids (or young teens)!  Probably my favorite Kevin Smith movies.",1365897600,2,202,4.4324324324324325

3665883,1,B001KKU9DW,i ordered this movie brand new on blu ray. and when i get it the blu ray doesnt play. it takes hours to load the movie just to watch it once. its bullcrap and then to send it back i have to spend money on a box which means i would be paying almost the same amount to ship it back as i would to buy a new one.,1350345600,,308,3.4782608695652173
3665884,4,B001KKU9DW,"This movie is not for kids, with some pretty explicit sex scenes.  The original title was ""Zach and Miri make a porno"", but was shortened to the current title somewhere along the line for obvious reasons.  It does not show hard core sexual scenes, but they are close enough to make me give you fair warning if such things offend you, or if you have this in your DVD stack with younger kids around.  The story is about two ""regular"" folks who decide to make money in an unconventional way, and how it affects their relationship when sex becomes ""public"".  A pretty good film and very believeable acting by the two main stars.",1348704000,5,624,4.495575221238938
3665885,5,B001KKU9DW,"Hilarious movie, this is one you have to see over and over again. Everyone is funny with a little raunchiness on the side. Don't rent it, buy this one if you don't already have it.",1326672000,,180,4.171428571428572
3665886,5,B001KKU9DW,The movie centers around two roommates who are tight up on cash so decide to make a living in the adult movie industry. The movie is hilarious and definitively a good one for kevin smith fans.,1320796800,,192,4.361111111111111
3665887,4,B001KKU9DW,"When longtime platonic friends Zack (Seth Rogen) and Miri (Elizabeth Banks) find themselves in financial hot water, they hit upon the idea of making an adult film with amateur actors -- including themselves -- to bring in easy money. But when ""action"" is called, they discover their unspoken feelings for each other might threaten the whole enterprise.

3665888,5,B001KKU9DW,"Zack and Miri is one of my favorite (raunchy) comedies, although it probably isn't as dirty as most people assume. Seth Rogen is great, and the cast is absolutely perfect for the part, screenplay really hits the spot. The love story that comes along with the comedy makes for a great time. Must watch deleted scenes- really brings the storyline together. A+ for Zack and Miri!",1310083200,,376,4.712121212121212
