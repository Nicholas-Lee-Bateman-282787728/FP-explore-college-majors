1407410,4,B000059HDF,"After getting ""Thomas the tank engine & friends: Sing-Along and Stories"", I needed to find more Thomas songs and purchased this cassette too. Don't know why, but it never caught on as much as the other cassette. It is still very well done, with the accompanying lyrics displayed on the screen and very colorful, but I still have to cast my vote and say that the ""Tank Engine and Friends"" cassette is better.",1015632000,4,407,4.589041095890411
1407411,5,B000059HDF,"This video was one we bought for my son, probably at about 5 months. I do believe we have not had a day pass (now at 15 months) that he has not watched it. Earlier, he was not so interested in the stories, but he has always LOVED the songs. We have used this while rocking to sleep or feeding, to get him out of a crying jag, and also in response to reapeated cries of ""WOO! WOO!"" while he points to the VCR insistantly.
What has caught his eye is that the songs are catchy, and the Thomas clips with them are full of action, sound, and stuff that just gets his attention (duckies, horsies, the round table, etc.). The songs, stories, and locomotive sounds have definitely helped him learn to talk, and he dances and attempts to sing to his favorites. On occasion, he just sits and studies it, and then repeats things he hears. I cannot speak for others, but this was the best couple of bucks I ever spent on him. Hours and hours of use. Plus, before we caught him, he was also having fun chewing on the box - as far as he was concerned, a bonus! :-)
Oh, by the way, I like it too, it's not sacharine like some childrens works, and at the least tolerable if not enjoyable for an adult.",1007683200,,1185,4.156521739130435

7933704,5,B000059HDF,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE for a THOMAS LOVING kid.  My son can not get enough of this video.  I, myself, am getting a little tired of hearing these songs as they are playing over and over in my head at all times.  BUT, my son is in love with them.  He has been watching this video religiously since 1 1/2 and has not grown tired of them yet.",1142467200,,335,3.8115942028985508
7933705,2,B000059HDF,"I bought this one because of the 2 new stories but come to find out, they cheated us. They said that ""Trucks"" was a never-released story but it's really just a story off of Rusty to the Rescue called ""Rusty helps Peter Sam."" It's an okay story about Rusty helping Peter Sam when the trucks cause an accident. I guess since Rusty to the Rescue is no longer availible, this tape is good to get. Meanwhile, the new story, Gordon and the Gremlin has to be one of the worst Thomas stories of all time. It is about Gordon, who is supposedly being haunted by a Gremlin. But the gremlin turns out to be Sir Topham Hatt's mother's dog. The music video on this video are good, but if you want to buy a sing along video, get Sing-Along & stories. It has better stories and better songs.",1096934400,2,775,4.243243243243243
7933706,2,B000059HDF,"This has to be one of the worst Thomas & Friends releases. The music videos aren't that bad, but I usually don't enjoy them and bought this video for the new episode. First of all, Anchor Bay claims Trucks! was never before released, when in fact it is available on Rusty to the Rescue under a different title. Rusty to the Rescue came out about 6 or 7 years before this! It's a rather good episode written by The Rev. W. Awdry, but it's been available elsewhere for years. Gordon and the Gremlin has to have the stupidest plot I've ever seen. In fact, I don't even remember exactly how it went because it was so bad! I believe it involves a dog running around and somehow being confused for a gremlin when things go wrong. Don't ask me what the writer (Britt Allcroft) was thinking when she came up with that one! Though to be fair, Alec Baldwin narrates Gordon and the Gremlin better than he usually narrates episodes. Other than that, if you want a sing along tape buy Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends: Sing Along & Stories, I like the songs a bit better and the episodes are much better than the ones on Trackside Tunes. If you want a regular Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends release, look elsewhere. May I reccomend James Learns a Lesson, Thomas Comes to Breakfast, A Big Day for Thomas, or James Goes Buzz Buzz?",1088208000,3,1321,4.395918367346939
7933707,3,B000059HDF,These songs weren't so great and I thought the episodes were even worse. Gordon and the Gremlin was so bad and the other one was terrible. The music wasn't catchy and I found it boring to have to watch. Older people probably wouldn't like this. I wouldn't buy this tape but little kids love it anyway. If you want to see the music vidoes they have them at the end of the other tapes. Gordon and the Gremlin you can see by buying Best f Gordon and the other one you can see in Rusty to the Rescue.,1076716800,,496,4.071428571428571
