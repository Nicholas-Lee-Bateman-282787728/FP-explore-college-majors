7842929,5,6303295681,"Excellent three part mini-series; It's NOVA, so that's not surprising. Very informative, going all the way back to the days of Louis & Mary Leakey. It's good to see that Don Johansen didn't forget the other important paleoanthropologists who came before him. It does focus on 'Lucy' quite a bit of course, but no mention of Dr. Tim White, the co-finder of Lucy's remains. That's a bit odd and disappointing; Tim White is an interesting character, and an extremely intelligent paleontologist. The series also discusses other species, including homo habilis, neanderthal, etc.
This series NEEDS to be released on DVD... the picture quality is, well... vhs. Other than that, I highly recommend the series for anyone who is interested in human origins. It's a keeper.",1408838400,,763,5.112
7842930,5,6303295681,"I've used this series (mostly tapes one and two) for years when teaching a middle school unit on prehistory/archeology.  Yes, it is outdated and many new discoveries have been made since.  However it provides a wonderful introduction to the field of archeology/anthropology for the young student.  They easily connect with Donald Johansen, and share his excitement for his finds. Students learn about scientific theories and research and this introdution may spark their drive to delve further into the field.",1173398400,2,509,5.417721518987341
7842931,4,6303295681,"To let you know where I stand: I'm a University student; Episode 2 of this set was required to watch for a class class i'm taking. I would never think of watching the whole thing or buying the DVD if I wasn't doing anthro research. Anyways, I don't know what the reviewer who gave it one star is talking about--maybe instead of watching educational materials, he should watch Mission Impossible or a movie starring Jonny Depp--he'll be that much more entertained. And this I say to other students: beware implications of any research; most likely it is erroneous. This DVD set has errors and inconsistencies too, which nonetheless does not not give you a reason not to watch it. And yes, I enjoyed watching it.",1164067200,,710,4.688
7842932,1,6303295681,"The document is more a bunch of anectotic bla bla, full of not scientific adjectives. You will not find serious nor interesting science, rather a narcisist and boring story about the self claimed ""incredible  arquelogical"" findings of the author.",958089600,2,246,5.3076923076923075
