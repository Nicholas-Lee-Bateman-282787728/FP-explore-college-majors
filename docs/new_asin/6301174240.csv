It does contain some of his best short films (Smooth Criminal for example) which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I expected a lot more from the film as a whole. The special effects used here do not hold up well and it dampers the viewing experience significantly. Still, I'm glad I gave it a chance.",1515110400,,383,4.1891891891891895

But most of all Michael Jackson will always be looked at as being one of the Greatest most successful talented musical Entertainers that ever rocked the stage.

314480,5,6301174240,Got a lot of mileage out of this film watching it as a child in the 80s and it's almost surreal seeing it again after so many years. Michael Jackson  turning into a claymation donkey and pursued by psychotic fans...crazy!,1504569600,,221,4.525
314481,5,6301174240,"I love Michael Jackson and this movie. In the beginning it shows all the small clips of his music videos and his performance with the Jackson 5. Then the movie jumps into the story line where Michael and his three friends play together and Michael wants to stop Mr. Big from spreading drugs and hurting his friends. We see the whole music video of speed demon, a kid version of bad, and smooth criminal. The movie may not have much of a storyline but I love this movie and adore Michael's sweet innocent personality. He will always be  the king of pop and king of the dancefloor. He is such an angel may he rest in peace in heaven with God. If you love Michael Jackson and love his music than please buy this movie I have enjoyed it so much.",1504224000,4,741,4.25531914893617

I didn't really pay much attention to that since in some cases you can't even tell the difference between the regular dvd and blu ray in terms of high precision the latter always proclaims.

I especially noticed with The Way You Make Me Feel would sound good then out of no where some sound drops out. The worst was Smooth Criminals audio, which is disappointing cuz well ITS SMOOTH CRIMINAL. Again it would sound great then parts of the music would kinda drop out then come back, drop out again. Don't know what happened. Having a 5.1 surround sound makes this very noticeable. Overall it looks great but these audio issues disappointed me because the fact is Michael Jackson was a perfectionist. I don't think he would've allowed it to go out with that happening.",1463097600,,666,4.605042016806722

316098,3,6301174240,"Michael Jackson's acting is good in Moonwalker. He is subtle with facial expressions, but can ably project emotions of concern, delight, anger, and charming naughtiness.

However, Moonwalker is bizarre in that adult imagery mixes with childish whimsy in tonal shifts hard enough to afflict the viewer with whiplash. The issue with Moonwalker is writing as ephemeral as the cobwebs MJ navigates to the villain's (Joe Pesci) secret lair.

The movie starts off with a 35-minute-long montage of MJ performances and music videos. Then machine guns. Then MJ's playing with children and a dog named Skipper in a green meadow. The viewer might think that perhaps a Goonies-like adventure is finally underway.

Nope. The audience endures Pesci really hamming it up as the evil megalomaniac plotting a crack takeover. Then more machine guns, storm troopers, doberman pinscers, and Pesci's Mr. Big kicking a small girl in the stomach and beating her.

But wait! There's more!

Just as Mr. Big's about to inject the little girl with a needle full of intravenous drugs, MJ transforms into a giant robot then a spaceship deploying laser weapons systems. The kids are now sad because MJ's a spaceship and they miss him. Then he's not. Then (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Ladysmith Black Mambazo performs a line dance. Here's a neck brace for that whiplash.

The narrative is somewhat disjointed as the thin story is built to fit around random music videos from the BAD album. Who are these kids? Is MJ their babysitter? Then why is he taking them through dark alleyways to gangster clubs late at night? Why did he wait so long to use his super special secret transformer robot laser beam powers? No director's commentary to explain these things. So the viewer is required to fill in the blanks with imagination, stardust, daydreams, and magic.

Is this a children's movie? It's unrated.

Moonwalk is perhaps an anti-drug afterschool special. Or maybe a pro-machine gun and robot weapons commercial. More likely it's a never throw the ball to Skipper because he's not a team player cautionary tale for inner-city youth.",1426032000,2,2091,5.040579710144928

So one day I'm there crying and throwing a fit and she puts the Moonwalker tape on the televison and I remember she had a big screen floor model tv the size of the wall. I was mezmorized and I have been ever since that day. It was an official requirement for future babysitters to have the Moonwalker tape and if she didn't then well she couldn't be my baby sitter. I'm now 23 and every time I watch this movie it's like its my first time watching it as a 4 year old girl all over again. Michael Jackson is amazing, always has been.

I live in the U.S., and neither a DVD nor Bluray release of this film ever happened here, and this European region pressing of the film is cheaply priced, and features full 1080p picture quality along with awesome sound as well. This film showed Michael at what was arguably the height of his career, having both the Thriller and Bad albums under his belt at this time, being the highest-selling album of all time and one of the highest-selling albums respectively. A retrospective shows nearly all of Michael's greatest hits up to 1988, and such songs as ""Speed Demon"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"", and ""Come Together"" are woven into the film as ways of advancing the story as well. By all means purchase this Bluray, it's a wonderful film and should be in any Michael Jackson fan's collection!",1380672000,,896,4.713375796178344

I have always searched for new copies but it was out of circulation for a while.  So, when I saw this DVD, I had to have it in my collection again.  I mainly ordered it for my 8-year old son.  We went and saw Beyonce in concert this summer and he was tremendously amazed.  I then wanted him to see Michael Jackson in concert and this DVD was a good introduction.  He has fell in love with Michael Jacson so much that I have started collecting all of his CDs to include HIStory.  I plan to buy them soon.

However, comparing it to the VHS and DVD releases, this UK Blu-ray is slightly censored. About 66 minutes in, Mr. Big striking Katie is missing and soon after his threatening of her with a heroin-filled needle is also missing.

the new part, moonwalker, is a short film that includes the video of smooth criminal. it's a slow-paced, and michael's acting is truly embarrassing.

his ""this is it"" video is slow in places too, but it's new material that gives a real glimpse into his life and personality. and it demonstrates the tragedy of a stupendous talent spoiled by being surrounded by a shocking degree of ass-kissing. no wonder he got weird with nobody in his life to give him honest feedback.",1366761600,,674,4.608333333333333

317610,3,6301174240,"The story line is extremely lacking, it kind of seems like just a random assortment of music videos mixed in with a bit of Joe Pesci trying to get kids to do drugs. One of my favorite moments is when they take Michael's video of "" Bad"" and remake it with kids, headlining with one of the kids from the Sandlot. Do not buy this expecting any sort of cinematic genius (unless of course you consider Michael Jackson having a dance off as a claymation bunny genius) But you can expect to at least get a few laughs out and it's probably best if you get a group of friends together for it, I'm sure there's a fun drinking game that would work perfectly for it!",1362355200,,654,4.198412698412699

It is nothing short of perfection, as is the case for most everything MJ did in his lifetime.  He shared his gifts, visions, music, dance, and literally himself with the world in a way that will never be forgotten.  If you don't own this DVD, you should add it to your collection.

Let me start off by saying that I don't trust anyone that is not a fan of either Michael Jackson or Whitney Houston for that matter.  Moonwalker is one of Michael's greatest works.  I remember watching this over and over as a child along with my sister on VHS.  The storyline, the music, even the acting is great in this movie.  It contains some awesome Jackson 5 footage as well as the footage from Motown 25 when he first did the moonwalker dance.

Overall, I cannot say enough great things about this DVD and Michael himself.  Just get the DVD and trust me you'll be satisfied.  Like I said, if you are not a fan (you don't have to be a HUGE fan, but at least enjoy some of his music) then I cannot trust you as a person.",1358640000,,860,4.1017964071856285

Let me say that I was impressed visually as I have this movie on DVD and I can clearly say that this version is so much sharper and clearer almost as if you're watching this when it first came out. However, since this happens to be my favorite movie, I was quick to notice the edits made in the movie to hide any 'child abuse' and anything 'drug related' which makes the edits look funny to me because its blatantly obvious where they were made. I can say that I kind of regret my purchase a bit because those edits were honestly unnecessary and only was on screen for like 5 secs in the original unedited movie.

Due to my disappointment in this, I had to rate the product this low and it would've been lower if not for the fact that the picture quality is brilliant. I recommend that if you're buying, to buy at your discretion if you care about having an unedited movie. If you do not care for edits and looking to get the movie regardless, then by all means go ahead.

Most of the language on the back was foreign therefore unreadable to the English reading average person. Yes, I read the reviews listed before I bought it. Yes, the language issue was mentioned, but I just wanted to be able to watch this DVD of MJ again and I only have it on VHS. It was also mentioned that it might not even play on your equipment which after seeing the packaging was one more reason that I returned the DVD.

You can take your chances on this DVD for I know from watching the VHS it is fun video and tells a good story in the typical MJ style. FULL OF CLASS and AWESOMENESS. Do beware that parts of the story have been cut but unless you have seen the VHS it is unlikely that you would miss them.

I will definitely be watching for the American produced copy of this DVD and will most likely buy after reading the reveiws to find out if it is all there in all it's AWESOMENESS.

I only gave it one star because i wouldn't have been able to write a reveiw without. I can't really give it any since I didn't open it and watch it. If it would have been an American copy of the original VHS I would have given it all 5 stars.",1334102400,6,1315,4.046153846153846

I remember telling my sister, that Katie was the luckiest girl in the world and i wanted to be her for those moments in the film with MJ. I was a little dissappointed that this dvd version decided to ""censor"" a little scene, which i loved from the original. In the original Joe Pesci has the little girl by her hair, grabs a syringe and tells Mike ""I only want to get poeple high"", which then follows Mikes all to sweet response ""do it and your dead""... this scene was cut!! I couldn't believe it, i thought that was a great scene it showed him defending Katie. i assumed it was to censor the drug reference and showing the syringe... i don't know but to be honest that was my only disappointment. Nevertheless I love this movie and show it to my kids who have in turn fallen in love with Michael as i have years ago... which shows that his music goes beyond his years... and will live on forever!

The clarity of the picture and sound of this remaster is amazing.  I have never owned any of the DVD releases so the last mental image I have of this movie is in it's original grainy VHS glory. Watching this movie in blu-ray for the first time was truly an entirely new experience.  The audio is dynamic and brings you in from the beginning of the movie.  The picture clarity (in comparison to the VHS) is like putting on glasses for the first time.

Good news for those concerned with the country restrictions (as this is a EU release)...it worked perfect on my Toshiba and should definitely work on your Blu-ray.

Now, the not so good stuff...

This may be nitpicking, but I'm not too fond of the reconstructed cover.  I understand there are certain limitations because of the size of the blu-ray case, but I'm never a fan of drastically changing original cover art.

The biggest complaint I have of this particular release of ""Moonwalker"" is that they edit out some of the original film. Nothing big. Relatively small sequences that total about 30 seconds of film, but noticeable nonetheless.

Overall, those two flaws aren't enough to make this a passerby.  It is a MUST HAVE for all Michael Jackson fans, especially at the price that Amazon is currently selling it for.  I am extremely happy to have found this and purchased it.

Hope this helps!",1327449600,,1467,4.66147859922179

The only difference I detected from my old VHS version, is the confrontation between MJ and Mr. Big in his lair.

318336,5,6301174240,"I bought this from Amazon uk and let me say that first of all, they make it so easy to buy from them.  When you sign in, you use your existing amazon account and they even convert the price for you so you know exactly how much you are paying.  My total happened to be $19.30 in U.S. dollars which included all shipping cost.  So figure about $20 bucks for this movie.  Which is a really great deal!  I recommend that anyone who is a fan of this movie or Michael Jackson in general pick this up.  I have never bought an imported movie before, especially since most imported movies will not play on U.S. players, but I guess with Bluray movies that is not the case, and definitely not the case for this particular Blu ray.  My ONLY two complaints, and these are completely cosmetic, is that apparently in the U.K. they like to put their ratings on the outside of the case right on the cover art and on the side of the case as well. Slightly annoying as this is not something we are used to stateside and it makes it standout a little bit as being ""different"".  I don't mind that the rating is large and in your face on the back cover, but is it really necessary to put it on the front AND the spine?  And it is not just one rating, but two seperate ratings which are the exact same (two PG symbols in two different shapes).  But like I said, its cosmetic so I will have to let the OCD collector in me just accept it.  The other complaint is that the case they use is not the standard thin bluray cases that we are used to.  It is a thicker case that is about the thickness of a DVD case, although it is the same height as a standard blu-ray case.  If you have owned any of the 3-4 disc Disney Bluray combo pack movies like pinocchio or UP, then you know what I am talking about.  The problem is that this release is one disc and therefore the slightly larger packaging is seemingly unnecessary.  Those two minor complaints aside, this is still worth getting, unless your more OCD than me!

On to the film.  Picture quality looks great!  It keeps the natural film grain while producing a very good high definition picture.  I have watched this movie on VHS many times, owned a few bootleg DVD's, and i am telling you this Blu-ray is the absolute BEST I have ever seen this film!  I am not going to review the actual movie itself.  If your a Michael Jackson fan you have probably seen it anyways, if you haven't seen it then you should check it out for yourself.  It is more of a compilation that an actual movie.  The actual ""movie"" is a movie within a movie which is really the extra long version of smooth criminal.  It has a plot, although I am often confused as to what that plot is exactly, but it involves Michael being a superhero of some sort who is protecting his children friends from a drug cartel who is led by Joe Pesci.  The entire movie surrounds around the bad album and has 5 music videos (or short films), Man in the Mirror, Speed Demon, Leave me Alone, Smooth Criminal, and Come Together.  The film also features a retrospective of the history of Michael Jackson (Jackson 5 until the Bad album), and a mock-music video called ""badder"", where children are performing the Bad music video.  The film is approx. 93 minutes.  The entire movie looks really good in High Def.  The clay-animation sequences look really nice too.  Some of the highlights were when Michael is having the dance off with the animated rabbit ""spike"".  The detail is really good there.  The live music video for ""man in the mirror"", which opens the film looks really great too. Audio quality was pretty impressive too.  All the music sounds master quality.  I don't have a surround sound or anything and I just use my standard tv speakers like most people do, but the music sounds great in the film.  Picture I would give 4 out of 5 stars and Audio I would give the same.

Overall a great blu-ray release.  One common complaint is the ""censorship"" in this film.  there is a particular scene where Joe Pesci's character is holding a needle and threatening to inject a little girl with it.  He says something to the effect of ""I just want to get everybody high, man!"".  Sure it is a shame when ANY film is censored as it can take away from the original integrity of the film.  However, since my 3-year old son is the new Michael Jackson fan in the family, I honestly don't mind the edit.  I think it is unnecessary and violent, and I have always thought that.  I was actually always surprised they went that far in a Michael Jackson movie to begin with.  I ""don't mind"" the edit.  That does not mean I support it.  The purist in me doesn't like it, and honestly I would have rather had the option to view the original version and the newer more ""kid friendly"" version for my son, but we are talking about a matter of seconds.  If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't miss it.  And the parent in me thinks the movie is better without it to be honest.  It does not take away from the overall integrity of the film to take that part out.  If you have this movie on VHS or any of the bootleg DVD versions, it is definitely worth the upgrade.  I honestly never thought the film could ever look this good.  Additionally, it is nice to have several of Michael Jackson's best music videos in high definition.  It would be nice to see a Music Video collection released on Blu-Ray in the future, considering how good the videos on here look.  Until then, at least I have moonwalker to enjoy.  If you don't own this movie in any incarnation, GET IT!  If you own it on VHS or DVD, but have a blu-ray player and an HD television, then GET IT!  Either way, GET IT!",1300320000,7,5639,4.301994301994302

318339,5,6301174240,"Of course as soon as I recieved this DVD I watched it. I happened to be babysitting my Five-year old Nephew at the time and he loved it just as much as I did. He loved ""Badder"" the idea of a kid dancing like Michael Excited him. He wants to learn to dance like that now. He also loved the fact that Michael turned into a car and then a spaceship during the ""smooth criminal"" sequence. I think watching it with him was way better than watching it by myself. I got to litteraly sit there and watch someone become a Michael Jackson fan. He would even get upset if you couldn't see Michael for a second. The best part was when Michael was playing with the kids in the meadow, My nephew looked over at me and said, I bet they have fun playing with him, I think he makes kids happy. I was like, YES! he gets it. Like Michael believed innocenct can see the truth. After it was all over he told me that Michael Jackson was awesome. I loved hearing that. So if you have a little one in your life that you would like to spend quality time with and possible make a Michael Jackson fan, BUY THIS DVD and watch it with them. If they are anything like my nephew hey will love it and say some really sweet things that you will definatley want to remember.  Also just watching it will be a great experience for anyone. You get a nice little glimpse at what was going on in Michael's head. It has a great message about good over coming evil. Its fun to watch and if you like to see Michael smile and laugh you will love it. It is definatley a must have for any Michael Jackson fan!",1299110400,3,1564,4.094462540716612
318340,4,6301174240,"I was on the fence about buying Moonwalker on Blu-Ray at first. I remember renting the VHS tape when I was 6 years old, staring up at the fuzzy image in my parents' bedroom and getting up to sing and dance along to Smooth Criminal. As with most things Michael did, it was magic! But would it still have the same impact today?

Here's a quick rundown of the movie:

-It starts with a montage of live performances of ""Man In The Mirror."" As you'd expect, the arenas were PACKED with people, and a good number of them cried or fainted during the song. There's also footage of historical figures such as Gandhi and JFK, as well as starving children getting food and medicine, and Michael's charity work. Powerful stuff.

-Next is a retrospective of MJ's career to that point, from the Jackson 5 years to his Bad album. Most of the songs/videos only play for 30 seconds or so, and the transitions are sometimes abrupt, but it's still a well-packaged look at the first half (!) of his career.

-When the montage gets to the Bad era, it transitions into Badder, which is the Bad video performed by children. It's fun to watch, but sadly doesn't include the whole song, and I wish the original video was included on the disc. Actually, that's my major complaint about Moonwalker - that it doesn't include full-length videos for Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, etc...only short clips that leave you wanting more. There ARE three full-length videos in the movie (as well as a sort of ""bonus"" video at the end); those and the main feature sort of make up for it.

-The first video is Speed Demon. It's a mostly claymation piece that features Michael getting chased by crazed fans and paparazzi. He dons a rabbit head and zooms out on a motorcycle and other vehicles, only to get a ticket himself at the end. It's a bit crude-looking at times, but it's still hilarious and a marvel of the animators' skill (in a time before CGI made animation easy).

-The next video is also really creative: Leave Me Alone. The song is about a girl who broke MJ's heart and won't give him peace, but he reapplied the lyrics to all the tabloid stories and rumors about him for the video. The video has him flying around an amusement park which includes exotic animals, the elephant man and his monkey Bubbles. At the end, we find out the park is built around Michael, and he breaks free from it. The video won a Grammy for Breakthrough Animated Video.

-Now we have the main feature of Moonwalker, Smooth Criminal. At 40 minutes long and with special effects that still look incredible, it's more a mini-movie than a music video. Basically, Michael and three kids find out about a drug lord (evil Joe Pesci!)operating in an underground lair. We move to a 1930's-style city, where Michael has the power to wish on a shooting star and turn into various vehicles in order to get away from/fight the bad guys. In the middle of the video, he walks into a nightclub and performs Smooth Criminal, and wow, it still blows me away today how great it is. From the time he flips the coin into the jukebox to his machine-gunning exit, it's pure excitement! Thanks to the HD presentation, it's even better than I remember, as you can see all the dancers and musicians in the background as they move to the beat. The Blu-Ray is missing a couple things here* but it's not a big deal.

-At the end of Smooth Criminal, Michael comes back to the kids and leads them backstage to his performance of Come Together. This ""live"" performance is a nice bookend to the video, though I wonder why he chose that particular song.

-The end credits include behind-the-scenes clips while a vocal group sings The Moon Is Walking, followed by the sped-up/blurred music video for Smooth Criminal (the album version).

I mentioned that Smooth Criminal is missing a couple things:
1. At the end of the song part (before he pulls out the machine gun), Michael counts down his steps, spins around and points at the roof. On the Blu-Ray, the music keeps playing, but the vocals for his countdown and ""BOW!"" at the end are missing.
2. After he leaves the nightclub, there's a couple seconds cut off just as he meets the boys again and learns little Katie is missing.
3. As another reviewer pointed out, a couple seconds are missing where Frankie Lideo (Pesci) threatens to inject Katie with drugs.

Those omissions, as well as the missing opportunity to add bonus videos from Bad, or retrospectives, or even a fan commentary, bring down the disc a bit (the trailer is included, but it hasn't been cleaned up at all). There are also a couple film scratches and marks here and there which could have been removed. Overall though, I'd say it's worth the upgrade to see Moonwalker in high definition. It's more proof (as if you need any!) that Michael Jackson was the greatest entertainer in the world.",1297900800,31,4829,4.571098265895953

So, it was with much suprise that after 20 years Moonwalker comes out on DVD... by Warner... and its indeed pristine quality.  4/4 on the DVD Scale. (I should note, I purchased this disc from Toymanilla Collectibles [Phillippines], so I cant speak for every seller).

I won't go into the movie description since you're buying this as a fan I venture to guess.

This is just an update about the quality of the disc:

MPEG 2  Avg Bit rate was 5.40mbps total disc rate was 7.50mbps
Region was listed as ""3"", but the software reader tells me its actually regions 1,3, and 4. (It played on my region 1 laptop with no problems).
Sound quality was very good for a product so old. Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround only. 192 kbps. (It would have been nice to have PCM encode, but hey... can't complain.)

subtitles clear.

Sorry I don't have the other version listed as 2009 release. It appears to only have a different cover, but don't quote me on it. I don't own that one.

318711,5,6301174240,"I've loved Michael ever since I was seven. This movie was the first glimpse that I seen with him and he was great. It opens up with him performing ""Man In the Mirror"", then it shows snippets of him singing as a child. It then shows Michael's ""Leave Me Alone"" video. It includes a mini movie of Michael and three children; Michael and the little girl who plays Katie stumble upon a druglord, while looking for their dog Skipper, who runs into the woods after they all are shown playing in the park. The druglord (Frankie Lideo) goes on a manhunt to kill Michael, along with his army of ""robotic machines"". Michael gets away after running into a dead-in by wishing upon a ""lucky star"" and being transformed into this extremely fast, futuristic car. He goes to Club 30's and his video ""Smooth Criminal"" is shown. After it ends, Michael is told by the two boys that Katie was taken by Frankie, so Michael goes to rescue her. At first it seems as if Michael will be defeated, but of course, good trumps evil, so in the end Michael overcomes Frankie's army by turning into a ""robotic machine"" himself (much cooler version than Frankie's army) and destroys them. Michael and Frankie have a final showdown and Frankie loses (no surprise there). Michael leaves and the children are sad to see him go. Katie takes it the hardest and wishes upon a star for him to come back and Michael suddenly walks through the fogged streets. After, the reunion they walk to Club 30's where Michael closes with his version of ""Come Together"" (I love it).  As a child, I saw him as somewhat magical, because that's exactly how he potrayed himself. He was an excellent singer and entertainer. Though, he's no longer with us he will live on through his music and his children. I love you Michael! R.I.P.",1267488000,2,1775,4.564263322884012

I had never seen this movie until January of this year and have since watched it over 20 times.  I never realised that the ""Smooth Criminal"" short film was taken from this film and to see the entire video is alone worth purchasing.  The only other thing I can say about this film is that it is Michael Jackson and that alone makes this title a must own.  There are 2 different covers for this DVD and as a ""must have everything"" type of fan, I of course, bought them both (this seller sales both box covers, so just ask them).  Once again, buying this movie, from this seller, is by far the wisest international purchase I have ever made.  It is original in all content (both box cover, DVD and the the picture and sound quality are so clear, it is almost like Blue-Ray).  Check it out from this seller.

As for the content, I can't offer much more than other fans have said. In fact, I can't say enough! Michael looks so joyful and earnest in these pieces; you just want to eat him up! I especially liked his pseudo-live (well, I guess it's really live, but given for a preset audience) rendition of the Lennon-McCartney classic ""Come Together."" His treatment is suitably funky! For comparison, go on the Web and find one of the Beatles' live performances. John and Sir Paul would have no complaints, I think.

And if you ever thought that some of his music videos...like Smooth Criminal, had a rather curious beginning and end where you though there is more to the story plot, this is definately for you.

I watched mine about 5 times now before writing this review and I have to say, the picture quality and Dolby sound on this imported DVD is SUPERBLY EXCELLENT, Im really really impressed! DVD is indeed 100% Authentic and Brand New. It arrived in tamper-proof shrinkwrap seal which you can only open by peeling off the plastic completely. The disc is brand new and perfect. Amazing to see Michael in flat screen =) Its Crystal Clear!

I'm a big Michael Jackson fan. The last time I saw this in my own TV was on VHS and that was way back when I was in highschool. I watch the Youtube uploads but nothing compares to watching it in your own TV, so imagine my BLISS this past weekend. I ordered it Jan 25 and I received it Friday afternoon Feb 12th because it came all the way from Manila, Phillipines so be prepared to wait. I didn't really mind because I found out about this item from another friend from the forums who ordered and received hers ahead of mine. And boy, its truly worth the wait! That same evening, I sat down on my bed and watched this alone with buttered popcorn and iced coffee---OH WOW! Its Michael, Michael and more Michael in all glory- that angelic dimpled smile, his fierce swagger and his bad era curls... the storyline is about this mysterious superhero or ANGEL who moonlights as a pop superstar. He fights against the antagonist played by Joe Pesci. You could really notice the influence of 80s-90s Japanese superheroes like Shaider, Bioman and the likes of Daimos to Michael in making this movie. He really is a child at heart which is why all children will surely enjoy this movie. For adults like me, its simply nostalgic and a true reminder of why Michael remains to be the biggest superstar the world has ever known. He is truly one of a kind and truly amazing! Imagine watching the shortfilm ""Smooth Criminal"" in the 1980s??? I mean, it drops my jaw even now, what more back then! I remember really being GLUED to the screen whenever I saw it on MTV and It still has that same effect to me now seeing the full shortfilm included in this DVD. And the full MTV of ""COME TOGETHER""-- oh wow, no words... no words to describe Michael here. So hot!

It can easily be interpreted as a statement about MJ's constant flight from mobs of fans, papparazzi, leacherous newspeople, and evil forces wanting to bring him down, as well as his escape into fantasy and the world of children to help ease the stress of it all.  But more than anything, it's pure entertainment and LOVE, which is what MJ was (and is) all about.",1265155200,,542,4.577319587628866

My biggest fear was that the video would be sped up as the PAL versions of the past, this video is perfectly transferred to DVD and does not look like VHS.
Don't get me wrong, it is not perfect, so all of you ""gotta have HDTV-it changed my life-I will never go back..."" people can zip it, it is what it is.

The only flaw that there could be is the korean writing but if that keeps you from buying it you have other issues.
The audio is good and the picture looked great. People, you must realize that not everything is perfect and there was actually a time before HD and 5.1 etc... seriously, check wikipedia.

If you remember this from back in the day (10/29/1988, it was a saturday I believe) and remember how cool it was back then you need to buy it.

They may eventually get around to a major US release but you never know since there are a lot of legalities and everyone wants to dip into the michael money pot, so until then this is the best.

Lets hope we see the making of thriller, ghosts and captain EO soon :)

318785,5,6301174240,"If you're looking at buying this you are probably already a Michael Jackson fan, so my information just relates to the actual disc.

First off, this dvd I ordered isn't really the new 2009 usa format.  It's actually a region 3 disc that will play on American DVD players.

As for the seller, this is shipped from all the way in The Phillipines so you will be waiting a little while to get it.  It was ordered on Dec 28 and I believe Amazon estimated Jan 17 but I got in on Jan 13, which was just fine.  Just a heads up.

For the product itself, it is terrific.  I have watched the movie Moonwalker so many times in the past and having it on dvd is something I've looked forward to for a while.  This dvd is high quality as I have watched it on many TVs/players and it has always looked good.  I think it looks best on my PS3/Blu Ray through the HDMI.  When you load up the dvd it goes straight to the menu.  It doesn't have any extras besides the theatrical trailer (which looks good too)  and it has those interactive still frame menus that change every 4-5 seconds (mostly smooth criminal pictures).

I recommend buying this if you want this movie.  I have not been disappointed.",1264550400,7,1181,4.261261261261262
318786,4,6301174240,"After many, many years, Moonwalker is finally available on DVD!

Unlike the description would lead you to believe, this is actually a Korean release (region 1/3/4, NTSC). The text on the case is both English and Korean (mostly korean, especially the back), but the coverart is reversible (to an english only version with no text on the back).

For anyone wanting the tech-specs, this is a DVD-5 (single sided, single layer) encoded at 1.37:1 (fullscreen) and Dolby 2.0 english audio (and a number of different subtitle options), 93 minute runtime. The only extras are a theatrical trailer.

The disc contains the entire Moonwalker 'movie' (concert footage, music videos, claymation films and Smooth Criminal ""movie"" with Joe Pesci) - a classic movie, especially if you grew up watching it!

Video quality is generally good, same for the audio (5.1 would be nice, but the 2.0 is very good). The video quality, however, appears to be overly dark - I noticed some ""black crush"" (areas that are so dark, no detail is to be found - but that could just be the display I watched it on. Not a dealbreaker, but worth noting. I'll update the review once I have a chance to try another display.

Some more extras would be nice, but I'm more than happy just to have this film on DVD. Next - bring on Captain EO and Ghosts to complete the collection!

Definitely recommended - who knows when the disc will release in the USA, and even then it would likely be the same exact content.",1264464000,20,1469,4.674418604651163

318838,5,6301174240,"I am beyond happy in purchasing one of the 2 DVDs that were left available for Moonwalker 2009 USA Format. I love the jacket that opens like a book and the protective box is sturdy and beautiful.

I had this on VHS and haven't seen it in at least 15 years. The stunning visual quality is amazing and I felt like Michael was just filmed. His voice is so clear and stunning. He is at the height of his career and beams with such joy and peace. I really hope Amazon can make a deal to get some of these DVDs and if you get a chance buy one. It is one of Michael's best DVD's if not the best. I'm so happy I can complete my DVD collection of him.

If you really want to hear how great Michael sounds I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Jackson-The-Remix-Suite/dp/B002NPUCLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Jackson: The Remix Suite</a>. It is utterly gorgeous. I also went to the mp3 downloads where they have Michael's Suites I to IV. I picked out some great ones there as well and made another complete CD. They were a little hard to find so I went to the MP3 area and typed in ""The Michael Jackson Suites"" and I to IV came up. I got 2 versions of ABC and both are flawless and sound completely different. Note: on Remix III the 3rd song ""Who's Loving You"" has Michael's voice so clear but the DJ who mixed it ruined it and it is unlistenable. Don't waste your money on that. I'm taking mine off my I-Pod. I can't say enough how bad it is.

I just ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stripped-Mixes/dp/B002GJWTXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stripped Mixes</a>. This CD strip away all the nonsense in the background and brings Michael's voice into your lap. Diana Ross had a hand in this and the Remix Suites because Michael insisted Diana buy much of his early work. She tried to talk him out of it but he insisted and said, ""I'm just going to sell it to someone else. What am I going to do with all this? Seems Michael knew what Diana would do and I think this is her way of honoring him. Diana does own more than 50% of Motown.

So if you can get this Moonwalker please do. Believe me you will spend many evening with yourself or friends seeing the glory that is our forever Michael Jackson.",1264464000,,2518,5.031175059952038

One of the reasons I decided to buy this DVD is not so much for me, being as the ""special effects"" and storyline are pretty 80's (haha) and was a lot more exciting when I was little :).  I bought this for when I have kids.  I want them to see what a gem we had on this earth and I want them to be exposed through me, and not through the media that depicts him in such a dim light.  I want them to be as inspired by him as I was and continue to be!  His music, vision and art will never die with me or those around me.  Anyway, I really recommend this especially as a collectible.

319014,4,6301174240,"The reason I bought this dvd is to watch a movie produced by Michael Jackson who loves making movies. I could say this movie is MJ's creativity putting together nicely the storyline along his greatest videos including ""man in the mirror"", ""retrospective"", ""leave me alone"", ""come together"" (uuuhhh I love it.. I love it.. wondering how many times he changed his ripped T-shirt, he must have kept his wardrobe staff busy), ""the moon is walking"", ""smooth criminal"" (I love when the antagonist character says 'it isn't smooth criminal, isn't it?').. with clips from his early days in the Jackson 5, live concert and Grammy performances. Also, I enjoyed the cameo appearances by Joe Pesci, Mick Jagger, Sean Lennon and Elizabeth Taylor. Funny 'MJ' scenes make me smiling and laughing.

His imaginative idea is creative, genius and original. It's interesting that MJ transformed his strong image as 'moonwalk' dancer into ... another imaginative character: a 'moonwalker' allien; shocking me after he frightened his enemies only by changing his appearance hiding into his 'rabbit' costume haha... The Moonwalker is actually a heroic-powerful character who got the power when he or his three best kid mates fly away their imagination into the outer space finding Moonwalker MJ's lucky star/meteor. Of course he only uses his power when he's in danger. He created the adventure storyline searching for Skipper (Katie's dog) and finally.. kidnapped Katie. Unfortunately after he completed his mission.. he left for the moon. I'm touching by this 'farewell' scene that is related to this mourning-year of Michael Jackson's passing.. Katie and her 2 kid mates say 'Good bye Michael..' 'I'm going to miss him' 'I wish he would come back'. She is holding Michael's lucky star made by Michael (her kid mate who shares the name with MJ), and.. does he come back?",1251676800,4,1848,5.119205298013245

Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers who loved it, but I really do think it's one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. And I'm a Michael Jackson fan. The worst part of it was the last part, with the 3 children - and their dog, who makes an appearance just in case you didn't think it was cute and sentimental enough.  Cute stuff so that your toes curl. I borrowed it from the library, I'm happy to say, and that's where it's going back, today. I was impressed by his running ability - there are a few scenes in which he runs very fast.

319017,5,6301174240,"One of the major regrets Michael Jackson often seemed to have was that his success never did manage to spill over into the silver screen the way that other 80's music stars such as Prince and Whitney Houston had. This presentation,released in 1988 is the closest he ever got. Released during the Bad tour and a huge period of all around success for him this presents Mike the artist in a very interesting period of transition. Of course as opposed to one whole movie this is more like a series of them-some longer and shorter than others. The themes that are explored in these....vignettes tend to have to do with children and paranoia,typical themes in Michael's career in general in the decade to come. First we are presented with a live rendition of ""Man In The Mirror"",interspersed with moving scenes from the music video. While Mike's performance is impassioned as always....I can't help but be reminded again of all the weird idolizing that seemed to be part of his own undoing;the scenes of fans panting at the mere sight of him and climbing over fences and whatnot. One of my favorite parts is a stop gap/clay animation presentation of Mike's early career with his brothers. Just a reminder this is 1988,before CGI was widely available so the animation has a highly organic look that I find personally refreshing. After that there's a quirky extended video for ""Speed Demon"" again involving claymation. There is a bit of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Framed-Roger-Rabbit/dp/B00007AJGH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>&nbsp;flavor to it all;again the general focus is a sense of intense paranoia about his situation. The addition of a music video to ""Leave Me Alone"" of course is the ultimate flower of Mike's paranoia during the 80's. Something about the image of him as a giant human ammusement park gives you an idea that,at least at that point he did see his life as crazy and out of control. The conclusion of this presentation is an (almost) feature lengh movie based on ""Smooth Criminal"". Joe Pesci and Sean Lennon star in this.....spacious story that seems to be an homage to all the big budget films of the day-everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benji/dp/B0002H3S6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benji</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial</a>&nbsp;to....well&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B000QQH4YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>&nbsp;I guess. The anti drug message of the story and Mike's reactions to Joe Pesci's character's attempts to get children addicted to drugs has a sad irony to it too. Mike haters might see this as some form of egotism as he clearly paints himself as some superhuman hero to three young orphaned children. The video ends,aside from a brief appearance by Mike's manager Frank Dileo with an intense performance by Mike of ""Come Together"",complete with ripped shirt and all. During the credits Ladysmith Black Mombaza perform a version of ""Smooth Criminal"" so...every moment of the film is packed with some performance. High entertainment factor aside this shows more than anything Michael Jackson at the point where he was transitioning from being a musical superstar to becoming an idolized and often overly paranoid phenomenon.........an occurance that sadly led to something sadly fatal. But for a reminder of Mike at the height of his powers,before he let his eccentricities take total control over him this is a great place to go.",1249776000,2,3702,5.819521178637201

This is one of the BEST videos I've ever owned since 1989 - came out in 1988. It is a treasure to have in our family. One of my favs is ""Speed Demon"" partly because the animator, Will Vinton also from Oregon has images of Downtown Portland, Oregon in it and the song is so awesome as are all of the songs and videos on MoonWalker.

I just checked over on Sony's Michael Jackson Web site to see if this was available on DVD as I only have it on VHS and found it out of stock. However after reading the comments I was shocked to find that THEY too were selling it for $200.00! So I took the advice from one of the posts and headed on over to Amazon.co.uk and bought TWO LEGIT DVD's of this fantastic video for under $24.00 total (includes shipping to US) from Amazon EU S.a.r. L. selling for 4.98 each. I don't care that it is in PAL format since my DVD players play Region 1 & 2. The prices this is going for NOW in the US is criminal!

319274,5,6301174240,"If I were to take a trip back to my childhood, the aptly-named ""Moonwalker"", the brainchild of Michael Jackson, would be one of the prominent stops. Even back when I wasn't necessarily an MJ fan (I am now), this movie captured my imagination. Rather than a whole, cohesive movie, it's a collection of mini-films, for the most part well-woven together. The first part is a performance of ""Man in the Mirror"". The second is a retrospective on Michael Jackson's career, with clips from his music videos and performances from his early career to his ""Bad"" days (which is the era when the movie was made, and it shows). The third is a re-enactment of the ""Bad"" video by a younger counterpart of the cast. The fourth part is a mini-movie which features Michael Jackson escaping from maniacal fans and press by racing a motorcycle as a rabbit-man and eventually doing a dance duel with him (you really need to see it to believe it). The fifth is a video for ""Leave Me Alone"", and the sixth and final part is a noir/sci-fi film where Michael and three young kids on the streets who have befriended him try to escape a drug lord (Joe Pesci) who wants Michael's head after the latter discovers his plans to get all kids addicted to drugs.

""Moonwalker"" never made it to theatres in the US (it did, however, in Europe and South America), but that didn't stop the VHS release to be sold in over 800,000 copies within a year of the movie's release. It is a truly engrossing trip through the imagination of the legendary musician/entertainer. While many musicians have tried their hands at filmmaking and only succeeded at showing that they have no talent at it, Michael Jackson surprises. Not only does he show that he has as much feel for staging and visual storytelling as he has for music, he manages to make this movie his own, weaving into both the collage and story some truly imaginative moments.

Take the midway point, where we sort of hit the ""present"". The ""Bad"" video is reenacted by younger actors, in a truly hilarious but nonetheless competent spectacle. After that, Michael Jackson emerges onto the 'streets' of Hollywood and is hounded by an assortment of stark-raving-mad, claymated fans and press. An attempt by a humoured Michael to escape his chasers ensues, but as he finds out, trying to hide out in Hollywood studios (especially when you're Michael Jackson) is about as easy as hiding the punch at a banquet.

But his way out of this situation is possibly my favourite part of the movie. Disguising himself as a leather-clad rabbit man, he manages to escape the studios on a bicycle, which transforms into a motorcycle. At this point ""Speed Demon"" kicks in as the rabbit-man drives at breakneck speed down the highway, ocean and sky. And still the relentless fans and media are hot on Michael's tail, his disguise not fooling them. This all makes up a truly stunning piece of claymation, both excellently-paced and delicious to behold. Driving out into the desert, Michael takes off his disguise only to have the rabbit disguise reanimate itself, and the two do the best dance duel I've ever seen. It's especially stunning to see the claymated rabbit dance like MJ, and Will Vinton and co (who were responsible for the claymation segment, while Michael himself is live-action) truly deserve an applause for this as well as Michael.

Following is the video for ""Leave Me Alone"", a truly imaginative, satirical portrait of the mass hysteria the media attribute to Michael. Michael humorously visualises this as an amusement park constructed on top of him, while a miniature version of him goes through a has-to-be-seen-to-be-believed tour, frequented by lots of dogs in suits. This video may feel like a filler but its imagination and vision more than make up for it.

This is when the 'movie' itself begins. My favourite part is when Michael steps into a 30s-style club and ""Smooth Criminal"" kicks in, resulting in a truly artistic music-video sequence, climaxing in the middle, when the music dies and the club-goers chant, for almost a minute, before the music kicks back in. I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you, but these are my favourite parts.

If you are a Michael Jackson fan then this belongs in your collection for sure. Whether or not you are a fan, if you want to see a really imaginative, creative journey through Michael Jackons's imagination, I can also recommend this. One thing is for sure; the tagline couldn't be more correct. This truly IS a movie like no other.",1218585600,28,4499,4.7689345314505776

319416,4,6301174240,"When Michael Jackson's ""Moonwalker"" was released on video in early 1989... Michael Jackson was still the king of pop.  If anything, this could be the final stand of this amazing chapter of his career (beginning with the release of Thriller and ending here).

Michael Jackson's ""Bad"" album was a great record,  while it wasn't as good as Thriller or Off The Wall, it was still as satisfying a followup one could expect.  He had 7 big hits (5 #1's) off this album and a massively successful world tour.  This video montage was released as his tour (which included a very young Sheryl Crow) was winding down,  and it provided a big treat for his fans...

Here's what was included:

-  Man In The Mirror - a live performance of the #1 hit (the music video for the song only had about 5 seconds of MJ)

-  a classic MJ video montage - a neat little megamix going from the Jackson Five days through the Bad album.

-  Badder - a remake of the Bad video but with kids featuring Brandon Adams as a mini-MJ.  Cute but not one of the highlights of the set.

-  Speed Demon - a mini movie making great usage of the claymation boom of the late 1980's (ie. California Raisins).  MJ fighting against Claymation paparazzi and animated as a rabbit.  The highlight of the video is the end when motorcycle clad MJ and the bunny have a dance-off.

-  Leave Me Alone - music video that got plenty of MTV/VH1 airplay back in the day.  MJ basically saying what he feels about the tabloids by opening himself up as an amusement park.

-  Smooth Criminal - the centerpiece of this collection.  An extended mini-movie also featuring Joe Pesci (right before Lethal Weapon and Home Alone took him to the next level and made him an A-list star) as an evil drug lord intent on pushing drugs to kids.  Great special effects, including Michael morphing into a car as well as a spaceship in the climatic finale.

-  Come Together - the end of Smooth Criminal leads us to a live performance of the Beatles classic, which didn't appear on a MJ album until HIStory six years later.

-  The Moon Is Walking - over the closing credits, is another video with MJ and Ladysmith Black Mambaso.",1105228800,67,2152,4.432225063938619

My waiting begins now.
And like everyone else, i saw it for the first time back in 1989 or so when i was little, and i had the vinyl for MJ's Bad album, so i was highly into him back then and mesmerized. I recommend buying his album Bad first, then watching this film for the full effect that we all had gotten back in the 80's.",1095552000,,649,4.158730158730159

At the beginning I think there's a lot of stuff for his ego but the way it is arranged is brilliant. The actual movie part of it is great with brilliant acting and dancing from all cast members, by the time it gets to the end of the actual movie its ruined by what a child would marvel at, gone just a little too far but the special effects used to create this was genious.

It was released way back in 1988, when the album ""BAD"", was taking the market by storm, and ""Michael Jackson"", was at the height of his powers. If you enjoyed the ""BAD"" album, along with ""Thriller"" and Michael's output with ""The Jacksons"", then this VHS is for you. ""Man in the Mirror"", ""Bad"", ""Speed Demon"", ""Leave Me Alone"", and ""Smooth Criminal"" represent material off of ""BAD (1987)."" While a medley of ""Billie Jean"", ""Human Nature"", ""Thriller"", ""Say, Say, Say"" and ""Beat It"" represent The 1983 ""Thriller Hey Day.""
You also get some snippets of the songs ""State of Shock (1984)"", ""We Are The World (1985)"", and ""Dirty Diana (1988)"", which are unavailable on any ""Michael Jackson"" video release, past or present. The special effects on ""Smooth Criminal"", ""Speed Demon"", and ""Leave Me Alone"" are phenominal, and rank up their with ""Thriller"", ""Black or White"", and ""Ghosts.""  Too bad no live performance footage from the ""BAD World Tour 1987-1989"" was included, but what's here is golden.

Michael Jackson was on non-stop in my house by this time. By the time Michael Jackson went ""outta style"", I stayed blasting Michael's Music. This used to come on VH1 all the time. Since I didn't have cable at the time, I used to go over my neighbor's house and watch it. I never saw the whole thing all the way through. For my 12th birthay, my grandmother (RIP) gave me this for a present. She regreated it, of course because I've watched the movie religiously since then. I still watch it to this day.

319477,4,6301174240,"Before the loss of the nose, before the hints of sexual improprieties, before the ""marriages"", before the dangling baby over the balcony, Michael Jackson was indeed the master of the universe (or, at least, the planet Earth). This is most evident in the opening portion of this compilation video extravaganza: two intertwined live performances of the singer's ""Man in the Mirror"". Interspersed with clips of the great (Ghandi, King, Kennedy, Mother Teresa, to name a few), throngs of MJ devotees are shown in various states of euphoria for the singer. It is obvious that no singer, before or since, could attract the minions that the gloved one did.
For that, he has earned his place in history.
And that is basically what this video is: a look back at what was, musically AND socially. The second clip is a montage/retrospective of Jackson's hits, as a member of the Jackson Five and as solo artist. This bombardment of songs that topped the charts in his mammoth reign further solidifies his place at the top of music's upper echelon.
Following that is a cute kiddy version of ""Bad"", featuring two members of the now-defunct boy band, fittingly known as ""The Boys"".
The fourth entry is an over-the-top Claymation escapade set to the music of Jackson's ""Speed Demon"". After that is featured the first of Jackson's ""expressions"" of contempt for media scrutiny, the appropriately titled ""Leave Me Alone"".
The over-extended ""movie"" ""Smooth Criminal"", sadly, shows how the singer has unsuccessfully moved into the new millennium. His most recent video for ""You Rock My World"" was patterned too closely after ""Criminal"", complete with a similar location and gangster-attired dancers. Like contemporary Madonna, Jackson would benefit from musical makeovers, as opposed to facial ones.
A live performance of the Beatle's ""Come Together"" and African group Ladymith Black Mombazo performing the Jackson-penned ""The Moon is Walking"" complete the video package.
All in all, this is a walk on the moon worth taking, if nothing more for nostalgic purposes to those of us that were ""there"".",1054425600,5,2077,5.129793510324483
319478,5,6301174240,"You know those movies that you saw when you were a kid and you still get the same thrill when you see it, no matter how old are you are? Moonwalker is one of those movies. Michael Jackson is the O.G. and this movie is tripped out in a good way. It starts off with his famous Pepsi commerical and from there it takes off to his live performance of 'Man in the Mirror.' Now I don't care how callous you are internally this music video will make the coldest gangsta cry,haha. After this video there are some highlights of his career from the Jackson 5 to present. I never heard a kid (Michael Jackson) sing 'Who's Loving You' so good yo. There are some short clips of his famous music videos after this, and then the full length video of Bad, which was fun to watch. This film has alot of twists which I won't give away on this review. Let's just say this vhs is a fun fantasy ride that will stretch your imagination guaranteed. The actual movie doesn't start until about thirty minutes or so into the film, right after the 'Leave Me Alone' full length video. Another reason why I like this film is because the antagonist is played by none other than Joe Pesci, who is a big hollywood name of course. The scenes where his troops are hunting M.J. down at night will have you on edge. I recommend this film to Michael Jackson fans and anyone who wants to enjoy a fun movie with a nice plot and plenty of twists.",1051660800,7,1406,4.25

Then it gets mondo bizzaro....the actual movie part..I mean yes the concept of fighting of drug lords and saving kids from the baddness of drugs is good...but turning into a robot and a space ship?

If you like things from the Claymation studio, you must watch Speed Demon. I am disappointed that a segment was cut out that was considered politically incorrect. That is the Japanese tourists with the cameras. But that's OK. If you didn't see the original, you would never notice it. It would have been nice if BAD and BADDER had been put back to back, but they aren't even on the same videos.
One of the things that puzzles me about this series is they included the Pepsi commercial and the song from Ben, but nothing about the WIZ. I loved the WIZ.
I suggest buying HIStory volume one and two along with Moonwalker, if you never buy any thing else. Truly in my opinion the greatest music, dance and special effects ever created.",1018915200,,888,4.521739130434782

319586,5,6301174240,"Many can remember watching this video as a little kid or a teenager and loving it. Luckily, it is still one of the greatest musical/visual spectacles out there. But be warned, while the film is still magical, it may seem a bit to some like going back to Disney World for adults who watched the film as a child. Amazing, but not like it was at the time. The video is pretty timeless, but the best of special effects then may not have the wow-effect today.
The review may be broken down into each section of the video. This film contains:
-'Man In The Mirror' [concert footage/tribute to great peacemakers]
-'A Retrospective Of 24 Years Of Hits' [history as of 1988]
-'Badder' [cute kiddie remake of 'Bad']
-'Speed Demon' [CLAYMATION sequence}
-'Leave Me Alone' [short film]
-'Smooth Criminal' [the 45-minute feature]
-'Come Together' [concert at the end of SMOOTH CRIMINAL]
- and as the 'THE MOON IS WALKING' song played through the credits by an African group called Ladysmith Black Mombazo.
- Man In The Mirror is a great 'BAD' concert recap which successfully gives the respect to former men and women who have 'made that change' while showing off Michael's undoubtable charisma onstage. Uses a good bit of the split screen technique, which was a revolution back then.
- The look back at the '24' years of Michael's history is great. It traces 'ABC' to 'BAD' flawlessly, with some neat high-tech transition animations aiding it and gives lots of hard to find clips of little Michael. Nice little set up of memoirs and newer memories like 'Thriller', 'Beat It', and 'The Way You Make Me Feel'.
- The 'Badder' features a group of little kids in a mini-Michael Jackson bad cover. It's flat out cute, and the kiddies do a good job. You still get the feeling that no one does it like Michael.
- 'Speed Demon' is cute and is a comical view of what Michael's life is like with his tremendous fame. The segment combines CLAYMATION with live action fairly well. The short features ""Spike"" the rabbit, as well as an all-star cast being spoofed by the CLAYMATION creators. Very cute!
- 'Leave Me Alone' is a classic short film. The bizarre carnival theme laughably, yet with a severe undertone shows the rollercoaster ride which the Tabloid and media have locked Michael Jackson into. Sometimes scary, sometimes funny or cute - the piece is unique and meant to mock and illustrate the bogus media mayhem.
- 'Smooth Criminal' is, though I won't spoil it, full of awesome dancing and an adorable adventure. Michael Jackson, Joe Pesci, and son of legend John Lennon - Sean Lennon. The music video portion is beyond belief and your kids will be trying to mimic it eternally. The action/adventure storyline is fun (a bit corny), but meaningfully set against drugs. A sort of blend between Star Wars and E.T.
- 'Come Together' is an awesome performance. The Beatles hit is performed with much enthusiasm and forms a nice triumphant little ending.
- The credits and behind the scenes selection is also very nice. The sort of chant is accompanied by the group doing some cute little dance with bits of Michael and graphic element sequences dispersed through out.
Altogether A GREAT family film that adults will love and children will cherish. Catches your attention and keeps you happy throughout. You'll LOVE it!
