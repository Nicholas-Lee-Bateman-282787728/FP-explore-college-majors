3660147,5,B001JXPC4Q,"Robbie Coltrane is good in everything he does.  However, CRACKER is where he captured most of us as fans, well in advance of his Harry Potter role as Hagrid.  Coltrane plays Fitz, a psychologist who helps the police solve murder cases. This was well before the Dr. Tony Hill shows. Where Tony Hill is eccentric and tends to live in his own world, Fitz lives large in the real world indulging just about every vice there is.  He's loud, obnoxious, a gambler, a drinker, a smoker.  His wife leaves him because of the gambling only to start having an affair with her psychiatrist. Fitz has two teenagers who he off and on parents.  In short, he's a total mess in his own life which makes him utterly believable as a psychologist.  He is also an instructor at the university level, just like Tony Hill is.  Fitz is not really a profiler though.  He doesn't work in generalities which is what a profiler does in making a capsule summary of who the killer is likely to be.  No, Fitz goes banging around getting in everyone's face to solve his cases.  When he interrogates someone, it is psychologically brutal.

The cases themselves are very good.  We open with a serial murder.  The chief suspect is an amnesiac who is found in a field near the railroad tracks covered in blood.  All the young women have been murdered on trains.  As Fitz tries to tear the suspect down, things no one else notices begin to bother him.  Such as he spots the man has never worn a watch in his life. He makes none of the motions a person who has worn a watch makes plus he has no watch line on his wrist.  How does someone who is using train timetables to murder women get by with never wearing a watch?

I've seen all of the episodes.  The very last ones were not as good as the early ones but every show begins petering out after awhile. If you have enjoyed the other British Mystery series, you will love this one.

This is a British mystery series so, as usual, the actors are wonderful.

There is an American version of this show, by the same name, with a different actor, but I have never seen it.

3660148,5,B001JXPC4Q,"Aside from the final episode of the fourth season which is the weakest of the entire series, this is television at its very best. Coltrane is electrifying in his performance as a forensic psychologist with an array of self-destructive behaviors.  As good as Coltrane is in the role, so too are the supporting cast all outstanding in their authenticity. (Be forewarned...this is not for children.)

3660149,5,B001JXPC4Q,"This is a great series, for many, many reasons. I love the fact that the name of the show is ""Cracker"" which is NOT the actual name of the lead character. This is something that would likely not happen in American TV; producers would be afraid of confusing the average viewer, who, in the minds of those who control American TV, is at the mental level of a ten-year old. Another thing which you'd never see in US shows is a leading man who would be morbidly obese. So wonderfully refreshing, mercurial, contrary, rebellious, iconoclastic! All character traits of Edward Fitzgerald, by the way. He is totally dedicated to a plethora of addictions: smokes cigs constantly, puts away about a quart of booze a day, is a degenerate gambler, yet never once do you hear him say anything about giving any of them up. His marriage of twenty years is hanging by a thread, he's alienated his two kids, his work life is a shambles.

Yet, unlike the police, he is a brilliantly insightful psychologist who seems to be able to sniff out perpetrators within five minutes of meeting them. He goes on intuition, hunches, and bold but very educated guesswork to crack difficult cases. Each episode contains at least one great scene of Fitz, in the interview room, usually seen though a cloud of smoke, having a little chat with a suspect. He masterfully employs various methods to extract the truth: anger, bullying, insinuation, irony, sarcasm, trickery, he'll stop at nothing. Quite often he reduces the poor blighters to tears. Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane is simply amazing in the lead. There are a host of great Irish, English and Scottish actors appearing as cops, victims and criminals. Watch for the gruff, grizzled, overweight, working-class, bespectacled Ricky Tomlinson, outstanding in many of Ken Loach's films, as the top cop in the middle episodes. Irish actor Lorcan Cranaich is great as a visceral and reactive cop who's constantly butting heads with Fitz. Geraldine Sommerville is very good as the sweetly pretty young police inspector Penheligan, who can't help but be attracted to the larger-than-life Fitzgerald.

Yes, we are asked to believe that a beautiful, fit 30-year old female cop would fall in love with a 50-ish, fat, loudmouth boor who smokes and drinks and gambles. Go figure! Somehow it works!

Any criticism I'd have would be that the cops always seem to be forgetting just how sharp Fitz is. Seems like they are always celebrating a premature arrest as a ""case closed"", toasting one another over a few pints, and do not handle it well when Fitz tells them they have the wrong man. They react with jokes and jeers and, with Cranaich's character particularly, open hostility. Then Fitz ferrets out the true criminal and they all have to eat crow. In real life, if a guy was a good as Fitz, he'd be the first person the ""old Bill"" would ring, and they'd be fawning all over him.

I wouldn't pay full price for this from Acorn. I usually peruse the Acorn catalog for what's available, then go to Amazon for a more realistic and ""sane"" price, if I'm in the mood to buy. For example, Acorn wants $120 for this full set, but Amazon only $60. What would you do?",1259798400,4,3171,4.749546279491833
3660150,4,B001JXPC4Q,"For heaven's sake, keep the kiddies away from Cracker: The Complete Collection ($119.99; Acorn). Yes, it stars Robbie Coltrane but the boozing, whoring and gambling criminologist Cracker (brilliant at his job, dismissive of his colleagues, mess of a home life -- in short, the typical British crime fighter) couldn't be more different from the Hogwarts fellow. This set contains all 11 of the feature-length mysteries from the show's run, which blessedly ended before Cracker could turn into a caricature, the way Jane Tennison threatened to do.

3660151,5,B001JXPC4Q,"Being old enough to enjoy the series the first time round, couldn't help but purchase all of what is on DVD on Cracker after watching the first series again ... What it brought to me was the quality of how some producers, actors etc. are able to bring realism to the set and maintain amazing characters at the same ... Coltrane has his own qualities, and is obviously an actor very rarely rivalled on TV drama, and has this asset of dragging the audience into the character he plays, and despite being this large, common, drinking and smoking machine, only seeks sympathy from the watcher, and certainly gets it ... Another nice thing about the whole series, is that although maybe shocking in the first couple of series, the quality of themes, acting etc. never fails and for this type of drama surely will always be hard to top such an act ... Hopefully in the future Mr Coltrane will seek to return to give us one or two more feature films to enjoy! ...

3660152,5,B001JXPC4Q,"""Cracker: The Complete Collection,"" is our first opportunity to acquire all eleven of the riveting mysteries in the highly-praised British television series of crime dramas. It comes as a deluxe set of ten disks that includes all three series of the long-running British mystery (1993-95), two standalone TV movies, and a 45-minute behind-the-scenes retrospective documentary.  It runs approximately 22  hours all told, and also includes, thank goodness, and thank you Acorn Media Group, subtitles for each episode: it would, otherwise, be rather difficult for us on this side of the pond to make out the Manchester accent, as that handsome, ethnically diverse northern English city is where the series was largely filmed, and the actors encouraged to utilize its hard-on-the-ears accent.  The series has shown here on the A & E network, and on BBC America: it was made by Granada for broadcast over the independent TV stations (ITV) in the United Kingdom.

Jimmy McGovern (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street/dp/B000JLQQ5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street</a>), a hugely talented writer who has traveled far on, and from, his Celtic working class Liverpool origins, created the series and wrote several of the strongest episodes.  The series stars the very large Scottish Robbie Coltrane, who took his stage name in homage to the American jazzman John Coltrane; he was better-known at that time as a comic actor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nuns-on-the-Run/dp/B0007LPSFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nuns on the Run</a>, I believe, is where I first saw him, playing with Eric  Idle).  Coltrane made the role of Cracker, Edward Fitzgerald, a brilliant but deeply flawed forensic psychologist, who frequently worked with the police, his own; and his extraordinary work in it made him famous.  He has gone on to play in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Twelve/dp/B0007P0XBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Twelve</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GoldenEye/dp/B000M53GM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GoldenEye</a>, and as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.  Coltrane is volcanic in ""Cracker,"" and there are those who will say, like ""The Philadelphia Inquirer,"" that it is his greatest role.

Mind you, Coltrane plays Fitz as an abrasive, egocentric man, addicted to alcohol, cigarettes and gambling: the character drinks a bottle of scotch a day; smokes 50-60 cigarettes, and keeps his family in constant financial turmoil with his gambling.  Coltrane is backed in this series by an excellent supporting cast: Christopher Eccleston (Heroes, Doctor Who), as DCI David Bilborough; Geraldine Somerville (Harry Potter series), as DS Jane Penhaligan; and Barbara Flynn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Affair/dp/B001HZ4K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Affair</a>), as Fitz's long-suffering wife, Judith.

In addition, the producers have gone out and hired some of the best actors around - and a lot of Celts-- for guest star spots.  The often-seen Irish actors Adrian Dunbar, and Susan Lynch each carry an episode, he as Kelly in the first, ""The Madwoman in the Attic,"" a story of railway murders based on a real murder that took place in a train en route to London in the early 90s.  She, Lynch, carries the second episode, ""To Say I Love You,"" as Tina; both are powerful performers in powerful stories.  The veteran, well-known character actress Beryl Reid also shows up in this second episode, as Fitz's horse-playing mother.  The intense Scottish actor Robert Carlyle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty-Fully-Exposed-Edition/dp/B000M341RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty - Fully Exposed Edition</a>), as Albie, a skinhead, carries the fourth episode ""To Be a Somebody,"" so well, people are still talking about it.  The almost-equally intense English actress Samantha Morton carries the fifth episode, one written by Ted Whitehead rather than McGovern, ""The Big Crunch,"" as a teenage schoolgirl too nave for her own good. The lovely Fleur Bennett carries the ninth, ""True Romance,"" as an achingly vulnerable young woman: she too, I believe, started in comedy, or at any rate I saw her first as Mavis Moulterd, country-girl/straight-woman to John Inman's Mr. Humphries in the early 90's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Being-Served-Again-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0002F6BT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Being Served? Again! (The Complete Series)</a>

McGovern's scripts are tight, cunning, and fast, no leisurely British exposition here, and capable of continual surprises.  Whitehead's are very good, but not quite.  Paul Abbot's scripts are fine, but not in the same stratosphere.  In Abbot's 9th episode, ""True Romance,"" we suddenly get a left-wing; anti-Thatcher outburst of the sort that could quite ruin McGovern's final script included here, the 2006 standalone, ""A New Terror,"" for a lot of people.  There is also a 1996 standalone, ""The White Ghost,"" nice script by Abbot, set in that fascinating and beautiful, tropical, oriental and British city, Hong Kong, in that fraught time shortly before its July 1st, 1997 handover to the Chinese.

Granada certainly didn't stint on this series; it's lavishly filmed, with plenty of cars and people in the urban streets, auditoriums and nightclubs full of students.  Direction was excellent, from Antonia Bird and Michael Winterbottom, among others. The music, from a number of talented men, also adds to the mood.  The Hong Kong mystery really gives you an eyeful of that great city.  The series won more than 25 major awards, including two BAFTAs for best drama series, and three for best actor for Coltrane.  Many critics, including one at ""The Boston Globe"" consider it the best made-for-TV-mystery or cop series.  And me?  I won't lie to you: I have always loved this series.",1237248000,91,6090,6.106682297772568

I do not like it for several reasons. (1) It depicts the UK Police as being inept in nearly every way. (2) It parades dysfunctional  characters such as ""Fitz"" around and attempts to legitimize their disfuntionality and (3) Each story leaves the audience with a betrayed feeling that not a single perpetrator is brought to justice.

I have high praises for Foyle's War and Prime Suspect but am horribly disappointed with ""Cracker""!!!

The character of Fitz (Cracker) becomes less believable as the episodes progress - how someone who is on the verge of alcoholism can analyse his clients so remarkably clearly is an issue for me. Also towards the end there is a sudden change of actors - first we are in Hong Kong with no real explanation in the penultimate episode and in the final one his wife and son are played by different actors as are the police people - and the story is weak so that the ending is pure anti-climax.

He makes the character believable and appealing through his strengths as a intuitive psychologist, who appears to be fed almost as much by his flaws in character as his skills as trained psychologist. The fact that the driving factors of the challenges in his own personal mental anguishes is never addressed adds to interest in the character as you try to find out why he is what he is through observing the examples of his symptoms (drinking, gambling etc).

The stories are very strong and so are the other police persons cast in the series. If you know a little about police procedure, it is as with most series, important that you suspend a sense of disbelieve, however it is made easier by the great dialogue, story line and strong charaters of all those who act.

Coltrane's performance is fast paced, dark and brilliant.  I first saw this show on BBC America and have dreamed of seeing the complete series for years.  This complete set was an answer to my prayers and I'm thoroughly enjoying it and will enjoy it over and over, I'm sure.  Buy it!",1367020800,2,664,4.771929824561403
3660265,5,B001JXPC4Q,"This series will have you absolutely spellbound after about 30 minutes into the first episode. It concerns a chain-smoking, alcoholic, obese, narcissistic, pompous, childish, boorish, gambling addict who just happens to be a brilliant psychologist helping the police solve various crimes. The point of the show is not primarily the whodunits, but rather the audience's fascination with the magnificent performance by Robbie Coltrane as the deeply flawed lead character.",1357689600,2,469,5.811594202898551
3660266,4,B001JXPC4Q,"This show is definitely well written, well-acted and entertaining. My only criticism is that some of the stories are real farfetched. For instance; The main character Dr. Fitz is middle aged, obese and full of himself, not exactly ""sexy"", and yet in one story a pretty young woman, at least 25 years younger, is so in love with him that she starts killing young men just to get his attention and admiration. Or a story about a woman who turns to murder because she was jealous that her 2 sisters were sexually abused by their father, but he didn't do it to her, so she felt rejected...how does that make any sense?
And Fitz is just ""too brilliant"", it's as though he can just read anyone's mind and guess events in great detail from their childhood, as well as their next moves flawlessly, without any investigation or clues. I don't believe anyone can do that.",1350000000,,861,4.561290322580645

No boring, cliche ridden stories with stock characters.  A timeless series to watch over and over again.  Re the packaging:  while I prefer metal or plastic holders for multiple discs  (a la ""Hustle,"" ""M squad,"") the smooth covered cardboard casings for 'Cracker"" is perfectly acceptable.",1330819200,,433,5.202898550724638
3660268,5,B001JXPC4Q,"In my opinion, this is one of the most interesting, brilliant et original detective series that I every seen. This role - a brilliant psychologist but a dysfonctional father and husband -  fits perfectly to Robbie Coltrane. Three time Bravo!",1324857600,,241,5.025

Once I bought this collection and enjoyed every single minute of it, I did realise that the latest episode was not very good in comparison with the first productions.  Robbie Coltrane is absolutely magnificent in his role and Fitz's humour throughout the series is a complete delight.  If you like detective and crime TV series, you will not find any better than this!",1322352000,,457,4.6875
3660270,5,B001JXPC4Q,"The series is called Cracker, as our protagonist Fitz or Dr. Fitzgerald, is a noted psychologist with a penchant for solving crimes using profiling.  I love this character because he has so many flaws; he is obese, a chain smoker, a borderline alcoholic, addicted to betting and more.  He is married to Judith and they have 2 children.  He goes to the point where he mortgages the house by forging his wife's name on the bank documents.  He lays around the house, usually nursing a hang-over from the next day. Yet women are still attracted to this disheveled man, as he is brilliant.

He finally gets off him bum when one of his students is brutally murdered to get the parents's permission to work on the case.  Eventually he ends up working for the police on a contractual basis, which gets under the craw of some of the old-time cops like Jimmy.

The series is suspenseful and well written.  It is entertaining from start to finish. So this BBC produced series holds its own.  However, I did not like the last series, as they lost some main characters and I think some writers.  However, the first 3 DVD's are worth one's while to add to one's DVD selection.",1318377600,,1162,4.543269230769231
3660301,4,B001JXPC4Q,"Let me clarify certain things at the very outset:

1) This is NOT a POLICE PROCEDURAL, neither is it a series involving the events & emotions that someone in the line of fire has to go through in the process of nabbing the bad guys and helping the good guys.
2) This is NOT a series where one sees the protagonist evolve into someone better; the protagonist here (Dr. Fitzerald, a brilliant but pathologically unlovable psychologist) remains the same nasty, caustic, egoistic, self-centered, gambling, hurting genius who can see through the criminal minds, but can not feel the torture that his nearest & beloved are going through.

Now that I have managed to write that stuff out (a ""catharsis""?), I can write what this series are:

1. The stories (esp. the first couple, and a few in the middle, except ""Best Boys"") are gripping.
2. Relationship between Fitz and Penhaligon (a beautiful Police Officer) and Fitz & his wife, and the literally cracking tension that is felt in the scenes involving them would put any soap-opera to shame any day, and yet would remain dark & grim, since there is usually a murder or rape at the backdrop of this drama.
3. Some of the subject matters, like the gradual descent of an old-styled copper into someone truly bad simply because he had failed to prevent something that he could have done, the social tension, impacts of war & terrorism devastating the matrix of human mind, are visceral and very-very grim, making viewing of this series an uncomfortable, yet compulsory task.

Thus, I rest the case. If you appreciate a good drama with top-notch acting from all, watch this series. If you are looking for something more realistic and yet with a dark hue, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B0028AEO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection</a>, after you have watched this series because it is still superior to most other stuff flooding our TV-s now.",1312070400,13,2018,5.238390092879257

Fabulous series about a super brilliant psychologist who helps the police profile criminals. While working, he's about as sharp as they come. But - whenever he isn't working, his life is a mess.

8313856,4,B001JXPC4Q,I absolutely loved the first season. It was so original having a dysfunctional psychologist  (Robbie Coltrane) aid the police in the solution to the local murders in his community. Lots of humor and creative solutions to these who dunnits. Season one deserves all 5 stars. Since this is a set of two seasons I need to say that the second season was a let down from the first. The show took on a very dark atmosphere . It did not have the same level of humor you would expect from a Robbie Coltrane performance . The episodes were built around a grizzly murder (no room for humor) and our protagonist just could not find a way to meet his life partner even half way to even give the feel that he cared. I felt this brilliant mind can solve the most difficult crimes but isn't able to realize whether he belongs in a marriage or should get out and allow this woman to move on. It was a contradiction in this character that should have been resolved by the second season. We were brought in too close to these characters not to care about them. We are let down with dealing with the same problems at home and a crime that was more depressing than interesting. Only three stars for the second and last season. 4 stars overall for a series with an original premise that was kept dragging on with no end in sight to a very dysfunctional marriage.,1443830400,,1340,4.36
