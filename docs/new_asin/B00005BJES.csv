1425315,5,B00005BJES,"Well worth viewing! A vacation, without leaving the house! Gather the family for a wonderful time to see the wonders of our earth!",1325635200,6,130,4.695652173913044
1425316,4,B00005BJES,"The photography in this film is spectacular, covering all the continents.  Well worth watching.

All in all, good nature movie!",1322524800,2,127,5.3
1425317,4,B00005BJES,We both found this a very enjoyable aerial view of the greatest sights on our planet together with an education review of the geology and geography by the BBC's David Attenborough. He is an excellent narrator and the script is interesting without being too detailed. Some elements were completely unique such as the rapid tides in Australia. The image quality was fairly good on our 6MB AT&T DSL system connection.,1298332800,5,414,4.928571428571429
1425318,5,B00005BJES,"Our Vacation Bible School theme this year was Discovery Canyon with an emphasis on the sights, scenes, and critters in the Grand Canyon. I ordered the video as a reference.  We showed parts of the video as an intro and then often kept it running (sound off) during other activities.  Kids loved the wildlife segments--especially the snake sneaking up on its prey.  The part featuring classical music with scenes of the Canyon was particularly grand as kids were gathering--we even showed part of the Roy Rogers movie--black and white--during a snack break.  We did quickly turn off the promo that listed one of the movies shot at Grand Canyon as ""Gay and Lusty""; the words today give a somewhat different message.  The Grand Canyon video is about the best $20 I spent all summer!",1250899200,2,779,4.7835820895522385
1425319,2,B00005BJES,"The DVD had a few minutes of interesting information, but the rest of it would make it a good sleep aid. It just never really captured the essence of the Grand Canyon, but instead spent a lot of time with boring, stock footage  of nature scenes. I wanted to understand the scope and scale of the Grand Canyon; the geology; and the history and impact of it. Unfortunately, this DVD only scraped the surface of that type of information.",1191974400,12,434,4.493670886075949
1425320,5,B00005BJES,"A National Park since 1908 the Grand Canyon is one of the world's greatest natural wonders. It encompasses 2,000 square miles, reaches a mile down and ten miles across. It harbors a multitude of wildlife including mule deer, mountain lions, coyotes, bighorn sheep, wild turkey, blue heron, desert tortoises and the Kaibab squirrel, found nowhere else in the world.

This DVD includes many features. Included are footage of many recreational adventure tours available in the National Park. Get the full story on how the Grand Canyon was formed. A very enjoyable section is classical music presented along with a montage of beautiful images from the park.",1108684800,35,653,5.160377358490566
1425321,5,B00005BJES,This film does an incredible job of portraying the Natural Wonders of the World in a way that helps you experience a little of the wonder. Great armchair adventure.,1356825600,,164,4.689655172413793
1425322,5,B00005BJES,We need more programs like this instead of the junk that passes for entertainment elsewhere... I would prefer more in depth coverage for each area.,1346803200,,147,4.92
1425323,5,B00005BJES,"I highly recommend this show. I love how it goes around to all over the world and shows how many amazing natural places there are. If you like shows about natural wonders, I highly recommend this one.",1346284800,,200,4.4324324324324325
1425324,5,B00005BJES,This was breathtaking and quite beautiful. The narrator was well paced during the presentation. It was a wonderful way to take a brake from a busy schedule or one's own little corner of the world. Very educational.,1340323200,,214,4.8108108108108105
1425325,5,B00005BJES,This is just wonderful!  I enjoyed how this is filmed and the narration a lot.  World tour in 50 minutes. :),1336521600,,108,4.095238095238095
1425326,4,B00005BJES,"I always love David Attenborough as a narrator and the scenery is this is amazing.  However, there is just too much to cover in under an hour.  This should be an introductory video for an entire series.  Still, this is a great video just to kick back and relax to.  Let your eyes soak in some of the most astounding scenery our planet has to offer while Mr. Attenborough's dulcet voice soothes your frazzled mind.",1336089600,,413,4.466666666666667
1425327,3,B00005BJES,"The scenery is quite nice but there wasn't anything I haven't seen before or heard before.

I was hoping to learn something but this is more like a drama than a documentary.

Might be good for kids.",1332633600,,198,4.324324324324325
1425328,1,B00005BJES,"Thought this would be a great educational dvd for the kids, but many times the term ""many millions of years ago"" was stated and his theory of how the world was formed.  This man does not believe in a Creator and expresses this many times throughout the video.",1330387200,7,259,4.395833333333333
1425329,5,B00005BJES,"I just watched this last night with my family. We have seen Planet Earth and many, many other ""earth"" documentaries. I liked the speed in which it took you around the world. It wasn't too long and drawn out. There were actually a few places that we'd never seen! Great views from space and the aerial footage was just close enough. We may even watch it again!",1329609600,,359,4.373134328358209
1425330,5,B00005BJES,"What a wonderful 51 minutes! So much beauty in the world and so much awesome energy. This was a wonderful respite from the grind of daily television. The timing of each visit was perfect--not too long and not too short--making it ""just right"" to keep one's attention.",1327795200,,267,4.702127659574468
7937919,5,B00005BJES,"I highly recommend this DVD! Gorgeous photography and music! Very informative on the Grand Canyon....history, explorers, animals, and flowers are discussed. For a Grand Canyon lover like myself this DVD is a must have!",1500508800,,218,5.4411764705882355

7937921,4,B00005BJES,"A very nice review of our trip, what we saw and what we missed. Provides some land detail and geologic history that one may not know when touring on your own.  Enjoyable!",1463875200,,170,4.3125

7937925,5,B00005BJES,"The quality of the picture might not suit our more advanced technology, but, the content is amazing. (Or it might just be my screen) Otherwise it is incredible.",1420243200,,160,4.75
7937926,5,B00005BJES,"Once I saw this natural wonder in-person last spring, I needed to learn more and what better way than on a DVD!",1376438400,,111,4.090909090909091
