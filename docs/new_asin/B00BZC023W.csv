You can allways watch it on youtube (in horrible quality) if u want to check it out before you buy it as I did.",1377820800,,335,3.8

I tried to enjoy this intended comedy, but it just wasn't funny. Further, the plot line was there but the script, direction, and action just fell comepletely flat for me.

Maybe I missed something cultural?

What was intended to be funny just seemed sketchy, thoughtless,  and bland. But yeahhhh, it could have just been cranky me....

...but it wasn't :)

Hey, others may enjoy it immensely. I didn't care for the actors, the acting, action, or anything else. It was just plain tacky, with none of the comedic verve and panache of---for instance--- Chinese, Hindi, or Korean ""foreign"" films.

I think the slightly higher rating on Netflix of 2.25 stars is probably from Spanish speakers to whom the dialogue would probably have played better than the subtitles.",1375488000,,833,4.823943661971831
