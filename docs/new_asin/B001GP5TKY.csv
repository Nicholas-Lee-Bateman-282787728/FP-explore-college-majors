3617656,3,B001GP5TKY,"As a big fan of almost any kind of dancing and Dirty Dancing the movie, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining. I am a regular exerciser and am always looking for a great workout. Let me tell you , you work a sweat with this. First, the instructors take you thru the individual steps - about 15 minutes , then you put it all together for the main dance (about 3-5 minutes). The next day I really did feel it all over my body, legs and arms. It is a nice change of pace and hopefully I am burning some mad calories without putting major strain on muscles. The music gets you wanting to watch teh movie and take syou back. I actually wanted to give this 3.5 stars but couldn;t figure out how to do that.",1233532800,8,711,4.085714285714285
3617657,2,B001GP5TKY,"First I will say this video is fun in it's way. I like the routines and the upbeat feel of the video but I was disappointed with the length and number of songs chosen. I was under the impression I was going to get at the very least a good 30 minute workout but this video doesn't deliver. It says on the package:

""Love Man"" 12 mins
""Yes"" 13 mins
""Johnny's Mambo"" 14 mins
""Do you love me"" 12 mins
and
""Saturday Night Dance Challenge"" 11 mins.

THIS IS A COMPLETE LIE!!!

I have tried running all the routines and this is only about 13 mins. Also if you try running each routine separately they are only about 2-4 mins long each. I have to do all the routines twice to get a good workout. It's really not very fun to go through it twice. :(

My other gripe with this video is that no matter if you are using a DVD player or your computer there is no way to skip all of the ""warnings"" and the stupid little intro telling you do do the syllabus first. One time is fine.

I wouldn't wast my money on this. You are better off getting one of the Yoga Booty Ballet videos or even Ti bo",1233100800,93,1078,3.9953488372093022
3617658,5,B001GP5TKY,I love this video! The routines are fun and the soundtrack is great.  Once you are comfortable with the routines and do them to the music you get a great workout.  I find myself sweating and my heart beating.  It is worth the purchase!,1232755200,,235,4.295454545454546
3617659,1,B001GP5TKY,Out of all my dance dvd workouts this one disappointed me.  As a HUGE fan of Dirty Dancing I was hoping this dvd would teach me the dances from the moive.  Nothing in this workout was from the movie other than the music.  If I wanted that then I could have put in any dance workout dvd and just play the music in the background.  Not worth it!,1232409600,8,343,4.0
3617660,5,B001GP5TKY,"Love this video, of course the music is amazing and the steps are pretty easy.  I think this tape would be more for a intermediate to advanced dancer, it might be hard for beginners.  The one complaint I have is the dancers in the background seem full of themselves!",1231891200,3,266,4.408163265306122
3617661,5,B001GP5TKY,"I own many dance DVD's and this one will definitely be one of my favorites.  The instruction is excellent, and the fun factor is makes it very appealing!  This one's a keeper! Tracey Mallet is an experienced cuer and makes it all come together.  Also there is a male instructor who is very easy to follow and is a great cuer.  This is organized very well, and sectioned out in chapters.  I would definitely recommend this to beginner or intermediate.",1231286400,37,450,4.575
3617702,4,B001GP5TKY,"While not a fabulous workout, it's lots of fun. Brings me back to the time of the movie and leaves me singing the songs. There are a number of dances on the DVD and the instructors will teach them step by step. I am by no means a dancer buy could follow along.",1467936000,,260,3.9245283018867925
3617703,2,B001GP5TKY,"I am a both a Dirty Dancing and Patrick Swayze fan so when I seen this it immediately caught my attention. As a kid I tried doing the dances from the movie over and over and like every girl wanted to be ""Baby"".

This exercise routine was not at all what I was wanting nor expecting. The routines were boring and were not at all what I was expecting I am a amateur dancer and exerciser and these did not challenge me at all. I was wanting dances to exercise with like the ones in the movies, not simple workout routines. I was very disappointed in this.",1465776000,,552,4.158878504672897

3617706,3,B001GP5TKY,"Well I guess for what I expected it did ok. I was hoping it would have been closer to the movies Latin style dancing - but it did state it was a workout.
Dirty Dancing is one of memories that started me dancing for real. It would have been nice if the video included some of partner work that made most people that like dancing enjoy the movie.

A little over 3 years ago this would have got an higher rating when I was dancing a lot of Zumba ( 4 years straight ),  but something important was missing in Zumba that got me interested in Salsa and even recently Kizomba and that of course is connection to the partner. This was totally missing from this DVD.

So will it get used in the future - not sure probably for some work outs - of course important dance songs were missing from this DVD that were in the movie.",1432425600,,816,4.119496855345912
3617707,4,B001GP5TKY,"This isn't my favorite dvd but I did enjoy the workout. My advice would be to give the whole thing a chance before giving up on it. The moves go kind of fast and the sound is not the best- but for all that it made me sweat and I had fun. The routines are about 10min each. The instructors are nice and encouraging. I would recommend buying it for variety, but it won't be your go to work out.",1424822400,,392,3.9125

3617742,5,B001GP5TKY,"Husband and I got this for pre-wedding workout and to learn basic dance moves. We loved it and had a great time dancing! It's not easy at first to learn moves like in the actual dirty dancing movie. But keep rewinding on the difficult parts and you'll catch on. It's a good mild workout and fun to do.

We originally got this in hopes of learning the real slow dance ""Time of my Life"". But it's not on here. Doesn't matter because we watched clips from the actual movie online, and shortened it for our first wedding dance. Practiced that a couple of times and it was fun! Executed well at our wedding reception.",1406505600,,612,4.368421052631579

3617749,5,B001GP5TKY,"This was a very good workout, and easy to follow.  Didn't seem like it when just viewing it, but when you do it you realize that it is workable for the novice dancer. Would recommend to anybody that loves dancing.",1378252800,3,213,4.325
3617750,4,B001GP5TKY,"I had rented this cd from the library, liked it so well, I purchased it from Amazon.

3617802,4,B001GP5TKY,"I think this dance workout can attract a wide range of people and address a wide range of abilities.  The video lacks professional finesse in some areas.  But it is still a nice starting point for beginners or dancers who lack confidence.  It's would make a nice addition to the workout collection of someone more advanced.  And it is great fun for ""Dirty Dancing"" lovers.",1367280000,,372,4.676923076923077

3617808,1,B001GP5TKY,I am a big fan of the movie and i was overly excited when i saw this.  i got it and my favorite song is not on here.  There's maybe 3-4 songs and it's very boring.,1359331200,,163,3.5
3617809,1,B001GP5TKY,"There were only 4 dances on this video.  I expected more.  I really don't need the dances to be called out and each step explained.

3617831,5,B001GP5TKY,"Because of the mixed reviews, I decided to borrow this from my library before buying.  Now I know that I love it and will feel good about buying it!

First of all, if you are a beginner, please understand that you will feel awkward and you won't get it all on the first try.  But keep up with it and you will.

I have decided to focus on one dance at a time so that I know that I could turn on the song (yep, I have the sound track from when I was a kid) and do the dance routine on my own.

Today was my first day and I am not a dancer by nature.  I can keep a beat, was in the band, but dancing, not so much.
I started with the syllabus, which is a must.  It was a nice pace and I felt great doing it.  I felt like I got it.
Then I turned on ""Love Man"", ""Learn the Choreography"".  This was also a must.  I felt okay about my work.
After that I did the full routine with instruction.  It was so fun!  Yeah, I was a bit clumsy, but I was having fun.  I replayed that 4 times.

In total, I spent 45 minutes doing this.  I can't stop the sweat from dripping!  I don't feel sore in the way of muscles yet, but judging by the sweat (I am not normally a sweater), I can tell I had an awesome cardio.

This is the first workout dvd that I've done where I can't wait to do it again!  Tomorrow even!
I'm going to Dirty Dance my way to slender!  (I'm not overweight, just not toned.)

Try it!  If you're a Dirty Dancing fan, you already know the music!",1351468800,,1443,3.791245791245791
3617832,4,B001GP5TKY,"I love the video but it's definitely more of a recreational thing than a good, thorough workout. Of course you are going to accomplish something active out of it because of all the movement, but I definitely utilize it for more of a fun purpose. Who doesn't fantasize about dancing in that movie with Patrick Swyaze anyways, eh?",1324339200,3,328,4.672413793103448
3617833,2,B001GP5TKY,"This video says it is beginner friendly and it is not at all.  The syllabus was really good and did explain a lot of the steps at a good pace but when it came to the actual routines, they went way too fast.  Very disappointed in this product.",1322956800,,242,4.020833333333333
3617834,2,B001GP5TKY,"I purchased this DVD hoping that it would give a full 30 minute workout as well! Unfortunately once you run through all of the song titles-- you've only gained about 15 minutes of workout. Very disappointed. I would save my money to purchase another workout DVD, turn off the sound to that one and turn on the soundtrack to Dirty Dancing if you really want to dance to the music!",1321920000,,379,4.428571428571429
3617835,3,B001GP5TKY,"I was excited to finally get this in the mail! I love this movie and really needed something fun to workout to since I have decided to get into shape. I love the ideas of using the original soundtrack and some of the moves that were used in the movie, but the instructional part of the routines didn't manage to get into the DVD. There is a small area to learn each move and what it is called for about 2 seconds for each move, and thats it. When actually doing a routine to the music, the counts are off, and even the dancers in the background keep messing up due to the bad leadership of the so called ""instructors"". You'd be better off just doing your own routine to each song.

overall, I like the concept, but the people ""teaching"" you how to do the steps are a joke.",1307577600,,772,4.1466666666666665
3617836,5,B001GP5TKY,I love this work-out video.  It is fun to do and allows you to work off calories and not even feel it!,1299888000,,102,3.6363636363636362
3617837,5,B001GP5TKY,It's great. It shows you step by step how to do the moves slowly at first. And if you have to you can keep doing that first one over and over till you get the steps down the move on to the faster pase on the next fase of it. And its like that through the hole tape. I beleive whoever buys this will love it is easy and fun even the kids can do it and maybe even get dad to do it lol.,1297036800,,383,3.5176470588235293

3617880,5,B001GP5TKY,"I loved the movie, so felt confident the exercise dvd would be good and I was right.  I love it!

Fantastic!",1282089600,,288,4.0
3617881,3,B001GP5TKY,"This DVD was fun, but is more of a dance instruction DVD than a workout DVD.  It does not include any warm up or cool down and stretching which to me is its biggest disadvantage.  The instructors are good and go over the moves well, plus there is a step guide if you need more instruction.  The DVD is set up so you learn each dance individually and then can do all the dances back to back in a separate section of the DVD.  The moves are fun and challenging enough to get you sweating, however you need to do all of the routines about 3 times through to get a decent cardio workout - but it's fun, a good burn.  I love the movie, and this was a gift from my husband because he knows I love to dance.  It is definitely a cute tribute to the movie - not the best workout DVD I own, but it's a fun alternative to just getting on the elliptical.",1265587200,9,842,3.982142857142857

3617884,3,B001GP5TKY,"Pros:
Great production, stage, lighting, sound
Good choice of dance moves
Tracy Mallet has great cueing & tries to be energetic
Music in the short dance mode is the real thing
8 backup dancers
Breaking up the instruction routine portion from the dance routine portion as well as putting all the 4 diff styles into two different big routines

Cons:
Instructional portions are way too fast, they rarely show any moves in less then 3/4 speed & only a few times before moving on
Most times on anything but basic moves, even the backup dancers don't do the moves anywhere that it's suppose to be
Barely break down moves, and spend more time teaching marches then complicated moves
Barely teach any moves 2x before putting it into the routine
Johnny doesn't know the moves in the routines he didn't teach
Once they get a routine going in the instruction portions or dance routine part, it's very sloppy forms
Cuing or transition to the next move in a routine is poor, most dancers didn't even know always.
Repetition of some moves, silly bunny hops in one routine.
Tracy & Johnny literally read from cue cards on the ""chatting"" time & seems stilted
Only does a portion of the real songs from the movie soundtrack during the 3-4 min dance routine
Music for instructional portions is a bit too bland, why couldn't they use the same songs in it's entirety?

This could have been a great dance workout dvd. But it seems they rushed the production considering the bad/stilted chatting, bad form, rushed instruction, etc. All they had to do was allow more practice for the dancers & instructors/hosts & more dance instruction.  Having one do the same move many times before moving on is a GREAT workout in itself, without needing a perfect routine. If they want to keep the heart rate up, going only 1/2 times several times & many times on normal speed is the best way. Those who know the moves can easily go full speed when half is taught.
With all the over 100 latin, hip-hop, hula, belly dance instructional/workouts I've rented/owned, I still had trouble with this except on moves I did already know & even then I was shocked on how little time they spent teaching before moving on.

3617885,5,B001GP5TKY,"I love this DVD.  I've tried ""exercise"" dance DVDs before, and the instruction parts moved so slowly that I didn't get any sort of workout at all.  Not the case here. The instruction keeps you constantly moving, giving you a good workout, but is done in a way that makes it rather easy to learn. There are a few steps that are tricky, but most steps are easy to master. A previous reviewer commented that the time listed for each routine was misleading - the time is for the instruction; not the actual dance.  The instruction for each routine is 11-14 minutes, while the completed routines are 3-4 minutes each.  I love dancing, and this is so fun that I completely forget I'm exercising.

3617927,4,B001GP5TKY,"I've only done this workout once so far; so you can see my commitment to exercise. However, when I did it I thought it was a lot of fun.  It's a little difficult to follow, and you need space.  I think with practice it'll be easier.  Definitely a fun activity.",1234828800,4,260,4.16
3617928,5,B001GP5TKY,"First of all I'm a huge fan of Dirty Dancing and the video did not let me down. The music is so amazing and the dances are fun to learn, what more could you ask for?
I found Tracey Mallett as always a perfect cuer and a delight to workout with. The dances are easy to follow some harder than other's. YES was probably the hardest but get's your heart pumping. My favorite was Jonnies Mambo and Do You Love Me....I love the snake move!
This video is worth the money for entertainment and a good workout!!

If found the workouts true to the timing advertised.",1234051200,3,557,4.254716981132075
3617929,5,B001GP5TKY,"I just got this workout video and its sooo much fun!  I love Dirty Dancing and would love to dance like on the movie so I bought this.  I'm not athletic and don't do many workout videos but I think this one explains the moves well, but not to the point where I'm bored.  Its pretty challenging!  I think I could actually keep doing this video until I get it right and not get sick of it.",1233532800,3,387,3.987012987012987

8306492,3,B001GP5TKY,So funny. This was more of a gag gift than a work out video. It does teach you minor dance moves and uses music from the movie. As expected. Fun and Comical in a good way.,1523145600,,171,3.7777777777777777

8306495,4,B001GP5TKY,I like the dance routines. They go over the dance steps fast yet I do fine since I have taken dance classes before. Love the movie and music. This was reasonably priced for DVD. I think I paid $5.,1497830400,,196,4.051282051282051

It was completely useless to me but because I had ripped off the copious packaging, I didn't feel I could return it. I'm sure it's a very good dvd but I'd have to see it to believe it! It would be good if it were made clearer about different codes and zones.",1471737600,,335,4.090909090909091
