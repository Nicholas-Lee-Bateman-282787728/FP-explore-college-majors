2999694,5,B000XA5K0C,"I used this for homeschooling my 10 and 11 year old. It absolutely held their interest and was incredibly informative, although there were a couple of scenes during which they felt the need to cover their eyes. (Just graphic, not inappropriate) Reproduction was tastefully presented and there was no need to fast-forward! I believe I learned at least as much as they did although I have been an RN for 16 years- Very well done, entertaining, some humorous sections, some very touching.  My five year old attempted to watch it, though, and was quickly running out of the room because it was too ""disgusting"".",1207699200,35,607,4.836538461538462
2999695,5,B000XA5K0C,This DVD is a great teaching tool. I use it at the Community College for an Introduction to Anatomy & Physiology class. The students love it. They learn without realizing. I like that the format is divided into body systems. It would have helped me:(1)to know before purchase that the DVD is 100 min. (too long for 1 class) and (2) to have an insert in the DVD case that gives times for the various systems covered. My preview at home accomplished those 2 purposes.,1202515200,73,465,4.482352941176471
2999725,5,B000XA5K0C,"Love this DVD.  It's very informative and entertaining at the same time.  It's broken into sections, so that makes it easy to stop and return to later.  The photography is amazing.",1420675200,,180,4.741935483870968

2999730,4,B000XA5K0C,"This is a very good Dvd on the human body but I like the Incredible Human Body version narrated by EG Marshall better.  That version sort of romanticizes the human body and that is what we need more of as for some people their bodies get severely neglected throughout life.  I found an novel titled Vile Bodies, 1930ish.  I'm sure it has created some of the issues many of us face with our body image.  Both of these videos and the Discovery Channel video titled The Human Body, Pushing the Limits, are great for improving one's thinking about our bodies.  My choice of the three would be The Incredible Human Body since we aren't machines and this video neglects our emotional life and the brain itself.  Incredible Human Body doesn't mention the brain either but there are lots of videos out there on the brain.  Nat Geo or Discovery offers an excellent 3 hour VHS on the human brain and detailed info on how our brains work.",1406160000,4,927,4.514970059880239

2999733,5,B000XA5K0C,"I bought this for my Biology classroom. The kids love it and it is filled with a ton of awesome information.
If you like the human body or are teaching about it, you should probably pick this up.",1402012800,,195,4.157894736842105

2999755,5,B000XA5K0C,"Great DVD, very informative, and interesting.  This video goes over everything about the human body, in a swift and fast time.

2999759,5,B000XA5K0C,the video covers different aspect of the human body systems with current applications in technology.  It was worth the price,1370131200,,124,5.2
2999760,4,B000XA5K0C,"My husband and I really enjoyed the movie.  However, we decided against showing it to our 6 year old grandson until he is a little older.  It was totally appropriate.  We just didn't think it was at his level.  It seems more for adults and/or adolescents.  Great movie!!!",1365638400,,271,4.5625

I understand paying for the shipping but to charge $20 for a restocking fee ... that is ridiculous! It arrived in a home-made saran wrap covering to begin with and was likely sold as new but probably ""used"" to begin with. Bad company! *spank*",1338681600,,497,4.354838709677419
2999763,5,B000XA5K0C,"What a wonderful book. I fell in love with Anatomy when I looked at the pictures of this book. So beautiful and breath taking. One can really see and understand the various electrochemical working of the body.
I use it daily as a research source for my writing and my next book. I learned so much about the inner ear. My physician tried to explain to me how the semi circular canals look like but until I saw it in a picture, I did not get it.
This book is a pleasure to own and use.

2999785,2,B000XA5K0C,"Excellent science and videography; not-so-excellent content for children.

We checked this DVD out from our local library, trusting that it would be safe for our boys to view.  After previewing the first few minutes, my husband and I both felt that it was inappropriate to show to our young boys.

We are fairly choosy when it comes to what we will allow to pass on the screen before our children, and as Christians, we did not feel like this passed the test of ""whatsoever things are pure, lovely, and of good report"".

I rated the DVD 2 stars, because the science and videography is very good, but could go no higher because of the many scenes which we felt like we would have to filter out in order for it to be safe to watch.

I would caution homeschoolers and Christians who are concerned about purity and protecting your children's innocence, to carefully preview this before viewing with your whole family.  We opted to just not watch it as a family, and will seek for a more Christian perspective, such as the Moody Science DVDs.

If you have no problem with your kids seeing a lot of skin, then this may be the video for you!  There were many good things to be said about the DVD, which other reviewers have pointed out.  I just wanted to give a warning for those families who care about these kinds of things.",1288310400,13,1319,4.4625
