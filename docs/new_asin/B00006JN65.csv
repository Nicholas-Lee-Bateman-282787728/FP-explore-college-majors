7970441,4,B00006JN65,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a veteran and do not have an extensive knowledge of submarines.  I bought this video for a friend, who did serve on submarines during the cold war and during the Korean and Vietnam wars.  I decided to purchase this video as a gift for him after I saw the documentary on the Military History Channel.  As someone with very limited knowledge of the submarine or submarine warfare, I was fascinated with the submarine's origins and its importance throughout history.  I thought that it was a wonderful tribute for all those special sailors who served on these deadly submersible ships.  It is my understanding, however, that there is a lot more that has yet to be revealed regarding their missions, as many of the operations have probably not yet been declassified.  My former submariner friend was miffed that there was no mention of any diesel powered submarines that served during the cold war.  Aside from his comment, and with the understanding that some information should not be included due to national security concerns, I felt that this program was very informative, especially to those unfamiliar with submarine operations.  I rate this video at four and one-half (4 1/2) stars.",1378252800,,1237,4.885167464114833
