8402368,1,B003QO8THS,"1/4 STAR for being able to film a movie.
I usually get something out of a slow paced independent movie...BUT come on, really. This was like watching a very boring sleep walker.",1435276800,,176,4.53125
8402369,1,B003QO8THS,"What a stupid movie. You wait the whole movie for it to have a purpose and it just ends with no resolve. I mean, you can let your imagination create the story of course but it was really just lame. A waste of time.",1433721600,,214,3.8863636363636362

8402376,5,B003QO8THS,"This movie is fantastic.  It used to have numerous positive reviews, but they seem to have vanished since the DVD was rereleased.

A teenaged girl named Joy has gone missing on the day before her eighteenth birthday.  But this is not a mystery about a missing girl, it is not a police drama, and you will not find out what happened to Joy.  Helen is a girl from Joy's class who has led a completely different life from her classmate.  She is selected to play Joy in a police re-creation of the day's events.

This film is slow-moving and the camerawork is very peaceful and float-y.  If you are not interested in a character study about youth and identity, you probably won't enjoy it, there is practically no action to the whole film.  (Also the British accents may be hard to understand for some people.)  But this is exactly what I look for in a movie, and I am very much looking forward to the 2013 followup from directors Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor (not yet released in the US, unfortunately).",1397865600,9,1003,4.497237569060774
