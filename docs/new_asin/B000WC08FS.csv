8222391,5,B000WC08FS,"I usually don't write reviews unless the product sucks. I felt like I had to write one for this DVD. I honestly thought ok, I'll spend 50 bucks, give it one more try. To my surprise the DVD was very good. I had not idea that you supposed to warm up for splits, I always thought that splits was the warm up. Many exercise I never seen before. The 20% of the DVD that I seen before, I did not know how to do right. So it's 50 bucks well spent. I ordered more from this author and will continue to do so.",1340668800,5,501,3.8737864077669903
8222392,1,B000WC08FS,If you aren't already flexible don't bother getting these DVDs. It gives no modified versions of the exercises to get you limber and is pretty much just a guy going through his contortions. Gives no instructions of real use. If you want to get limber go somewhere else. These don't do it and you could get hurt.,1231804800,8,311,4.473684210526316
8222393,3,B000WC08FS,"Basically, for two hours, this guy tells you how to stretch to do splits.  He doesn't show you the progression of the splits or anything like that.  For two hours, you see 12 chapters of stretching and then you see a chapter on how to massage yourself with castor oil to loosen the muscles for the stretch.  He doesn't even wear shorts to massage himself with the oil.  He just states: ""put some oil in your hands and then knead like this, or move your thumbs like this.""

A rational human being would have done the stretches and then shown the splits.  This guy just does the stretches.  You probably are asking what types of stretches: The same type of stretches you do at your exercise class or at yoga class.  Calve stretch, ankle twist, shoulder twist, lower back stretches, quad stretches and so forth.  Just to give you an idea of how this DVD is a waste of money:

Intro: Full body stretch
Chapter I: Light Stretches
Chapter II: Stretches you can follow along to
Chapter III: Posture
Chapter IV: Static Conditioning Stretches
Chapter V: Dynamic Conditioning Stretches
Chapter VI: Upper Body Stretches
Chapter VII: Split Specific Warmup (don't get excited; this is just more stretches)
Chapter VIII: Extended Length Conditioning
Chapter IX: Deep Stretches
Chapter X: Massage

My chapters are numbered differently, but there are 12 chapters of STRETCHING, yes, STRETCHING.  I would not advise anyone to waste their money on this DVD.  In addition, it is not set to music.  The guy is just sitting in a gym area doing stretches.

Edited to add: Stretching for dummies has the same stretches and is great at explaining how the stretches increase flexibility.  The book also only costs about 17.00 (so save yourself some money).

Edited to add: here is the guy on utube---type the regular youtube address and add this to the link address /watch?v=1NBkbLJlk08",1207008000,35,1861,4.82018927444795
8222394,5,B000WC08FS,"I don't usually write reviews, but reading the previous reviewers comments, made me very upset, because he/she clearly misunderstood what ElasticSteel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everything-You-Ever-Wanted-To-Know-About-SPLITS-FLEXIBILITY-DVD/dp/B000WC08FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About SPLITS & FLEXIBILITY DVD</a>&nbsp;is all about. I have gotten this DVD a while ago, and have practiced everything that Paul teaches on this video, and I must say that it is amazing! I started concentrating only on my side split for about the first 3 or so weeks, and when before i was in terrible pain while trying to do splits now after going through the whole routine for side split including massaging with the castor oil, I felt that my pain was gone! Moreover I was able to almost sit in a split, comfortably, and I'm going to repeat myself, PAIN FREE! As for the reson the previous reviewers comments, perhaps he's just gotten overwhelmed, because unlike all of the other time wasters out there, that put together a long video and fill it with boring talk about unrelated topics. Paul Zaichik, gives you  A LOT of information, non-stop for 2 hours! As for so many stretches and splits in a video, the reason they are there is because it's a FOLLOW ALONG, video, that gives you variations and teaches you how to do splits! If i'd recommend only 1 dvd on this topic, THIS would be it!",1199836800,32,1460,5.3755458515283845
8222395,1,B000WC08FS,"This was definitely a waste of my money. While the title states ""Splits & Flexibility"", if I had known it was simply watching somebody who already can do the splits (i.e. shows no progression of how he got there) over and over again, I never would have bought it. This is nothing more than a video of a guy who set up a camera in his studio and taped himself doing a two-hour stretch routine. There is no explanation as to why, as his advertising claims, his ""Secret Flexibility"" knowledge is superior to others. I see no ""secret"" to reaching the splits... he simply shows a few stretches that anyone can do (and anyone who has had fourth grade gym class already knows how to do) and then he goes into doing stretches that nobody could do unless they were already flexible enough to do the splits. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT. I'm sorry I did, and am only writing this because some other Amazon users have helped me save money in the past. Buyer beware!",1197590400,59,954,4.395480225988701
