8055366,5,B00081QEO2,"Something clearly is going on with the product description here which has nothing to do with the DVD set itself. Not that I'm complaining. I bought this because I was very happy with the Ohio DVD in the same series and wanted to learn  more about the midwest. This DVD delivered with some of the most breathtaking vistas I've ever seen and really gives a great overview of the American heartland. That doesn't explain why the sales page talks about electric lights, but since I got what I wanted I'm giving it five stars.",1153440000,2,521,4.542553191489362
