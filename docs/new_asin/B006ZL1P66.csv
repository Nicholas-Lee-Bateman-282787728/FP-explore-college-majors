5042913,2,B006ZL1P66,"I keep thinking to myself that someone, someday in Hollywood will have a truly genuine, ingenious, original idea for the next great horror movie. And although I know that sequels, especially when numbered past 2 or 3 are not original in any form, my faith in Pinhead as an iconic horror fixture was such that I believed some up & coming visionary director would be a fan of the original Hellraiser & make at least one of these sequels entertaining. God I hate being wrong. Even to myself. Bloodline is a descent movie and I would be lying if I said I didn't love the new Cynabites. But that's where my admiration dies a slow, agonizing death. I enjoyed the quirkiness of Christopher Walkens as Gabriel in the first Prophecy, but fellow horror movie fans & readers of this in general, save your precious time. Forget the money issue. I spent a little over $4 for 11 movies with small minded thinking, ""it's worth that amount at least!"" Wrong again..psst, I'm a woman. This phrase is almost impossible to say & I only admit it in the hopes of helping my fellow horror fans of making the mistake of wasting valuable time. Life is too short & time is much too precious to waste on this much garbage. Two of these movies are worth watching. The rest? I can't in good faith even recommend them as fillers, cheesy B movies with one liners you can make fun of with ur friends or gore-vision. I would have rather spent my time cleaning out cat litter boxes or sitting in my dentists office. Yes, they are that bad. Heed my warning fellow fans, once time is spent, it is exhausted & gone forever. Don't waste any of it on meaningless, plotless, joyless menagerie trash such as this. We must rebel against the Hollywood machine that continues to manufacture this insane garbage",1365206400,5,1766,4.539184952978056

5042915,3,B006ZL1P66,"Hellraiser installements were pretty drawn out wiht no plot really, but did the best to keep watching them. The prophecy movies were kind of instresting and some were the basis for the start of some of today's well known actors and actresses.",1361059200,,242,4.785714285714286

5042917,5,B006ZL1P66,Christopher Walken & Mickey Rourke are two of the best actors ever (Rourke not in this one). There are parts that could not be played by anybody else but these two. Both underrated. Only Walken could have done the sceen in Pulp Fiction about the father that was a prisoner of war and kept shoving his watch up his butt to keep for his son to have. Only Rourke could have done the great job in Barfly and Sin City.,1359936000,,413,4.175
5042918,5,B006ZL1P66,"11 Movies in one case ( The Prophecy 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ) are all on one disc. ( Hellraiser 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ) are on 2 discs one is two sided, sadly Hellraiser 1 and 2 are not part of the set but that's ok. I bought the used ones ones they are excellent I'm very happy with the picture, color, and sound all very clear, and arrived in the mail in perfect condition. The reason I am not saying much about them in the review is because other reviews have already given tons of info about it which is the one of the reasons I bought them. But I will sat this I am in horror movie heaven",1358121600,5,585,3.6507936507936507

5042920,4,B006ZL1P66,"Being a fan of Hellraiser, I was very excited to buy this, and having 5 more movies, was a plus. Never seen any Prophecy films, but I tought this was a very good buy. 11 films for $10. That's less than $1 per film. There are no special features. It's just the movie. Just a ""Play & Chapters"" menu. It comes in a 4 disc set.

5042922,1,B006ZL1P66,"I purchased this product at walmart and once home opened it to discover that it contained three discs: The first disc contained all 5 Prophecy films, the second disc was a two sided disc that had the first 3 Prophecy films on it, and the third disc had Hellraiser 6, 7, and 8. I returned to walmart to exchange it, and opened the exchanged one at the customer service desk to find that it contained the same discs. Unable to obtain Hellraisers 3-5, I accepted a refund. It is possible only a small number were mispackaged, but I thought people might want to know of the risk when purchasing this collection. If Miramax ever addresses this and releases a corrected collection I would gladly purchase it.",1349308800,5,702,4.579365079365079

5042940,2,B006ZL1P66,"I ordered this being a Huge Hellraiser fan and already having 1 and 2 on DVD. So why not get the other 6 and The 5 Prophecy films was just a plus for the price. Well got it in the mail today Jan 21,2015 and I was hugely dissapointed. Its says 3 Discs in the product description and thats what I got. The Prophecy 1&2 on one disc with part 3 being on the flip side of part 1&2. The 2nd disc being Prophecy 4&5 on one disc no flip side. The biggest dissapoinment was the 3rd Disc being Hellraiser 6,7,&8 no flip side on that either. So I recieved no copy of Hellraiser 3,4,or5. I asked for a refund but have already ordered Hellraiser 3,4,&5 in a three disc set off Amazon. If you just want the Prophecy movies its an ok deal but don't advertise an 11 movie set and only send 8. This isn't a review of the Pinhead movies as they all are awesome (excluding Hellword IMO). Just trying to save someone from getting burned because Hellraiser 3 and 4 are great additions to the series but not there. SHAME ON YOU MIRAMAX.",1421798400,8,1014,4.152284263959391

5042958,5,B006ZL1P66,"I love the movies because I can look at it from a different point of view from a illuminati (mason) angle. the only thing I don't like about the prophecy is that the writer is saying that the angels are mad at god and that they don't won't to help us and they are made to by god and all this rebellion and he have cast Lucifer for punishment its a lie. for one angles was made to a job and that's what they do.i work with them every day they will help you and they all praise god. but you have to put effort and don't waste there time.and they tell me all the time god is love and everybody work together even Lucifer is covers light and dark and wisdom. and it was not pride that got him kick out of heaven. on his pictures I is proud of that god made him that way. think about this if god says I am the beginning and end and created all of this. but don't have control of what he made and created don't make sense and he would not be god? and why would satan try o fight god when he know he will lose and satan is god right hand man. and satan and Lucifer are not the same. and there is no jesus , jesus is a Spanish god son name is  yeshua  that is a jewish name. the j didn't come into the alphabet until the 1500 s. how are you going to have the king of the jews with a latin name? stop letting illuminati sell you a false dream. but other than the fairy tales its a lot of good movie and I learned a lot, to compare other prophecy and hellraiser  movies it met my expectations and more because it taught to see the truth.  so please watch it so you would learn and not to be fooled!!! if I have offended anyone I am sorry and we all have a right to to believe what we want to believe. and I do love my illuminati family!! but I have to speak the truth!! p.s I love hellrasier its masonic and that to be in the illuminati  you have to give your soul or others to get your dreams

  thanks for reading my review!!!",1408752000,,1918,3.875

5042978,5,B006ZL1P66,"This is a great collection of movies. And for the price, you just can't beat it. 11 movies on 3 discs (plus 3 more features). The picture quality was pretty good too. Up until now I had never seen any of the Prophecy movies and I pretty much enjoyed them all. Very entertaining little features they are.

As for the Hellraiser films, I had seen the first 2 movies years ago and enjoyed them enough, but I was really surprised with how much I liked the rest of the movies in the series. Especially with the films that were released straight-to-video such as Inferno, Hellseeker, and Hellworld. I will definitely be revisiting all of these films again somewhere down the road.

If you are thinking about purchasing this set, all I can say is, grab this collection now while you still can.",1390348800,2,786,4.528169014084507
5042979,5,B006ZL1P66,"This review is for the collection and not the movies, which vary in quality.

This set comes with the Prophecy movies (I - IV) and the Hellraiser sequels (III - VIII). So basically you get 11 movies for a low price which is what attracted me to this item.

If you are fans of any of these film series, or both, this is a terrific buy. I got it mostly for the Hellraiser films since I have both the original and the first sequel and wanted to complete the series. The films are presented within 4 DVDs. For instance, the Hellraiser films are presented within 2 DVDs, chapter III: Hell on Earth and IV: Bloodline is presented on the first side of a double-sided DVD, with Hellraiser V: Inferno presented on the other side. The other sequels  Hellraiser VI: Hellseeker, VII: Deader and VIII: Hellworld are presented on another DVD (single side). The Prophecy films are presented in a similar format.

Do not expect any extras thrown in here as the films are presented bare-bones and not even the trailers are included. I did not find any problems with the picture quality or sound so no major complaints here.

If you are content with just the films, you should have no problems with the set. If you want something more comprehensive with a little more added embellishments, than I suggest you track out the films individually however I am not too sure many of these films have been released in mind-blowing comprehensive DVD/BluRay versions so you may be searching in vain.

For the price, this set is recommended for fans of either series and to the horror film fan.",1388707200,2,1565,4.591397849462366

5042981,5,B006ZL1P66,"Although I previously bought the 6 disc Helraiser collection, I purchased this because of the inclusion of the 5 Prophecy movies ( plus the six Hellraiser collection I owned previously is badly damaged).

I'd never seen the Prophecy movies prior to this purchase and was very thrilled by them. It amazes me that now in this day and age that the original movie could spawn 4 sequels ( remember Warlock ). The Prophecy movies, like the Hellraiser movies are more fluid franchises, because they can take place outside a confined location (  Jason Voorhees and Crystal Lake; Michael Myers and Haddonfield are confined local settings).

I was always into the hack and slash aspect of horror, the maniacal menaces armed with Butchers Knife or Machete and not renegade angels wanting to bring about Armageddon or the pleasures that await us in ""Hell"".

I was happy when I saw this set.  I like both of these movies and they are together.  I got hooked on Hellraiser on TV but they only showed I think Inferno and the last one over and over.  They are a lot of movies for a little price.  I don't like having to flip the DVD, I like single DVDS, but that's just me being picky.  If you love the first two Hellraisers they also come in a set so with that set you can have them all and get the bonus of Christopher Walken!  I've never seen the other Prophesy movies, but I am looking forward to them.  Right now I'm watching the Hellraisers over :).",1376524800,3,768,3.9607843137254903
