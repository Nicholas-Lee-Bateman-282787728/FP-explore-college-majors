8252120,4,B0013MBPK8,"Admittedly, I know very little about Catch Wrestling to begin with.  I know not whether he's better than other teachers out there; however, from a novice perspective watching the videos (and I've only seen the first one so far), he seems to REALLY know what he's talking about!  He goes into great detail.  Its almost hard to watch because it seems like his ""partner"" is in almost constant pain, so that part sucks.  If I need to revise after watching the rest of them, I will, but based off this first disk, it would be hard to fathom how someone could be much better than Tony.  Sure, Billy Robinson is cream of the crop, and all those on his team are great, but this guy is really good too, and I wouldn't miss out on this teaching if I were you.",1369785600,2,749,4.283687943262412
8252121,5,B0013MBPK8,"A slight alteration in the way you grasp an opponent can make a world of difference in the amount of pain or control you can create on them.
These DVDs will improve your ground game immensely.
You've probably already studied BJJ if you are looking at and thinking about buying these videos.
Trust me, they will give you advanced knowledge that will take your locks to whole other level.
There are a lot of things I like about how he shows them, but one of the main things is that he doesn't keep going over the same hold over and over and over wasting time.
It sometimes seems the bigger the name of the BJJ guy the less they actually show.  They seem to enjoy little dribs and dabs of info never considering that you have a rewind button if you want to see it again.
But moving on, don't worry about if somebody has puffed up their past to make themselves bigger than they were back in the day.
All you should care about is if what you are paying for is going to make you a better fighter.
Whether you are a bouncer needing to occasionally control a rowdy customer or just a guy wanting to be able to fight on the floor if you end up there, these DVDs will help you out.",1365292800,4,1171,4.18141592920354
8252122,1,B0013MBPK8,"Phony Cecchine considers himself a legend. Here's what you'll get in this here DVD set.
1) Phony Cecchine considers all these wrist locks a ""lost art"", and ""hooking"".
2) He'll keep on putting down Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, but most of these moves are BJJ. Later on he'll show a BJJ Armlock!
3) On the back of this DVD artwork, he'll make it sound like he's been a life-long studen of Lou Thesz. On the internet he claims all sorts of stuff. He lies so much he can't keep up with it AT ALL.
4) Phony Cecchine is just ""hooking"" some big fat guy who calls himself ""Bruce Lee"".
There's a good reason NOBODY has ever heard of this guy. He's NEVER had a MMA fight, but convinced himself he's a legend. He has no experience in the octagon but thinks/claims he can beat anybody. He's like 5 feet tall, this guy doesn't pose much of a threat. He's talking for HOURS and HOURS not showing any ""hooking"". Just giving history lessons. This guy's a fraud, try looking up 1 fight he's had. You won't find ANY. There's a whole lot of commercial videos out there by Pro Fighters. This is rubbish. Your wasting money and like 10 hours of hearing this guido talk. **Please don't waste your time or money on this fraud.
Buy a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu book written by someone with experience. ""Pankration"" I don't think so.",1261094400,,1293,4.414225941422594
8252123,5,B0013MBPK8,"this is the best i've ever seen in technique and detail , i see where i made a ton of mistake in the past thinking i could wrestle after watching this i found how little i really knew . thank God for this dvd",1228521600,4,208,3.75
8252124,5,B0013MBPK8,"this is an excellent grappling instructional, there isn't really anaything revolutionary on these dvds. but it gives an alternative viewon how to approach submisson wrestling and gives an altrenative view on some the basic grappling concepts (entrys into leg locks, keylocks,scarfhold, the step over,chauncery, and the infamous head scissors).
there is alot of B.S. that gets tthrown on tony cecchine's name. Dont let that distract from getting a very solid product that will help you improve your basic game. this product has has helped me improve my leg locks and my top game. i recommend this to anybody that is a grappling/catch as catch can enthusiast.",1226880000,7,657,5.2075471698113205
8252125,5,B0013MBPK8,"First, let me note that this is in fact a 5-DVD set, covering ten volumes, with different cover art than that shown here.

If you are interested in submission grappling, Cecchine's Lost Art of Hooking is one of the best purchases you can make.  He is clear and thorough in his explanations, and he covers in detail some basics not generally found in other submission grappling sets (such as weight distribution for controlling an opponent).

With Brazilian Jiu Jitsu the default ground game for mixed martial arts today, learning a different approach on the ground (personally, I cross train catch and BJJ, with catch as my base) will give you not only an immediate competitive edge (most BJJ guys, for instance, aren't expecting you to launch a leg lock from inside their guard), but also a larger base of knowledge from which to draw as you put together your own unique ground game.

One of the biggest strengths of the set -- in addition to covering leg locks in a way you simply won't find anywhere else save, say, Russian sambo instructionals -- is Cecchine's attention to detail:  it is the nuances that turn submission attempts into submissions, and often times the difference between getting the submission or not is as simple as positioning your blade successfully, or twisting the wrist, or levering out rather than back.  Cecchine shows you plenty of that, and in doing so will help you make your submission holds that much better.  In catch wrestling, submission holds -- or ""hooks"" -- are intended to break, tear, and maim.  So while these holds can certainly be adapted to pure sport fighting, Cecchine also shows how, with the proper finish, they can be used to brutal effect outside of competitive venues.

An excellent companion set to Drysdale's Nth Dimension (BJJ), Ribeiro's Freestyle Revolution (BJJ), Yakimov's Leg Lock set (Sambo), Rutten's Big DVDs of Combat (general mma), Mark Schultz's set (amateur wrestling and mma), and Bravo's Mastering the Rubber Guard (whatever it is that Bravo is calling his stuff these days).  I've also heard nice things about Josh Barnett's ""Attacking the Guard,"" but I've yet to see that.",1208736000,12,2144,4.930555555555555
