557162,4,6303082769,"One of the reasons that ""X - The Man With the X-Ray Eyes"" looks half-way decent in Ray Milland's film career is that when he started his spectacular drop from winning the Oscar for his performance in 1945's ""The Lost Weekend"" he was still almost a decade away from making ""The Thing With Two Heads.""  I always figured this 1963 film from director Roger Corman was inspired by the infamous add for X-Ray specs that appeared inside the front cover of virtually every comic book produced when I was a kid.  However, the screen play is credited to Robert Dillon (""Muscle Beach Party,"" ""French Connection II"") and Ray Russell (""Mr. Sardonicus""), based on a story by Russell.  The plot is as simple as the ad: Dr. James Xavier (Milland), is a world famous scientist who is experimenting with human eyesight and develops a serum that will allow him to see fun things like ultraviolent rays and (gasp!) through objects.  Of course, this is one of those things that seems like a good idea at the time...
The film is really much more of a science fiction film than it is the traditional sort of horror film you expect from Corman, who has a script that suits his ability to bring out the weirdness in situations.  The film has remarkably little to do with voyeurism and actually more to do with the nature of reality.  It is ultimately a psychological drama, because as Xavier sees human beings reduced to their skeletons, he becomes incapable of dealing with them on a personal level.
In terms of movies where the mad scientist goes off the deep end with a god complex, this one makes the main character the victim of his own experiments (contrast this with Claude Reins in ""The Invisible Man"").  After accidentally killing a colleague, Xavier hides out in a carnival sideshow where he works as a faith healer.  Clearly his x-ray vision functions as a metaphor for the ability to have insight into the sad side of life, but, ironically, Xavier cannot see where his own life is heading.  His ""visions"" become increasingly worse until a fateful meeting with an evangelist at a revival meeting in the desert.
Although not a traditional horror or monster movie, ""X - The Man With the X-Ray Eyes"" has a sense of bleakness that becomes rather overwhelming by the end.  As always, Corman is working with a limited budget, and while this does not affect his direction, it does limit the film's effectiveness because the special effects (i.e., optical tricks) can barefly suggest the depths of Xavier's ""visions.""  However, if you get into the spirit of things you can let your imagination carry the load.  Considered by many to be Corman's masterpiece, it remains a most atypical Corman film, which makes a kind of sense.  Certainly, this has the most unforgettable ending of a Corman film.",1038614400,25,2773,4.728215767634855
557163,5,6303082769,"Even when told by a colleague that his vision is excellent, Dr. Xavier is not entirely satisfied: he wants to see what no other man has seen before. To do so and close in on the gods, he has created a substance enabling nothing short of x-ray vision; he takes one drop of it in each eye, even though a monkey he tried it on just died. Taking more of the substance, he soon begins to challenge his colleagues's medical decisions, and is forced to flee after accidentally killing one of them. In the film's first half, Dr. Xavier goes from man to semi-god to exploited freak; eventually posing as Mantallo, he becomes a `healer' who can't even heal himself. In the second half, his substance abuse gets worse: while trying to find a reversal, he uses more of it to better his chances of getting the money he needs. His voyage of self-discovery ends when he reaches a point of no return and recognizes it. This multi-layered film is rooted in a genre of fiction that we could call `the curse of the (wo)man-god', and which goes all the way back to the Greek concept of `hubris'; in such works, a human unsuccessfully tries to transcend his/her own nature through his/her specialised branch of knowledge. The most interesting of these inevitably carry theological and philosophical implications, and `X' is no exception. The way the movie highlights the different stages of the character's downfall is especially effective: everything from the music, the shapes, the colors, and the editing to Milland's acting denotes this degenerative process.",1035244800,14,1541,4.818867924528302

557166,4,6303082769,"Corman hits the nail on the head with this classic Sci-Fantasy tale.  Milland fills his role - as the doctor/scientist madly in search of the ""truth"" - perfectly.  The visual effects are quite unique as  well. Each addictive eye drop forces Milland's character to see deeper and  farther - first underneath clothes, then through tissue into the recesses  of the human body, then through slot machines and black-jack hands  (permitting him to win big at the casino), THEN through  buildings and  skyscrapers - which become ghostly objects with underlying steel girders  being the only discernible objects.  Finally, circumstances force the  out-of-control Milland to confront the endgame of his experiment and his  unintended goal: to see the ultimate truth - the overwhelming, blazing face  of God himself.  His method of escaping the piercing light is obvious yet  still provides a jarringly satisfying ending to this wonderfully direct and  ironic film.",927158400,6,955,5.308724832214765
557297,5,6303082769,"As reviewed on my website[...]

Minted from a newly created (in 2014) HD transfer from MGM, Kino's Blu-ray of ""X"" is terrific. The picture quality (reproducing the original widescreen 1.85  theatrical ratio correctly) is solid, with only a few minor instances of dirt and debris cropping up - mostly in the optical effects and scene transitions - but never enough to detract from the film. Film grain appears to be well rendered with no visible artifacts that would indicate that overzealous digital processing was used. The two channel mono sound is flagged correctly to make capable audio processors automatically decode and route it properly to a single center channel speaker. Frequency extremes are somewhat limited, which is to be expected given the low budget nature of the film, and there is a trace of sound distortion in the early going that clears up. MGM must have quality elements on hand and did an excellent job preparing this master for Kino.

The Blu-ray has decent supply of extras on-hand: the theatrical trailer (and just what does ""Filmed in Spectarama"" mean, anyway?), a ""Trailers from Hell"" segment with Mick Garris, a spoiler-laden introduction from Joe Dante (to Kino's credit, there's a text screen warning the uninitiated to not watch it until after seeing the film), and two optional audio commentaries: one by Roger Corman (from MGM's DVD release in 2001) and a newly-recorded one by writer/publisher Tim Lucas. Also included is the rarely seen 5 minute prologue that was added to the initial TV prints to pad the short running time. Contrary to what's been in written in some reviews, the prologue was only for the television viewings and was not shown theatrically.",1460246400,4,1696,5.02846975088968
557298,5,6303082769,"Dr. Xavier (Ray Milland) gets his eyes tested and bemoans the fact that he doesnt see as much as he wants to (craving better sight or greater insight).  As with all mad scientists, Dr. Xavier will insist on delving into matters beyond his scope of understanding, with disastrous results.  Once he starts experimenting on himself with his magic eye drops he cant stop, yearning for more.  He assaults another doctor with a scalpel and finds himself threatened with a malpractice suit.  Soon, hes forced to go on the run, eventually hiding out in a carnival where a disreputable Barker (Don Rickles as Crane) seeks to use his talents for monetary gain.

Ray Milland manages to infuse his character with a great measure of sympathy.  Even after a few grievous acts, you can still feel sorry for the poor sod who just wanted to see more than he should.  As far as intentions go, he wanted this ability to help improve the medical profession.  But then he ended up in Vegas and became quite adept at reading cards.  Proving he wasn't entirely altruistic.

Based on a story by Ray Russell (who also wrote the script), Corman delivers a terrific experience with the help of a strong lead performance from Ray Milland, and some very interesting photographic effects. This is one film that I am curious to see remade with the technology of today. Kino's blu-ray is not Criterion / Arrow level but provides a decent transfer of a print in reasonable good shape.

Moderation in all things. What happens if you get too much of a good thing?

Dr. James Xavier finds out what it is like going beyond underwear. And into the mysteries of life. His creation of drops that let you see on a new plane can be dangerous. The more he drops the more he sees.

557351,5,6303082769,"Ray Milland starring in the cerebral ""X: The Man With the X-Ray Eyes"" is one of my all-time favorite Roger Corman films. And that's saying a lot considering that I like a vast amount of Corman's work.

I remember sitting in a theater as a kid on the edge of my seat watching ""X: The Man With the X-Ray Eyes"" when it was first released in 1963. A well-seasoned Ray Milland was towering on the big screen with his watery eyes at first looking through the clothes of young party-goers doing the twist; and later into chest cavities with pounding hearts; and then through brick walls; and finally into the far reaches of the universe.

Milland's beautiful scientist girlfriend, wonderfully played by Diana Van der Vlis, does her best to convince him to stop his unorthodox self-experimentation, but ultimately fails when Milland accidentally kills his doctor friend. Refusing to give up, she pursues Milland, who has gone into hiding, throughout the rest of the film.

Pardon the pun, but I want to focus on this new Kino Lorber blu-ray release. As blu-ray releases go, it has a crisp, sharp picture with vibrant colors and excellent sound. No scratches or dirt specks in the film, no visible splices or repair work. I would say it is a near-perfect blu-ray presentation.

And some past releases of ""X"" have been pretty darn good, too. I own the MGM ""Midnight Movies"" release from 2001 and the MGM 2007 DVD box set ""The Roger Corman Collection"" which has ""X"" and ""The Premature Burial"" on a double-sided disc. Both of these versions also have excellent pictures and sound.

The special features on the new blu-ray release are very good, although most are short (except for the two separate commentary tracks by the great man himself Roger Corman and film historian Tim Lucas). The unused prologue to the movie is like watching a classroom science film and pretty boring. No wonder it was cut from the film. However, director Joe Dante's memories and reflections about ""X"" are entertaining and way too short.

If you love vintage, low budget, and often thought-provoking Corman films (and who doesn't?), then I highly recommend this Kino Lorber blu-ray edition of ""X: The Man With the X-Ray Eyes.""",1432166400,21,2192,4.816489361702128

Diana Van der Vlis plays his disciple while Don Rickles is on hand as a carnival barker.

The early 60s vibe is to die for, but the beginning is rather dull. Things perk up at an adult party where the aging doctor tries to keep hip and eventually sees everyone nakkid (lol). The carnival sequence and what it leads into are arguably the best parts, although the Vegas and tent revival episodes have their attractions. The movie scores meh on the female front, but Lorrie Summers and Cathie Merchant have small parts.

Original Trailer

PLOT/SUMMARY: Dr. Xavier (Ray Milland) invents a formula that enhances a person's vision. Xavier tests the formula using eye drops on a monkey. The money shows ability to see through cards but the monkey dies. Dr. Diane Fairfax works for the Foundation that is funding Xavier's experiments. They cut off funding because they are not seeing enough progress.
He discovers that he can see through clothing and can see the insides of people. Shortly thereafter he saves the life of a woman who has been misdiagnosed by the chief surgeon of a hospital. Xavier's arrogance grows steadily. He then accidentally kills his best friend by pushing him out a window. Xavier goes on the run.

Xavier, takes a job in a carnival as 'Mentallo, The Man Who Sees All'. Crane, the carnival barker who hires Xavier, realizes that Xavier has 'real' ability. He convinces him to go work in an office where he diagnoses people's ills. This venture is very successful. Diane Fairfax, soon catches on to what is going on and goes to seek out Xavier. Crane is becoming increasingly greedy and Diane is able to pull him away. Xavier is having severe problems. He can't sleep anymore. His eyelids aren't enough to prevent him from seeing through them.

Next stop Vegas to raise money. Xavier can see through cards and eventually gets kicked out of the casino he is playing in. Xavier steals a car and heads out where he is chased by the police. He ends up at a tent out in the desert where a revival is taking place. The minister says to Xavier, ""If thine eye offend's thee, then pluck it out!""

PRODUCTION/COMMENTS: This is an excellent movie and one of the best 1960's science fiction movies.

'X' was shot with a budget of $300,000 in about 3 weeks.

Initially Roger Corman, did not want to shoot this movie. He felt that there were too many special effects needed and that he wouldn't be able to make the effects look convincing on a tight budget. He managed to pull it off anyway. The effects were a lot better than expected for the period.

Rumor has it that originally at the end of the movie, Xavier says ""I can still see."" There is some evidence that it might be true. Stephen King seems to think this is the case.

Morris Ankrum makes his last appearance in this movie. Ankrum was a character actor who played roles in many science fiction movies. Typically he played a general or military officer but not always. Some of the sci-fi classics he was in are, Rocketship X-M, Flight to Mars, Invaders from Mars, Earth vs. Flying Saucers, etc.

Don Rickles plays an uncharacteristic non-comededic role as the carnival barker, Crane.

RECOMMENDATIONS: This is an excellent release and is highly recommended for all 60's science fiction
fans along with Roger Corman fans. I give the movie 4 1/2 stars. I give the extra's 5 stars and the transfer gets 5 stars.

7837057,4,6303082769,"From the opening score by Les Baxter to director Roger Cormans final shock the X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (formerly known as X) is a time capsule of the Sixties B horror genre worth every penny Corman put on screen.

Ray Milland portrays Dr. James Xavier, a man obsessed with discovering the secrets to better and clearer vision. His experiments are not to benefit mankind with better eyesight but to see past all that is hidden from the world and what lies beyond. Xavier believes that his visionary experiment will bring the medical field to a new level where doctors have the capabilities to be living x-ray machines. It is this obsession that is his downfall and his own shortsightedness that will cause his self-experimentation to go horribly wrong. Really, there isn't anything new here in the realm of mad scientist plots. They go all the way back to Mary Shellys Doctor Frankenstein. Man wants answers and will ignore the laws of both man and nature to find them, ending, as it always does, with one horrific conclusion.

In retrospect, what worked was Corman applying that story to the modern era. The Sixties were uncertain times. The United States was rediscovering itself in terms of what was acceptable or not for race, sex, and freedom. Corman walks a tightrope by showing his perception of the era and how men and women saw each other instead of focusing on his original intent, a horror film. One example of how he accomplished this is at a swinging dance party after Xavier has the ability to see them without their clothes. Another example deals with how the poor and destitute see Xavier as their savior.

Ray Milland
There are many traps that the film falls into. Xavier wants to experiment on himself after an initial success with a test animal. His colleague Dr. Sam Brant (Harold J. Stone) tries to talk him out of it for all of about two minutes then agrees to perform the experiment. Unoriginally, they have Xavier kill an innocent person and he, of course, has to be on the run. He is reduced to performing parlor tricks with his eyes to make ends meet. This enables a few plot twists, however, perhaps a shuffling of the scenes in which they were shown could have made the story less formulaic.

The ending is a bigger than expected finale, given the budget and the era of the film. Corman doesnt waste a single penny on screen and gives the audience a ride on a plot that has been done to death. The final moments are a brilliant conclusion and will leave no fan of the genre disappointed. X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes is a great cautionary tale and the perils of science and mans quest for knowledge.",1476662400,,2635,4.588110403397027

7837061,4,6303082769,"Remember those ads for X-ray glasses in comic books? No? Well you might not be old enough to remember them but I do and, at the time, thought it would be cool to be able to do something like that. I was born a skeptic so, of course, I doubted they would work but...what if they did? I never tried them out but I was enticed enough to watch ""X-The Man With The X-Ray Eyes"" when it showed on TV. In fact, I probably watched it every time it came on because it played to that childish desire to be able to have a power the average person didn't have (and of course there was the salacious aspect of the glasses as well which appealed to folks as well).

We usually can't go back to view things through children's eyes when we are adults and, as a result, some films that I loved when I was a kid just don't old up all that well. Luckily, ""X"" holds up. Yes, there are some silly parts in the film (and the science, well it was questionable even then you just have to learn to suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy the film) but, on the whole it holds up remarkably well due in no small part to Ray Milland's marvelous lead performance and the stunning support performance from  Harold J. Stone and Don Rickles.

Produced on a small budget for American International Pictures, director Roger Corman working from a script by Robert Dillon (""The Flight of the Intruder"") and Ray Russell  (""Mr. Sardonicus"") crafts an entertaining horror film that doesn't take the easy way out at the conclusion (which, as a kid, really surprised me).

Dr. Xavier (Milland) discovers a serum that can improve human sight but in unexpected ways--it gives the person using it (as eye drops) the ability to see through things. The reaction from his colleagues is, not surprising given the type of film this is, ho-hum and fails to see the potential of this discovery. So Dr. X decides to try it on himself with consequences that affects Dr. Xavier's mind as well as his vision.

The transfer for this blu-ray from Kino Lorber (I assume that Fox or MGM did the transfer for the label) looks quite nice. The film doesn't look like it went through any extensive restoration but still manages to look quite nice with robust colors, nice detail and depth. There's plenty of grain but it is managed well. There are occasional minor scratches that appear but they are precisely that--minor. Some of the optical effects result in a minor step down in image quality but, aside from that, the film looks remarkably good. To put it bluntly, this transfer (which appears to be new) blows away the one done for MGM Midnight Movies DVD version.

Audio is also quite nice--the mono presentation puts dialog front and center and I didn't detect any pops or crackles. That's not to say that the soundtrack doesn't reveal its age--it does. The score by Lex Baxter does feature some minor distortion at times but that has more to do with the recording itself rather than the presentation.

Sometimes the Kino releases will only have a trailer as an extra. ""X"" comes with some very nice special features. We get two audio commentaries--one from director Roger Corman and it's quite good. This is a carry over from the DVD. The second audio commentary by film historian Tim Lucas is both new and very entertaining with plenty of tidbits to keep listeners involved.

""Terror Vision"" features director Joe Dante on the film and, as always, it's entertaining. I keep wondering when we are going to get a deluxe version of ""Mant!"" as Dante would be entertaining in any special features.

There's a prologue that I never saw (it was cut from the film early in the release of the film) and, frankly, it's not very good and, while it might have been fine for audiences at the time, it would have harmed the film if left in. It is, however, remastered in 1080p which is a nice bonus.

We also get a ""Trailers From Hell"" segment with director Mick Garris and the original theatrical trailer.

""X:The Man With The X-Ray Eyes"" remains entertaining and has a subtext to it that allows the film to resonate beyond what I saw when I was a kid and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the film. Sometimes these films don't age as well as we do but ""X"" manages to hold its own 53 years later.
