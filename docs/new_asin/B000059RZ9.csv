1409119,5,B000059RZ9,"Basically the only thing wrong with Gunsmith Cats is that there are only 3 animated episodes.
The attention to detail in this series is phenominal. From true-to-reality actions and operation of the thousands of different types of guns, to the wonderful sounds of a real 1967 Shelby GT 500 Cobra. Not many anamation cycles here, most of the movement is actually drawn in, rather than repeated over and over again like in most anime.",1006214400,,431,4.837837837837838
1409120,5,B000059RZ9,"About five years ago, I had rented the VHS versions of Gunsmith Cats and really enjoyed the series.  I just recently bought the DVD, and it is already one of my most prized items in my anime collection!!!
This may be a series created by the Japanese, but the portrayal of Chicago is VERY realistic - the atmosphere of the city has been captured almost flawlessly.  But great detail is also afforded to the vast array of weapons, as well as to the main car of the series (a Shelby Cobra GT500).  The attention to sound is spectacular, especially when the action sequences are played at a rather loud volume.
This is one of the best-constructed DVDs I have ever seen.  The menus are easy to navigate, with animation sequences and related sounds attached to nearly every menu selection.  Like many anime DVDs sold in North America, English audio and Japanese audio/English subtitles are available.  The ""Extras"" section has a number of offerings, including a special ""Making of"" documentary (which itself should win awards) and a creditless opening sequence (which is also part of the ""Making of"" documentary).
Gunsmith Cats is certainly one of the best anime titles to have been brought across the Pacific.  This is a prime choice for those new to anime, and an excellent upgrade for those who have previously seen only the videotape versions.",1003449600,12,1341,4.829694323144105
1409121,5,B000059RZ9,"ADV is one of the largest publishers of anime DVDs in this country-- so much that even though ADV stands for ""AD Vision"", I am convinced it now means ""Anime Digital Video"". However, most of the releases I've seen of theirs have very poor video quality-- very grainy, sometimes blurry, and in most cases no more episodes per disc than any other publisher will give you. Extras on their discs are usually few and far between.
With that in mind, the DVD of Gunsmith Cats is so amazingly good I can still hardly believe this is an ADV title. I haven't seen anything from them since which measures up to this-- from ADV or any other studio (with the exception of Buena Vista Home Video).
  What's most immediately apparent about this DVD is the video quality-- it's absolutely stunning. This is so partly because the artwork in Gunsmith Cats is some of the most crisp, colorful, and well-defined in any anime of the past ten years, and partly because ADV seems to have acquired a very good transfer of the film. As anime goes, this is probably a better reference title than Princess Mononoke; the transfer in Mononoke is slightly better, yet the artwork here is more detailed, and so the quality of the transfer is more apparent.
  A Japanese language track and an English dub are included. The dub is done by Industrial Smoke and Mirrors, ADV's own studio, and Gunsmith Cats is actually one of the best projects they've done (it was also one of the first). The acoustics for the voices are more accurate here than in some of ADV's other titles (namely Blue Seed), and the actual audio quality is on par with most other anime DVDs.
  Unlike other ADV titles, Gunsmith Cats actually does include some worthwhile extras. For the blithering Otakus of this country, a completely worthless credit-less opening is included; more importantly, though, is the making-of feature which includes interviews with the original Japanese artists and voice cast. Making-of featurettes are commonplace among most mainstream DVDs, yet in the realm of anime DVDs they are an extreme rarity.
  Gunsmith Cats can be thought of as a ninety-minute film divided into three sections. Originally, all three sections were shown on television at different times. They're all collected here into one volume to form something rare in the realm of anime DVDs-- a complete and self-contained feature, and a very good one at that. Take the first Lethal Weapon, tone down the humor, replace Riggs and Murtaugh with a couple of cute gun bunnies, and you pretty much have the essence of Gunsmith Cats-- a very well-produced anime styled after some of the best American action films.
For anime fans, this DVD is the ultimate reference piece. For everyone else, you may find Gunsmith Cats more entertaining than you were expecting. In any case, go ahead and pick this one up.",1001203200,5,2831,4.810699588477366

1409123,3,B000059RZ9,"Make sure that you rent it before you decide whether or not to buy it.  Don't get me wrong...the animation and story are decent, but I rated this 3 stars because...
 -the story is too slow in parts
 -it is definitely NOT an instant classic (such as Akira, or Princess Mononoke)
 -it's not something that I want to watch over and over again.
 -the chapter selection on this DVD is terrible (you can not easily access the scene that you want).",992476800,3,441,4.395061728395062

1409125,5,B000059RZ9,"This DVD is nothing short of amazing.  Even though a short OAV (3 episodes, about 30 minutes each), it makes up in detail.  ADV actually did an amazing job on this DVD.  I must admit that I have come to not expect that much from ADV as they didn't do well on some DVDs (ex: The Sorcerer Hunters, Lost Universe).  But this DVD just shows the potential that ADV can achieve.  I hope that ADV will continue with such high of quality.
First, I'll talk about the story.  The Gunsmith Cats is a partnership of two girls (usually accompanied by another) who each specialize in one area that contribute to the group as a whole.  The three are Rally Vincent (Gun Specialist), Minnie May Hopkins (Explosive/Bomb Specialist), and Becky Farrah (Computer/Hacking Specialist).  The series is more centered around only Rally and May.  Becky is more of a person who stays in the office, basically, out of the action.  The 3-episode OAV is actually just one story of their lives.  They all live in Chicago, getting hired for various jobs for money (almost like modern mercenaries).  They also work as bounty hunters.  The story starts off with Rally and May going after a fugitive that they want to catch.  William Collins (Bill) from the ATF (Bureau of ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, & FIREARMS) asks them (blackmails to be specific) to do a job for them.  Little did Rally and May know that this small job would draw them into something big that make them face death all too early.
The video quality of this DVD is amazing.  The transfer is simply very crisp, colors shine through nicely.  I was skeptical at first because it is an older series (around 1996 I think) and also after looking at the Lost Universe DVDs with horrible transfers.
The audio track is very nice for both Japanese and English vocal tracks.  Even though it wasn't Dolby 5.1, it surely sounded like it in my sound set-up!  The choice of using Jazz type music for the anime was really a good one.  The jazz fit the mood and setting of the Chicago area.
The extras accompanied were very nice.  The 'Making of Gunsmith Cats' feature was included as well as some ADV trailers and trailers for Gunsmith Cat episodes.  The 'Making of..' was really intriguing and interesting as you saw the extent Kenichi Sonoda and his colleagues went to to create a very realistic atmosphere.  They actually flew to Chicago and drew some scenery, took pictures, took note of the color and feel that they got from the city.  They also even did research on the guns and went to a real police station.. WOW!  Simply amazing.
Final Note:  What else could make this DVD even more amazing than it already is?  The amazing menu!  The menu had the music playing with it and it was set up very nicely with the episodes on the main menu so you can easily navigate.  The menu had the nice animations to accompany it.  Definately a must buy for any anime fan.  I cannot recommend this enough.  Gunsmith Cats has become one of my favorite OAVs, along with Ruin Explorers, Mahou Tsukaitai (Magic Users Club), & Oh! My Goddess!",987379200,,3035,4.58364312267658
1409126,4,B000059RZ9,"Gunsmith Cats, boiled down to its essentials, is girls, guns, and grenades.  Based on the manga (comic) of the same name, Gunsmith Cats is set in a surprisingly realistic Chicago and features the bounty hunter/gunsmith Rally Vincent and her grenade-obsessed partner, May Hopkins.  This disc, which contains all three episodes which were made, tells a complete (and violent) story involving gunrunners, the ATF (a federal law enforcement agency), and the ATF agent who coerces Rally and May into aiding the woefully-ineffective investigation.
The content is largely true to the comic, if you've read it; if not, it is extremely violent, with bullets, bombs, knives, grenades all joining in the mayhem.  All of the action sequences are well done; unlike most shows, animated or not, the creators took some care to get the look and feel of the weapons right (as is shown in the included making of documentary on the disc).  The car chases, too, show this level of care.  Those who like action and don't mind it bloody will find a lot to like here.  There is also enough humor sprinkled in to keep the violence from become monotonous.  On the down side, the show does find the heroines frequently in their underwear without any real reason and some unnecessarily lingering shots pop up.  There is also some incidental nudity on a computer monitor in two episodes (nothing significant, but it is there, for those who are concerned with such things).",986342400,12,1444,4.93801652892562

there's lots of action and blood in this one and even kawaii for those that like that, even a few guys for the chicks. pick up the comics and this title, now on dvd. good art from a early time in the anime eras.

1409136,5,B000059RZ9,"The Gunsmith Cats are two young ladies who own a gunshop in downtown Chicago who double on the side as bounty hunters. Rally Vincent is beautiful but deadly and knows how to handle a pistol better than most men. Her partner and housemate Minnie May Hopkins shies away from guns but is always eager to use anything with the word ""explosive"" in it! The girls have run afoul of the Bureau of Alochol, Tobacco, and Firearms and are blackmailed into helping them break up an illegal arms ring that might even involve members of the ATF. If they don't help, then their shop license will be revoked. An unkempt rugged agent named Bill Collins is their main contact that will also ensure that the Cats won't get too destructive with private property. Things become more deadly when an ex-Russian Special Forces assassin, Major Radinov, comes to wipe out anyone that knows about the arms smuggling!

This dvd contains the only 3 episodes of Gunsmith Cats that were made for the OVA market. I loved it. Even though the show is 10 years old, the animation is quite good even though it has a 90s look to it. Both Rally and Minnie were instantly likeable even though they both are a bit weapon otaku. The comedy is spot on and the action sequences are equally handled well. I especially enjoyed the detail that was paid to getting the Chicago setting just right. The staff of the show actually visited the city during production to get the right look for the setting, taking many backgrounds directly copied from actual photographs. Along with the music which originates from 1970s cop shows, this show has a distinct American feel to it. I only wish they made more episodes!

Extras: an awesome 40 minute making of documentary that includes interviews with the cast and staff, along with the original manga creator and some amusing moments in Chicago. For example, the Japanese are fascinated with the notion that guns are so easy to obtain in America, so imagine their shock when they visit a gunstore and there's pistols in the counter case with a sign reading ""Rent Me!"" Why would you possibly want to RENT a gun??!! Also features trailers and a commentary with the English director and actress that played Becky.",1152921600,,2204,4.7072538860103625

About the Production

From Kenichi Sonoda, who gained a reputation for his work on Gall Force, the Knight Sabers of the original Bubblegum Crisis and Riding Bean. Sonoda has a fascination with firearms (illegal in Japan), and wanted to feature high speed car chases (which wouldn't work in a native setting on the crowded streets of Japan.) So, he set the story in Chicago, and gave his lead mistress a muscle car - a blue '67 Shelby GT 500. As a weapons otaku, she also dons her weapon of choice, a Czech Model 1 CZ75, a piece revered by gun collectors.

Attention to detail was high on the list of priorities for Gunsmith Cats, and it really shows in the end product. The production crew used location scouting in Chicago to establish exceptional background detail. The vast number of weapons seen in the show are meticulously rendered, adding to the realism, as the carefully crafted sound design, which used the real elements, including a Shelby GT 500, for is folly effects. With the higher budget OVAs provide, the animation is fluid, and the frame composition is also interesting and impressive, with odd angles when effective.",1103673600,3,1680,4.901408450704225
1409141,5,B000059RZ9,"""Bulletproof"" is an excellent animated version of the Gunsmith Cats manga.  While the storyline is original, ample homage is paid to signature bits from the manga.  Big warehouse shootouts and intense car chases are staples of the manga, and both are represented here to strong effect.  The series doesn't match the intensity of the printed page, in terms of action, violence, or sexual titillation, but viewers are unlikely to be disappointed. Readers of the anime will enjoy seeing the characters brought to life, and first-timers will find an excellent introduction to these characters.

The animation is well done, although the character designs seem to grow lazier and sloppier in the second and third episodes.  Voice acting is decent, but the male detective character, unique to the animated version, is excessively irritating, especially in English. The English dub also throws in some unnecessarily suggestive moans where none exist in the original.

Despite these problems, the English dub may hold some appeal even for purists, since the series is set in Chicago. Watching obviously Japanese characters speak dubbed English can be distracting in other anime, but it's equally strange to watch characters in the U.S. speak Japanese.

Unusually strong set of extras for an anime DVD includes a cheaply-made yet informative making-of documentary.",1094342400,,1354,5.388625592417061
1409142,5,B000059RZ9,"Gunsmith Cats has been around for while, so one may automatically think at the top of their mind: ""Oh no!  It's so old!  It may feel outdated watching now!"" Have no fear! Gunsmith Cats settles the thirst of anyone to whom yearns for a solid anime series: new, creative, and intriguing.  First off, unlike most Japanese anime series and manga, this series takes full place in the U.S. (Midwest/Chicago)and revolves around a full cast of American/English characters (sorry, but no Japanese characters with blonde hair or blue eyes here). Rally Vincent and Minnie May Hopkins are two nubile female owners of a gun shop, so when they're called in to do investigations regarding the recent murders from an unknown organization, they quickly leap into action, ready for battle. A three-part episode series (running approximately around 90 minutes or so total on dvd) Gunsmith Cats is an extremely impressive attempt from Kenichi Sonoda at recreating the surburban areas of Chicago (there are actually Amoco gas stations spotted in the series from time to time).  Watching ""Gunsmith Cats"" may actually make a viewer forget that the series was actually done entirely in Japan.  All in all however, Gunsmith Cats is a very in-debt (though rather violet and explicit at times) action-packed series that should be able to break any anime fan's (looking for something more than just Japanese characters with blonde hair and blue eyes similar to that of ""Yu Gi Oh,"" or ""Tenchi Muyo"") thirst.

He promises them a license if they help him solve a case. -summary

One of the sub-genres within the anime medium that has grown to irritate me over the years has been the girls with guns genre, because it normally follows two simple rules: provide as much over the top action as possible, and bombard the viewer with as much fan service as humanly possible. The former I don't have a problem with as long as there's some type of creativity and interesting characters to go with it. The latter on the other hand is something I do have a problem with, because most anime directors will jam pack the screen with constant nudity and panty shots that grows very distracting, and the end result is usually a very stale anime with nothing to offer. I usually find myself going to older titles with intentions on reminding myself that the sub-genre can actually be good sometimes. Gunsmith Cats is one of those titles I can still look back on fondly.

Gunsmith Cats is a three part OVA based on Kenichi Sonoda's manga series. I have to point out that it's pretty toned down in regards to just about everything when compared to the source material. Some fans of the manga have a problem with that, while I'm just fine with it. The anime works very well on what it focuses on; action, mild comedy, and a straight-forward easy to digest plot that gets to the point.

The anime follows expert marksman Rally and bombs specialist Minnie May, as they're tasked to bring down a gun-smuggling operation. They succeed in taking down a minor player, and the result is a mysterious benefactor hiring an ex-KGB turned assassin to take them, and everyone they consider to be loose-ends out of the picture.

Gunsmith Cats is all about the action and the high speed chase. It delivers very well on what it promises, plus it does well in delivering a sharp antagonist. The former KGB named Natasha Radinov is a solid enough match for the two, and the razor-thin confrontations with her are exciting enough. For a 1995 anime, there's enough creativity during the action segments, and I can imagine most action fans getting what they want. The shoot outs aren't overly gory, but there are some detailed killings and people mowed down by gunfire.

The only problems I can think of would be the lack of character and story development. Rally and May are charismatic enough, however, they're such fun characters it would have been nice to see what brought them together and keeps them that way. I like how they're developed as real-life roommates, since they argue about each others choice of take out food. Some background on them would have been very nice. The same in regards to the setting. We know that the guns on the streets are a problem, but the anime never provides a real inside look to this and how exactly it's effecting the community. I feel this could have been examined.

I really enjoy the production values. The animation doesn't utilize a re-used cel format, and the gun battles are quick and to the point with some fast paced animation. This also goes for the car chases. The character designs and backgrounds are what stands out to me though. Rally's Cobra looks about as close to the real thing I've seen, and I also have to note the details in the weapons; the SAW M-249's look really great and the sound effects seem accurate, and this also goes for the pistols. It's said that director Takeshi Mori actually flew out to The Windy City and took pictures to bring out that Chicago feel. I never been to the city, but the anime does have a film noir feel to it.

Gunsmith Cats meshes its comedy well enough to the point where the action and content doesn't feel like a clash of artistic differences. It doesn't aspire to be anything more than popcorn entertainment and that's not always a bad thing. It would have benefited from a longer run time for better story and character development, plus it could have at least tried to be less preedictable. In any case, I haven't seen the title in more than ten years until this re-watch, and I still find it to be a fun 150 minutes. This is one anime title that does pretty good in a short run time.

Pros: Great pacing, action, and production values

Cons: A longer run time to expand on characters and setting would've helped. Predictable.",1411862400,,4597,4.603174603174603

The item arrived early and ahead of schedule in perfect condition, the DVD itself made me think it was brand new because of how clean and pure it was. Makes a great mirror! ;3

I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I would buy from this seller again.

Time to watch some anime!",1404086400,,397,4.0
