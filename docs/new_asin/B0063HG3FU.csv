Not only is the story a true to life event in the State of Alaska, but the actors , film maker's , right down to the grips are well acquainted with Alaska's harsh terms-esp. in the filming experience of this story.  A overwhelming faith based, faith building experience, a must see!",1329955200,3,455,4.481927710843373
4938706,4,B0063HG3FU,"This is a great movie and I highly recommend it. It starts out fun but quickly turns serious. 48 below is a story of survival, its about not backing down when everything seems to be against you. This is at its core a movie about faith, trusting in God and in yourself. When a group of kids gets lost on a mountainside and can't find their ways home they and their families must find it in themselves to make it through.

I've seen this movie a couple times now, both in preproduction and I'm excited to finally see it on dvd. 48 Below started out as a small school project and turned into a sensation. I'm so proud of the kids and everyone who made this movie possible. None of the people were professional actors or film makers before this project. It is truly inspiring to see what dedication and hard work can do. Not only did these kids bring together a community with their project they won the highest award in the 2010 International Family Film Festival. From a tiny town in Alaska comes a major motion picture!",1323648000,3,1018,4.386243386243386

You do not show a long sequence of set up during the credits, fade into the main characters, have them say ""remember when we met? - Yeah it was great"" AND THEN FADE INTO A FLASHBACK WITHIN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE OF THE MOVIE STARTING.

Such the case is when the six teenagers go snowboarding at 48 degrees below 0 and are I'll prepared in doing so. A young man receives an injury and everyone is scurrying to get help.

Written by: Archie Archambo
Director: Archie Archambo
Starring: Archie Archambo

and most of the other cast are related. And it produces exactly what you'd expect from a student film project that involves family and friends. Actually, no, it doesn't. It produces much less. Horrific acting, an embarrassingly bad script, etc.

When the main actor, director and writer are the same person, who is there to tell that the script is unbelievably poor and the plot laughable? Answer: Nobody...which is why you have this project.",1458950400,7,554,5.065934065934066

I kept waiting for the story to move on to at least a small part of it's genre. Religion, while woven through the story line, is the entire part of the end third of the story. This movie is trying to suck young people in by enticing them to watch because it is, THEIR type of genre, but instead instead they get hit in the head by a big board named RELIGION and proved again that organized religion is losing a lot of their flock, because many people are beginning to think for themselves, so instead they have to sneak in with a little brainwashing, which I am sure is appearing films, video games and music. All I know is that I wasted time, hoping that it might get better but no way, it just got worse.",1458000000,2,814,4.158227848101266

The acting by everyone involved was atrocious, as was the writing.  Hell, they couldn't even be bothered to give the characters original names. They instead used the names of the actors themselves!  The camerawork, lighting, soundtrack........everything was just horrible.  So bad in fact those I, and those with whom I watched constantly broke out in laughter as a result of this film's level of amateurish mediocrity.  Let's put it this way. I spent $4 on this at a thrift store.  After watching it, I came to realize that I paid $3.99 too much!  This is no exaggeration, I assure you!",1442016000,2,705,4.637096774193548

4938803,1,B0063HG3FU,"This film started out so badly, I never made it much beyond the first scene in the ""school"" building.  There, we see a new student introduced to the school teen class, along with a whiny principal who cannot even figure out if the computer printer is full of paper or not.  All the teens sat around the table and READ their cue cards, no facial expressions to evoke even the tiniest grain of emotion. Save for the obese or dietarily challenged twin pairing of two girls above average weight proportions for their physical stature. In other words, the ""snap"" sisters were fatties.

I ended my pain and nausea and turned this mess off. If this is supposed to be a film about survival of the wilderness, that's a huge flop-from-an-alternate-reality.  These dozen or so misfits cannot act their collective paths out of a wet paper bag.  Don't even think to go here, you will get bored and then have to find ways to regain your precious ""lost time"".

Beyond that, this movie was really bad, regardless. Horrid 'acting', worse script, no plot to speak of and idiotic decisions by the characters.

Pretty sure even JC would have given that brilliant move a *facepalm*

The one guy has had a child with one of the teens, but at the end of the movie he's with a different girl. It's not even like there was any reconciliation between any of them.

Yes, they were all believers and there was prayer by the towns people, but nothing showing the graciousness and majesty of the human spirit.  I was very disappointed.",1355011200,11,468,4.344827586206897

What a fabulous job this group of kids did!!  The community should be proud of what they accomplished... My hope is that it will touch everyone's life and see the truth of being who you are, where ever you are... Praise God!!  A MUST SEE!!!",1330041600,2,418,4.684931506849315
4938854,5,B0063HG3FU,Who knew a group of kids from a small town in Alaska could work so hard and make such a great movie.  With a story line much like an after school special it takes a turn not expected as the kids discover what they are made of and their own faith.,1330041600,2,246,3.823529411764706

8492064,1,B0063HG3FU,"The production team that made this movie obviously had good intentions, to made a faith-based film about rebellious teens stranded and hurt in the snowy wilderness, BUT it's a very amateurishly done job.  The kids are probably not professional actors, I'm sure for most of them, this was the first time being in a movie. Very few of the adults do any better.  The best part of this is the snow, mountains and gorgeous scenery.  It's sort of an unbelievable story, too.  Anyone living in Alaska or Canada is going to be better prepared when going out on a mountain towards evening!!  Even teens!  Anyway, I basically skipped around, just to see the ending.  Definitely a ""C"" rated movie.  Kind of a snoozer.  Maybe 10 year olds might enjoy it.",1492905600,,742,4.6461538461538465

8492066,5,B0063HG3FU,"I really don't understand all the poor reviews.  I did not go into this movie knowing it is very much a Christian based film (as I am a horror movie buff and ran into this movie by very happy chance) and that is the core of the movie.  I thought the teenagers were much better actors then they were given credit for.  I thought they were very believable.  What I really like is that they don't look like supermodel children but a child you would see anywhere, real and genuine and they were so pure and innocent that it filled my heart with warmth and love that there a still teenagers out there like that and not all sex sex alchohol boobs and sex, but pure clean Christian kids with a deep faith in God.  It is not a high production movie by any means but the soul is completely there.  The end of the movie actually made me cry with sad to very happy tears of warmth, love and faith. The end credits I loved watching the church goers dance group rocking out to a Christian song of all ages and both male and female.  It was real and warm and genuine.",1490745600,,1053,4.157635467980295
