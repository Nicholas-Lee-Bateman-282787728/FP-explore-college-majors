5229364,5,B0090XUARQ,"This is very confusing because someone at Amazon has confused this new second season of the NEW Upstairs Downstairs series with the original five-season series from the 1970s. I did not look at all the reviews here, but the ones I read described the 1970s series. Also, note that the actors listed next to the series name (Gordon Jackson, Christopher Beeney, etc.) were actors in the 1970s series. AMAZON, PLEASE CHANGE THIS!",1349136000,21,425,4.916666666666667
5229365,4,B0090XUARQ,"In this second set of episodes from the BBC's revamped UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, the dark clouds of war once again start to gather over 165 Eaton Place.

The year is now 1938.  Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) has given birth to her second child, but mother and baby barely survived the ordeal.  Weak and fragile, Agnes returns to Eaton Place where she is taken under-wing by Dr Blanche Mottershead (Alex Kingston), Sir Hallam's aunt and the half-sister of the late Maud.  Following the death of Maud, Blanche has decided to remain in Belgravia indefinitely, and despite initial hostility from Hallam and the servants, she soon finds much to occupy her time - most importantly a ""Kindertransport"", with the assistance of Mr Amanjit (Art Malik).

Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) also finds himself increasingly called away from his responsibilities at Eaton Place.  The Foreign Office is abuzz with rumours surrounding Hitler and his threats of war.  During a trip to Germany to smooth over relations with the Third Reich, he meets by chance his sister-in-law Lady Persephone (Claire Foy), now the kept mistress of a top-ranking Nazi official.  To his disappointment, Persie is as stubborn and wilful as ever before and refuses to return to England with Hallam - until the Hollands receive a frantic late-night phonecall from Germany - a terrified Persie is ringing from a phonebox whilst Kristallnacht explodes around her.

Downstairs, things are being kept up to standard by the ever-exacting butler Mr Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), in the absence of Rose (Jean Marsh), who is recovering from an attack of tuberculosis.  New nursery maid Beryl Ballard (Laura Haddock) has ambitions to create a better life and refuses to let a flirtation with chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson) derail her goals.

As the prospect of all-out war becomes a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"", the familiar household patterns start falling apart - Hallam becomes distanced from Lady Agnes, not only because of his war duties but also through Agnes' new friendship with visiting American millionaire Caspar Landry (Michael Landes).  Ever the loose cannon, Persie continues her irresponsible flirtation with Germany; and during the annual summer Servant's Ball at the Royal Albert Hall, the inhabitants of 165 reach a shattering point of no return...

This will sadly be the final series of the BBC's UPSTAIRS DOWNTSTAIRS revival, with the network cancelling the program altogether following disappointing ratings.  I am quite upset about this, firstly because I am such a fan (both of the classic series and this splendid sequel), but most importantly because the way things are left at the end of Series 2, there is no satisfactory conclusion given to the characters and their stories.  If Heidi Thomas and the production team were given some prior warning that the BBC was going to pull the plug, I'm sure the final episode wouldn't have ended on such an uncertain note.  It's like ""The House of Eliott"" all over again!

A lot of unfortunate setbacks happened in real life shortly before filming started on Series 2 of the new UP/DOWN.  Jean Marsh suffered a stroke but still agreed to participate, appearing in two brief scenes (Rose's absence sadly takes away a lot of the authentic UP/DOWN flavour - although Ms Marsh's personal well-being must take priority).  Dame Eileen Atkins decided not to continue with the show, reportedly because she had problems with the direction that writers wanted to take her character - hence why Maud had to be killed off before Series 2 starts.  I've a hunch that the Blanche Mottershead plot (or some variation of it) was meant for Maud.

Some old faces have vanished without explanation (most notably Ellie Kendrick's delightful skivvy), but there are some refreshing new characters introduced, and Alexander Faris' familiar theme tune now has an evocative ""Big Band"" flavour.  If this series isn't as bubbly or buoyant as the introductory 3-part debut season, it's still coloured by the strong characters and insightful writing that Heidi Thomas is known for.  The looming spectre of WW2 adds a great deal of urgency to the characters' storylines and the entire thing unfolds in addictive style - you'll have to stop yourselves from devouring all six episodes in one sitting.",1345593600,90,4278,5.097421203438396
5229366,2,B0090XUARQ,"Season 1 was much (as in 2 stars) better.  In fact, after Season 1 I wondered why there were only two seasons.  Now I know why.
Let's ignore the large gaping hole between the two seasons, which is a minor issue.  The character development and inter-episode drama (challenge-solution, etc.) that was strong in season 1 eroded significantly in season 2.  If it wasn't for the core thread still moving forward and strong character acting I'd rate it 1 star.  Compared to the original series, perhaps it should be.",1520640000,,510,4.75

5229374,5,B0090XUARQ,"I started watching this with little enthusiasm and only because it came up in my video queue. By the middle of the second season I was so enthralled - so invested - that I could barely stand to watch harm come to the extended family. Throughout I found myself Googling for more information on the historic details, many of which were different from what I'd learned. I highly recommend it.",1514160000,,389,4.571428571428571

5229376,1,B0090XUARQ,"I rather enjoyed the first season, but as the second season progresses, it becomes clear that everyone is self absorbed. The filmmakers also become obsessed with a lesbian love story, that ends up taking half of each show, and not adding anything to it, except making the viewer disinterested. If you enjoyed shows like Poldark, Downton Abbey, Lark Rise to Candleford, Cranford, Victoria, etc., then this show will be a disappointment.",1512777600,,435,5.140845070422535
5229377,2,B0090XUARQ,There is a 3 year jump from Season 1 to Season 2 with very little explanation. Are there missing episodes?,1510444800,3,106,4.35
5229378,5,B0090XUARQ,"A fascinating look at pre-war England and the manners and mores of the British upper classes as well as the folks who serve them. I can't decide which performance I like the best, as so many fine actors are included in this drama. One of the stand outs in my opinion is Blake Ritson as the Duke of Kent. While not a large role, he plays it with such an interesting panache, (not to mention he's handsome) it's hard not to fall for him!
I've always liked Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes who were primary in Up/Down. Clair Foy's character, Lady Holland's younger sister Lady Persy, is infuriating so you can take that as a compliment to her acting skill.
Adrian Scarborough is another lynch pin of the downstairs staff---but then so is Art Malik, Nico Mirallegro and Neil Jackson. I wish Eileen Atkins had stayed with the program, but left after the first season. And then there's Alex Kingston as Sir Holland's half sister. She joined the cast after Eileen Atkins departure. I love her acting and she does a superb job here. She's attractive and I wish I had her hair...
Some say it's nothing more than a soap opera, but that's not giving credit where due. It is a look at an interesting time in world politics and social class. The sets and costumes (Art Deco) are fantastic. They all smoke like fiends, drink to excess and the historic (war) aspects are truly interesting.
Makes me wish I were 25 years younger and had Blake Ritson's phone number! LOL. Two thumbs UP!",1510012800,4,1465,4.532075471698113

5229380,5,B0090XUARQ,"What an outstanding series. After Downton Abbey, I thought it wouldn't compare. But I was drawn in from Episode 1 Season 1 to the end of Season 2.  Just brilliant!  The plot was so intriguing and well-done - not predictable - and the acting, sets, and period piece elements were spot on.  I loved every minute!  The characters were so good and so well-portrayed. If anything, my only regret was that Hallan's mother died so early in the series- what a splendid character she was, so brilliantly played!  Highly recommend this series!",1508112000,4,533,4.75
5229381,5,B0090XUARQ,"I truly enjoyed this series. The further adventures of 165 Eaton place. The characters are engaging and well rounded. I think it suffers from a glut on
the market for period pieces. I also think the cancelation might have had a lot to do with the timing. After who can compete with Julian Fellows and Downton Abby",1505347200,,313,4.508771929824562

5229383,1,B0090XUARQ,"I'm sad I even have time say one star. I was bored at first with season one but pushed through, and I was excited about hallam' s discovery of his sister though. But now season two, what happened here? The characters choices are completely made by politically driven writers trying to manipulate viewers with our present day issues. They are so unnatural and unbelievable to the plot. Hallam so dislikes his sister-in-law (as do i) and had no compelling reason to carry on a relationship with her. Especially after his wife and newborn child almost died. Are you kidding me? Do we have you destroy all the good people?  Seriously forced plot line. This could have been a great story about WWII and Nazi Germany, but instead we make it about our sleezy modern day issues like homosexuality, abortion and adultery.  I'm sorry but in times of serious war, there was more to worry about. Sad waste of costumes. Not to mention how cliche these soap opera story lines are becoming. All the recent BBC or masterpiece theater productions have been all the same token political sympathies. Home Fires, The Durrells of Corfu, even Dowton Abbey... the secretly homosexual character misunderstood in their time, the premarital promiscuity with almost anyone at any time.
These supposed ""shocking"" plot developments are becoming commonplace and predictable. Just stop it. If you can't write better than this, then stick to the accurate adaptations of classic and beautifully written novels. Where characters are loved and believable. Where they truly act in heroic and noble ways. And no political agenda is involved. I'm tired of the subliminal underlying messages and sensationalism. BBC is losing a previously devoted fan here.",1500422400,2,1717,5.063604240282685
5229384,5,B0090XUARQ,"I loved this series, there was no disappointment in the writing or characters.  What I don't understand is why BBC pulls the plug so early on very good shows and why they only have 3-6 shows in the series.  This and shows like White Chapel are so good but they do not continue the stories.  This series of Upstairs Downstairs had so much more to give the audience, yet they cancel.  The acting was superb.  I so enjoy BBC shows more than American ones.  The Actors are superior.

This show could have gone on with many, many more series.  It is sad that there is not more to watch.",1499990400,,581,4.26605504587156

5229386,1,B0090XUARQ,Social themes of today/political correctness+gassing of animal+ridiculous plots: What a terrible show. I would give it a zero if I could. The acting is so so. Very little chemistry between the actors. The music sucks. But worst of all are those pervasive thinly veiled political/social themes that mar the story line. We are adults....give me intelligent entertainment. Not this wishy-washy kumbaya crap..... It could have been great. What a waste.....,1493942400,,452,5.4714285714285715
5229387,1,B0090XUARQ,"This was a real disappointment after watching the first season.  This season was all about how many times can they have the characters have sex with each other, with a bit of story in between.  The bad language continues as well.  Some interesting period details, esp. about WWII, but that doesn't detract from all the people jumping in and out of bed with each other.",1493683200,3,368,4.630769230769231

5229389,1,B0090XUARQ,"I couldn't agree more with the other one star rated review here but all that was said goes for Season 1 and 2.  Situations are supposed to be dramatic but I never felt anything in both seasons of this mini series.  Too bad because the original series is superb with excellent characters, plots and terrific writing.  I can't understand how the writers turned every storyline into loss and nobody getting anything, then wrapping the whole thing up with a lame party before the first air raid to conclude the whole show.  Huh?  There is no transformation in any of the characters and there is no reason to care about anyone.  I guess the writers and directors had trouble with emotion.  I did watch it all to see the beautiful sets and nice costumes and a good job was done by most of the actors who had little to work with.  I wish this had had excellent writers and direction.  And last downer for me is the music.  Some of the music cues made no sense playing certain emotions that weren't appropriate, some ripping off music directly from other composers like Debussy directly for no reason.  Any way, I've never written a review against something but this is too bad, with all of the time and attention put on it not to do a better job.",1493337600,,1239,4.4622222222222225
5229390,3,B0090XUARQ,"It was fine in the first season, but the second was an utter mess. The ending was rather jarring and quite upsetting. I am a huge BBC fan, but this revival missed the mark.",1491955200,,172,4.088235294117647
5229391,5,B0090XUARQ,"I am really enjoying this series. However, I wish I had seen that it was here on Amazon 1st!! I have been watching through Hulu. I Love HULU, but I really hate all of the commercials!!

Anyways, anyone who loves stories around WWII, &/or London 30's & 40's should really enjoy this series. This series works around life in a large house with quite a few staff. Their lives are separate, but obviously work together. Lots of storylines that weave together which is guaranteed to keep your interest piqued. The only thing I find frustrating, is that between some of the episodes, a large amount of time lapses & with it, so does the story. So when the next episode starts, your left with your chin on the floor saying, ""Wait a minute... Where did ___ go? & who the heck are these people? Wait, didn't she give birth to a boy & now she is holding a baby girl?""

I hope that I didn't curb your appetite for this flick!! I really liked it. I just felt a little cheated about a few story change overs.

Enjoy!",1491523200,,1003,4.324468085106383
5229392,2,B0090XUARQ,"I barely got through the first season and just barely episode one of the second season.
Bring back Hudson and Mrs. bridges.
I hated the way Rose was echoing lines from parts of the old classic just to draw viewers back in; it was a cheap ploy by the writers.

There just isn't the same chemistry in this revival of the cherished '70's classic.
The upstairs stories are rock solid, but this revival lacks the cohesive energy that brought the below stairs characters in sync with their employers.
The new butler is the steadfast enough in his duties but then we're confronted with his distasteful views as a conscience objector during the first world war. Cook is too abrasive and the overall complexion of the downstairs lives and escapades is almost bilious and at odds with their upstairs employers.
just can't get into this new series.",1491264000,,837,4.732876712328767

5229394,5,B0090XUARQ,"Really wish that BBC hadn't axed this series. On the whole, it is quite well done, and it only improved with each successive episode. After watching the pilot in Season 1, I wasn't quite sure what to think, but it picked up quickly, and I got sucked in. The acting, especially nearing the end of Season 2, is really exceptional, in my opinion. Sad that there isn't more.",1490140800,,370,4.455882352941177
5229395,1,B0090XUARQ,"Upstairs Downstairs Season 2- a perfectly dispiriting show filled with heavily telegraphed developments, inept character development and scattershot direction. As hard as it tries to romanticise an elaborate scheme, the story line is surprisingly dull and the characters one-note clichs. Poor character motivation from quick cuts at almost every important juncture. Overall nothing much happened in a total of six episodes.

5229438,1,B0090XUARQ,"Season 1 was amazing! We watched the first season in one setting. So we thought why not give season 2 a try? The second season somehow did everything wrong. The main characters seemed to be bipolar all of a sudden.

Sir Hallam, who was a gentlemen and loving husband in the first season, all of a sudden forgets himself. He becomes distrustful and distant to his wife. While they have been married for at least 5 years now the two seem completely changed.

The mother of the main character Lady Holland all of a sudden is no longer present. She died with little explanation. Instead, a lesbian half-aunt is introduced which besides helping with Jewish orphans, which any other character could have done, added next to nothing to the plot. This smells of political agenda and it stinks terribly. Oh and kicker? Sir Hallam Holland's best friend the Duke of Kent's wife is the lover of the half-aunt.

Both maids are replaced inexplicably. They introduce a new love interest in Beryl for driver Harry Spargo. They bring in some kind of orphan labor person to help improve the maids living and working conditions. But not that of the men who are servants in the home. The dear main house keeper, Rose Buck, appears in one episode since she is sick.

Throw in an abortion of Lady Persie for good measure, an affair of Sir Hallam Holland with the younger sister Lady Persie for no apparent reason other than a kiss by a girl totally lost offering no future, and treating men as cowards such as saying the butler Warwick Pritchard objected to the first world war. Not to mention putting down Americans too with the introduction of a rich billionaire trying to win over Lady Agnes Holland.

Why not focus on the plight of the Jewish children and people?

This was like a cheap, trashy soap opera.

Everything that was good, sacred, endearing, and wonderful about season 1 is gone. It's like a completely different writer wrote the second season. Perhaps to get back at the producers for cancelling the series for a 3rd season? We did not finish the second season and were quite disgusted. DO NOT watch this second season.",1485907200,5,2113,4.663978494623656

The brilliant Claire Foy as Lady Prudence's Nazi sympathizer gave me  a look back into the young actress who would be queen in ""The Crown"".  Downton Abbey upstaged this wonderful tribute to the original ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and if it were not for that marvelous program we wouldn't have had a Downton Abbey I dare say~",1484179200,2,510,4.738636363636363

It's about an aristocratic family and their servants who live in a townhouse at 165 Eaton Place. In many ways ""Upstairs Downstairs"" begins where ""Downtown Abbey"" left off. ""Upstairs Downstairs"" could have taken place at Grantham House in 1936. It's a story about how the impeding war between Britain and Germany profoundly affected one London family and their servants.

The story of episodes was believable, well acted and usually went in the imagined direction of predictable endings. Nevertheless; this series was so good that I wanted it to continue, but at a fast pace, in the last episode, things are cleared up and explanations of the characters, as well. Proving that even the rich have secrets and sins as do the working class.
I realize the time frame, yet never get used to servants who have to dress another perfectly capable human. If this sort of behavior is still in operation, today, then the maters will be in poor health for lack of exercise in simple things they can do themselves.",1463961600,3,777,4.984615384615385

5230401,5,B0090XUARQ,I love movies from this period and especially from England since I lived there for 3 years. This series is one of my favorites just like Dontown Abbey. I like the old version of this too.,1461715200,,187,4.222222222222222

5230409,1,B0090XUARQ,I did not like the 2nd season. It was full of seedy sexual content and subjects and may be part of the reason the series was cancelled. The first season was great and the second was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Too bad.,1461715200,6,212,4.195121951219512

5230422,4,B0090XUARQ,Good storyline.  Historically accurate.  Audio could be better - actors lines are sometimes overwhelmed by background music.,1461715200,,124,6.235294117647059

5230433,5,B0090XUARQ,"This production gives me everything I want from a British period piece -- eye candy (pretty people, beautiful clothes, lavish furnishings and lush scenery), plus the gamut of British accents. The plot is engaging - so much so, that it looks like the writer of Downton Abbey stole from it. Great acting.",1461715200,,302,4.826923076923077

5230437,5,B0090XUARQ,Loved it. It was sad that they had to end this program. I like a devoted husband like Hallam but it was disturbing when he fell for his sister in law that ruined his happy marriage.,1461715200,,181,4.055555555555555

5230439,4,B0090XUARQ,"No, it isn't the Bellamy family, the story line has a lots of new twists that we never would have seen in the original.  Loved the acting and found myself rooting and cheering for the underdogs!
The scenes of 165 Eaton Place didn't always fit with the original, but chalked it up to modernization, however, below stairs was, in my opinion, changed too much!
I'm glad that Miss Buck, Rose, had scenes, it kind of tied everything together.  The ending was great, in that it stopped in a logical place.",1461715200,,499,4.533333333333333

5230443,4,B0090XUARQ,Frankly quite appalled at the tobacco use that would have been considered very bad form for the period in some of the situations. Makes me question if there was major tobacco sponsorship on the program. Still would love to see the story continued on to show the war time. Those who lived in the cities especially London took such a hard pounding and the heroic spirit of the British would make a great showcase to their indomitable will.,1461542400,,437,4.615384615384615

5230470,5,B0090XUARQ,Love this series!  It was interesting for me to learn a bit about the war from England's perspective--what they went thru and how they took the lead in so many areas. (Made me want to learn more.)  The actors were wonderful and fit their roles perfectly.  I couldn't get enough of their stories... I want another season!,1461024000,,320,4.578947368421052

5230472,4,B0090XUARQ,Interesting show.  My wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit and were sad it was so short.  Evidently there were health trouble that made it impossible to continue but an interesting show.  The final episode was an unsatisfying ending and left quite a bit hanging but that was due to the shows abrupt ending.,1461024000,,303,4.472727272727273

5230481,2,B0090XUARQ,"Characters and plot line were not very well developed - things just seemed to happen without much explanation or lead-in. A lot of things were left completely unfinished, too, with the abrupt end after 2 seasons. There are much better period dramas out there (but maybe my standards are just way too high with DA just finishing :) But, I mean, having said that, I kept watching, wanting to know what would happen. So I guess it gets the two stars for that.",1461024000,,456,4.506024096385542

5230499,2,B0090XUARQ,"Very poor writing. Atkins made it publicly known before the second series filmed that she hated the script amd was not returning as Maude. So they kill Maude off. Wise decision. That left Agnes, Hawes' character, with no conflict at Eaton Place. So they bring in actress Alex Kingston, who plays Maude's half-sister, as Agnes's ally. I Would rather one of Britain's numerous older acting veterans had played that, and we'd seen more conflict there. The Persey/Hallam affair was preposterous. He despised Persey as a traitor in final episode of series one. Why would he sleep with her now, even just for sex? He kicked her out of his house, repelled by her! Jean Marsh's stroke diminished her screen time, sadly. Pritchard, a drunk, is noticably missing, most of the time, in several episodes. It simply has fine actors, but miserable writing.",1460332800,2,842,4.936619718309859

But this series is every bit the equal to Downton and more. While this takes up at some period where the original Upstaors Downstairs left off, it is a completely updated and different animal. The story and the stars are superb, detailing England in the mid 30's to early 40's regarding upper class and service class life and the situation and evolution going on the classes. The story is riveting, bring elements of the people involved and the society that they lived in into play showing the evolution of people in the era, and people at a personal level and how changes were affecting the average person.

5230533,1,B0090XUARQ,"Okay, so the series is actually awesome, 5 stars, but what is not: Season 2 was available free with Amazon Prime, so we watched all but the last episode over course of a month. Then, without notice, the entire Season 2 switched over to $1.99 per episode, with no warning. Seriously? I understand that if a series becomes ""too popular"" some pointy-headed bean counter decides that what was free for Prime subscribers could now be capitalized on, or that one season of a series is free, but woe to you if you want season 2 (see Boardwalk Empire), but there comes a point where this strategy alienates customers.

 im sorry thats just way to diverse at a time when aristocrats are watched over with judgemental eyes and highly fragile societal positions in a society of somewhat Victorian values, and 1920's america.

Mrs. Buck, the housekeeper is in a sanitorium for tuberculosis and the house is running without her  and Hammish's mother has died, leaving an aunt in her wake. (awful pun) I am good with changes in cast as long as I am part of the process. This change just slammed contract issues and the characters were gone. Mrs. Buck does appear briefly in Episode Three or Four but only to be told to hold on to her house key. Even the monkey is killed off. John attempts to test a special pram  that was purchased to protect the newborn from smoke inhalation, turns the car on in the garage and asphyxiates the monkey. Ah well. Just dumb drama that doesn't do the characters any credit.

Spoiler alert; Agnes goes after an American who uses her shamelessly in his advertising for stockings and she must break off the arrangement, but Hammish has dragged Percy out of Germany only to save her again after a botched abortion and then ends up in bed with her because Agnes can have no more children and has cut him off. These are the tittle-tattle soap operas are made of. Look forward to seeing Percy as Ann Boleyn in Wolf Hall. I am sure someone will be writing stronger dialogue there. As to Agnes, oh she nobly gives up the American after gazing as her sleeping children... I guess Hammish is practicing noblesse oblige with his kept sister-in-law while the Elizabethans would have thought that incest.

5230612,1,B0090XUARQ,Thought this was a good series until in season two when they bring into play the lesbian issue. Lost interest as once again the modern media tries to cram this crap down our throats.,1416787200,7,182,4.382352941176471

5230614,2,B0090XUARQ,I am just not feeling the characters anymore.  The emotion feels forced and the relationships are not ringing true with me.  The period sets are very nice though.  I can see why this series ended after two seasons.,1416528000,,214,4.578947368421052

5230621,5,B0090XUARQ,"The entire story line leaves you hungry for more. The characters that play employees of such a grand family are so real. As for the wealthy, I cannot speak of how they would truly conduct themselves for I have not been around such grandeur. Even so,  empathy for Lady Agnes is definitely called for. Betrayal from a family member is almost to much to bear. Not on the edge of your seat type of series, BUT certainly worth viewing! Only wish it would have had season 3 or more.",1415923200,,476,4.348314606741573

5230626,5,B0090XUARQ,"This is the original series. It's suca great show! They deal with social problems such as...sex before marriage, death just to name a couple. And if you are looking for something with NO car crashes, NO shoot-outs this this is it.",1415836800,,230,4.634146341463414
5230627,5,B0090XUARQ,"I really liked it. The actors were fantastic and the characterization of the pre-world war II it is quite good. It is sad that they decided to discontinue this show.

5230631,5,B0090XUARQ,I absolutely love this peek into a time period we didn't learn much about (pre-WW2 Europe). It's so fascinating to hear how the tensions in Europe began to build and how much seemingly small things could lead to huge problems. The drama in this show is fantastic and well acted and can't wait to watch more.,1415836800,,307,4.5

5230638,4,B0090XUARQ,"Another excellent BBC series. A little too much hanky panky written in and little about the war years themselves. But I guess that is easier to write about than doing research on the war years. For me, that isn't enough. Otherwise, it is touted as an excellent series, even though this second season seems somewhat unrealistic.  More for the gossips than the armchair historian.",1415059200,,378,4.90625

5230646,5,B0090XUARQ,"This sequel to the original Upstairs, Downstairs involves the late 1930s lives of a diplomat's family, their staff, and whispered rumors of war. While there is much intrigue, secrets, even lies involving both up and down stairs dwellers, the opulence and atmosphere of the Victorian/Edwardian period (a bygone era) and WWI is no more; the elegance remains, but much subdued, the attitudes toward staff are more relaxed. It is rather interesting to observe the changes that are occurring in lifestyles of all social strata on the threshold of WWII.
The series originally conceived/created by Jean Marsh, Eileen Atkins, and others, lost no appeal with the sequel written and created by Heidi Thomas.",1414454400,,697,5.232142857142857

5230651,4,B0090XUARQ,This season's portrayal give one the insight as to what was going on in the minds of some of the people pre-World War 2.  They never thought their world would change so.  I found it very entertaining.,1413849600,,200,4.378378378378378

5230653,2,B0090XUARQ,"Disappointing - it feels like the top writers left, and the third string set in to drag the series over the finish line.  Apparently just to initiate conflict, two hitherto thoughtful and honorable main story characters suddenly behave in completely incompatible and self destructive manners.  Finally, in the last episode, the story becomes a hodgepodge of nonsensical actions, highlighted with a stereotypical accidental shooting of a sympathetic character, and a suicide.  At the final scene, all I could think was, ""Finally, it's over!""",1413676800,,540,5.481927710843373

5230668,2,B0090XUARQ,"It started out brilliantly, but ended up awfully.  The introduction of infidelity into the story-line was pointless at best.

In addition,  the introduction of both politically correct subject matter and marital infidelity (for no reason - simply, I assume, to make it more ""exciting"") was disappointing.",1411084800,,394,5.2063492063492065

5230712,3,B0090XUARQ,"I wish I could give this show 3.5 stars, it's really a decent show (especially the first season). The second season was over-dramatic, its plot became somewhat ridiculous toward the end.  The cast definitely deserves praise, all the main characters fulfilled their roles very well, and their relationship dynamics were believable. I never watched the original seies of U/D, so I cannot compare the two. Spoiler alert: I wasn't sure if the show was just trying to be historical when portraying young JFK, but it bothered me that he came across as a disengaged and very uncharismatic young man (even though JFK in real life considered himself an introvert, his character's acting was introverted in a very unnatural way).  This show is a lot like Downton Abbey, it's basically a high quality soap opera (still a soap opera).  If you're looking for a great period drama involving English aristocracy that is not a soap opera, I highly recommend HBO's Parade's End.  Parade's End is not about fun plots, but it is based on excellent source material and offers first-rate acting. It is a very enjoyable miniseries for history and literature buffs!",1408924800,,1142,4.963350785340314

It is a continuation, so to speak, as the house is sold to another couple - the husband a diplomat and his wife.  The story takes place on the verge of WWII.

Too bad there aren't more episodes. One surprising element of the British aristocracy is the amount of illicit sex they took part in. It seemed like every ten or fifteen minutes of these programs someone was humping someone else. I guess the producers wanted to insure the personal stories of the characters were interesting. I come from the old school of movie watchers and don't need titillation to keep me interested. The series as a whole though is very good and well worth the time to watch.

5230774,4,B0090XUARQ,"I'm a big Downton Abbey fan, so while going through ""withdrawels"" between season 4 and the upcoming season 5 I happened upon this series. What I particularly liked about it was its time frame in England--the early to late 1930's. I'm a WW II student (by dint of my English background having been born there) with focus on the war in Europe. So, anything related to the period prior to and then on into the 1940's is of interest to me. Upstairs/Downstairs is interesting on several fronts, but the most interesting to me was the political interactions taking place in the Holland family both within and outside the family. I found the two season series(albeit a short season  one) rather enjoyable and as interesting to me as the on goings in Downton.",1405209600,,750,4.681818181818182

Especially since the affair was merely with the most convenient trollop, the sister-in-law, Lady P. The staff go through a few of their own upheavals, but the affair really dominates this season.
The ending of the season is perhaps, bittersweet. The conflicts are resolved, but no one is able to fix or forget what happened and there are a few letdowns for the chauffeur and the housemaid, for the husband and the wife, for the young man going off to fight in the war.",1400457600,,626,4.7

Dame Eileen Atkins decided not to return for this season. Also, Jean Marsh was only in two episodes due to suffering a minor stroke. This season wasn't quite as good as season one but I still liked it. I understand why there wasn't a season three. The changes in season two probably didn't sit well with most viewers of season one.

There is just a few things that bothered me.  If the show picks up 5-6 years after the original series in the 70's which i watched as a teenager then how did Rose Buck get so old?  She left the Bellamy's at best when she was in her 30's or 40's and then she says she gave them 40 years of service...the math never seemed to make sense to me.  And what happened to the Bellamy's...some indication was made that Lord B died but what about Mrs B...I thought Rose went to work for them?  Lady Percy got on my nerves but I suppose she was meant to and why did Hallum have to have an affair with her...it made him look really stupid.  Anyway it dragged on and on and so many of these shows concentrate on prewar 1 or 2 ....like the world never was interesting after that....but i enjoyed it anyway and i would watch a season 3 if there was one.  I think I am just hanging on to the Bellamy's after all.  But I would like some of those clothes and furniture.  Where ever did they get those lamps?  Send me one.",1400112000,,1208,4.1373390557939915
5230830,3,B0090XUARQ,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS SHOW.  MY  PROBLEMS WERE THAT 1) THEY WOULD LEAVE THINGS UNFINISHED IN AN EPISODE THEN JUMP AHEAD IN TIME.  EXAMPLE:  ONE CHARACTER JUST SORT OF DISAPPEARS BETWEEN SEASONS AND YOU HAVE TO ASSUME WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  2) NEW CHARACTERS WOULD APPEAR AND YOUR LEFT TO PIECE TOGETHER HOW THEY BELONG IN THE STORY.

5230834,2,B0090XUARQ,"This one is tough to review, because I can't decide whether to base my rating on the acting and costumes (good) or the storylines (bad). The trouble with season two is that the writers tried to pack in everything scandalous they could think of, making the whole season one giant soap opera. The character of Hallam starts out an honorable family man, but suddenly and with no real explanation, takes a sharp turn the opposite direction. Meanwhile another character, Persephone, pulls off her dislikable role a little too well, making you want to turn off the TV. The closest thing to a non-hatable character is Lady Agnes, but even she frequently flip-flops between being a fair and caring woman and a spoiled snob. As for the staff, many of the servants we're meant to sympathize with simply annoy with their constant disloyalty, whining, and blackmailing. Overall, the season leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth and a desire to wash it out by watching something less sordid.",1399507200,5,982,4.816568047337278

The Upstairs/Downstairs story is fascinating and gives insight into the class system in England.  The Upstairs people and the Downstairs people have their own lives within the house, yet the interaction between the two is intriguing.
The script is so well written. I never seem to get tired of it.
I would recommend it for anyone interested in history and those who are fascinated by how people live in other parts of the world.  I adore the English people, how they follow the rules of etiquette, how proper they are, even though I'm glad we are more open and demonstrative here in the U.S.  I would not care to be as stiff and formal as they were at that time in history!",1398211200,,767,4.536231884057971

Personally, in spite of my dislike of the Brits and all their faults, I loved Upstairs Downstairs and wanted it to pass on to my daughter and grandchildren, so they could learn about the world around them.",1394755200,,515,4.516129032258065

This was portrayed by fine, British actors and the joys and the life of a Statesman and family members of the time period before WW II was very compelling..  Well done.",1394064000,,273,4.551020408163265

5230911,5,B0090XUARQ,"Some new performers deserve attention. Laura Haddock in particular, shows her versatility as an actress in a role somewhat more subdued than her performance in ""Honest"" and still fetching as Byrl Ballard, one of the house maids. Keely Hawes  is also great. This is a quality production, and I for one will keep watching. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates the polish of British entertainment.",1393804800,,398,5.03030303030303

5230917,4,B0090XUARQ,"If you like Downton Abbey you'll probably like this since they're both based on the same concept. The time gaps between episodes was a little awkward for me but other than that I loved this show. I love the style, wardrobes, etc. It may not be the best acting but again I love the story line and think it's maybe a little more true to the original than others I've seen.",1393459200,,370,4.225352112676056

5230924,3,B0090XUARQ,"Good program, but I found the constant background music very distracting. It disallowed the audience to response emotionally independent of its continuous waltzy smalzty tract....which was why I had to turn it off.

I grew up watching Upstairs Downstairs as a young girl and couldn't hardly wait for the week to pass to ""get back"" to my hour of British television!  I re-discovered the original series about 6 years ago and enjoyed watching it again, in a much shorter space of time.  Thoroughly pleased with my walk down memory lane.

So sorry to see it end so abruptly.  Hope the producers consider bringing it back again.",1392681600,,676,4.491803278688525

5230936,5,B0090XUARQ,We are so fortunate to have such good programming available to us. I do wish this were on in prime time television available to everyone so that we can know our history better . Our society today needs a reality check to see and hear of our progress. our failures that may bring things into better perspective today. The acting is so good that you quickly become one with the characters and the plot.

Season 1 was so much better. The sister in-law was never a favorite but she literally made my skin crawl this season. In fact all of the upstairs characters were very unlikable. I was hoping they'd all get on a plane together and crash somewhere over the Andes thus putting me out of my misery!!!",1392422400,4,455,4.493975903614458

5230939,5,B0090XUARQ,The series has kept my interest the entire time. I would watch one episode after another.  It was difficult to tear away from the show to do anything else. It allows us to escape into the world of royalty and be a part of their family!,1392249600,,235,4.108695652173913

5230942,5,B0090XUARQ,"I love this series. It struck my interest because of the similar story line on Downton Abbey which I totally enjoy. As I watched it occurred to me that this is the ""City"" version of Downton and probably inspired the Downton series.",1392163200,,231,4.523809523809524

Season two started off and Wow !! is it horrible.
Kill off the main character (mom) and the monkey?
Different characters without telling where they came from??
Never before have I seen a show that comes back for a second season and suck so bad.
If it wasn't free I'd be writing Amazon looking for a refund.

5230954,4,B0090XUARQ,"I was pleasantly surprised by this series, having no background other than it's slight similarity to Downton Abbey. However, it's no Downton. It's better. It presents a more complex storyline, better characters and better production.

I feel like this series centers more on the lives of the Upstairs people, namely Lady Agnes, Lady Persie, and Sir Hallam (and various others).  It is a sadder tale than DA, but still very good, I really enjoyed it and was sad to see that it was canceled after this season.  I would have liked to know if the characters had happy endings?

5230979,5,B0090XUARQ,Amazon Prime offers more intelligent alternatives to most series.  Be prepared to enjoy the characters and time period depicted in this series.  You will be disappointed.,1390867200,,170,5.5

5230982,5,B0090XUARQ,"I found the series to have excellent Starkel references. I believe the division in terms of the ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" was not as wide as I expected due in large part to their shared common factor: their humanity.",1390867200,,218,4.7631578947368425

5230988,5,B0090XUARQ,I absolutely love period shows and Upstairs Downstairs is no different. I enjoyed all the main characters and the end turned out exactly the way I wanted it. Workers of iniquity punished and the decent folk were able to carry on with their lives. Lovely mini series.,1390435200,,266,4.680851063829787
5230989,3,B0090XUARQ,Like I said more like a soap opera but still has good characters and story to follow could be a little more moral,1390348800,,113,3.9565217391304346
5230990,3,B0090XUARQ,beautiful design to this production.  plot is slow then becomes suddenly dark.  characters are somewhat 2-dimensional and could use more complexity.,1390348800,,148,6.0

5230994,5,B0090XUARQ,Upstairs Downstairs is a lot like Downton Abbey.  It's a great story line and it keeps you interested through the whole series. I love movies set in this time period. It is worth watching every episode. Hope they come out with a season 3 soon.,1390176000,,243,4.4

5231003,4,B0090XUARQ,A few of the main characters from Season 1 are not in season two without anything leading up to their death.  I would have liked closure on those characters as one in particular was my favorite.,1389916800,,194,4.388888888888889

5231010,5,B0090XUARQ,Loved it.  The characters are well developed and I think the story is real and show s people's vulnerabilities. Very good and very intertwining. Love show in this era.,1389830400,,167,4.758620689655173
5231011,5,B0090XUARQ,Well done drama of the England that faded. Decadent rich people with time on their hands to act out their fantasies and get into trouble,1389830400,,136,4.48
5231012,4,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoyed it, disappointed that it only lasted for two seasons. Some of the adult scenes could have been left out and the entire family could have enjoyed it.",1389744000,,158,4.482758620689655

5231014,4,B0090XUARQ,"Story line is good, keeps my interest. Actors are attractive and do a great job of being in character. Left 5th star off because I need to watch with subtitles as some of the speech is too fast making it incomprehensible.",1389657600,,221,4.414634146341464

5231016,2,B0090XUARQ,"This  version of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" started leaking oil at the beginning of Season 2. Although, I was seeing some serious plot points and anachronisms before that. I will admit to not knowing, chapter and verse, how a household in England and the people ""in service"" therein, were run on a day-to-day basis. But I'm pretty sure it was nothing like the sweetness and light offered up here. I have noticed several ""BBC America"" produced shows that seem to think we Americans will pretty much swallow anything shipped over here, as long as the accents are in place and there is at least one kindly, elder character with twinkly eyes and a remedy for anything that may happen. Did the Lords and M'Ladies really take this much of an interest in the lives and well-being of their staff? I doubt it. There are too many contrived and just plain unlikely plots with pat solutions, that seemed to fall out of the sky and now we're all smiling and happy. The writers seemed to have a list of ""issues"" and not enough time to deal with them. Boiler plate ""British"" characters that, more than anything, needed a swift kick in the ass and a good talking to. Yes, Persie, that's you. On the good side, this sputtering mess made me seek out and start watching the original series. Cheerio!",1389657600,,1276,4.621145374449339
5231017,3,B0090XUARQ,"The whole reason I watched this series is because I watched the original Upstairs, Downstairs and fell in love with the Bellamy's and their staff. Rose lends some nostalgia to this series, but it isn't quite the same. Nothing is ever as good as the original. It's like comparing a movie to a great book. It can't measure up.l",1389657600,,325,4.52542372881356

5231023,5,B0090XUARQ,Fun and interesting to watch. Good character development.  More gentle than some earlier versions. Gives insight to buildup to WWII - particularly to how little was done to help the Jews while there was still time.  Also insight to the wind down of England's old social and economic order.,1389398400,,289,4.877551020408164
5231024,4,B0090XUARQ,I didn't think I would like this show but after getting into it I LOVED it. So bummed there were only 2 seasons. :(,1389398400,,115,3.8333333333333335
5231025,5,B0090XUARQ,Continues the story from one in great historical context and is believeable.  I learned about Edward Charles due to this program and he's an interesting royal who was actually a Nazi who lived in Germany,1389312000,,203,4.8
5231026,5,B0090XUARQ,Wished it could have lasted a bit longer.  But other than that it was good!  Sorry that Jean Marsh (who played Rose) couldn't participate more in the show.  Love that era.,1389312000,,171,4.451612903225806

5231031,5,B0090XUARQ,"The acting in upstairs downstairs is very good! The characters are becoming friends to me now that we are all in the second season.

5231032,4,B0090XUARQ,it was entertaining. Similar to downtown abby.  Would like more recommendations of similar programs. Thank you very much.  Is there a season 3?,1389139200,,143,5.173913043478261

5231034,4,B0090XUARQ,I enjoyed the development of the characters and the depth of each one . There is plenty of action and intrigue to keep us wanting to watch more than one episode in a sitting!,1389052800,,174,4.147058823529412
5231035,4,B0090XUARQ,Like Downton Abby this series is enjoyable because of the interplay of the characters. If you liked Downton Abby you will like this.,1389052800,,132,4.782608695652174

5231038,5,B0090XUARQ,This is a great show. It's too bad Ty only filmed two seasons. I would have loved to watch more.,1388966400,,96,3.85
5231039,5,B0090XUARQ,"True to period and decline of aristocracy told with humor, love, politics, and with quite seriousness - perfect representation of the upper class in England.  Can't watch it enough!",1388880000,,181,5.241379310344827
5231040,3,B0090XUARQ,It was pretty good - but acting was mediocre.  I did not care for how some of the storylines ended.,1388793600,,99,3.95
5231041,2,B0090XUARQ,"I really enjoyed the series, but the episode with Blanche meeting her female former lover was too in-your-face for me.  I appreciate that the characters were presented as real people with complex feelings and positive as well as negative traits, and I don't think that homosexual characters should be villified (they are simply people, after all), but I am as unwilling to bring their bedroom theatrics into my living room as I am heterosexual bedroom behavior.",1388707200,3,461,5.065789473684211

5231043,5,B0090XUARQ,We loved the characters and storyline of this series. Too bad there weren't more seasons.  Stories got into some pretty good character depth.  A nice way to bridge the gap between Downton seasons.,1388534400,,196,4.909090909090909

5231045,3,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoyed the show for its historical fiction, however the show seems to focus mainly on the ""upstairs"" and not very much on the ""downstairs"", and suddenly the main focus turns to Hallam's affair with his sister-in-law.

Despite the disturbing affair, I do wish the series had continued.",1388361600,,287,4.979166666666667
5231046,5,B0090XUARQ,"Same as my review for Season one.  But two heats up even more...UNBELIEVABLE  ; I never thought it could be any better.  So fabulous.  I just wish there were more.

5231056,3,B0090XUARQ,"I thought that this iteration of the series was lacking in quality of story line, acting and other aspects.  It didn't seem to have what it takes to hold my interest and get involved in the story line.  The original series was awkward in some respects because of the limitations of filming in the early 70's, but was still better than its continuance.",1387584000,,351,4.555555555555555

5231067,5,B0090XUARQ,"Enjoyed the first season, just had to view the second. Really liked it. Was not disappointing. Is there a third season?",1385683200,,119,4.714285714285714
5231068,5,B0090XUARQ,"great story lines... can't wait for the next season to start.  Love the period costumes and the actors.  Such diversity in all of the characters, and each with their flaws and perfections..no one is perfect!",1384819200,,207,4.885714285714286
5231069,4,B0090XUARQ,"I watched this after watching all available seasons of Downton Abbey. It is a poor substitute, but it was okay.",1384646400,,111,4.6
5231070,5,B0090XUARQ,I hope they make a new season of this drama.  It is very engaging.  I am looking forward to seeing these characters to evolve.,1384646400,,126,4.208333333333333
5231071,5,B0090XUARQ,I love everything about this show. I'm extremely sad that it was cancelled after season 2. It's still so good that it's worth watching.,1384387200,,135,4.666666666666667
5231072,5,B0090XUARQ,"This series is worth watching. You will be drawn in from the very beginning. The characters are complex even if they don't appear to be so at the beginning. The world goes from safe and secure to one of upheaval and uncertainty. Some are strong and some are weak whether it be in character or morals. Money is a way to a means for some and something to sell your soul for, for others. Some who appear strong are not and some who are weak show their true strength and character.",1384300800,,477,4.252747252747253
5231073,3,B0090XUARQ,"I was disappointed that Season 3 is not with CC, because I am hearing impaired.  Otherwise I am comparing it to Downton Abbey and up against this is does not come close to be upper successful",1384214400,,191,4.305555555555555
5231074,5,B0090XUARQ,"Love this show. Such an interesting look at the change that took place in classes not so very long ago. The historical background makes it a must see, and for all that, it's a captivating story line.",1384214400,,199,4.405405405405405
5231075,5,B0090XUARQ,"I left my primary review of this series for Season one, but just a brief note here to state that this second season even outdoes the first, if that is possible.  It just gets better and better. Some of the romantic pairings and triangles reach a boiling point here and the direction and performances are superb. I cried when it was over - simply because it was over. They MUST make more for this version...
So fabulous!",1384128000,,419,4.441558441558442
5231076,2,B0090XUARQ,just not as good as downton abbey. hard to compare the too. find myself loosing interest when I watch it.,1383868800,,105,4.3
5231077,4,B0090XUARQ,"Rich characters and several plot lines to follow. Great period piece, loveable and hate-able characters.  You will enjoy this series.",1383696000,,133,5.65
5231078,3,B0090XUARQ,"It's ok but, nothing  in comparison to Downton Abbey,  I guess I 'm  spoiled, but I must say Upstairs. Downstairs gives me a better understanding of the workings of the household.",1383523200,,179,4.709677419354839
5231079,5,B0090XUARQ,"Great show, did not see the original but really liked the show. The cast worked well with good acting. 5 stars",1383436800,,110,4.285714285714286
5231080,5,B0090XUARQ,"Love this story, the writing is very good. Its fun and addicting. This is a good tv series that will leave you wanting to watch another season asap.",1383264000,,148,4.321428571428571
5231081,4,B0090XUARQ,"Love the costumes, period furniture, furnishings, etc.  Somewhat similar to Downton Abbey.  I reserved one star because for some reason it is a show I watch for fun rather than the plot, which is not deep in my opinion.  War and cheating are the themes for season 2.",1383264000,,266,4.5
5231082,5,B0090XUARQ,It's a great series with interesting characters and fabulous costumes! A window into an era of war and changing alliances. Enchanting!,1383264000,,134,5.428571428571429
5231083,5,B0090XUARQ,"Another great period drama on BBC. If you like Downton Abbey, you will love this! Unfortunately, Upstairs Downstairs wasn't renewed after season 2, so enter the story at your own risk.",1383264000,,184,4.967741935483871
5231084,5,B0090XUARQ,"The story line leaves you waiting anxiously to see how they are going to solve their problems.  I started watching it because a friend said it was good, but i had no idea it would be so well done..",1383264000,,197,4.051282051282051
5231085,5,B0090XUARQ,I thought it was great!  I cannot believe it was not renewed for a second season.  The glamour and the acting by Keely Hawes was far better than the sisters in Dowtown Abbey.  Howver no one can beat Maggie Smith?  Dowtown Abbey makes me feel that I want to visit that part of England but Upatairs Downstairs makes me feel as if I want to be part of the story.  I would gladly scrub floors just to witness the characters.  Pooh on BBC For deciding not to renew it.,1383177600,,463,4.146067415730337
5231086,5,B0090XUARQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed streaming seasons 1 & 2 of this historical drama with Amazon instant video over the course of a few weeks. It really draws you into the aristocratic life (and their servants) in the first third of the 20th century.  Beautifully acted and filmed, with great character development,  and I even learned a few things about history - never knew about the organized British fascists! I loved the occasional presence of Duke of Kent - a melancholic figure - and the Clooney-like American Mr Landry. The older women characters are also very interesting, and the Sikh Mr Amanjit adds welcome diversity. The plot got a bit unbelievable at the end with the estrangement between the principal married couple; one hoped they might reconcile in later seasons, but .... the show was cancelled! If you can accept being left hanging on the brink of WW2, it's worth taking the plunge.",1383091200,,887,4.867549668874172
5231087,5,B0090XUARQ,Not having seen the original I did really enjoy this one. The addition of Alex Kingston was great. As with any Brit shows you will see several Dr. Who actors though,1382918400,,164,4.32258064516129
5231088,4,B0090XUARQ,"Not Downton downtownor is London uptown? And I can't say I had much sympathy for any of the charactersthough well-drawn, they were all expendable, storywise, so far as I was concerned. But visually a lush and quality-produced series and certainly worth watching.",1382745600,,262,5.261904761904762
5231089,5,B0090XUARQ,Just as good as Downton Abby .Very interesting -historically. Beautiful and sad at times. Great writing. I hope it comes back to PBS,1382659200,,132,4.782608695652174
5231090,5,B0090XUARQ,The acting was great...much better than the original series...hope the the BBC continues the series.  Can't wait to see the next episodes,1382400000,,137,5.2272727272727275

5231092,5,B0090XUARQ,"I was addicted to the show Downtown Abbey and this is my buffer between seasons, and I think I may enjoy this show slightly more!!! It's a REAL storyline compared to DA !!",1382227200,,171,4.212121212121212
5231093,5,B0090XUARQ,This is a very interesting series. It's nice not to see all the same actors/actresses that we see in the USA.,1382140800,,109,4.238095238095238
5231094,4,B0090XUARQ,Not as good as #1 but still very good and it keep my interest but not like the first one. The story line was just a little off for me from the start of this series.,1381881600,,164,3.5833333333333335
5231095,5,B0090XUARQ,I Love all of them so far...Keep them coming! I get lost in the era of these shows and all the costumes and the staff and families.,1381708800,,131,3.888888888888889
5231096,5,B0090XUARQ,I was so excited to hear that there was a sequel to the original.  I enjoyed it so much and never wanted to see it end.  I got my mom and sisters hooked on it too.  Great drama series!,1381449600,,184,3.6666666666666665
5231097,4,B0090XUARQ,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series.  The story line is strong, and the acting is believable.  I have not been a fan of period English drama in the past,  but this one is a winner.",1381449600,,181,4.114285714285714
5231098,5,B0090XUARQ,I gave this a 5 star because this series had my attention from the very beginning.  I love period/history series and this one is truly a watch over and over again type.,1381449600,,168,4.25
5231099,5,B0090XUARQ,"Try to view in sequence,  the original series revolved around the Bellamy family and ran for many seasons on PBS.",1381363200,,113,4.65
5231100,5,B0090XUARQ,A show that I love and I recommend to anyone with Amazon Prime access. I would also recommend this to any fans of Downton Abbey.,1381104000,,128,4.16
5231101,4,B0090XUARQ,"A good show with lots of side plots. Not up to par with Downton Abbey, but not bad. Worth watching.",1381017600,,99,4.0
5231102,5,B0090XUARQ,it is a truly wonderful serie. The set is so aprpropriate to their time period and also an excellent screen play.,1380931200,,113,4.428571428571429
5231103,4,B0090XUARQ,This is a very interesting Master Piece project and I intend to follow it through all the seasons they produce!,1380844800,,111,4.6
5231104,5,B0090XUARQ,"Love, love, love this show! I think the actors/actresses portrayed the era perfectly! Costumes and set design were brilliant. Too bad this show was cut short.",1380844800,,158,5.115384615384615
5231105,4,B0090XUARQ,"This show is enjoyable, too bad there aren't more seasons. Some of the love story lines were unnecessary while others added to the story.",1380758400,,137,4.75
5231106,4,B0090XUARQ,"First seasons were great. Good story. Good character development. Historically accurate.

This is too time consuming. Make shorter please now.",1380758400,,142,6.1
5231107,3,B0090XUARQ,"This was a great and entetaining remake until mid way through season 2, then it felt rushed and overdone at parts. I would recommend season one, but I am not as impressed by season 2.",1380672000,,183,4.257142857142857
5231108,5,B0090XUARQ,"If you liked Downton Abbey, you will enjoy this. It's a little bit gritty just like DA and I love watching the show.",1380585600,,116,4.086956521739131
5231109,4,B0090XUARQ,Period clothing and vehicles were perfect.  Storyline well thought out and interesting.  Much like Downton Abbey.  Good players for this type presentation.,1380499200,,155,5.954545454545454
5231110,5,B0090XUARQ,Fun dramatic and interesting. Downton Abbey in the city. Characters are enthralling and story lines believable. I say watch it.,1380412800,,127,5.4
5231111,5,B0090XUARQ,I loved the the series never boring . I had to watch more then one episode each evening. The cast members are excellent actors.,1380240000,,127,4.333333333333333
5231112,5,B0090XUARQ,Enjoyed Season 1 & 2. I wish they would not have cancelled future seasons. I recommend this as an excellent drama.,1380240000,,114,4.476190476190476
5231113,5,B0090XUARQ,"Thie series is similar to Downton Abby in that it exposes the life of the aristocratic family that lives upstairs and the house staff that work downstairs.  The photography captures the grandeur of this home with all of its excesses.  Each of the characters is developed at various points in the series giving the user a feeling of belonging.  Well, maybe that is going a little to far; however, I felt that I got to know each of them as the plots developed.  Though it is like Downton Abby, they are different enough so not to over do the pverall theme.  I haven't looked to see if there are additional episodes.  I would buy more if there are.",1380067200,,645,4.423728813559322
5231114,3,B0090XUARQ,"I watched this series after watching Downton and maybe that's why I wasn't impressed. Hard to hold a candle to Downton's cast, costumes and scenery. I didn't care for the characters.",1379980800,,182,4.903225806451613
5231115,5,B0090XUARQ,I loved this season for the same reasons I loved the first season. I wish there had been a season 3.,1379808000,,100,3.8095238095238093
5231116,1,B0090XUARQ,"Season 1 of the new upstairs downstairs was fun to watch. It was well paced, not overly dramatic, and not sexed-up. Season 2 was all those things. We were looking forward to season 2 but didn't even finish wratching it. What a waste of good character development from the first  season. They were ready to progress into the beginning of the war and the social changes that took place at that time. I know that people had affairs and that homosexuality is not only  a postmodern issue but why does all entertainment have to be inordinately focused on that one aspect of a story line?  I never could figure out if I was being preached at, the writers started to take themselves too seriously after the success of the fist season, or if they were a groups of junior high children.",1379808000,5,777,4.49645390070922
5231117,4,B0090XUARQ,"The acting, the cast, costumes and the cinematography was great. As it is my observation with many  series, they either do really well and can keep up with quality of the plot or it can downgrade a bit. I enjoyed this season but from my own perspective, it is not as wholesome as Season 1, which is one of the huge reasons I love BBC. They know how to translate books to the screen with tainting it with our modernity. Though Season 2 was good, I just did not enjoy the sexuality even though it was discreetly done. Just my two cents.",1379548800,,534,4.235294117647059
5231118,4,B0090XUARQ,"Tells the prewar story with some quite interesting twists.
Hopefully, they will find a way to do several more seasons!",1379548800,,118,4.95
5231119,5,B0090XUARQ,This is such a great storyline.  The acting is fantastic and the characters are unforgettable.  I can't wait for next season to begin!,1379548800,,134,4.782608695652174
5231120,5,B0090XUARQ,It shines in every way. You won't be disappointed  with this stellar piece of art. I only wish it had continued a few more seasons.,1379548800,,131,4.24
5231121,5,B0090XUARQ,Loved this show.  Very sad that it only went 2 seasons.  This was my filler until Downton Abbey came back and it was perfect!,1379462400,,125,4.166666666666667
5231122,4,B0090XUARQ,"I listen to this at work in the background while I type. It's a good show. It is a bit predictable. Not like ""oh I think there might be a war coming!"" Predictable as in certain people getting closer or more far apart. Getting real sick of the curly headed lesbian aunt tho. Does EVERY thing have to be a reference to Egypt? Send her there!",1379462400,,339,4.151515151515151

5231125,5,B0090XUARQ,"Loved seeing the continuation of the story started by the original long running series.
Well written and very well acted.",1379116800,,121,5.1
5231126,2,B0090XUARQ,"The characters are all great but the story line steadily decreased in quality. I saw they cancelled it after the second season, its kind of sad they didn't get a chance to really shine. Second season is still better than the first.",1379116800,,231,4.523809523809524
5231127,5,B0090XUARQ,This new version is as good as the original.  It is wonderful that all the characters have at least one issue with which to struggle.  I watched the whole season in one day.,1379116800,,173,4.212121212121212
5231128,4,B0090XUARQ,"Well acted and written, this drama is interesting and entertaining. I found it less 'soap opera' than the original version.",1378944000,,123,5.2
5231129,5,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoyed watching the second season of Upstairs. Downstairs Season 2. It is a great mix of history of the time right before World War 2, in the same way that the original Upstairs Downstairs did with World War 1.",1378944000,,213,4.35
5231130,5,B0090XUARQ,Great show. Really enjoyed it. Great story line and great acting. The divide between the two worlds is poignant and shows the resilience of the human spirit to adapt.,1378512000,,166,4.758620689655173
5231131,5,B0090XUARQ,I am really looking forward to Season 3 becoming available on Prime or Netflix!  Good drama and the show should be watched from Season 1 to really get a feel for the characters.  I enjoyed watching the older version of the show as well and seeing Jean Marsh in both versions.  She is such a good actress!,1378425600,,304,4.298245614035087
5231132,5,B0090XUARQ,"Yes, Really enjoy this series. Enjoy the historical fiction. As we watch it, we begin to identify with the characters.",1378425600,,118,4.95
5231133,3,B0090XUARQ,"Liked it but it could have been better. Each episode felt undone, unfinished like something had been left out of the story.",1378425600,,123,4.636363636363637
5231134,4,B0090XUARQ,I would like to know if there is a season 3 as the ending of this season left things open.,1378339200,,90,3.55
5231135,4,B0090XUARQ,"This was rather entertaining, sadly not like Downton Abbey but a little bit of the history of that era.  I watched it with my Amazon Prime Membership and it was worth it, but to have to pay for each one, I honestly don't think I would have done that.",1378339200,,250,4.1020408163265305
5231136,2,B0090XUARQ,Where are some of the main characters?  So many questions.  I think the 2nd season is thin on development of the characters and plot.  I'm a bit disappointed,1378252800,,157,4.535714285714286
5231137,5,B0090XUARQ,If you like Downton Abby you will most likely like this. Really great characters. I would love to see more episodes!,1378252800,,116,4.571428571428571

5231143,4,B0090XUARQ,We especially liked the historical aspects of it.  The building up to WW2 and Britain's reactions was informative.  It was a little Soap Operaish.,1377734400,,146,5.041666666666667
5231144,5,B0090XUARQ,"If you like period drama, this is definitely one to watch.  I tried watching the original series and couldn't get past the 70's ""feel"", this is lush, well acted, excellent camera work and well worth watching.",1377734400,,208,4.777777777777778
5231145,5,B0090XUARQ,"I decided to try this show, because I was missing Downton Abbey... I was delighted the minute I started watching.  It's funny, serious and entertaining.  Try it, you'll like it too!",1377734400,,181,4.806451612903226

5231147,5,B0090XUARQ,"If you like the age when aristocrats had nice homes, maids and butlers, you'll love this show. I stay up late into the night watching it.
Upstairs, we see the lives of the rich while downstairs we see the trials and tribulations of the maids and butlers and cook's lives. Intriguing.",1377561600,,283,4.568627450980392

5231152,5,B0090XUARQ,"I had always heard how good this series was, but I had never seen it and never seemed to find the time to watch. Now, I can't stop watching and want to be a part of this household. I'm so intrigued by the history of those times, how the ""average"" family (although this is not your average family household) was affected by politics and war. Most importantly, it just shows that the human condition never really changes! Love it!!",1377388800,,429,4.443037974683544

5231157,5,B0090XUARQ,I really enjoyed the upstairs downstairs series. I only wish they would have kept going with it. Kind of similar to Downton Abby.,1377216000,,129,4.6521739130434785
5231158,4,B0090XUARQ,"I really liked it, but sad it has now been cancelled by the BBC.  It's similar to Downton Abbey, but not quite as well scripted.",1377216000,,128,4.12
5231159,5,B0090XUARQ,I hated to hear that the series was cancelled.  I thought that it was very well made.  The characters are well developed,1377216000,,120,4.409090909090909

Cast does a very good job portraying their characters",1377216000,,131,5.6

5231163,4,B0090XUARQ,"Similar to Downton Abbey, has colorful characters, and shows the relationship between the Upstairs residents & the downstairs servants.  Riveting episodes with unexpected turns.  Get to see the political views from so many perspectives. Love, loss, war, happiness, gloom, jealousy, anger, death, and new life is all seen in this spectacular series.",1376956800,,348,5.673076923076923

5231167,5,B0090XUARQ,Very engaging.  Says a lot about the differences and similarities of the haves and have nots.  I liked the first series when it came out be found this script to be more refreshing.,1376784000,,180,4.424242424242424

5231170,5,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoyed this very much.  Doesn't really compare with Downton Abbey, but is a close second.  I became engrossed in the characters and what was happening next.  I hope it has another season.  Definitely worth watching!!!!",1376524800,,221,5.055555555555555
5231171,4,B0090XUARQ,Upstairs Downstairs is a great contrast to Downton Abbey. The 2 British TV series are also very similar. Hopefully our friends at Amazon will give us another full season of Downton Abbey and we will forgive Upstairs Downstairs for leaving us with great angst at the beginning of World War ll.,1376438400,,292,4.745098039215686
5231172,5,B0090XUARQ,"Not surprising- -I'm a big Downton Abbey fan, so I was pleasantly surprised with this series.  Good story lines.  Just wish there were going to be more episodes.",1376438400,,161,4.714285714285714
5231173,5,B0090XUARQ,"This series is very well done.  If just draws you in.  I look forward to each new episode.  The acting is outstanding.  And, the costumes are amazing.  If you love fashion, you will hope that this style of clothes comes back in fashion.",1376438400,,236,4.395348837209302
5231174,4,B0090XUARQ,"However, this is NOT Downtown.  The cast is smaller and the writing is not as witty, but there is a surprising relationship that turns the entire house upside down.",1376352000,,164,4.655172413793103
5231175,5,B0090XUARQ,Great acting.  I am sad there will be no more.  Characters are well-chosen and the plot is great.  Highly recommend.,1376352000,,116,4.7

5231177,5,B0090XUARQ,This season had quiet a bit of more drama in it compared to the first season. I can not wait for season three.,1376352000,,110,3.8260869565217392
5231178,5,B0090XUARQ,"This TV show quickly descended into a ridiculous, salacious storyline and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. It's a fun show for a weekend, and only 2 very short seasons. Watch it!",1376352000,,173,4.4375
5231179,5,B0090XUARQ,"Great story line, absorbing lightweight watch.  However, S2 ends on a cliff hangar and the series wasn't renewed. Apparently no plans for that.",1376265600,,143,5.217391304347826
5231180,4,B0090XUARQ,"Loved the time frame from which this series was filmed.  They did well keeping costume and decore period accurate.  Story line involved more than one class of people giving multiple perspectives.  I was sad the oldest actress, the lady that staffed the home was no longer part of the primary story.  However given her age I imagine health caused a rewrite.",1376265600,,356,4.786885245901639
5231181,5,B0090XUARQ,I thought this season was great! There were a few story lines I didn't see coming. Hoping they make a season 3!,1376179200,,111,4.090909090909091
5231182,5,B0090XUARQ,"I like the characters and, of course, the setting. A sharper dialogue than Downton Abbey which is carried well by the actors.",1376179200,,125,4.7272727272727275
5231183,5,B0090XUARQ,"I have been aware of this series for a long time but didn't watch it until recently.  I watched the remake and thought it was wonderfully done.  The plots, actors, costumes and decor were great.  I wish it had gone on for another season as I wanted to see how things turned out.",1376179200,,278,4.2075471698113205

5231185,5,B0090XUARQ,Great show. They shouldn't have cancelled it. Shame. I told so many of my friends about it before I realized they cancelled it and left you hanging.,1376092800,,148,4.518518518518518
5231186,5,B0090XUARQ,It is as good or better than Downton Abbey!  Shame it got cancelled.  Keeley Hawes is terrific. Always love that downstairs stuff.,1376092800,,130,4.863636363636363
5231187,5,B0090XUARQ,"I love this show and I love Maggie Smith.  All of the actors did a wonderful job. As I've said before, I love British TV. In this show, you get to see both sides of live, the upper crust and those below.  Yet regardless which stairway your on, you can tell they all are committed to each other. The story line is excellent and each one draws you in even more.",1376092800,,359,4.042253521126761

5231189,4,B0090XUARQ,"I don't want to be educated in the details of the War, just the family-saga aspect so thought all the war-talk was not interesting.  I'm sure it is very interesting to many, but I changed series and may go back, skipping portions of the programs...  Otherwise, it was the usual good drama which I appreciate so much.",1375660800,,316,4.526315789473684

5231191,4,B0090XUARQ,This series was abruptly canceled which is unfortunate - I thought the characters were interesting and the storyline was fairly well developed.,1375660800,,143,5.545454545454546

Keep making more please!",1375574400,,144,5.590909090909091
5231193,5,B0090XUARQ,"A well done follow up to Season One, but I would be less than honest if I didn't admit that I miss the character of Maud, Lady Holland.  She was a good grounding, in spite of inviting That Woman to dinner, to a former, more elegant era in which everyone knew their place and knew all of the social rules by heart.",1375488000,,313,4.048387096774194
5231194,5,B0090XUARQ,What a shame there are only two seasons.  I will have to watch the original series to see if its as good as these were.,1375401600,,119,3.76

5231196,1,B0090XUARQ,"The writing for this show is horrendous. Absurd plot twists occur but the audience hasn't established any strong connections to the characters, so the twists come across as awkwardly sudden developments.

It seems as though someone came up with a to-do list for salacious plot twists prior to writing the show. When it came to the writing, someone must have sat down and written the screenplay in an exhausted all-nighter, somehow managing to contribute less depth than a middle schooler would add to a book report.",1375315200,5,515,4.988372093023256
5231197,5,B0090XUARQ,"This series brought back memories when I was a little girl, the women were first class in every way, I remember every thing that the people went through during WWII here at home, it had to be terrible in England.  The whole story kept me spellbound.  I hope that it continues this year.",1375228800,,286,4.377358490566038
5231198,4,B0090XUARQ,"I still enjoyed this series, but the characters did not seem to have continuity with the past characters.  I didn't feel  as drawn to the people and their lives as I have in the past series.  I still will watch the next Season!",1375228800,,227,4.232558139534884
5231199,5,B0090XUARQ,"Not only did Downton Abbey steal a lot of good ideas from USDS, but poor programming choices on the part of the UK networks pitted the shows against each other!  DA is good, and I really like it, but this show was so compelling (and far more original!).",1375228800,,253,4.270833333333333
5231200,5,B0090XUARQ,This is a wonderful show. The acting and costumes are wonderful! It is very addictive. Similar to Downton Abbey. Can't wait for more seasons!,1375228800,,141,4.916666666666667
5231201,4,B0090XUARQ,Pretty good set similar time period but in the city. Like sisterhood of traveling pants vs sex in the city. Maybe.,1375228800,,114,4.476190476190476
5231202,3,B0090XUARQ,Season 2 was rather dramatic in some believable and not-so-believable ways but fun nonetheless. Too bad we won't have a season three to look forward to.,1375142400,,152,4.884615384615385
5231203,4,B0090XUARQ,"The political theme seems well developed, but is too shadowy.  I think it would liven the series to give higher profile to the events the characters are involved with in the political arena.  Some of the characters seems somewhat thin as the season develops.  I thought the current 21st century social perspectives and activist themes were too self-conscious in the series.  They seem to try too hard with social comment on current social issues, seeming strained and artificial for that era.  But maybe that was an authentic characteristic they are making known to us.  There were positive dynamics that presented the flavor of the era, in the clash with modern advertising, which becomes a conflict for this aristocratic family.",1375142400,,730,5.092436974789916
5231204,1,B0090XUARQ,"There are things that are right and things that are wrong. This show tries to make things wrong, right. To much of the producers agenda came across instead of sticking to the story line. Sad!",1375142400,4,191,4.485714285714286

5231208,2,B0090XUARQ,"The first season started out with promise, but when Hallam began an affair with Persephone, the series lost it's individuality and became like any other nighttime soap opera.

5231217,5,B0090XUARQ,"Season 2 follows the cast at the start of WWII. Some great new characters (Mr. effing Landry is seriously too hot, he looks like a younger George Clooney!!!) and some crazy scandalous stuff! If you were even remotely interested in the first season, then be sure to watch this!

Loved this show, and I thought that the second season was much more interesting than the first! I watched the whole thing in a couple days, then read an article about it being cancelled so no season 3  >:(  I hope with enough online interest they'll bring it back like they've done with other shows.",1374624000,,577,4.528846153846154

good show to watch and learn how different eras have evolved throughout history

I am curious if these types of families still exist today in Europe?  It makes me want to learn more about the
past, present and think more positively about the future.",1374364800,,349,4.507936507936508
5231222,3,B0090XUARQ,"It was not bad by any means, but the amped up sex and shift from what made Upstairs, Downstairs so popular in the first place really hurt this season.
The fact that it ends with several cliff hangers (in some ways, in some ways not.) and will not have a third season as far as we know, makes it difficult to recommend.
The production quality and acting is top notch though, and there are some amazing twists.",1374105600,,408,4.311688311688312
5231223,5,B0090XUARQ,"I love historical romance stories and this is one of the best.  The characters are so well defined.  It's one of the rare series that shows a person who wants to do something wrong, but rallies their innermost strength to live according to their beliefs.  It's too bad they did not continue this series more than two seasons.  The ""other"" Upstairs, Downstairs"" doesn't compare in any way.",1374019200,,388,4.746268656716418

5231237,5,B0090XUARQ,I loved Upstairs Downstairs. I was sad when I finished the last episode.. Loved the characters and story lines. Looking forward to new season.,1373328000,,142,4.958333333333333
5231238,4,B0090XUARQ,"Please see my review of season 1. The same holds for season 2, only more so. I highly recommend this series and I hope the producers create another season.",1373328000,,155,4.379310344827586
5231239,4,B0090XUARQ,Love this series.  Deffinitely worth while.  It's like the next generation of Downton Abby.  Characters are intriguing -- both the heros and the villians.,1373328000,,154,5.333333333333333
5231240,4,B0090XUARQ,"I'd seen an earlier version of upstairs downstairs .. black and  white and I think broken up into half hour episodes.  I didn't care for that one, the acting was more like a bunch of people gathered from a bar late at night after too much drink and putting them in costume.. too loud, too much everything .. overdone too loudly.  This version is more refined in e very way, not so loud not so overdone.
I really like the costuming, settings and the overall production of this version and it's in color.  So it wasn't so hard to watch.  It was closer to our current favorite Downton abbey than the other version and more addictive than the older version of Upstairs downstairs. But it's  one of  those things..you either like these type of shows or you don't.  It's not action packed and not full of action like so man shows, but that's why they're called action adventure. I don't know what  these would be called.. period drama?  I'm not great at writing these reviews ;-)  I'd prefer giving it the number of stars I want and going on, but it won't let you.",1373328000,,1058,4.402061855670103
5231241,5,B0090XUARQ,"I think the entire series kept my attention, I love Downton however it can be dry and boring at times. I hope they reconsider putting UD back on.",1373328000,,145,4.214285714285714
5231242,5,B0090XUARQ,I loved it.  The characters were so well-rounded.  I loved each and everyone.  I am addicted to british shows anyway.  I think the plots are awesome.,1373328000,,149,4.615384615384615

5231244,5,B0090XUARQ,This series has everything and I like it because it follows history and what is happening in the world as well as the life of an upperclass British family and it's servants.,1373328000,,173,4.4375
5231245,4,B0090XUARQ,This is a very well acted piece. Love the period costumes and furbishments. How big is the props warehouse anyway?,1373241600,,114,4.75

5231250,3,B0090XUARQ,Characters were not engaging enought to want to relate to.  Story line was predictable and most times boring.  Never got past season 2.,1373068800,,135,4.826086956521739
5231251,5,B0090XUARQ,My husband and I viewed the programs together.  The programs gave us a different look at history as well as providing us with an interesting plot.  We are looking forward to seeing what happens in the  upcoming season.,1373068800,,218,4.684210526315789
5231252,4,B0090XUARQ,I cannot wait for the next season.  I hope there are more episodes than season two.  Very well acted and directed,1372982400,,113,4.333333333333333

5231256,5,B0090XUARQ,"This season brought to live the time just before the 2nd world war.  It was scary to see  how gullible some people were in believing Hitler was not going to start a war.
The servants were the most interesting in this series.  Loyalities, betrayals, and intriques kept me wanting to see the next episode.",1372982400,,303,4.574074074074074
5231257,3,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoyed this show. Sometimes it takes you places you don't want to go, but ultimately I liked it. The development of the characters was the best part. I began watching the show just to see what would happen to them. I will watch again next season.",1372982400,,249,4.319148936170213

5231259,5,B0090XUARQ,A very well written show that keeps you interested. The acting was great and we wish there were more of these shows.,1372723200,,116,4.318181818181818
5231260,5,B0090XUARQ,Like going back in time.  Interesting story lines.  Not quite so predictable as the usual fodder.  Also might like Downton Abbey.,1372723200,,129,5.0476190476190474
5231261,5,B0090XUARQ,Really an attention grabber. Character development is great and interrelationships make for great continuity of plots. Can't wait for next season.,1372636800,,146,6.0

5231265,4,B0090XUARQ,Very interesting perspective on the life and times in the recent English past. Was intrigued by the way the elite lived in that period and the life of servants.,1372636800,,160,4.551724137931035
5231266,5,B0090XUARQ,These British productions are so well done. It's easy to get lost in the story and befriend the characters. I am always sad to see each season end.,1372550400,,147,4.285714285714286
5231267,5,B0090XUARQ,British period costume drama at its best. Characters you grow to love and care about in a setting that's a delight to the eye.,1372550400,,126,4.291666666666667
5231268,4,B0090XUARQ,I started watching first series of shows and was hooked.  When I saw the second series of shows I had to watch it. I hope there will be a third season because there's so much more left unsaid,1372550400,,191,4.026315789473684
5231269,5,B0090XUARQ,I enjoyed the whole season. It was fun and exciting. I really enjoyed watching. I liked the interactions by the cast.,1372550400,,117,4.619047619047619
5231270,3,B0090XUARQ,"Its an entertaining period drama, which towards the end of the second season has too many plots and doesnt wrap up quite well. Perhaps because it was cancelled.",1372550400,,160,4.75
5231271,4,B0090XUARQ,I thought this was an excellent period piece.  The 1930s and 40s were a time of great changes and preparation for war with people caught up in events that were unable to change.  I thought the character development interesting and their responses to world situations believable.  Good story.  Can't wait for the next season.,1372550400,,324,4.944444444444445
5231272,3,B0090XUARQ,"However, in my constant struggle to satisfy my craving for period pieces, it certainly does well in a pinch and for that reason, I enjoyed it.",1372550400,,142,4.5
5231273,5,B0090XUARQ,Give this series a try. You'll get used to the on-stage-like acting in no time. Addictive & wonderful. Try it.,1372550400,,110,4.55
5231274,4,B0090XUARQ,I love British drama; it's always so well performed. The characters are well chosen and the scenery is in keeping with the period.,1372377600,,130,4.695652173913044
5231275,5,B0090XUARQ,I love this series and cannot wait for season three to be released.  The acting is good; the story line is intriguing; lots of plots going in different directions by the various characters make you want to see what is going to happen next.,1372377600,,239,4.431818181818182
5231276,4,B0090XUARQ,"Enjoyed the original series. Season 1 of this continuation was good, but there is a big discontinuity with the beginning of Season 2.  Characters have been removed and little explanation is give.  Thosecharacters that remain and the additions in this season are enjoyable,",1372377600,,272,5.3023255813953485
5231277,5,B0090XUARQ,Loved it to say the least.  I look forward to season 3. I had no idea that it would be so engaging.  Thanks Amazon,1372291200,,114,3.7083333333333335
5231278,4,B0090XUARQ,Acting is superb.  Leave it to the English to strife for perfection.  Watched all Seasons and hope there will be more coming soon,1372291200,,129,4.565217391304348
5231279,5,B0090XUARQ,I enjoyed seeing this period peice and getting a sense for what the world was like before WWII. I don't know if the portrayals are accurate but they feel real.,1372204800,,159,4.333333333333333
5231280,5,B0090XUARQ,I can not wait for the next episode.  This show does not get boring.  I have been reccomending this series to all my friends.,1372204800,,125,4.166666666666667
5231281,5,B0090XUARQ,I fell in love with this family as much as I did the original family.  I love their lifestyle.  The downstairs staff is just as interesting as the upstairs family.,1372204800,,163,4.4
5231282,5,B0090XUARQ,I enjoyed season 2 much more than season one but I realize that a lot of season 1 was laying the foundation for all the great drama and storylines found in this season. Season 2 basically grabbed me from the first episode and I found myself watching one episode after the other. Can't wait to watch Season 3.,1372204800,,308,4.327586206896552
5231283,5,B0090XUARQ,I could not stop with season 1 so continued to season 2. Love the cast. I will look for more choices.,1372118400,,101,3.857142857142857

5231285,5,B0090XUARQ,"I loved Season 2 even more than the first one.  I can't wait until 3 begins!!  However, it was a horrible way to end the season.  For those who need a fix, try the new Upstairs/Downstairs.  It takes place right before WWII and will fill that craving hole.",1372032000,,255,4.25
5231286,5,B0090XUARQ,"Somehow the British knows how to make love and war into a romance. During war time the family and housekeeping seem to become one, even with the difference of statue. I highly recommend this series its has loyalty, lots of dishonor and lets just say you can't always trust family. Great watch, was hoping season 3 was out but not so I'll have to wait patiently for more drama",1371945600,,375,4.449275362318841
5231287,5,B0090XUARQ,Interesting to watch a program with actual dialogue and not have to listen to background music/noise drowning out the actors.,1371945600,,125,5.3
5231288,5,B0090XUARQ,"I liked both sessions and look forward to more. If you enjoy anything British and historical you will like it,",1371945600,,110,4.55
5231289,5,B0090XUARQ,"This had all the elements of a British period series one would expect and true to the author's work, and tastefully and timelessly done, as well.  Casting played nicely against one another as the characters should be, and tastefully was both visually elegant yet natural in contemplation of beauty well beyond the superficial yet inclusive of it as well.  None was presented in obvious clumsy markers one one expect to see in a cheap lulu thrown together (budget notwithstanding) that is quite often the result of classic works turned to screen, and a work of artists.",1371945600,,568,4.90625
5231290,5,B0090XUARQ,"Well written and enjoyable story lines.  Stayed true to the original series. Also, if you like Downton Abbey, this is for you.",1371772800,,126,4.7272727272727275
5231291,5,B0090XUARQ,"So good, and so attached to the characters. I so hate they canceled this show. Such a mistake by BBC.",1371772800,,101,4.1
5231292,4,B0090XUARQ,"Having a Downton Abbey withdrawl until the next season starts,  I decided to watch Upstairs Downstairs I wasn't all enthralled with the first episode - however, it gets much,much, better.  Worthwhile my time watching -- and will probably watch it again.  I have recommended it to others.",1371772800,,287,5.0638297872340425
5231293,4,B0090XUARQ,"I'm a real fan of Downtown Abbey, so I thought I'd give this a shot. Worth the time to watch.",1371686400,,93,3.7
5231294,5,B0090XUARQ,"Love this mini series & look forward to next season. It proves that whatever plight we have in life truth, kindness, and honesty are always the best policy. People are people and no one escapes life untouched by illnesses, disease, war, or accidents. The downstairs people may not be "" biological family"", but are family nonetheless. This historical look at the ""haves"" and ""have nots""  of society in the UK are fascinating. Can't wait to see what happens next.",1371686400,,461,4.8354430379746836
5231295,5,B0090XUARQ,"With war approaching, you could not predict which way things would go. Everyone seems to go mad and with unexpected consequences. I thought it was excellent and am waiting for the next season to see how things will come back together again.",1371686400,,240,4.738095238095238
5231296,5,B0090XUARQ,Very good. I watched both seasons 1 and 2. I am left hanging. Ready for the next season. I can't wait!,1371686400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5231297,5,B0090XUARQ,"Wonderful show I the tradition of Downton Abbey, but set in London during WWII.  Rich characterization with interesting story lines that bring out history you might not in about that era.",1371686400,,187,5.032258064516129
5231298,5,B0090XUARQ,"Great acting, interesting plot, interesting and authentic for time period. Really really terrific. On same level as Downton Abbey. Can't wait for more. Please, I hope there will be more.",1371686400,,186,5.233333333333333
5231299,5,B0090XUARQ,"For Downton Abbey lovers (especially), this is the costume drama that will leave you craving more. Appropriately-paced, richly written characters & story, gorgeous costumes & settings, Upstairs Downstairs is a story that draws you in from its first moments through its unravelling of the intriguing history of the London home & it's owners & servant staff.",1371686400,,356,5.375
5231300,5,B0090XUARQ,Better than season 1 I couldn't sleep till I watch all the episodes I hope another season is coming up,1371686400,,102,4.15
5231301,4,B0090XUARQ,Interesting look at that time in England. It is also pretty to look at. The treatment of disabled children was appaling.,1371513600,,120,4.761904761904762
5231302,5,B0090XUARQ,The examination of the social interdependency of the noble and servant classes continues.  The first series has a worthy successor in this sequel.,1371427200,,146,5.3478260869565215
5231303,4,B0090XUARQ,"We enjoyed the look at societal changes going on in the 30's blended with the historical political atmosphere. Will the series continue? If so, we will continue to watch.",1371427200,,170,4.896551724137931
5231304,4,B0090XUARQ,I gave it 4 stars because that's the highest rating I give. I love historical fiction and this was extremely well done and well acted.,1371427200,,134,4.4
5231305,5,B0090XUARQ,"Just a few years later than DA, amazing how things have changed! The urban milieu also is an obvious change. Liked it very much. Another BBC home run :-)",1371340800,,153,4.310344827586207

5231309,5,B0090XUARQ,I loved the storyline and the costumes. The designer did a great job recreating that period. The story line was catchy and I loved it.,1371340800,,134,4.4

My husband wss totally sucked in. He only wished there were more shows.",1371254400,,123,4.904761904761905
5231311,5,B0090XUARQ,Takes place just prior to the beginning of the war w/ Germany...lots of political intrigue as well as intrigue within the family upstairs and the servants downstairs.....hate to see it end!,1371168000,,189,5.129032258064516

5231316,5,B0090XUARQ,Thought all of the episodes were great. Loved the storyline that built up to Germany invading England. Just sad that there won't be anymore episodes. Would love to see more.,1371081600,,173,4.8
5231317,5,B0090XUARQ,Man I'm so sad this show is over. Great series absolutely loved it. Cried when I found out it would not be back,1371081600,,111,3.869565217391304
5231318,5,B0090XUARQ,"Set in post WWI England, it shows the build-up to WWII and how that affects both the working class and aristocratic England.",1371081600,,124,4.681818181818182

5231320,5,B0090XUARQ,"I of course watched the original Upstairs Downstairs years ago, and then again when it came out on my pad.  This second version was not as well done as the first, but it was from a totally different era, one which I had lived through, so it was hard to romanticize it.  It was not a romantic era.  Considering what they had to work with to maintain accuracy, I think it was very good.",1371081600,,384,4.162162162162162
5231321,3,B0090XUARQ,"The new series is ok, but I liked the original 70s series a lot better. It still addresses the huge gap between the ""high society' and the servants. It shows that both have their own problems and having money doesn't necessarily take those away.",1370995200,,245,4.590909090909091
5231322,5,B0090XUARQ,It gets even more interesting with each series.  The drama amongst the family is intriguing.  Staff also has their ups and downs to keep us gravitating back to watch.,1370908800,,166,4.689655172413793

We meet them as Germany is  well into its fanatical surrender to the Nazis and the cruel insanity that led to the Final Solution . Yet England continues to contort  itself to avoid the inevitable. The cast upstairs and down are excellent. But there is too much emphasis on the most flawed character, and for me, that distracts from the series.  But still I enjoyed watching it and recommend it.",1370649600,,500,4.584269662921348

5231337,5,B0090XUARQ,"I must admit, I thought the 1st season was lacking in depth, partly because there were too few episodes to get to know the characters.  The 2nd season fleshed them out and I really grew to like (or dislike) them.  The series held my interest and I was very sad to learn that they cancelled the show.  Acting was superb.  And there's something about a British accent that just gives everyone an extra dash of class!

The characters we fell in love with during season 1 are unbearably human and all show their ugly sides as the show progresses.  My only complaint is that the show ends on a terribly negative note but without another season to look forward to, there is no way to redeem the situation.  Overall, a wonderful British drama.

There were 3 seasons listed, and was eager to begin Season 3 but much to my surprise it is a different time-set, different actors, different everything - which left us hanging without any ending to Season 2!

5231374,4,B0090XUARQ,"I never watched the older series so I didn't have any nostalgia coming in to this show. There was kind of a slow start, but by the end of the second episode I was hooked. Turned into kind of a TV binge. But it was very entertaining and enjoyable. It's kind of similar to Downton Abbey, which I love. It was a good alternative during this off-season.

I think the most intriguing character is Lady Percy. She really changes and it's interesting to see her character arc. The main star Keeley is great... I liked her better on MI-5 though!

Overall, it was a great show. I really missed seeing Ivy from the first season. I was really curious to see where her character would end up. She was a firecracker and an unusual find.

I enjoyed the Blanche story line. It's awesome that now, with more liberal media, we get to see the gay story lines that didn't really get to exist in older period pieces, but obviously existed in real life! Her story was really fascinating and a little tragic.

Now I want to watch the original! I love British tv!

Also, even though I would have loved to see another season, I think what's great about the Brits is that they know when to end a show. If this was an American show it might have had like a billion seasons (if it was popular). I'm not sure anything else needed to be done with these characters. And they left off at a good point.",1369180800,3,1370,4.294573643410852

5231382,5,B0090XUARQ,"I just love almost all of  Masterpiece Theatre. Its a perfect soap opera fantasy for me, although I feel sure this family was very unique in their compassion and egalitarianism.  I think it had the right blend of innocence, sophistication with a good amount of  scandal and sordidness for an engaging mini series, and the actors were great, especially Maggie Smith.  However, at times it became rather irksome to watch a few of the servants so in awe of their ""masters"".  It doesn't seem very realistic that they would become so enmeshed in each others lives. And the snobbery of one of the servants seems a tad absurd. Also that the wife could not see through her ladies maid made her appear rather dense.  I wonder what they would have done if they had discovered she caused her to fall, thus aborting the baby.  As far as I would be concerned, she could swing for that.  That its the sign of a good drama I suppose, when one can identify with the characters. Not Madame Bovary but fun and a bit of a guilty pleasure.",1368748800,,1019,4.47027027027027

5231385,5,B0090XUARQ,"Let me make it clear that I have been a huge fan of Upstairs Downstairs since Masterpiece Theater broadcast it on PBS when all of us were younger. Instantly I became and remain a Jean Marsh fan, To see the co-creator performing on her series was a delight. Later I obtained copies of the U/D early series produced in B&W and not originally shown on PBS. I think that was a major mistake, because I enjoy every episode.

So all these years later I was delighted Jean Marsh would appear in a new U/D series set in the same house just before WWII. I bought that set and watch it often.

Somehow I did not see any of Season 2 when it was broadcast, so I was thrilled when Amazon offered the set, which I bought. I find Season 2 as entertaining as all the other Upstairs Downstairs episodes of the years.",1368662400,,799,4.25

5231390,3,B0090XUARQ,"I think I would have liked it better had there not been gaps in the story line between the first and second seasons. When the first episode started, I thought maybe I had missed one from the previous season or didn't remember some things that had happened. It wasn't until I kept watching that things were revealed, such as where Mrs. Buck went. There was no indication at the end of the last season that she was sick. Same thing with the second child that was born. I also felt like the attitude(s) towards the lesbian relationship were a little too modern for the time period in which this was set. I may be wrong, but I thought that issue was a little taboo. Otherwise, it was good. Downtown Abbey is better.",1368489600,,711,4.393939393939394

5231410,5,B0090XUARQ,I love the cliff hangers but more so the finished story.  I Can't wait to watch season 3.  must see,1367452800,,99,3.9
5231411,4,B0090XUARQ,I felt season 2 picked up well and was more interesting than Season1 but I have to say nothing about this is as excellent at Downton Abbey.,1367366400,,139,4.185185185185185

5231415,5,B0090XUARQ,"This series has really caught the attention of many viewers.  So I decided to watch the first season, and was I ever hooked.  I love the way the characters interact.  I have also learned much about that period in history where the ""class"" difference is demonstrated, and yet there is really a tenderness that weaves them together.  I can't wait for the next season to start.  It's kind of fun to watch as many episodes as  you want in one sitting and not have to wait from week to week.",1367107200,,486,4.344444444444444

5231417,5,B0090XUARQ,I think this season is even better than the first. The undercurrent of WWII makes it really interesting. I love that the Kindertransport is included - I feel like a lot of history courses in the US gloss over it (never heard of it until college). The characters are generally strong. I especially like Mr. Amanjeet. Every show needs a great villain and this show has one. Generally I enjoyed this very much.,1367107200,,407,4.589041095890411

5231423,3,B0090XUARQ,"The first season left you with a longing for more.  The characters seemed somewhat in line with the original.  Even though the ""senior"" characters may 'trip' they always upheld a sense of dignity.  Lord Hallum's continued affair with his sister-in-law and Mr. Prichard's drunkardness were both just sad (You would never find Lord Bellemy or Mr. Hudson  acting as such - nor would you find the Lords Granthum in such a storyline).  Plus it didn't help when Jean Marsh took ill and they killed off Eileen Atkins.  Finally, the story lines were somewhat scattered.",1366761600,,561,4.914893617021277
5231424,3,B0090XUARQ,"After watching Downton Abbey, and reviewing the original Upstairs Downstairs from the 70's, I thought this was just o.k. by comparison.  There did not seem to be a central character that I wanted to cheer on, and I felt that the departure of Jean Marsh made it less connected to the original.  There did not seem to be a real tight bond between the folks who lived Downstairs, and there was too much hanky panky going on Upstairs to make me like any of them.  Not until the last episode did it all come together, and getting there seemed so tedious.  Nontheless, I loved the costumes and the set.  The old fashioned looking cars were awesome!  I appreciated the conflict between the driver and the master of the house, and I adored Beryl.  Mr. Pritchard was a real surprise and I was happy he redemmed himself in the end.  I would view season 3, if there were one, seemed like it was just warming up!",1366761600,,900,4.412121212121212

Having watched almost all of the original Upstairs/Downstairs on PBS when it first came to the states, I picked up the new updated version and I can say it's even more entertaining than the original.

5231438,5,B0090XUARQ,"While it was set in the same house & street, the stories, characters and time period makes it a darker story, the period leading up to WW2, it's a good history for people who were not born before 1950, those who were born before it's a re-telling of what we remember.",1366329600,,267,4.254901960784314

5231452,5,B0090XUARQ,"Purchased both seasons of this continuing story of '165' while I am waiting for the next season of Downton Abby.  I have never seen the original series so I was not certain if jumping in now would be confusing, but it is not, the story does a nice job of looping back to explain any references to the original series making it easy on viewers like me.  I cannot compare this series to the original, but that might be a good thing, allowing this series to stand on its own merits.  The characters are easy to warm up to, and the story line moves along at a nice pace.  This is proving to be a nice filler and I am going to be sorry to see it end so quickly.  If you are looking for some enjoyable viewing similar to Downton then you will most likely find this series fits the bill nicely.",1365206400,,787,4.117647058823529

5231455,2,B0090XUARQ,"The first series remake of the old 1970s series was a workable redo with decent acting, especially since the original Rose from the old series became a staple of the new as the new housekeeper.  However, the second series just flamed out into a vehicle for promotion of liberal agenda items, including a lesbian affair between the main character husband's aunt and her married friend - married to a guy who she is cheating on with the aunt - as well as promoting an affair between the husband and his sister in law who he already knew had a lot of 'baggage' and which was pretty distasteful all around.  The acting, as usual superb by the usual British miniseries/tv talent, can't quite save this poor second series.  The same gal who wrote both 'new' series also wrote Call the Midwife which I just viewed the first season on Netflix - which also had a nice little liberal gospel preaching of 'incest is just fine and dandy as long as it's a hardship case involved' (brother and sister who had been in the workhouse together) and ""suicide is ok too"" - both things endorsed by the Anglican nuns who take to chewing out the nurses who are grossed out by the incest as being morally ""backward"" and ""intolerant.""  So, if you are in the mood for things of this sort then this is the show for you.",1364688000,6,1292,4.461864406779661

5231459,4,B0090XUARQ,There seems little to like in the character of Hallum. He is pompous and blames everyone else for his failings. Most characters who gain interest are a mixture of traits. There nothing to endear us to either Hallum or Percy. I missed the explanation for the disappearance of the first house maid in the second season. It seems to be unraveling somewhat. Hallums mother died and that is the end. No explanation although she was a very strong character and one with a some substance and explanation. I like the maturation of Agnes who continues to grow while few upstairs do. The aunt is a good character but comes and goes . its hard not to like all of the downstairs people. I love a good underdog of course but......................,1363996800,2,733,4.6461538461538465

5231461,3,B0090XUARQ,"Season was was really good - and without spilling too many details, season 2 reaches for the over-dramatic, out-of-character behaviors that really frustrate the viewer, and server only to create an artificial sense of heightened tension and drama.  Would recommend watching this if you generally like period pieces and the historical context, or if you really enjoyed season 1 and want to see the continuation, even if it's silly.
All the aesthetic components are top notch- just like in season 1.  The shots, the style, the lighting, the immersion into the period piece, all this is top notch.  The acting is great also, it's just that the characters have ridiculous parts to play to entice viewers to keep watching, which, ironically, makes some viewers (me) wish they had reached for higher plot standards.",1363737600,,809,5.067669172932331

Good characters but none we -my wife and I- find as compelling nor endearing as Downton.
More emphasis on the Worker's than the Aristocrats , but that's not all bad as most of the Upstairs characters are not very likeable!
In all fairness, Downton is SO good and we saw it first, so UpDown suffers by comparison.

5231466,4,B0090XUARQ,What can you say about British acting? They are always the best. This is a fun one to watch with the wife.

5231467,3,B0090XUARQ,"While this series is mildly entertaining, the only thing it shares with Downton Abbey is a series of plot elements.  The production values and the quality of the acting are both admirable, but the writing is exceptionally poor.

5231475,5,B0090XUARQ,"Life at Eaton Place 165 would seem to be calming down but that is not the case.  This season brings forth multiple changes in the relationships in the family, the threat of WW II and issues within the staff of the home.

Tremendous pressures are being put onto Hallam's shoulders with the threat of war and his efforts to prepare the British government and help to try to prevent the war.  Those pressures are affecting his family, his job and his well-being.

I won't go into the season's details any more as many reviewers have already posted too many spoilers.  Let's just say that the story line is gripping and interesting and you will gain a lot of insights into prewar England and the life of the aristocrats in the government.  The details about the lives of the servants are also a major part of the story and their life is vastly different than that of their wealthy bosses.

I really like this series and I am becoming addicted to British television drama.  At the present time the shows offered by the BBC are so much better than what is available from the American TV channels.  The acting on this series is excellent and the story lines and dialog are interesting.  I love the contrast between the rich and the servants and it provides an insight into the lives of the common English person and the wealthy.

This is an excellent show and it is a combination soap opera and a drama combined.  I really like this season and I recommend it to you.

But these two seasons that they tried to restart in 2010 (?) are indicative of what's happened to a lot of TV.  It's all about who's sleeping with who, etc., like a giant soap opera.  The first set was actually about the servants downstairs and the masters upstairs.  This seemed to stay pretty much upstairs and was therefore not well-rounded.  It seemed apt though, as they don't really seem to like the servants having sex.  LOL",1361836800,,540,4.572916666666667

5231483,4,B0090XUARQ,Season 2 is definitely better than season 1. Seems to have more going on with the characters. Season one was a littel slow I thought.,1361577600,,133,4.36
5231484,5,B0090XUARQ,"As a passionate Downton Abbey fan, I loved being able to sit and watch as many segments as I wanted, rather than having to wait a week for the next. BUT, I hated to see death of a major character. I watch Downton A. as an escape from reality. I have enough pain in my life without sniffling through the pain of a character I've become attached to. Julian Fellowes kills off characters when they have to leave the show. I wish he'd come up with a better solution. As usual, the set and costumes are amazing and provide a great education into that period. Entertaining way to learn history.",1361491200,,588,4.3545454545454545

I don't get it as it seems a lot of people really liked this series on Amazon but the BBC cancelled due to disappointing ratings.

This series is about individual lives within two different classes.  The Upstairs class is wealthy, wardrobed superbly and each person unique and interesting.  Downstairs holds the lives of people committed to serving the Upstairs.  There is tension within each class and across classes which makes for an interesting story.  The writers did an amazing job of making each person a true individual (tapping into how human they truly are).  This is not a story about servants being belittled by their masters rather it's a touching story of the love that exists between the two classes and the unseamingly way they all exist under the same roof.",1358812800,,809,4.818840579710145

The new UPSTAIRS was in production some time BEFORE Downton went into production. It's just that Downton IS a better realized show. *sigh* BUT, this series has Keeley Hawes! Gawrsh...guess who I'm a fan of. Think about it...you only get one guess. Okay. I really like this show. Nice period feel, costumes and cast, etc. However, series two is more soap opera than series one and it suffers as a result. Ends with a mild cliffhanger, but don't hold your ,breath. It won't be coming back. Why five stars? C'mon...I said ONE guess. 'Nuff said.",1358380800,,667,4.859649122807017

The new Upstairs Downstairs is so delicious, I was forced to realize that Downton Abbey in its third season is getting stale. It also became painfully apparent that Downton Abbey is almost a complete rip off of Upstairs Downstairs, which is baffling to me because had the series been based on the true story of the real ""Downtown Abbey,"" (Highclare Park?) it would have been excellent. However the true story does not focus on the primogeniture plot so popular these days (there were male heirs) but on the real ""Lady Grantham,"" who was a sadly overlooked role model for her time. Come on PBS. Did you really deserve all those Emmys?",1357689600,,780,4.785185185185185

5231595,5,B0090XUARQ,"I enjoy stories that use a historical backdrop and this is definitely one. The characters are interesting and their struggles no matter the class keep hold of your attention. Yes, this is a story of classes. It shows the great devide between upstairs and downstairs. It also shows the devisions that separate the servants. Examples are ethinicity, religion, military service as well as Butler vs housekeeper vs cook. Then there is first born male vs second and third. Women vs men and so forth.

The story is set right before the start of WW11. It strives to show what one family faced during those troubled times. In my opinion the production deserves high marks. I thouroughly enjoyed it and will watch the 2013 season if it is produced.

5231621,5,B0090XUARQ,"This series is so well done and acted I have to rate it as highly as possible because it is the equal of the first series way back when, of which I was a huge fan, in most respects.
This cast of characters is just as sprawling in its compressed way and involving.
I don't know if the last episodes reflect a knowledge that the whole production was going to be cancelled and therefore all the loose ends needed to be ""resolved"" to the extent possible, and too suddenly by necessity.
Perhaps that is why these later events all seem to collapse into shocking conclusions that cry for further development.
Persee of course is the tragic figure in all of this, but one can't help but imagine how much better the series could have been if this aspect of the story didn't have to end so abruptly.
What elegance though and what a shame it probably got squeezed out by Downton Abbey.
In the end all the compelling subplots could have been explored more deeply if the series had just been allowed to go on.
I hope popular demand brings it back some day.",1352937600,3,1043,4.381443298969073
5231622,3,B0090XUARQ,"165 Eaton Place is best known for the long-standing television series that began in the 1970's. Two years ago, the BBC revived interest in it by opening up the house and introducing audiences to the Holland family. This go-around, there's more angst, more romance, and much more scandal in the offering.

Six episodes leaves this series more room to breathe, but unfortunately along with it comes certain complications. I found it difficult in the series' infancy to like most of the characters and this follow-up doesn't change that, although it does a fine job of begging compassion now and again. The best move it makes is to introduce Blanche but even her presence isn't without its issues. (The irony of Alex Kingston playing yet another archeologist/professor is not lost on me.) The truly sad thing is that after being the hero of the story in the first season, a main character becomes a cheating husband. The new maid is lovely, and we do get to explore some of the precursor nuances of the war. Overall, the series is forgettable in addition to its disappointing twists and turns.",1352764800,11,1090,4.828877005347594
5231623,2,B0090XUARQ,"(Spoilers, I'm afraid, for this one.) I really did enjoy Season One, even more than Downtown Abbey, which was its main competitor. But oh my sainted aunt; oh my paws and whiskers! What DID they do with Season Two? The characters are simply unrecongizable and the narrative goes from realistically uplifting to quite unbelievable trash.

Hallum changes, with no warning, from a noble person with brilliant international insights to an idiot so enslaved to his nether regions that he sleeps with his sister-in-law and allows her to extract information for the Nazis, toward whom she is still sympathetic; Percy goes from being an understandably confused and spoiled adolescent to practically a psychopath. When it finally looks like Pritchard, that kind man, finds love, it is ripped away and he descends into alcoholism; the driver, who had rejected his Nazi leanings, now becomes a blackmailer and potential deserter; Beryl, who had begun to respect her mistress for her better understanding of the servants' situation, turns spiteful. And Eileen Atkins, alas, is put on the shelf (literally) and replaced by her sister--a very sensible, endearing, and wise woman, who, it is clearly implied, has romantic preferences for her own gender (stereotypically very male clothing, etc). Hardly unusual, but here it has to be drawn out and detailed explicitly with a lost lover and a bedroom scene or two. With all this, throw in a botched abortion, equally detailed, and the series becomes, as Lady Agnes puts is so succinctly in the end, ""a sordid affair."" Not that these issues should have been ignored, but it seems a great deal of valuable narrative time was was wasted on drawing them out melodramatically as a suddenly major focus--while viewers, I suspect, were wondering how the children refugees were doing, the step-daughter at school, etc., all of which were just dropped.

Johnny, the likable footman lad, and the sweet housemaid with glasses, seem to be the only two who stay their kind and believeable selves (though Johnny is listed as 1-A for conscription, so of course such a good-hearted and outdated character will be killed in the war), along with Hallum's disabled sister, who makes a couple of charming appearances. At least the Indian manservant and the cook stay sensibly level-headed, while everyone else devolves into raving bonkers and you wonder if they will all be carted off to Bedlam Hospital. Agnes, in the end, decides, unselfishly, for the sake of the children and her household, to stay with her husband; but her love for Hallum, now esquery for the Duke of Kent after resigning his position at Whitehall, is extinquished.

The last scene, with guns, attempted murder, and suicide--all neatly swept up by the returning Pritchard with an amazing lack of emotion for what has just happened--approaches farce; and is such a sad contrast to the first scene in the series, where the children's refugee home is established. The very fact that a viewer can actually sit through this second series until the end is due entirely to the truly brilliant actors, who had very little material to work with. It is almost as if the scriptwriters were taking their revenge for the series not being continued. Poor Jean Marsh; they really ruined her revival in Series Two. We wish her the very best in her recovery from her stroke, but I doubt the second series will help. She is a genius; these writers were, alas, not.",1352678400,19,3431,4.984293193717278
5231624,2,B0090XUARQ,"I had hoped for some depth of discussion about the changing roles of upper and lower classes in the aftermath of WWI, the 'roaring' 20s, and the Great Depression.  The characters were all there - ambitious nursery maid and chauffeur, Indian well-educated secretary cum downstairs nobody, brilliant independent upperclass woman still harassed for not being married, etc. But instead we got a soapy sisters' act, with Agnes and Persie being the unfortunate center for most of the series.  Even that wouldn't have been so bad if the writers had made the two sisters consistent characters.  But within one episode Lady Agnes shifts from careless selfish employer to rousing civic leader to whining wife.  And Persie shifts from drunken slut to loving mistress and then jealous hussy.  Hallam turns out to be a weak-willed selfish little twit, telling others what their 'duty' is but doing whatever he wants and treating everyone as servants - including his wife and aunt.  No one is the rock-solid moral center of this series, and it needs it.  There simply wasn't a strong guiding hand in this second series.  Other than the family name and the address of the house, I saw nothing to connect this series with the earlier successful one.",1352073600,14,1233,4.951456310679611
5231625,5,B0090XUARQ,"The new 2012 UP/Down series two finally. Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s and continues in 2 the new episodes, more like a cameo. Beware of confusion, the only difference between the old title and the new is the current series is missing the comma. 6 episodes advance the story in season 2. Much of the cast returns including Marsh, but not Eileen Atkins. You get the same house and music as the 1970s epic blockbuster and seasons of the modern continuation. Yet it progresses as a costume period drama, and in my opinion at the entertainment level of the standards set in the 1970s.

No disappointment from me or my wife with 2010's 3 episodes or this season's additional 6. The current cast is believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house gives old fans past memories, even though the interior was redecorated to 1930's. I fell in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165, just like I do with watching the old series. Both excellent casts.

This series begins on the eve of WWII, 1938 a year ahead, but it's evident that war is certain. There is drama galore in the every day affairs, and I do mean affairs, of those society's family, as well as their house staff.

This set includes huge stars making their own world-wide fame Upstairs and Downstairs. Of course Marsh. Maude (Dame Atkins) has died, sad not to see her return, but the cast is still excellent, and Atkins was never in any of the 1970s series.  Keeley Hawes, great as the Lady Agnes; Ed Stoppard as Sir Hallam, Neil Jackson, Claire Foy, Anne Reid (marvelous as the cook), Adrian Scarborough, Art Malik, & Blake Ritson each return in every episode  Alex Kingston is new to UD and in 5 episodes while Laura Haddock and Amy Metcalf newly appear in all 2012 episodes. Kingston and Haddock provide stellar performances upping the already fine level of acting on this series. Humor at time, mystery or suspense at others, romance, drama of course, & always entertaining. It's a keeper--proving to be as good as the original.

SUBTITLES provided for all 6 2012 episodes.
1 A Faraway Country About Which We Know Nothing.....
Maude died & Blanche (Kingston) moves into 165 Eaton Place. War seems certain & EP does it's part to prepare. Disagreement over white feathers (CO).

5231626,5,B0090XUARQ,"Not only were people in the thirties waiting for the catastrophic 'other shoe to drop' (a psychological state I am gaining more experience of and empathy for given current events) but they were also faced with sweeping social changes in virtually every level of life. Servants now had some recourse when conditions were bad and as the pool of available domestic help shrunk to meet war production the servant class would have ever more power and would ultimately disappear forever. Other minorities were less silent and hidden as well, in the case of this episode, lesbians, or the brilliant use of the old-fashioned term, inverts. Women also had a little more power over their bodies, though as we see, not yet enough to be safe.

Social conservatives will hate this episode with its themes of lesbian love, abortion and upward social mobility, but Upstairs Downstairs handles all of these in interesting plot lines and in ways that are true to the times. The love story is affecting and well done. Also emotionally affecting is the plight of the Jewish refugees and the way that both government and individuals moved to cope with it. All of these show people being both noble and venal and that is what makes this such a strong show. Recommended - especially to fans of costume drama and the history of 1933 to 1945.",1351123200,,1318,4.780701754385965

After watching season one of the new update, other than Eileen Atkins' absolutely stellar  performance, I found season 1 to be rather disappointing in terms of the script. So, I was disheartened to learn that Ms. Atkins would not be returning to star in season 2, due to a disagreement with the turn the scripts were taking.

Well, Ms. Atkins was correct in her assessment. Despite excellent performances by the talented cast, the scripts were leaden and lacking incoherent storytelling or any  real character development. In fact, many of the characters were not particularly likable. To add insult to injury, the script was laden with twenty first century social mores overlaid on a 1930s England. This served up a total lack of  authenticity of time and place, despite the beautiful sets.

The sister, Percy, is a viper; a miserable Nazi intent on ruining others happiness; and the husband, Hallam, is a self-righteous prig who - like most self-righteous people - is a hypocrite.
There is a lot of drama, and a lot of things that don't make sense in this season which made it frustrating to watch and made me grateful for its end.  In addition to the story of the fictional characters, the use of a historical personage as Hallams best friend also became confusing because the writers seem more interested in using Prince George to forward Hallam's story rather than in depicting the truth of Prince Georges life.",1524700800,,818,4.713286713286713
8533591,1,B0090XUARQ,"How sad that they took SUCH a good show and turned it to trash in the second season. I can't go any further than the 4th episode and should have stopped at the first. The richness of the main characters from season was quickly diminished when they let go of Rose and the mother, but then they stripped the other main characters of their morals in ways that didn't seem fitting or consistentto their characters at all. It was like watching different people. Poor plot writing and character development (or should I say ""destruction)

My guess is that the high rating for the 2nd season is a bunch of reviews trickling in from the 1st season.",1524355200,,640,4.517241379310345
8533592,2,B0090XUARQ,"Really liked Season One. Season 2 started off fine, with 2 pretty good episodes--enough really good stuff to offset the silly. Then it all went to hell. Different writers? Stupid soap opera plots. Unwatchable. No wonder viewership dropped and it was cancelled.",1521936000,,260,5.214285714285714
