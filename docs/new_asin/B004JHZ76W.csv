I watched it the night the film premiered in Los Angeles; I recommend to my family but they couldn't watch since they live on the East Coast.  If you're reading this review PBS, please make sure to air this documentary on ALL OF YOUR AFFILIATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY!!!",1295740800,2,316,4.526315789473684

On a personal level, I love historical documentaries and this one, in the vein of the Ken Burns Civil War series, really shed light on the history of Los Angeles in an informative, concise, and entertaining way. As much as I love the big epic historical documentaries it was so refreshing to watch something that took a more micro approach and brought us right down to a single family and its history from the Spanish settlement in California, to the transfer of land to Mexico, and finally the United States and the modern era.

 In a classroom, it's a great way to show students just how the area in which they lived was shaped, the depth of history that is behind a name like ""Dominguez"".  Most people never know about the generations and centuries that make up the streets you drive and the communities in which you live.  It enriches the student's experience, provided for a fantastic discussion tool, and a great foundation for local history assignments.  On a personal note, its made me so much more aware of Los Angeles as a living, breathing historical city.

I love knowing the role of the Dominguez family in the growth of Los Angeles. I hope they continue to make more like this! A finely crafted film!",1295740800,,1452,4.626459143968872
