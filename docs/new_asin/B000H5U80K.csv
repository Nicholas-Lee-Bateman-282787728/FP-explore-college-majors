I like that they did not use professional players to demonstrate the principles. These players are learning like we are learning. After watching this and the Beat the Baseliner dvd I beat several players I thought were out of my league. I did not practice more, I just had a much better game plan for these types of players. You can't ask for more than that. I started winning with my mind. It was so nice to have a game plan. No doubts or wondering, the game became more simple for me. That you Tennis Magazine and Paul Annacone (coach for Sampras and Federer)! For $25 I got a thousand dollars of value.",1326412800,,734,4.212765957446808

8136727,1,B000H5U80K,"This DVD has a disclaimer sticker on it which states that once open, it cannot be returned.  That is your indication that you should not proceed.  The instructions, suggestions, and even the players in the DVD are terrible..  The players themselves cannot execute the instructions.  I've played tennis for years, and this DVD is not suitable for beginners, intermediate or advanced players.  It is totally useless.  It is shameful that it is being sold. Also, I am forced to enter at least a ""1 Star"" rating.  That is too high.",1183420800,3,527,4.788888888888889
