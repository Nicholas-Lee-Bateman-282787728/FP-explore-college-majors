I thought it was a enjoyable movie that was better than your average horror movie.",1441584000,2,250,4.456521739130435
7385379,4,B0147OOWMQ,"Creepy is the best and most appropriate word to describe this movie.  I give it 4 stars not because it is an amazing movie, but because it is an amazing movie if you are sitting with the right person.  My movie date gets very frightened and that makes this a blast!  I have to admit a couple scenes made me jump as well.  It is hard to get good movies in this genre, and so much is rehashed and repetitive.  Not that different in this movie, but it is executed well, and it works.

Setting is excellent, a farm in Illinois, where I wouldn't dare set foot, and the two young actors as the twins do an admirable job.

Cast is decent:: James Ransone, Shannyn Sossamon, Robert Sloan, Dartanian Sloan and Lea Coco - but you will notice the missing star power of an Ethan Hawke.
Director: Ciaran Foy

Worth seeing, make sure to see it late at night.  It is quite spooky, and they have done an excellent job creating a 'multi-sensorial' experience.",1440979200,23,941,4.362068965517241
7385380,5,B0147OOWMQ,"Just as scary and tense as the first one. Just seen it in theater today, excellent. I'm really enjoying this horror movie renaissance we've been going through with films like Insidious, Sinister, It Follows, Mama, even the Paranormal Activities are enjoyable.",1440720000,2,259,5.341463414634147
7385381,5,B0147OOWMQ,"Nine Things About the Film ""Sinister 2""

1. This feverish experience is one of the best horror films of the year.

2. You don't have to see the first movie to see this one, but I highly recommend it. The context of the film won't make a lot of sense without it. And part of the intensity of this movie is because you know the secret, but the people in the movie don't.

3. It follows Deputy So & So after the events of the first film. Obsessed with stopping Bughuul, he comes across a woman with two sons who have unkowingly attracted the pagan deity. While the mother deals with her ex-husband, dead kids appear to one of the boys and show him snuff films in the basement (if the snuff films in the first movie bothered you, you should know that these are worse).

4. As with the first movie, the use of sound in this film is an experience in itself, expertly cutting together music and effects to heighten the hallucinatory nature of what's going on.

5. In a super rare occurrence for a horror film, there is actually a second plot line. I mean, this is like a real movie. While some will be annoyed by the extra story because it takes away from the supernatural stuff, it's a great development that makes the characters real people, so that you actually care what happens to them. It's also a grim reminder that some things in real life are just as scary as a ghost.

6. The movie quickly but cleverly uses an obscure, but actually real, phenomenon known as ""numbers stations"" to give a greater scope to Bughuul's actions.

7. There are some good jump scares in the movie. But the filmmakers know the difference between a ""scary movie"" and a ""horror movie"". By making the film rated R, they gave up some viewers that would have seen it if it were PG-13. They use that harder rating to their full advantage, making this an actual horror film. This movie is NOT for kids.

8. There is a quick, easy-to-miss conversation between two characters that bring up the idea of ""aesthetic observation of violence."" If you want to get all meta, you can apply that concept to the movie you're watching, and get some uncomfortable insights into the nature of horror itself.

9. If you like your horror movies to be the flash-bang generic type, like ""The Conjuring"", then this film may not be your thing. But if you want your horror movies to mean something, to stick with you, and even make you genuinely uncomfortable, then you owe it to both yourself and the horror genre to watch this film.",1440720000,44,2483,4.43956043956044
7385382,3,B0147OOWMQ,"I felt that this was a decent movie. It gave a little more insight as
to what was going on with those videotapes from part one and more
insight as to what the ""Sinister"" entity is all about. But if
definitely had some very slow parts too. Around the middle, I found
myself wanting the movie to pick up its pace. . I say that if you are a
huge fan of ""Sinister"" 1 like me, this may be an interesting addition
to the franchise, but if you are new to it or looking for something
really scary, you may want to rent this movie before buying it... The movie
was not that bad. It had some disturbing scenes, but I can't say that
it was awesome either.",1440460800,,644,4.0390625

7385394,5,B0147OOWMQ,"Sinister 2 is one of every inferior horror sequels that deserves to be given a second chance. The writers of the original came up of a well thought out story that takes place after Sinister and took everything from there to make this film a fleshed out sequel that exceeds the original in the right places. The farmhouse setting bring out the creep factor head on throughout the film and the opening brought me a little deja vu from the first movie. The film works as a sequel that stays perfectly true to the original to a great measure.

Each shot is set up well.  Good miss-en-scene, good editing, and good acting.  The screenplay and like of a coherent narrative are the main problem.  Funny post-Exorcist scene with a priest in a confessional near the start of the film. Woman who was in Weyward Pines and A Knight's Tale plays a single Mom.

7385422,4,B0147OOWMQ,"A decent sequel, continuing the Bughuul saga. I'd like to know where Bughuul gets his unlimited supply of anachronistic media. It's difficult to get 16mm film and cameras where I live. Heck, you can't even buy a Polaroid these days. Luckily, the resurgence of vinyl LPs has allowed our demon to maintain his collection for his antique gramophone, and he's extremely old-school about using a lathe to record the horrific sounds. He's like a hipster, almost; an artisan boogieman who plays guitar for Skipknot in his spare time. Probably.

This isn't a film that's going to give anyone nightmares, even with a plethora of disturbing families-being-murdered home movies. But definitely watchable if supernatural horror is your thing.",1478822400,3,730,5.239316239316239

7385431,3,B0147OOWMQ,Ok first of all... This movie is fun. Spooky and set to give you thrills. But compare to the first I wouldn't say it's bad I would put it like this ..the first was made to scare and creep out adults. The second one seemed watered down to give young children or teens a scare. The bogey man in this one was not so sinister as in the first. It's as if I seen a great horror movie and turned it into a campfire story for kids. But I did enjoy it. Worth a view. I collect horror movies and would j add this to the collection? Yes if it was on sale for 5.00 dollars or a gift. If you like horror movies you won't go wrong with this. But if like me and you seen every horror movie .... Will pretty much guess the scenes before hand.,1474243200,,726,3.879194630872483

This movie even scared my fiance and made his mom jump at parts. I loved the idea of adding a ham radio into the mix. My dad is a long time ham radio operator and it amazed me that they added something like that into the movie. The basic idea of this movie is a family trying to stay as far away from the two boys' highly abusive controlling father while hiding out at the newest home of the dreaded demon that possesses the film projector. As the battle of the mother keeping her boys safe from the father intenses, so too does the demon's powers. Deputy So-and-So tracks down the demon to the house and ends up befriending the mother and her sons. Ironically, one boy is sweet and shy like his mother while the other turns into his father. Like the first movie, the more you watch, the more danger you get thrown into. I'd recommend this movie to horror lovers everywhere.",1468972800,6,1005,4.294736842105263

A 12 year old kid cuts off your hand, so you break his camera, but leave the scythe next to him? And a game of ghostly hide and seek? Oooh. Scary. Just....ugh. There is nothing to redeem this film.

7385459,4,B0147OOWMQ,"I really enjoyed Sinister, so I figured I would give the sequel a whirl. Even though I already knew what was driving the children to do such horrible acts, Sinister 2 was still very enjoyable.

There is something about children, who are evil, that really freaks me out. And I think a lot of people feel this way. Thats why when that plot device is used in a horror movie, its so effective. Everytime I saw the clips of people being killed in a corn field, I would think of The Children of the Corn series. I still cant drive past a corn field without staring into to make sure theres no children watching me. And living in Wisconsin, I pass a lot of corn fields.

Sinister 2 was a well made slasher movie, with some gore, and a major creep factor thrown in because of the children. No need to have watched the first one, but if you did, and enjoyed it, then you should like this one as well.",1458864000,,891,4.204678362573099

7385461,5,B0147OOWMQ,Refreshing storyline from the usual scary movies out lately. The demon in here is truly frightening,1458518400,,99,5.25
7385462,5,B0147OOWMQ,"If you haven't seen the first Sinister, you may not want to read the rest of the review; it's hard to avoid giving spoilers to the previous movie.  Suffice it to say the first one was great and this one is even better.  For those who have seen the first one, however:

Picking up several years after the massacre of the Oswalt family, Sinister 2 finds Ellison Oswalt's former info source at the police station, (James Ransome) now off the force and systematically tracking down houses where the demon Bughuul (Nick King) has struck, burning them to the ground to prevent any new families from moving in and falling prey to Bughuul.  Meanwhile, young mother Courtney (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two young sons Dylan and Zachary (Robert Sloan and Dartanian Sloan) are on the run from the abusive father of the family.  They find a vacant house to lay low in for a while, but this turns out to be one of the places where Bhughuul previously manifested.  By the time the former deputy arrives and tries to help the family make a clean break from the husband/father, the haunting of Bughuul and the missing children has already started, though this is known only to Dylan and Zachary.

Having two very dark plotlines - the Bughuul hauntings and the domestic abuse storyline - running paralell to each other, and later converging, makes for a very intense and frightening film.  Bughuul is emerging as one of the best horror villains in a long time, and Courtney's husband Clint (Lea Coco) is all too believable as the non-supernatural antagonist.  All in all, one of 2015's best.",1458345600,,1573,4.711678832116788
7385463,1,B0147OOWMQ,"How can I not compare Sinister 2 to Sinister? I really wanted to like this movie, sorry I didn't. I thought it was lacking that creepy, haunted feel like the first movie. The storyline was so basic, mom running from abusive husband with her two sons. She escapes to a old farm house with a church directly in the backyard, which she is aware a horrible murder scene took place. Her farm house is haunted, kids start acting weird, a strange man arrives she invites him in and they end up falling for each other?!? This movie was so not scary, it could have been a movie on Syfy or Chiller, so not scary. This movie wasn't even half way scary ..",1458000000,3,643,4.278688524590164

I get that kids can be jealous, but it's a real stretch, in my opinion, to convince that one twin would murder his brother, and his mom, out of jealousy. I just didn't find that motivator believable and as that was the main motivator, didn't find the story persuasive, so didn't work for me. To support the jealousy argument writer should've made the mom favor one twin over the jealous one, something like that might've worked better. skipped around abit so if film did that, I missed it.",1457568000,,679,4.573770491803279

7385474,4,B0147OOWMQ,"While I did like the original, the sequel could have done way better that what they delivered on. Because it's a really interesting idea, because now we get to see how the children get corrupted into killing their families.
There was also some flaws and I'll get into that towards the end.
So from what we know from the first, is that he some how gets to the kids and corrupts one of them and convinces them to kill their whole family in some ritualistic fashion by drugging them while catching it on film.
So the sequel, follows a mother trying to hide herself and two boys from her abusive husband and the custody battle. We also meet up from the cop from the first, and see that he took on the roll of a P.I. and investing his time trying to find houses that have been cursed and burn them down. Which is how he meets this family.
The film, felt a little rushed in my opinion. I mean, it's building so much on the back story of why the wife left, why she ran, what's going on with the former cop, he research behind it all, and so forth. It just... Wasn't needed, and we got the story before they even explained it. They've could have saved us the trouble of explaining it, and focused their time and energy of the corruption. However, the film still was a good watched and I highly recommend watching it. Owning it however, I don't. The film had to many flaws that left me rolling my eyes a little.

Spoilers and complaints so stop now.

First off, even if you buy the house, it's still illegal and very dangerous. You can't just light up your house, and say it's mine and I can burn it down. Even if you say you didn't do it, the large paper trail you leave behind of buying random houses across America and burning them down would lead an officer arresting you.
Second, why didn't he explain why he's there to the mother and why did the mother feel it was okay to just let a stranger walk around the whole place. I get why later when he saved the kids being taken away, but before she just felt it was okay? Back to why not tell her! If he truly didn't want her to leave, a simple, long conversation of the history behind the killings and why he's there would have kept her locked inside for good.
Third, pretty sure no 8-12 year old can survive being hit by a car. Even if they did, they wouldn't be able to run a chase people in the corn field.
Fourth, you have a perfectly good car that you used to slam into a killer child... Why pass it up to go run in the corn field when he starts to chase you?
Fifth, I liked it better when the dead kids were silent and scary. Kids should be seen, not heard or playing hide and seek and tossing stuff around when looking for a family to kill.
I will say, I like the idea for the ending. If you the child that's killing fail, you die and the second house burns down because it's no longer part of the chain. I mean, the whole thing is really going to be hard to explain legally. My 11 year old son just strung us up on a cross to burn us, killed my husband, attacked us with a knife, when he couldn't then the ghost came and killed him and burn the house down... Yeah that's how you get your kids taken away.",1455235200,,3155,4.136807817589577

7385481,3,B0147OOWMQ,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Its been said that when a sequel hits for any series of films that the second one always falls far short of the original. Most of that comes from the expectations of those going to see the movie, the fans of the first film who more often than not are no longer shocked, surprised or stunned by the things seen the first time around. Its a burden most second films in any franchise will suffer. For the second SINISTER film the movie isn't as bad as some sequels but still falls far short of the original.

Two storylines combine this time around. The first involves the deputy from the first film (identified as Deputy So & So in the credits), the deputy who was helping author Ellison Oswalt (Ethan Hawke) in the first film. The deputy has been following up on the clues left behind that Ellison had provided. Links as to why the events played out as they did, why select families were chosen, have been found and he is trying to end the murderous path discovered in the first film.

The second storyline involves a young mother named Courtney (Shannyn Sossamon) living in a secluded farm house with her two young sons. The boys seem like exact opposites with one named Zach a bit on the cruel side and the other, Dylan, a more sensitive youngster. It is Dylan who is approached by the wraith like children who were victims of Bughuul, the terrifying figure from the first movie. They convince him to watch their movies, movies where they are seen killing their families. How this will affect him down the line is yet to be seen.

The two stories come together when the deputy, no longer working as a law officer, coming to the farm house. It was the last location he has for occurrences that involved Bughuul, a ritualistic slaying of a religious family in the church building out back. Hes stunned to find a family living here having been told the building was vacant. Courtney explains that a friend of hers allowed her to use the place for the time being until she could find another. Shes hiding the reasons for her being there but doesnt reveal them just yet.

The movies continue to be seen and eventually the reason for Courtney and the boys staying there comes out. Her husband was an abusive jerk but highly influential with the locals politically and in law enforcement. The deputy steps in to prevent them from taking the boys using his knowledge of the law and the chance that it could blow back in their faces. This makes him an enemy of the husband and a potential love interest for Courtney.

As this unfolds the pressure is put on Dylan to watch the movies again and again. The wraiths are trying to get him to the point of watching the last film and then adding his to the collection. Interactions with the deputy may have him thinking twice. Or perhaps something else is going on here. With Bughuul behind it all the odds are something will happen.

As I said, the movie is well made, it looks good and the story line is actually fairly inventive. But at the same time having jumped and been startled by scenes in the first film they're more expected here and when they occur the jumps just aren't there. Thats a problem with jump films. The distractions used to make you feel safe no longer leave you feeling safe at any time and instead you know the jump is coming. It deadens the scares but still can make your skin crawl.

All in all this isn't a bad film and its sad that it will always be compared to the first. Im not sure if a sequel would be a good thing or if it should end with this chapter. My opinion is that it should. But Im sure that if the movie made enough money for a big return on investment the odds are that well see Bughuul again in the near future. The question is can he ever be scary again?",1453334400,,3792,4.3917378917378915

7385493,2,B0147OOWMQ,"Ugh.  Okay, where to start?  I loved the first Sinister up until the last 60(?) seconds.  If it would have ended with Ethan Hawk's (character's) daughter swinging down the ax and the screen going black that would have been one of the best ending of all time, but it went that extra mile and mucked it up by actually showing Bagul (Spelling?) the demon taking the girl into whatever dimension he takes the kids into... that was already implied and it felt like some executive was like, ""We still have some left in the CGI budget so lets tack this onto the ending.""  So when I heard part 2 was coming out I was cautiously optimistic.  The way 1 ended should have been enough of a warning but I liked 99% of the movie so that's pretty good, screw it, lets give the sequel a chance.  Well I'm sorry I did that because it just wasn't there.  This movie dragged on and on and even though I was pleased to see that the lead was ""Deputy so and so"" from the first movie (a likable character) it just wasn't enough to justify him and everyone that ""deserved"" to live making it out of this movie alive.  And the very end... what is with this franchise throwing in a moronic jump scare at the end of the movie.  All in all the first Sinister was a pretty cool horror flick that didn't know when to end and Sinister 2 was a boring horror flick with no imagination and none of the chutzpah the first one had.",1452470400,3,1394,4.230188679245283

Originally the kids are excited about the move but when they see strange visions in the house their attitude begins to change. Now the only way for the kids to escape the terror is to make one final movie, involving they ones they love. The first movie was creepy because it was psychological. The dad would watch a movie and then see bizarre things. This one almost dumbs down the horror and spoon feeds it to the viewers. This one also ups the blood and gore factor, which to me adds nothing to the horror aspect. There were a few parts in this that I thought were a little creepy but like most sequels this falls short of the original. Overall, nothing terrible and not the worst sequel ever made but it went away from what made the original scary and it hurt this one. I give it a C+.",1452470400,,943,4.363636363636363
7385495,5,B0147OOWMQ,My hubby and I watched this movie last night and I have to say that this was a very good movie plus it was entertaining. Now I do agree that the original was better but what made this movie interesting was MR boogeyman bc I like that this movie didn't explain who it was just the fact that it's a scary monster. Maybe in part 3 the story will conclude by showing us who or what me boogeyman really is. I think it's scary when you they don't have a back story . the performance are very good. The movie murders the children made were very creepy. I thought the messed up one was the church murder . the stupid murder movie the child made was snow murder. Like I said if you like a entertaining movie especially a R rated film and it's not pg-13 then this is a movie for you.

7385498,4,B0147OOWMQ,"And you won't be ""disappointed""!

Keep in mind that Sinister 2 is nothing like it's predecessor. It lacks the darkness, both cinematically and in storyline, it doesn't have super disturbing music (not counting the kill films), and the most of the kills are gory but not terribly disturbing (or plausible that a kid can do it themselves.), except for one. And oh the jump scares....

Sounds bad? Here's the thing, though, there is more to the storyline than the first. There are more locations than the first. It has a different, refreshing perspective. The soundtrack is pretty cool and unique. The protagonists are relatable and lovable.

 It isn't exactly scary, to me. It's unlike a lot of horror films I've seen because it has more of a plot than just ""oh spooky evil stuff call the exorcist"" and the like. As with Sinister, it follows a different formula.

I don't find it generic. There are funny and sad scenes. Yes sometimes they're handled poorly. The acting is pretty good, though there are occasional ""meh"" moments.

It has such an interesting and old-fashioned feel to it, and tons of heart, both of which aren't usually present in modern horror.

Please give it a chance, it did NOT deserve all the critic hate it got. It had a lot of potential, it still does, and it could have been handled better. But that doesn't make this a terrible movie in the slightest. It's still solid and entertaining.

My first watch I didn't like it because it was so unlike the first. My second time, I watched it for what it was and now I'm absolutely in love.",1445644800,13,1555,4.629090909090909

The film lacks a decent twist ending.  They could have left the jerky camera out too. Like most sequels it offers some more explanation and leads into another sequel. If you liked the first film, you should like this one too. 3 1/2 stars.

7385502,3,B0147OOWMQ,"The 2012 film, Sinister, broke onto the scene as a sleeper hit at the box office. The film was the perfect antidote to the hit-you-over-the-head-with-scares tactic that many other horror movies seemed to be using. Instead of the obvious horror tropes, director Scott Derrickson employed a chilling atmosphere and equally eerie soundtrack to create an unrelenting tension throughout the entire film. In the villainous architect of all the mayhem, Bughuul, moviegoers were treated to a dark and mysterious creature that I would argue is the first horror monster to truly scare since Wes Craven's Freddy Kruger.

Naturally, producer Jason Blum of Paranormal Activity and Insidious fame sought to recapture the magic of that first film with this newly released sequel. This film picks up after the events of the previous one. The main protagonist is Deputy So & So who assisted Ethan Hawkes ill-fated author in the previous film. Haunted by the revelations that were uncovered about Bughuul willing children into murdering their families, the deputy takes it upon himself to destroy all physical remnants of the monster and to prevent any future tragedies. Theres only one problema new family may already be on their way to the same horrific fate!

The mythology that was established in the first film is imperative to understanding the plot and character motivation in this one. As such, you should really see that film before giving this one a watch. In the first film, Bughuul was a terrifying presence who created fear and anxiety even when he was not on the screen. The success of that story hinged upon the audience discovering the ghastly secrets of Baghuul along with the characters. Sadly, this sequel fails to live up to the high bar that its predecessor set. With all of the answers explained in that film, this one fails to recreate the same sense of dread and discovery. The mythology trumps any chance at new revelations or surprises, making this film a plodding progression to an inevitable conclusion. The subtlety of the previous film is discarded in favor of the usual jump scares that permeate most films of the genre. As such, it feels as if this movie simultaneously has too much Baghuul and not nearly enough of him. If you watched and enjoyed the first movie, this one can be a fun continuation of that story. Still, don't be surprised if you come out of this one disappointed.",1441843200,3,2396,4.928217821782178
