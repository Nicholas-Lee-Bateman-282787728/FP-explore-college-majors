Their influence on the music I love today is so apparent that this doc is a must for any rock and roll fan.  I highly recommend!!",1141776000,,293,4.017241379310345
2510668,5,B000E97HUS,"I was blown away by this movie and recommend it to everyone.  I ran across it while at the Sundance Film Festival and almost didn't get to see it as every show was sold out. I hope they come out w/ an extended version w/ tons of extra footage because I'll buy that one as well.

Can't wait for the April DVD release.  Definietly a ""must have"" movie no matter who you are or what you are into.",1141776000,3,392,4.0
2510669,5,B000E97HUS,"I thought this movie would be a traditional ""rockumentary"" about a band - one that I knew little about - but it turned out to be more than just about the band.  It's about a man and his life - and a very interesting life at that.  Arthur Kane has seen more extreme ups and downs than anyone should ever see.  This movie takes you on the ride that is his life...and in the process, you can't help but like this guy.

Not only did I enjoy this movie, it turned me onto the roots of the very music I listen to today.  Great movie whether you are a fan of the New York Dolls are not.  I wasn't before.  I am now.",1141776000,4,608,3.894308943089431
2510670,4,B000E97HUS,"My first thought about this movie after it started was that it might be a Mormon basher and a bit hokey. WRONG!!! I learned of this film serendipitously while looking through an online movie site and just clicking on movie titles that I'd never heard of. After going to see it I will be buying a DVD for my collection.

There is always hope. For all of us!

The closing song, ""Poor Wayfaring Man Of Grief"" is the  best version I've heard. Reminds me of the way they may well have been played around a campfire. A simple guitar and a vocalist with a harmonica.

I'm glad I found this move, even more so after going to see it.",1141603200,,624,4.218487394957983
2510671,5,B000E97HUS,"New York Doll is one of the best films I've seen in the past several years.  It is compelling, compassionate and spiritual.  The story is at the same time inspirational and cautionary.  If you can consider this film to be a part of modern Mormon filmmaking, it ranks up there with the very best.  I will be glad to have this DVD on my shelf.",1138838400,9,341,4.2

2510678,5,B000E97HUS,"I never knew much about The New York Dolls. Like I knew of them, but I never explored their music or their story. Growing up I guess I was too busy listening to my music. Well watching this documentary centered around Arthur ""Killer"" Kane really moved me and part of it was seeing how much this band meant to Artists in this movie who meant a lot to me growing up. I'm not going to spoil anything but this movie just started as something that caught my eye in Prime and I hit play and the story just brought me in. Starting the movie, I didn't think I was going to even finish it but I really am glad that I did. Arthur's journey in life is amazing and it simply moved me. Everyone from Bowie to Punk to Glam Metal were influenced either directly or by another band that was influenced by The New York Dolls. The Dolls were like a Big Bang event for music genres whose influence is still propagating through today's music whether younger generations are aware of it or not.",1497139200,3,973,4.264864864864865
2510679,5,B000E97HUS,"Having had met Arthur in the 70s as a teen at his request, I found this movie so incredibly sad.  He was a sweetheart.  I was too young to realize he was an alcoholic.  Not judging.  I just didn't know.  He had enough class to walk us to a hotel in his platform shoes since we all wouldn't fit in a limo. He did tell me liquor stores were open much later in NYC than PA.  We watched The Dolls watch themselves on tv.  No sex.  No drugs.  Just rock and roll.  I hope he is at peace.",1495584000,,481,3.816326530612245

2510681,5,B000E97HUS,"In the very early seventies, I and a friend went to see the New York Dolls at a place in Tampa FL.
called Dino's. It was late at night and the band was on stage. Come to find out they were staying
at a motel next to the club. I had lived right down the road a bit and my friend Monia and I invited
the band over. This was not a groupie thing, by any means. It was just a friendly gesture, they
were from out of town. I had an old Wurlitzer record player, a kind you would see at a bowling
alley. Of course, you had to put change in it to pic your songs. We all just sat around, partied and
listened to the Wurlitzer!!! To this day, David J. would call me Wurlitzer Kim! This, by the way was
the original Dolls, big hair, tall shoes, the whole thing!! . And this tribute to Arthur, ""Killer Kane""
is awesome!!!!!!!! Thanks Amazon!!",1492387200,,829,4.0

2510707,5,B000E97HUS,"This documentary was so beautifully done, I had to give it the highest rating. So many times I have been sucked into the ""Where Are They Now?"" or ""Behind The Music"" episodes knowing where the formulated programming will take me, just enough to pique my curiosity, usually not telling anything I didn't already know. But, this was different. It was so intriguing from the first few seconds of the opening credits and use of an animated timeline of the New York Dolls growth and demise, focusing on bassist  Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, and his rise and fall within this band, and his own personal struggles with the life he had with the Dolls and the current life he has with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It was obvious to me he struggled in both worlds, and it seemed his current life protected him from the downfall of the other, but he hadn't quite reconciled with either. Well worth viewing.",1392681600,,907,4.598765432098766

2510709,5,B000E97HUS,"New York Doll was one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen. Any NYD fan would love to see Arthur ""Killer"" Kane in his splendor.

The documentary opens up on Kane's life as of 2004, just prior to the NYD show at the Meltdown Festival in London. Kane, now a Mormon working at a local library, having given up on music, is barely making ends meet. One day he's confronted by Morrissey, who asks him to come to London to perform with David and Sylvain, the only other survivors of the band New York Dolls. He somewhat hesitantly agrees. He's obviously haunted by his musical past.

The second half of this documentary focuses on Kane meeting up with the Dolls who now have a replacement drummer and lead guitarist (Johnny and Jerry were both sadly deceased by this point). As they practice for the upcoming reunion gig, Kane gets nervous but he still has that spark that makes him a legendary bass guitarist.

Then comes the show itself. Fans cheer as the band comes out and plays Jet Boy while scenes of the band in 1973 flash on the screen. This part almost had me in tears. After the show, fans approach Kane and give him their thanks and compliments.

Then as Kane debates whether or not to renew his musical career, the worst possible thing happens. Kane develops leukemia, and dies shortly after.

While the Dolls went on after Kane's death, he'll never be forgotten. He was a vital part of the Dolls that can't be replaced. This documentary sums up the last year of his life and how after years out of the music scene, one reunion gig restarted what could have been a legendary new chapter in Dolls history.",1391644800,6,1616,4.52054794520548

2510711,5,B000E97HUS,I love this movie. Even if you have no idea who the New York Dolls are this is a great story about one guy and a second chance at his dream.,1383782400,,140,3.5483870967741935
2510712,5,B000E97HUS,"This is the story of former bass player for the New York Dolls, Arthur ""Killer"" Kane. After leaving the Dolls, Kane eventually became a Mormon, and even worked at their Los Angeles temple. Morrissey (former Smiths vocalist and president of the New York Dolls' fan club when he was a teenager) brings the band back together to do a reunion show. This is a very touching story of a very gentle man, who died far too young.",1383696000,2,420,4.467532467532467

2510715,5,B000E97HUS,"This is an excellent documentary!  A reminder that dreams do come true and faith is rewarded.  For Dolls fans, of course it is a must-see.  However, it is so well-made and touching that even non-Dolls fans should really enjoy it.  A short 70-ish minutes, this movie follows Arthur Kane as he prepares for a reunion of the New York Dolls - a dream he's had as he toiled in obscurity and poverty since their breakup some 30 years earlier.

Arthur is just amazing!  He seems fragile - and yet hardened by his past and/or strengthened by his faith in such a way as to seem impervious to any hardship of life.  And Morrissey, so often appearing to be a pompous jerk, comes off as almost humble!  Not only was he singularly responsible for bringing the Dolls back together and making Arthur's wish come true, he introduces the Dolls saying ""without the Dolls I wouldn't be here"".  I always liked the Smiths and knew Morrissey was a huge Dolls fan, but I have a new appreciation of him after watching this documentary.

This is an amazingly bittersweet story but when it was over I was left with such a feeling of admiration for Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.  His dignity was truly inpiring.  RIP Arthur.",1369353600,3,1189,4.556603773584905
2510716,5,B000E97HUS,"I'm not particularly religious, but you really have to wonder about divine intervention when it comes to ""New York Doll.""  A film student happens upon a middle-aged, balding, somewhat melancholy man working at a Mormon temple claiming to be Arthur Kane of The New York Dolls, one of the most influential bands in rock history.  Turns out he really is and we're taken on a bizarre journey seeing how he disappeared out of the rock scene and totally bottomed out (and I mean totally) before happening upon an ad for the Mormon church.  There, he finds religion and, through the influence of Morrissey (apparently the world's #1 New York Dolls fan) is reunited with the remaining band mates for a reunion concert, which is what Arthur has wanted for years.  Old wounds are healed and the concert re-ignites interest in The Dolls.  Then Arthur returns to LA for a shocking denouement.  Touching and unforgettable.",1366243200,4,909,4.87012987012987

2510718,5,B000E97HUS,"Great story.  I'm a bit partial since I've loved the New York Dolls since their being part of the New York scene in the 1970's.

That said, much of the music that has become the sound track of my life wouldn't have been written without these guys starting this band.  I also find it sad, that the groups that jump start movements don't always get the credit or the fame they deserve.

Maybe the things that made them great are the exact same things that made them implode.  Regardless of my personal feelings on this, this is a great and tragic story of Arthur and what happened to him after the band broke up and the triumph of his being able to experience it again.",1359936000,,667,4.304
2510719,5,B000E97HUS,"There is a lot of honesty in this movie about a critically acclaimed rock group and its lead singer and their tumultuous career.

2510723,5,B000E97HUS,"This is a fun documentary for anyone interested in the New York Dolls, or punk. After the band's breakup, Arthur ""Killer"" Kane was ""lost"", for no better word. After a long downward spiral of drugs and alcohol, he found that everyone had left him, or he'd driven everyone away. He jumped from his apartment window in an unsuccessful attempt to end the pain. While recovering from his injuries, he comes across an ad offering a free Book of Mormon and finds a place for himself where he finds that he is an unlikely fit. His one dream is to play with the Dolls again and that's the story left to be told.

Tons of guests from rock/punk (Iggy, Morrissey, etc.) underground to comment. Uplifting and a little bit of a tear-jerker. I wouldn't call this a Mormon movie, since that is just one aspect of the film. A friends grandmother bought this, thinking it was a religious movie and her disappointment led to his inheritance of the DVD. I got to borrow it and ended up needing my own copy.",1307750400,4,986,4.477777777777778

I remember listening to the Todd Rundgren produced protopunk NY Dolls and could recognize lead singer David Johansen on sight but then, hey, I moved on! Apparently Kane, who has a sweet Nigel Tufnel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-Spinal-Tap-Criterion-Collection/dp/1559408758/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is Spinal Tap - Criterion Collection</a>) quality about him never did after the band crashed and burned in a classic rock star sort-of-way in the early 80s.  Kane took their break up very, very hard and then his life went down a long, sad road.

It was being recruited door-to-door by the Church of Latter Day Saint's missionaries that rescued him and finally gave him a family of sorts and a job.  However, Kane's dream in life is for a reunion of the Dolls even if his guitar is in hock!  Although it in no way proselytizes, this movie reflects very positively on the LDS members who love him and believe in him as finally does another much more prominent musician of that era.

The great sound track makes you want to get out that eye make-up, glitter and hairspray and go glam once more.  And stash a Kleenex or two for the touching conclusion because, to quote my favorite protopunk band The Police, you will be ""driven to tears.""",1277596800,,1622,5.733333333333333
2510725,2,B000E97HUS,"The director states that he had well over 100 hours of footage to work with.  For such an exhausting recording project, this is a paltry product.

What we end up with in this documentary is a very sad and pathetic Arthur Kane, broke, alone and working at the Mormon library (having been SAVED by them, he is so lost and zombie-like at the end, that he really has no other place to go).  He is shown retrieving his guitar from a pawn shop (where they bilked him into keeping it on loan) so that he could play the Dolls' final gig together in 2004.

We see Barbara Kane only once, maybe twice, hardly anything from Sylvain and David Jo, little from other musicians around at the time, and only snippets of commentary by people like Iggy Pop.  Morrissey is given the most time, with a 15 minute extra interview.

I'm sure there is much more to Arthur Kane's life than is presented here.  To include so little from the wife was just ignorant.",1262390400,,938,4.38728323699422

2510727,4,B000E97HUS,"The New York Dolls were one of the greatest bands in punk history; but, like a lot of influential bands and greatness, we didn't quite get it until it was all over.  Enjoyment of these things comes from not just living their dreams but knowing about the people behind the scenes.  How much did we really know about these people?  As it turns out, not much.  So was the case for the bass player, Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.

Fame came first for the Dolls, but not fortune.  Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan would die in the mid 1990s, but Arthur floundered while David Johansen went on to further fame and fortune as Buster Poindexter and an acting career.  Who would have thought that he would have found Jesus - in the Church of Ladder Day Saints no less, and become a Mormon working in one of the church's libraries.  The Mormon faith helped him overcome his troubles (bad home life, alcohol, etc.) but he still clung to the past, hoping against hope that somehow he could reunite with the Dolls.  Morissey plays a strange role in this, helping him reunite with the surviving Dolls and in fact, getting them back together.

This is a story about hope, about overcoming hardships, finding your passions, and resolution of the past.  Arthur had his claim to fame, but he also had a new one in his work in the Mormon church.  Eccentric characters make the world go round.",1236470400,,1363,4.540983606557377
2510728,3,B000E97HUS,"I felt I had to write a review to counter all the 5 star reviews.  This movie is fine but slow paced.  If your considering it because you are a New York Dolls fan, there are some early clips but most have voice overs.  The sound from the reunion concert is not that good.  There are other NYD DVD's out there.

If you are considering this as a human interest story, Kine comes across as someone sleepwalking through life, stuck in the past, wishing the glory days would return and resenting David J. for his success.

2510730,5,B000E97HUS,"Sometimes you come across a movie by accident which you know very little about and are blown away by it.

That is New York Doll.

No one could have written a movie like this and filmed it as fiction.  It wouldn't have worked.  It would have been too quirky, too bizarre to be believed. A fictional Arthur would be impossible. But because it is real and true and because Arthur talks about his life in the two completely different worlds he has inhabited in his guileless and humble way, you are immediately drawn in.

Punk, fast living, sex, drugs, and rock and roll meets calm devout abstemious Mormonism.  Sounds like a movie to pass on doesn't it.  But if you do it will be your loss.  The movie isn't preachy, it doesn't push either lifestyle it just is what it is.  If you don't have an emotional response to this movie regardless of where you fit in lifes spectrum you need to go see a specialist.

This movie is a complete gem. Is the sound always perfect? No. Could it have been shot and cut differently? I guess. Im not really into that stuff so I don't know what I would have done differently.  Does this movie work?  Absolutely.

I predict it will have a life far into the future as more and more people buy the DVD and show it to their friends.  It's addictive.  Every so often I have to watch it again.",1231718400,3,1315,4.310204081632653
2510731,5,B000E97HUS,"How do you go wrong with a documentary about the New York Dolls, Morrissey, and Mormonism?  Yes, the film NEW YORK DOLL offers this all, but more importantly, it offers the truly bittersweet story of one man who's ultimate wish is fulfilled just when he needs it most.

You'll learn the story of Arthur Kane, who tasted rock glory as the bassist for the New York Dolls, only to lose it all as the group imploded in a storm of addiction, egos, and too much too soon.  Arthur was left with a terrible drinking problem, and the memory of once being on top of the world, one that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

Luckily, Arthur has two guardian angels, Morrissey and Mormonism.  After losing everything he had and turning into a complete drunk, Arthur manages to get sober and find stable, although slightly less glamorous employment, based on his dedication to the Church of Mormon.  With the help of his faith, he lives a quiet peaceful life but constantly dreams of reuiniting with his old bandmates to reclaim their glory that was cut short way too soon.

Now enter Arthur's second guardian angel, one many might argue is much holier than the Church of Mormon and happens to be the NY Dolls biggest fan- Morrissey.  When he's given the chance to organize a music festival, Morrissey invites the Dolls to play, which means Arthur's wish will be answered- his band will reunite and he'll experience rock stardom once again.

I don't want to give too much away, but NEW YORK DOLL is a film full of impossible turns, some glorious and some tragic.  Besides the astonishing plot, another great element of this film is the dynamics of the personalities involved.  Arthur's lifestyle when he reuinites with his bandmates in 2004 is a lot different from the one he led in the 1970s, but with the help of his sweet demeanor he's accepted for the church loving library that he's become. Another bonus to the film are terrific interviews with Morrissey describing the impact music can have on someone's life and explaining why it meant so much to him to bring the Dolls back together.

This film is a must for Moz fans, Dolls fans, or anyone at all!  Don't miss NEW YORK DOLL.",1220745600,,2176,4.59173126614987
2510732,4,B000E97HUS,"In his eulogy as song ""NY Doll"", Robyn Hitchock sang, ""People touch you.  How do I explain?""  This sentiment could also apply to this truly wonderful look at the life, more the latter life, of Arthur ""The Killer"" Kane.  And what an intriguing picture it paints of this former New York Doll and glam/punk-rock icon.  The Arthur Kane most of us knew was the bedazzled, lurching creature that anchored the New York Dolls in the 1970s, a quiet foil to David Johansen's flamboyant stage persona (think of the dynamic between John Entwhistle and Roger Daltry, or lack thereof,  and you get the idea).  In fact, Kane was once referred to as ""the only living statue in rock-and-roll.""

But this film brings Kane into sharp focus in the early 2000s.  Not the drug casualty that rumor had him to be, and certainly not anything like his former self in the Dolls, aside from the lumbering, stoic demeanor being still evident.  No, the Killer was alive & well, a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for years, and was now working as a volunteer librarian in the genealogy center at the Los Angeles Temple for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  It is truly an odd vision to see this man, known for his outlandish glam attire and frothy hairdo, appearing as a way more than normal man in a white dress shirt and tie.  And that's where the film starts to get really interesting.

To say more would do an injustice to the beauty of this tale of Kane's last years.  Needless to say, though, it is a true story that is both sad and heart-warming in the most human and least expected of ways.

I have caught it twice on Showtime...I know the New York Dolls, I was too young to have discovered them in the '70's. Well, ok, truth be told I was an 8-year old busy trying to be Major Tom of ""Space Oddity""...so I overlooked the Dolls.

But in the 1980's discovered them and loved them. I got a chance to see David Johanson live pre-Buster Poindexter and also saw Johnny Thunders. So those were the only two Dolls I knew of.

I have re-discovered them AGAIN, having seen them just this past February (2008) in Chicago. Wow. They are just as good as ever...Syl Sylvain, and the new guitarist Steve Conte...of course Syl is a legend also and the new guitarist is fantastic. Even looks a bit like Johnny did back in the day.

I knew *of* Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, but that was  all until I saw this documentary. I am enthralled.

There is a great deal of old Dolls footage, and I love the interviews of Chrissie Hynde, Sir Bob Geldof, and Morrissey. These are the artists I  really grew up idolizing in the '80's.

I dont'want to give away too much about the film. Everyone else has covered the details. The guitars in the pawn shop, Arthur's conversion to  Mormon, the reunion concert in London...everything.

Everyone knows Arthur has passed away. But the way it happened....incredible. Just amazing.

Everything in this man's life was *so* meant to  be. There are no ifs, ands or buts.  That makes it so touching. He was such a sweet and gentle man. And a *Killer* bass player. I wish I would have had the chance to have seen him in person, as well.

2510734,5,B000E97HUS,"Many great reasons abound to watch the film ""New York Doll,"" about the weirdo world of Arthur Kane. It's an accurate documentary on a difficult subject with which to be objective: the post-rock-stardom life of a well known musician who bottomed out without financial success. Kane had been by far the weirdest individual of one of America's weirdest bands after all.

It provides the only cool footage of Kane's band, the legendary USA glamsters of the early 1970's The New York Dolls, besides Bob Gruen's excellent, exhaustively documented ""All Dolled Up.""

It's a true bridge between organized religion and rock & roll craziness, the Apollonian/Dionysian ideal, insofar as the filmmaker, a fellow Mormon like the film's subject, had to travel the same psychic distance to understand Kane as Kane had to in order to understand his newly embraced religion.

It shows the New York Dolls reunion in London's 2004 Meltdown, fun in itself, with footage of an astonishing insight of understanding backstage. Flamboyantly extroverted lead singer David Johansen immediately intuits that he's gone too far teasing Kane about the latter's newly embraced religion, instantaneously does an about face, backs off and joins in Kane's pre-gig band prayer. I like this.

I was also touched by the Mormon church's involvement in Kane's later life. I don't want to reveal much, but for them to get Kane's guitars out of hock so he could play was very moving. I have greater respect for the church for the way they dealt with Kane. They were incredible themselves.

In interviews with Chrissie Hynde, Sir Bob Geldof, Iggy Pop, and many others influenced by the Dolls' sound, as well as church officials who've grown close to Kane, a portrait emerges of greatness derailed by substance abuse and personal conflict.

2510740,5,B000E97HUS,"There is a reason that this movie is getting high praise.  It's not the camera work, which is amateurish at best.  It's not the careful planning, because if there ever was a case of a filmmaker stumbling on a perfect story, this is it.  What makes this film so good is absolute honesty framing a near perfect story.

When I first started this dvd I was leery.  It started with this guy, Arthur Kane, a stuttering former musician with a mostly failed life.  He had achieved a level of acceptance as a convert to the Mormon Church which led to a simple life.  As an employee of the Church at the Family History Center, he was leading a quiet life, a friendly life with people around him who accepted him for being Arthur and had no idea that he'd been the bass guitarist for the New York Dolls, the original glam-rock band.  In his music days he was a hard-drinking wild dressing rock star with a penchant for excitement and a taste for the illicit.

As I said, I was leery.  As a former Mormon, I was immediately suspect as the filmmaker included interviews with church authorities and Arthur's home teachers (as it turns out, the filmmaker himself was one of Arthur's home teachers, which explains his ""right place at the right time"" success in making a powerful documentary).  Arthur stuttered through his explanations of his previous life and his conversion.  He seemed unsure about everything in his life, an unlikely hero in any story much less his own.

But that changed with the revelation that Arthur was to go to a reunion concert in London being organized by Morrisey (formerly of the Smiths, now solo).  Then we see Arthur revealing his history and discussing his anxiousness at being reunited with former bandmate and estranged friend David Johansen.  Interviews proceed throughout by friends from the seventies, musicians who admired the Dolls and Arthur, and even his ex-wife whom he had beaten with cat furniture in a drunken rage before attempting suicide.

I admit that I got wrapped up in the movie and forgot all my trepidations, left behind with my own anxiety for Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.  He hadn't played guitar in years and even had to borrow money to get his instruments out of perpetual hock at a local pawn shop.  Would he be able to get into form, would he still ""have it,"" would the tensions of reuniting be the major story, and would they actually get onto stage in London?  All these questions became foremost in my mind, with Arthur's faith and the film making itself forgotten, just part of the scenery as it should be.

I can't really tell you any more, because it'll give away too much of a powerful story.  I will say that he led his band-mates in prayer and I actually wanted to say Amen.  And, I will say that I had tears in my eyes at the end.  I will also say that if it'd been fiction, I'd have been screaming at the screen that it never happens that way in real life.

I'll also say, watch this movie.

Kane had become a bitter drug casualty, resentful of his brief time in the spotlight. His frustration and confusion eventually culminated in a window-dive that he thankfully survived. Then it appears that Kane was reborn, starting a new, humble, self-reflective life in the Mormon church, the relative importance of so-called stardom now in perspective. When the fan-singer Morrissey brings the surviving Dolls together for a ""one-off,"" we are privileged to witness Kane's life full-circle.

When the New York Dolls finally play in their reunion show, the film ""ping pongs"" between an old performance and new performance making you see how the members, especialy Kane, have changed.

The film allows the viewer to learn so much about Kane and develop a caring about him as a person ( as opposed to rock and roll star) that the revelation of his untimely death creates a lot of emotion in the viewer. I cried my eyes out.

2510745,5,B000E97HUS,"As the opening scenes of ""New York Doll"" unfold, we hear the Johnny Thunders-penned classic ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory,"" in which the lyric cautions: ""You can't put your arms around a memory, so don't try.""  Well, I for one am sure glad the filmmakers didn't give in to that particular notion, because this brisk and uplifting film lovingly puts its arms around the remnants of a once-great band and firmly pulls them into the present, where they are rendered just as glorious as ever (if not moreso).

The film picks up the story of the washed up ex-legend Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, nearly 30 years removed from his rock n roll glory days.  He's seen and survived all kinds of abuse (self-inflicted and otherwise) but now has achieved a modicum of peace as a Mormon Church librarian.  But when he receives word that his old band will be reforming for a huge show at London's Royal Albert Hall at rock star Morrissey's bequest, we are able to follow him as he embarks upon a once-in-a-lifetime journey of closure and compassion, living a dream long unfulfilled.

This movie works both as a ""rockumentary"" for New York Dolls fans (with great archival footage, as grainy as the beer-soaked memories themselves) and as a beautiful (and often funny) human drama of reconciliation and redemption.

For extras, the DVD features a 6-minute interview with the film's likeable director Greg Whiteley (also a Mormon, who met Kane at church), in which he reveals, ""What we didn't want to do was make a VH1 Behind the Music...a rockumentary...because we just felt like something else happened here.""  Mission accomplished, I would say.

Also bonus-featured is an interesting, expanded 18-minute interview with Morrissey, who's always good for a quote or three.  He talks about being neighbors with Arthur long before the film was even conceived and having heart to hearts with the man about his sad and embittered life experiences and the ""unlucky, blighted and cursed"" legacy of the New York Dolls.  In addition, he recounts how he was able to convince and cajole both David Johansen (a long-reluctant holdout) and Arthur himself to reunite the New York Dolls for Morrissey's Meltdown festival.

Finally, we get a nice, little two-minute hymn where Johansen (accompanied by Brian Koonin on acoustic guitar) sings ""Come, Come Ye Saints"" and sounds like a latter day Tom Waits.

At one point in his life, it was widely rumored that Arthur had died from alcoholism. Obviously not true. Throughout this film, he comes across as a gentle, kind, wryly funny man who'd achieved some peace and tranquility in his life. Save for one unfinished piece of business - making amends with David Johansen and playing on stage with the N.Y. Dolls one more time. That Morrissey managed to reunite the band, and give Arthur the chance to live his unfulfilled dream, is very moving. Arthur sitting in a hotel room in England, marveling at the furniture and the comfort of the room, shows a man who had come to inhabit a state of gratitude. That he returned from that triumphant gig and passed on two weeks later is not nearly as sad as you might think. You can truly say he died a happy man, at peace with himself and the world.

After many years of wandering in relative obscurity Kane found inner peace through his membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Kane found as much personal satisfaction schlepping on a L.A. bus to his job at the Mormon library than he did pounding the stage with a high profile glam-rock band.  Kane never lost the desire to reunite with his former bandmates and entertain the masses.  Throughout the history of rock there have many examples of performers attempting to reconcile the profound with the seemingly profane, Elvis and Bob Dylan coming to mind.  I can't recall it captured more poignantly or succinctly as in ""New York Doll"".  The events captured in the film would seemingly be the result of divine intervention.  Is it mere coincidence that Morrissey happened to be in L.A., where Kane lived in relative obscurity, at the same time both were trying to facilitate a Dolls reunion?  I was also touched by the reserved Kane making peace with the extroverted lead singer David Johansen whom he had previously had an uneasy relationship.  The tribute to Kane by Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain over the closing credits was also moving.

2510755,5,B000E97HUS,"Glam,punk rockers The New York Dolls became more popular and influential after their two studio albums and break-up in 1975--then when they were in their prime.

They inspired a varied group of musicians -- some of whom (Chrissy Hynde, Iggy Pop, Morrissey, Bob Geldorf appear on camera here).

The most famous band member is musician/actor David Johansen who became better known as Buster Poindexter for many years.

This documentary is about another original member, Charles 'Killer' Kane- the base player who faded into neary poverty, drug and alcohol addiction and obscurity shortly after the band broke up.

Greg Whiteley, a devout Mormon and aspiring film-maker began making ""New York Doll"" a couple of years after he met one of his Mormon brothers, Arthur Kane who quickly explained he was once known as `Killer' Kane the bassist for the legendary punk rock band, New York Dolls. In a truth-is-stranger-than-fiction development, Kane got wind of a rumor that what he had prayed for nearly 30 years to happen----The New York Dolls were going to re-unite.

Wait a minute 'Killer Kane' wound up an LDS member?  Yep.

When several of Kane's congregational members raised $300 dollars and gave it to him to get his old bass guitars out of hock at the pawn-shop, Greg Whiteley decided to grab a camera and start filming what was going on. At the very least Arthur Kane was a unique interesting individual that would make a good subject for a documentary even if the re-union of the Dolls did not happen.

Whitely was absolutely right, his documentary New York Doll, an intimate portrait of Arthur Kane and a brief history of the New York Dolls, does indeed make a fascinating, surprisingly touching and moving documentary.

""Killer' Kane, the statuesque tall bassist for the outrageous New York Dolls a quiet, humble born-again religious librarian?

It's hard to believe that the soft spoken, white shirt and tie wearing, Arthur Kane who we meet riding a series of busses to get to work was once a punk glam boy. It's hard to believe that Morrissey invited the Dolls to re-unite for his 2004 Meltdown Festival in London. We learn that Morrissey was an avid fan and almost an all out groupie of the New York Dolls when he was 13 years old.

It's also hard to believe that the three surviving members of the Dolls mostly in their early 50s would get back together again and be able to create music truly worth listening to without completely embarrassing themselves.

We get a concise history of the Dolls and learn about their influence from Chrissie Hynde, Bob Geldoff, Mick Jones (of the Clash) and Morrissey. The Dolls (and Bowie's Ziggy Stardust band) broke through the formulaic heavy metal (with their ten minute drum solos) and dull progressive rock bands (with their ten minute synthesizer solos). They created some excellent songs (sounding like something Green Day would release today) while wearing platform heels, tight leather pants, huge hair, mascara, lipstick and swatches of material that transformed them into disheveled transvestite hookers.

So did Arthur Kane's dream of a reuniting with David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain actually happen? Was it a huge success, a pleasant bit of nostalgia or an utter embarrassment? Did Arthur say prayers before going on stage? Did he patch up the feud and bitter feelings he had about David?

This is the bitter-sweet story about what happened. Since it is about one of the most outrageous punk rock bands from the 70s, trying to explain this is a `bittersweet' story is an ironic challenge.

This is not a VH1 Behind the Music kind of profile. It is much more than that. It is a tender but honest portrait of an extremely fragile human being--Arthur Kane. Sure I wish we would have heard and seen a bit more music than we do in the movie, but you can buy the albums for that.

The film will touch you. The story is sad, but strangely uplifting.

The film is very short (only 78 minutes) and the DVD has a few extras--like an 8 minute interview with the producer/director and a long interview (part of which is used in the film) with Morrisey. Unfortunately we don't get to see any full length performances of the Dolls--but don't let that stop you for a moment from watching this stranger than fiction documentary.

It is rated PG-13 because of some strong language.",1148860800,32,4324,4.836043360433604
2510756,5,B000E97HUS,"It is more common to get a movie with good technical execution but with no story.  In New York Doll, we get a great and wonderful story about nastalgia intermixed with personal change.

Arthur, interestingly clings to his early years when he was a member of the New York Dolls.  Even though he is over 50 years old he still longs to get back to those days when he was playing music in the band.

Having watched the movie, I realize that we all long for something nastalgic.  We want to live in simpler or happier times.  We tend to remember the ""best of"" our early lives.

At one point in the film, Authur mentions that he is just there to make other people happy.  It never really was about him.  He is portrayed in this film as a happy gentle man who get what he was wishing for.

The editing is at times choppy and perhaps a little disconnected, but the story holds it all together.  To be fair, it's really hard to judge the editing because we don't really know what footage was available to the director.  For example, he mentioned that one of the first calls he got was that Arthur (the subject of the story,) was going to the pawn shop to get his guitar.  The director (and apparently cameraman) said, ""Do you mind if I come along and shoot this.""  Given that context, it's hard to find fault because you wouldn't have a separate angle to edit in, no formal audio equipment.  Given those constraints, the editing is probably really good.",1148688000,,1444,4.37593984962406

This film was such a moving bio, it took me until the lights came on, the screen went blank and the ushers started cleaning to get up outta my seat and leave. It's a fun, sad, endearing, tragic and truly beautiful human story of  Arthur ""Killer"" Kane, bass player for the ground breaking New York Dolls.",1147910400,6,440,4.365853658536586
2510758,3,B000E97HUS,"This film is definitely worth watching for its remarkable story that ties together two American phenomena that are seemingly unreconcilable: Mormonism and New York glam/rock/punk.  Arthur ""Killer"" Kane of the New York Dolls joined the Mormon Church sometime after the band broke up (upon the death of two of its members).  He gets the chance to go back, and performs in a remarkable reunion concert organized by Morrissey (of the Smiths, a big fan of the Dolls).  Somebody had the foresight to capture this comeback on film, and to document this intriguing life from the perspective both of the fans and friends of the band and from the perspective of the Mormon community he had joined.

What makes the film less stellar than it might be is the amateurish cinematography (nobody told the cameraman that overuse of the ""zoom"" function tends to be annoying, and mostly dropped out even from the ""rockumentary"" genre in the 70's), and the ponderous editing.  The recording of the few hours before the concert, which should have been filled with tension, excitement and reflection, was a bit ponderous and boring due to the filmmakers' awkward efforts at building an artificial tension -- every 10 minutes it would say ""40 minutes before the concert ... 30 minutes before on stage ..."" and he would ask Arthur something like ""are you nervous"" and Arthur would say something like ""Not really .."" -- the tension and excitement in Arthur that was apparent came out in spite of all this.  The unnecessarily prolonged (not because awkward moments should be avoided at all costs but because the filmmakers don't appear to have given careful enough thought to what they wanted to achieve and how best to tell the story they wanted) moments like these tended to undercut the power of a few really interesting scenes like the prayer that Arthur said right before the concert and the reactions of the various crew and band members.  While their access to subjects for interviews was remarkable, the filmmakers tended to ask questions that didn't strike me as the most relevant -- and that also betrayed their inexperience with the punk rock/glam rock scene to which the New York Dolls belonged, and suggested they were much more clearly at home in and understanding of the Mormon community.  An exceptional scene of the band playing and singing a classic Mormon hymn was saved for halfway through the credits, when it could have instead leant extraordinary impact to the closing moments of the film.  These and similar moments betray the inexperience of the filmmakers in ways that detracted from the story for me.

Having said that, I am grateful to the filmmakers for having captured on film a very intriguing story that is well worth telling and that I enjoyed watching.  I would rather see an amateurish documentary like this with an intriguing subject than the loads of professionally polished but uninspiring cinema that gets dumped on the cineplexes every week.",1147305600,17,2955,4.9375

I was disapointed at first that there wasn't much on the other NY Dolls, but then I just came to love Arthur Kane and then didn't care that I wasn't seeing footage of Thunders/Nolan/Murcia/Sylvain/Johansen.

2510760,5,B000E97HUS,Wonderful doccumentary. It deals with Aurthur 'Killer' Kane who was the bassest of the New York Dolls. It starts off interviewing him in 2004 and keeps going up until the reformation of the Dolls. He talks about some of the problems he had after the Dolls split up and his diffuculty dealing with former bandmates succeeding when he was not getting anywhere with his music carreer. It also shows his life now. He joined the Mormon Church and finally found what he was meant to do with the rest of his life. He works at thier temple in LA helping out where he can. Some of the best interviews are with church members that he works with. You can tell they really care for him and wish him the best. When he finds out about the reunion he is ecstatic but is nervous about the atmosphere conflicting with his moral beliefs and how his former bandmates accept him. They show the performance and alot of the acts that he influenced are interviewed about the importance of the dolls. The only negative thing I can say about this is that alot of the footage is available on the New York Doll reunion dvd. This is a trully special dvd for a very special person.,1145750400,3,1152,4.413145539906103

2510763,5,B000E97HUS,"Having missed ""New York Doll"" at the Sundance Film Festival (it was sold-out) and the local theaters (couldn't get the wife to go to a documentary about another ""rock 'n' roll casualty""), I was destined to await the release of the DVD.  I'm sorry now that I didn't see it sooner.

The story of Arthur ""Killer"" Kane is typical and atypical.  Typical in the sense of the prototypical 1970s rocker, who found fame and near-fortune, only to throw it all away in the name of excess and a larger-than-life ego, leaving him destitute, lonely and in ill-health...even suicidal.

But in a way, Kane's story is atypical. Instead of Kane turning into the next Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin or Pete Ham, he stumbles upon the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) religion - Arthur would say it was divinely guided - that gives him internal peace and a change of heart.  You seem to witness a man now at peace.  At peace with his rock 'n' roll past and bitter relationships with his past bandmates.  At peace with the denial of fame and fortune.  At peace with his current simple lifestyle working at the local LDS Family History Center. At peace with normal people (whose presence he would have distained years earlier).  In a way, it seems it took him a lifetime of hell to find heaven.  How fitting that he died so poor in a temporal sense, yet so rich in spirit.

The three most poignant moments for me was went former Dolls lead singer, David Johansen makes his 'rock god' entrance into the New York rehearsal studio and to watch Arthur's uncertain face to see how his old friend and rival would react to his presence.  When they embrace, you can see the years of distrust and bitterness disappear.  The second moment was the discussion between Arthur and David moments before their reunion concert about Mormonism's Word of Wisdom (health code forbidding smoking, drinking and drugs) and adherence to the Ten Commandments.  It is humorous, but also enlightening that even David admits (through his own trials) that he has made similar decisions to quit such behavior (all except his addiction to smoking and ""one commandment."")  The final touching moment was Arthur leading the reunited New York Dolls in a prayer before their concert.  I don't think I've ever heard a Christian prayer asking for the Lord's blessing upon a rock concert before, but I honestly believe that God was on the stage that night with Arthur and the rest of the New York Dolls.

What a great movie for all ages, backgrounds and faiths. When Christ spoke of, ""blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven"" he was referring to Arthur.  May God bless Arthur ""Killer"" Kane.",1144800000,40,2686,4.715203426124197

The few extras are top notch, particularly the stand alone version of the hymn David Johansen sings during the credits.  After experiencing the final five minutes of the movie, hearing his rendition of that piece will tingle your spine.

Wow.

Great movie!  I love the Dolls, but Arthur Kane's journey is the real story here.  The balance is perfect- just enough background  for those who don't know the band, enough for those who don't know the religion, the interpersonal issues, other musicians, etc.  The director has painted an objective yet heartfelt picture without overwhelming the viewer in detail.
As Greg Whiteley says in the bonus interview, ""this is not a VH-1 Behind The Music"".  It's a beautiful film about one man's journey through a not-so-easy life.

2510767,5,B000E97HUS,"The New Yorks Dolls are one of the most influentual bands in the history of modern music. They gave birth to the Glam and Punk movements of the 1970's and were the primary fashion influence of the hair bands of the 1980's.  Most of my own favorite bands probably would have never existed if the Dolls had not existed first. And honestly, I don't think they ever wrote a bad song.

Anyway, as someone who was born Mormon, but grew up ""punk"" and now exists somewhere between the two this movie spoke to me on more levels than one. I was afraid it might seem like Mormon propaganda (it does not) or might make fun of Mormonism (it also does not.) It is very honest and I was moved to tears several times.

The extra features on the DVD are must sees and hearing David Johansen sing one of my all-time favorite hymns (Come, Come Ye Saints) was just amazing.

I certainly didn't realize the impact that they had on popular music.  So from that point of view it was interesting to see that glam rock and punk both can trace their lineage directly to 'The Dolls'.  It is really amazing how many bands these guys influenced in their short meteoric career.

But that's not the point of this movie.  What could have been a compelling 'Behind The Music' episode turned into so much more as the director shot this movie.  The filmmakers got lucky - this story about an aging rock star transcends into a tale of humanity right before your eyes.

I don't want to talk about what happens because that would ruin the experience.  When the movie started and I met Arthur ""Killer"" Kane on a Los Angeles city bus, I was oddly intrigued.  Kane has a strange, gentle way about him, and a soft spokenness that makes you watch.  During that bus ride, Arthur had no idea where his life was about to go, and neither did I.

When the lights came up, there was hardly a dry eye in the house.  But we weren't sad.  We were smiling through our tears.  Everyone around me had been profoundly affected by what we had seen on the screen.  That sounds hokey, but I'm serious.  No one got up for a while.  It was as if we had to allow the impact of this powerful story sink in before we went on with our lives.

It's not about rock and roll, or religion, or groupies, or the price of fame - although it's about all of these things.  It's a story of redemption.  It's a story about holding onto a dream while everything else falls apart.

The movie revolves around a punk rock bassist from the 70s, Arthur ""Killer"" Kane to be exact and his band, the ""The New York Dolls."" If you haven't heard of the Dolls before, then this is a great way to find out just how they helped shape American pop/rock culture.

Even though ""Killer"" had a good run in the spotlight it would never last as long as he hoped it would. The dreams faded and his mind went on vacation, he was slowly falling down that spiral of stairs he worked so hard to climb. In 1989 he had hit rock bottom by attempting to commit suicide through jumping out a window. He survives and while recovering is introduced to the Mormon religion through advertisement and when he fully recovers, seeks refuge in a LDS church.

I don't want to go over the whole movie but know this; it shows the realities from being on top of the world to holding on to your last knot on the rope. I'm at a loss of words for the rest of the movie, because the film-maker was able to capture just how real and brutal the world can be to someone down for the count.

The movie shows a bunch of famous figures such as Morrissey of the Smiths stating their appreciation of what the Dolls' back-to-basics rock and roll sound meant to them. Kane's life twists and turns from youthful fame to anxious depression to domestic abuse to a spiritual awakening and more, all of which gets depicted in an empathetic, understanding way. It's interesting to say the least to watch a rock star turned librarian (working for the Mormon church's research agencies, no less) attempting to perform again with his old band.
