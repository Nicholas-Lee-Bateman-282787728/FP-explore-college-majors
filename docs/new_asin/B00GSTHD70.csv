8627148,4,B00GSTHD70,"Here's a thoroughly enjoyable little film that takes a somewhat predictable course, but does so with visual panache & two very engaging leads. When ad exec Andrea accidentally finds herself stuck on the roof with Gualberto, the janitor she had rudely dismissed from her office earlier that day -- a Friday, meaning that the office building will be closed & empty until Monday morning -- the stage is set for two people from different worlds to meet as two human beings. In this, it's not unlike the basic premise of something like ""The Breakfast Club"" (for instance), as they gradually drop their defenses & open up to one another.

Andrea has clearly become a success-driven workaholic, alienating even her closest friend as she struggles to prepare a last-minute ad presentation for the following Monday. Gualberto had the desire to better himself, going to university to major in literature, before lack of money & unexpected fatherhood changed his path. What follows over the long weekend could easily be a weighty dialogue, but the film stays in more comedic waters -- yet not so much that it's bland. Their painful personal secrets aren't overwrought, and their developing friendship seems earned.

It's all aided by clever direction -- in one scene, they write a rescue note to put into a plastic water bottle, which they'll toss over the side to the street below -- and the camera tilts back & forth slightly, as if they were in a lifeboat bobbing on the sea, and we hear the cries of gulls in the distance. The tone is light but not sitcom frivolous, and it's only in retrospect that we realize how delicately the director has walked a very thin line, always keeping the emotional balance just right.

So, while it's a bit familiar, that familiarity is done up with real flair & energy. It's a pleasure to spend the weekend with Andrea & Gualberto, both of whom retain a bit of sarcastic fire in their dialogue even at the end. This is a comfortable film, but with a hint of sharpness inside the comfortable wrappings, very much a success in its unassuming way -- recommended!",1439164800,2,2085,4.770083102493075
