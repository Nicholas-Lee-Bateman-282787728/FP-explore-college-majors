7827512,4,6302538165,"This film is actually a Japanese import made by Nippon Animation that was dubbed in English and imported by Saban. The last two stories are from Nippon Animation's ""Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics"" series while the first is actually from the later series ""New Grimm Masterpiece Theatre"". Other names this series goes by include Grimm Meisaku Gekijo, Shin Grimm Meisaku Gekijo, and Gurimu Meisaku Gekijou.

For the uninitiated, both series have a cult following and are popular around the world. This tape is unique as it contains not one but three stories by this  company- three stories not released in English elsewhere!

Stories covered:  The Old Woman in the Woods (""Mori no naka no baasan""), The Worn Out Dancing Shoes (""Odori nui te boroboro ni naru kutsu"" ), and The Naughty Spirit (""Akuma to dai maou"" ).

OVERALL: We have three fairly accurate folk tales in one nice package. The colors are well-used, even atmospheric at times and the characters are well drawn. The animation is good for the time in general with some surprisingly good effects showing up. There are a few weak spots, mostly involving endings, but if you enjoy anime or folklore, I would recommend giving this one a try.

---Detailed Version (May be some spoilers)---

The Old Woman in the Woods is a good opening. The flashing lights seen during this film might be a seizure risk, but besides that issue the animation is good for the most part. The movements are smooth, the owl in flight is lovely even if not 100% realistic, and the goblin transformations really stand out! Sadly, there are a few obvious reused animations in this one which caused me to deduct half a star. The most obvious one is whenever the girl runs, which became irritating as she does a lot of running!

Story-wise, The Old Woman in the Woods follows the English folktale pretty closely. A noble carriage is attacked in the woods for disobeying the warnings that an old witch lives there and doesn't like visitors. The only survivor is a servant girl who makes friends with a wise owl who isn't what he seems. It has a very stereotypical happy ever after ending, but the ride there is not bad. I just wish the girl wasn't so helpless and at times annoying on the way.

The Worn Out Dancing Shoes is a nice follow-up. The animation is smooth, even if not as effects-laden as The Old Woman in the Woods was. As a trade-off for the more simplistic animations, mood prevails heavily with subtle changes in colors, blur/fade effects, and well-drawn for the time facial expressions really adding a lot to the story. There are reused animations here, too, but they aren't glaringly obvious. If anything, the reused animations are used cleverly to allow more use of what special effects this one has without breaking the budget.

Story-Wise, The Worn Out Dancing Shoes follows the folktale ""The Dancing Princesses"" fairly closely. The king's three daughters keep waking up exhausted with their dancing shoes in tatters. It's obvious they have been out dancing all night instead of sleeping, so the king tries to keep them from going out with no success. Frustrated, the king puts out a bulletin that whoever can stop the princesses from going dancing will get to marry one, but whoever fails will go to the dungeon. Yes, there's another happy ending, but there's a sense that the hero earned it which makes it far more satisfying than the Old Woman in the Woods was.

The last story, The Naughty Spirit, is 50-50 visually. There are some very detailed and surprisingly disturbing shots such as the lightning flashing through trees in a dark forest and the damned breaking rocks forever in misery, however, most of the backgrounds in the tower are dull and cheaply done which is bad as this mostly takes place in the tower. Any reused animations are limited and used to good effect. I honestly didn't notice them at first! The colors are mostly appropriate to the scene, though it doesn't evoke as much mood as The Worn Out Dancing Shoes did. The lopsided art on this one causes me to remove half a star.

Story-wise The Naughty Spirit is a hodge-podge of Christian myths about demons with a little Japan tossed in for flavor. Two soldiers decide to break orders by taking a vacation and drag a drummer boy with them as a guide to the area. The boy is hungry, scared, cold, wet and forced to endure physical abuse by the soldiers. In frustration he shouts that he would rather cast lots with the demon Beelzebub than be with those two anymore. The soldiers warn him that saying a devil's name can get their attention, but the boy doesn't care and keeps saying it until Beelzebub comes and drags them away using his magic flute. The rower-woman of the dead greets Beelzebub warmly and the two talk as they ferry the soldiers to hell. Apparently Beelzebub is in trouble, too: one more slip up and he'll never join the ""spectral council""!

I think it's weird that they translated demon to ""Spirit"" in this one as if it would remove that this is obviously about devils. There even are angels involved and a huge Deus Ex Machina ending with God beating the Devil. Even stranger, this choice was also in the Japanese version. Despite the ""spirit"" weirdness, Beelzebub is actually entertaining to watch. He's funny, not scary, and watching the loser try to beat the humans makes when he almost does kind of frightening. I normally would complain about the Deus Ex Machina ending, but it's actually accurate for the beliefs portrayed, so I won't deduct for it. It's a good solid tale overall and the little twist at the very end (past the Deus Ex Machina) is perfect.",1348272000,5,5598,4.717502558853633
