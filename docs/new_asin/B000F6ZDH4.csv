2553476,4,B000F6ZDH4,A good overview of one of our favorite cities. Definitely a keeper for reunion groups or families that head to Savannah to explore the city's past. Very informative and entertaining.,1409443200,3,182,5.1
2553477,5,B000F6ZDH4,I Loved it.  If you are a Savannah fan and don't currently live there lime me you'll enjoy the DVD.,1375142400,3,99,3.95
2553478,5,B000F6ZDH4,My 10yr old son is facinated by the Presidents and facinated by ghost/spirits.  This DVD combines both!!  He watches it and loves to share the scary facts with his friends and teachers.  I even learned a few new things!,1363046400,2,219,4.564102564102564
2553479,3,B000F6ZDH4,"I received this as a gift. I absolutely love Savannah, GA and love learning about it so I was definitely thrilled to have received this, especially it being a History channel documentary... but I've been more amused by the books I've read about Savannah than actually watching this. It wasn't bad by any means but some parts kind of dragged on, felt repetitive at some parts and Savannah has SO MUCH to offer I felt more could have been added to it.",1356480000,4,449,4.487804878048781

2553481,5,B000F6ZDH4,"Edinburgh has a long brutal history, and therefore, the claims to hauntings are many.  This DVD covers a wide variety of areas in Edinburgh that are rumored to be haunted, and gives first hand accounts!  You can't beat the History Channel!",1200355200,4,239,4.804878048780488
8118224,3,B000F6ZDH4,Kinda bland. I was hoping to hear more stories from right in Edinburgh.,1512172800,,71,4.538461538461538
8118225,5,B000F6ZDH4,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949

8118228,1,B000F6ZDH4,The cover is the Haunted History of Savannah but the DVD is The True Story of the Fighting Sullivans.  Not at all what I wanted.,1468627200,,128,4.12
8118229,5,B000F6ZDH4,It is a great start for planning for trip to Savannah!  It gave us an opportunity to highlight what we want to see there.  I love the visual pictures,1462060800,,149,4.103448275862069

8118231,5,B000F6ZDH4,"Interesting presentation of some of Hawaii's spoken legends, some of which are not well known. History Channel is known for a quality product and this DVD will not disappoint. If you're interested in Hawaii's history and culture, you will enjoy this DVD.",1459468800,,254,5.071428571428571
8118232,5,B000F6ZDH4,"OUTSTANDING!! All the legends of the Hawaiian Islands come to life in this well done History Channel program. From the goddess Pele near a Volcanic opening, to her appearances along roadsides helping citizens with danger ahead.
Ghostly Hawaiian Warriors from the past are seen walking through the jungles carrying torches or are heard singing in a nearby lagoon.
The owner of a high tree house lives alone in the forest and hears her name called loudly one evening when it's extremely silent outside.
To her surprise she responds and hears nothing.
The choking Ghosts are known to strike visitors as well as citizens of the Islands. Hawaii's Fire Departments are probably built right over their graves and the Captain just says they want to be known that they existed and are there.
Some history of the Islands are also talked about as to how it became the nations 50th state and the natives that lived there on different islands came together over several battles.

Another well done History Channel Haunted program from the series!!!! Highly recommended!!!",1439424000,2,1058,5.011363636363637
8118233,5,B000F6ZDH4,"OUTSTANDING! This is perhaps one of the very best of the entire series!
The White House is haunted. Abraham Lincoln is known to haunt the place where he was President during the infamous War between The States (The Civil War). His untimely assassination brought grief to a nation that was torn apart during the War and finally winning the peace, Mr. Lincoln knew it would take a long time to achieve. Dolly Madison is also known to haunt the US Mansion.
Mansions The Octagon, The Halcyon House are also discussed as well as several Hotels in which former President Ulysses S. Grant visited and is known to have a lingering smell of cigar smoke in the lobby, for which could be attributed to him.
Two Early American Colonists take a Duel, with one dying from his injuries. Both argued over sailors being ""impressed"" into the English Navy by having England ships come alongside American shipping vessels and boarding them.
A Battle Flag of the Confederacy flies in the window of a Virginia Inn. Union Troops proceed to come and and remove the Flag with the Innkeeper surprising them on the staircase and firing a fatal shot to the Union Officer. The Union Soldier accompanying his officer returns fire and hits the Innkeeper, killing him instantly. He is then bayonetted and kicked down the stairs. Both ghosts are known to haunt the Inn.
I highly recommend this one!!!",1439337600,2,1367,4.772151898734177
