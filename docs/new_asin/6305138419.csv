It explains everything in a simple and informative manner. However if you are up on all the comings and goings of modern aircraft then the info will be nothing new.  The footage is good, but a little grainy and not up to the quality of DVD. The biggest pain is the way they present the show. I think they were trying to be fancy and show off the interactive features of DVD's. But to stop watching one part to jump to a different section gets annoying. It would have been better to just put it together as one streamlined show.  But as it is pretty cheap I think it is worth the cash.",998006400,5,705,4.176470588235294

Is it because it isold single layer DVD format or what, somebody clue me in. I ... conclude that the quality is comensurate with the price.  I do not recommend this product. If I am in error I am open for e-mail at imak@jps.net.",964828800,3,337,4.333333333333333
7884149,3,6305138419,"The DVD has nice videos of the different American and Europian jets but the sound did not have any window rattling screams of the jet engines that I was expecting in DVD. Also very limited footage on the damage caused by  the weapons. The footage was exactly the same as we saw on TV during the  Gulf War, they could have cleaned up the images first (gotten rid of  vertical roll, noise, poor contrast). The HIS channel has better footage  and for screams from the engines I recommend Air Force 1 and Top Gun. Some  of the American planes discussed are F-111, F117, F15, F22 and F23, A10.  The HIS channel devotes an hour to each plane so it's easy to get spoiled.  I would not have bought this DVD based on what I know now.",918345600,13,724,4.279411764705882
