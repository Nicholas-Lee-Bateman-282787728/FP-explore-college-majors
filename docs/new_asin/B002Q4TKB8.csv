8443864,3,B002Q4TKB8,"Two kids while ditching school come across a mutant alien zombie who has just eaten all the cows in the field. They have a lengthy discussion on various diseases and what to do with the zombie, here in Pleasance, Australia.  The boy wants to use the zombie as they own private killer and feed it all the kids who have wronged them. That seemed like a nice plot for a movie, similar to ""Dead Girl."" However, the girl wants nothing to do with it, so she pushes her bf to the ground next to the zombie....soon he too will acquire a zombie foot drag. The movie then jumps around. The zombie population suddenly grows. We get to see stout alien leader, but the movie doesn't follow the core group of survivors as do most (all) zombie movie, but rather it is a connection of various human vs. zombie scene normally involving a topless or scantily clad female. Healthy amount of gratuitous nudity with shower scenes, strip scenes, and a topless vixen wielding a sword against zombies (something even Uma Thurman has never done!) Dialogue wasn't up to the cheese factor of a Misty Mundae movie, but they tried. Plot? Zombies kill people. Good camp factor, but seriously misses the mark as a cult classic.",1307923200,,1196,4.588785046728972
