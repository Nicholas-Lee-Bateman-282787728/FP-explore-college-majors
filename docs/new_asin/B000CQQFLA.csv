8598250,1,B000CQQFLA,"A friend got me this DVD years ago due to my undying love for Jonathan Frakes, but sadly this is the worst piece of garbage imaginable. There is some nice footage I must admit, and Jonathan Frakes is gorgeous as always, but the sound quality! You can literally make out only about 25% of what is being said. They play this music....so loud....which makes all the information given by the narrator inaudible.",1482969600,,407,4.666666666666667
