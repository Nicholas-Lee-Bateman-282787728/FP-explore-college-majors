4900039,5,B005X5MXM0,"Wow!! These mofos really kick out the jams. This is actually two concerts and and about four hours of nonstop hard rocking funk. They are a first rate show band and don't hold anything back. The video quality is very good for the time period, but the Rockpalast folks always do an excellent job. The sound quality is very good as well. I recommend this very highly.",1365552000,11,365,4.462686567164179
4900040,3,B005X5MXM0,This was a pretty tasty little concert with a great selection of Mott hits. MIck Ronson looks a bit under-used but its so cool to see him again.,1362441600,,144,4.178571428571429
4900041,4,B005X5MXM0,"I bought this purely on a whim and it's actually pretty good. A big show! Was never a big fan or knew much of their music but I do remember one tune from MTV - Edicott. Unfortunately and much to my surprise, this song is not on here...Video quality is not bad and is acceptable for the 80's.",1356393600,,291,4.0344827586206895
4900042,4,B005X5MXM0,"Good show to have for fans of Ian and Mick but both guys rocked harder with Mott and David rather than together.  Good show overall but not as energetic rock as one might expect from these two together.  Good example is Cleveland Rocks.  Ian played it in Chicago last October more enthusiastically (at age 72) than with Mick and band here.  Even the Drew Carey show version was more enthusiastic than here, but, just my opinion since I was there in Chicago.  Having a member of the Mekons singing backup didn't hurt?

I wonder if Mick, Ian and David Bowie ever shared the stage together?  Something tells me THAT would rock.

This DVD in NTSC format (shows ""Region 0"" on the cover thumbnail on Amazon but not the actual DVD cover) is only in Stereo but sounds OK enough to be passable.  Video quality is about as could be
expected from the period of 1980 but grainy.  The lighting on the musicians is not up to par but the camera angles are proficiently done without annoying aggressive changes in angles and zooms.

Overall a good thing to have of fans of this type of music.  Ian plays pretty much guitar with another guy on keyboards.  Ian also plays a cool ""double-rail"" guitar at times.

Kinda funny how great it is that the TV show captured a great segment of cultural history that can be treasured over the ages.  Glad some of the tapes survived.",1348358400,6,1353,4.487704918032787
4900043,5,B005X5MXM0,"This is an awesome DVD, and a rare gem of a find. I saw Ian Hunter in the mid-70's in Cleveland, and this took me right back. The video and sound quality are great for the period. Enjoy.",1347840000,3,186,3.9210526315789473
4900044,4,B005X5MXM0,"This DVD of Ian Hunter and the late Mick Ronson in a 1980 concert performance in Germany was originally recorded for a German TV network show.

It's a good representation of the Hunter-Ronson Band's stage show at that time and is well worth having if you're an Ian Hunter or Mick Ronson fan.

The camera work and video editing are good. The sound is also good although, to my ear, Mick Ronson's guitar is a bit too prominent in the mix and tends to drown out some of the other instruments in places. On the downside, this concert was recorded on video tape and the original tapes seem to have degraded a bit over time, so while the picture quality is quite acceptable it's not up to modern standards.

Amazon's page for this item doesn't include a set list so I'll include the set list here:

1. FBI
2. Once Bitten Twice Shy
3. Angeline
4. Laugh At Me
5. Irene Wilde
6. I Wish I Were Your Mother
7. Just Another Night
8. We Gotta Get Out Of Here
9. Bastard
10. All The Way From Memphis
11. Cleveland Rocks
12. All The Young Dudes
13. Slaughter On 10th Avenue

Overall, a worthwhile DVD for Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson fans.

Addition to original review: I see there's a CD version of this concert as well. If you're interested in a concert CD of Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson from this period, I'd advise getting Welcome To the Club instead of the CD version this one. This DVD is worthwhile but remember that the length of the show was restricted to fit into the TV time requirements, so this concert is shorter than the Welcome To The Club concert on CD.",1347580800,6,1552,4.2979452054794525
4900045,4,B005X5MXM0,"This is probably the best I've ever heard Ian Hunter sing live, and the band sounds good. However, I think I'd rather just have a CD of this, due to the look of boredom and annoyance on Ronson's face throughout. Ronson looks distracted and downright pissed off through most of this. I'm not sure what was going on, but Ronson quite obviously wanted to be somewhere else! So, 4 stars instead of 5.",1336694400,4,396,4.438356164383562
4900046,5,B005X5MXM0,"I am very pleased with this DVD. For the most part the quality is great, a few times when the camera position changes I get bars across the screen, not sure if this was due to the actual position of the camera or a production issue, but this was not a major issue as it is quickly corrected. I have only watched this on my computer and not a larger TV. I loved seeing Ian and Mick together again, I saw them at the Santa Monica Civic and two of the seven shows at the Roxy in Hollywood in '79, If I didn't know this was in Germany it could have been any of the shows I saw. I do wish this show had happened a couple of years later, then I may have been able to attend as I was in Germany in '82 and '83. The song set was great on the DVD, I loved seeing the shots of Mick and the close-ups of his fingers. This is the best quality video I remember seeing of Mick. I wish there was a DVD of Welcome to the Club that I could use to compare it to, am I missing something? I have told my friends about this and they are interested in purchasing this.",1335225600,9,1046,3.8472222222222223
4900047,5,B005X5MXM0,"Ian Hunter has always been one of my musical heroes and Mick Ronson, one of the original Spiders from Mars, was not only a fantastic guitarist but quite dishy. This DVD of a concert filmed in Germany is great. These two legends were meant to be together and Ronson's early death was a true rock tragedy. But now we have this DVD to remember this collaboration by. I know the same thing had previously been released on CD, but it's soooo good to have the visual as well. What a wonderful antidote to the &%@#!% that passes for music today.",1329782400,16,538,4.39

4900053,4,B005X5MXM0,Such an under appreciated performer and songwriter. The Rockpalast performance documents this line up in full glory. This is the tour that would bring the Welcome To The Club album -- with a twist or two. Great forward rocking stuff here... some may point to the glam era... I'd say more mod... either way it's good stuff. Would have been 5 stars but the mix was dicey in a couple spots -- mainly backing vocals. Doesn't take away from the overall brilliance.,1395360000,,459,4.609756097560975

4900057,4,B005X5MXM0,"Recorded in 1980, here comes another entry in the Rockpalast Concert Series. This time around we have the Ian Hunter Band featuring Mick Ronson. This is a full-screen presentation with decent stereo sound. Once again, we have the song titles at the bottom of the screen for the beginning of each song, which is annoying the first couple times, but you get adjusted to it during the concerts running time. The only buyer beware is some video distortion throughout the entire show. This looks like color bands across the screen, and while at first quite annoying, you almost get used to it. I believe this comes from the original television broadcast, and I doubt any sort of remastering processes could fix it. The rarity of the concerts in the Rockpalast Series makes this a worthwhile disc to own though. Let's see the history of Ian Hunter up to the 1980 period of this show.

[Wikipedia]
Ian Hunter Patterson (born 3 June 1939) is an English singer-songwriter. He was the lead singer of the English rock band Mott the Hoople from its inception in 1969 to its dissolution in 1974, and he again fronted them at the time of their 2009 reunion. Hunter was a musician and songwriter before Mott The Hoople, and he continued in this vein after he left the band. As the leading figure in Mott The Hoople, but facing ill health and disillusioned with commercial success, he embarked on a solo career, often in collaboration with Mott The Hoople's guitarist Mick Ronson, who was well known as David Bowie's sideman and arranger from the Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars period.[1]

Mott The Hoople achieved a certain level of commercial success and attracted a small but devoted fan base. As a solo artist, Hunter at times made the charts with lesser-known but more wide-ranging works outside the rock mainstream. Among his best-known solo records are ""Once Bitten, Twice Shy"" (later covered by Great White) and ""Cleveland Rocks,"" made famous from a cover version on the American TV series The Drew Carey Show.

In March 1975 Hunter joined forces with Mick Ronson; during his solo career, Hunter most frequently worked with Ronson until the latter's death in 1993. Hunter's first single from his eponymous solo album was the UK Top 40 hit ""Once Bitten Twice Shy"". Hunter and Ronson then parted professionally (reportedly due to Hunter's refusal to have to deal with Ronson's manager at the time, Tony DeFries). Hunter's second solo album, All American Alien Boy, was a more soul-infused work, featuring saxophonist David Sanborn, bassist Jaco Pastorius, and, on one track, Queen (one-time opening act for Mott the Hoople) on backing vocals. With his next album Overnight Angels (produced by Roy Thomas Baker and featuring former Bowie sideman Earl Slick on lead guitar), Hunter opted for a heavier guitar sound. Hunter's record label in America, Columbia Records, refused to release the album in the US. According to Ian Hunter, this was due not so much to dissatisfaction on Columbia's part towards the record, but to issues concerning Hunter's management at the time: ""Overnight Angels was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour - just before it was to be released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release it until I had new management and that dragged on until it became too late.""[14]

Mick Ronson returned as producer and guitarist on Hunter's 1979 album You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic, which also featured several members from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band as well as John Cale. Two songs from Schizophrenic became successes for other artists: in late 1979, ""Ships"" was covered by Barry Manilow and became a top ten US hit, and in 1997, ""Cleveland Rocks"" was covered by the Presidents of the United States of America (whose version was used as the theme song for The Drew Carey Show). ""Cleveland Rocks"" is arguably Hunter's most enduring solo song; it is seen as a de facto anthem in Cleveland, Ohio (sometimes used as a victory song for the city's sports teams) and Hunter was given the key to the city by Cleveland mayor Dennis Kucinich on 19 June 1979.[15]

The only bonus feature on the DVD is a trailer for the Ian Hunter Concert. There is a nice eight-page booklet that comes with the package that has some nice photos and some good information in it. Grab this if you can find it, because I believe that these rare concerts are a treat for music lovers of all tastes.
