8222861,3,B000WE5I4W,"god bless her, she tries.
Dont get me wrong, Ashley Tisdale has a wonderful voice. the problem is not in the singing but, as with Vanessa, in the songs. there is not much to sing about in these songs.
I much prefer both of them in front of the camera. they are much better actresses than singers and I do wish Ashley would stretch herself in more challenging movie roles as Vanessa is doing. Ashley is wonderful with comedy and comedians are the best actors in drama. Wildcats really wasn't aimed at me but the cast were decent enough just a premise that couldn't be maintained. More movies please.",1393113600,,598,4.495412844036697

8222863,5,B000WE5I4W,This makes tisdale really shine in her ways of singing. the vidoes are excellent and the moves are moves that anyone can learn even if they say they cant dance. the behind the scenes are funny to watch and can make you laugh and it shows that ashley is a normal person just like everyone else,1196640000,10,292,4.232142857142857
