671887,5,6303471714,"i've been using this tape on & off for about 8 years. it works the bits it should, they ache and then u start and look great. no prancing around like some chicken on heat, just concentrated reps and sets targeting  all those essentally ""dangerous"" areas for the female form! It's  not too fast, in actual fact once u do this everyday, it's counted too  slow. as for ""unsafe"" - where? i always feel stronger in areas  previously weak e.g. lower back, so ignore that! (just don't push til it  burns, reduce the amount of reps as recommended!) looking at cindy's figure  throughout actually motivates me as she isn't a stick insect but has the  body I want and can aim for (apart from the extra 5 inches in height  unfortunately!) and the music is good, although if i had one dig - bring  out another tape of similiar format, 2 new workouts and newer  music...everytime i hear ""crazy"" by seal now i'm constantly  reminded of kicking my legs in the air!!!! and one more thing - YES, for  the first 2-3 days after the first workout don't be surprised if ROBOCOP can  walk better than u can!! It hurts!",934934400,42,1096,4.42
672051,5,6303471714,I was looking my best when I used this in my workout plan.  I rotated these workouts with pilates and yoga dvds and I had was in shape and looked great in a bikini.  After all these years I'm using this again along with pilates and jogging because I need that cardio.  This is the perfect amount of strength training.  I suggest getting different sizes of weights and some leg weights. With that addition I see no reason to pay for the gym.,1484524800,2,440,4.265060240963855
672052,4,6303471714,"It's a very good workout but BE CAREFUL. She's young, strong, and a little crazy.

- Be careful with launges, do it to 90 degrees, don't pass your toes with your knees.
- Be careful with head rolls, do it slowly and better if you don't go back too much when you roll it. Turns shouldn't be violent.
- Do it slowly, specially back work, knee work, and neck. They are all delicate.
- Don't drink often. Drink some minutes before and don't do it during the workout.
- Rest more. Stop the dvd often.
- Add to this workout some back exercises. This lacks a lot of them. Just lay down looking down, hands near your head bent, try to move your upper body up, so that your back needs to pull. Or look for something similar.
- Add to this workout slower and longer stretches. She does it too fast. You need more stretching on arms, and more time on each exercise.",1484524800,3,854,4.2073170731707314

I like this workout because it is pretty low impact, works your whole body, strengthens your core and is fun. It will sneak up on you though! You don't think it is that hard the first time you do it and then you realize how hard it is when you feel it the next day! The good thing is that you feel it in all the areas that you want to though! ;) It firms and tightens you in all the right places.",1484352000,2,547,3.849557522123894

I still like it, it's surprisingly effective. Non-traditional cardio without jumping, do-able for those trying to get back in shape or for a fun alternative. I like the music and production style. You have to use good judgment in doing the moves a little more carefully than Cindy does, because she doesn't always use the best form - but it's good as a workout companion, if you have some basic fitness knowledge.",1463961600,8,588,4.4036697247706424
672056,5,6303471714,"Let me start by saying that I HATE working out. I don't like gyms, and exercise classes become too boring after a while,  so it's hard for me to ever stick with a routine. I probably need a personal trainer, but can't afford one on a regular basis. Having tried numerous classes, DVD's, and types of exercise from aerobics to yoga and everything in between, I was well versed enough to be able to follow the exercises with proper form. This particular video is produced like a music video, with changing scenery, gritty music, and a real workout feel, as opposed to most of the boring videos out there. The workouts are challenging, yet effective. I have tried this on and off since it was first released, and it is always my go-to workout if I need to shed a few pounds and tone up. There is a free version on youtube. You may want to slow down some parts of it, especially the stretching part, which are some yoga moves but too fast to really work. This is honestly the only exercise video I always go back to, because IT WORKS!!",1454284800,5,1031,4.369791666666667

It lacks the frilly, overzealous ""You can do it! Kick your legs!!"" nonsense that a lot of other videos have (I'm looking at you, Denise Austin), and the reps themselves are challenging and straightforward.

I don't understand the criticism to the camera work...It cuts to different angles to show you form and mix it up a little, but it's not confusing, unless you think the form for barbells or leg lifts is suddenly going to change halfway through...?

It doesn't have a ton of cardio and the ab set on the second workout is a little repetitive, but the arm and legwork is excellent on both.

Add to that Radu's expertise and the amazing Primal Scream soundtrack...It's great.  Basic, unfrilly, great.",1403654400,6,860,4.516129032258065

It is aesthetically pleasing to watch and the music is great to listen to, so you are motivated to keep coming back to it.  It is a fast, thorough, and effective workout. Radu doesn't mess around!

672344,5,6303471714,"I LOVE this video. I first came across it about a year and a half ago, when my neighbor and I decided to start working out together, as we just didn't have a ny motivation or have any fun doing it ourselves. We alternated between the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, Tae-bo, and this Shape Your Body workout. I fell in love with this work out video the first time we did it. Unfortunately, our working out together was short lived as I soon became pregnant with my third child.

Fast forward 16 months. My son is now 6 months old, and I'm ready to start getting in shape. As my neighbor has now moved, and her copy of this video was in VHS form, I headed on over to Amazon to see if I could find it on DVD, and I was very excited to see that it was available. I ordered this DVD, and also Cindy's Next Challenge workout, which I haven't tried yet.

I did this tape for the first time again yesterday, and I was so happy to discover that it is truly as fun as I remembered it to be, so much fun in fact, that I enjoyed myself even without a partner to do it with. One of my favorite things about these workouts is how Cindy takes breaks, and reminds you to take a sip of water, and tells you that if you can't do the entire set, then to find your comfortable level, and just do that many. Another awesome thing about this is that the moves are SIMPLE.You don't have to watch the video 5 times before you can figure out the moves. I woke up this morning, and oh good lord, are my thighs sore. It was tough doing workout two today, because both workouts have leg work in them, but it is worth it.

I haven't been doing this long enough to see any results, but I'm hoping that doing these workouts everyday, and eating healthy, that I will soon see results.

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into shape at home, without any gimmicks or unnecessary moves. Every move you see on this DVD is effective. The only downside is that each of the main workouts are 40+ minutes long, so it's you're going to have to have a good chunk of time set aside in order to do this everyday. I'm a stay at home mom, so it's easy for me, but if you work long hours, or are just very busy in general, these workouts might be a bit too long.",1393286400,3,2234,4.070454545454545
672345,5,6303471714,"I used to work out to this video years ago.  After trying some of the workout videos out there today, I decided to upgrade my long-lost VHS copy to DVD and re-visit Cindy's workouts.  I haven't been disappointed.

That being said, Cindy really flings herself around, and you had better be darn careful doing this so as to not injure yourself.  And I thought the ab workouts were dangerous for the back.

So, I have mixed emotions about this, and will probably just use parts of the workout (legs and buns) and nix others completely (I definitely will not do the ab workouts).",1393027200,,518,4.364583333333333

672538,5,6303471714,"I have owned this workout video for so long(feels like 20 years?). I know it has been criticized for some moves, but if you know the workout basics, you can do it correctly without hurting yourself.  Only one move I don't recommend for many is the full sit up.  If you have good stomach strength and good back, you eventually reach the point to do it right without hurting yourself.
 I love this workout in general because it has a lot of movements using the leg joints around the bikini line.  In western world, they don't talk about much, but that area is very important for lymphatic system flows.  These moves this video has work a lot on those, I feel.
Also, I like that it's not a typical aerobics, but you get your cardio worked up good.  I think it's suitable for a home workout because you don't jump up and down.
 This video is fun to watch and I love the music.  To me it beats those boring aerobic routines.  But amazingly it is tough workout.  If you are not fit, you body will be aching first.  Though if you continue, I guarantee you will look good.  I think this workout is aimed to make you look good, rather make you feel good.  So if you want just a good feeling, refreshing workout, this video is not for you.  If you want to work hard and look good (not bulky, or masculine), go for it.

Since there are 2 separate work outs you won''t get bored. And a mini work out if you are rushed. Few work out videos offer this great quality and results!

It is not a jump around twist an ankle video.  The exercises are smooth, controlled, and precise but done at a fast enough pace that you'll be sweating and loving it all the same. The exercises can be altered to your fitness level, you can certainly vamp up the intensity by adding weights, she uses 5 lbs ..I use 10 to 15lbs.

I keep coming back to it when I've gone lax and need to get in shape again.  The more I've learned about fitness over the years, the more I have come appreciate what Radu has done here. You get the perfect amount of higher interval training (mostly in the 2nd workout), combined with strength/resistance training.  I never get bored, and I don't say this just because Cindy looks good! What's great about Cindy is that it's like working out with a girlfriend - there's a girl-next-door niceness to her - not the condescension you sometimes get with workout video people.  She's really quite lovely.  Yes, all the safety concerns they say about this workout are true - you can't fly around like Cindy does and her form is awful sometimes.

In this Dvd all the exercises are explained they tell you exactly what an exercise is for and how to do it properly...
At the begining the exercises are really hard so is better to take time and not rush in doing them all since the first time.

The specific exercises target my muscles in such a way that I see and feel the effects immediately. I also find that the exercises stretch me in such a way that I feel a sense of balance when I'm done with them. (Not to the degree of a yoga class, but still great.)

Then I started out slowly by doing just the ten minute workout for a week.  After that I felt ready to do the longer ones but then only as many reps as I could handle.  After it ceased to be as challenging I increased the weights and concentrated more on slow control.
Yes, you will be sore, but never a bad sore.  I was so proud to feel that way--I knew I had had a good workout.  And the reason I knew I hadn't damaged myself is because I never hurt(as opposed to burn) when I did the exercises, and I always felt good when I was done.  Interestingly enough the more sore I was, the more necessary I felt it was to exercise again.  And doing that always made me feel better!

When I saw Cindy doing the same work out exercises I used to do for gymnastics (which gave me a great shape), I knew I was on the right track (my sister says some were from her ballet practice as well). In this first video she does go a little fast from one set to the next, but that's why they invented pause right?

If you don't feel like going to the gym, but want to get a solid 40 minute work out at home without having to be ""peppy"" or watch some one who is ""peppy"", I highly recommend this workout.

I will however say that if you know where to engage, and use total core control, it can be fun and beneficial. Radu and Cindy do not give enough cues on safety and muscular engagement. If you know how to take care of yourself by not pushing and relying on momentum, then take it for what it is---a creative workout (I have seen far dangerous dvd's in today's market).

673040,5,6303471714,"I first got this on VHS when I was 14 and started doing it every single day (the two alternating workouts). I had heard about people supposedly getting injured doing it, and was warned not to do it by friends, but I never had a single problem.  I got into amazing shape, my cardio fitness was very good and I felt so good after each workout.  My core strength and muscle tone were great.

At 18 I stopped, cause I got lazy, put on a lot of weight and at 28 have just started doing these workouts again.  My tips to others would be: do as is advised and drink lots of water and rest between sets and repetitions; only do the number of repetitions you can manage without pain - don't stress because it does get easier and you will be able to do them all eventually; and be sensible.  Obviously if you throw your body around like it's made of rubber you will hurt yourself.  Do the exercises slowly and carefully, at least until your fitness and strength improve.  If you find you cannot keep up with the pace of the video/DVD, just pause it until you can catch up and then resume watching.

These are great workouts you can do almost anywhere and it annoys me when people criticise it.  Probably because it's Cindy Crawford people find it easier to pick on it, but I have never been in better shape or felt better than when I did these workouts regularly.",1235088000,9,1353,4.2952755905511815

3. The music is real music, including ""Crazy,"" by Seal.
4. Cindy Crawford is HOT and more fun to follow than some of the cheesy instructors I have encountered on many a workout DVD.
4. There are 2 workouts to switch off every other day.
5. They are only 45 minutes, easy to fit it.
6. It is NOT CHEESY

Buy this.  It is hard, it will make you sweat, it will make you feel good.  A lot of the moves are ballet based from barre work, they lengthen and strengthen.

The DVD does tend to run fast, but I still took it at my own pace and slowed down when I felt it appropriate.
The switches in scenes make the video interesting, but Id love to see a whole video taped on the beach, as I felt the pace was more appropriate.

I myself developed a very bad knee problem because of this video that lasted for months. The video is too fast so it doesn't strengthen your muscles, just puts a lot of stress on your joints. Cindy's form in this video is pretty terrible, particularly in lounges, where her knee goes way over her toes.
I use this video occasionally for abwork and stretches, but when I do use it, I don't do the reps as fast as she does.
Instead of this one, I would recommend the sequel to this video (New Challenge) which is quite decent.",1219795200,4,623,4.370689655172414

673171,4,6303471714,"I work out 4-5 days/week and consider myself at an advanced level. I frequently change my workouts from yoga to running to weighlifting to cardio in order to avoid bordem and fitness plateaus. I had bought the Next Challenge Workout when I was in highschool about 15 years ago so I was pretty excited about getting Cindy's original tape. I think this workout is pretty challenging and I felt sore the next day. I think the repetation and the fast pace is great for increasing heart rate and building muscle without bulk. Unfortunately, Cindy and Radu have sacrificed proper form for a fast pace. I had trouble keeping up with Radu's count and not because of muscle fatigue. I think its impossible to do some of the moves correctly at the pace that he was counting. That is evidenced by the fact that while Cindy keeps pace with Radu's count, she has very poor form in some of the exercises (esp the abs workout).

Anyway, I would not recommend this to anyone but an advanced athlete who already knows proper form. Also, should you get this tape, I would encourage you to go at your own pace. Instead of 20 sit-ups, do 16 but with correct form. Other then this, the tape is very well made, the scenary (including Cindy :) is beautiful and inspiring. Finally, I highly recommend the Next Challenge tape, which has a manageable pace but is super challenging (much more challenging then this tape).",1206403200,3,1394,4.620967741935484

You may want to build up to Cindy's workouts though, I used Mr Loud (aka Tony Little) as I was very out of shape again. I mix them up, both of Cindy's real workouts, not her last one!!, with Gilead's ABS workout and Tony's Advanced Body Shaping to get myself in shape...

At the time, it was way over my head - so I have to say it's not a beginner friendly sort of workout.  These days I do it all the time - even though it's now 15 years old.  As ""Celebrity"" workout videos go - it's very good.  Cindy Crawford leads the video, she's not just there while the instructor leads, and even waves Radu off a couple of times when he tries to interrupt her instruction. (It's actually very cute without being sassy.) There is minimal instruction - which I have come to prefer as I have advanced through higher levels of excercise videos.  Video's that give lots of detailed instruction on form and placement are great - this is not one of them.  You start the workout from the beginning of the warm-up and go straight through to the cool down. She does remind you to watch your allignment, but doesn't go into great detail about what that is. Other revievers have given excellent breakdowns of the sequencing - so I won't.  There are short water breaks, which is really nice because you have the feeling of working out with her instead of having to miss a little bit of the workout. It is more toning based - which is what the title indicated - it's a shaping video.  There is a little cardio benefit, but it's not the main focus of this video. The second workout is my favorite because of the long ab sequence. The ""leg flinging"" mentioned in the editorial review is actually very effective strength training for the legs which maintains flexibility and elevates the heart rate at the same time - it's similar to excercises I've done in dance classes and seen my husband do for martial arts.  Overall, this is a great workout, there are lots of us who still do it even after all these years.",1180656000,10,1814,4.377976190476191

673332,4,6303471714,"I have been working out with this video for years and can assure you, you WILL see results very fast by doing this program 2-3 times per week. However, if you are someone with injuries, be aware that you will have to do fewer repetitions, and adjust your form on several of the exercises so as to prevent further injuries to your back, knees, and neck.

If you have not worked out with a personal trainer or gone through physical therapy to learn proper form for exercising, I would not recommend this video. You must know the limits of your injuries and be willing to make adjustments to Cindy's routine so as to not further your injuries. I very much recommend her standing workout for arms though. It is fantastic and tones you VERY quickly. Cindy is great. The music is upbeat and you don't feel like she is talking down to you. She reminds you to take lots of sips of water, and even more importantly, to breath while exercising. This is important for obvious reasons, but even more so for those of us with back, neck, shoulder, and knee injuries...we tend to hold our breath and push through the pain and that is really harmful! The body needs oxygen to heal those hurting muscles!!!

Anyway, do buy the video! It's fun, Cindy is enjoyable to watch, and she certainly inspires you to work hard to get a body like hers. Just be careful and go slow at first. Do half of the number of repetitions that Cindy does and work your way up. If any of the exercises cause you immediate pain, DON'T do them. Modify that particular exercise. Instead of doing full-sit ups that strain your lower back, just add an extra set of crunches. It's as simple as that. Modify the routines on the exercises that irritate your injuries and catch up with her on the ones that don't. You CAN do this workout if you have injuries, you just have to listen to your body! Don't push through the pain...just modify your routine and enjoy the results; you will be seeing them rather quickly!",1168560000,,1966,4.4735376044568245

673337,4,6303471714,"This was the very first workout tape I ever bought.  I was sixteen, and I really wanted to get in shape so that I could make my high school dance team.  I knew NOTHING about proper form, tempo, intensity--you know, all the things that are so important in a good workout.  But once I popped this tape into the VCR, I was hooked! I did the routine day after day; and at the end of the year, I got picked for the dance team!  I was definitely sore a lot, but I never experienced any injury.  (Ah, youth--it truly is wasted on the young.)

Flash forward fifteen years.  I was surfing Amazon a couple weeks ago, looking for a new routine to add to my home workout library, and I came across this old gem.  I grew instantly nostalgic, but after reading the negative reviews, I was VERY hesitant to purchase it.  I didn't recall it being such a bad workout, but then again, I didn't know anything back then.  Still, I thought, ""What the hell?""  and decided to review it with new eyes (and a much less flexible, 30-something body).

What do I think of it now?  Well, it's true what they say about Cindy--her form is pretty bad throughout the workout!  It's a wonder that she didn't pinch a nerve flinging her head back so far during the warm-up, and I seriously don't know how her knees held up all those years doing lunges so poorly.  Beyond the bad form, she races through the exercises so quickly that it's almost like you're watching the video on fast forward!  I can see how a viewer (especially one who is an inexperienced exerciser) could injure him or herself by imitating Cindy.

That said, this DVD has some great exercises that you won't find anywhere else.  I love the unique lunges and the leg swings, and I also like the abdomnial work.  I feel powerful and sexy when I do this workout, and I love the fact that Cindy doesn't try to ""encourage"" the viewer by saying things like, ""C'mon--you're almost there!""  In fact, she seems to struggle through the workout as much as I do, which is its own kind of encouragement.  I also really like the music she's chosen--it's both enjoyable to listen to and the right tempo to perform the reps in time to the music, if you like doing that sort of thing.

The trick with this workout is to keep your remote handy and pause often so that you can do the exercises with proper form at a slower tempo.  Even if you don't feel like hitting the pause button, you can still get a great workout by doing slightly fewer reps in the ammount of time alotted, focusing on form and working in a safe range of motion.  You'll still be sore the next day, just not hobbled.

In sum, I like this workout, but I would NOT recommend it for the novice exerciser.  The risk of injury is just too great if you don't know how to modify the exercises to workout safely.  In fact, I'm amazed that I never injured myself doing this workout as a teenager!  But if you understand proper form and you don't mind doing the exercises at a slower tempo than Cindy, you can really get a lot out of this DVD.",1163030400,14,3020,4.316163410301954

The music in this video is really good. Obviously, some of the exercises are probably not recommended, such as head rolls backwards and she does lunge with her knee past her toes. However, do the exercises in proper form, I was lucky enough to learn proper form in gym class. Also, there's a lot of reps packed into a short amount of time, so at times, I pause it between sets so I can take an extra min. to finish at my own pace. The reason why I keep coming back to this video is because it is pleasant to watch, the men in the house will probably watch it with you, and the results speak for themselves. Everytime I do this video 3x a week I see and feel major results. Obviously, don't hurt yourself and throw your back out, don't look to Cindy to have perfect form, just let her lead you through exercises you already know and modify them to fit your fitness capabilities if they're dangerous.

Released several years ago, this work out was ahead of the pack, if you ask me.  There are strength and Pilates-type moves integrated into this workout, which also elevates the heart rate somewhat as a bonus.  I think it's the perfect combination between lengthening/stretching type moves which studies show are quite productive, and traditional strength moves- also necessary to reduce body fat and tone up. In fact, I know of no other workout DVD (and I have many, many) which have this combination.  And it's so fun to do.

The reason being is I am more experienced at working out.  I took 2 years of kickboxing which taught me proper technique for everything. Now Cindy's workout is a good workout rather than hard because I pay attention to my technique.  I don't recommend this workout for a novice.  It is too confusing.  But for anyone who  has been working out for years and wants to work off that stress - this is your exercise routine!,1118966400,3,580,4.162162162162162
673504,5,6303471714,"I love this video (in spite of the safety criticisms) as well as Cindy's second video because they are more geared towards the types of workouts you would participate in as an athlete.  I've never enjoyed aerobics (okay, I actually hate them!), but these exercises remind me of the sorts of conditioning exercises we'd do in basketball, softball, and volleyball practices growing up.  If you were someone who enjoyed those types of workouts, I'd recommend this video.",1117756800,2,467,5.0519480519480515

I do my Hardcore Kickbox Circuit by Janis Saffel and Guillermo Gomez first for my cardio sessions and then I do the Cindy DVD, alternating the 2 workouts that are in it. It's an awesome workout, period. I didn't listen to all the negativity Cindy recieved because of her form. You decide you yourself, just look at how many stars people have given it. I highly recommend it.",1116460800,,395,4.5
673506,5,6303471714,"This is a great workout that ties everything together, leaving you with a feeling that you've worked your whole body, not just your arms, legs, and abs.

673507,5,6303471714,"I'm not sure what drives all the negative reviews. I've started using the tape of this workout when I lived in a dorm in undergrad school, and it (fairly quickly) got me in the best shape of my life. The workout is, indeed, challenging, even after using it for a while. I've never had an issue with any injuries while using this tape. I didn't need to lose weight, but I did need to tone up, and this video helped tremendously. It's been a few years since I've used it last (the tape belonged to my roommate), and I am grateful to find that it's out on DVD. I'm looking forward to returning to this workout set (which can't be said about too many workout videos), and I know it works - I've seen the results before. The leg workout, in particular (ladies - I know it matters!), literally kicked my (...) - away. That's where I always gain weight first, and the exercises are very challenging, yet very effective.

It's always true that watching your form during exercise is important, but I've never thought there was any issues with the form Cindy uses in the video. Just be careful, as with any other exercise program.",1114992000,2,1120,4.436893203883495

I purchased both Tamilee Webb's ""I want that body"" and Cindy's dvd, and it only proved to me once again how much I love her workout. Whereas Tamilee does work your buns off, Cindy's is actually both fun and effective! It works all the parts of your body, keeps your interest piqued and is performed both indoors and outdoors which breaks the usual monotony of exercise videos. Besides Cindy is a pleasure to look at, she just looks strong and toned and not like a stringy walking muscle which a lot of the fitness instructors suffer from. She performs the whole workout alongside you and you can see her sweating and breathing hard and it's kind of encouraging in an odd way. The effects are amazing - I am not a slouch, but I still have to rest a lot in between the sets if just to catch my breath. You shape up really fast with this one!",1114214400,,972,4.311475409836065

This video was the only thing that saved me.  A really, really good all around workout, it helped me stay toned, without having to do a alot of cardio type exercises that I couldn't do at the time.

I still use it every few weeks, when I don't have time to go to the gym or do any kind of outdoor exercise.  The music being used is excellent as well; Primal Scream, Revenge, Smithereens, and Seal.

I know there is alot of flak about this video, but thats probably because most people are lazy a**es.

Praise to Cindy and Radu!!!",1112227200,6,666,4.288
673510,4,6303471714,"Shape Your Body was Cindy Crawford's first workout video, which she created in collaboration with personal trainer Radu.  Shortly after its release, it was criticized for containing dangerous moves, largely because Cindy sometimes shows poor form and often moves much too quickly through the exercises; however, experienced exercisers who know how to modify should not have any problems.  The video contains 3 strength-based workouts:  a 45-minute workout focused on stretching and toning your legs plus working your buttocks, chest, back, and abs; a 40-minute workout aimed at building power and strength in your legs plus working your shoulders, arms, and abs; and a quick, 10-minute full body training routine using no equipment.  Because the first two workouts target different muscle groups, they are designed to be performed on consecutive days, while the third workout is meant as a short bonus for days that you don't have time do more than that.  The style of these workouts is high repetition, low weight training; you definitely don't have time to switch to heavier weights between the various exercises.  Radu provides voiceover instruction for the first two workouts and occasionally appears on screen to adjust Cindy's form; Cindy herself also makes frequent comments throughout the workouts, which are filmed in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings to a pop soundtrack.

The first workout begins with a 6-minute warm-up containing fast-moving stretches.  The next 12 minutes focus on standing leg work:  you'll do a series of ""leg swings"" while holding on to a chair for balance and moving to the front, side, and back (these are sort of modified ballet-type movements).  You then perform a lunge combined with a front kick.  The leg swings and lunges are repeated for a total of three sets of each.  Next, you'll move to the floor for 4 minutes of buttocks work, again doing a tri-set:  pelvic lifts lying on your back with your heels on the chair, leg lifts lying on your side, and leg lifts back from an all-fours position. Moving on to the upper body, you do 3 sets of 10 push-ups.  Next comes a lying tri-set of flies, chest presses, and lat pullovers, again repeating for 3 total sets.  Continuing with back work in a standing position, you do a 1-armed row, a standing double row, and a seated row tri-set; total time for the upper body portion is 10 minutes.  Last comes 7 minutes of abs work, and in this segment, Cindy moves particularly fast.  She performs crunches, a full sit-up, reverse curls, and a side jackknife for 3 sets of each.  The workout ends with 5 minutes of lying and seated stretches for a total of just under 43 minutes.

The second workout begins with a 5  minute warm-up that is virtually the same as in Workout 1.  Again starting with the legs, you'll perform an interesting side lunge series in which you lunge, lift, and turn, raising your back leg.  This is combined with a plie squat, front lunge, and regular squat, with the entire series being repeated for 3 sets.  To finish of the legs, you do just 1 set of leg swings from each of the 4 positions, bringing the legs segment in at a total of 9  minutes.  Next comes the 9-minute arms segment.  Here, you'll do 8 different exercises (bicep curls, barbell press, flies, triceps kickbacks, reverse curls, shoulder press,  front raise, French press), repeating the entire series 3 times total.  Finally, there is a 9-minute abs section in which Cindy performs a variety of crunches at a lightning-fast speed; in fact, the moves are better thought of as pulse rather than crunches, as there is little time for a full crunch.  The workout ends with a 4.5 minute cool-down stretch and comes in at just under 39 minutes.

For the last workout, Cindy is instructing alone without Radu.  She does not use any equipment and is not even wearing shoes for this segment, but she addresses virtually the entire body in this short 10-minute workout.  After a few quick warm-up stretches, Cindy begins with the legs, alternating squats and lunges for a total of 3 sets of each.  Moving to the floor, she performs 3 sets of 10 push-ups using different hand positions.  Next comes the abs work, and Cindy uses 4 different crunches to target the upper abs, obliques, lower abs, and entire midsection.  Finally, she does some pelvic tilts to work the buttocks, and the workout ends with a brief stretch.  I would rate these workouts as at an intermediate level and above; they would not be a appropriate for beginners who would be unfamiliar with how to modify the moves for safety.  The exercises included are varied and interesting and I felt thoroughly worked out after each session.  Despite these positives, this is not a video that I am interested in doing on a regular basis, mainly because the extremely fast pace made the workout feel more like a chore to me; I prefer Cindy's A New Dimension, which moves at a slightly more reasonable pace.  However, if you are an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser who likes performing high repetition strength training workouts at a quick pace, you may enjoy these workouts.  Overall, I rate the video as 3  stars.",1111104000,79,5148,4.831050228310502
673579,5,6303471714,"I bought this workout when it first came out. I saw a change in one month I lost 30 pounds. I was satified with my results. I feel inspired to workout with the video. I know lots of friends who have barrowed the video and seen the results as well. I wasn't trying to ""look"" like her but wanted to lose weight and look fit. The music kept you going. Its almost like you move to the music. It makes working out fun.

The short workout is great if you are in a hurry or just want to maintain the weight and your physical apperence.",1109376000,5,528,4.0285714285714285

I ran sprints for 3 miles a day, biked 1 hour at 18 mph's on a stationary bike and did this video. It improved my strength soooo very much!  I don't recommend that you start out doing this tape to the full reps etc. if you are out of shape - start out with no weights at all if you are out of shape and build up.

don't listen to the B.S. that you are hearing that its UNSAFE. learn the exercise first slowly and then do it.  I have just purchased it on DVD and can't wait for it to arrive at my door.  I just LOVE IT!

673581,5,6303471714,"Yes! Her workouts are challenging. This video unjustly got hit with negative reviews just because some number of folks, likely VERY out of shape people, showed up at a chiropractor for back injuries. Of course they will have back injuries if they, instead of starting slow, began vigorous exercise routine right away.  Some also claim that Cindy is not performing the exercises correctly. If that was the case, don't you think that she would have back injuries as well?

The workouts are designed to give you a nice combo of cardio with weight training. YOU WILL BE SORE each and every time. If you are a beginner you must take it slow. Also, a note for guys: you can use this video too, just use heavier weights.

Have fun with this workout. You WILL shape up.",1107734400,8,761,4.580882352941177
673582,3,6303471714,"OK, I have mixed feelings about this workout...like ALL of Cindy Crawfords workouts (The Next Challange, and New Dimension). I have all of them because I think that the workouts are well designed...BUT you have to know something about fitness to do these moves correctly and for the best results. Cindy consistantly does the exercises incorrectly. If you follow her, you may end up injuring yourself. She has had RADU and Kathy Kaehler, both fitness experts, but apparently they did not teach her the value of lifting weights correctly. Cindy also consistantly makes little comments that just annoy me. So, I think that if YOU take it upon yourself to do the moves correctly, this is a great quick supplemental workout, but if you are not sure how to lift weights and are just starting a workout routine, I would try another video first. I do these videos when I don't have time to get to the gym, and I know they have changed my body, but I basically turn it on and do the workout in the way that is best for me.

I've noticed a couple of poor reviews for the cheesy video production but it's really not all that bad- I've tried some that were a lot worse.  I think Crawford and her trainer offer a down-to-earth style that I can relate to and which makes the workout bearable.  It never fails, if I haven't done the workout for awhile and start it back up, I am sore everywhere for days.  But the effort is worth it.  After giving birth to my son, I was able to get a great body back!  The exercises target areas for excellent toning and don't add bulky muscles.  I recall not working out for quite some time and noticing that my [...] seemed to have gone completely flat.  A few months of this tape was like having a [...]-lift.  I've always thought the video was aptly named, ""Shape Your Body,"" delivers.",1105401600,5,906,4.288235294117647
673584,1,6303471714,"Here is a video I am would recommend to no one. Do not bother recommending this to people you hate, too cruel. From the beginning in the video Cindy does the moves wrong, bending her back wrong, stretching her legs too far, twisting her whole body fast and the list continues. You spend the whole video saying, ""Wouldn't that hurt doing the exercise like that?"" Actually the beginning starts with one of her Revlon commercials talking about her lips. You later see two more commercials.

 Her trainer ""Radu... Known as New York's toughest trainer,"" as described on the video specks too fast, you cannot understand what he is saying, has an annoying voice and talks over Cindy countless times. Because he helped make these workouts it shows he does not know what movements work and which movements hurt you.

Back to Cindy she never says anything like, ""good job."" She finishes the workouts saying ""and that's it."" With other videos I always have a smile when I have been working hard and they say ""good job."" Those words never come out of Cindy's mouth. Also you know when you are getting tired from an exercise and just want to give up? Other videos they encourage you to finish by saying things like ""Come on only three more you can do it!"" When you hear that you know you can finish. Again Cindy is not encouraging.

Last by not least this video was only made to sell. Cindy claims she has used this workout for two years and I have a hard time believing that. Some excises she does wrong, some hurt you no matter how they are done. She wears what makes her look sexy, her stomach is flat, she has her hair hanging down flopping in her face, The screen goes to black and white so the only white you see are her shoes, socks and bra guess where you look when that happens. Cindy was trained to do this video and never did this workout again I am guessing. Imagine at our time an exercise video of Britany Spears. This is a video more for men who want to see a ""sexy super model"" workout. Enjoy guys!

I recommend one of the Billy Blanks workout videos instead of this video. Does not matter if it is beginner or advance all of them help. Billy encourages you to work your hardest, he explains the instructions very well, the steps are easy and the movements help you not hurt you.",1105142400,9,2282,4.423809523809524

I have recently stopped working out and am trying to get into shape again, I have pulled out this tape to do it with. I remember being able to get through the workout with 5 lb armn weights, I am back now at 2 lbs!! I know that this tape will get me back into shape in no time. IT REALLY WORKS, ITS HARD BUT AFTER A FEW WORKOUTS IT GETS EASIER AND YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE.",1102896000,2,614,3.8046875

It's true, some jerky movements could injure somebody who isn't used to exercise, and the movements are performed fast. But it seems to me fast things or things that use momentum, if done safely, just work the body a little differently, not ineffectively.

The previous reviewer is right on the mark to compare exercise trends to diet trends. Those of us who have followed exercise commentator advice for decades can well imagine how today's trends would have been panned by experts in 1992. There were such exaggerated concerns about balance and people falling and hurting themselves during movements, I recall. Can you imagine the screeching from experts in the past if experts on every new show were telling beginners to do strenthg moves while wobbling on a balance disk or while leaning precariously back on a big ball?!  Suddenly it's ok, and recommended, with not a peep from anybody about the safety of it. The point being that just like with the diet end of things, the experts will always be changing their minds.",1098662400,6,1167,4.888888888888889
673587,5,6303471714,"This workout video changed my life.  In combination with a diet and workout daily with this routine I lost over 100 lbs and took 10 inches off my waist in about six months.  I did this workout daily for over one year and never had ONE injury and my back never even hurt.  I find it highly unusual that, as mentioned in the amzon.com review, 12 people with back injuries went to the same chiropractor.  I don't know if the fitness ""experts"" who reviewed this workout are jealous, envious or what.  The editor Joan Price mentions in her amazon.com review, ""She presents one after another of the exercises that fitness professionals threw out of their routines two decades ago.""  I imagine exercise routines are just like fad diets.  What all the ""experts"" and professionals considered effective and a must do today is out tomorrow.  Remember bran muffins? Eat them or die.  Whatever happened to that?  Oh, everyone's on Atkin's now.  I don't care if the routines in this workout are two decades old.  THEY WORK.  That's all that matters.

I had never used weights in my life and started off with 5 lbs weights and gradually over the months worked my way up to 15 lbs weights.  When you first begin this workout you will not be able to keep up with Cindy.  You'll definitely have to pause and rewind a lot when you first start so keep the remote close by.  But keep at it and eventually you'll be able to keep pace with Cindy.

673630,4,6303471714,"I don't know about Joan but i thought this workout was good. I first had doubts after i first viewed it because it seemed like it wouldn't work but then i gave it a try. And guess what? The next day my body was all soar and when going up the steps i was like ow ow! LoL And my abs are actually more fit now! =D I have to admit that her form is really bad because she flings herself a lot and has very little control, which is bad for your back actually. But now that you know, during the workout just don't fling as much and control your back.
There are three workouts in this tape. The first workout is 45 minutes long. It starts out with a warm up. Then, they go into exercises that are supposed to stretch and tone your lower body with a lot of leg movements standing up. Then, you work on your arms. You do 30 pushups (with a stop after each 10). You work on your chest and back and your shoulders with weights in this one. Then, you work on your abs with two sets. Then you have the cool down.
The second workout is 40 minutes long and is suposed to strengthen your muscles. You do sets of three in this workout. You start out with a warm up again. You start out with strengthening your lower body and a couple of flings from the first workout. Then you do HARD arm workouts. (and i mean HARD lol) Then you go to the abs again and a little butt workout and then a cool down.
The last workout is a mini 10-minute workout without weights. You basically do pushups, situps, warmup, cooldown, and some leg exercises. So that's pretty good.
Honestly i think she does some of her exercises WAY too fast so you can slow it down a bit if you like. And don't fling yourself so much, remmeber! My fave workout would have to be the second one. Cindy is a great down-to-earth trainer but just needs a little control in her movements. THis workout is mainly for advanced beginners to beginning advanced.",1076025600,7,1895,4.166212534059945

Infact 2 girlfriends and I started eating right and doing this video 6 days a week and we lost a combined total of 200 pounds in 6 months. Not bad! We liked the fact that there are 2 workouts with different emphasis and a short 10 minute one (if you can stand watching her in cutoffs and a skimpy top.. ug) for when you're in a rush. They are short sets and it makes it manageable by switching to different areas- just when you think your legs will fall off.. you're on your back doing some abs and butt work. It's not technically perfect and if you're not careful you can hurt yourself, but we took it slow and eventually turned Cindy off and turned the tunes on and did the sets from memory. We have all been doing it for 3 years now and we have't found another program we enjoy more. If you start feeling like you've mastered this one, move onto the Next challenge.. It will certainly coninue the challenge. Oh.. and one more thing.. it's fun screaming obscenities at the t.v. and making fun of some of the moves.

Besides that, the workout is pretty well structured with Cindy's trainer, Radu. It's filmed in multiple settings like the beach, in a studio, on a rooftop... Some of it is in black and white and there are multiple songs throughout the workout. Overall, both workouts remind you of an early '90s music video. Oh yeah, there are three workouts. The first two are about 45 minutes and the third is a 10 minute ""Jump-Start Mini-Workout"".

If you are a beginner than this may not be for you...depending on your motivation. She is even sweating, taking water breaks and whining to her instructor at times.

I am not as fit or lithe as Cindy is, but I can follow the routines confidently and fairly smoothly...the end result is that I feel good after my workouts.
The moves are fairly straightforward, and the music soundtrack that accompanies the routines is soothing yet upbeat.
Don't let the fact that her workout wear is comprised mostly of little skimpy bodysuits and Daisy Duke cutoffs sway you or make you feel negatively towards her - I wear yoga pants and a tanktop with a shelf bra and footie socks. Comfy, simple, real.
Give this workout a try!

673637,4,6303471714,"I think Cindy's NEXT CHALLENGE is the BEST workout tape I've ever used.  It is now out of print and hard to get, so this has most of the same moves.  What I don't like about this one is the pace.  The count is VERY fast and I feel does not allow for full movement... she and Radu seem to be rushing to include everything.  I think this is the 1st one they did, Cindy seems more gauky and immature, and it is amuzing to see some scuffling between the two, almost a parent & teen relationship. This is actually funny to watch. Cindy is doing a lot more pouty sexy hair tossy things in this one, so maybe the guys will like it more.  Sexier & faster.  It IS a very strong workout, it is just my least favorite of the three.  I LIKE the repetitions... most of the moves are done as a group, then you repeat the group of movements two more times, so you don't get too tired, but you really work.  I don't usually have days when I'm raring to work out at top speed.  When I do, this is the one I'll use.",1060214400,5,997,3.969849246231156
673638,5,6303471714,"I have owned this tape for years, and what I like about it is that instead of being intimidated by Cindy, she became a source of inspiration.  I owe so much to this tape for starting my new life of being an in shape person.",1059264000,,223,3.9555555555555557
673698,4,6303471714,"I have had this video for years, and it is still my favorite.  There are some exersizes that can hurt you if you do them wrong, but anyone who works out should know that your knees should never go past your toes, full sit-ups can hurt your back, etc.  It is very easy to substitute safe versions of each exersize.  It is a very effective video, and I am considerably more tone and fit.  Best of all, it is not boring or cheesy--which most videos are.",1055203200,2,450,4.1976744186046515
673699,5,6303471714,"I first went to Radu's gym about fifteen years ago.  I started up again a few years back, but then switched to a job that was on the other side of town and just couldn't make it.  I remember hearing he had made a work out video with Cindy Crawford and Voila!, quickly found it at a video store.

I LOVE IT!!!  It was just like the classes, so I knew I made the right choice.

Every so often, when I realized I wasn't getting enough excercise in my daily routine of life, I'd start using the video again.

Radu is really a very tough trainer.  No kidding, he doesn't mess around.
Knowing this, if you haven't worked out before or in a long while, start with the 10-minute routine first.  Some reviews say how sore everyone is in the beginning - start with the 10-minute workout.  After you're comfortable doing that for a week or so, move on to the 40-minute workouts.  (Switch between the 10-minute and a 40-minute one if you're still too sore?)  This last time around, I did the 10-minute one for about 4 weeks.  (I began working at home and was dearly out of shape!)  I then moved onto the 40-minute routines.  After about a week or so of those, my boyfriend said ""WOW!  You look great!  You really are doing those workouts every day, aren't you?""  I don't know if it's the first 4 weeks of the 10-minute routine and then the 40-minute ones or just the 40-minute routines that made enough difference for him to notice, but it was still enough to make a difference.  I'm no longer tired doing the simple things.
Even if you're a workout fiend, you're still going to be challenged with this video.

As for one posting saying doctors have seen patients with back pain after using the video...  Isn't it a long since known fact to consult a physician before beginning any type of workout regimen?  If that same person went to a fitness class, the instructor would have noticed they were straining and had them slow down or stop.  You have to use your own best judgement when you do it yourself at home.
I cannot recommend this video enough.  I guess there's a reason they say it's sold more than any other workout video.

The music doesn't get tiresome and some of the excersises for the same body area alter enough so it's not boring.  The changes between black & white and color and the different backgrounds also keep it interesting.  Add that to the fact that the routines aren't so ""wild"" that I can't do them in my tiny NYC apartment living room make it just the perfect fit.
After so many uses, the tape finally went ""snowy"" this morning, hence I'm on this site to buy a new one - along with the follow up I hear has long since come out.  Stick with it and you WILL see changes.
One last thing - I used canned soup and later liter sized bottled water as my ""weights"" for years.  You don't want to be so sore in the beginning that you can't lift your toothbrush the next morning.",1054771200,26,2883,4.338317757009346

Plus the music is great!  The reviewer cites back injuries, etc., but IF you know how to exercise correctly, you can avoid arching your back, keep your knee aligned with you foot when lunging, etc.  The exercises are too fast for beginners, but go at a reasonable pace to start and work your way up.

MUSICAL CHOICE is not the usual instrumental used in most videos; her choice is similar to her other video. Credits of musical selections are listed at the end, most songs performed by Primal Scream, Seal contributes ""Crazy"", ""Ice"" by Daniel Lanois, ""State of Shock"" Revenge and ""Dis Moi Dis Moi"" by Mitsou.  It's unique and refreshing.
ALTERNATE DAYS - The video is incorporated to do on alternate days. The nearly 100 minute tape is structured in two separate workouts. Workout I- 45 minutes is focused on leg work, use a chair, swing the legs this way, that way, back, front, etc. This ""legwork"" isn't usually done in most other workout experts, but it is very effective. She then continues a vigorous workout with buns, abs, chest (with small weights). Workout II is similar with concentration to the arms and shoulders, and more abdominal work.
MINI WORKOUT - 10 minutes. This is done to get a real quick workout when time is essential. This is a challenging workout! I recommend it to anyone. It isn't difficult, it is just about getting to do it to make it easier! .......MzRizz.",1023408000,31,1450,4.882113821138211

Critics deemed it risky, unsafe...well I can tell you, it works, shows results immediately, and makes you feel so good.  You'll use muscles that never get used, and you'll see your body tightening up right away.  I started college and didn't keep up with the tape, and sadly lost all my hard work.  I'm back again, with little time, and little $ to join a gym, so I'm doing this tape again, but need to purchase a new one, the old one is worn out.",1021766400,4,556,4.216981132075472
673785,3,6303471714,"You will definitely get strong and buff when you work this tape, but BEWARE: it's not a good cardio workout and I did not really lose weight when doing this tape. I did, however, get very strong and muscular. That was very empowering. But I did not lose a lot of weight. My suggestion would be to alternate this tape with walking/jogging/running. And another thing, the side sit-ups made my waist thicker. So keep that in mind when doing the side sit-ups. Also, the side stretches in the beginning sometimes thicken the waist, too. Other than that, it's a fast work out. Do it if you want to get muscle. And what they say about her form is sort of true. Her form isn't perfect, but if you're in decent shape and don't get aches and pains easily, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Just maintain the form yourself and realize she is doing it very fast. If you keep that in mind, you can just maintain the correct posture and form yourself. If you are used to doing one of the harder tapes from the Firm series, for example the Susan Harris tape, then this will seem rather easy to you. I do this tape when the prospect of doing the Firm is merely too much for me and makes me want to run under the covers and hide. On those tired days, I try a workout like this. That way, I am getting some exercise, but I'm not too drained. For beginners, this will be a hard tape, though.",1020816000,6,1377,4.239543726235741

What i don't like about this tape is the first section in workout 1 i mean leg swings? I doubt they do that much for you. Also cindy moves way too fast and experts always tell you to move slower to get the full range of motion otherwise you are using more momentum than muscule which we all know won't get you toned. Also another important noat this is a toning excerisce video NOT a cardiovasclar video. Even though your heart will get up a little don't excpect to count it as a fat burning session.
Also i should point out some things i like about it also. This is a great workout for people new to toning very effecive arms and abs routine. But just go at your own pace. If you go as fast a cindy you might be cheating yourself.",1016841600,,906,4.038888888888889
673787,5,6303471714,"...  I got this tape shortly after it came out.  Granted, when I first started using it, I was an active sixteen-year-old, so I wasn't as affected by possible injuries.  But I took a long time off from this tape, and just started working out again about three weeks ago.
Using this tape in conjunction with Cindy's two other tapes, I have already seen results- even though I'm nursing, and I can't cut back on calories as much as I'll be able to when my daughter is over a year old.  I've lost 5 pounds so far, and my energy levels are amazing.
Yes, some of the moves go a little too quickly for some people.  This is not meant for people who don't already know the correct postures to take when exercising, and who need reminders when working out.  But the intro pretty much states that- that this is a workout meant for healthy people.
Although I took off nearly ten years from using this tape, I got back into the tape very easily.  I do all the reps that she does, but it's not necessary.  If you prefer to go slower, you can- Cindy even states throught the video that you should only do what you feel comfortable doing.
There are two great perks to this video, the first being that there are three different workouts.  The first two each last about 40 minutes, and they focus on lots of lunges and kicks, along with reps with barbells, followed by ab work and stretching.  They are good to use every other day... The third workout is a 10 minute mini-workout, great for when you feel the need to exercise, but don't have the time to do a full workout.
The other perk is that, although Cindy is a supermodel, she voices some of the same disgruntlement with working out that most of us do at home:  she frequently admits that the reps coming up are hard, but that they are effective.  It's more like having a friend in the room than a cheerleader.
Perhaps if you are prone to joint problems, you may want to pass up this video, or rent it to see how well it works for you before you buy it...",1015545600,5,1995,4.276595744680851

I made it to about the middle of the toning section for the legs and couldn't believe how out of shape I really was. There was a time that I could do both 45 min routines back to back 3 days a week (you definitely need to alternate with a cardio routine on other days-this is strictly a ""body shaping"" tape)! I love this workout, it does get the job done and Cindy doesn't sugar coat anything about getting there either. I believe that this tape is safe so long as you have a good understanding of making modifications in some of the exercises and doing the abs section in a more controlled manner(which works the abs better anyway).
