3946274,1,B002LFPB0G,I was not happy with this DVD because all it showed was a fire place.  I was expecting to see a christmas concert for IL Divo.,1304726400,17,126,3.8461538461538463
3946275,3,B002LFPB0G,"There was alot of background noise on this DVD.  Il Devo has such wonderful voices, but they did not come through clearly because of the muffled sound in the background.  I have a CD of the same songs (Christmas Collection) as were on the DVD. The clarity of the singing on the CD is so much better than the DVD.",1297209600,,312,4.183333333333334
3946276,4,B002LFPB0G,"The music is great but we were disappointed that it wasn't actually a video of IL Divo
but scenes of holiday fare.  We always look forward to watching them sing in concert, whether in person or on DVD.  Happy holidays to all.",1288915200,28,225,4.333333333333333
3946277,5,B002LFPB0G,"THE CHRISTMAS COLLECTION (Yule Edition) by IL DIVO is like playing the CD on you television screen. The Christmas scenes are beautiful.  It's great as a party background, but would rather it be a DVD of a concert; seeing the guys actually performing the songs. We are avid fans of IL DIVO.  Anything they do is wonderful.  Mike and Dianne Gibbens, Louisiana",1264809600,11,357,4.725806451612903
3946278,1,B002LFPB0G,Bought this for my wife thinking it was a concert video of Christmas songs..it turned out to be a Christmas recording with pictures of burning fireplaces etc.. I should have read the liner notes before I ordered..Gave  it away to a person we are trying to make Ildivo fans..Bought the new video also and we are delighted with it..maybe my mistake..,1262822400,9,348,4.704918032786885
3946279,2,B002LFPB0G,"The music in this album was very good, but I was disappointed that it was not a ""Live"" concert. The use of only three winter pictures to accompany the music was a surprise to me. If I had known that this was not a live concert recording,I would not have purchased the DVD. I could have gotten the same music on a CD for less cost.",1262822400,4,330,4.015151515151516
3946280,2,B002LFPB0G,"I ordered this DVD for my wife.  She has the ""non DVD"" version and wanted to see them sing.  This was in Our Opionon a rip off and I should have read the reviews before ordering.  Just three scenes, no Il Divo's.  Now we can play at the same time on both stereos.",1262044800,4,263,3.9056603773584904
3946281,4,B002LFPB0G,"This is an interesting idea, although not a new one. There are three different scenes you can have on the TV while listening to Il Divo sing. You never see Il Divo, just the three scenes (burning fireplace, inside cottage scene, cabin in the snow). I like the burning fireplace. It's an actual video of a fireplace going. The Il Divo music is excellent. The only thing I can't understand (and the reason I didn't give five stars) is why ""Over The Rainbow"" is included in a Christmas album. It has absolutely nothing to do with Christmas, never has, never will. I checked all my other Christmas CD's and none of them include it. Maybe they needed it as a time filler, but I think they could have found one more actual Christmas song instead. Il Divo does a fantastic version of Amazing Grace which would have been more in line with the rest of the music, instead of a non-Christmas show tune. All in all, if you like Il Divo (I do, I've seen them in person), you'll like this DVD. Especially if you don't have a fireplace to run at Christmas time.",1261958400,6,1046,4.396907216494846
3946282,3,B002LFPB0G,"I preordered this because it said it was a DVD.  I mistakenly assumed that it would show Il Divo singing their Christmas collection.  Now I find that I'm given a choice of yule logs, snow, or some other silly picture.  I love this music and listen to it all year.  It's beautiful and I can't say enough about the songs.  My favorite is Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
So if you want to see Il Divo as well as listen to them.. you don't want this DVD.",1253577600,47,446,4.1395348837209305
3946283,5,B002LFPB0G,"Not released yet but not affraid to recommend  IL DIVO  These men have voices that are blessing for any time of the year but a wonder for this Holy of Holy times.  Blessings on you IL DIVO  Thank goodness for music that will last thru the test of time. Visions of IL DIVO, not sugar plums fill my dreams....yumyumyum!",1251849600,2,317,4.322033898305085
3946294,3,B002LFPB0G,It would have been a definite 5 star if it were an actual concert and not just the songs.,1422835200,,89,3.736842105263158
3946295,1,B002LFPB0G,I thought this would be a live concert - not a picture.,1421020800,,55,3.6666666666666665
3946296,5,B002LFPB0G,"I love IL Divo.  This DVD features the world's greatest Christmas music set to your choice of three heart-warming holiday scenes.  The Yule Log DVD lights up the holiday season. Perfect for entertaining, these songs and scenes instantly bring the good cheer and magic of Christmas to any holiday home.",1419984000,,301,5.0
3946297,2,B002LFPB0G,"I obviously didn't learn my lesson from my purchase of IL DIVO : A Musical Affair (Deluxe Version - CD+DVD) which wasn't what we assume a DVD is either. I also should have read the reviews. Just a slow learner I guess, but than this one was just a DVD. Not so much. It amounts to a CD that you can't download and three holiday scene pictures you can look at while you listen to the music. The only positive is that the music is wonderful as usual.",1419206400,4,447,4.090909090909091

3946300,2,B002LFPB0G,"I thought the DVD would be watching Il Divo sing, but all you see is a crackiling fireplace scene, or two, or three and only hear Il Divo sing.",1415232000,,143,3.9655172413793105

3946304,5,B002LFPB0G,"I knew that a Yule Log DVD is actually Christmas scenes etc....with background by the artists.....so I was not surprised or disappointed  that it did not show Il Divo singing..have given several as gifts
Can hardly wait till they come to Phoenix , Nov 2016",1386806400,,256,4.688888888888889
3946305,2,B002LFPB0G,I didn't realize that  It was the same as the CD. I thought I was going to see IL Divo perform the songs. It was not clear in your preview,1361750400,,138,3.6
3946306,5,B002LFPB0G,"One of my wife's favorite group.  A recommended buy as a gift or for yourself.  If your wife likes these singers, buy it for her, and make her happier during Christmas.",1359072000,,168,4.387096774193548
3946307,4,B002LFPB0G,"It was my fault, I thought this was a new Christmas album from Il Divo as I already had this CD.  The yule log, etc. were okay, but I wasn't really interested.  The album is excellent.",1356998400,,184,4.083333333333333
3946308,5,B002LFPB0G,The dvd was a gift  we saw them in Boston . There songs are just so great  if you have not heard them this would sell you on there singing . I have all there cds and dvds. I belong to there fan club. THEY ARE GREAT.,1356566400,,215,3.5531914893617023

3946312,1,B002LFPB0G,"We absolutely love these guys. We were really disappointed that it was a still DVD and not action performance. To watch them in
live performance makes you feel that you have left this planet and gone to HEAVEN. We would have ordered a CD instead of a DVD had
we known it was still. We will by them again and again,but check closer on what kind of DVD it is.",1325289600,,357,4.114285714285714
3946313,2,B002LFPB0G,"I just love hearing Il Divo sing, but when I received this Yule log DVD it skipped from the very beginning and throughout the entire DVD.  I played it on my laptop and it played perfectly. My DVD player is fairly new and I have not had any problems playing other DVD's.",1323648000,,269,4.173076923076923

8372810,4,B002LFPB0G,I love it!! The music and Il Divo voices are absolutely fantastic. The only thing I was disappointed with is the 4 men in the group were not on the screen singing the songs. Had I known Il Divo were not going to appear on my screen singing the wonderful songs; I would not have bought this DVD.,1514073600,,294,4.086206896551724
