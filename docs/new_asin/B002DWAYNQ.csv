3913632,5,B002DWAYNQ,"Bought this set for my boyfriend for Christmas. He was very happy to see the 4 discs in one set, as we had not seen that anywhere else. All cases were the same size, one disc for each movie. Haven't had any issues playing the movies, will update the post if any arise. Overall very pleased with the purchase.",1325894400,10,308,4.237288135593221

If you like super hero movies, you should definitely buy it. Its a great gift for a holiday or a birthday. Do not buy it if you like action or don't understand super hero movies.",1325462400,3,318,3.7611940298507465

3913636,4,B002DWAYNQ,"Minus one star for calling it a ""quadrilogy"". That isn't even a word. Thanks 20th Centuary Fox for making the world a little stupider. The word you are looking for is ""tetralogy"".

3913638,5,B002DWAYNQ,"First of all I was shocked that I could find a collection of ALL the four X-Men movies I was looking for in one set.  I was assuming all this time that I would have to buy Wolverine separately.  Each movie looked fantastic in its blu-ray transfer, and it has renewed my interest in the X-Men series.  The boxset was delivered to me lightning fast, not to mention it was a very reasonable price for all four of these movies. The only thing I was slightly dissappointed about was that the casing for Wolverine was the slim casing while all the others were standard blu-ray design.  I would've preferred them to be all the same size. But whataya gonna do?  That's up to 20th Century Fox! ;) Overall, I'm quite happy with this experience.",1320278400,31,734,4.447761194029851

I had no idea that I would not be able to watch this here in the USA when I bought it.  it may have said something about that but it wasn't straightforward and I am ticked that I wasted my money.

Which means that it will not play in most AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS - So it has to be Region 1 or in NTSC Format to play in American dvd players. I have looked closely at this because I have made mistakes in the past, so where are the American Versions of these discs in the COMPLETE Boxed SET.

 I already own the first 3 in boxed sets and don't really need the new one but I might want to get this one anyway and sell the other ones to reduce clutter.

3913679,5,B002DWAYNQ,there is such a difference in blu ray and dvd...highly recommend getting this on blu ray...enhances the experience...fun to watch!,1356480000,,130,5.55
3913680,4,B002DWAYNQ,"I will start off by saying that if you enjoy the X-Men Trilogy and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, this is a great set for a great price.

The overall audio and video quality of the films themselves are what you would expect from a blu-ray transfer.  The video is in full 1080p and the video quality itself is great.

Audio is again, what you would expect.  5.1 surround sound and crisp, at least, from what I can tell.

The movies themselves are good movies.  The original X-Men being the best of them by far.  As viewers go through the rest of the trilogy and, even through Origins: Wolverine, the overall quality of story and visual effects seem to diminish.  The stories are fairly good but, also seem to have less and less emotional punch as well.

That isn't to say that the movies are not enjoyable and that they do not give the viewer some sense of the comic characters albeit, without the same level of background as the original comics themselves.

My only major issue with the series are the degradation of the visual effects.  In the first X-Men, Wolverine's metal claws are almost indistinguishable from real metal when they are actually CG.  However, in the later movies they appear false-looking and almost cartoonish.  X-Men Origins: Wolverine goes even further down that path with bullet ground hits being done both with actual squibs (miniature explosions) and also with very noticeable CG right along side them.

While I enjoy movies for what they are, certain elements of them bug me.  I can enjoy a movie but still take issues with parts of its production.  CG is a big one for me.  If a producer is going to have practically created ground hits and try to make CG dust hits indistinguishable from the practical ones.

Either way, this set is well worth the money spent on it.  It has plenty of special features, behind the scenes and of course, the picture and audio quality a viewer would expect from blu-ray.  My family has immensely enjoyed it and appreciate the shelf-space savings the smaller slip cases give us.",1356134400,,2033,4.673239436619719

3913683,1,B002DWAYNQ,I bought this item and was super excited to play it on my big screen when I realized that it doesn't play on my dvd/blue ray.  It's a diverse dvd player but this dvd set is British standards that doesn't work in the US.  My brother was to play it in his computer by changing some settings.  This is very limiting.  I'm very dissappointed.,1354665600,2,338,4.234375

3913685,4,B002DWAYNQ,"I enjoy these movies very much, and they had a sufficient number of special features to make the purchase cost-effective.

On the other hand, I did have trouble loading the third disc into my Bluray player.  I contacted the Seller, and he said it is possible that my machine is obsolete.  I bought the player last Black Friday from a reputable electronics store, so if it is my player, I am sorely disappointed in the machine.

3913688,4,B002DWAYNQ,"In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed named Stryker to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a ""cure"" is found that makes all mutants human.

Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the ""cure"" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.

All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films (unless you're watching all of the movies in one sitting!). New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. Acting is 5-Stars. Movies are 5-stars.

Then along comes X-Men Origins: Wolverine. This movie, while entertaining, didn't live up to the excellent standard set by the first 3 movies. It was cool to see Wolverine's origins and all, but I sure hope that they don't take the franchise down an origins path for all of the other X-men characters. I see on IMDB that there's already a plan for Wolverine Origins 2. I'm not excited. In fact I'm bummed that the plan isn't for another X-men movie as of today.

If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) this set is a great opportunity to see the 3 original classic tales in chronological order and to own a kind of bonus movie. Wolverine Origins is totally worth a viewing...the others are keepers and classics in the genre.",1349049600,,1667,4.546666666666667
3913689,5,B002DWAYNQ,"I really liked the X-Men films.  Fun action and mysterious characters.  I'm glad Wolverine's history was filled in.  Unfortunate some characters get killed off without fulfilling some of their stories from the comic books.  Deadpool is killed, but is he really dead?  Different actors playing Sabertooth can be confusing.  Especially when the ""look"" is so different.  I could watch all four in a day often, if I had the time.",1344384000,,425,4.985714285714286

3913693,1,B002DWAYNQ,"If you don't know anything about the comic book, enjoy it. Its a great series.

If you know anything about the series, grab a barf bag.

Hollywood did there work changing the series to their liking, perfect example, movie 3 Juggernaut was affected by the character whom eliminated mutant ability. That would be fine, if Juggernaut was a mutant. Cain Marko found a gem called Cyttorak gem and turned into Juggernaut, which in turn doesn't make him a mutant. They also skip the part of him and Xavier being step brothers. Minor detail to leave out.

I am not by any means an expert, but if you google x-men, you can learn a thing or two.

The only highlight to the series was X-men Wolverine, but then the CG claws are the worst. The movie itself is great. I cringe when I see the claws in the mirror scene.",1338336000,2,805,4.382550335570469

3913697,3,B002DWAYNQ,"Fox has a wildly inconsistent track record with the production of their Blu-Ray discs. Some play perfectly and have dozens of extras; others are bare-bones and have issues with playback.

For true fans of these films, I'd recommend purchasing the single discs, since these apparently lack the extras on the others, but I will concede that the packaging is quite cool.

As far as the films themselves, here comes my two cents:

1. X-MEN (2000) - This was a real game-changer for Marvel properties being made into films. It showed that not only could a big-budget superhero film from a Marvel Comic (previously DC Comics characters had gotten the big-screen attention from the Burton/Schumacher BATMAN films and the SUPERMAN films) make a lot of money, but it could also be made quite well. While the film does unfortunately spend far too much time on the X-Men's most popular character Wolverine (played by then-newcomer and veteran of musical theatre Hugh Jackman) and one of its least interesting characters Rogue (played by the annoying pre-TRUE BLOOD Anna Paquin), it does well with the team interaction: The adversarial relationship between Cyclops (the horrifically underrated James Marsden) and Wolverine; the attraction between Jean Grey (the lovely and talented Famke Janssen) and Wolverine; the fractured friendship of Professor X (Patrick Stewart in a chair) and Magneto (the wonderful Ian McKellen). Director Bryan Singer also works in some fun fanboy references to other X-characters in this film. Singer is obviously very much in love with our heroes and our villains. Being an openly gay man, Singer found a definitive parallel between himself and the feared and hated and misunderstood mutants, and uses that as far as the structure of the scheme hatched by Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants (superficially played by Rebecca Romjin as shape-changer Mystique, Tyler Mane as the feral Sabretooth, and Ray Park as the agile and obedient Toad). Singer made some terrfic casting choices in this film (particularly Jackman, even though he wasn't Singer's first choice), with the exception of Halle Berry as Storm. She's never been particularly good in anything, she's REALLY not good in this film, and it doesn't look like that's going to change. The set pieces, with the exception of the final climactic fight on the Statue of Liberty and the Train Station sequence, aren't really there, but that's forgivable since this is the origin film and there has to be a lot of exposition. Singer keeps the film moving at a good tack, and makes the film a lot of fun. 4/5 stars.

2. X2: X-MEN UNITED (2003) - This is a much deeper and more meaningful film and an all-around better experience than the first film. With the addition of some new mutant players (a larger role for Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake/Iceman; the wonderful Alan Cumming as the flamboyant Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler; Aaron Stanford as the seething John Allerdyce/Pyro; the lovely and physical Kelly Hu as Yuriko/Lady Deathstrike) and a vital human villain (the always great Brian Cox as Col. William Stryker), Singer once again returns to the director's chair and expands the cinematic universe of the X-Men and allows the film to work on more levels than the first film did. The outsider element is much more at play here since instead of Mutant vs Mutant, it's Mutants vs Humans with Stryker representing our fears and our bigotry. Using the Maguffin of a mind-controlled Nightcrawler (in a stunning opening sequence) to attack and almost kill The President, Stryker gets authorization to invade The Xavier Institute and capture the mutants there. He also captures Professor X (and Cyclops, again relegating his screentime to almost nil), puts him in a forced hypnotic state, and intends to use the deus ex machina of the mutant-detecting computer Cerebro to have Xavier kill all the mutants on the planet. This of course causes hostilities between The X-Men and The Brotherhood to be set aside as they reluctantly join together to stop Stryker. There is also a small but very important sub-plot about Jean Grey's powers becoming increasingly difficult to control which will naturally come into play at the most vital moment. At the time this film came out, this was arguably the best superhero film yet made, aside from Richard Donner's first SUPERMAN film. It set a new standard, showing that not only could a superhero film be incredibly exciting, but it could be very layered as well. X2 really expands and improves on every facet of the first film: The set pieces are more dynamic (from the aforementioned opening to the invasion of the school to an airborne getaway to the assault on Stryker's base); the performances are better, the characters are more fleshed-out, and perhaps most importantly, Singer's subtext works on a more immediate level and is best demonstrated in a scene between Bobby and his parents as he reveals that he is a mutant. The ending was also powerful in a way that had never existed in a superhero film before and as an ancillary benefit, started a trend that continues to this day in superhero films: the post-script hinting at what's coming next. It's definitely the best of the X-MEN films and deserves to be on the list of one of the best superhero films of all time. 5/5 stars.

3. X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006) - This is BY FAR the worst of the X-MEN films. The reasons are almost too numerous to list, but I want to highlight the biggest reason of all. Bryan Singer got the opportunity of a lifetime to direct a sequel/reboot of SUPERMAN that was scheduled to hit theatres in the summer of '06. It was something that was even closer to his heart than the X-Men, and he announced his desire to make that film before he returned to the X-franchise. Tom Rothman, head of production at Fox (and a very petty little man), somehow determined that this was a betrayal and decided to rush a third X-MEN film into production without Singer at the helm, pretty much out of spite. Rothman also made the mistake of hiring hack director Brett Ratner to fill Singer's shoes. With Ratner at the helm, the film was destined to fall apart under the weight of his inexperience at dealing with, not only an event film, but an ensemble film. He had already attempted this in 2002 with RED DRAGON, a prequel of sorts to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and he had some of the best actors in the world for that film (Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and it was AWFUL. So, how in the world could Ratner be entrusted to head up a huge-budget trilogy's finale? If you have the answer to that, you're smarter than I. Every single moment, with the exception of the Danger Room simulation with the Sentinels, is pretty terrible. What's even worse here is that this film's universe expands even further with the introductions of Angel (the usually great Ben Foster), Kitty Pryde (the usually great Ellen Page), Beast (the still great Kelsey Grammer, in the film's only inspired piece of casting) and Juggernaut (the big Vinnie Jones), and an expanded role for Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) which means that Ratner has even more characters to juggle here. Even worse than that is that they took the single-greatest and most legendary story arc of X-Men history, aka THE DARK PHOENIX SAGA, combined it with possibly the greatest story arc of their recent history, aka CURE, and combined them into one film that has an almost 30-minute SHORTER running time than X2. Basically what we have here is Jean Grey has embraced the immense power that she's apparently held in check for several years and lets it take over her life and it turns her into the most powerful thing out there and of course, she becomes evil with literally no reasoning behind it. At the same time, a brilliant geneticist comes up with a cure to reverse the X-gene in mutants, making them normal humans, and naturally, the son of the man bankrolling this project is also a mutant. Also, Rogue wants to take her relationship to a more ""physical"" level with Bobby, so naturally she considers the cure. A major death near the beginning is so terribly done that it carries no weight on what's to come. It's just that EVERYTHING is bad here. The writing is terrible. The action beats are totally uninteresting. The shortcuts they took for the story are frustratingly awful. The deaths of major characters are given almost no gravity. The characterizations are terrible. It's just all-around unforgivable. This is what spite and pettiness can do to a very well-respected franchise: Put a major black-eye on it. 1/5 Stars.

4. X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE (2009) - One would consider something better would come from David Benioff, one of the co-creators of HBO's fantastic GAME OF THRONES, but no. However, this is not nearly as bad as it should have been. This is essentially playing around a bit with the origin of James Howlett and how he came to become Logan and then Wolverine via the Weapon X Program. In this film, Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed aka Sabretooth (the same Sabretooth that is in the first X-Men film) and is also Logan's brother (by blood or adoptive, I honestly can't remember), and the two of them throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries fight in The Civil War, World Wars I and II, and then onto Vietnam. Logan is more honorable, and Sabretooth is more bloodthirsty. After Logan and his team of misfit mutants (will.i.am as John Wraith, Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, Daniel Henney as Agent Zero and Kevin Durant as Fred Dukes aka Blob) are forced by their commander, the young William Stryker (with relish by Danny Huston), to do something dishonorable, Logan leaves and hides out in Canada with the love of his life Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Sabretooth hunts them down, and Logan, in pursuit of vengeance, goes looking for other mutants, such as the cajun Remy LeBeau aka Gambit (Taylor Kitsch). Crosses and double-crosses occur when the Weapon X Program looks to create a hybrid mutant of sorts that has the abilities of other mutants. Now, Wolverine looks to not only settle some scores, but to be a sort of mutant protector UNTIL... Anyway, by all rights, this shouldn't be a good film; the directing is uninspired, the dialogue is hackneyed and the set pieces don't really impress. But the film manages to still be entertaining enough to hold your interest. Surprise, surprise. But like the Maguffin of the Adamantium bullet, you're likely to forget most of the film as soon as you've finished watching it. 3/5 Stars.
