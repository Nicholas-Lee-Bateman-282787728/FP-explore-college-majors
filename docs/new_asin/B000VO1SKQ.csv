8219543,4,B000VO1SKQ,"I grew up in upstate New York near the barge canal, but knew nothing about it except that the town of Delta was submerged to make Lake Delta, water from which fed the Barge Canal.  This is an interesting video - lots of information.  I enjoyed it.",1438560000,,247,4.23404255319149
8219544,5,B000VO1SKQ,"We were hoping for a mildly interesting video trip along the Black River Canal area with perhaps some general local history. What we received was a fascinating and incredibly well researched work of art and entertainment. We cannot praise the producers enough. There was so much excellent material packed into this documentary, from video, historical photos, maps, letters, diagrams, first person interviews and so on, all frequently put into the context of modern times. This is the best such documentary we've seen on this general topic and wish we could find one done like this for the Erie & Barge Canal systems. The narration was especially noteworthy and very well done. There's no doubt we'll have to watch this again due to the huge volume of detailed information included.",1430870400,,781,5.062015503875969
8219545,5,B000VO1SKQ,"Very informative especially if you live in this area.  Some of the ditch is still present.  Really enjoyed it.
A good history lesson for students who live in this area especially.",1358467200,,179,4.741935483870968
8219546,5,B000VO1SKQ,I purchased this video for my husband.  He works in NY and travels there from our state several times a year.  The locks that we noticed in upstate NY were a mystery. Why were they there? This documentary is a must see for anyone in the area and those interested in history. Relics from the past that had a huge impact on the economics and development of our country will stimulate the interest of many.,1262822400,2,403,4.36
