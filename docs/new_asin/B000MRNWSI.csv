8171567,3,B000MRNWSI,"I got this movie from a Redbox and liked the write up about it.  And I guess the story DID follow the write up, but not nearly as interestingly as it could have.

What everyone else has said is true - truly bad acting, bad sound and props.  I made the comment that someone here made - I think I may have walked away dumber after watching this movie.  At least the filming was decent - unlike the Blair Witch Project where I almost threw up from all the jerking of the camera. I watched this with my 3 kids and it was more comical than anything else to watch this and see how goofy it was.

But also, there was minimal language, though there was some blood and shooting, it wasn't gore like in a lot of movies today.  There was a degree of suspense to see what would happen and if you notice, everyone who has reviewed this, even the one star reviews, stated they watched it to the end. Even my step-daughter, who typically falls asleep during movies watched the whole thing because she wanted to see if it would get any better (it didn't).

The movie is very corny, but maybe there are some lessons one could learn about doing the right thing, actions have consequences etc.  And though we made fun of the goofiness throughout the movie, it certainly did provide us with some clean evening entertainment!",1295481600,2,1304,4.359504132231405
8171568,1,B000MRNWSI,"I don't write a lot of movie reviews because I believe that all movies have some redeeming value, but this movie is truly painful to watch, and I watched the entire movie.  The acting is the most painful.  The timing is poor, the Foley work is non-existent (i.e. sound effects are poor at best).  Unless you're studying film and looking for an example of a really bad movie, don't waste your time or money.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  BTW: George Kennedy does a small cameo appearance (the only convincing acting in the movie). Run don't walk away from this one.",1251417600,2,567,4.519607843137255
8171569,4,B000MRNWSI,"As in any old Western, this movie has plenty of shoot-em-ups.  However, unlike many of the more recent Westerns, it is clear who are the good guys and who the bad guys are and who the really bad guys are.  Therefore, it could be watched by most kids from the age of eight or so, especially when with a parent.  In this movie, one of the medium bad guys even concludes he is on the wrong path and, after paying the price for his robbery, starts a new life as a good guy.  The whole movie revolves around the robber's decision to try to rescue the girl rather than safely escaping with the stolen bank money.  There are several good ethical issues, such as this one, for family discussion to build character.

It is obvious that this is a low-budget movie, with less than stellar actors.  Such qualities are typical of movies intended for children, so I judge the movie as a children's movie and not as an epic Western.  People get killed, so there is typical Western movie violence.  I only noticed a few offensive words, so overall this is a good recent Western for family viewing.  I would say that this movie is certainly as good as the ever popular Roy Rogers movies or the old Gene Autry Westerns.",1226620800,,1201,4.393665158371041
8171570,1,B000MRNWSI,"My husband and I bought this moving at our local Post Exchange here in Germany. We watch alot of movies due to the fact that our TV programming consists of 12 channels from the states with shows that are a season behind in most cases. Our movie kept showing a title with the words ""This presentation is for screening only"". I have never seen that in a movie, but that was probably the only real interesting part of Three Bad Men. What a waste of money and time. I turned to my husband, about 1/4 the way into the movie and said ""Honey.. I do believe this is one of those movies that is going to make us both dumber for having watched it"". We barely made it to the end. The acting was bad, the scenery was okay, the whole movie was disjointed. I also have wondered if we would see present day building on accident due to the ineptness in putting the film / timeline together. Blech.. please, please read the reviews before buying unless you want to see a really terrible movie.",1200182400,,976,4.281081081081081
8171571,1,B000MRNWSI,"90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  The only reason I watched this turd to the end was to satisfy my curiosity that it could not get worse--it did.  Bad acting, bad effects (guns that don't emit smoke when ""fired""), bad dialogue--just bad, bad, bad.  For sure the worst western and most likely the worst movie of any genre I've ever seen.

If you get this movie for free, you still paid way too much.  Avoid this one at all costs.",1183248000,,438,4.228915662650603

8171573,1,B000MRNWSI,"Please, if you are reading this, do not make the same mistake I did.  I read the review here by none whatsoever prior to viewing this mess, but I ignored the review and watched it anyway.  Do not suffer my fate.  Avoid this film at all costs.  This film demonstrates why we need tougher movie camera controls.  I know, I know.  Cameras don't make bad movies, people do, but please.  We must help the incompetent avoid temtation.  Really, I have never ever in any forum including kiddie skits in church with such just down right horrible acting.  My only hope is that the members of this cast got real jobs and are no longer wasting perfectly good film.  Okay, you have been warned.  Heed the warning.  I did not and every time I close my eyes I am regretting that decision.",1181606400,3,773,4.404255319148936
