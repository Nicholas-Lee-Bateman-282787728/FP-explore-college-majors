2850095,2,B000QXDEHC,"I am currently viewing Season 6 of Ballykissangel after having watched the first 5 seasons on DVD over the past few months. Although there were many changes to the cast throughout the 5 seasons, there always seemed to be a central core that kept it glued together. Indeed it was this constant that made BallyK what it was--surely one of the best TV shows on either side of the pond. I really enjoyed spending my evenings with these wonderful folks from a country and culture far from my own. From reading the reviews here I see that the actor who played Brian Quigly passed away shortly after season 5 concluded. I didn't know that as it was never mentioned in Season 6. I thought that like the others who left before him, he merely went on to other pursuits (more money, etc.) The show also failed to note the passing during season 5 of the wonderful Birdy Sweeny who played the farmer Eamonn. I came to love that old geiser. It would have been nice to give him a nod when he passed.
I am so disappointed with the writing and newer characters this season. If it weren't for Liam and Donal I would think it was a different show. Not just that the characters are different, but the writing seems to have lost the spark that made this show special. Even a new, handsome Aussie priest couldn't help it. That's probably why there are only 8 episodes to Season 6. Like an old, sick horse, someone did the humane thing and put it out of it's misery.
I belatedly mourn the passing of Tony Doyle and Birdy Sweeny and the death of a great piece of television history. But I am so grateful I found it and was able to enjoy it's wonderful 5 year run.",1254096000,42,1639,4.342019543973941
2850096,5,B000QXDEHC,"By the sixth or seventh series you realize they are phasing out all of the characters that were so endearing... and yet you find you can't help but liking the new ones just as much.  While some may find it's not how they want to see the clergy portrayed - perhaps it is because they are just so HUMAN - flawed and fantastic all rolled into one.  Isn't that a commentary on all of us?  Fr. MacAnally gives every single curate he has a hard time and is a complete pill - but each of them seems to give kindness back to him in their own way.  Maybe that's a life lesson.  But I will always miss Assumpta ... If you haven't seen BKA from the very beginning, DO IT!  And even Brian Quigley manages to do one last graceful gesture to his village fools, Donnal and Liam.  Again, what a great series.",1234396800,2,792,4.137254901960785
2850097,5,B000QXDEHC,"The character development just gets better and better in the sixth series of Ballykissangel. There are the old favorites such as Liam and Donald plus Kathleen and Father Mack but we are treated to a new, dynamic Australian priest and the exceptionally portrayed life of the Dooly's (new pub managers). Additionally, like a breath of fresh air, a stable manager named Avril appears on the scene bringing with her top notch acting and a rich character perfectly in line with the theme of the series.

You can see where the directors are taking the series and it leaves the viewer equally enthralled as from the days of Asumpta (the original pub owner in series one). I find this rarely happens with a successful series as they tend to become rather silly over time but not so with BallyK. The attention paid to each character's development shows and they never resort to cheap laughs or overly outrageous scenarios.

Sadly, this is the last BallyK series ever to be produced and it still remains somewhat of a mystery as to why the BBC did not choose to continue the show. You really get the sense that they could have continued for several more series before the material became too tired. In fact, seeing the sixth series leaves the viewer desperately wanting a continuation but it is simply not to be.

At least we have the chance to own the entire series now and I'm sure it will bring many years of enjoyment to those wishing to indulge in the that perfect combination of subtle but gripping story line and a level of acting which often has us forgetting that the characters are, in fact, actors.",1215907200,7,1599,4.6431095406360425
2850098,3,B000QXDEHC,"I love this series,but this Series 6 has taken a deeper look into life in Bally K. Some new characters showed up with no explanation of their reason to be in town. One of the things I really liked was being able to follow characters through the series. I am  sorry to see the demise of Ballykissangel,but I will remember it as an intimate  peek into the life of a small Irish town,and it's folks. Wonderful cast members,and totally believable.",1208044800,3,443,4.525
2850099,4,B000QXDEHC,"Thought the writers did a great job dealing with the changes. I was suprised when I came to the end of disc 2 however, that there seemed to be no real ending. It just trails off and leaves you wondering what happens to father mac and other characters.",1197936000,10,251,4.25
2850100,3,B000QXDEHC,"What sort of person are you?  Do you relish variety or prefer the TV shows, musical artists, actresses you like to be recognizably the same over their runs, careers?  The answer to that will determine whether you relish the changes introduced for series six of Ballykissangel, as the following exit the show:  Sean Dillon (Lorcan Cranitch), Emma Dillon (Kate McEnery), Father Aidan O'Connell (Don Wycherley), Orla O'Connell (Victoria Smurfit), Danny Byrne (Colin Farrell), and Brian Quigley (Tony Doyle) who, arguably, was the franchise character and driving force of the entire show.  Mr. Doyle passed away in January of 2000, just after the last episode of the fifth year of BallyK was broadcast (in December of 1999).  There were no more episodes of BallyK until the spring of 2001 at which time series six (the first of 8 episodes) began to be broadcast.  Item one of this final year thus was explaining the absence of  Brian Quigley, dealing with that and then trying to move on without this central character.  Of course, it's still BallyK and a welcoming program to watch, but at one and the same time, not the same anymore without the fulcrum (raison d'tre even), of the whole program.

2850131,1,B000QXDEHC,Ballykiss angel has lost it's luster since Brian Quigley walked in to the sea.  The new characters are not interesting at all.  The bratty kids and the risk taking father do not hold my attention.  It's a good thing that the show will take a walk into the ocean soon.,1427328000,,267,4.3

2850135,5,B000QXDEHC,"One of the best.

2850136,3,B000QXDEHC,It really went downhill in this season.  Too bad too as it was an interesting series.,1424476800,,85,4.3125
2850137,3,B000QXDEHC,I had to buy this due to an error made by Amazon which I didn't catch.  I bought the complete series on Amazon and there were two season 2's and no season 6.,1424476800,,157,3.757575757575758

2850139,4,B000QXDEHC,Only because the season was too short.  Loved the whole series...every season!,1424390400,,78,5.5
2850140,3,B000QXDEHC,"As much as I love the Ballykissangel series, season 6 was not my favorite. Too many character changes, and Paul Dooley can NEVER replace Brian Quigley, no matter how hard they try. Not the same without Niemh, either. A great series, you will enjoy them all, but the first few seasons are the best.",1424390400,,297,4.518518518518518
2850161,3,B000QXDEHC,"In my opinion, not nearly as good as the previous seasons with the original priest. This is still a fun program, and for those in love with Ireland, the scenery, locales, and accents make it more watchable. The Australian eye-candy doesn't hurt, either.",1424390400,,253,4.906976744186046
2850162,5,B000QXDEHC,"It was refreshing to see ""Longmire"" (Robert Taylor - Australian Actor) in a lead role for the season especially since Assumpta (Dervla) was killed off and Tompkinson (currently DCI Banks) was an awful 'substitute' for the punchy, tough, yet likeable Dervla. I actually stopped watching when Dervla left the show and didn't start watching again until Tompkinson was gone. In my opinion, the show would've been better off if they got rid of  Tompkinson and kept Dervla. The addition of Taylor and other good actors gave the series a whole other spin, even keeping the cranky ole Father Mac, didn't turn me away from the show. However, it DID seem to get a little predictable in that almost every epi was an attempt by the character Dooley to con everyone (sound familiar from previous seasons? well that was the whole premise for the previous season's Doyle character of Brian Quigley), but it gave you a peak into the shortcomings of human nature. Previous epi's were just about the groups shenanigans but with Taylor they covered alcoholism, homelessness, fraud, etc... it was presented in an entertaining way that kept me engaged. I liked this season and the addition of Taylor I thought was a great choice. I enjoyed it!",1424390400,3,1222,4.875
2850163,4,B000QXDEHC,"We loved this delightul Irish series.  Every episode was unique and had at least two or three
storylines.  Although there were many changes of characters dropping in and out of the
6 series,  each time a change of main characters occured,  it wasn't difficult to develop a new
relationship with them  as it was so well written.  The characters were always colorful  and often
offbeat, resulting in a very humorous but also touching show.",1424390400,,437,4.824324324324325

2850170,3,B000QXDEHC,"Too many of the original cast are gone so season 6 is not quite as good as those that came before. A bright spot is the introduction of Robert Taylor, the actor who is the star of the current Netflix hit ""Longmire.""",1420588800,,215,4.142857142857143

2850182,5,B000QXDEHC,This is such a sweet BBC series set in Ireland.  Robert Taylor of Longmire fame plays the Australian parish priest serving in Ireland perfectly in Season 6.  You will want to watch these episodes again and again.  Long Live Longmire!,1420416000,,233,4.775
2850183,3,B000QXDEHC,"In this season many of the old characters are no longer part of the episodes.  The Scenery, and the actors are great .  We saw all episodes and would like to see more of them, but there were too many changes to the main plot revolving around the Pub Fitzgerald, and again having a new priest, with a new set of challenges.  We loved the new actors specially the priest and the lady keeping horses.  Again my rating was based on lack of continuity from season 5 to season 6.  The country side of Ireland is gorgeous and makes you want to visit ""Northern Ireland"".",1420329600,,562,4.314285714285714

2850188,4,B000QXDEHC,I enjoy watching because each episode leaves enough to want to come back for more. Some of the characters are a little overplayed but still worth a look.,1419897600,,153,4.5

2850190,4,B000QXDEHC,All new players. Didn't enjoy as much as the other seasons as I loved the cast. Too many new people now. I couldn't quite get a liking for The new pub owners and Liam and Donal's antics are getting old. Not sure how they ever earn a living. Miss Brian. Nonetheless love the scenery and the new Priest.,1419552000,,301,4.206896551724138
2850201,4,B000QXDEHC,"This is a qualified rating.  The initial seasons featuring the story of Father Clifford are excellent and the controversial story is very good and well told, but once the story comes to a logical conclusion, perhaps trying to capitalize on its success, the story goes on with different characters and soon runs out of steam.  So my advice to those contemplating to watch Ballykissangel, the story featuring Fr. Gifford is a MUST watch and worthy of the five-star rating, but the subsequent would be, IMHO, downgraded to perhaps 3-4 stars.",1419465600,,538,4.966666666666667
2850202,4,B000QXDEHC,This season is an improvement over the past 2-3 seasons. Both the story line and staging have been given a good boost. Can it continue?,1419379200,,135,4.44

2850204,5,B000QXDEHC,I have watched all the seasons and was sad that it had ended there. The changes of priests was a nice twist to the show. The only thing that remained constant in the series was the bar and church. Characters changed or grew up. You laugh and cry thru this series. Give it a try.,1418947200,,278,4.072727272727272

I am second generation Irish-American and Ballykissangel allows me to enjoy the humor, wisdom, and culture of the people of Ireland. The characters are well developed, and woven into the more lighthearted Irish humor are more serious elements to touch the human heart.

The series, over all, is 4.5 stars because as the series moves on, the most engaging characters leave.

No sexual scenes, not bad language, and it is about ordinary  people who go thru all kinds of human trials, just like we do. The people in the series are very ""real"" and go thru the same kinds of troubles as we do,  unwanted pregnancy, failed romances, friendship issues, marriage issues, etc.  I'm always sad when I come to the end of a series and this was one of my favorites.. I will watch it again :)",1412812800,,484,4.239130434782608

2850316,5,B000QXDEHC,I love this series. I watch it at night before I sleep. It's uplifting and cheerful and is the perfect antidote for all the crime stuff I watch that can get to be a bit much. This story is set in the small town of Ballykissangel (not a real town). All the characters have funny quirks and there is rarely a dull moment. This is perfect for people who like Masterpiece type theatre only a comedy. I've been watching this series for a long time and thoroughly enjoy it!,1412121600,,467,4.258426966292135

2850322,4,B000QXDEHC,"Season 6 was somewhat of a disappointment. While the writing was still fairly good overall, some of the new characters weren't ever really brought into the overarching storyline, they just popped up. It was kind of disorienting to have all these new characters with absolutely no backstory about ""who"" they were. Also, Oona's husband, the ""bad guy with a heart"" replacement for  Brian Quigly, doesn't seem to have the kind of redeeming qualities of Brian except for his love for his kids. They messed up Frankie's character by having her go all ""by-the-book"" after having her first appear as a warm-hearted practical officer with a keen ability to do the right thing for a small community. While the production values and the acting continued to be first rate, my wife and I just did not care for some of the new characters.",1411689600,,824,4.802816901408451

The one thing that I didn't like, and I know characters come and go, but several of my favorites just disappeared off of the show without knowing what happened, including Fitzgerald.  I did finally figure out she died, but how?  Others like the sheep guy, his nephew, etc.  The second priest, his sister, and the list goes on.  Replacements for the most part were good, but wished they would have let us know what happened.

Can't say the same for season 6...I almost wish they'd tied it all up at the end of 5 and cut their losses. There was a mass exodus of the characters we'd all come to know and love and the replacements weren't worth their salt - new Aussie priest has no redeeming qualities, new guard is hot then cold and so on, cannot stand the obnoxious Dooley children...what a waste of a great show ",1408060800,,506,4.270833333333333

Seasons 4 and 5 were o.k., but the lack of the spark of the ensemble had begun to fade, and it's more pronounced in the last season.",1406505600,,425,4.3924050632911396

We are huge fans of this series. Out only regret is that we didn't discover it until a couple of months ago, almost 18 years after it started. Thanks, Amazon Prime, for bringing this to us.
I meets our Not-A-Soap-Opera Test, since the people (most of them), although human, are doing the best they can to live good lives, love and support each other, and lift each other up. Character development is great, story lines are well done, and most of the characters are likable and believable. If we had any complaint, it's that too many beloved characters are killed off or moved away

Experiencing a failure to engage with any of the characters was a real disappointment.  The new family was very unlikeable, the acting sloppy and the new priest unbelievable.  What happened to Father Aiden?  Liam became very obnoxious and the story behind the disappearance of Brian Quigly was aggravating.

Donal and Liam and Paul Dooley from the public house are still scheming to get rich while head priest Fr Macanally tries to keep things going in his parish.

Its a nice vehicle for Austrailian actor Robert Taylor. You can see a flicker of ""Walt Longmire"", in Robert Taylor's character of Father Vincent Sheehan. The writing keeps you interested in the characters and the actors bring the characters and plots to life. All around good show for the ages.

He was darn good looking, and like all the priests in Ballykissangel, he must have had a history.  Liam and Donal got really old.  Their characters reminded me of the Three Stooges -- bumbling idiots.  Characters left the show -- whether they died in real life or just left -- and were only briefly mentioned as to why they weren't appearing.  The only reason I ""suffered"" through Season 6 was to see if the new priest was going to have a story line.  I can see why it was ""Ballykissangel's"" last season.",1397606400,,607,4.375

2850578,3,B000QXDEHC,It is no wonder this was a short season and the last of the series. The newer characters just didn't measure up to the level set by the originals.

Many characters that we knew and loved were removed from the show and replaced with characters that were neither worth getting to know nor interesting (boring).

2850584,5,B000QXDEHC,"Ballykissangel and Monarch of the Glen have to the be the two best dramatic/comedy series that have ever been made. The 6th and final season of Ballykissangel is still great, although we've lost a lot of characters along the way. the new ones that took their places fit in very well and the series moves along smoothly. We are lucky enough to still have Liam and Donal right up to the last episode getting into shenanigan after hilarious shenanigan. The sad loss of Tony Doyle is probably why the show didn't get a 7th season. His Brian Quigley was such a central character. Paul Dooley and family are at the forefront in the last season. He seems to kind of take over for Brian Quigley who thankfully was not killed off in the show. He runs off to Rio because of financial and legal problems. I'm glad they did it this way. At least we can pretend he's still alive on the show. Niamh comes back for a while in this season, and we have yet another priest. This one from Australia and he doesn't look or act like a priest, but he's a pretty good one, we find out as the season moves along.  The DVD is closed captioned in English for the hearing impaired or deaf such as myself which is a very important detail to mention in any DVD review.",1394323200,4,1239,4.317596566523605

At least Brian Quigley had a few redeeming qualities/humorous moments, but not so with Dooley. Basically, from theme music to shooting to directing the show got really slick this season but kind of lost its center- an attempt to renovate & update that came off as terribly cynical and pretty much killed off what little was left of the show's soul.",1392854400,,477,4.558139534883721

Seasons 1-5 were clever, quirky, endearing, and entertaining.  Sure, Season 6 had its quirky moments, but not enough to patch up the holes left behind by main characters missing, too many new characters appearing out of nowhere, and a storyline that just gives up and ceases to exist.  The Dooley family cannot hold front and center stage.  They became slightly likable in Season 5, but in Season 6 they were annoying.

With that said, it has good qualities.  Louis is awesome.  They should have brought him in sooner and in larger doses (with smaller doses of Dooley).  Father Vincent is a very likable character, but unfortunately he had to interact with the Dooleys quite a bit.  Liam and Donal are still up to the things that Liam and Donal do.

If you enjoyed Seasons 1-5, it's worth watching Season 6 as long as you don't expect it to make a graceful and well-defined exit.",1392076800,,1020,4.574585635359116

Not sure how I was going to react to yet another change in the parish since the priest is the conscience of the entire town but gorgeous Father Vincent proved his meddle right away when confronted by a Dublin TV reporter.  The writers could have taken the low road by creating a storyline of compications of a sexy priest in a small town but by the time Vincent enters the scene, the integrity of the characters has already been well established.

However, the sixth (and last) season, while still entertaining, is not quite up to the standards of the earlier ones.
There are a number of new characters and several previously important ones just disappear with no explanation.
Paul Dooley, in particular, is not a good substitute for Brian Quigley as the village wheeler and dealer.

However, there never seemed to be a 'connection' between the old characters and the new and you got the sense everyone just couldn't wait for this last season to be over.

The new characters are more thinly drawn, less there to love or even maintain our interest.  It is still an entertaining show, but the eagerness with which we anticipated each espisode of the first 4 seasons has disappeared.  Season 5, the second season with the 'new' and quite lovable priest, lacked a bit of the original flare, but still held our interest.  In Season 6, the third priest is paper thin -- very little to love [aside from his looks]. In fact, each of the latest additions to the cast have rather sketchy personal traits that just left us confused.  We will definitely want to rewatch Seasons 1 - 4, and will reconsider Season 5 at that point.  But will definitely not watch Season 6 again.",1384387200,,835,4.563758389261745

However, Season 6 left me feeling a bit down, as there was no proper ending. I think it is because of the next season being canceled, but my goodness...they should've let there be a way to wrap things up before canceling.

The story centers around a new priest from Australia, who's assigned to the small Irish village of ""Ballykissangel"".  It is a rollicking tale about Fr. Vincent and the inhabitants of Ballykissangel.  He has a lot on his plate and a lot to learn.  However due to his calling and the love of God, he grows in love and stature, wisdom and patience.

2850873,5,B000QXDEHC,"The bride and I were hooked on seasons 1-3 of Bally K, but were turned off in seasons 4 and 5 by the focus on Niamh, one of the most excruciating, annoying, and self-absorbed characters in the history of television (with the character of Sean Dillon being a close second--the romance between the two of them was of no interest). We missed the characters of Assumpta and Peter; the newer priest was a bit too gentle to carry on the tradition set by Stephen Tompkinson in his running battles with Niall Tobin's priest, we felt.

  Recently began watching season 6 and, while it's a bit disconcerting that all of these new characters appeared out of nowhere, we both feel that the show gained a new energy with the addition of a priest with some backbone and human qualities and the character of Avril, who carries a wee bit of the spunk shown by Assumpta. The show also seems to have been filmed with higher production values, and there seems to be a return to some of the earlier gentle Irish humor (goodbye, thank God, to Uncle Minto). While Tony Doyle is greatly missed, it seems to us that the producers did a fine job trying to set the stage for a few more years which, we all know, didn't happen.

2850947,3,B000QXDEHC,"IMHO season 6 could have been up to par with the other seasons if they had only given more of a ""back story"" to all the new characters; and closed the open ended story lines of the old characters that ""magically"" disappeared. For example:
1)Where did Avril come from? They never mentioned a racing stables in 5 seasons!
2)Where did the Father Aidan go? To say that he felt like ""he wasn't making a difference, so he left"", is abrupt and at odds with the last episode of season 5...
3)Where did Orla go? They haven't mentioned her yet; are we to assume that because her brother the priest left, she scurried after him? That would be way out of character for her. She was supposed to ""travel the world"" on a whim, yet she had just fixed up a home at the end of season 5! Are we to believe that she said, ""Okay, now that I spent all this time fixing up this charming home, it's off to ________(fill in the blank)!
4)Where did Danny and Emma go? Emma has a new home because her Dad, Sean Dillon, married Niamh and they moved to England, and Danny just started up his new farm. Are we to believe that they, too, just took off to England?
5)Where the heck did old man Eamon go to???
6) and the biggest stinker of all is that Padraig went to rehab half way through season 4. They never mentioned it in season 5, only to have ""Edso"" owning the Gas Station/Car Repair shop in Ballykissangel in season 6... that was one heck of a Rehab!!!
Maybe this was the reason why season 6 was the last season. Too many constraints on the writers, and too many questions of the viewers...
I haven't finished season 6 yet - I'm only half way through, and I still have all these questions running through my mind. Maybe viewers just said ""enough's enough. Yet I'll push through. I haven't watched 5 seasons to quit now!",1374796800,,1795,4.297935103244837

All the great characters left the show except for dumb and dumber.  But unfortunately, they weren't even funny this season.  Can see why the show ended with season 6.

Throwing too many new characters into the mix makes it difficult to get to know them all, especially with little or no background. An absence of respect for actors/characters no longer with the show by just ignoring their disappearance (with the exception of the clever treatment of the loss of Brian Quigley/Tony Doyle) also rankles. Which did they think would attract younger viewers, an Australian surfer priest, or the new opening credits fresh from the cutting room floor of some 1960's American sitcom? Since such changes along with subpar writing and the annoying Dooley tots seemed to permanently sink the series, perhaps it's fortunate the rumored scripts for a seventh series never saw the light of day.

2851067,1,B000QXDEHC,"when I started watching Ballykissange, I fell in love with everyone!  I would watch it straight thru. Spending hours with my headset on.  It was a truly great story.  Loved it from DAY ONE.  Then the owner of the Pub died, the young ""Father"" left.  I even liked Brian and the two slapstick workmen.  They gave me a laugh.  The characters became ""real"".  As the episodes progressed I thought the writers were scratching to get the stories together!

Episodes on Season 5 were not up to Par.  I did not feel a kinship with the NEW Young Priest, and I did not like this ""romance"" kind of thing with him and the 14 year old.  The crush was inappropreiate.

In Season 6, the goat ""DaddyG"" living in the Pub and the relationship with the Horse blew my mind.  I have not finished the season and probably will not.  GOOD BYE TO BKA.",1367020800,,824,4.3355263157894735

I think season 6 showed the same quality as seasons 1 through 3. I thought Robert Taylor was excellent as Father Vincent and I liked seeing more of the Dooley family. I was glad to see Father MacAnally, Brendan, Siobhan, Frankie, Dr. Ryan, Kathleen, Liam and Donal return.  I honestly didn't miss Quigley at all and liked the Dooley family story line better. I enjoyed seasons 1 through 3 with Father Clifford but did not like season 4 or 5 with Father Aidan, his sister and the whole Sean Dillion story line. Season 4 and 5 had way too many new needless new characters. The only episodes I liked from season 4/5 were the ones focused on Siobhan and Brendan.

2851133,4,B000QXDEHC,"I had no plans to watch season 6 after the end of season 5.  I was very tired of the antics of Donnal and Liam which seemed to be more and more of each program.  I also cringed every time Uncle Minto made an appearance.  I knew that many of the characters were just going to disappear without any kind of acknowledgement and felt that the wedding at the end of Season 5 would make good break with the series.

In the end  I'm very happy that I decided to watch season 6 as I enjoyed it very much.  The new curate, Father Vincent is a great character.  Unlike his predecessors , Peter and Aidan, he is not intimidated by Father Mac and won't be bullied by the older priest.  He even stands up to the bishop who is far worse that Father Mac. Father Vincent has his shortcomings, which makes him believable, but he is a good central character for the show.

They did a good job of giving the Brian Quigley character a sendoff, in spite of the death of actor Tony Doyle.  This was an improvement over the way the Eamonn character was quickly written out of the show when actor Birdy Sweeney passed away.

Some new characters, especially Avril, are interesting and add to the series.  On the other had,  Louie,  who speaks with an unintelligible accent, even Brendan can't understand him, is very annoying.

There is no ""final episode"" which happens in many other series.  Former cast members do not make one final appearance nor do  dead characters appear in people's dreams.  The last scene,  which takes place in Fitzgerald's,  was a perfect way to end the series.  It was as if there are more stories to be told.",1273968000,17,1611,4.41156462585034

8198053,4,B000QXDEHC,"The creator of Ballykissangel, Kieran Prenderville, returns to rescue 2001's series 6 of the popular TV drama set in Ireland.

Father Vincent, the new lead, is an interesting character, not least because he is an Australian recovering-alcoholic priest and (I'm told) is good-looking as well (he was played by Robert Taylor). Most of the familiar characters from the earlier series reappear too, such as Brendan, Siobhan, Liam and Donal, and the playful and often moving plots are generally very good. There are also several references to the 'classic' series 1-3, which were absent from series 4-5, showing the Prenderville touch. It's a welcome move as many fans felt that series 4-5 were disjointed from the original three series.

(Note: series 4-5 are dismissed pretty rapidly in the first episode of this series, almost like a bad dream! Several major characters from those series are gone, many without even the slightest mention.)

However, it is sad to report that too much water has passed under the bridge at BallyK. Factors outside of the control of the production team mean there are some huge gaps to fill: Tony Doyle (Quigley) and Birdy Sweeney (Eammon) had both sadly died by this point, and the series feels those losses keenly, if for no other reason than the viewer feels that the BallyK of old is gone. Eammon we could have coped with, but Quigley was integral to the whole show, and somehow it just isn't the same any more. (To be fair, he is given a great - and moving - send off in Episode 1 of this series.)

It is also sadly inevitable that having yet another lead priest character is disorientating. Father Vincent is a likeable character, and very interesting, but being from Australia just seems contrived and fairly daft.

This is by no means a bad series, and if you have enjoyed the other five series then I do recommend this one. It was the last series of the show before it was axed, so any BallyK is always better than none. It is just a shame that the gaps are too big to plug and the programme is starting to get repetitive, even with Kieran Prenderville's input.

Personally, I would have liked a final series (7) which was apparently in pre-production when the axe fell. This was SUCH a great TV show and it deserved a proper send-off in the same manner as Monarch of the Glen, where everyone, including the viewers, knew it was the last series and some old favourites came back to end the story. BallyKissangel was an even worthier cause and was shabbily treated.",1441065600,3,2501,4.698630136986301

I have the set of the 5 seasons and enjoyed all of them most especially the first 3 seasons with Fr. Clifford and Assumpta.  It was a wonderful show with lovely scenery.  I went to Avoca when I visited a friend in Dublin.  The village is wonderful; very picturesque.
