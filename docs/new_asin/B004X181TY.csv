4489998,2,B004X181TY,"Of all the version of Jane Eyre I've seen (five I think) this is my last favorite. They stripped all of the gothic out of this gothic novel. Wasikowska is good as Jane Eyre, but they left out Grace Poole and minimized the thriller aspect of the Madwomen in the Attic. Fassbinder was too young for the role, and his performance was flat. The section with St. John Rivers and Mary and Diana was also given short shrift. I recommend version with Timonthy Dalton/ Zelah Clarke.",1521331200,,473,4.511627906976744

4490000,4,B004X181TY,I did enjoy this film. I feel other Jane Eyre dvds were better than this. Many parts from the storyline were chopped off or removed from this film. I felt many were missing from this film. I also felt this dvd was rushed to shorten it in two hours instead of three hours where other Jane Eyre dvds were shown in 3 hours. I did enjoy this film but certainly not my favorite.,1520467200,,373,4.123287671232877
4490001,5,B004X181TY,"I've read Jane Eyre multiple times and have seen a great many of the film and tv versions, from the Welles 1941 take to the relatively recent Masterpiece Theater mini series. I have to say I found this version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender absolutely sublime - it's both passionate and subtle and holds up extremely well over many viewings. I also feel that the lack of melodrama, along with an elevated aesthetic (cinematography and music), will turn this into a classic that will hold up beautifully over time - it won't appear dated, there's nothing mawkish in its delivery. Wasikowska (a perfect Jane) is a tremendously talented young actress, so brilliant and different in her wide-ranging roles, and Fassbender has the charisma and great skill to provide the perfect pairing with her compelling, enigmatic presence (a passionate blend of strength and vulnerability) in contrast to his fierce pride and wounded soul. Both actors are two of the best currently working in film, and the young director Carey Fukunaga, who later made such a splash with True Detective, reveals that he is a filmmaker of great intelligence and taste, one of the most promising of his generation. I find this film fascinating and it delivers for me emotionally with every viewing - its nuance and authenticity are great strengths, and it respects the intelligence of the audience, something I really appreciate. There are a few films that I find myself returning to, feeling there's more to discover, this wonderful adaptation of Jane Eyre is in that category - it's one of my personal favorites. I love ""Jane Eyre"", the book, as a classic piece of literature, and I love ""Jane Eyre"" (2011), the film, as a beautiful piece of cinema - both are timeless and will continue to thrill and enlighten for generations to come.",1520380800,2,1814,4.931372549019608

4490007,4,B004X181TY,"I saw this a few years ago, before I read the book, and barely remembered it so that will tell you something. Anyway, I finally read Jane Eyre and loved everything about it, so naturally I went looking for a movie adaptation afterwards. Here are my beefs with this version:
- The ending. Seriously lame. It wasn't terrible, but it was lame. You've got a beautiful love story, all the heartache of separation, and then we end with them finally reuniting... and they basically hug, shed a tear or two, and then it's over without explanation of what happened after. I might have yelled, ""WHAT, THAT'S IT???"" when the credits abruptly started rolling. It was really disappointing and felt incomplete.
- Jane's deadpan face. The book makes so much of facial expressions and finding meaning in each others' eyes, and while Jane certainly doesn't give everything away, Rochester not infrequently comments on her little smiles, her mysterious expressions, etc. In the movie version I don't think Jane made more than one facial expression the entire first half, she just kind of stared at everyone and everything. She finally smiled a bit during the proposal scene and some after, but then we went right back to the deadpan. I felt like her character could have had so much more depth. Also, while I know it's tricky in movie form, I wish we could have gotten a better look at her rich inner self-- some of my favorite parts of the book were hearing her inner dialogue and the power she channeled from her sense of self.
- I know it was only two hours and therefore had to be limited, but it's still sad to see things you love missing or shortened.
Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but the book is just so fabulous it's hard not to feel let down.",1519344000,,1739,4.594855305466238

4490011,5,B004X181TY,"If a silent movie of Jane Eyre was made I have not seen it.  To my knowledge, though, I have seen all other English language versions.  This was one of the best of the Jane Eyre movies.  It was enjoyable to watch multiple times.

4490014,5,B004X181TY,The best version ever.  Just wonderfully done!,1516406400,,46,5.571428571428571
4490015,5,B004X181TY,"Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is as beloved as it is well known. Film adaptations of such masterpieces often disappoint either because they try to do too much, attempting to do justice to as many details from the novel as possible and thereby diluting everything, or because they reduce the story into a cheesy romance. This one is an exception, a gem.
Yes, I know: Fassbender is too fair, too young, and frankly too physically delectable to be considered a ""true Rochester,"" a sullen, fiery, dark sort of broken man. And yes, the tone, feel, and visual palettes of the film does not adhere to the gothic style of Bronte's novel.

That being said, folks, a film adaptation can take many angles, and the one this one choose to take is to be one interpretation of the beloved story. Though not an entirely accurate retelling of Bronte's novel, it is a beautiful one, simply for the reason that it's well done and carries the spirit of the novel Jane Eyre at its core. I think of it as akin to a well-done painting of a well-known event, such as the crucifixion of Christ. It's not meant to be accurate. It's meant to be an interpretation: it takes a few core elements of the story and artfully weaves a concise, memorable, and emotionally penetrating narrative around it. The ending, especially, is exquisite.

And can I just say, this film is the only one of the recent screen adaptations (I'm thinking 1996 and 1997, here) in which Blanche Ingram is NOT blonde, but is rather dark-haired and majestic? Thank you to the casting team for finally getting that right.",1516320000,,1568,4.657039711191335

I absolutely love this story and I appreciate that this particular version took a fresh take on the timeline, and that the acting was so subtly brilliant.

4490030,1,B004X181TY,"I was completely disappointed in this movie. If you haven't read the book, you would be completely lost the entire time. If you have, you had to do a lot of ""fill-in-the-blanks"" throughout the entire movie. There was no character development, the scenes were so out of order and did not go into depth enough for it to be understandable, and the acting was so poor that there was no sympathy towards the characters.

4490035,2,B004X181TY,"If you've fallen in love with the book, I would not recommend this movie. The passion between the main characters in the movie is lackluster in comparison to the written work. It follows the book decently, but the changes they do make really alter the emotions within the story. The character development is greatly lacking as well, which is a key component to the book. If you like moody, gothic films with little dialogue, this might be a good movie for you, but if you enjoy passionate love stories and excellent character and plot development, I recommend you pick another film to watch!",1504137600,,591,4.747572815533981

4490066,4,B004X181TY,"I actually saw this one a few years ago but recently re-watched it. People may remember Mia Wasikowska as Alice from Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, but she's actually a pretty great actress. Michael Fassbender is of course an incredible actor, and much appreciated that he plays his role with nuance, instead of just being menacing. He gives his lines plenty of power but also delicate emotion which makes it very easy to accept the relationship that grows between the two romantic leads.

The other actors are also good but the cinematography, music, and Jane and Mr. Rochester portrayals are what the film hangs upon, and they carry the film. I wish the cinematography was a bit more dynamic (ala Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice, or a Terrence Malick film), and purists may detest how much this film diverges from the book, but you can always watch other versions if you want the story with less interpretation.

I personally enjoy the outdoor vistas, the heartstring-pulling romance. Yes, that great line from the book is in this version, and I can't imagine it said, acted, or felt any better than Fassbender does it here (he is treating the source material with a lot of respect in his performance). Recommended for those looking for a fresh take on the story. If you want a ""classic"" film I recommend the Orson Welles version.",1496016000,,1336,4.804347826086956

4490072,5,B004X181TY,A good version of this work.,1491091200,,28,3.8333333333333335
4490073,4,B004X181TY,"This is a decent enough rendering of Jane Eyre. Michael Fassbender has a nice sparkle in his eyes that alludes to the humor with which Rochester tempers his gruffness, and which is the honey that draws Jane in. Mia Wasikowska is a sturdy Jane, not too grave, willing to stand up to him, though still aware of her place and her need for the job. Unfortunately, since this is a two-hour long adaptation, the scenes between the two are cut short, so their intense attraction for each other based on one or two quick banter sessions is a bit bewildering. It's especially unbelievable how he would fall for Jane given that she's not allowed all of the head musings that Charlotte Bronte gave Jane, and all of her sharp retorts.

Sumptuous cinematography and I loved Thornfield, it really came alive here. I still like the Timothy Dalton version better, it's a bit lighter, and people tend to forget that there's quite a bit of lightness in their relationship, despite all of its melodrama. The problem with any adaptation of Jane Eyre is, of course, that it's not the book. Without getting into Jane's head, which the book does so explosively well, there's just no comparison. Get. The.

4490088,5,B004X181TY,"I'm really shocked by so many negative reviews. I read them and wonder if we're the same species. I've seen all the JE renditions, read the book over and over, and, simply put, this filming is miles ahead. It just swims in the Dark Romantic vibe. Mia W is an untouchable JE. Yes, the script is different from the book, but, for example, I don't think you could expect a director of a two-hour film to portray the book's St. John Rivers, what with all his complexity: his cold, impersonal Christianity and mind games against Jane. Jamie Bell's St. John was a fabulous substitute. In short, this is a perfect film -- even with the bits of modernism that CB might not have recognized. What all the other films miss -- badly -- is how Dark Romantic CB made JE. But then a film cannot start reading the sublime passages -- without seeming gimmicky -- rather, it has to *show* what CB wrote. And yes, it succeeds wonderfully. Let me praise highly the luxurious soundtrack as well.",1489881600,5,974,4.508474576271187

4490113,2,B004X181TY,"I've read Jane Eyre four times, have taught it twice, and watched six Jane Eyre films - most several times. This one, in my opinion, is one of the two worst. I saw it originally on the big screen and was very disappointed with it - it left me cold because there was no chemistry whatsoever between the characters, no convincingly playful interchange, no real development of their relationship, and very little expression on the part of either Rochester or Jane to reveal their emotional struggles. Michael Fassbender also makes a very poor Byronic hero and doesn't have the right personality at all for Rochester.

In regard to the plot - the out-of-order chronology was bothersome, Granted, given it's a two hour film, some scenes that are in the book will be omitted - but what is omitted here are scenes that show the development of feeling and connection between the characters and engage the viewer....as well as a few key episodes like the gypsy episode. And certainly an unnecessary plot change occurred in the Rivers episode and even in Rochester's behavior at the end of the film.

Given the good reviews the film has received, I thought I'd give it a second chance and watch it on dvd. What a disappointment. It is even worse than I had remembered. I actually kept cringeing watching it, remembering how well some of the scenes are portrayed in some of the other Jane Eyre films, and how flat they are in this one.

My favorite version of Jane Eyre by far is the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens one - one of the greatest Masterpiece theater shows of all time. Absolutely perfect chemistry between the two characters. Other favorites - the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark and Orson Welles versions although all of those have one or more plot problems.  But at least the main characters are well-cast and their is real chemistry between of them. At the bottom of my rating scale are this version and the Susannah York version, and I place the William Hurt version only a step above those because he is so miscast as Rochester.

Do yourself a favor and watch the version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens (Maggie Smith's son). And read the book. It's superb.",1485734400,,2185,4.739473684210527

4490136,5,B004X181TY,"I love the story of Jane Eyre having read the book several times and seen various versions whenever they come out. My favourite Jane Eyre still remains the mini-series with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke because it is a mini-series and able to do the book and the full story more justice. I did really love Timothy Dalton as the tormented Rochester and Clarke as the demure yet spirited Jane.  I do tend to judge Other Jane Eyre production against it.  This was very, very good. It conveyed the essence and feel of the story wonderfully well considering the two hour length, far better than the other movie versions ever managed.

Michael Fassbender was captivating as Rochester, gruff and still empathetic and heart-rending in his pain. Mia was very good as the self-denying Jane. I could feel her inner turmoil beneath the placid exterior. When they are parting after the wedding you could feel the internal strain of both souls being ripped apart. Judi Dench was a warmth and loving Mrs. Fairfax. I loved the way the setting and the way it was filmed suggested Gothic darkness and mystery without overplaying this theme.  I really enjoyed that aspect of the film.  My only real complaints are that portions of the story are not tended to but that is owing the fact that it is a film and therefore pressed for time. What is showed and told is very well done. Overall I loved it.  Nicely adapted. Heart-rending and enjoyable.",1484611200,17,1427,4.710843373493976

4490181,5,B004X181TY,"A romance classic, this film lived up to expectations.  The costumes and set design ensured the viewer's experience of period piece felt authentic.

The actors portrayal of their characters was an accurate portrayal of Bronte's classic novel - although I found some of the dialogue unrealistic.  Did people really talk that way?  I doubt it - though Bronte may have intentionally offered her readers an alternative perspective.  She certainly was ahead of her time offering readers a perspective of equality in their relationship - certainly this was not the norm. But in this regard, Bronte's vision was a precursor to feminism.

Sometimes, it was a strain when Jane failed to catch on to Rochester's declarations of love - though to be fair, he was somewhat convoluted.  This may have been intentional on Bronte's part.  But perhaps Fassbender's Rochester could have been more direct.

It was hard to regard Fassbender as plain - though costume probably made a valiant (failed but valiant) effort.

Unlike many other renditions of this novel, this one was somewhat muted.  The unbelievable harsh conditions of the time were not so evident.  The scenes of the countryside were very beautiful - and these could have been very starkly contrasted to the abysmal conditions of life that people of that time had to endure.",1473120000,,1318,5.050925925925926
4490182,4,B004X181TY,"I have mixed feelings about this adaptation of Jane Eyre. I have not seen every movie adaptation, but I have seen a couple and have read the book and am a great fan of the book.
Good points:
- The casting was excellent in this version. However I felt like the actor they chose for Mr. Rochester was a bit too handsome to fit the character from the book. His character was described as rugged and athletic, but not handsome. To be fair, maybe our perception of handsome is different from what it was back in that day.
- The acting was very good imo. Very convincing.
- I like that the script included much of the very wording from the book.
Bad Points:
- The fact is, you just can't fit a story like Jane Eyre into two hours. There is just too much of importance that plays into the plot that I don't think you can justifiably leave out. The love story felt rushed and I felt this cheapened the realness of their relationship. It made it seem like they fell in love after a few encounters over the course of a couple days. It didn't happen like that. Even so, they focused on the love story the most, but Jane Eyre isn't just a love story. It's her life story. Which is just as important. I know they tried to give fair due to the other parts, but it just fell short. The ending scene I feel was disappointing as well. It ends so abruptly, that you almost feel like there was some sort of technical error and a scene was just chopped off.
Aside from the time constraints that left much of the story out, I think they did as good of a job as they could have given the allowed amount of time. My personal favorite adaption so far though, is the newest Masterpiece Theater version. It's considerably longer and so allows more of the story to be told.",1472601600,,1746,4.230538922155689

I couldn't handle the '70's or earlier ones).  Mia is delightfully eloquent in both her ""public"" and ""private"" moments and needs no narration to reveal the inner workings of Eyre's mind.  Fassbender is dark and perfectly suited, despite his incredible handsomeness, to the dark Rochester role.  He made my heart flutter.

Four 2 hr sequels would barely capture the book  That said, this is the Absolute Best portrayal of Jane Eyre that I have seen and I have seen them all (and read the book over 10 times - yeah - it's a favorite). It was dark and yet beautiful, like the book. Mia Wasikowska's portrayal of Miss Eyre was as close to perfect as one can come - but still she added her own unique touch to the personality. Michael Fassbender's only fault was that he is good looking. His torment and treatment of others was spot-on. Dame Judi Dench's Mrs. Fairfax was impeccable. Again, my complaint is the 2 hr limit - one can only covey a shadow of a work like Jane Eyre in such a short time frame - and this movie succeeded in conveying an artistic, realistic and moving shadow of the novel. I watched it twice. The individual that wrote the Amazon synopsis: ""A mousy governess who softens the heart of her employer soon discovers that he's hiding a terrible secret"" is an embarrassment and should find another line of work.",1464048000,,1047,4.341836734693878

4490238,5,B004X181TY,"This movie was a surprise. I was impressed. This is the one theatrical version where I enjoyed both Jane AND Rochester equally with Mia and Michaels stellar performances. The other characters are amazingly good as well. Especially Judy Dench, Jamie Bell. And FINALLY, Jane looked the right age. Mia gives us an innocent, yet feisty Jane. Michael is a great mixture of torment and tenderness. The interview scenes, the proposal, after fire & after marriage scenes are wonderfully executed. They are especially good where he begs her to live with him. You feel so sorry for the characters here. Also, I liked where she imagines him at the door, in the snow, because you always miss Rochester during the Rivers scenes.

The format is miles apart from other adaptations, but it is a welcomed change. It begins with Jane leaving Thornfield.  All JE fans, the target audience, will recognize that immediately. The Rivers are introduced early on. How great to see attention given to this important passage in the novel!  In the time constraints of a movie as opposed to a ministry, that was impressive. Jane flash-backing from here to childhood, then Rochester was a wonderful choice because few key parts of the story are missing.  What a great screenplay! To think I wasn't going to watch this because in the previews Rochester looked like a vampire with those spooky, fully black eyes. (Missing thankfully from the movie!)

However I did not like Carys choice to end the movie so abruptly. Editing the long walking scenes would have given time for a proper ending. WHY do all the adaptations fail to go beyond this reunion? Id love to see them marry, have a kid  like in the book.  When did happy marriage become non cinematic? Id love to see an ending when Rochester regains his sight and sees Janes light blue dress and glittering necklace. That would have been a happier ending than Rochester looking a hot mess in the final scene and with these two characters, who have come to love each other through wonderful conversation though the whole story, say so little. In spite of the abrupt ending, I enjoyed the rest of the screenplay and Carys vision. Well done, all!",1463097600,,2165,4.7882037533512065
4490239,5,B004X181TY,"Three of the many film versions of Jane Eyre are my favorites: George C. Scott/Susannah York; William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg and Michael Fassbender/Mia Wasikowska. The first, seen many years ago, I admired for the spirited performance by Ms. York, especially given the style of acting then prevalent. That film is my sentimental favorite. All three are cinematically beautiful. That countryside, that wonderful house!

Setting aside scenes of Jane's early life and the months of her escape to the moors, I want to compare the second two films. One screenplay truly enriches the other in revealing why Rochester is a tormented and very nearly hopeless man and why meeting Jane strikes him with such force. Rochester has been ""running as fast as he can"" all his life, living up to family expectations, a family that has used him, the younger son, heartlessly, with no regard at all for his well-being. He has honored all obligations and as a result leads a desperate life at home or away. (The Hurt/Gainsbourg screenplay is the most enlightening here.) Hurt and Fassbender both portray him beautifully. I better understood Fassbender's sigh in the final scene after seeing Hurt's Rochester.

Both Gainsbourg and Wasikowski portray Jane movingly. I admire them both.

Jane has had a truly crappy life, as we all know, but it somehow didn't kill her spirit and  she has HOPE for a bigger, better life. During her first encounters with Rochester we see the two RECOGNIZE the spirit in each other. Rochester dismisses her in the evening, so discomfited is he that here is a person who can see him, unlike his servants and society friends. (The look on Judi Dench's Mrs Fairfax when the talk turns to imps and ""little green men"" is priceless.) The next day, Rochester bangs around the house and grounds trying to deal with his emotions. Or drinks too much. Can he dare hope?

Jane has her own emotions to deal with: her hope is kindled along with desire. Watch Gainsbourg's tiny frisson when Rochester takes her hand after dealing with Grace Poole after the fire in his bedroom.

Compare Dench (touching) and Plowright's (precious) Mrs. Fairfax. How they try to deflect Jane from thoughts of Rochester as other than an employer.

Fortune-telling scene unnecessary. Rochester torments Jane enough to elicit her feelings for him without it.
My limited knowledge about film-making limits me to referring only to the actors instead of crediting directors and writers.

4490252,2,B004X181TY,"I finally finished watching this movie on my second try. The first time, I was so disappointed that I just turned it off. Now, a few years later, I decided that maybe I was being a snob before and give it an honest try.  I was still terribly disappointed and I so shocked to see that it had as many positive reviews! I assumed that most of them derived from people who enjoy period pieces but haven't actually read the book. However, it seems that other avid JE fans love this adaption despite how far it strays from the book. (I guess I'm just more of a purist.) Why change or add to a  story so well written in the first place?

I believe this movie SHOULD have been amazing given it's incredible cast but after reading the IMDB info on the making of the film, it seems the director took various liberties with the story to make it prettier and ended up lessening their love as well as the ultimate theme of redemption Bronte intended for her story. I didn't mind how they arranged the timeline. I could appreciate that being their unique stamp on the JE story but they spent more time on that than developing the relationship between Jane and Edward. It sort of surprised me that he liked her and visa versa. They also made you believe that Jane just sort of adopted the Rivers because of their kindness and because she wanted family but they were actually related by the Uncle in Madeira! It changes the dynamics of St. Johns and Jane's relationship. It's as if the movie makers were thinking, ""oh dear, we can't have them talk of marriage when they're cousins! What would people think?!"" Hello! Let's stay with the times. That was not at all frowned upon back then. I think the viewers could handle it.

If you love the book, just watch the 2006 BBC adaption.",1459123200,11,1764,4.418461538461538
4490253,3,B004X181TY,"Along with the Tenant of wildfell Hall, Jane Eyre is my favourite Bronte book.  I wasn't aware of this 2011 version and was interested to see how it compared to an earlier adaptation with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. I never understand why filmmakers feel the need to chop and change stories around, we all know the story of Jane Eyre (and if you don't you should read the book because it's a brilliant book). The film starts with Jane leaving Thornfield Hall and arriving at the house of St John and his sister's, it then flashes back to her time at her aunt Reed's house and then to Lowood School and then to her arrival at Thornfield Hall. Easy enough to follow but unnecessary.

The acting is good and we hear some faithful Yorkshire accents, with the exception of Judi Dench who seems to forget and changes from upper class English to Yorkshire to South Shields and back again.

I enjoyed the film, but not as much as other versions and thought it  was a bit pointless to make yet another. I suppose the BBC have too much of our TV licence money - we all pay 160 a year - and they just don't know what to do with it all.",1459036800,2,1130,4.291079812206573

4490260,2,B004X181TY,"While I thought this movie was a beautifully shot, attractive film I do not think it was an accurate portrayal of the novel. Bronte's gothic book was less flowery and dramatic than the movie showed. The movie felt made to admire or idolize, not for people to relate to in the way Bronte's novel connected with readers. Mia Wasikowska made an overly attractive Jane Eyre, who is described as a generally plain, rather ugly character. The same goes for Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester; he made sideburns and angst look good, no small feat. From the opening scene, I thought the movie was something Bronte would have disapproved of. Told in a series of flashbacks, the story is woven with Jane telling St. John her past, as in her childhood, and then cut to the point where she arrives at the Moor House. Once Jane has told her story up to where the film keeps referencing back to, the story goes chronologically. I found the ending to be overly abrupt and sudden in a way the novel wasn't. In addition, screen time for Helen Burns, Bertha, Bessie, Thornsfield, and Jane's cousins at Moor House felt very badly developed and rushed. If I hadn't read the novel already, I would have been very confused. The director (Cary Fukunaga) even cut out characters who influenced Jane, such as Bessie and Mrs. Temple. Overall, I would not recommend this.",1457827200,2,1345,4.703389830508475

Maybe you'll be super pleased with it if you haven't read the book, but to me it seemed way too condensed, bare-bones, leaving out some key stuff.

There was a lot of holes and gaps in the movie, but I get there can only be so much that can be put in a two hour movie. Having Mia as Jane eyre was probably not the best decision. I felt her performance wanting. Fassbender did an amazing job I thought he was a great Rochester but the chemistry between the two main characters was lacking. I felt really no emotional move from this movie maybe if they chose another Jane. The best version to check out is probably the 2006 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.",1456963200,2,611,4.186440677966102
4490265,4,B004X181TY,"I prefer the BBC version with Toby Stephen and Ruth Wilson but the more I watch this big screen film version, and the more I like it!!!
What I love in this movie is the atmosphere created by the superb music, the shots of the dry, barren landscapes, and the use of the light and darkness!!! This movie is very dark and the atmophere rather gloomy! It shows a completely different aspect of the novel from the BBC version, and that's why I like this movie so much!!!
I really enjoyed seeing another Jane Eyre: this one seldom smiles (does she even smile once?) , she's so reserved and cold, therefore it's kind hard to really like this one but at the same time, I like her strong will and I think the movie seems to focuse on her desire for independence!! So it's very interesting to see this other Jane Eyre!
I don't want to talk much about the love story. There's too much restreint, I didn't feel the passion between Rochester and Jane Eyre in this version, simply because there were too few scenes between them. Worse, I have the impression that this Rochester is a bit overshadowed by St John Rivers. And it seems to me that the focus of the movie is on Jane Eyre, alone! and this aspect is rather well done!!!

4490277,5,B004X181TY,"I have dreamed of Rochester ever since the first time I read Jane Eyre. I was 10 years old. From then on, I read the book at least 5 times and watched different adaptations. Every single one of them on this earth. Then finally....... Michael Fassbender is THE Rochester of my dream.  Yes, he is too handsome as Rochester but how can I complain? Observe him when Rochester begs Jane to stay, asking "" You would rather drive me to madness than break some mere human law."" and sobbing ""Listen to me. Listen. I could bend you with my finger and my thumb. A mere reed you feel in my hands. But whatever I do with this cage, I cannot get at you, and it is your soul that I want. Why can't you come of your own free will?"" Laugh at me all you want but I cry every time I watch his performance at this scene.
 I watched this movie many times. At first it was Mia as Jane that stole the show. Then Rochester came to life. Every time I watch this movie, Mia dimmed away and Michael shinned brighter. Jane in my head would be heartbroken than angry, resolved and sad to leave Rochester than insulted and angry like in the movie. Jane would be resigned yet heartbroken into pieces barely breathing, barely talking, not upset and shouting. I don't think Jane would ever look at Rochester they way Mia looked at him.
 However, Rochester was more and more becoming of the one in my head. Sympathetic, disappointed, broken but yet yielding, fundamentally kind and being cynical about his own kindness... it was all there. A free soul caged in profound misfortune that he cannot escape, devoid of true happiness forever.... yet who cannot let go of hope, a hopeless romantic who believes in unearthly love, it was all there in Michael Fassbender. Reading this review you wouldn't believe that I didn't know who Michael Fassbender was. Unbelievable, how could I not? Yet, it was true. I didn't know and I didn't care at first. It was from Poirot's After the funeral where he stole my focus very recently.
 So I applaud his performance and recommend to anyone to see his superb interpretation of Rochester. The other part of the adaptation are not bad either. In fact, this is the best one out there for me.",1451692800,2,2188,4.4625

4490295,3,B004X181TY,"This video was very pretty: the cast, the scenery, the filming style -- but it dropped the ball as far as telling the story of Jane Eyre. A few scenes were well done, such as the raillery between Rochester and Jane as they talked the first time in the library, but too many rich details were omitted to really get the texture of the characters and the plot across. The actor who played Rochester in particular was nothing like the character in appearance and came across more like an unevenly behaving brat than the troubled and complex soul depicted in the book. While Mia Wasikowska visually made a fairly good Jane, she depicted her as a trembling little violet and did not show the core of steel exemplified Jane in the book. I was also annoyed at how this film de-emphasized the role of religious belief in Jane's life. I imagine this was done in hopes of appealing to a more mainstream contemporary audience, but the religious themes are quite key to the story and the film was weakened without them.",1445040000,2,1006,4.56353591160221

He is quite powerful in his performance, magnetic, and passionate, and you can feel it simmering inside him. I absolutely adore Mia and to me she as well truly embodies Jane's character, stoic, strong, but equally passionate though in a different manner than that of Rochester. Jamie Bell was a great choice for St. John, he has excellent facial features to embody St. John's outer marbleness, with a fiery fervor hidden deep inside.

I didn't. The original novel is drenched in red, flames, religious fervor, hysterics, and a simmering sexual tension, with a hint of the paranormal. This movie was not drenched in anything. It quietly told a boring story of a governess who was two-timed. Nobody really emoted. Jane twitched her eyebrow every so often. Rochester's lip trembled. St. John raised his voice. Bertha spat on Jane (trust me, one of the most exciting things that happened).

And then, after dragging us through two hours of more boring than watching paint dry, they wrap the end in approximately 30 seconds of screen time. What took Charlotte Bronte 3 chapters to cover got 10 seconds. Seriously?

Can I have my two hours back, please?",1432944000,3,873,4.730263157894737

4490341,4,B004X181TY,"Cary Fukunaga 2011 film adaptation of Jane Eyre captures Charlotte Bront classic Gothic Romance novel with spectacular visuals and intense acting. Although many parts of the novel are left out of the film, you are still given a true sense of the themes Bront illustrated in her novel. Fukunaga uses captivating backgrounds and superb acting from his cast in the film to tell the story of Jane Eyre. Fukunaga builds on visual cues from the story with Gothic Architecture and beautiful scenes of nature. The mood of the story is emphasized with the powerful emotion from the characters and the use of weather and nature to capture add depth to the film. The eeriness of the story and supernatural themes of the Gothic Romance genre are exquisitely shown in the film.
The plot of the film is shot in a flash back style that shows Janes tumultuous childhood and her rise at Thornfield, as Governess. The film is balanced with passion and dark human emotion in this Gothic tale. You don't have to be a fan of Gothic Romances to appreciate the quality and effort that went into presenting the key points from the book to the big screen.
Mia Wasikowska shines in the leading role as Jane Eyre. Wasikowska illuminates Janes strong will and captures Janes struggle for acceptance while falling in love. Michael Fassbender brings to life the often tormented and surly Edward Rochester. Fassbenders portrayal of Rochester captures the dark nature of the character, along with his love and respect for Jane. Not to be lost in Wasikowska and Fassbender efforts is Judie Dench. Her mother-like portrayal of the housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax is perfectly suited for her.
I was pleasantly surprised with the film and would recommend it. The acting along, with exquisite directing, made the film a timeless piece just like the novel. The classic tale of love and woe is often lost in modern films and storytelling today, but Jane Eyre shows theses types of stories are still relevant.  Fukunagas re-imagination of Jane Eyre gives a new audience a different platform for the classic novel to be viewed.",1431475200,,2080,4.8923512747875355

4490357,2,B004X181TY,"For Jane Eyre fans this movie will be a disappointment.  I won't watch it again and nearly didn't bother to finish it.  I will admit that it is difficult to imagine being able to fit such a lengthy and involved story into a 2 hr film and perhaps they did the best they could, but the result is lacking.  For those who are familiar with the story you will find a noticeable lack of character development, even on the part of Jane's character due to how little they develop her relationships and responses to ""side characters"", some of which are left out completely in this rendering.  The entire story should flow and center around how Jane perceives and responds to her world and it's hard to portray her perceptions when she's not permitted to fully observe or interact with all the characters in the original story.  I found the story ""dry"" merely working it's way through the main events to a disappointing conclusion.  So much of the dialog is missing between Jane and Mr. Rochester and as a result even their relationship seems somewhat ""dry"" in it's portrayal.

Those who remember the disappointment of ""Pride and Prejudice"" fans over the most recent shortened version of that story(2005) will find this truncated version of Jane Eyre to be even worse.  The 2005 ""Pride and Prejudice"" was acceptable even if not as delightful as the BBC version, but this version of Jane Eyre is not worth your time.",1426377600,,1405,4.682926829268292

4490360,2,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre is my favorite book, and I have seen four of the film adaptations, including this one. This one, while the filming is beautiful and picturesque, is severely lacking. It does not capture the passion between Jane and Rochester, or Jane's deep faith in God, both of which are key to the whole story. It was Jane's deep faith in God that gave her the moral willpower to leave Rochester and to believe that she could survive without him. And, I don't understand why Fassbender and Wasikowska played Rochester and Jane so sedately. They both have passionate hearts, and a dry witty sense of humor I might add, but this is barely glanced at in the movie. Wasikowska, especially, plays Jane as too mousy. Jane was, though quiet, a sharp, intelligent, strong woman, and the book highlights her intellect. There is something wrong when St. John, who is supposed to be as cold as stone, is more passionate than Rochester. Also, before Rochester's proposal, there is a cat and mouse game he plays with Jane, which is important in building a tension between them. It has Jane guessing at who the object of Rochester's affections is. However, this is sadly left out of the movie as well. Lastly, the ending is much too short and ends too abruptly. It leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied, especially for those of us who have read the book. If you want to watch excellent adaptations of the book, watch either the 1997 movie version starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds or the 2006 BBC miniseries with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens.",1425168000,3,1533,4.723880597014926

If you haven't read it, do so immediately. It would be absurd to judge a film based upon how well it adheres to Charlotte Bront's incomparable psychological depth, historical portraiture, and gorgeous prose. It is, alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486406512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tale of Two Cities (Dover Thrift Editions)</a>&nbsp;by Charles Dickens, *the* novel of revolutionary subject-hood. But unlike Dickens' more topical subject matter, the moral and erotic core of Bront's vision has only become more urgent with the passage of time.

That said, Fukunaga updates the ""Jane Eyre film"" (nearly a genre unto itself) with commendable accuracy and singularity of vision. While this compact rendition could easily have tolerated an hour longer in order to draw out the characters' moral intelligence, the scenes that Fukunaga does choose to depict capture the gothic nature of a social world that, even in Bront's time, had already begun to seem alien to the current of popular life. Rochester is no Mr. Darcy, and some film versions have a tendency to flatten the radical challenge that an erstwhile bigamist and feminist mystic would have posed to the mores of British gentry; they fail to capture the ironic bite of that ""friendship"" between them. Not so here; the sweeping naturalism of the cinematography elegantly translates the gothic impressionism through which the novel contains the raw powers of erotic, intellectual, and social liberation.

It is stingy and formulaic to fault the film for including so little of the novel's ""character development,"" as some reviewers have done, because Jane's character undergoes about as little change over the course of the novel as does Christ from one end of the gospels to the other. Indeed, it is precisely her fixity of character that transforms her into a messianic figure whose conscience stands even above the word of God, the fires of her will melting the world into the form of her moral reason. This film isn't a perfect adaptation, but I would rather have two minutes of Mia Wasikowska's explosive ferocity than fifty-eight minutes of bloodless romance.",1423353600,6,2451,5.862745098039215

Mia Wasikowska pretty much stumbles through this one looking like a constipated zombie - constantly a grouchy expression, and absolutely no emotional connection to anyone or anything. She got the reserve part down, but not Jane's inner affection or loyalty. I found the overall story terribly truncated, although I'm not sure if that can be blamed on the director or the screenwriters. And the ending is so terribly abrupt, and uses almost no text from the book at all. Overall, the film had a very pretty, dream-like look to it, lots of mist and pastoral scenes and subtle music, and the costuming seems accurate and pretty. For aesthetic reasons, and the barely used but very adept Mr. Fassbender, I give this 3 stars.

4490384,1,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre is one of my favorite classic love stories. I have seen about four versions and this was the worst version ever. I checked this out because I like Michael Fessbender, but this version was horrible. The acting wasn't bad, though I got tired of the girl who played Jane staring off into space every minutes, but beyond that the acting was fine. The writing and movie was just so boring and there was NO romance and Michael and the girl who played Jane had no chemistry. Also, it's hard to see how he would be so taken with her because she was plain as can be and offered nothing stimulating that would warrant such interest from a man like Rodchester. No disrespect for this actress, but I think she wasn't right for the role. She lacked the charm of previous actresses who have played the part.

The movie was incredibly boring and I dozed off on it three times. The film had to be on more than an hour before we knew Jane and Rodchester had feelings for each other then all of a sudden they are so in love? There were also different things in this version that weren't in other versions, such as Rodchester's wife. I don't remember his wife in other versions, but this was just bad all around and very disappointing. I expected a beautiful, classic romantic film and I got none of that. All I got was a bunch of scenes with Judi Dench and Jane Eyre. Those two had more scenes than Jane and Rodchester! It's like the film lost all focus, and I can't see why there wasn't more romance. I had high hopes because the trailer looked good but this is horrible.

4490399,5,B004X181TY,"This adaptation is beautifully done, with only slight departures from the book. Michael Fassbender makes a very convincing Rochester and Mia Wasilkowska is a superb Jane Eyre. Judi Dench is also very well cast as Mrs. Fairfax. I do wish they picked a better Mr. Rivers, but otherwise the casting is faultless. This is my favorite version, followed very closely by the 1986 adaptation with Timothy Dalton as the lead. The cinematography and scenery in this version are truly beautiful, and the score underlines the quality and class of this adaptation. Highly recommended.

The only recommendation I would have is for those who have not read the book: this version relies a lot on the acting without words, and the internal monologue/explanations of certain actions that the protagonists have in the novel is absent here. If you have not read the book, this could be difficult to follow, so this adaptation may not be fully appreciated - save it until after you read the book (which is a timeless classic and worth a read).",1417910400,4,1022,4.873563218390805

4490433,5,B004X181TY,"As someone who is an avid period-drama film viewer, I can personally attest that Jane Eyre (2011) is an intense and thought provoking love story. It questions the notions of love and duty as well as the prejudice that we have for people that we don't truly know.

While the movie is based on the 1847 Charlotte Bronte novel of the same name, director Cary Fukunaga brings a fresh and beautiful adaptation with two great actors in the spotlight. First we have Australian born Mia Wasikowska, whose slight, plain appearance is practically Jane incarnate. Wasikowska has proven herself to be quite choosy with her roles, opting often to play strange, multilayered characters. In Stoker (2013) she played India Stoker, a young woman infatuated with her uncle. In The Kids Are Alright (2010) she plays Jules, a headstrong girl that is the child of an anonymous sperm donor. In Jane Eyre, Wasikowskas role is equal parts plain (which is quite a feat considering how beautiful she is) and strong-willed.
Mr. Rochester, the popular male literary character, is played by Michael Fassbender. Im biased, but I think that Fassbender is one of, if not the best, actor in Hollywood today. I have a thing for him. In this case, Fassbenders brooding passion works in bringing Mr. Rochester to the screen.

The basic premise of the movie tells the story of Jane Eyre, a strong girl who is orphaned at a young age, surrounded by a sea of unloving relatives. She is soon sent to a finishing school where she is beaten until she learns to comply with the greedy owners of the Lowood School. Jane eventually becomes a teacher and gets a job to be the governess of a small child at the Rochester Estate. It is there that she meets the strange and cold Mr. Rochester, whom Jane falls in love with. After a while it is revealed that Mr. Rochester loves her as wellbut he already has a Mrs. Rochester. Whoops.
What is so great about this movie is that the plot and the mise-en-scene have elements of light and dark. The lighting and color saturation is beautiful, especially in the scene where Rochester proposes to Jane. It is obviously set in an age long past, but it feels delightfully modern as well. The tight focus and close up shots reveal each emotion, which makes the audience drink in the characters every word. An example of the dark lighting is the infamous bedroom scene where Mr. Rochester says:

I knew you would do me good in some way.

You know the one. The room is bathed in a navy twilight. The main characters stand out in white, making them seem almost angelic.
All in all, the movie is a bit slow at times, but it picks up every now again. Dario Marianellis score is a fantastic great addition to an already great movie. Fans of films like Pride and Prejudice and Elizabeth will really enjoy this story about a strong independent woman who finds a man that is her equal.",1410220800,2,2867,4.6156862745098035
4490434,2,B004X181TY,"Watched this movie as an On Demand cablevision.  Due to the attempt to shorten the time in order to produce it for the cinema, much was lacking.  The pace was too fast to truly believe the relationship between Jane and Rochester had developed almost overnight.  The acting, as far as it was able to go, was alright.

I would recommend the Toby Stephens or Timothy Dalton versions.  They are true to the book and done as mini-series, so the characters are well fleshed out and the relationship between Jane and Rochester, essentially the centerpiece, is properly paced and believable.  The Toby Stephens version is the most romantic and emotional.

Watch this version for free on cable or rent it for a dollar at Red Box, as it will most likely be a one-shot viewing.  If you want to purchase a version or versions you will watch numerous times, go with the other two mentioned above.",1410048000,4,883,4.651612903225806

4490439,4,B004X181TY,"I should begin, I suppose, by saying that I am not a fan of the book Jane Eyre, nor had I read the book before watching this.  This review is therefore based only on the film.

First of all, the story itself is in most places well told.  The novel is several hundred pages long, and so of course not everything could fit into the film.  As someone who hadn't read the novel, I did feel like there were a couple of things missing.  The ending feels a little overly abrupt, and the development between Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre feels rather abridged.  It doesn't help that, although Fassbender and Wasikowska play their parts wonderfully, convincingly, and with emotion, there is no real chemistry between them.

So the cons are that the story has a couple of holes in it and insufficient chemistry between the leads.  So why did I still give it so many stars?  Well, because those are just about the only flaws.  The cinematography is just right.  The pacing tends to be good.  The framing device works well.  All the characters are well cast and well-acted, including the child Adele.  Fassbender and Wasikowska are the appropriate ages for their roles (Wasikowska was only about a year older than the character when this was filmed, and Fassbender perhaps very slightly younger, but he looks older than he is, so the age/power dynamic was exactly right--unlike in many other versions, where Jane Eyre, who is supposed to be 19, is played by a much older actress).  The settings and costumes are beautiful but bleak, the perfect mix of grey and color.  I've visited the Bronte sisters' house, and this film capture the feel of the area exactly.  I both liked and believed the plotline with St. John.  All the characters were treated with respect.  Enough of the flowery language was kept for the feel without overburdening the viewer.

In short, as an adaptation, I thought this was excellent: it was fairly true to the book (as I said, I looked up the book after seeing the film), fixed some of the problems therewith, and expanded its appeal to a wider audience without watering it down too much.  Is it perfect?  No.  But it is one of the best adaptations I've seen of any classic book.",1408752000,2,2191,4.619170984455959

4490457,3,B004X181TY,"Before I criticize this movie too much, I will say that it followed the book pretty well and that Michael Fassbender was an excellent Rochester. I loved him from the very beginning. That being said, I must go on to the negatives.
I felt that Mia Wasikowska didn't have much depth of character as Jane Eyre. There just seemed to be something missing; sure, she was serious in the book but I felt that here she was too serious, and not light hearted enough. Also, the romance seemed rushed and underdeveloped. The fire in the bedroom scene wasn't as well done as I would have liked; that was a really good part in the book! Important plot details where left out, such as who Adele was and why Rochester decided to court Lady Ingram for a little while. But all of this would have been pardonable if the end had been good. But, sadly, it was not. For those of us who have read the book, we know that they get married, have children, and he recovered his sight. In the movie, it only shows Jane going to Rochester, kissing him, and telling him she won't ever leave him again, or something of the kind, and then the movie ends. They couldn't have added one or two minutes to the movie telling what happened next? I mean, sure, they're together and happy but it was a little depressing too.
I have not seen other versions on this story so I can't recommend a better one, but if you haven't read the book you might be left unsatisfied by this movie. Read the book first.",1405555200,3,1462,4.339416058394161

4490459,4,B004X181TY,"Sure, this retelling isn't perfect or all-inclusive in every detail of the original story (which I love). The flashbacks are oddly timed and the storytelling gets confusing for those not familiar with the plot of the book. They don't even get into explaining some important points, such as why Rochester suddenly invites Blanche Ingram over to Thornfield or how Rochester ended up with Adele.

But I really enjoyed this movie. It focuses more on the heavier Gothic aspects of the Jane Eyre story set to a movingly passionate score. Much of the lighthearted banter between Jane and Mr. Rochester is stripped away - but Rochester still feels appropriately moody, passionate and strange, Jane is quiet but when she speaks her words are thoughtful and profound. She's hard to get at, he speaks plainly in riddles. Emphasized is the earnest undertones of their interactions. In the scene when Jane comes out of her room after the dramatic twist/reveal (where Rochester tries to convince Jane to stay with him) - that was a powerful moment for the characters in the book and this movie actually did it justice. I can't say that for any other adaptation I've seen (and I've seen quite a few!).

The ending feels abrupt. Some of the moody shots of Jane wandering the moors feel overly long. But there is a beauty in this telling - a beauty that makes me enjoy this movie for what it is rather than leaves me wanting for what it is not.",1405296000,,1427,4.704

4490465,2,B004X181TY,"The screenplay makes a hash of the story. I can't imagine what the writer was thinking. The story begins when Jane is running away from Thornfield Hall, which occurs about 2/3 of the way through the book. The film offers no clue who she is or why she is running out onto a bleak landscape in the rain.

From there it only gets worse, with flashbacks to Charlotte Bronte's beginning of the story, then leap-frogging back and forth through the storyline. I can only guess that the screenwriter thought this would increase the drama or suspense. Note to screenwriter: Charlotte Bronte didn't need anyone's ""help"" in the departments of drama and suspense. That is precisely why her original novel was a runaway bestseller when she wrote it and has remained a truly great classic ever since.

4490472,4,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre is a staple for all 9th grade English classes and will ensure all readers who read it at age 14/15 (women, at least) that there is a tremendous audience out there for Chick Books as much as there are Chick Flicks.  While the book is beautifully written, not a lot of the movie interpretations have held up over the years.  This version, however, brings a new light onto this classic gothic tale, which was not an easy feat to accomplish but it was still a good version.

For the sake of repetition which so many or many not know already, the plot:  Jane Eyre is a poor girl who was orphaned as a child and went to live with relatives.  After her uncle dies, the only one of his family who was happy to have here there, Jane is panned off to a boarding school to live an austere, almost nunlike existence.  This changes her from the temperamental child she was to a tightly contained, eager to please young woman who assumes her place in the world as a governess.  She answers and ad for a young girl who needs a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets the dashing Mr. Rodchester, the head of the household.  They fall in love, naturally, and when they are standing before the alter about to marry someone steps forward and says they cannot marry because Mr. Rodchester is already married to the ghost in the attic.  All those bumps and mysterious goings on in place turn out to be Bertha, Mr. Rodchester's insane wife who he has kept locked in the attic for the last fifteen years.  Jane runs away, finds a new family to be with for a flash, and then returns to find Mr. Rodchester blind and the house burned down by Bertha.

This movie, however, begins during Act 3 of the book (Jane's running away from Thornfield Hall) rather than the beginning like so many have before.  Most of the story is told in flashbacks (her childhood, first getting the job at Thornfield Hall, etc.).  Most of the tensions are between her and Sinjohn, the man with her new family who discovers what happened and she actually ran away from the situation.  It's difficult to give a new interpretation to things, especially a classic, and expect them to fly with the audience, for that I give this movie and it's cast/crew complete credit.  That guy who plays Mr. Rodchester is HOT, I will not deny that.  And Mia Wasikowska is a nice Jane Eyre.  While she is not a great beauty in real life, they did a good job of uglying her up to make her look worse than she actually does and more appropriate to Jane Eyre.  Judy Dench is in it as well, a wonderful Mrs. Fairfax if there ever was one.

Any words of criticism?  Not for this movie, but for Jane's actions in the story.  I realize that she ran away for the sake of drama and storytelling.  I also realize that she ran away because it was morally wrong for her to be with Mr. Rodchester while he was, after all, still married and had hidden the wife (granted, a crazy one) from her.  I agreed with her decision when I first read the book years ago, thinking it was morally wrong, but I see things differently now just like everything else.  Perhaps she ran away because she was too afraid of being involved in the situation.  They took away the factor of ""Jane is annoying to run away from him"" very nicely.  And yes, Bertha can't help being crazy, and Rodchester did try to provide for her a bit better than putting her in a nuthouse; but, if you really love a man who is in such a terrible situation, then yes, bend to it and still be with him.  I admit, like all girls do when they read this story, I was 14/15, virginal and unsophisticated.  I am no longer and far more mature now.  And one of the things that you think when you are just that age when you read it as well as something you hold onto until you are in your mid twenties is that women see themselves as a caregiver to the man.  Admittedly, this is from this eager to please good girl mentality that we are lead to believe will make for a happy life when we are older, but that is something for girls not adult women to aspire to.  Hence a lot of other psychology that will lead women to make bad choices in life, but that's another story.  Here, in the only version I'd ever seen where Jane is not the weak little churchmouse who wants to act like a caregiver / nurse to Rodchester (before and after his accident), she returns because she actually loves the man.  But still, this classic remains with us for a reason and will endure.",1402185600,,4444,4.322074788902292

4490474,3,B004X181TY,"This new version of Jane Eyre is rather slow, even when trying to compact a whole novel into two hours. Much of it is boring. What livens it up are the tragic lives of the leads, Jane Eyre, who always tells the truth and is repressed-- she confuses repression with morality. Then there is Edward Fairfax Rochester, a rich lord who wants to enjoy life but can't, as he is restless and has to deal with his insane wife, Bertha Antoinette, who keeps trying to burn down the house and kill her brother--yet, perhaps the brother, Mason, deserves it. His character appears too briefly to know anything about him.
  The major fault with the film is that it shifts back and forth too often, shuffling Jane's life story. The scenes of her schooling are only hinted at, much left out. The story -- novel and filmed versions -- are an indictment of cruelty disguised as morality. It has been described as a Gothic thriller, but Jane Eyre here is more of a morality play, with much suggested and not made explicit. Christianity is up for criticism here, as a structure to destroy one's self-worth and create self-loathing. It is an argument for showing that Christianity is for life-haters.
  As a Gothic it has its stereotypes, many of which in fact pre-date Charlotte Bronte's novel: the poor orphan girl who becomes wealthy, the ruined country estate, the insane wife in the attic -- not even that is original to Jane Eyre. It is merely the most famous example of a Gothic novel.
  This is not really a horror film, it is too quiet to call it that, but it is a tragedy, where injustice and terrors occur. There is a somewhat happy ending, but only of a sort.
  Michael Fassbender makes a good Rochester, but even his performance is restrained, for he too is repressed. This is in fact the point, both Eyre and Rochester are wronged, repressed individuals who find each other, yet a happy ending is not to be. After all, the manor house burns down and he is blind.
  For awhile Jane took comfort with a Minister Saint John, who eventually proclaims to love her, but she realizes she still loves Edward, and she suspects Saint John will be a controlling, hard man; she prefers Edward Rochester and flies to him. Are they happy in the end? Hard to say, as the film ends abruptly.
  The director uses fire in many ways, as light, as warmth, as signals to mysterious events, as a shift in tension. Fire is used an artistic symbol through the film, signifying many things.
  The DVD has 4 extra features, an audio commentary, a feature about the music, and two on the story, with actors and crew making observations on the script and the setting.",1401926400,,2631,4.558386411889597

4490476,4,B004X181TY,"Ok, there are a massive amount of Jane Eyre film versions out there. Michael and Mia play these parts beautifully, it just looses a star for not being quite as complete an adaptation as it should have been. The thinness showed a bit. Judi Dench was her usual fabulous self, and I really loved the choice of Jamie Bell as St. John. He really has a firm hold on the character. It's also filmed at Haddon Hall, like the 2006 miniseries and the Charlotte Gainsborough one was. Haddon IS Thorton. I've been there. It's a bit scary, and it's beautiful. So this is definitely worth a view. It's very well done.

The script was empty while the shallow dialogue, along with the essential missing fragments of the story made you wonder how such a fantastic love story could be so poorly reconstructed. There was no building of the characters and the plot was seemingly cut in half with this half hearted attempt to capture this amazing novel by Bronte. In short it was butchered and if someone is looking for a more accurate and much more entertaining version, I recommend the one by Masterpiece Theater starring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.

4490481,2,B004X181TY,"Despite a great choice in Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester and beautiful cinematography, this Jane Eyre falls flat.  For starters, Mia Wasikowska, as other reviewers have noted, is too understated a Jane, and lacks much of her wit and passion.  She also does not grow much as a character, which is an element central to the book.  I loved Michael Fassbender as Rochester--he did a great job capturing his brooding spirit; however, because there was no chemistry between he and Mia W., the movie falls far short of its potential.

My two favorite versions are the 1980s version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, and the 2006 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke were the textbook characters come to life; Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson were not textually accurate (Toby Stephens was too bright and charming; Ruth Wilson was too pretty), but they brought a new dimension to the characters that the book described, but didn't expound upon at length.  For example, Charlotte Bronte repeatedly described Mr. Rochester as being a great favorite in company for being vivacious and charming, though in conversations throughout the book he is incredibly brooding; Jane is also mentioned occasionally as being ""very pretty"" when she is happy, though of course, because much of her life is sad, she has few opportunities of being so.

Anyway, all in all, two stars.  I wish the leads had been better matched for chemistry--this could have been a very fine version of Jane Eyre.",1400889600,3,1512,4.972222222222222

The disjointed back and forth jumping around in the timeline was also irritating and detracted from the story.  The saving grace of this movie, and the reason that I bought it?  Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  He played the role perfectly, making the character everything it should be.  Mysterious, mischievous, passionate?  Check, check and check.

Though Fassbender could do no wrong in my mind. Jane is brave and charming and even  allowed to be naive without it detracting from her appeal as a heroine. We see her tormented by passion. We see her overcome by joy. And really get the sense that Rochester is improving her life. The couple has a great deal of appealing, natural sexual tension.

4490522,5,B004X181TY,"It would be impossible to translate the richness of Charlotte Bronte's book to film.  But that doesn't mean that what the novel inspires has fallen short.  This film can stand on its own.  It is rich in its own right, with excellent performances from Dame Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax and Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre.  The tension in this film between Rochester and Eyre are sweet and full of tension.  Never has the near touch of two spirits thrown so many sparks on film.",1392249600,2,471,4.4941176470588236

4490526,5,B004X181TY,"I extremely enjoyed this film. As a scholar of 19th-century literature, I understand why some people might object to the plot omissions. However, I believe this is a very successful and innovative adaptation which captures the spirit of Bront, sumptuous in its desolation. The psychological depths of the characters are deftly translated into the language of film. Stunning visuals, and an A+ for Dario Marianelli's Romantic and aetherial score. Michael Fassbender (Rochester) won the awards, but I particularly enjoyed Mia Wasikowska's (Jane's) ability to change her expression without changing her expression.",1391904000,2,611,5.725274725274725

4490537,2,B004X181TY,"This movie had so much possibility - - beautiful scenery, a great cast.  Where it fell short was in a skeletal story line that left the viewer wondering how the characters got from point A to point B.  I can see no motivation for any sane woman to fall in love with this Rochester - - he was growling, surly and broody, without any of the witty banter and kindness that made him so appealing to the Jane Eyre of the novel.  Judy Dench made an excellent Mrs. Fairfax, though, and they did make the most of her character - - probably to get maximum screen time for the only well-known star in the movie.  I have yet to find a movie adaptation of this, one of my favorite novels, which satisfies me, though the best I've seen so far is the BBC mini-series with Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester (though Dalton is entirely too handsome to play Edward Rochester).",1390176000,4,856,4.33125

I have liked much better other endings. This was was too abrupt for me. The actress Mia was excellent. She shows strong emotion in her face, her acting without speaking and that carried the story for me. Mr. Rochester was less forboding that past Mr. Rochester but he did a good job nevertheless ( I mean the actor) I think some of the characters could have been a little more fleshed out because the story and the setting was and always is quite interesting. All in all a good new version. Worth seeing.",1389830400,2,648,4.276422764227642

I am horrified that I think this because this guy is wonderful eye candy, but Rochester is pronounced to be not handsome by Jane and it is really an interesting element in the love story, I think.",1387670400,,462,4.2272727272727275

4490569,5,B004X181TY,"I have seen many adaptations of Jane Eyre and read the book numerous times as well.  I enjoyed this version very much as it was a more modern take on the story that focuses more on Jane and Rochester's relationship than on Jane's tortured youth and upbringing.  Wasikowska's Jane seemed strong and confident which was a bit of a departure from the original. Michael Fassbender was mesmerizing, as usual, but too young (and handsome) really to play the Rochesger character. The Jane Eyre adaptation with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough is still my favorite and closest to the original book, but this is a good one too.",1385424000,,625,4.831775700934579

4490571,5,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre (2011) 5 stars 

Based on the book by Charlotte Bront. I read the book decades ago so what I remember is vague. I do recall liking Jane. I thought she was a strong female character. And that I wasn't to impressed with Mr. Rochester. The story was interesting. Focusing on Jane Eyre, a young orphan who becomes a governess to Adele Varens. I really imagined the Thornfeild mansion as a dark and gloomy place.

This 2011 British movie was really good. Like I said, it's been a while since I've read the book so I couldn't judge on the comparison. I did think it was really good in creating the mood that the book has. The mansion was just as dark and gloomy as I thought it should be. I liked Mia Wasikowska as Jane. She kind of grew on me as I watched this. I think Michael Fassbender got me to like Mr. Rochester. I really liked him and thought he was the perfect Rochester. I also really liked Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers and Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax. They all did a good job. I've watched bits and pieces of it before today. Now I'm glad I watched this through. I really liked this. It's on my Christmas wish-list now.",1384732800,,1133,4.236111111111111

I think the Masterpiece Theatre version is truer to the novel; it is longer and develops the plot better, but I love this one just about as much. I watch both.",1384560000,,463,4.716049382716049

This is definitely one of the better interpretations of the Bronte classic although I'm not sure anyone will ever top the Orson Welles version.",1384300800,,453,4.6125

The scenery and costumes are as beautiful. I love the dramatic way this movie starts, if you do know the story your heart will break for Jane from the opening scene, knowing what's happening.

4490601,2,B004X181TY,"I just watched a faux Jane Eyre almost marry a faux Mr. Rochester. This was the story of a hot older boss beguiling and tricking a petrified naive and chaste young woman because she was readily available, and then obsessing over her when she left. The relationship boiled down to just plain creepy.... he was just way too nice to the point of sympathy, and she was way too dull and apathetic to the point of ""why in heck would he notice her in the first place?"" And it seems the only reason this faux Jane would even marry him is because he proposed, he had money, or she was sincerely surprised that her teacher-to-pupil like crush actually had feelings for her. If this Jane left her boss/wannabe lover because of principles of her character, that was not discussed or established in the movie. If you had never read the book, you would think she left because she was made a fool out of or just felt stupid... a sentiment I never got while reading. I mean... I even noticed that she kept looking at this one painting of the naked lady on the wall and wondering... Jane, this is your maturity level? Not in the book I read! Maybe they should have had Jane narrate some to fill in the blanks of her character because in the movie she had none. Outside the context of the actual book itself, the only character I found remotely interesting in the movie was St. John, but simply because I saw more character development with him than any other character in the movie. But they totally left out the fact that he and his sisters were her cousins!!! Why in heck would she give 3/4 of her inheritance away to people who she may have known for at most a year? Without the family part... that just sounds stupid, even if they did save her life; it's not like she wasn't working. I was surprised how upset that made me. It sounded contrived in the book when I first read it (a long time ago), but I learned to appreciate that detail, especially when St. John actually ""proposed.""

A few years ago I watched the 2006 miniseries by purchasing the DVD, and absolutely loved it. Lost the DVD in a move and hadn't thought about it in a while. But Jane Eyre is my all time favorite book, so I decided to get this DVD in a collection with three other movies (including 2005 Pride & Prejudice, which I thought was excellent). This movie had me tearing up my room looking for the 2006 version, to no avail. So I just reordered it. I was so mad after watching this movie, and I've never been what people call ""a purist."" It's just what's the point of making a Jane and Edward with no chemistry? Or a Jane with no passion? Or a Jane Eyre movie where the biggest climax is the secret in the attic? Most people know that fact before the read the book or watch the movie; it the great relationship between Jane and Mr Rochester in the book and their character development, and the way it is described in such a way by Charlotte Bronte that I think only she could make a relationship between  a 18 year old girl and her 38 year old manipulative boss not creepy in the slightest.

I gave it two stars because the scenery was pretty. And Judi Dench is excellent regardless.

There is an immediate connection between Rochester and Jane though they may not see it as quickly as we do.  The delivery of lines completely natural and non-affected.
The other aspects of the film - costumes, scenery, scene setting etc. are impeccable.

4490610,3,B004X181TY,"I had very high hopes for this film, despite thinking it was too soon for another adaptation. I mean, the 2006 BBC miniseries was released less than five years before this one! As much as I love Jane Eyre, I do think think there's such a thing as adaptation overload. I can't help but feel that they could have adapted another work instead.
Overall, my view on the film is that it is a disappointment. It could have been great but it did not meet my expectations. One of my main problems was the structure. The film starts out with Jane fleeing Thornfield and being found by the Rivers. Any scenes from before that point are flashbacks, occasionally coming back to a scene in the ""present"" at Moor House. I remember reading about this choice before the film came out and being hesitant, but I thought it might come out better than I expected. Unfortunately, it did not. The flashback structure was confusing for my friends who did not read the book. To me, it was just an annoyance. I get that they were trying to do something different, but it just didn't work for me in practice.
I think that the film could have benefited from about 10-20 extra minutes of run-time. A lot of the explanations and backstories are cut out. What really bothered me about this is that it looked like more things were actually originally filmed, but left on the cutting room floor. The DVD confirmed my suspicions on some of this- plenty of deleted scenes on it should have been left in the film, IMO! I do not know why some of them were cut. Because I saw the film with several people who did not read the book, I know that a lot of it was confusing. And for me, even though I knew the backstory, I was just irritated not to see it! One major thing I felt they should have done with extra time would be to show more buildup to Jane and Rochester's relationship. Some of their scenes together are great, but they needed more of these before they actually got engaged to show and explain their growing attraction more.
As to the actors, I found much of the acting to be understated. In some cases I liked this approach more than in others. Mia Wasikowska is not plain, but I thought they made her look the part well enough in terms of age and stature. I found her acting, however, to be underwhelming. I thought her performance was too restrained. In the proposal scene, in particular, I thought she held back too much. I don't want Jane to be over the top, but I wanted a little more passion. A lot of focus in this version seemed to be put on Jane wanting freedom and developing into a woman, but I could have done without the scene of her examining the painting of a naked lady. Not that I had any issues with the picture, but the scene accomplished nothing (that time could have been better spent elsewhere) and this ""nude image"" was part of the reason the film got a PG-13 rating. While Michael Fassbender was also a bit more restrained than some other actors (especially compared to Timothy Dalton, my favorite), I liked his performance more than Mia's. The two did have good chemistry, but there just weren't enough scenes to show them falling in love. Bertha, I felt to have not enough of a presence. Grace Poole was really just in the background and so there was never any of Jane suspecting her. Bertha herself was not as menacing as she could have been. I suppose they did not want to be offensive but she just wasn't scary enough. The Rivers siblings were all good in their roles, but I was not a fan of the change made to their relationship with Jane.
I don't want to make it seem like I completely hated this film, because I didn't. I thought that the scenes of Jane's childhood were particularly well-done, especially given the short time-frame. Many individual scenes were great. On the whole, I just found it to be slightly lacking. I want a director's cut!",1374537600,5,3854,4.4372355430183354

A few have come close but, still, no cigar.  I saw this production not expecting much just because of the two-hours or so constriction of modern movies.

It starts out well.  I like the flash back approach to a story we all know.  Mia Wasikowska is just right as Jane and Michael Fassbender's Rochester, too, is believable and refreshingly not dour.  I always enjoy seeing Jamie Bell in anything and his dour St. John Rivers is fine.  Add in Dame Judi Dench, a lush Victorian setting and an eerie, mysterious presence in the gothic Thornfield Manor and you should have everything you want in a new Jane Eyre.

You can see what went wrong by viewing the deleted scenes, especially two which are critical to the story.  One depository scene explains Adele's presence and the other is the scene in which the madwoman creeps into Jane's bedroom and tears her wedding veil!  The inclusion of those scenes plus extending the very abrupt ending just a little bit would have left me with ""wow"" instead of ""that's it?"" and I would have rated it as five stars.",1373760000,3,1191,4.570754716981132

4490621,5,B004X181TY,"**This review is full of spoilers --sorry!**
After our recent time spent driving through the Yorkshire moors and visiting the Bront Parsonage museum, I decided to watch this 2011 version of Jane Eyre again last night with the director's commentary on as I worked at diminishing my huge sewing pile.

Colours are one of the first things I notice about a movie I'm watching.  With this particular film I am always instantly struck by the stunning colour palette. Mossy greys, forest greens, earthy browns, a few rare glimpses of russet reds.  Black shadows... deep and dark, pierced only by lonely candles or dim golden firelight. Truly evocative of an electricity-free 1840s England, this lighting --or lack of lighting-- style has resulted in a drama that is more realistically shaded than than most period films.  In nighttime scenes, we see little more than faces lit only by the candles they are carrying.  The surrounding darkness is intense, alive, and sometimes oppressive.

This is the first version of Jane Eyre in which I've been fully impressed with the portrayal of the title character.  I was gratified by Mia Wasikowska's accurate interpretation of Jane's strength and inner courage. After feeling disappointment with Ruth Wilson's pretty but meek and mild performance in the 2006 TV miniseries, it was refreshing to watch Wasikowska embody Jane's self-possessed yet passionate personality brilliantly.  Director Cary Fukinaga has chosen to capture on film only what Jane herself would have seen, which completely makes this all about Jane --rightly so.  The only exception is a brief moment when Mr Rochester discovers Jane's open window, and her flight from Thornfield.  This scene is blended with his voice calling out to her across the miles that separate them, so she is instantly connected to it anyhow.

Michael Fassbender carries off Mr Rochester's rudeness and generally abrupt manner quite well, as described in the novel.  He expresses a less fierce Rochester than the novel does, but this is in keeping with the movie's approach.  There is an austere dreamlike quality to the entire film due to the restrained screenplay and understated filming style that imparts a softer feel to the plot and characters.  Actors playing Mr Rochester usually have a field day with their character. He is portrayed as loud and larger than life, completely dwarfing Jane in personality, wealth, humour, and looks.  An appropriate amount of restraint in the interpretation of Mr Rochester, for this movie, is a welcome change from previous versions; after all, the novel is titled Jane Eyre --not Rochester!

A less important but yet rather key detail of this film is the fact that the characters of Jane and Rochester are played by actors of ages accurate to those in the novel.  Eighteen-year-old Wasikowska plays nineteen-year-old Jane, and Fassbender is at least thirty, or looks it. Wasikowska is small, with a childlikeness about her that conveys the naive Jane's character well.  Other film versions, for me, have been less believable just because of the inaccuracy of the casting.

Moira Buffini's screenplay is filled with direct quotes from Charlotte Bront's novel.  Many well-loved lines, such as ""A mere reed she feels in my hand! I could bend her with my finger and thumb!"", and ""Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?"" are in.  Others, less congenial to the bare story this movie is telling, such as ""Reader, I married him"" are out.  It's refreshing to see a film adaptation of a classic novel that doesn't feel the need to drastically change the language or the plot in order to make the movie watchable.

In the director's commentary, Cary Fukunaga mentions his desire to strip the story down to its key elements and thus increase the emotional impact of the film, all within the time constraints.  I've seen other directors attempt less successfully to do this [notably Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice], but here Fukunaga's strategy works, probably because of Moira Buffini's brilliant screenplay.  There is one scene --straight from the book-- after Jane's discovery of Rochester's duplicity on their wedding day, when she leaves her room for a drink of water only to stumble over Rochester on the threshold.  The conversation that takes place between them afterwards is one of the most evocative passages in the book, and so stark in its description of Jane's moral struggle that early reviewers of Jane Eyre derided Bront's novel as ""coarse"".  In many film versions, this scene is either out or edited strangely.  Here it is completely stripped of its original verbosity and yet still faithfully rendered through a few accurately chosen lines, in an emotionally impacting scene that is heartrending and raw.  Rochester's sense of his own power and his inability to use it because of his love for Jane [""A mere reed she feels in my hand! I could bend her with my finger and thumb!""] and Jane's desperation [""God help me!""] are perfectly acted.

Those who have read the book will have no difficulty following the story of Jane Eyre as this movie portrays it.  For watchers who haven't, I think they might have some questions.

If I had not read the book, I might be wondering why Jane falls in love with Rochester in the first place.  The movie veers quite close to a rather strange interpretation of this, making it possible to believe that Jane is merely a lonely, persuadable schoolgirl and Rochester is selfishly using her as an escape from his tarnished past in an attempt to return to a more innocent time in his life when his memory was ""without blot or contamination"".  However in the novel, Charlotte Bront clearly shows us that her feelings for Rochester arise out of a sense of an intellectual connection: a meeting of the minds and a bond between their spirits.

Also, I would question Rochester's wife Bertha's madness after watching this version.  We see her for all of three minutes -rather calm ones, at that- and the blood-chilling dream-to-reality scene in which she rips Jane's wedding veil in two makes no appearance in this adaptation.

Both of these plot gaps are only a result of the lack of time to tell the story.  Yes, this is the ""cliff notes"" version of Jane Eyre.  There is a fast-paced feel to what is actually a very slow story.  As with any film struggling to fit a many-layered, complex 500-page piece of literature into less than two hours of screen time [again, ""Pride and Prejudice"" 2005] we are missing a few scenes and narrative that define key developments in the plot.  In order to cram the story into the typical two hours, sacrifices have been made --thus the minor plot omissions-- leaving those unfamiliar with the novel unable to fully appreciate the story.

I love the way the film begins in the last third of the book and then plays catch-up for the remainder of the movie.  It is very well executed, and works perfectly.  Someone who hasn't read the novel might disagree with me on that, but I thought it was an effective and unique method of visually interpreting the book!  The abrupt ending was refreshing. I often feel, while reading the final few pages of Jane Eyre, that Bront is rushing to provide a satisfactory postscript to the story of every single character in the plot, just as many traditional movies love to do.  Sometimes less is more; and this film's pared-down, succinct contrast was superbly executed.

This movie is a version made by those who've read the book and love it, for those who've read the book and love it",1371859200,6,7565,4.911163522012578

A movie never does a book justice, so I was not expecting this from this version. However, I thought I would enjoy it, because it is ""Jane Eyre."" In my opinion, this version didn't put much effort into character development, and for me to enjoy a movie, I need to be emotionally connected with the characters. Also, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the main characters, another ""must"" for me especially in a romance. Masterpiece Theatre's 2007 version is by far the best version in my opinion. I cared about the main characters, and the chemistry between them developed strongly through the film. If you are like me and want to see every version, then watch it and make your own assessment.

4490626,4,B004X181TY,"There are so many things that I love about this adaptation of the classic novel. Where do I begin?

1) Story-line stays fairly true to the original -- I know that movies cannot be 17-hour sagas, and that the stories must be streamlined. Thankfully, this version kept to the major plot points and did not take poetic license with the story. The original was good enough to be named a classic, right, so what makes you think you can do it better?

2) Excellent choice for Rochester -- Michael Fassbender is the most passionate Rochester I have ever seen on film. Other actors give R just a little too much of the stiff upper lip. Yes, that is one aspect of his at times acerbic personality, but it's not all there is to him! If it were, we would find it very difficult to believe why Jane fell in love with him in the first place!

3) Excellent choice for Jane -- In addition to being a wonderful actress, Mia Wasikowska has the perfect facial features and skin to be able to pull off the drastic hairstyle that this role requires. Let's face it, that middle part, slicked-back hair-do doesn't really flatter anyone. And yes, we know Jane is supposed to be ""plain"", but if I wanted to look at an ugly woman for 2 hours, I could just people watch at Walmart... This Jane has a simple, subtle beauty that becomes Rochester's description of her: that she has an elf-like, other-worldly look about her.

4) Cinematography is fresh! -- *SPOILER ALERT* Rather than going chronologically as traditional adaptations have done, the movie starts as Jane is fleeing Thornfield. When she is taken in and questioned by the Rivers', her childhood is done as a flashback. The story goes back and forth slightly until the plot-line meets up with itself, then continuing in chronological order. This may sound jumbled and sporadic, and maybe even confusing if you don't know the story, but in actuality it is done with a great deal of finesse.

Phew! I got so caught up in talking about why I love this movie that I almost forgot my reason for bumping it down from 5 to 4 stars.

*SPOILERS & Complaints*

1) If you YouTube the deleted scenes, and you know the story, you'll find that at least one important plot point has been omitted. In the finished product, Rochester never explains to Jane how he came to be Adele's guardian. There is no mention of his affair with the opera dancer, or any inclination that he was previously unfaithful to his wife. Well, judge for yourself on that one, but I think that was an important omission, and the deleted scene is so short that I don't think it warranted being cut out. The fact that Rochester has been unfaithful to his wife (insane though she may be) is part of his darker side, and one of the reasons Jane resolves to leave Thornfield. She doesn't want to be just another of Rochester's mistresses, and she's afraid that he will eventually discard her once he is no longer enamored with her.

2) I wish that the ""horse-chestnut"" tree had been played up more. That is a very crucial symbol in the book and foreshadows much about their relationship; I think it could have had great screen-potential for dramatic effect.

3) No gypsy? Oh well. I suppose most versions love to keep the Gothic element, but that scene is just so funny! [If you have no clue what I'm talking about, read the book]

4) Rochester is still too pretty at the end. He's supposed to be blinded AND disfigured, in that he loses his left hand (or the use of it at the very least). Some would say, ""Really? That bothers you?"" Well, a little, yes. Rochester has learned his lesson and basically his penance is in the loss of his physical beauty to a certain extent... But Jane's love is strong enough to see through it. I think in leaving Rochester only scruffy and partially blinded diminishes the strength of Jane's love by comparison.

Overall, no movie adaptation is perfect, but this one is as close as it gets! I would DEFINITELY recommend it!",1371340800,3,3946,4.543661971830986

4490628,3,B004X181TY,"When it comes to adapting classic novels, many pitfalls abound. Fans naturally have their favorite parts and their own impressions of characters. The story is probably too big to be covered comprehensively. Related, films tell stories in different ways from written words so some alterations and abridgements are necessary.

This movie version of Jane Eyre is faithful to the book. It follows events mostly in the same order, though the movie begins with her flight from Thornfield Hall. The story before that is inter-cut with her arrival and life with the Rivers family. The settings are quite realistic, with the bleak moors and the dark buildings matching the novel's descriptions. The world of Jane Eyre is well-realized and atmospheric.

The plot is a mixture of too much being left in and too much being left out. All the major movements are in this movie: living as a child with her aunt, going to Lowood School, working as a governess at Thornfield Hall, interacting with Rochester, separating from Thornfield and Rochester under fantastic circumstances, living with the Rivers, etc. With only two hours of screen time, a lot of the details are left out of each of these. For instance, Blanche Ingram makes her appearance as a romantic rival for Rochester's affections. He seems to have genuine affection for her in the film but his ultimate choice of Jane has no inciting incident as it does in the book. The gypsy fortune-teller scene is not in the movie and nothing substitutes for the revelations of Blanche's superficiality and Jane's perceptivity. If the film makers had, for example, relegated the Lowood part of the story to a two-minute conversational recap at Thornfield they would have had more time to fully develop this part of the story. As a movie, I don't think it held the story together well enough.

The performances are generally good, though I thought Mia Wasikowska was a little too understated as Jane. Jane in the novel has a lot more passion and wit, though perhaps readers have more access to that since the narrative is told by her. In the movie, we are in a third-person narrative without access to her thoughts and feelings except for what the actress shows us. I thought the performance was a bit too reserved. The performance is serviceable but not great. Michael Fassbender is good as Rochester and Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.

The movie ultimately feels like a Cliff's Notes version of the book with a couple of pages missing. The deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some of the holes but not all of them. The highlights of the book are in the film but what makes Jane Eyre a great story and her a great character doesn't come across. People who haven't read the book won't see what all the fuss is about; people who have (like me) will make a fuss about what isn't there.",1371168000,2,2812,4.756147540983607

Jane Eyre also grew on me over the years. As I aged I gained an appreciation for the emotion and depth of the story, all the turns and pitfalls, the love for the characters. And who doesn't love a happy ending?

So as I've perused through the many different film adaptations I've always felt something wanting. They never really captured the raw emotion of the book as well as the 2011 Focus Feature's version I watched tonight. I loved the way the story transitioned and the actors who played the parts.

4490635,3,B004X181TY,"Charlotte Bronte's novel has been adapted so many times for the cinema that it becomes difficult to distinguish between various versions.  Orson Welles' Mr. Rochester sticks in the mind, not so much for its closeness to what Bronte might have imagined, but for its sheer bravura.  Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane Eyre was a waif with a surprising strength of character.  This version has a winsome performance by Mia Wasikowska as the eponymous heroine; an innocent trying to make her way in a world apparently peopled by sadists and rapacious men.  Michael Fassbender turns in a one-note characterization of Rochester; all smoldering eyes and winsome expressions, he wheedles his way into Jane's heart to such an extent that she cannot forget him.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, as Jane reunites with the (now-blind) Rochester in a gesture of reconciliation, without there being any justification for such a move.  Rochester in the main behaves despicably, as does Jamie Bell as Rivers.  The film contains the usual visual clichs associated with costume drama - old houses, period costumes and slow-moving shots of the landscape in vivid autumn colors.

Although this version does not include many of the details that make the novel enjoyable to read, no movie has ever done a book perfect justice. That being established, I love the way this movie interprets the heart of Jane Eyre in a format that is captivating and exciting enough for the big screen. Jane's life, though chronological and delightfully detailed in the book, takes an exciting weave through time in the film. It is as if the literature allows you to live life with Jane Eyre while the film lets you travel through her most vivid memories. This creative take on the classic tale is more than adequate in displaying the true nature of her personage (There is no way reveal the minds of the actors. We rely on body language, camera angles and dialogue to display what the character's feelings and intentions are in a movie). The personalities and the emotions portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, Michael Fassbender and Judi Dench are far closer to the imagination of the reader than the other Jane Eyre films before it. It is far more important for me to see the heart of the work lived out rather than witness a few hours of scrutinous detail.

It was well-written, had excellent acting, beautiful cinematography, great music and maintained the spirit of the novel. It has been a while since I read the book, but the hardest part of the book to incorporate into a movie I think - the end with the Rivers family - was handled well through flashbacks. That gave the film an exciting edge from the very beginning. The one thing I don't think was included in this version was Jane's familial relationship with this family, but that was minor and didn't affect the rest of the film. The only other movie version I've seen is the one with William Hurt as Rochester, and I thought it was boring.

I got butterflies in my stomach, I cried at the appropriate moments and it made me want to read the book which I did and now is my favorite book of all time!

So I have Mr. Fassbender to thank for making me find my favorite book of all time!

The film is about Jane Eyre(Mia Wasikowska), an orphan who is disliked/hated by her ""family"" and is shipped off to a cruel school. She grows up looking for a Governess position and finds it at Thornfield Hall, teaching a little French girl. There she meets the manor owner, Mr. Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and finds what she never expected in her life:love.

It is a beautifully directed film that touches the innercore of Jane's soul. Although the novel lets you read Jane's thoughts, it is tried in this film with scenes of Jane pondering in her room or in a garden which are perfect substitution to (instead) the cliched voiceovers. It is a beautiful film that (at the time) left me not knowing what was gonna happen until the end of the film.

IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK: Watch the film first and if it stikes you as much as it did me,go get the book and happy reading!

4490669,2,B004X181TY,"Of the four adaptions of the novel by Charlotte Bronte that I have seen this one is my least favorite.  The biggest flaw, for myself, was the casting of the two main characters, in particular Mia Wasikowski as the Jane Eyre.  To begin with, in the novel, Jane Eyre was small in stature.  This is a vital apect to the story as her physical demeanor is in direct opposition to her great principles and strong character.  In this adaption her stature was of medium size and the fact that Dame Judith Densch was so much smaller than she made it even more obvious.  The fact that Michael Fassbinder is a handsome man was less distracting because, in general, most of the actors playing Mr. Rochester were in fact very handsome and he did an adequate job in his portrayal but Ms. Wasikowski kept the same expression on her face the entire film.

Another problem with this adaption was that, as in other adaptions, two hours in not enough time to do full justice to the film.  One of the best and most interesting parts of the novel are the conversations between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  While Jane is not equal to Mr. Rochester in money they are equal in intelligence and in strength of their convictions.  That is what is so appealing to him about Jane.  Although obviously coming from a difficult childhood Jane Eyre refuses to believe she is any less an individual and never feels sorry for past shortcomings.  The conversations are imperative as Mr. Rochester tries time after time to break down Jane's hard exterior to no avail.  In this film there is only one strong dialogue between the two making their ultimate love story less plausible.

I will say give kudos to the cinematography, set direction and costuming as they were all very well done.  The gothic almost ghostlike quality of story was almost achieved.  I did not, as in other adaptions, ever feel put into the hypnotic trance that actually brought me, as the film viewer, to feel swept away to the moors and castles of England in the mid-1800s.

My favorite adaption is the 1983 ten part BBC miniseries starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  If you have not seen it I would most highly recommend it as the adaption that most mirrors the novel.  I have yet to see any actress play Jane as well as Zelah Clarke.  She is petite yet composed and at times fierce in her convictions.  The fact that the mini-series is great in length does the novel its most justice.  Timothy Dalton was quite young at the time but I believe it is his best work to date.  Although exceedingly handsome his composure is perfect for the role.  Their conversations are the most intense and genuine.  Without continuing to make this review more of promotion for the mini-series I will end by saying that if you want to see the best the adaption of the novel the 2011 one is not it.",1361836800,4,2821,4.551587301587301
4490670,3,B004X181TY,"This version of Jane Eyre reminds me all over again of the importance of good casting. The production values are excellent, a lot of attention was paid to historical accuracy (including the dimness of pre-electricity mansions!), and views of the countryside are magnificent. But the story itself is not emotionally satisfying. Michael Fassbinder is currently a hot, popular and well-reviewed actor, which is why he was hired to play Mr. Rochester. Readers, Rochester he ain't. The problem is not just with Fassbinder's appearance, although he doesn't physically resemble Bronte's Rochester. He looks wrong.  Edward Rochester's darkness is referred to often in the book--his black hair, dark eyes and dark complexion--and for Bronte they symbolized his precious ""apartness"" from conventional English blondness, and also his spiritual darkness before Jane entered his life. And Bronte's Rochester, beneath his gruff exterior, has a good and kind heart. Fassbinder's Rochester is not just arrogant, he's chronically rude, selfish and indifferent to the suffering of others. Fassbinder has no feeling for Rochester's genuineness of character, the depth of perception that ties him to Jane. His playing of the role is shallow, even condescending. Bronte's Jane would not have loved him. And there goes the whole story.",1361750400,3,1313,5.532338308457711

4490675,5,B004X181TY,"With over 25 film adaptations of the iconic Charlotte Bronte novel, it would be a near impossibility for anyone to select a favorite, much less identify the penultimate adaptation. I have personally viewed five, and it's difficult enough to select a favorite with only that limited viewing; but of these, my favorite is the 2005 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries. And that is because in order to flesh out the novel to any degree and to fully develop the characters, a miniseries format is almost a necessity. But there are some excellent theatrical adaptations too - the 1996 Franco Zeffirelli version with Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt and the 1997 Robert Young version, with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, come to mind; and both are superb. This one is on a par with both of them and if I had to pick a favorite, I'd select this one...they are all 5-star films though and all very highly recommended. The performance of Australian actress, Mia Wasikowski, is my primary reason for placing this one at the top of the list. Having recently re-read the novel, I'm convinced the characterization of Jane, as portrayed by the very young Wasikowski, is closer to what Bronte had in mind. The appearance of Dame Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax is also a scale tipper; and director, Cary Fukunaga's decision to emphasize the Gothic elements of the story also elevates this adaptation in my eyes. The casting - aside from Wasikowski and Dench - is also spot-on. If you've never seen a film adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" you won't be disappointed by queuing this one up first; but after you watch this, queue up one of the fine miniseries adaptations to gain a full appreciation of the novel...and by all means read the novel.",1361145600,9,1717,4.804054054054054

  I love Jane Eyre. I grew up watching the Masterpiece Theater version on Sunday nights. The first time I read the book was in middle school. So, needless to say, I was super excited when I heard there was another adaptation of the book being produced. We bought the DVD as soon as it came out. All I can say was that I was kind of disappointed. For people who have never read the book they would have gotten the general gist of the movie. But I felt like if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't really know  the story this adaptation portrayed. The actors of this movie I really enjoyed were Judi Dench and Tamzin Merchant. I'm slightly inclined to like Mia Wasikowska, though, because we have the same birth day and because I really enjoyed her in the modern Alice in Wonderland.
  The movie only seem to hit the top events which made it confusing. I was able to follow along because I've read the book. But I found myself adding in the parts the movie didn't have. The setting was wonderful and Focus Features seemed to get the clothes right. But she was still too done up for the character Jane. I gave this movie three stars because it wasn't completely horrible and I could tolerate watching it again.

For example, Jane is not the most beautiful woman but her character shines through. I own several movie versions of the same novel and I believe this is the best one. The music score enhances each scene by highlighting the moment.  The period costumes were true to the time and not overly done.  If one is not sympatheic to poor Jane when she is sent away to the orphanage, that person is heartless. Her experience there is portrayed as truly horrible as is her life while living with her aunt. Mr. Rochester is suitably cast for the character and appeared bigger than life.  Jane is surprisingly tough for a woman, but when considering she has been raised with very little, one must imagine a girl who is a survivor as our heroine appeared in the movie.

That being said, it's been singular that until this there hadn't really been a satisfying adaptation of JANE EYRE since the Robert Stevenson version from the 1940s with Joan Fontaine (who was, admittedly, too pretty and too docile to be a believable Jane Eyre) and Orson Welles. But this one, directed by Cary Juji Fukunaga is pretty good. The moors are shot gorgeously, to make them look like nothing else on earth; the score by Dario Marinelli, is just about perfect (atmospheric and romantic without being intrusive); and the two leads, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, are quite fine--both are attractive, yet neither is so classically pretty that it seems unlikely they would describe one another as plain. Granted, the story is too rushed; but how else are you going to shoehorn in 500 pages worth of plot into a two-hour movie? (Remarkably, they even manage to get the St. John Rivers story into here, which the Stevenson version eschewed.) Its only other failing is that it's probably not scary enough: you don't get the great architectural sense of Gothic space and the looking ""third story"" that you do, say, in the Stevenson version.

For one thing, there isn't enought foreshadowing of the madwoman in the attic. In fact, in the book the madwoman creeps into Jane's room the night before the wedding, rips her wedding veil, and holds a candle to Jane's face and blows it out. This is one of the most frightening moments in this gothic/romantic novel, and it is left out in the film. Grace Poole as a character is practically absent, and her presence is important bc Rochester tells Jane that Grace is responsible for the mysterious happenings at night. The courtship between Mr. R and Jane is too rushed and comes across as unbelievable. I showed this film to my students and they were completely shocked when Mr. R proposed, which demonstrates the lack of romantic chemistry the actors had in the film. If you had no knowledge of JE before seeing the film, then the characters' relationship would not be convincing. I liked the flashback technique and the film was visually beautiful, but other than that it does not measure up the the book. The best version I've seen is the Masterpiece Theatre mini-series.

4490708,4,B004X181TY,"I've read Jane Eyre too many times to count, but have only seen two film adaptations....this one and the one by Masterpiece Theater.  The MT version is far and away my favorite. I realize that a 2 hour production is going to have to leave some important things out, and for the most part I think they did a fine job in telling the overall story.  But even so I have three complaints.

First, there is dialogue in this version that doesn't exist in the book.  By my thinking, there is really no reason to veer away from the book and to make up new dialogue, even in trying to shorten the story. It just seemed too foreign to the story.

Second, they left out entirely the fact that Jane is actually related to St. John and his sisters and go to lengths to invent that Jane wishes them to be family.  Silly.  It wouldn't have taken more time to develop this part of the story, and in leaving it out, miss one of the truly lovely aspects of Jane...her desire to be a part of a family even more than the thrill of being an heiress.

Which comes to my last complaint: although the casting was excellent, I found that there just wasn't very much emotion, particularly in the development of the relationship between Jane and Rochester.  I mean, holy moly, in the MT version, in the scene after the first fire, you can feel the emotion flooding out of the screen.  It's palpable.  But in this film, they seem to go through the motions but there's just no feeling.  And this ruins it for me.  One of the striking things about Jane Eyre is the contrast between the starkness of Jane's life (and for that matter the coldness of the moor and Thornfield hall) and the emotion that grows between Jane and Rochester. Plus there was no trace of the play between the two characters, by which I mean the light-hearted playing with words and teasing that comes through so well in the MT film.

So overall, it was enjoyable because it's Jane Eyre.  It's lovely to look at. But just missing some spark.",1347926400,2,1981,4.3743169398907105

4490712,1,B004X181TY,"To preface my review, I have read ""Jane Eyre"" the book and seen at least 5 adaptations of it in movies... I can  can safely say - this is one of the worst. Granted Timothy Dalton's version is cheesy to an extent, but given special effects at the time.... but I digress.

In a nutshell - Mia Wasikowska is terrible. Literally she spends the majority of the movie with 1 of 2 expressions on her face: apoplectic fear or menstrual cramps. I am not saying she is experiencing either, but that is what her face reads throughout the entire film. It really is quite bad and is so distracting, that you can't give any creedance to the strong and epic role of Jane Eyre. Michael Fassbender in the part of Mr. Rochester isn't bad, just not as believable in either his fierceness or his ardor as I have seen other actors do better in the role.

And by the word ""film"" - I mean that the directors decided to take that approach with the story. Perhaps this was their way of recreating the wheel with a spookier environment and feeling of unease with the odd angles, limited speech, inconsistent lighting, etc. In my opinion - the story speaks for itself when well acted, you don't need to embellish or flourish with ""artsy"" interpretation. It was more distracting than enhancing.

The only twinkling spark in the film is that the scene BEFORE Jane runs away was included. This is in the book and can seem anti-climactic to the tragedy of Mr. Rochester's big secret being revealed - so it's not often included in movie versions of Jane Eyre. I was happy to see this scene included in this adaptation - because it is poignant and heart wrenching. However, it was ruined quickly by Mia Wasikowska's lack of acting and facial contortions.

Mia Wasikowska performance is brilliant, I love the fact that she is noble, intelligent and intense at the same time.  Without being too dramatic she communicates her inner strength and turmoil.

Fassbender is superb, he has the spirit for the character.  He is a tormented soul who finds peace in Jane's unique personality and love.  They had chemistry, and the level of connection was very natural and intense.  The film is a tribute to real love.  That love that is so real and so powerful that can change ones life forever.",1344902400,6,664,4.8053097345132745

sensational performance by Mia Wasikowska in the lead.  She was nominated for the
academy award, shld have received it.

Tho this version has its flaws, her performance, plus an A- performance by Michael Fassbender in the male lead & an A grade performance by Judi Dench in a supporting
role make this a very emotionally involving movie.  The directing,by Gary Joji Fukunaga, based on what one sees on the screen, is outstanding & the sound track superb, setting just the right mood for some of the emotionally charged scenes.

Jane is supposed to be 20 years younger (& about 20)than Rochester.  In this case, the principals have in fact a l2 year age difference, greater than in prior versions.  Jane & Rochester are both better looking than descrbed in book & Jane
isn't small.  But so what, take the movie on its own terms.

Flaws: I didn't like the use of flashbacks, a sequential presentation is/wld be, better.  It ended on a wonderful dramatic note/mood.  Yet I think the film shld
provide the info that they married, has 2 children, & Rochester regained the sight in one eye, as in the book.  Why not have the ending as upbeat as the book.
This info cld have been conveyed in writing on the screen after the acting portion
ends.

Also, I wished the movie wld have been longer, quite a bit of the story had to be
cut to fit into a 2 hr slot.  Perhaps the home dvd cld have been longer: there
are some cut scenes but they don't amount to much.

But talk about drama & romantic chemistry & passion on the screen - this movie has
it to the nth degree &, even with some flaws, is a masterpiece in my book.
Hats off to the participants, esp Ms. Wasikowska.

4490715,5,B004X181TY,We love all the Jane Austin remakes.  This one is particularly atmospheric and visually stunning.  Our 17 y.o. wanted this.,1341878400,,123,5.1
4490716,5,B004X181TY,"This production of Jane Eyre is gorgeous.

It's also moving.

Mia Wasikowska is perfect as Jane: reticent, feisty, clear-eyed, young.  You can almost watch her grow and develop as the movie goes along.  And she has one of those faces that is infinitely malleable--plain and withdrawn one moment, electric and beautiful the next, and at all times convincing.

Michael Fassbender is also terrific.  I had seen him in several things--X Men, Inglourious Basterds, Dangerous Method--and I still couldn't tell if he can act.  This movie proves it.  He is great, ranging from sarcastic and brutal to tender and tormented in a moment.

Judi Dench of course is great, even though her role (Mrs. Fairfax) is tiny.

And Jamie Bell is just right as the stiff and callow (and domineering) St. John Rivers.

But best of all are the settings and the writing.  The settings are gorgeous and breathtaking--particularly the outdoor ones, which are always bathed in misty, endless, shimmering colors.  And the writing!  The writer has had the good sense to stick faithfully to Charlotte Bronte's original, and lift whole passages directly.  This works beautifully.

The camera work is lovely, ranging from jittery and hand-held in Jane's moments of torment to swooping and glowing in the indoor scenes to epic and stunning in the outdoor ones.

Granted, there is one peculiarity.  Instead of going chronologically, as the book does, this production starts with Jane's horrifying trek across the rain-sodden and barren moors, penniless, friendless, lost, starving, just after leaving Thornfield (Rochester's house).  She nearly dies, and is rescued on the doorstep by St. John Rivers and his two sisters.  Only then are there flashbacks to explain her past--her childhood, her time with Rochester, the catastrophic wedding.

This might be confusing for someone unfamiliar with the story, but it makes emotional sense.  It starts at the time of greatest emotional intensity, then goes back to explain.

Even those unfamiliar will soon get it.

All in all, a splendid production.",1341619200,2,2057,5.201219512195122

I know I sound like a total girl but Mr. Rochester was gorgeous and I think the actress who played Jane was perfect.

4490719,2,B004X181TY,"Like other reviewers, I love the Jane Eyre novel and agree with them in saying this film does not do the book justice; I expected that when i viewed the film, but was still hoping to get some enjoyment of it, however was sadly disappointed. Also alot of things are different from the real story.
I anticipate for someone who does not know the story and descriptive emotions between the characters this movie will be quite confusing since it begins at the middle of the book then jump to Jane being a child and back and forth, without including much of what originally was going on in her life. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are so few and cut short that there isn't very much to see regarding the development of there love, the ending where Jane returns to the blind Mr. Rochester was also the worst, viewers will be left waiting for more but will sadly only see the credits. So disappointing...since i think it had potential to be a very good updated version.",1339804800,2,972,4.497175141242938

It is like a painting that became alive.  I will not analyze it to threads...it is to  be experienced.

Let the director Cary F. and the superb actors Mia W. and of course, Michael F. And Jamie B. et. al. embody the lives of such characters  that interacted  over 100 years ago.

4490721,3,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre,the new film by Fukunaga,is an attempt to take a well-worn subject by an outsider new film-maker, shows a film faithful to its source material,while Buffini's screenplay introduces flashbacks to avoid the straightjacket of chronology-the film opens dramatically with Jane(Wasikowska) stumbling across the moors in distress,she's fleeing from Thornfield Hall,from the gothic mansion full of Rochester's(Fassbender)secrets and her wedding to Rochester,which has been disrupted by her knowledge of his mad wife. The film hinges on Wasikowska's excellent Jane,the plain governess,with her mix of purity,independence,defiance and lonely yearning. Her scenes with Fassbinder are repletewith witty repartee, honesty,and understated repressed passion. There is an edge to their scenes together:""Your gaze is very direct Miss Eyre. Do you think me handsome?""-he taunts.

After the opening introduction to St. John Rivers and his sisters we go back through a tale of sorry woe to her childhood. Sally Hawkins plays Jane's aunt with a Dickensian cruelty. Lowood,the charity school where she is bullied by sadistic teachers. She later becomes a teacher there. She becomes a paid subordinate in Thornfield. She first meets him by frightening his horse and he gets thrown and injured. She gets to know him through the kindly but fussy Miss Fairfax(Dench).Jane and Rochester become friends and she rescues him when fire breaks out in the house. The gothic nature of the house is highlighted by the candlelight,the oil lamps,the fire in the grate, pushing against the surrounding darkness,as well as the tales of secret people walking about,of hidden knocks, bangs,footsteps,laughter,cries. There is less light in this period movie.

Jane's compelling directness and otherworldliness galvanise Rochester's jaded Byronism. The film's virtue is a straightforward sincerity,a quietness of style and mood suited to austere times. The style is neo-realism,a pared-down costuming,chilly natural light,slate-and-earth colour palette,precise cinematography,and the use of period language,intonation and dialect. There is a referencing of the spiritual and supernatural,the distancing sense of the `past as a foreign country'.Marinelli's classical score has a Romantic impulse between humanfigure and engulfing landscapes. The movement of the story is from Jane's ""poor,obscure"" selfhood and self-possession to equality with the older Rochester. We are immersed in a mythic,timeless narrative world:""I imagine things I am powerless to execute""in an ""invisible kingdom of spirits"".The darker elements of the novel,centred around Bertha Mason,her madness,the colonial Caribbean backdrop,Rochester's brooding intensity,are largely left out. Fassbinder is the actor de nos jours,but he lacks the depth of previous incarnations,Welles,Dalton and Hurt. A striking directorial achievement nevertheless,renewing the appeal of a timeless classic.",1337558400,2,2922,6.089805825242719
4490722,5,B004X181TY,"I must confess that I bought the book 11 years ago, but it sat on my shelf or packed in a box for the whole time; that is, until I watched this version.  It may be 500+ pages, but I highly recommend taking the time to read it!

(If you're interested in a semi-biographical summary of Charlotte and her family's life, you might want check out the BBC docu-drama ""In Search of the Bronts"" - starring Victoria Hamilton as Charlotte.)
_______

  First off, contrary to this movies preview trailers, there really is no added ""preternatural"" elements at least in the movie itself (which truth be told, was what put me off from watching it right away).  Although, 2 of the deleted scenes have it (specifically the extended scene when Jane is leaving Thornfield Manor, and her lengthened wandering on the moors).
...If that's what you're looking for, you'll be sure to find it in ""Wuthering Heights"" by Emily Bront.

**Semi-Spoiler**: The movie starts off at chapter 28 in the book.  Which may be a bit confusing to those unfamiliar with the story.  (To reiterate what another reviewer stated, the script writer's (Moira Buffini) interpretation of why she chose to write the story the way she did-- was so the viewer could be pulled into Jane's story right away.)
____

Ideally, it would have been nice if they gave at least 20+ minutes more time to showcase the deeper conversations that Rochester & Jane had, and to prove that it was more than a sudden infatuation that spurred the proceeding relationship (despite their 20 year age difference).
..I'm really hoping for a ""directors cut"" to be released in the future!  (In the meantime, I'm really tempted to try my hand at video editing, and insert a few of the significant deleted scenes, and re-burn it to disc.)

As noted earlier, the novel is some 500/600+ pages, so really only a miniseries could do it proper justice.

However, as a stand alone (2 hour) m-o-v-i-e, all that could be condensed into that time frame without seeming too disjointed, or confusing- was.  In my opinion, it captured the essence of the story quite well!

I particularly enjoyed the scenery, costumes, cinematography, musical score.  And last but not least, the cast- especially the leads: Michael Fassbender, & Mia Wasikowska, whose portrayals resonated with me more than most (if not all) of the previous I've seen.  Dame Judi Dench is my favorite Mrs. Fairfax to date!
_____
Just a quick mention... There's a lot of interesting interviews on YT with the director, and cast.  I just finished watching one called ""Q&A with Director Cary Fukunaga and Actress Mia Wasikowska Interview Part 1"" filmed March 1, 2011 in front of a live audience (pt. 2 being a Q&A with the audience themselves).  If you fast-forward to 5:10 you'll hear his take on how he approached the film.
_____

Because of the time constraint, here are some of the more notable omissions/changes  (**SPOILER ALERT**):

- Grace Poole (Bertha's nurse).  She was given about 1 minute screen time. In the book she was mentioned, and seen by Jane (as well has had a conversation with) before the whole revelation.
- Various extended conversations between Rochester & Jane (namely the proposal, before Jane's leaving Thornfield, and their reunion at the end).
- They should have kept one or two of the ""deleted scenes"" (included on the disc).  Specifically the (Jane/Rochester) ""Badminton in the Garden"" conversation; and if not the whole veil ripping scene, at least the part where Jane's recounts it to Rochester, and his response.
- The Rochester ""Gypsy"" scene was missing (Rochester's attempt at ascertaining Jane's true feelings towards him).
I realize this is probably a difficult scene-- likely one that would require multiple re-takes because I can imagine it would be hard for the leads to keep a straight face during it.
Both Michael Jayston ('73), and Timothy Dalton ('83) managed to pull it off, but it would have been interesting to see another attempt (even if it ended up as a bonus ""deleted scene"").
- Also, it could have been made clear as to who the Rivers siblings were in relation to  Jane (cousins); which was what ultimately prompted her to divide her 20,000 pound (equal to 1.7 million pounds, or $14.0 million USD in today's value) inheritance equally between herself and the 3 of them.
- The tweaked ending (Mrs. Fairfax moved away after the fire; book ending location: Ferndean manor -neither of which are major issues, but worth a mention.  Also, Rochester not only lost his sight, but he also lost a hand and an eye in the fire- which only the '83 has yet to faithfully show), and again- REALLY shortened dialogue.
_______
If you're not willing to read the whole book, I recommend the following chapters (which can be found online for free):
- 14 (Second Rochester/Jane conversation--Insight into their characters nature)
- 15 (Rochester's Celine Varens revelation; the fire)
- 19 (Rochester as the old Gypsy lady)
- 20 (Mason attacked; Sunrise garden conversation)
- 23 (Proposal)
- 27 (Jane/Rochester conversation before she leaves Thornfield)
- 37 & 38 (Jane's return, and reconciliation with Rochester)
______

In conclusion, if you're entirely new to this story, please get acquainted with the book before or after viewing!  If you're not a fan of reading (or listening to an audio book), and you'd rather watch an adaptation- look into the 1973 or 1983 BBC miniseries for an absolute faithful retelling.
There is another newer miniseries (2006/07), but for me, the only real advantage it has compared to the '73 & '83 renditions, is that it has the modern cinematic feel/experience (meaning the acting & sets aren't as stiff and theatrical).  On the downside it's pretty flawed in it's interpretation: lines ""dumbed down"", and certain events unfaithfully re-written.  The end result is borderline soap-opera; so for that reason I can only rate it 2 1/2 stars.",1337126400,3,5880,4.898185483870968
4490723,4,B004X181TY,"To start out, I have never read Jane Eyre. I will be reading it soon, but just haven't gotten around to it. I've seen other adaptations of the movie before this one and I have to say... I fell more in love with the story watching this version than any other.

So what if not all of the dialogue is presented, or this or that isn't accurate. When I watch a movie, I take it for what it is: a movie. It's not a book. It's not the classic so many of you have fallen in love with years and years prior to this movie. I think sometimes you set yourself up for disappointment when you go into an adaptation expecting perfection. Here's the bottom line: You will never find a movie that does perfect justice to classic novel such as Jane Eyre.

Now, as far as the technical stuff goes:
Great soundtrack. Great locations and set designs. Great cinematography. Great cast.

As far as the storyline goes (purely from a movie standpoint):
Having never read the book, I understood perfectly what was happening in the story.
I found remarkable chemistry between the actors. The last scene (while abrupt) was spectacularly done, leaving me staring blankly, with goosebumps edging down my arms, as the credits rolled.
I think the script was passionate, witty, and charming. All the things I would expect from a classic novel.

Overall, I feel like this film has captured a certain spirit. A spirit I am sure captures the subtle romance happening and soon exploding onto the pages of Jane Eyre. It's not about the details, it's about the feeling.",1336608000,,1530,4.572992700729927
4490724,4,B004X181TY,"Okay, okay I will freely confess that as a boy I did not, I steadfastly did not, read a girls' book, Charlotte Bronte's  Jane Eyre. And I did not, as we live a confessional age, read her sisters' books or even, damned to hell, Jane Austen's stuff. And you would not have either (or at least not have said so publicly) any place near my corner boys society growing up absurd in the 1950s old North Adamsville neighborhood. See you either didn't read, and made a big virtues out of it preferring chasing cars and girls, or for those like my corner boy, Frankie Larkin, and me, who did we read mad Jack Keroauc, or besotted Scott Fitzgerald, or best of all, the max daddy mad adventurer Ernest Hemingway. Period.

Moreover if we didn't read guy novelists then we were crazy (and make that I was crazy) for history books. But not girls' books, no way. Which is a shame in a way because the trials and tribulations of Jane Eyre (and other female characters created by 19th European women writers, and not just women writers either, like the aforementioned Jane Austen) related experiences of class, race and social oppression (intertwined with a little off-hand romance to sell books then, and now, to the female reading public) that resonate with this writer today.

So it is something of a gift from the heavens that over the past couple of  decades many of the writers that I did not read, steadfastly did not read in case you forgot, have had their work adapted to the screen. Happily this is true for the film under review. That means that this reviewer gets to, as he has on other occasions, see the story line of the book unfold in order to determine whether he would  decide to read this book after viewing the film.

And the judgment? There is now a high bar for British romances set by Ms. Austen, most notably with her Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darby in Pride and Prejudice in the matter of 19th century sensibility. While that standard was not surpassed in this film Ms. Bronte (and the actors here) did give a very decent sense of the oddball (to our eyes), anti-democratic and socially savage way that women, women of no means (or no known means), were shunted off in the backwoods of society.

But spunk is a value we can all appreciate and to use a more modern phrase than would be proper in jolly old England back in the day to describe the evolving plot line- a girl has got ot do what a girl has got to do. On that level  this thing is a classic girl (okay woman, Ms. Eyre) meets boy (okay man, Mr. Rochester) story. And, lo and behold, the girl is actually ten times stronger than the boy. And, frankly, twenty times more interesting.  Maybe that is why I, steadfastly, did not read Jane Eyre and the others then.  But will now.",1336521600,2,2748,4.4453280318091455
4490725,2,B004X181TY,"I'm an avid Jane Eyre fan, and I was excited about watching this movie. But from the very start, I was disappointed, and disappointed that I had to be disappointed!

Nothing seemed developed at all. Unless you knew the story before-hand, it would be very difficult to understand what was going on, and the depth behind it. The actresses's portrayal of Jane was the weakest I've seen - where's Jane's quick wit and spunk? Her evening conversations with Mr. Rochester were boiled down to 2 minutes of strained, flat pry-it-out-of-her conversation, instead of the spunky, bluntly honest conversations from the book. Her quietness was over emphasized, leaving her with NO depth, no emotion, no character. The only time you see her ""falling in love"" is of her twirling a flower in her hand, bringing the depth of her emotions down to that of a school-girl crush. There is actually very little interaction between her and Mr. Rochester, and the parts that are there show absolutely no chemistry. Rochester's actor was way too nice! Bronte meant him to be harsh, bitter, darkened, manipulative, haunted by demons of his past, yet able to flash the hand of kindness and emotions. All we see here is brief glimpses of a happy, smiling, contented-looking man. The line in the movie when Jane returns to Thornfield after burying her aunt, and Mr. Rochester says ""Jane Eyre with nothing to say?"" This line amazed me - because all throughout the movie, Jane has said VERY LITTLE, bringing this sentence (although a true statement when held up to the Jane from the book) to having no barring or connection with the story at all.

It was impossible to engage with the depth of both of their emotions after the wedding - it made no sense for them to be in such passions of emotions over not being together, when they had barely had any time together, and definitley none that even hinted at such a soul-connection between them. I found myself repeated almost wanting to laugh, as I heard lines that sounded right in the book being used in the movie, but not making sense because of the lack of portrayal of their emotional connection. There is no ""string attached"" to their hearts.

4490730,5,B004X181TY,"My favorite adaptation of Jane Eyre is the Orson Welles version. All subsequent versions have a lot to answer for, so I make a few comparisons between previous versions.

Pros:  The casting of this film was a major selling point for me.  Though Jane was not quite as fleshed out as I would've liked, I didn't mind so much given how taken I was by Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  True, Michael Fassbender is far more handsome than any Rochester should be, but I think he was just tortured and arrogant enough to pull it off.  The scene in which he puts his hands upon Jane and describes here as a mere reed in his hands was pay-dirt for all of us romantic-drama junkies.  That scene alone was worth the price of admission.  Fassbender had all of the intensity and wounded soul interest that William Hurt couldn't pull off in a previous version of the film.  There was a lot more implied ""heat"" between Jane and Rochester that I really enjoyed as something different from other films.  It took some liberties, I think, but never so much that I felt it was untrue to the book.  I think this film did an excellent job depicting Jane's time spent with St. John's family, and gave me a perspective I hadn't had before.

Cons:  The ending sucked.  Period.  Yes, yes, I know how it ends, we all do.  But the ending was abrupt to the point of being absurd.  The William Hurt film had a better ending.  Jane's childhood is the launch pad for getting the viewer (or reader) to get in touch with Jane on a personal level.  I felt that it started out fantastic, but her time spent at school was so rushed and skimmed over it didn't have a chance to develop.  Again, the William Hurt film had a far superior childhood depiction, the Orson Welles version even more so.  T",1335052800,2,1762,4.413043478260869

If I didn't love this version of the movie so much, I would return it based solely on this uninviting cover, hence, the 4 stars. Amazon, you need to review the truth in advertising so more diehards of Jane Eyre are not disappointed this way.",1334534400,,522,4.623655913978495

4490733,2,B004X181TY,"I think what ruined this adaptation for me was Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Mr. Rochester.  My favorite version (although flawed as well) starred Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester and I remember reading a strange review from a major publication that stated he was almost too pretty for the role!  I find that review stranger still when I think of this production!

Fassbender may be all right as a cad in Ozon's Angel and even possibly films with contemporary settings; but his modern spin on Mr. Rochester was very jarring.  Even before I did research on the actor, I kept thinking, ""Oh, he's using physiognomy (certain aspects of which he appears inordinately proud) to create this character.""  But the anatomical parts he kept subtly emphasizing would create a subconscious discord with any almost any modern romantic teenaged heroine let alone a young virginal girl possessing early Victorian mores and outlook.  I kept feeling that Fassbender's modern individual personality was bleeding though the character of Mr. Rochester and I disliked both the character of M. Rochester and the man who played him intensely.  It's a reaction I rarely have when I see a professional production, but time after time I kept sensing the duality of the man who played Rochester.  I was suspended in time watching Mr. Rochester, or was I watching a sell-satisfied man playing Rochester?  The whole point of acting is that you dislike the character but intuitively know it's, well, an act.  For such a major role as Mr. Rochester, this duality destroyed the film.  If you wish to play Casanova, by all means play him.  But play Mr. Rochester as Mr. Rochester.  Jamie Bell's portrayal of St. John Rivers got the whole tension thing right without being too overt. Mia Wasikowska also gave a good performance.  I love Judi Dench, but I thought her acting here was sloppy and not up to her prior fine performances.  Fortunately, she performed a minor role as Mrs. Fairfax and perhaps she thought she was to great of an actress to play such a minor role.

Excellent cinematography, use of sets, costumes, and editing.",1333843200,5,2101,4.926136363636363

4490737,3,B004X181TY,"The latest installment of Jane Eyre does its best to separate itself from the many other film versions, and, while some areas are effective(scenery, mood, atmosphere), there are too many flaws that keep it from being better than average. As it is , it is a mediocre telling of the story, passable and worthy of a viewing, but nothing beyond that.

Told in an unconventional way, this version uses flashbacks as a basis for getting through much of Jane's story, pretty much ditching the ""voice over"" narration. We are taken back to Jane's early upbringing and subsequent arrival at Thornfield, and then fast forward to later portions. While this is a fresh approach to the story, the one negative is simply that it is  harder to get fully invested in the plot's momentum, one minute Jane being a young girl, the next a governess, then back to her as a young girl. The jumpy narrative destroys a little of the novel's power.

Another issue is characterization. For instance, the scene where Jane and Rochester meet could have been handled better. Fleeting moments are scattered throughout that depict Jane and Rochester relationship, but for the most part these are taken on in a superficial fashion, a bit dumbed-down. Rochester, cynical and alienated in other films, comes across as way too sympathetic. Not only that, but where is Rochester in the film's first thirty minutes? There are several scenes that really don't capture the power they could have had, either because they are glossed over artificially or they lack any conviction. Also, this version misses chunks of significant plot essential to forming characters and their motives (such as the relevance of Grace Poole).

I don't want to be overly critical, because it is a decent film. One plus of this version is simply the ambience, the dark feel of the story, especially at Thornfield. A mystery lies within those walls and we can feel that in Jane's exploration of the place. The scenery and ""feel"" of the story is definitely there.

However, this film doesn't have any qualities that make it noteworthy. In the end, I felt it was a lukewarm effort, where you really don't feel too much either way how things turn out. It's difficult to be too invested in any of the characters, either.",1331337600,,2252,4.838961038961039

4490739,1,B004X181TY,"Well, after watching this all I can say is... Thank you, dear Lord, that my mother had the forethought to check it out of the library instead of buying it. This is easily the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre in existence. Here are my complaints-

First (aka 'Dude, where's the cameraman'): if I had to watch one more scene where Mia paced or walked aimlessly in a circle I probably would have screamed.

Second (aka 'The dog ate my script'): They left out key parts of the original Jane Eyre dialogue and added pieces that do not sound in keeping with period. Not that it much mattered since everything was spoken monotone, so as not to wake any of the audience up.

Third (see title): The entire movie felt like the cliff notes version of Jane Eyre. For all the length of the movie (and believe me, it was endless), it felt like there was no pause between Jane's ""Hello I'm the governess"" and Mr. Rochester's ""Hey babe let's get married."", leaving anyone who had never read the book before to believe that Jane is only after him for his money and Mr. Rochester must be desperate. Honestly, the only thing that could have saved this movie from itself was if Mrs. Rochester really did turn into a vampire and killed them all.",1330992000,4,1221,4.466367713004484

As I was watching the movie my eyes would glance at the clock and wonder how they were going to fit all the needed scenes into this movie.  You can not see a Jane Eyre movie in 2 hours. That being said I believe the chemistry between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester was the best out of the previous versions. After the burning bed seen I could not wait to see more of that chemistry.

It was not to be seen the movie went by so fast that useless you had seen previous versions you would have been lost as to what was happening. Let's cross our fingers maybe there is a longer version.

4490741,3,B004X181TY,"I've been a Jane Eyre fanatic ever since I fell head over heels with Mr. Rochester in the seventh grade and I was very much looking forward to seeing this version which I had high hopes for.  Alas, this Jane Eyre suffers very much from the same problem that bedeviled the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice: there is simply no way to tell the story coherently in two hours.  And starting the film with Jane running away from Thornfield and then flashing back to the events that brought her there simply confused the plot.

The film is like a disjointed sequence of scenes following each other because so many scenes were omitted from the book to make the movie fit into its time frame.  There is little time for character development and less for plot development.  Visually the movie is beautiful, the cinematography is outstanding, but there just isn't enough movie to do justice to the story.  And of all the people to delete from the film version, they should never have omitted Grace Poole, the taciturn keeper of the mad Mrs. Rochester who is a small but absolutely central character in the book.

Mia Wasikowska (I was tempted to copy another reviewer and call her Mia Whatchamacallit but I did take the trouble to look up her name) is an excellent Jane, showing much of the charm and naivete she exhibited in Alice in Wonderland.  And she looks just right for the part, very young and pale and somewhat plain and mousy.  Judi Dench is a charming and likable Mrs. Fairfax.  The rest of the cast is also very good, although I wouldn't say outstanding, with the glaring exception of Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  Fassbender simply is not Rochester.  I found him just lukewarm instead of displaying the brooding passion that made Orson Welles and Timothy Dalton so memorable in that role.

Overall, it's not a bad version of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, but it's a fair-to-middling movie of one of the greatest novels in English literature.  Go for the Dalton movie; it's still the best one out there.

4490742,4,B004X181TY,"I am giving this one four stars simply because it entertained me, the scenery and props were great and I am rather fond of this particular story.  This is of course the most recent remake of the wonderful Bronte classic.  I am not sure how many shootings of this film have been made over the years but it is probably one of the most done and done again stories available. As I said, I am not sure how many of them there are but I do know, due to my wife, that I have seen them all down through the years.  There are many reasons for this of course but there are great pitfalls for the producers, directors and actors.

The first of course is that viewers will be constantly comparing it to the last remake or the original.  There have been some splendid versions of this movie already made and lets face it, they are tough acts to follow.  If you read the reviews here you will find there are a lot of unhappy movie watchers due to this remake thing.

Second, there are Bronte purists...a hardcore bunch of folks who show no quarter in their distain for anything that slightly deviates from the original novel.  I know how they feel.  I am a Tolkien purist and even though the movie, Lord of the Rings was a fine film, I still fussed and whined each and ever time the story line was not the one I had in my head after reading the books (many times).

This particular film did leave quite a number of key scenes out from both the book and the previous movies.  I will be honest and tell you that I was not happy about this.  On the other hand, had I not seen those other versions or read the book, then I would have thought this film to be just fine and dandy.  There is also the actors.  While I applauded the fact that the makers used Mia Wasikowska in the staring role, I was not all that happy with Michael Rassbender.  Mia is not a raving beauty...I love her looks and find them fascinating but lets face it, she could be considered by many to be just a bit on the plan side.  This was how the original book character was.  As to Michael - I like his acting but for the life of me I simply could not place him in this role in my mind.  He simply is not ruthless and hard looking like the character of the book. I felt at times there could have been a bit more passion displayed between the leading lady and man.  But hey, this is just me.  Obviously and rightly there are other opinions as to the casting.

I was not happy with the tinkering of scenes and events that took place and have to admit to having been thrown off until I picked up the rhythm of the movie.

But overall, I simply blocked from my mind (what little of that there is) past versions of this book and indeed, the book itself, and simply tried to enjoy the movie as a stand-alone.  I was entertained and to be quite frank, that is really the only reason I bother watching movies for.

I debated between the four star rating and a three star rating and decided to give it the benefit of a doubt.  This is one of those movies I wish I did not have to give a star rating to as it is the sort that you will either love or hat it....each will have to make their own mind up on that count.

The quality of the DVD was quite good and I encountered no problems.

Why have her start out at the rochester mansion and recall her life as a child and at the lowwood school. It was changed to much to like it. I wish i never bought it.

4490744,5,B004X181TY,"This movie does Charlotte Bronte proud. Too many period movies put an actor or actress in the lead role who are very good-looking when the part calls for a plain person. Mia Wasikowska, though interesting-looking, is not by any means gorgeous. I think she's the perfect Jane. Her acting ability is fantastic. While trying to hold on to her reserve, you can see the emotions just under the surface.
Michael Fassbender may be a tad too handsome, but his acting is believable.
Beautiful cinemetography.

4490745,3,B004X181TY,"If viewers are looking for a shorter film version of Bronte's classic, then this adaptation is a good one. It comes in around 120 minutes. The settings and costumes are wonderful. A few of the scenes go deeper, darker, than previous film versions and I liked that.

Unfortunately, Jane Eyre is not the type of story you should experience in an abridged manner.

** Slight spoiler alert **

There are many, many things that should not be missed. Some of the items deleted from this movie were - Grace Poole, key lines and interactions between Mr. Rochester and Jane, the gypsy scene, and St. John's love interest, Rosamund.

The acting was also a little awkward. The tender scenes between the two love birds left me feeling uncomfortable and hoping for a second take. Also - Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender do not fit the description of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Key elements of the classic story are Jane's slightly homily face and Rochester's savage looks. The two actors picked were far too pleasant to fall into either of these categories.

I found this movie very boring and even though I'm a huge fan of the book, I don't mind loose versions, but this one is too incomplete, missing important parts and characters of the book, so why to name the film ""Jane Eyre""?. In my opinion the main problem is the lack of chemistry between Mia and Michael. I saw this DVD three times to see if I was wrong, but still, you don't feel the chemistry of the two main characters and without that, there is not Jane Eyre. If you want a good version, with actors that make you feel like you are really leaving the story and that they care deeply about each other then buy the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. To me that is the best version.",1329177600,9,836,4.3312101910828025
4490747,3,B004X181TY,"Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

This version of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel is intriguing, to say the least. The technique of telling most of the story as a flashback is a bold move, but honestly, I found it to be distracting. The score by Dario Marianelli (Pride And Prejudice) is excellent, and there are some good moments between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Unless you know the story very well (and I've read the novel several times, the last one being around six months before this version came out, so I do know the story very well), you will find yourself asking, ""What exactly is going on here?"" Plus, there are a lot of moments from the novel which are cut out from this adaptation that are present in other film versions, notably the 1983 version starring Timothy Dalton (which is my personal favourite). For instance, Adele's backstory is merely hinted at, and Mr. Rochester's climactic scene with Jane is nowhere near as dramatic as in the 1983 version. Plus, I found Ms. W.'s Austrailian accent very distracting (Jane Eyre is English, according to the book). I recommend this movie for only people who know the story very well; otherwise, you'll probably think that the original novel is boring and thereby close yourself off to some of the greatest literature ever written. This version should have been rated PG.",1329177600,2,1348,4.785407725321888

In a perfect world this version would have been longer and more elements of the book would have been incorporated into the movie (such as Bertha tearing Jane's veil), but considering the time restraint of a movie like this I believe this adaption has captured much of the eeriness and passion that others fail to. Fassbender is my favorite Mr. Rochester by far. He portrays him with such an intellectual intensity, just as he is in the book. I highly recommend this adaption to anyone who doesn't expect a movie to capture Charlotte Bronte's masterwork verbatim, but that is able to communicate the sense and emotion of the story in a limited amount of time.",1328486400,3,726,4.724409448818897

I thought Mia W. had the right look for Jane, but her performance was a bit boring to me. I know that Jane is meant to be plain and quiet, but I just didn't sense her inner strength, and in the first proposal scene, she seemed more annoyed than passionate.

Lastly, I HATED the ending. No Ferndean? No bringing of a tray, and the touching of hands? And what was with that crazy beard that Rochester was sporting? Worst of all, they just ended it with a kiss, and then, fade to black. Couldn't they have added ten more minutes and put the second proposal in?

4490753,1,B004X181TY,"The story of Jane Eyre is well known - a poor, mistreated young woman falls for the guardian of the young girl to whom she is governess, but their romance is overshadowed by a dark secret from his past.
But a more lifeless rendition of this film I could not imagine. The actress who plays Jane Eyre expresses as much emotion as an icicle - and a very bored one at that -- while the actor who plays Rochester is as lively as a long buried corpse.  It seems as if the creators of this film, in fearing to go overboard with emotions, decided the best approach was to make a film utterly devoid of it all - except at the very, very beginning.
In the introduction scenes, we see crying...and whimpering...and crying...and whimpering. Then we switch to zombie mode. No one feels anything. Brocklehurst is perhaps one of the most passionate early characters, and he comes across as bored at best. Rochester and Eyre's interactions lack any spark; they are zombies reciting words in plain and flat tones. Jane Eyre's expressions rarely change. She has no kindness or warmth for Adele; indeed, one must pity the poor child who has to put up with such frigid indifference from both governess and guardian. After we meet Mrs. Fairfax, we find another character who doesn't quite look like she has passed into the spirit world yet - but only just. And Jane and Rochester continue to plod, disinterestedly, through the story, ruining every witty exchange, every moment of sadness or joy, with their languid and tepid acting.
One of my ""favorite"" scenes in this horror is the ""this is my spirit addressing your spirit"" exchange. Could a blander and less interesting spirit possibly exist? Here, at least, Jane manages to tilt her eyebrows upward to indicate some emotion, though her tone remains as frigid as ever. I suppose that counts for something.
Another is the ""Forgive me. I'm worthless. How could I?""  line, after Jane finds out that Rochester is already married. Imagine someone saying, ""I was going to pick up skim milk, but they were out, so I got one percent instead."" That's about the amount of emotion Rochester put into this. Maybe that's too generous. And no, I am not exaggerating. Preschoolers past their nap time could have done a better and more convincing job than these lifeless hacks.
There is a perhaps five minute or so window of time when the characters seem to awaken from death in order to show a bit of liveliness, and this is the space of time between the wooden proposal and the ridiculous revelation scenes. Never fear, undead lovers: they promptly fall back into their old habits. Or, perhaps, I am too cruel to the undead. This is so lifeless, it is somewhat akin to a zombie portraying a zombie portraying a zombie...portraying a zombie.
The Jane Eyre story is a great one, and the screenplay for this version isn't bad. It's the acting, though, that puts the nails in the coffin of this film's potential. If you want to see how truly atrocious a film can be while doing a fairly decent job with setting, scenery, filmography or screenplay, this is highly recommended. Likewise, if you have two hours of time to waste, or you'd like a visual aid to induce naps, try this. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and skip this masterpiece of tedium, in all its excesses of boredom.",1327190400,16,3292,4.674137931034482

4490755,1,B004X181TY,"Cary Fukunaga's 2011 ""Jane Eyre"" is a boring, dreary, monochromatic, misconceived botch. Fukunaga doesn't know who Charlotte Bronte is, but he sure knows his Igmar Bergman. He takes a wild, beloved and accessible book about a vibrantly alive girl and turns it into a pointlessly morose, dry and impenetrable film class experiment. One must ask: why was this film even made? There are so many adaptations of ""Jane Eyre"" out there, including a zombie version - made before the current zombie trend. Who felt a pressing need for a sotto-voce, mud-colored, depressive and anemic ""Jane Eyre"" without adequate lighting?

From the first scenes, watching this movie was tooth-grinding torture. Fukunaga's decision to make the film without lighting was a mistake. A dull, gray palette does not equate great art. If nothing else, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most colorful books ever written: there are physical fights, screaming mad women, burning castles, calculating belles, tortured and dying orphans, the reunion of long-lost relatives and long-lost lovers, psychic communication, murder attempts, big dogs, and fetching French dancing girls. There are profoundly poignant relationships, not just between Jane and Rochester, but between Jane and Bessie, a servant in her aunt's home, Jane and Helen Burns, a fellow orphan, and Jane and her student, Adele. You really can't film all that in an unlit, dun-colored setting with near-catatonic performances and expect to do it any justice at all. You are just torturing your material for no good reason, trying to turn ""Jane Eyre"" into something it is not.

Also, ""Jane Eyre"" is a *gothic* novel. Gothic tales are supposed to be presented in a manner that is creepy, hair-raising, and over-the-top. There are scenes in ""Jane Eyre"" that cry out for expressionist lighting and ominous music - like in the 1944, Orson Welles / Joan Fontain version which, if nothing else, captured Jane's early years as an impoverished orphan, and the gothic atmosphere, very well.

Jane Eyre, the book's eponymous heroine, is the reason to read the book. Scenes of the mistreatment of small children by callous exploiters are bearable because righteous and irrepressible Jane is your guide through all the bleakness, misery, and injustice.

""Jane Eyre"" 2011 attaches leeches to this little firebrand and attempts to bleed her dry. In the opening scenes of the book, the reader immediately knows that this is one spunky heroine who, fist balled and spine stiff in the face of earthly power, will take the reader for a bumpy but unforgettable ride. Jane fights back. Jane demands respect. Jane stands up to everyone, from a cousin who beats her, to a rich aunt who controls her fate, to a sadistic manager of an orphanage, to her ""master"" at her first job. Jane never stops giving lip, standing up, insisting on the worth of one of the most wretched of the earth.

""Jane Eyre"" 2011 opens with Jane sobbing and wandering aimlessly and prostrate on a rock. Why did Cary Fukunaga turn vibrant, feisty, colorful Jane Eyre into this limp, gray, pathetic loser? Was the real Jane of the book too much for him?

There's one good bit in this botch: Michael Fassbender is an excellent Rochester, one of the very best. Enjoying his performance got me through this film. Mia Wasikowska could have made for a very good Jane, but her performance, like the rest of the film, is drained of passion. It's as if Fukunaga instructed his performers to play every scene as quickly and flatly as possible: ""Here you are asking her to marry you. Play it as if you are asking her which subway train goes uptown. And remember - you are distracted, not really present, and in a hurry."" There's no feeling in anything here, and ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most feeling books ever written. It is a deeply passionate book, and this film is as flat as cold as and as dry as the tundra. Tundras have some purpose, though, and I can see none for this film.",1326672000,29,3940,4.881913303437967

4490759,5,B004X181TY,"I have read the book as well as seen the movie, and unlike others who have commented about disliking the differences between the two, I rather enjoyed the changes that were made to the story to bring it to life as a film. Although I am very fond of the book, I think that the story would be too plodding to make a film out of if you stuck too faithfully to the story or included ALL of the ""important lines"". I was saddened to see the '96 adaptation and see how certain lines were 'dumbed down' to make them more understandable to a modern audience. The casting is impeccable and Mia Wasikowska in particular blew me away. Her face is so changeable that even though there may be less dialogue in this adaptation than others before it, you can actually see the thoughts behind her expression and the deliverance of her lines is full of feeling. Some people complain that she is too pretty to play Jane, but I think she was actually perfect because she has a quiet bare faced serenity that at first glance seems plain, but her whit, her voice, and the way she carries herself in the movie really bring to life the beauty that Rochster begins to see in her. She is quite like the Mona Lisa in that she looks like she has a secret world behind her eyes. I think that the acting of all of the cast and the dialogue make the story more real and gets to the heart of the story more effectively than others have. I also loved the ""lost on the moors"" scene and feel that it is much more expressive of Jane's agony of having to tear herself away from Rochester than her just running down a lane and hitching a ride in a passing carriage. The lighting used is just the same as people would really have had back them, candlight, firelight, sunlight. It really added to the authenticity of the film for me in addition to the wonderful costumes. Lastly the score is gorgeous and really reinforces the scenes to the fullest! If you enjoy love stories, this beautifully shot movie is for you!",1325462400,2,1976,4.3432432432432435

I saw this version in the theatre last year, and just re-watched it after receiving it for Christmas. I remember being disappointed then, and now remember why. Without going into detail on the liberties taken, I'll just say, there are WAY too many. Which is so disappointing as the actors may be my favorite of the versions I've seen. I don't think I will ever watch it again. I'll stick with the Masterpiece Theatre version of 2006 in which the actors weren't my favorite (though not bad at all), but the story is the truest to the the original that I've seen.",1325376000,3,715,4.59375

 I found the settings to be very well done - the darkness that comes with gas lighting and small windows left rooms and people only half lit and that has been missed in many other versions. I also found the flash back technique interesting and a good way to tell the story.

However, I thought the dialogue was so stilted and almost non-existent that I couldn't find enough to make me believe that an aristocrat would even notice or become entranced by a plain looking governess. The lack of dialogue also creeped me out because Rochester is in his mid 30's and Jane is 19 - without enough talk to convince me that he had found something of real substance in Jane, I had concerns of borderline pedophelia by Rochester - I mean really, why else would a middle aged man be interested in a homely teenager who only says one or two short sentences at each encounter?

I look forward to the next version because this one just didn't work for me.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B0053Q9DHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>",1325203200,6,1336,4.770562770562771

This is the only adaptation that has ever scared me and made me feel what living at Thornfield with that mad woman must have been like.  I also loved Jane's serenity. She was a model of grace.

However, she wasn't much else. The thing about this romance (and every other) is that it works because of the chemistry, and both these actors were only mild versions of the characters they were portraying. And together, they were just bland. I didn't see why he loved her, or why she loved him, nor was I given any indication of her emotion. It's fine to say that Jane is reserved, but an actress must nonetheless show the audience something or they will be left cold.

Sadly, that was my reaction to the whole movie.  Oh, and I felt it suffered by rearranging the beginning to show bits and pieces across the timeline. It felt like a move by the director to just do something different with this tale that's been told so many times.  Unfortunately, it was a poor choice.

4490767,4,B004X181TY,"I liked the film for the freshness of its interpretation. Mia W. was brilliant in the role of Jane. This version for me highlighted the fact that this is not just a story of hardship and love, but also a subtle tale of revenge...The cruel Aunt dies of a broken heart after seeing her son, her favourite, waste the family's fortune and then kill himself. In order to avoid the fires off hell she must confess to Jane, hated little Jane, that she lied and connived out of spite. The snotty cousins are humiliated.  Even Rochester gets his comeuppance at the end, when he find himself in reduced circumstances, and blind, and she comes back to him rich, and sure of herself. He did  tease and ""test"" poor Jane quite cruelly by exposing her to the charming attentions of Bianca and the other ""ladies"", to feelings of jealousy and  hopelessness  which she could not express ..and  she certainly could not retaliate as she was not their equal in their eyes and in the eyes of society. That she felt herself so, was then a rather revolutionary idea, since people were supposed to accept their place, as God decided.
All through the book ( which I read at least 20 times) the theme of retribution is a thin but visible red thread.. re-read it for yourself and see!!Otherwise, if I was the caster, I would have perhaps chosen Jamie Bell as Rochester, the handsome chappie is far too handsome to be credible, in the book he normally has to pay for his pleasures ( Adle's Mum was not very complimentary about his looks....)",1324425600,,1512,4.544117647058823

4490772,3,B004X181TY,"I have some mixed feelings about this new adaptation of JANE EYRE. I just finished watching the dvd directed by Cary Fukunaga from a screenplay by Moira Buffini. My initial reaction is that this 2011 version started near the ending... Jane lost on the moors...taken in by the Rivers household, St. John and his sisters.  True fans of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel may applaud the novel beginning (we do have our favorite parts, don't we?), but others could be a little lost at the beginning if they didn't know the story well!

The uneven reversal of events is not the only problem I encountered.  I am not a purist when watching this classic on film, but did you see the ""deleted scenes"" feature? Some very good lines and scenes were edited from this production! The happy and explanatory scenes - Adele and Jane playing badminton in the beautiful garden, Blanche Ingram's remarks to Rochester that ""all old houses have a gray lady: I think I just met yours,"" Rochester's explanation to Jane about Adele's circumstance and his pleas for her not to leave after the aborted wedding (really, his shouting ""Jane"" from the window from whence she had just jumped needed a prelude!). Don't you think it was rather badly edited?

I believe the director's stress on the gothic elements both in scene and music was a bit overdone. Jane Eyre is not a horror film but a Gothic romantic thriller...the strange puffs of smoke and mysterious lights and dark and gloomy scenes were too strange, mysterious and dark and gloomy. There is a happy but abrupt ending but one gets used to that in JANE EYRE films. Oscar award-winning Dario Marianetti's score was hauntingly beautiful but very repetitious. It did achieve Fukunaga's idea of gypsy-like fiddler work though. But we were treated to less of Jane Eyre's ""tale of woe"" than I can ever recall. (Perhaps this is a good thing: I was rather amused that one reviewer remarked that this film just ""breezed past the difficult childhood."")

I was very pleased in the principal acting roles. Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fussbender were much better than George C. Scott and Susannah York in the 1970 version. And Fussbender smoldered almost as much as my favorite Rochester, Timothy Dalton in the 1983 BBC production.

And how could I forget the wonderful Judi Dench as Rochester's housekeeper?  A small but stellar performance. Her appearance almost made this a 4 star review!",1323907200,,2408,4.8585365853658535

Now, a couple years later, I see the appeal of a mature and experienced man, and now I can not only commiserate with the unrequited love sentiment, but I am madly in love with this Mr. Rochester. Of course, he looks 28 instead of 40-something, but the movie completely captures the glory of the novel. It's gorgeous, the actors are all lovely (Judy Dench woot!), and you cannot help but love Mia's Jane. A win for 19th centure movie-lovers. Even my dad loved it, and he refuses to admit that he has a heart.

The movie does take a more Gothic tone ... which is to say that all of the outtakes on the DVD are really creepy and kinda disturbing because, in the end, love sells, so the things that were kept were those that would keep the teenage girls coming back rather than the twelve-year-old boys. Wise decision. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was the facial hair.

It's a different place and a different world in 19th Century England. Jane Eyre is an orphan living in an upper class household with her aunt and cousin. Her uncle is her blood relative and he has passed away. There is no love between Jane and her aunt and Jane is sent away to a dismal sort of reform school. She eventually becomes a governess under the employ of a mysterious wealthy employer, Rochester, subject to mood swings. No surprise that they are oddly attracted to each other.

Jane Eyre and Rochester are both portrayed as plain and ordinary in appearance but both have a hidden beauty that is hidden under layers of sadness, loneliness and desire. JANE EYRE is an interesting study in how relationships develop despite major obstances such as class differences.

Judi Dench is always at her best in a period piece. Her role is small but a kind force in Jane Eyre's maturing as she lives a life of independence. The story does seem to move slowly as the mysterious unfold. The cast is great and the scenery and costumes are magnificent.

Mia W excellently portrays through inspired facial expression, body language, and chemistry, the strength and resolve of Jane including all Jane has overcome; in every scene. Michael F is an unusually electric Rochester and brings an energy and charisma often overlooked in the screen experience. In other adaptations I often struggled to identify precisely that thing which made Jane and Rochester click in terms of that kind of chemistry which is undeniable and that they would be powerless to. Mia and Michael have it: their Jane and Rochester convince in a beautifully aching way. Beautiful to look at, hard to ignore, this adaptation would make a worthy gift for a Bronte fan.

I can see why this movie could cause some purists to be unhappy.  There is so much skipped and glossed over.  There are certain scenes from the book that I cannot imagine how they cut them out.

However, I really liked how the movie showed.  The lighting, the atmosphere.  I really thought the flashback method worked.  I thought it was a great way to make a plausible movie in a reasonable time while highlighting key events.  It was a pretty unique and unexpected thing for this book.

I *really* enjoyed the deleted scenes.  Many of them featured Helen Burns, and I wish they had been left in.  When the commentary said that this movie had featured more on the gothic horror part of it than other movies, I think they're right.

The cinematography is incredible, along with the set and costumes.

4490791,5,B004X181TY,"If you are not familiar with, or a fan of, the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte, you may not ""get"" the significance of the story, especially with Cary Fukinangas extremely stark retelling; he uses silence and visuals more than dialouge. I first read the book when I was 10 years old; then, a man like Rochester seemed a romantic ideal. Of course, a few decades later, and some experience with the male of the species under my belt, I have a different take on the whole scenario ;)

For a young man, director Cary Fukinaga captures the true character of Rochester. Or perhaps precisely because he is male, he nailed the exact nature of the beast when he read the book; women tend to want to see the best in men they are attracted to, make excuses, and think the power of their kiss can turn a frog into a prince. This film makes very little excuse for Rochester. One must remember, although the Bronte sisters are the famous ones, they grew up very close to their only brother, a young man who drank, gambled and womanized to excess, and was undoubtedly mentally ill. In the parlance of the times, he became ""disipated"", eventually dying young in a ""fit of madness"", leaving his family with a lot of guilt and unanswered questions about what went wrong. I think in some fashion, Charlotte, who herself had very little experience with men outside her dysfunctional family, tried to save and redeem this brother in her romantic portrayal of Rochester. This film strips off the romance, and leaves nothing but stark reality.

Mia Waskowski made an excellent Jane, her nonverbal communication is excellent, but a little more dialouge would have been nice; if you have not read the book, you may wonder what makes Jane so special, and why she is crazy for Rochester in the first place. In the book, the intellectual banter between the two sealed the deal, but here, you are left wondering, other than the fact that Jane has very few options in regards to ""dating"", why she would fall so hard for a selfish, secretive, cynical man like Rochester. I also must commend Judy Densch on her portrayal of Mrs. Fairfax; protective of Jane, with a wisdom she really can't express. She's a woman who has had to make the best of her ""place"" in life.

Cary Fukanaga also properly captured the occult and metaphysical overtones of the book; the ""demon in the attic"", as metaphor for what haunts Rochester. Married off for money, Rochester's wife turned out to be a mentally ill woman of low moral character (oddly, just like Charlotte Bronte's real life brother) But, rather than sending her away to a mental institution, he secretly locks her away in the attic of his house. The scene in the attic was quite telling; Rochester tenderly embraces the ""succubus"", exclaiming, ""my old demon"", and allows her to triumphantly spit on the virginal Jane. In another scene, Rochester takes hold of Jane, proclaiming he wants what she has locked safely inside herself; her Soul. Why? Because Jane's unsullied Soul would ""regenerate him with a vengence"". Is Rochester really capable of Love? Or has he himself become a sort of ""incubus"", a ""demon"" in search of a Soul? Jane was quite right to run away as fast as she could! Too bad she went back; IMHO, she should have kept all of her inheritance, and kept running!",1320624000,15,3287,4.6833910034602075
4490792,5,B004X181TY,I love the Jane Austin movies and this one was different for the other Jane Eyre movies out.

It showed he had a really down to earth side as he worked a long side his employees. I believe it was very well done.,1320364800,,380,4.148648648648648
4490793,3,B004X181TY,"I've read Jane Eyre several times, and seen at LEAST four or five versions; I still think--hands down--that the miniseries starring Timothy Dalton is the best.  I think it must be remembered that Charlotte Bronte herself was a person of deep, passionate feeling (and, in fact, did not marry until a man of equal demonstrative passion laid his heart at her feet) and I can't help but feel that the producers of this version were more interested in an understated, romantic 'look' rather than conveying any strong depth of emotion.  The acting is certainly not terrible; it is simply not memorable, in my opinion.  On the plus side, the outdoor scenery is spectacular, and the musical score is marvelous.  It still beats watching modern films (most of which are completely forgettable) and I'm not sure if the problem is in the casting/acting, or more the fault of the director/producer.  Perhaps more intense closeups, stronger, clearer dialogue--in general, a more forceful production--may have made the film memorable.  In short, I found the whole film pretty to look at and rather blah.  But then, one of my favorite films is ""True Grit"" with John Wayne, so maybe the film is just fine, and the problem lies with ME, lol.

If you are full-blooded, passionate person with a lot of heart, strong-willed and decisive, then you'll probably be disappointed by this film.  If you're a hopeless romantic that sips tea in the afternoon just because Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte did the same, then you'll like it just fine :D",1320019200,2,1522,4.891050583657588
4490794,5,B004X181TY,"Perfectly made adaptation of one of the most popular classics ever. The director/screenwriter made the right choices in eliminating the big distractions--the kindly head mistress who can't really help and the coincidence of finding that Jane is related to her saviors, the Rivers, with whom she shares her inheritance.  The northern Yorkshire accents also add to the charm. I watched it three times and it was the second time that I realized how much I like it.  I was too busy trying to keep up with the dialog to hear the beautiful music and enjoy the characters.  By the third time I'm in heaven.  I've been doing some reading about Charlotte Bronte and one of the greatest love stories is her marriage to Arthur Nichols.  I'm looking forward to reading the book ""Mr. Charlotte Bronte.""  Another plus in the movie is the intricate dialog straight from the book.

I'm always up to check out a new adaptation of a favorite, and see how it compares: this 'Jane Eyre' does not disappoint!

The acting is superbly done, the costumes are good, the cinematography is well-done - I was touched by the lovely, emotional and heartfelt scenes, and fell in love with the characters all over again.  It's hard to pick a favorite 'Jane Eyre' myself, as there are merits from each of the ones that I own: a particular touching scene, a re-interpretation of the language of the novel, a filming location or style of presentation...I found enough different and enough the same in this new version, to appreciate it deeply for its own merits, while still adoring the great works of other 'Jane Eyre' films done in the past: such great parts played by Timothy Dalton, Ciaran Hinds, Toby Stephens, etc.",1319241600,4,1158,4.78

Some people liked it better then the miniseries with Timothy Dalton who is my favorite as ""Rochester"". I sat down in anticipation for a viewing. On many levels I was disappointed.

The scenery, music and costumes were breathtaking. They were like a beautiful Victorian painting. That in my book is a well deserved 5 stars, unfortunately for me the rest fell flat. Mia Wasikowska did a fair job with the screenplay she had to work with. I felt Michael Fassbender was very dispassionate in his portrayal of Rochester, he gave him no depth. The only other portrayal of Rochester I've seen worse then his was William Hurt's. Judi Dench was stellar as always.

I realize it's very difficult to cover all of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel in a 2 hour movie but I feel others have done a much better job of doing this.

4490800,4,B004X181TY,"By my count, Charlotte Bront's classic novel about titular governess Jane Eyre has been filmed at least six times - including a spectacular Italian TV movie directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1996 and a noirish black and white 1943 film starring Orson Welles (with rumors of his hand behind the camera).

The painterly cinematography in the latest version perfectly matches the controlled but passionate performances of Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbinder who circle each other seemingly trapped in a world of missed opportunities hidden by the hand of fate.  But suppressed emotions and dark secrets will be confronted and conquered because, as we all know, true love always wins in the end.

wonder if Bront would approve of director Cary Fukunaga's masterful, rather faithful version that captures the sense of time and place of her beloved novel.  I think perhaps she might like this movie above all other filmic incarnations.  But I'd still like to see a version with Rochester as a vampire and the monster locked away in Thornfield as the seductive creature that infected him - and feeds off him in a secret frenzy of mutual lust and addiction.

4490801,5,B004X181TY,"There have been numerous comments about the parts of the book omitted from this version.  I haven't read the book in many years and still felt an emotional reaction remembering the omitted sections of the novel (Lowood in particular.)

I think that Mia Wasikowska should win a ton of awards for her performance. She beautifully communicates the underlying fierceness and fundamental self-respect Jane has as well as intense feeling/passion with limited dialog and physical action. The effect is an emotional tension in the character like the vibration of a single violin string.  Of course, this is amplified by the score.

I love the romantic versions of Jane Eyre but I loved this one for different reasons.

Although a gothic romance, the novel is a 19th century one and the film's characters are true to this.  Rochester is not quite so Byronic.
The cinematography brings the isolation and loneliness of Jane (and Rochester) to the fore.  The lighting is also true to the 19th century as well as adding a gothic touch.

But most of all this version is about passion rather than romantic love -- the passion that can only develop between two equals.

Makes you wonder what Charlotte Bronte's life would have been if she hadn't spent her life in a freezing parsonage in Haworth watching her sisters die of tuberculosis and her brother drink himself to death.",1319068800,,1360,4.903930131004367

4490803,1,B004X181TY,"This is the worst version of Jane Eyre I've seen. I've been watching every version that I could get my hands on since I was little and I've loved them all in their own way. I was thrilled to watch a new interpretation of Jane Eyre with my Mom (who loves the story as much as I do) but we ended up turning it off about half way into the film. There was no emotion in the characters. Rochester and Jane might as well have been reciting grocery lists they were so blank and deadpan. When Jane asks Rochester if he thinks she is a ""machine"" during the infamous proposal scene, all I could think was ""YES!"" After letting that awful movie stew in my mind for a day or two, I decided to go online and watch the rest to see if I was just in a bad mood during my first watch. Unfortunately, it only got worse! The ending was terrible - just as devoid of emotion as the first half. How could the exact same story that I've seen played out time and again, that always left me sobbing in happiness, leave me completely disgusted, annoyed and angry at myself for throwing away my time? What a waste of my $1 in the Redbox. Such a disappointment.",1318896000,15,1132,4.15
4490804,5,B004X181TY,"I didn't think it possible to do justice to this book in a two-hour flick.  I almost didn't watch it, because the last attempt was so deplorable (from 1996).  This turned out to be my favorite of them all, surpassing even the 1983 miniseries with Timothy Dalton.  This version of my all-time favorite book is beautifully, masterfully done.  The second time through, I had my husband watch--a guy who can't stay awake for a 40-minute TV show without commercials.  He was transfixed the entire time, never got up (never happens), and when it was done, said, ""That was a great movie!""

This new version is unusual in that it isn't linear.  It starts in the middle of the book, and most of the story is told in flashbacks.  This made it more interesting, and they were able to accomplish more in less time.  The story never felt rushed.  While you can't include all of a 500-page book in any movie or miniseries, they were quite faithful to the book and covered everything that was important.  Characters were well developed.  Mia and Michael did a wonderful job portraying Jane and Rochester, to a degree not accomplished in any previous version I have seen.  I felt that they truly encompassed the people about whom Charlotte wrote, both the innocence, determination, and loneliness of Jane, and the darkness, intensity and passion of Rochester.  Their chemistry was palpable.

I would change only two things:  First, to spend maybe a couple minutes more on the reunion at the end.  The director chose to include less dialog, and the effect wasn't lost (sometimes in reading the book, I'd find myself thinking, ""Jane, will you just stop talking!"" though in that last scene, it was Rochester resisting).  Second, I would make it more clear that Rochester was actually calling out to Jane at the very moment she heard him from many miles away.  On a side note, he didn't lose his hand here.  In other versions, it was somewhat awkwardly done, as you can't cut off the hand of the actor, so I preferred this approach.

I would HIGHLY recommend watching deleted scenes.  Some of them were wisely removed.  Others should have remained and would have added much to the telling (the badminton scene being one of them, wherein Rochester explains to Jane how he ended up with Adele, and also the scene where he begged for Jane at her bedroom door, showing his desperation and despair and broken heart).

The musical score reminded me of The Village, and I read through the entire (very long!) list of credits at the end to determine whether this was actually Hilary Hahn on the violin.  It wasn't, but sounded much like her, which is a great compliment to the violinist, Jack Liebeck.  Speaking of credits, it was nice that they included everyone, from the stand-ins, to the drivers, to the trainees--even a contact lens specialist!

Director Cary Fukinaga should be proud.  He accomplished the seeming impossible.  This has become my favorite movie.",1318896000,6,2939,4.78727634194831

I found the cast was great, the cinematography was lovely and the story line stayed true to the book.

4490806,4,B004X181TY,"I far prefer the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" starring Ruth Wilson (""THE"" best Jane of the past three decades, hands-down) and Toby Stephens.  That being said, I did applaud the Cary Joji Fukunaga production.

Unsurprisingly, the steamroller-like talent of Dame Judi Dench stole every scene as she played the role of solicitous, ever-efficient, and sentimental housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax.  Dame Dench is rightfully a British national dramatic treasure.

Mia Wasikowska's Jane was rendered in an appreciable fashion.  I recognize Ms. Wasikowska's acting skill to be significant.  While I felt she looked like the perfect Jane, I could not *entirely* believe her translation of Jane's tremulousness and resignation.

Michael Fassbender as Rochester I could not abide in the slightest.  The swaggering machismo and lengthy, blank stares simply did not fit at all with the figure of the dreary anti-hero from either the original novel, nor previous dramatic adaptations.  Far from being the mercilessly ambivalent and torn dark lord of the manor, Fassbender's portrayal came across as generally stoic and disconnected from the intense conflict that should have guided his character's role.

4490810,5,B004X181TY,"**possible spoiler alert, but really, who doesn't know Jane Eyre?** I have read, studied, and loved Jane Eyre (the novel, and the BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens) for years, and was hesitant to watch this, as all people are who love the novel. But honestly? I loved it. I thought the filmmakers did an awesome job of condensing a complex story into a 2 hour film. I enjoyed the way much of Jane's childhood was told through flashbacks while she was with the St. Johns; I thought it was a great way to work in those necessary details without spending too long on them and letting the audience get to the good stuff, ie: Rochester and Jane. Michael Fassbender is a fantastic Rochester. He's broody, quietly funny, goading, maybe a little bit dangerous, passionate, and just lovely. Fassbender pulls it off with aplomb. Mia Wasikowska is a brilliant Jane Eyre, and so is the actress who played Jane at Lowood School. The scenes between Jane and Rochester (especially the proposal scene when Jane declares herself Rochester's equal) is pivotal in the novel and can be tricky to get right without being melodramatic, but I thought it was well done in the film; although, I was waiting for the lightning to strike the tree, which disappointingly didn't happen. I once wrote a paper on how Jane represented Rochester's chance at redemption for his sins against Antoinette (read  Wide Sargasso Sea if you want to know why Rochester's wife isn't named Bertha), and was pleased that several of Rochester's lines supported that theme. I appreciate it when films can stay true not only to the plot of a novel, but the meanings behind the action as well. The cinematography was beautiful, the music appropriately haunting and dramatic without being overly done. The BBC version will still be my favorite, mostly because it's a miniseries and is able to tell the story more completely than the traditional two-hour format for films, but this version is one of the best I've seen, and far better than I was expecting. Well done and highly recommended.",1318550400,4,2038,4.822857142857143
4490811,3,B004X181TY,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I love this novel, so of course no movie adaptation would ever make me completely happy. But I think I can offer some perspective.

If you've never read Jane Eyre, then you'll find this movie to be a pleasant period costume drama, with a splendid stately home setting. However, the first thirty minutes of flashbacks will surely be confusing, since so much of Jane Eyre's youth is compressed here. As the movie settles into the love affair with Mr. Rochester, it begins to make more sense. If you don't plan on reading the novel (a pity), a quick perusal of a plot summary would surely be of help in fleshing out the missing parts before you settle in with the DVD.

If you read the novel a long time ago, the movie may whet your appetite for the real thing. It will conjure up scenes you thought you'd forgotten. And take it from me, the novel is best enjoyed the second or third time, particularly if you read it--or were forced to read it-- when you were too young. In this sense, the left-out parts, particularly Jane's life at Lowood School, may lead you straight back to the book. Who could argue with that?

And if Jane Eyre is a novel that is a favorite of yours, you'll find this film a decent one with which to while away a couple of hours. All the time you'll be thinking about how you'd really like to pick up the novel yet again to fill in all the places---the many many many places--the movie never mentions.

4490813,4,B004X181TY,"There have been numerous films made of Charlotte Bronte's great love story going back to the silent era.  This doesn't include scads of TV adaptations that appear every few years.  I think this is my favorite.  Mia Wasikowska stars as Jane giving the story true authenticity as a girl in her late teens.  As is the current flavor in movies today the story jumps back to capture a younger Jane being kicked out of her aunt's home in favor of a school for girls (read orphanage).  The film evolves into the meaty part where Jane (also in flashback) becomes the governess of a young French girl who is the offspring of a tryst between the master of the house, Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and another woman believed to have died.  Although romance in 19th century England is far removed from the mores of modern society, you can see the love spark between Jane and Edward.  What makes this story stand out however is the sliver of horror that haunts the grand old mansion.  If you are not familiar with the plot, there are some unsettling scenes involving thumps, bumps and other sound bursts.  Wasikowska plays the role with intelligence and understated beauty.  She's plain in appearance and direct in spoken word.  Speaking of words, they are beautiful to listen to, even if it's hard to catch them all in context.  The technical side of the film is also well done.  It is beautifully shot, artfully directed and sumptuously costumed.

Im afraid that it just does not hold a candle to the smoldering passion of the version with Charlotte Gainsbourg.  While the cinematic technique of telling the tale in flashbacks lends a freshness to it, the story was bland.  There was no energy to Adele, Rochester came across snarly rather than tormented, and the conflict of poor Mrs. Fairfax was glossed over.  The visuals however were stunning.  On the whole, I say rent it, don't buy it.  Especially since the special features were short, pathetic trailers.

Also, what I consider one of the most powerful elements of the story seemed completely missing - erotic tension. There seemed no sexual attraction between Jane and Rochester - in the book, that was the contrast between Rochester and St. John - one attracts her physically, humanly, while the other appeals to her spiritual, goodly side.

This DVD version of Jane Eyre jumped around at the very beginning and I suspect a viewer unfamiliar with the Jane Eyre storyline wouldn't be able to make heads or tails about what was going on for large segments of the movie. I was able to follow the story as presented in the movie only because I am very familiar with the story line as originally published. The nonsequential approach used in this version of a Jane Eyre movie may be some sort of artistic flourish in vogue with moviemakers these days, but as I mentioned, I'm old fashioned when it comes to making a movie of a literary classic, especially a classic of the standing of Jane Eyre.
  At least the acting was uniformly well done. All the principal roles were well cast. I have long suspected that the role of Mr. Rochester is regarded as a plum by male leads because there is so much leeway for acting out the idiosyncracies of that character. Some of the most entertaining and enjoyable performances I've seen have been by great actors enacting the eccentricities of the Rochester role. That role in this particular version of Jane Eyre was well done but significantly more restrained than in earlier versions.

4490822,4,B004X181TY,"If you don't like heavily-moralizing Victorian novels, you might still love this movie adaptation. This young director (Cary Joji Fukanaga) is really gifted, and his commentary on the DVD is not to be missed. I've read a lot of the negative reviews here, and without exception they are written by people who admit they adore the novel. Fair play requires that I admit it is probably my second least favorite novel of this genre after Middlemarch. Bronte twists as much sentiment as she can out of Jane's extremely narrow and abusive childhood, yet how bad could it have been given the inviolable force of Jane's character when Rochester meets her, and the moral center she occupies throughout all the novel's conflicts? Yes, there are many motivating bits this film leaves out; but if Bronte's novel as a whole were being held to some standard of psychological realism, Jane should have turned out a bit more like Bertha Mason, Rochester's crazy first wife. What the film leaves in is enough motivation for me: Jane's life and future is constrained by socio-political circumstances beyond her control. She is trapped behind many-mullioned windows when there's any daylight at all in this dark film. Rochester is her only vehicle of escape. Faced with a supercilious rival whom no one can possibly imagine Rochester might admire, Jane is survivor-enough to set her cap for him. But what triumph this match promises is shattered when she finds out she cannot legally become his wife. He is married to the mad woman in the attic. True, I wished the creepy Grace Poole were still in the film, and the confrontation with poor benighted Bertha seems kind of anticlimactic: 21st century viewers see similarly dissheveled street-people in urban America everyday. But for the film, Fukanaga supplies a stunning visual bit when Bertha, being embraced/restrained solicitously by Rochester, lifts her face and spits a fly onto Jane's bosom. I'd agree to cut Grace Poole to keep that bit in. Briefly, I recommend this film because it's handsomely photographed, well-acted, and nicely paced.

4490828,5,B004X181TY,"I'm actually knee deep in reading this classic novel right now, so when I received this current adaptation from Netflix the other night I was really excited.  I was hesitant to watch it only because I didn't want my reading pleasure spoiled and yet it was a catch 22 since I either spoil the read or the movie, and since nothings really ever spoiled my read before (I always say, if you want the emotional impact secured, you better see the movie first since the visual swells often outweigh those provided on the written page) I decided to indulge in this lush masterpiece.

First of all, this is not `yet another Jane Austen film'.  It's not even written by Jane Austen (it was adapted from the novel written by Charlotte Bronte), even though I can certainly see the comparisons made.  `Jane Eyre' carries with it that thick period drama that Austen was so heavily praised for.  Despite that similarity, there is something darker at play here.  Bronte's prose plays with tonal shifts that Austen would never have entertained.  Where Austen often came off rather light and frothy, even in the midst of tragedy (despite the emotional upheavals in stories like `Sense and Sensibility', the air is almost always crisp with pleasantries), Bronte delves deeper into the haunting quality surrounding life and love found within it.

This is most certainly a love story, but one that grounds itself in a darker corner of the human heart.

`Jane Eyre' tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated by her aunt and cousin after she is left in her care when her parents die, and then soon thereafter her uncle.  Her aunt is a devil of a woman, unkind and loathsome.  She considers Jane a burden and when she finds an opportunity to unload her on someone else (in this case, a boarding school) she takes it.  Jane is mistreated yet again in the school, but she manages to keep her wits and gain an education that leads to her becoming the governess for the young child of a Mr. Rochester.  In a lavish home, secluded with a precocious child, a kindhearted housekeeper and a brooding beast of a man, Jane begins to find her footing as Rochester's infatuation with her grows into a love she never expected by cannot deny.

And then she uncovers his deep dark secret.

I just want to take a second to laud the directorial magnificence achieved by Cary Joji Fukunaga.  The breath found in each frame is exhilarating.  He manages to find such emotional depth in the mere framing of his scenes, and that cinematography is outstanding (this film is BEAUTIFUL).  Fukunaga works wonders with his actors here as well.  Dench is so sublime when she plays, well, Dench, and she is perfectly Dench-like in this plum role for her.  Mia Wasikowska is breaking out in some big ways lately, and I'm excited for where her career is going to go.  She is wonderfully reserved and internalized here; carrying with her this stare that says so much more than she wishes it to.  Some have called her wooden (and in the case of that dreadful `Alice in Wonderland' movie, I agree), but her take on Eyre is fantastic, and I'll never forget my adoration of her performance in `The Kids Are All Right'.  The real star here though, is Michael Fassbender.  I have become obsessed with him.  The man is genius.  He just slips into character flawlessly, and his range is undeniable.  As Rochester he is equal parts grotesque and endearing.  He balances out his characters agitated demeanor with this sly arrogance that is oddly charming.

His bleeding frustrations are heartbreakingly sincere; and that final scene...

UGH...

`Jane Eyre' was an unexpected triumph, a film I was anxious to see by weary about the taste level.  There are so many period dramas that wind up being tasteless soap operas that it's really nice to see a film that brings so much `class' to a `classic'.",1317686400,3,3839,4.683582089552239
4490829,1,B004X181TY,"This disjointed version of Jane Eyre is simply not worth the money.  There was so little development of the relationship, having it leap from introduction to passion without any scenes to speak of to allow for this progression.

The relationship between Eyre and her cousins is not developed at all, simply going randomly into ""choosing"" to be family without anything said of being cousins-- in fact, it is a fiction of sister and brother that is given without a foundation in relatedness as in the book-- this is a rather random and objectionable alteration.

I love the use of flashbacks to incorporate so much of the original work.  I read the unabridged version of the book earlier this year and can appreciate how difficult is must have been to determine what to include: well done!  Fassbender is now my favorite Rochester.  He did a marvelous job of creating a character who moved from domineering and commanding master to engaging lover to heart-wrenching victim of circumstance.  I do agree with another reviewer that I would have liked to see more development in Jane: from downtrodden girl to confident young woman.  However,I appreciated the more gentle treatment of Bertha in this adaptation.  Check out The Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys for another treatment of her story.

Once the fated couple meet, it gets very good.  At any rate, the storyline is mixed through a series of flashbacks and techniques that are common enough these days, but it serves this version well in that it saves the best for last and adds some originality (if you've seen every previous rehashing of this tale). I wasn't crazy about the lead actress as Jane at first, but she definitely grew on me and she was solid overall.

The dialogue in this film far surpasses those in previous versions (of Jane Eyre) and it differs enough that it feels a bit more original while also capturing new nuances.  Also, this is the first version where I can understand and feel the burning romance--what the attraction really is--versus just hearing about it (and taking their word for it), because there is such a recognition in each other of stifled passion for life (in both characters).  The romance is the most satisfying too compared with other takes on this story. I'd say it's a solid 4 1/2, maybe a five over time, since it keeps growing on me!  Very satisfying and I can definitely watch it over and over.",1317254400,2,1260,4.62780269058296

Capturing the intensity yet restraint without overacting or over-sentimentalization is a challenge. This film pulls it off. The dialogue transfixes you and the music haunts you.

Rochester is how I imagined him and Jane is plainly beautiful. Of course, Judi Dench always belonged in this film as the housekeeper. The landscapes take your breath away at times....you feel as if you are there. If you love historical interiors, you want to freeze scenes and just study the rooms.

As soon as the movie came on, I was like ""why are they starting the movie in the middle of the book??"", but I soon got over that and got into watching.  I just didn't ""feel"" the connection between Jane and Edward like I did with other adaptations.  With the Cirran Hinds version, 1/2 way through the movie is was so obvious they were in love, not so with this one.  If I'd never seen the others or read the book, I'm sure I'd have felt like ""when did that happen??"".  Judi Dench, as always, gave a stellar performance.  She is one top-notch actress, one of my favs.  but, when Jane goes back to Thornefield and finds it burned out and abandonded, then suddenly,completely out of no where, Mrs. Fairfax ""appears"" to tell Jane what happened?  So NOT believable.  it's been abandoned by everyone but her??  it would have been so much better to just allow Jane to find out as the book laid it out.  and then we came to the end. *sigh*.  I felt cheated, ""is that it???"".  There was so much conversation between Jane and Edward in those last pages of the book, that they could have used in the movie and not taken up too much more time.  at least in the Hinds version just before the credits rolled, you see Edward and Jane strolling with their baby and looking so happy.  This one just left me feeling deflated.  I give it 4 stars because over all it is a very good movie, and the acting and the musical score was outstanding, but the directors/writers/producers could have done so much more for so little more running time and made it a much better movie.

There was so little character development as to draw me in to truly empathise with our heroine.  Her earlier years at both Gateshead and even more so at Lowood were what shaped her character and ideals.  To have the relationship with Helen Burns so lightly touched upon was a shameful neglect of the story.  Many other pieces of the story fell flat as well, notable the relationship with St. John and his sisters.  Understandably she felt indebted to their kindness, but there was no build up of (family) connection that it made you wonder why she was generous in a financial way when she inherited Mr. Eyre's wealth.

Ever since, there has not been a version of the movie or a TV show where the wonderful story was retold by a new director and the piece showcasted a new generation of talented classical actresses (mainly British).  For that reason alone, I could not wait to see this movie.

What makes this version different is that it is told in a series of flashbacks.  We go back and forth from Jane's early chidlhood, to her day as a governess at Mr. Rochester's home.  It is easy to understand her character, determination and strength from reflecting to some of the major events in her life that shaped her personality that is beautiful beyond her physical attributes.  If it is a beauty from inside that makes a person, Jane is absolutely adorable with her patience, steadfast devotion to her vocation and her friends and her intelligent ways of expressing herself.

Nothing else works if there is no angst and love. They SAY they love each other, but the actors never show this.

Then on the director's cue there is a cut while he adds a comment before we proceed to the next exchange of lines, and so on. Very ""Teleprompterish"".
Second, the acting itself was just bland, wooden.
Third, there is something too artificial about period movies that use museum quality clothing, props, building and grounds. No dust, no dirt, no worn out anything - it's just not real. Even the grounds looked so trimmed it was like a stadium's artificial turf. Plus, outside of a couple of brief appearances by indoor servants, you see no one outside doing anything.
Fourth, there wasn't a cadence or emotional tone to the movie. It seemed like a placid level lake - just existing at the same pace.",1316476800,11,1099,4.670103092783505

Currently my favorite version is the Masterpiece Theater production with Ruth Wilson.  It understands the passion and the values of Jane Eyre.  I also like Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre by A&E.  When I really want to enjoy Jane Eyre and I have the time, I love to watch the Timothy Dalton version.  Although 5-6 hours long, it is the most faithful to the novel.  If I want a shorter version, I might also watch Orson Welles as Mr. Rochester.  I am glad I added this to my collection of Jane Eyre movies, but I will probably not watch it again.

I have to confess I am more of a Jane Austin fan, than a Charlotte Bronte fan.  Nonetheless, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite characters.  I admire the struggle she has between her passion and her morals.  Good stuff.",1316476800,4,1001,4.306451612903226
4490849,2,B004X181TY,"There have been many thoughtful reviews here, some giving great praise, some excoriating, so I'll restrict myself to stating what I have not seen here yet, and that's my continuing dismay that not a single version yet of Jane Eyre (that I've seen) has fulfilled Charlotte Bronte's vision:  to prove to the world that audiences will fall in love with an ugly hero and a woman, as she put it, ""as plain as I am.""  I've seen paintings of Charlotte Bronte. She didn't look like Mia Wasikowska.

What makes this version the most egregious in this area is that BOTH actors are beautiful. In most versions, they have a gorgeous Rochester (which I'm sure would make Charlotte laugh pretty hard, unless it made her cry with frustration)  and a Jane played by an actress who is plain by Hollywood standards (and would probably be the prettiest girl in the room anywhere else), or a lovely Jane and a homely Rochester (George C. Scott, Orson Welles).  In this one we have not one, but TWO hot to trot Hollywood gorgeous actors playing a man repeatedly described in the book, including by Jane herself, as ugly, and a woman who is called a little toad and someone formed for labor, not for love.

What is so odd about this is that British productions DO cast plainish actresses and actors, all the time.  They cast a plain actress to play the beautiful Esther in Bleak House.  They cast Burn Gorman to play a hot, sexy doctor on Torchwood.  Why is it that casting directors are so skittish about Jane Eyre?  Why the Mia Wasikowskas and Toby Stephens and Timothy Daltons?

The closest to getting it right is the one with Samantha Morton, a good looking woman who can be made to look homely with the right lighting, and Ciaran Hinds who again is somewhat good looking but not handsome in the usual sense. In this version, the derogatory comments about Jane, and Rochester's severe insecurity, make sense.

In five years, when they make another Jane Eyre, here's hoping they have the guts to do what Charlotte Bronte did, make the point that audiences can fall in love with the coupling of a homely  woman and an ugly man.",1316390400,7,2107,4.586666666666667

Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester are excellent. The feel of the location and time (and accent in most cases) are beautifully rendered.

Well, when the actress portraying the title character does as fine a job as Mia Wasikowska does here, the answer is ""yes.""

Really, Ms. Wasikowska is a revelation in this film, giving a performance of surpassing skill and subtlety.  Like the scorned orphan she plays, she seems plain at first, but as the strength and integrity of her character become known, she grows more radiantly lovely.

She is supported here by a fine cast, notably Michael Fassbender as Rochester and Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax.

The young director Cary Fukunaga claims he was striving for a more gothic tone than in the famous 1943 version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  In this he is somewhat less than successful, given that the most ""haunting"" scenes were cut from the theatrical version (but are included on this DVD as deleted scenes).

Nevertheless the real-light cinematography is well-done and helps convey the mood and look of the time and place.

Finally I'm pleased to say that this is not a ""stripped"" DVD -- it has director's commentary, plus a few short making-of featurettes.

Every film adaptation of Jane Eyre brings something to the table, has great appeal to each generation.  The multi-part versions are able to embrace the novel more thoroughly, the feature-length all endeavor to distill and capture the emotional power of the novel.

Fukunaga's Jane Eyre is for me one of the most beautifully filmed versions, some scenes simply breath-taking (the carriage returning Jane to Thornfield).  The settings work, the costuming and sets (thankfully) understated.  The cast is outstanding.

Where this Jane Eyre gave me problems was the screen play.  While I truly liked the film cleverly opening the way it did (Vol. 3 of the novel), the condensing of dialogue felt like short-hand---I was automatically filling in with Bronte's.  I wonder what a new audience gets or misses: the mirroring of the Gateshead family in Vol. 1 with the Rivers family in Vol. 3, the cut-off-from-the-world environment of Lowood and Bertha in the attic.

That said, screen play avoided the awkward Eyre-Rivers relationship (they are cousins)and the over-the-top gothic palm reader bit.  The mention of insane asylums conditions added clarity to the often misunderstood situation of Bertha.

4490857,5,B004X181TY,"As a new version of a book with as many adaptations as `Jane Eyre' (some versions more forgotten than others), this film needed to be a fresh look at an old classic, and as faithful as possible in 2 hours. In my opinion, it's as good as it could be while ticking all of those boxes. (This review is rather long, but it covers, I think, all possible concerns.)

A film called `Jane Eyre' needs a believable title character and Mia Wasikowska is perfect for Jane - I didn't expect to be so impressed. She's quiet but she lets rays of light slip out, showing her imagination beneath (which is exactly how Rochester describes Jane in the book). She shows Jane's first-person narration through her stunning skill with expression - one non-spoilery example is her utterly relatable mortification when Jane recognises Pilot.

Michael Fassbender is certainly the best-looking Rochester I've ever seen but beauty truly is of little consequence - he's also the most charismatic, showing the character's playful side while retaining the gruffness that a lot of other portrayals seem to focus on. Personally I found that the chemistry between Jane and Rochester was particularly arresting and their scenes together were very charged, as much due to what was said as what wasn't. Put it this way - when I picture Jane and Rochester, I now picture these two. Beforehand, I had always pictured Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens - not because it was the latest or only adaptation I'd seen; it was the first, and I've seen 3 others since.

The supporting cast is predictably brilliant - Judi Dench as the friendly but somewhat prim housekeeper Mrs Fairfax, and Jamie Bell as the generous but insensitive St. John, are obviously excellent, but I think special mention needs to go to the young girls who played Jane and Adle (and to an extent Helen), who, when on screen, weren't eclipsed at all by the adults. Subtle facts round out the atmosphere. At night, the only light is indeed creepy candlelight - an accuracy often left out for convenience. I really liked little detailed inclusions such as Jane's rural accent, Adle actually speaking French, the focus on Jane's passion for drawing - including actually seeing the pictures - and the inclusion of music within the story. Mrs Fairfax's despair when not only Adle but also Jane is fascinated by Rochester's abrupt shift from playing the piano to shooting birds was a charming illustration of how the two leads are similarly in need of intellectual stimulation from each other.

It's also worth mentioning that the dialogue directly repeated from the book is actually memorable dialogue. I laughed aloud in the cinema at 'And now I see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.' I loved Jane's impassioned 'Equal - AS WE ARE!' Rochester saying tormentedly, 'I could snap her with finger and thumb but she still won't yield' was an unusual way to do that scene, which is usually not desperate enough or too soppy. I did, however, wince at the fact that they couldn't resist turning 'whence' into 'from whence' at one point.

All the key scenes were included, and more than any other adaptation has done, they made me smile irrepressibly just like the book. Some people haven't liked the way the film starts in the middle of the story, or doesn't dwell on the beginning, but I thought it was very well-judged - it's a change, plus I've always found the non-Rochester parts of the story hard-going when placed chronologically. They covered the whole story, with the non-Rochester parts given the importance that most readers give them (me, in any case). Jane's friendship with Helen was heartwarming without being overly long, its effect on Jane touchingly shown not by the usual drawn-out sentimentality but by a scene in which the adult Jane has painted Helen after remembering her days at Lowood. The tension between Jane and St. John was spot on - and I absolutely adored an additional view that the writers gave us into Jane's psyche during the separation part.

The only thing that they totally left out was the fortune-teller scene. This was somewhat thankfully forgotten, as it would be hard to film it faithfully AND sensitively; however, as the point of that scene was supposed to be Rochester trying to determine Jane's feelings, I felt as if one single scene was taken for granted and they should have replaced it with that. It was no particular scene - but that was just it. The reason I love Jane and Rochester so much is that they're not one of those overrated `misconceived animosity turns into love via good deed' couples (P&P, anyone?!) - they took to each other instantly and thought it too good to be true. I think it needed *one* more scene to show their mutual pleasant shock at finding an affinity with someone so unexpectedly, despite age difference (also strangely unmentioned). Genuine chemistry between *characters* and not actors is even harder to show in a film, and it was about 95% perfect, but seeing as they had actors who portrayed the characters accurately, they could have made it 100% perfect in even just one more scene - so it was somewhat frustrating.

(SPOILER) I also really liked the way the film dealt with Bertha. I find that the somewhat stereotyped, underdeveloped portrayal of Bertha in the book is one of the few ways in which Charlotte Bront did go with the conventions of her time. It can be problematic and most adaptations deal with its vagueness by making her some kind of supernatural foreign creature. This version is much more sensitive; Rochester mentions the fact that his dislike of her wasn't due to her madness, that he tried to live with her for 4 years and refused to condemn her to maltreatment in an asylum - and notably it didn't glamourise the fire and her death with a jarring 'flashback' as is so often done. It's a sort of simpler alternative to `Wide Sargasso Sea'. I found the fact that Bertha, too, receives sympathy, and that Fortune is the only real 'antagonist', made the Jane/Rochester story much more profound.

I've given this 5 stars - even though there are things I'd have liked to see, in other versions where they're included, the cinematography, pace and characterisation are nowhere near as striking. For fans of the book who want brilliant representations of the key scenes in the story, I can't stress enough that this version does them outstandingly. In a way, it's good that the whole progression isn't covered because while the film was stunning, it makes the book something that people can go back to, and not just to discover the characters in their true sense, as with many adaptations - rather, to rediscover the same characters from the film, just more of them. It more than made up for my fury that it came out in the US months before it did here in the UK - my wait was well worth it. This film is literally as much of Charlotte Bront's story as could be put on film in 2 hours, and I ran home to return to the book with pleasure.",1315958400,18,6961,4.737623762376238
4490858,4,B004X181TY,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal and bought it for my home collection. However, my brother who had not read the book watched it with me and asked so many questions it quickly became clear to me that people who have NOT read the book might easily become confused. First of all, this movie starts in the middle of the book and then quickly jumps back to Jane's childhood, which it virtually glosses over, then switches back, with many flashbacks thrown in here and there. Jane's childhood must've taken up about one-fourth of the novel (I am guessing from memory) but the movie gives it about ten minutes, if that, and so doesn't really set up the mood quite like the book did. The movie doesn't make it clear that the treatment of the children at the school caused a huge portion of the student population to die, that Jane survived it while watching her best and only friend die, that she has been mistreated and abused repeatedly by people who she was under the authority of who were supposed to be her protectors, and how all those events impacted the person she became and her hesitancy to trust. It is never explained that Jane's rescuers are her cousins, that they are in need of money and stand to inherit from a relative that died, nor that she is the reason the money is tied up, as she is the main beneficiary. In addition, the scene from the book where Jane is outside with her male cousin on a dark night and hears Rochester's voice on the wind, and immediately and intrinsically knows something is wrong- and vows to herself to go to him- is filmed entirely differently here and with less intensity. The scene I had hoped most for- where Rochester returns home unexpectedly, posing as a fortune-telling gypsy, and the wonderful monologue directed at Jane which reveals his feelings to the reader as he verbalizes them for himself and makes Jane feel she must be dreaming- was not part of this film, nor was it included in the deleted scenes! (Sigh.) Oh yes- and the ending was changed, which isn't bad, but the other one was so good! So why four stars? The acting was superb and the cinematography was wonderful! Michael Fassbender was perfect as the emotional Rochester and Mia Wasikowska was an excellent, intelligent Jane. And don't let me forget to mention Judi Dench who played the role of the housekeeper with such depth and insight she may have improved the character Bront created. The acting really was very good and the chemistry of the two lead actors worked. Yes, the film wasn't perfectly true to the novel but the spirit was the same. I highly recommend this but encourage you to read the book, too! You'll be so glad you did!",1315872000,2,2653,4.563941299790357
4490859,2,B004X181TY,"What a piece of crap! This version leaves out soo many of the important details! I.E. Mrs. Rochester ripping up the Veil! How about the details involving Mr. Rochester's mistress in Paris? There was also no witty banter between the two that characterize their relationship. It is all doom and gloom in this version. They could have done so much more with a Hollywood version, which they don't typically have the financing to do with a miniseries- I mean come on could they not have at least included Rochester's horrific injuries at the end? For people who have actually read the book, this is a weak attempt at an adaptation. Save your money and watch the Masterpiece Theater version starring Ruth Wilson, and Toby Stephens. I am going to have to watch that one twice just to get the awful taste of this movie out of my mouth. In that version there is a heated chemistry between the two that is palpable, and that movie sticks to the book, perhaps not as well as the 1983 Timothy Dalton version, but at least after watching that one I felt...well not pissed off for starters.",1315872000,6,1076,4.580310880829016
4490860,2,B004X181TY,I recieved this film and looked forward to watching it with great anticipation. The reviews from the critics and on Amazon had been glowing and this film was mean't to be the film adaptation to end all...Ah no. I can't say how disappointed I was with this version. Maybe the director just couldn't decide whether it should be a gothic thriller or a love story. Certainly the actors seemed to be a bit confused. There was absolutley no chemisty between Mia Wasiskowka and Michael Fassbender... They are both as cold as an artic winter and there is no reason why they suddenly develope this passion for each other other than they were trapped at Thornfield Hall and were a bit bored. Judi Dench as ususal was wonderful to watch but she couldn't save this clunker. And what happened to Mrs Rochester...she was barely a passing reflection in a window... Maybe the problem is that the length and depth of the novel is not suitable to be compressed such as this is into two hours. If you are wanting to see two excellent production then both BBC Jane Eyre's with Zela Clark and Timothey Dalton  or Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are far superior.,1315785600,6,1139,4.610837438423645
4490861,1,B004X181TY,"This adaptation was poorly done. Much was left out of the story and the decision to start the film at the end was doubly confusing. If I did not have a good understanding of the plot - I would have been woefully lost while viewing this version.

The chemistry that NEEDS to build between Rochester and Jane was never allowed to blossom nor were the actors suited for this purpose.  Mia Wasikowska (Jane) was completely one dimensional and Michael Fassbender (Mr. Rochester), though intended to be disliked at first, never rose above that sentiment for me. If I were Jane, I would have run from him!

Adding to the poor casting was the poor cinematography (is Jane's world really a constant greenish-gray color?) as well as the fact that it was just plain boring. Even Judi Dench (Mrs. Fairfax), who I admire as a quality actress, could not liven this script.

Read the book and you will understand.

I recommend the 1996 adaption that features William Hurt as Rochester and as Charlotte Gainsbourg Jane Eyre. Chemistry,chemistry, chemistry! And a good retelling of the story.",1315785600,12,1075,4.820652173913044

4490863,5,B004X181TY,"(Review originally posted at ReadBreatheRelax.com)

This movie is visually stunning and emotionally powerful. I was transfixed, as Mr. Rochester would say. The scenes are lush- rolling hills, fiery susets, finely-manicured gardens. It's all so beautiful. And it contrasts well with the sparse joy and pleasure that Jane experiences in her life. She faces cruelty at the hands of her aunt and at the boarding school that she attends later. Then Jane takes the position as governess at Thornfield, the home of Mr. Rochester, and she finally finds independence, happiness and love.

As far as the book goes- it has been several years since I read it (we're talking middle school), but it all seemed to match up. If there were any key elements left out, I didn't notice. I really enjoyed the narrative style of the movie, too. It began sort of near the end of the story and worked it's way back, which was a refreshing take of this classic that's been told and re-told many times before.

There was one tiny detail missing at the end, but I can't mention it as it is kind of a spoiler. If you want to know what it is, please leave a comment, and I'll be glad to fill you in privately! One lady in the theater even shouted out the missing detail after the movie was over: ""Where's `XYZ'? What happened to it??"" She was clearly irate as well as elderly, so she got away it with being a little crazy.

Probably my favorite part of the whole movie is the emphasis on Jane's difference from those around her and how she is very unlike other women. The book pointed out heavily that she was extremely plain as well as poor and had a fey-like quality. She longs for independence and freedom from the harsh environment where she grew up. It's an empowering story, especially for women during that time period. I love strong women, and I see that in the small, reserved person of Jane Eyre.

OVERALL

I bought this movie the day it was released. It's beautiful and moving and deeply romantic. A great way to experience the novel.",1315526400,2,2016,4.570637119113574

4490865,3,B004X181TY,"This is not my favorite version of the Jane Eyre story, but it is by no means bad. Mia does a great job portraying Jane, as did the young actress who played her child counterpart. My biggest problem was with Fassbender as Rochester. I usually like Fassbender, but I thought he was very bland as Rochester. He didn't evoke enough passion, even at the end. My favorite version is the 2006 BBC version with Toby Stephens, who was great as Rochester. I recommend that one, but if you're a fan of Mia or Michael, this one is fine too.",1315526400,5,529,4.353535353535354
4490866,5,B004X181TY,"Slight spoilers... Nothing major... As with many films nowadays I simply rented this because I have little time to see everything I want to in the theatre. I was floored by what I saw. I knew nothing of this story and, thankfully too, as this film has some dark secrets. As I was watching I was even wondering if this was about to become a vampire film. This gothic style  film comes about as close as possible to being a  horror film without actually being one. It was gorgeously photographed, well acted, and had a beautiful score that I grabbed the very same night I rented the film. The main character Jane Eyre is a fully realized and entirely complete character. Her past history is shown along the way, as most of the film is a flashback. Despite her harsh upbringing she manages to retain her integrity along the way. So often I expected her to snap and take revenge on some witch  of a character along the way but instead she retains her composure and remains true to herself and beliefs. She does snap once as a kid. This film has a religious undercurrent and subtleties regarding love that may not be for everyone. This is a love story but it is also a film about our stations in life and how just being true to oneself is all we need ever be. I watched it twice in one night and think this is one of the best films I have seen all year. It is one of the best period films i have seen in a very long time and right up there with Barry Lyndon and some Merchant Ivory films. Also, for anyone who loves films with strong, well realized female main characters this is the film for you.",1315440000,2,1592,4.264900662251655

Mia is just who I envisioned Jane to be and (Rochester) is pretty easy on the eyes :)  (I am willing to overlook that minor inaccuracy from the book) and their chemistry was the best I've seen so far. My favorite scene was when Rochester tries to win back Jane.  I could watch that scene a thousand times and never get sick of it! The cinematography is BEAUTIFUL! Although, sometimes it seems like there is more time spent on the scenery than is neccessary.  Again, I can overlook that.  It does seem a bit misjointed though.  It jumps from the middle to bits and pieces of the beginning and then jumps back toward the end.  I understand what Fukunaga was getting at for effect but still, if someone was watching this for the first time without reading the book, I could understand them getting lost.  Again, I can overlook the detail of the book broken up, but what I CANNOT overlook is the ending!  GRRR!!!  I had to watch the last couple scenes of the BBC 2006 version in order to feel any sense of closer!  It cuts off soooo abruptly and TOTALLY misses out on one of my favorite parts of the entire book (aside from Rochester begging for Jane to come back of course).  AHH!! Even after watching a different version, I still am a little taken back.  I will probably watch this again before my rental period is over (with 2006 on cue), but I don't think I would ever buy it.

4490871,5,B004X181TY,"I have read the reviews of others, and have seen this movie and have been a huge fan of the book.  In fact, it was the first classic I ever read and, like so many lovers of particular books, I read the book every year.  It doesn't lose anything.

I have issues with the negative views.  1) why in the world would anyone buy a movie without seeing it in the theatre first?  2) I would like to remind all those who hold it as a ""great love story"", that the book isn't just about a love story, it's about a woman who breaks with almost all standards of the time.  She seeks her independence, she takes her life into her own hands and accepts the reprocussions, even when it goes badly (like wandering off into the moors without a hint of where to go).  She does not harber hatred or grudges and moves beyond them into a quiet, almost Zen-like, grace of being.  She is intelligent and makes on excuses for that intelligence.  She wants Rochester, but only on her own terms and only when she can meet him as an equal and will not compromise her position, even when it may leave her with nothing.

Yes, it's gothic and dark.  Yes, the moral compass of our beloved characters are, at times, very questionable.  Even Jane's.  However, what we have is a very human person.  Someone we can relate to.  In fact, ALL the characters have something in each of them that we can all relate too.  Even poor Bertha, in her mad, instinct driven way is human and real.

This movie does not disappoint.  Those that say it is void of emotion, I have to wonder if we watched the same film.  Those that compare the Timothy Dalton version (because the woman playing Jane is totally forgettable and so cardboard); The original with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine (classic Hollywood, so not near the book) - all these have their good points but frankly, they all lack something and leave out amounts.

This movie is the closest to the book.  There is more than enough emotion FOR THE TIME PERIOD.  Remember that this was the Victorian Era.  The fact that Jane is as independent as she is, is almost unheard of.  A great deal of versions leave out St John River and his sisters.  And frankly, the idea that Jane is actualy related to people that she JUST HAPPENS to run into in the middle of the moor, in the middle of the night, in an area she has never been, has always seemed SO out there (Charlotte Bronte would have been better to state that Jane was going to an area that her parents and family lived in and she was going to go back there and start a new life - then it would have been believable).  Frankly, this movie does a better job.  and Mia is FANTASTIC as Jane.  Just pretty enough to not be confused with the help, and yet plain enough to stand out amoung Rochester and his friends.

Great movie; Great Actors; Fantastic adaptation.  The only way to make this better?  Make it 3.5 hours long!  The story could only be better as a 2 or 3 part mini-series.

(And for the person who compared the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to Jane Eyre - I would like to remind you that Austen and Bronte lived many decades apart; lived in totally different family dynamics; had completely different outlooks on life; and in fact, Charlotte Bronte was not a fan of Jane Austen.  And frankly, the new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice was not great.  When you have a period drama, you need to remain period.)",1315267200,3,3384,4.36

While I am a true fan of the 2006 version of Jane Eyre, I must admit to being a HUGE Michael Fassbender fan and have been looking forward to seeing this adaptation of the film since hearing about it last year. I think Fassbender did a terrific portrayal of Mr. Rochester, and Mia shocked me with her perfect rendition of Jane. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to view this film in the theater but sure wish I would've! I really missed out! Immediately after watching it, I wanted to watch it again. Casting for this film was perfect, and the director did a fantastic job with the overall setting and cinematography. The lighting/setting was appropriately dark and gloomy. If you are a fan of period films, you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is I wish the film would have been a bit longer.

4490875,4,B004X181TY,"That's what I have after watching this dvd twice: a decidedly mixed reaction. Like many other reviewers, I'm a die-hard Jane Eyre fan, having read the book too many times to count and seen at least 6 film adaptations (I think there have been at least 8). This dvd is the 5th I've added to my collection, which my children find absolutely hilarious. But anyway, I wanted to see this one at the theater but it was only in my hometown for about a week, so I ordered it as soon as Amazon had it. I guess I should just lay out my pros and cons and let the chips fall where they may.

Pros: The casting is possibly the best of any version I've seen. Mia Whatchamacallit (sorry, can't remember her name right now) was 21 when the film was shot, making her about the right age to play Jane. All the other versions I've seen cast actresses who were well past their teen years, so it was good to see a more-age-approriate Jane. She also did a nice job with the role, expressing shades of emotion in her face since her lines are frankly rather limited. Michael Fassbender is honestly too young (34) and too good-looking (he was the smokin' hot warrior Stelios in 300) but does a very good job inhabiting the character of Rochester. He's very gruff with just the right hint of humor to make Rochester the irritating but somehow intriguing guy he is. The other roles were also well-cast. Judi Dench is always amazing, and Jamie Bell (though not as handsome as St. John should be, imho) was appropriately stern. The cinematography of the movie is just lovely. I really liked the lighting. Everything at Gateshead is sunlit and colorful, belying the hellish existence Jane endures there. Lowood school is spare and colorless, and Thornfield is mostly lighted from underneath with the only light falling on the characters seeming to come from candles and fireplaces. This creates an air of mystery and confusion as the viewer can never really get a good enough view of the place to even be sure of its layout. I liked the notion of starting the story with Jane's escape from Thornfield and the rest being told in flashback, but I can't say if that would be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story or not.

Cons: I suppose nobody could condense this huge novel into a 2 hour movie and not leave out something I thought was important, but I felt too many details were omitted. Jane's character development as well as that of the relationship between Jane and Rochester were dealt with so quickly that they lost some of the depth of emotion they should have had. The conclusion of the film occurs so abruptly that I got a bit angry. It was sort of a ""You've got to be kidding!"" reaction that it just suddenly ended without what I thought was adequate closure. Some scenes, such as Jane's flight over the moors, were lovely but rather long, and I found myself wishing some of those scenes had been cut to give more scenes that ""fleshed out"" the story.

So my mixed reaction still allows me to recommend the movie. I think it is a good and respectful adaptation of one of my favorite novels as well as a visually lovely film with a solid cast.",1315180800,288,3129,4.49560632688928
4490876,5,B004X181TY,"I love ""Jane Eyre""; I read it about once a year, have seen most of the movie versions, and they all manage to do some things well and Not So Well on other things. Two things that I thought were great about this version were that 1)Mia Wasikowska was the closest screen version of Jane to what I imagined in the book (other actresses either too old and/or too obviously pretty, and 2) there was actually chemistry between Jane and Rochester, despite their clear separation in class, age and expectations. Seriously, they sizzle - this is not a Rainbows, Puppy Dogs and Daisies kind of attraction, and Jane, at least, is not sure how to handle it. The novel was considered scandalous when it was published because of the sexual undertones (now tame by our standards), and in this version the two main characters CLEARLY want each other. St. John Rivers was also handled well in this film (often glossed over in other versions) and Judi Dench, as always, is Amazing.

There are a couple areas where it falls a little short for me; I wish that there had been more time devoted to Jane and Rochester's snappy and sometimes biting repartee, and I would have liked the resolution to have a little more, well, resolution. Michael Fassbender is a bit too purty for my idea of Rochester. Having said that, something is always going to be cut when turning a novel into a two hour movie, and I think this is a fine version that any fan of Jane should at least give a try.

...and did I mention that incredible sizzle?",1315094400,24,1505,4.509157509157509
4490877,1,B004X181TY,"The movie is not horrible I give it that, but I would say it leaves out too much of the story and takes too many dialogues out of context.  Yes, I am I die hard fan of Jane Eyre, read the book many times and have watched many of the versions that are available in movie and on television.  The actors are okay and most do justice to the characters, but none would I call my favorites or flesh out any of the characters well.  The chemistry to me is lacking, the story is rushed and some key elements in the story have been left out (the change in ending, the gypsy seen omitted, the development of the relationship that is reflected in the many dialogues between Jane and Mr. Rochester that have been left out, etc.).  It may just be me and the way I first envisioned the book when I first read it but this movie is just lacking in all these things and more.  The novel is a bit dark at times, but not like this and to me this version is overly dramatic at times.  Yes, I am one who likes the BBC version, the Masterpiece Theatre Version and I can also enjoyed versions such as the 2003 (William Hurt & Charlotte Gainsbourg) version  and 2007 (Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine) version.  I not against some deviations from the novel, but to me the importance is with the chemistry between the characters, the main bulk of the story falling in line with the book and in reading the development of the characters as individuals.  Many people may love this version, but in my opinion this is a version is one that I can honestly say I definitely wouldn't have missed anything if I never had saw.  But, I have said it is a matter of taste...apparently not mine but may be to someone else.",1315094400,11,1682,4.261006289308176
4490878,4,B004X181TY,"I have seen this film twice.

First Viewing:

I am a die hard Jane Eyre fan and have seen almost every movie version of this story. The first time that I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. I think I was bias because I love the 2006 and 1985(Timothy Dalton) version so much. I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong. The acting was good...the cinematography was gorgeous...but it was lacking something. There are some scenes that were amazing and worth seeing (Scene where Rochester comes clean about his wife and begs Jane to stay with him). They had to cram a lot in a 2 hour movie and I think that is what hurt it. Her years at school are cut short and the Helen Burns story is almost non existent. The love story happened to fast. It was like Jane meets Mr. Rochester and BAM their in love. The movie would have been a lot better if they had been given more time to tell the story and if Jane had showed more emotion (After my second viewing, I changed my mind about this). The movie is different from all the other versions because it is told in flashback and not in the order of the book. I thought that was creative, but it was like watching a documentary and not a love story. Perhaps the audience was only seeing Jane's most important memories. Not sure.

Second Viewing

I have to say that it is much better than I remembered. I compare my initial reaction to this movie to the way I felt about Kiera Knightley's Pride and Prejudice.  I hated that movie the first time I watched it, but have grown fond of it on later viewings.  Both movies suffer from the same symptom, to much storyline crammed into 2 hours.  Michael and Mia did an excellent job with the script that they were given.  At first, I was frustrated because Mia rarely shows Jane's feelings for Rochester until the marriage proposal. On second viewing, this makes more sense to me.  I mean this is a character that grew up in a all girl's school and is unaccustomed to men or flirting.  It was actually kinda of funny because you see Rochester trying to flirt/make not-so-subtle romantic overtures to Jane and she is confused/doesn't know how to react to his behavior. Very believable. I recommend watching it a couple of times before deciding whether you like it or not.",1315008000,6,2256,4.414457831325302
4490879,5,B004X181TY,"I've seen every Jane Eyre movie made and this one is my favorite one so far.  It is fabulous.  If you haven't seen a Jane Eyre movie, this one might be a little confusing the first time around, but once you know the story line, you will thoroughly enjoy it. It was creative, the scenery was beautiful, and the music score was wonderful. The story line stayed true to the book, which I always enjoy.",1315008000,,398,4.293333333333333
4490880,1,B004X181TY,"I wanted to buy this movie as a companion to my Masterpiece version with Tobey Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  I ordered it on Comcast first, and I am glad I did. I only wasted $5 rather than the full price of the dvd.  I love the story, but this version is disjointed and bland as dish water!  It's like the poor man's version of the BBC mini-series.  And everything is either rushed or totally missing!  If you weren't familiar with the story, you would be totally lost!  I so wanted to like this movie, but I can't....it is just bad.",1315008000,11,531,4.26
4490881,4,B004X181TY,"I've always loved the story of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and have watched numerous adaptations. My favorite by far is the 1983 BBC version starring Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. I missed the theatrical release of this recent version but managed to get the DVD and watched it a couple of days ago.

Some have reviled this cinematic adaptation of Jane Eyre as not being faithful to the novel. Though it is true that this adaptation takes too many liberties with the original plot, I felt that given the constraints of movie-making and adhering to a set time limit, the movie was actually quite good. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, and the score is suitably haunting and subdued. What made this a compelling movie to watch was the amazing performances of the two leads, i.e. Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and brooding Michael Fassbender as Edward Rochester. Wasikowska plays Jane with an otherworldly ,ethereal quality that truly brought the Jane of the novel alive for me. As for Fassbender, there was just something compelling about him, and the strong chemistry between Jane Eyre and Rochester is credibly conveyed through the actions and words of the two actors.

The supporting cast did a good job too - Dame Judi Dench makes for a suitably convincing Mrs. Fairfax, and Jamie Bell as the missionary St. John Rivers also did a good turn in his role. It is never easy to compress a great novel into the limits of a two hour dramatic film, but I think director Cary Fukunaga did an above average job with the limitations she was presented with.",1315008000,,1595,4.77536231884058
4490882,1,B004X181TY,I pre ordered this and was really looking forward to seeing it but right from the first scenes I was very disappointed. I didn't like that they went on and on with her leaving and trudging around after discovering he was married before they finally got around to getting on with the story. Plus it gave away a latter part of the story. Then for a long time they jumped back and forth in the story. Nothing wrong with the casting. I thought all were good. I would just have preferred that the movie follow the book more closely. I won't look at it again and will resell it at a half price store.,1314835200,8,594,4.219298245614035
4490883,5,B004X181TY,"This is oddly my favorite film of the novel. Oddly, meaning, only because it leaves out important scenes of the story. Everything else, the acting, the costumes, even the parts where script was rearranged (which were done quite well, actually). I just wish that a few scenes were left in. A bit more of Jane's school life, and a few key scenes that tell more of how Jane and Rochester start to fall for each other. Books into movies, no one should dare expect the entirety of said book to be put into script. However, some important parts, again, should have been left in.

But the actors, the setting, the clothing even, and of course the music, capture the essence of the story to a T. Remarkable. Wasikowska couldn't have been a better pick for the role of Jane, she plays her exactly as I ever imagined. Not to mention, she looks the part entirely. No other adaptation had a young enough looking actress, nor one done so damn well. Fassbender, oh my, the best Rochester yet. He fits the description that ""Jane"" portrays to her readers perfectly. Athletic build, the high forehead, etc, not exactly the type for ""handsome"" in those days. (A bit opposite, in this day and age, hah.) He plays the role of stern, ill tempered, a bit pompous, yet somehow charming and enjoyable all the same time, beautifully. Dench as Mrs. Fairfax? I shouldn't even need to explain why she was perfect for the role. So I will not. Clarkson as the young Jane, what an amazing young actress. I hope to see her in more films, for such a young age, well, regardless of that even, she is better than most adult actresses I have seen.

The modern approach on the telling of the story, starting with the end and working some flashback action in, I actually found a bit refreshing. An excellent way to tell the story, honestly. Every other version has done a cover-to-cover style, which is also good and all, but it was a nice change.

The entire cast is just perfect, their emotions are played out perfectly. No overdone dramatic scenes, no over the top love scenes either. The subtlety that I got from the book between Jane and Rochester are done beautifully. I really do wish, again, though, that a handful of important scenes were kept from the novel. Regardless, I can't seem to not want to watch this version. And read the book, again, compare, etc. Sorry if I rambled a bit, cats!",1314835200,2,2362,4.552941176470588
4490884,1,B004X181TY,"This version was so poorly done I had to turn it off half-way through! There is no passion, no chemistry, no reason to believe these people would have ever fallen for each other. Of course I didn't watch the whole thing, but I did watch enough to know that I didn't believe their romance. By the time I turned it off they had bored me with parts that I thought they would have shortened but hadn't. They cut out important parts, like two of the conversations between Mr. R and Jane leading up to them falling for each other. The conversation they did have was dull, uninteresting and left me not liking Mr. R where in other versions it is the same conversation where one would start liking Mr. R.

I've seen quite a few adaptions of the film and I cannot understand how this can be a favorite, but to each his own, I suppose. The mini-series from Masterpiece Theatre (2007) is much, much better. This movie begins right as Jane is running away from Mr. Rochester and the movie is basically a series of flashbacks. It leaves out so much from the book and after watching it I was completely disappointed. As many movie adaptions as there are of the novel already I was expecting something a little better.

There is no passion or spark to her performance. It's as if she has no interest in the role that she is playing. If she has no interest, why should we?

And yet this film version shows no emotion. I felt no passion between Jane and Rochester. These actors said their lines with no feeling. And to make matters worse someone changed the ending of the story.  Do Not waste any money on this film.,1314316800,26,404,4.315789473684211
4490891,5,B004X181TY,"""Jane Eyre,"" oh Jane Eyre, Charlotte would have loved this version of her book writ large on the big screen. I was so wowed by this film: actors, setting, costumes, and a true transformation from paper to celluloid or a digital rendering. Breathtaking, emotionally rich, and ultimately satisfying, ""Jane Eyre"" is utterly true to the book.

I rather smiled in reading that another reviewer thinks Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester. That means she has not seen the version with Orson Wells. But I nitpick. Michael Fassbender is superb. Mia Wasikowska is superb. Jamie Bell is excellent (if you can allow yourself to call someone so uptight as excellent, but I'm describing acting). That's it then. That's all you need to know, except the location IS the wild setting of the novel.

If I had to pick the most effective aspect of the film, I would tap Director Fukunaga's decision to use a flashback to tell the story. (I don't remember if Charlotte actually wrote her novel this way.) He begins with Jane running, running away from Thornfield, from Rochester. She finally collapses in abject misery, wailing and wailing, with the lonely moors, the stunted shrubs as her cold comfort. She finally stumbles, in numbing despair, at the door of the Rivers family.

By the time the flashback wends its way back to the moor scene, the viewer must wail with Jane,  empathetically, completely caught up in her intense feelings for Rochester, instead of coldly watching this scene. The viewer now understands Jane's terrible illness--it's not of the body but of the spirit. Healing does come, and when it does, it allows for a glorious, but bittersweet ending.

""Jane Eyre."" Jane Eyre. A fabulous story, a strong character. Either way, definitely a winner! Highly recommended!",1314316800,3,1767,4.976271186440678

Anyone who thinks this is an accurate portrayal of the characters from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte clearly has never read or does not understand the novel.  This was the worst and most horrible version of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen.  It is simply awful -- it is far too ""hurried"".  The flashing back and forth is most annoying and disjointed and from the terrible acting one cannot gain a true sense of the characters as they were written.  I love and greatly admire the Bronte sisters works, have read all of their books and writings dozens of times and have visited Haworth in Yorkshire.  I have run on the moors amongst the heather yelling ""Heathcliff""!!  Do not waste your time with this movie; it is a wretched and feeble attempt to recreate on screen one of the greatest written masterpieces of all time.

Only the version made with Orson Wells where he plays Edward Rochester could be considered as being the worst. This is a close second!

It is such a true representation of the book that after the movie was over I could think of nothing important that they had left out or skimmed over.  It is such a smart movie with a heroine that proves witty and self restrained all at once.  The casting is perfect and the pace is neither rushed nor does it drag along like many other period movies.  Though the bleak grey landscape of the movie does not reveal it, this is a story of all consuming passion.  Instead of the premise of other romances where the woman is swept away and saved my her hero,  this book has a heroine who saves herself time and time again.

4490901,2,B004X181TY,"For all of Mia Wasikowska's delightful acting, I was honestly expecting a great plot for this Jane Eyre. In the 1996 version, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough gave stellar performances in a movie that stuck so close to the book it amazed me. Even in the 1997 Jane Eyre starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds there was more liveliness and passion between the hero and heroine.

This movie begins near the end of the story. And then it brings in enough flashbacks to leave the viewer confused. My daughter and I waited for action that never came: like the more dramatic scene in the 1996 version where Mr Rochester suddenly appears through the mist and his horse is 'bewitched' and throws him. There is no scene where Mr Rochester tells Blanche to her face that the lady is only after his money. Also, there was NO 'fire' scene whatsoever, only a droll tale of Mrs Fairfax's version of what happened...

Regrettably, even the ending left me to see that 'yes, the characters have reunited' but as we true Jane Eyre fans know, in the XXXVIII Chapter: Jane says: 'Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present...' Such a scene would have done wonders for this rather passionless movie...

Scenes dragged on so that I wished for a powerful ending that was never to be! For, wouldnt the viewer have wanted to know that in two years, our hero Mr Rochester regained some sight so that: 'When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes... On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.'

  Can YOU imagine this 2011 version having such an ending? Don't alot of us wish! In all honesty, as Jane would say, this is not the best Jane Eyre movie.",1313884800,7,1798,4.568322981366459

4490905,5,B004X181TY,"The grandaddy/mommy of all gothic romances returns with sensation! Plenty of haunting scenery, subdued characters ready to explode, smoldering, restrained love story, and moody music to boot.

I've seen all the other versions and like them, more or less.  My favorites are the one with Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens and the one with Charlotte Gainsburgh/William Hurt.  How can one lose with this kind of material?

Mia Wasikowska portrays Jane as she should: independant, longsuffering, other worldly.  She's strong but vulnerable- a deeply wounded herione.  Yes, the actor is beautiful, but it's cinema, and they try to make her plain.  She's lost and crying for half of the movie, words far and few.

Michael Fassbender plays Rochester with sexy verve.  William Hurt was more noble; Toby Stephens more solid with a soft core.  Fassbender plays him more as a stewing nervous, needy wreck.  Beat down by the life he's seen and the burden he carrys.  He hides behind gruffness, teasing, and a threatening persona.

Judi Dench plays the concerned housekeeper, and all the actors are fine, but secondary.  This is a movie first and foremost about Jane Eyre and then about her relationship with her love.  It's a big order for Ms. Wasikowska, but I think she pulls it off.

The movie starts out about mid story, and then departs on two main tales from different time periods going on with flashbacks.  It's well done, and I didn't mind it.  Sure, there's parts and important characters I wish they didn't leave out, but there's enough, I think, of new to make up for it.  The ending stirs to a quick, subtle finish.  The shortest of all the versions.  After all that pain, more might have been better?

In the extras, they show deleted scenes- some significant.  And one can see different camps of thought about where this movie could have went.  One, more maudlin, the other, a horror movie, aka, ""The Shining- the prequel, the Jane Eyre years"".  Fortunately, cooler minds prevailed.

There's still plenty of gothic, thrilling, creepiness and plenty of melodramatic, emotional roller coaster ride to suit those of us who thrive on this kind of stuff.",1313798400,4,2143,4.932773109243698
4490906,2,B004X181TY,"Okay, I was thinking this was worth 3 stars until the end.  I am so sick of these movies getting Mr. Rochester's character so, so, so wrong.  (Um, is this is spoiler coming up?  I don't know, so I'll just say that, I guess).  Where was the redemption, the apology at the end?  Oh, I guess we didn't need it because he was so freakin' nice during the whole of this movie that he didn't need to be redeemed?  Um, no.  And he was way too nice through the vast majority of it.  Where was the changeability, the moodiness?  He's a manipulative jerk in the book while trying to make Jane crazy for him, but in this movie, he's usually an okay, if weak, kind of guy.  The movie did the double-talk of confusing Jane about Blanche and Bertha pretty well; the character just wasn't Mr. Rochester.  This movie made up a new character.  For pete's sake, he's supposed to be villainous - he lies and then tries to coerce the person he loves into giving up her core self, not to mention he's tormented and half-crazy himself.  He shouldn't be portrayed softly as a lover (or not exclusively so).  I was already annoyed that we didn't get to see his extreme disrespectfulness from the gypsy scene, because that scene really goes a long way to showing the reader how corrupt but redeemable he is.  But this ending really set me off, because it went against every reason Charlotte Bronte wrote this book.  We're supposed to see how he's changed, how he, not just Jane, can be happy.  All we see is that he's blind and got a crutch (nurse?  girlfriend?  mistress?  wife?  it's anybody's guess with this ending!)  This isn't a romance novel or romantic comedy.  You don't cut out the redemption, the significance, the lessons of the first 115 minutes.  If you do, viewers might feel cheated out of their time and money.  Hint hint.

Now that said, I could actually get through this interpretation, while most of the others, I can't even stand.  Zeffirelli's changes things so much and is generally dry (plus I can't get past Gainsbourg's braces!).  The Morton and Hinds version has Hinds chewing the scenery and playing Rochester as a one-sided meany.  Clarke and Dalton I barely remember as worth anything, and I hated the portrayal of Jane.  And one of these changes the part with the Rivers so much that it makes all of the themes of integrity, empowerment and redemption disappear.  This version had the opportunity to carry them out because it decently portrayed the Rivers' plot (except, why wasn't it acknowledged that the Eyres and Rivers were related?  Failure to read carefully?).  But it failed when Jane met Edward again.  The only adaptation I actually like is the BBC's 2006 version (well, of course I also like the Fontaine and Welles' version, but not for the portrayal of the novel so much as a historical film).  It's obvious this story can't really be condensed into a movie-theater production.

So, what can I say that's positive?  I really loved Wasikowska portrayal of Jane - it was spot-on.  Fassbender did a good job with Rochester as well, with the faulty material he was given.  The story, the setting, the characters, all that was good.  But the screen-writing and maybe directing as well was really, really bad (that's saying something for the actors that they could do such a good job with it).  My essential problem is just that the feelings and themes of the book just did not come through, and for that I'm blaming the script, even despite that it used actual dialogue from the book (which were its best moments).  And also as others have said, it does rush through the content while still seeming to plod boringly at times.  For that reason, it's probably inaccessible to viewers who have never read the book, but again, it doesn't stay true to the book's themes enough to satisfy those who know and love it well.  Not a good dichotomy.

So that's my rant.  Ugh, I'm so mad I paid $3.99 for this.  But at least it saved me from buying it.  I think I'll get my Kindle out so that I can wash this horrible ending from my brain and put it right, Bronte-style.  Thank you, Project Gutenburg for some much needed redempmtion there.  Can everyone else please, please just give up trying to adapt Bronte's vision?  It ends up being one-dimensional and trite over and over again.  Just stop.",1313798400,22,4298,4.595520421607378

4490908,3,B004X181TY,"Jane Eyre is at the heart of the novel, it bears her name and it's read through her eyes. Although I was a fan of the fresh way this was filmed, the interesting filmography and such, I was not a fan of Rochester. For as much time as they spent developing so many other things in the film, they did not develop him. He was cold and empty and two dimensional. Unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing such a creative and youthful approach to one my favorite books. The film focuses on Jane Eyre, she is very thoroughly developed and I could sympathize with Mia and her portrayal of Jane. But Rochester - if you don't know the story at all - would be nothing but a distant, strange man. It fits too closely into the overused realm of chick flicks - where the male part is developed only in relation to his love for the heroine. The real Rochester is so freaking complex and dark and sadistic. A man desperately yearning for salvation and mourning each day that lags on in his empty life without it. I have a hard time believing anybody who knows nothing of the Jane plot would understand and love this Rochester. If they do, it would be a shallow sympathy because the only thing we know about him at all is how desperately he's in love with Jane. And no real person's life and desires can be summed up in their affection for another.",1313712000,4,1341,4.325396825396825
4490909,5,B004X181TY,"I am a virgin to Jane Eyre, having never read the Charlotte Bront novel nor seen any of the multitudes of cinematic adaptations that were bore from it. Counting only the adaptations that share the same name, this 2011 version is the tenth film based on the novel, although several of the early ones are lost to time. This latest vision boasts a California-born director and an Australian and a German in the lead roles. Not the most likely people you'd expect for the adaptation of a thoroughly English novel, but once the film begins it quickly becomes irrelevant. It's with sadness that I realize how long I was unaware of the greatness of Jane Eyre, but with glee that it took this film to open my eyes.

For many, the plot of Jane Eyre may be a product of common sense rather than acquired knowledge, but I confess that I knew very little before endeavoring to watch it. For those like me, I'll attempt to keep elements of the plot brief so as to not spoil anything. The film opens with the present Jane Eyre (played by Mia Wasikowska) and allows the core of the story to unfold in flashback. Jane grows up an orphan, raised by her cruel aunt (Sally Hawkins) and is eventually sent to Lowood, a charity school for girls, with a rigidly sadistic faculty. Once she leaves Lowood Jane is invited by the sprawling, isolated manor Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall's housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) offers Jane a job as a governess over the master's ward, a young French girl named Adele. The mysterious master is Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender), who, after a short time, reveals himself at the manor. Despite his position as master and Jane's position as subordinate, the two strike up a rapport as equals despite there being something markedly sinister about Mr. Rochester.

Jane Eyre is directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, whose film debut, the Spanish-language Sin Nombre, was released to great acclaim in 2009. A Californian director of Japanese and Swedish descent may not be the obvious choice for this adaptation, but his direction is flawless. From the fade in, Fukunaga instantly captures the tone with a perfect dreary, gloomy look that creates the most effective kind of cinematic atmosphere. To simply label Jane Eyre atmospheric is to understate its effectiveness. It's enveloping and evocative, gaining your complete attention with its affirmed stranglehold on the essence of Gothic Romance.

A period drama typically emphasizes tone and character over simple narrative and with performances that are nothing short of hypnotic, this is no exception. Wasikowska is flawless as the title character, appropriately vulnerable but with a commanding sense of confidence. After rising to prominence in the billion-dollar hit Alice in Wonderland, she has steadily made her mark as an actress in much smaller films. She has the fame, but she seems determined to get the respect and thus far she's succeeding admirably. Michael Fassbender has also appeared in small, yet consistently great, films while flirting cautiously with the mainstream. Here, as in other roles, he has almost radioactive presence. When Rochester appears, he's not a suave, charming fellow but a blunt, formal, and stern man. Simultaneously, he does possess an intense, almost frightening, animal magnetism as well. Together, Wasikowska and Fassbender are fluent in the poetry of the dialogue and speak it with great fervor. Their performances are fascinating to watch and both have a command over the screen whenever they grace it with their presence. Meanwhile, Dame Judi Dench provides a quiet austerity to her role and gives a quiet performance that is no less impressive than her co-stars. Sally Hawkins, who has seemed incapable of playing a role without a distinct vibrant giddiness, proves that she can indeed inhabit a wretched character. The performances are more than Oscar-worthy, but due to how early Jane Eyre was released in 2011 it will likely be overlooked come voting time. Hopefully the Academy will avoid such a tragedy and keep this film in the forefront of their mind.

Elegantly is the only adverb that springs to mind when describing how this film was made. The subtle foreboding of the art direction by Karl Probert, the beauty of the cinematography by Adriano Goldman, the lovely music by Dario Marianelli that quietly accentuates each scene, and the complete control over visual style and consistency of tone that comes from director Fukunaga. The film, for two of the five senses, is a beauty to behold. Absolutely dripping with atmosphere, Jane Eyre is one of the best films of the year. A great story, marvelously told, expertly made, and beautifully acted. A gorgeous, compelling period drama that is completely accessible to a modern audience without ever trying to be.

Sure we can have favorites but come on, this was a highly entertaining, well acted, well directed, romantic specimen.  I have seen 2 other Jane Eyre films; Dalton's and Stephens.  All three are very good.  Cinematography was one of the best if not the best with this adaptation.  The development of the main characters was lacking but that does not prevent this from being an exceptional film.  Its primary downfall was that it was too short in length.  True romantics will love this movie.",1313712000,2,657,4.6521739130434785
4490911,5,B004X181TY,I have loved Jane Eyre since I can remember. This is by far the best version of the book I have ever seen. The lead actors are truly talented and make their characters leap off the screen. This is an extremely well done remake and stands out above the rest.,1313712000,2,257,4.16
4490912,4,B004X181TY,"I still have not read the book so I cannot comment on the adaptation aspect.  The actors are superb, though, especially the two main ones as Jane and Fairfax.  Judi Dench is of course excellent as always.  The enormous English country houses used are stunning, to say the least.

Jane leads a difficult and lonely life until she ends up a governness in a mysterious household with a dark secret upstairs.  This leads to much angst and conflict between her and her employer-turned-would-be-husband.  I won't spoil it any further.",1313625600,,528,4.876404494382022
4490913,1,B004X181TY,"I just finished reading the book last night and so I had to go pick up this dvd today. Well, I just finished watching this movie version of Jane Eyre and I did NOT enjoy it.  I thought this would be like the updated Pride & Prejudice but it's not.  It leaves out soo much of the story and it doesn't fully develop the characters so that you can't really connect with them.  This movie would only make sense if you had read the book.  The 1996 version of Jane Eyre (which you can stream on Netflix) is A LOT better. I like that this version is updated but it only scratches the surface of the book.  My advice is to rent it first before purchasing.",1313625600,17,647,4.103174603174603
4490914,5,B004X181TY,"...I think it's a winner! It's a good adaptation regardless of some of the more mysterious parts of the story being left out. This version has plenty of dark overtones for a gothic romance. I watched the deleted scenes that would have made the movie more like the book...I think the director didn't want to draw the audience too deep into the mystery, which is still present in the background. It might have taken away too much from the focus of building the tension and romance between Jane and Rochester, but you can always pretend the deleted scenes were part of the final cut. Also, I think the love story being more prevalent actually helps to add more shock value when the mystery is finally revealed. I am very satisfied with this modern take on 'Jane Eyre', and I am choosing to appreciate it for what it is and not criticize it for what it's not.

Wasikowska and Fassbender have excellent chemistry, and both actors are skilled at portraying subtle emotion; their passion is deep but not conveyed in an over-the-top manner. I wouldn't have minded a few more sexually tense dramatic pauses and kissing scenes, but I think we see a good amount of Jane and Edward's affection for each other, possibly more than any other film version.

I'm glad I own it, and I will watch it again and again! I highly recommend it!

p.s. Timothy Dalton's Rochester was very near perfect in the BBC version, and I think Michael Fassbender portrays Rochester perfectly for this modern albeit incomplete version...Dalton has the upper hand when it comes to sexy smoldering, though.",1313625600,8,1567,4.732600732600733
4490915,3,B004X181TY,"Overall it's not a bad movie, but it's far from good. Jane Eyre is a love story, a tortured and true enduring love story...this movie is not that. I've seen better versions, the 1943 Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine version has more feeling and depth then this. Shoot, just about every version I've ever seen tells more of the story and has more feeling then this. I've loved the dark and haunting story of Jane Eyre since I first read the book ten or so years ago, and I had such high hopes for this the latest screen adaptation of the novel, but I must say I am so greatly disappointed.",1313539200,3,586,4.288288288288288
4490916,2,B004X181TY,"Sorry...but Jane Eyre was an intelligent and very opinionated girl full of energy and passion.  This girl had very little personality at all,  not enough for a master to take notice of a servant.  Not even close.  I blame the director.  He seems to have taken more interest in Rochester's character while leaving poor Jane wondering around like someone had slipped a sedative in her drink.",1313539200,4,389,4.833333333333333
4490917,5,B004X181TY,"This adaptation felt very natural, with Jane presented as a dreamy, artistic, intelligent young woman who has a fortitude brought about by a childhood that was not kind but was not also overplayed. We are allowed to view her as if the most important things are about to happen, much the way it feels when young and venturing out into the world and relying on one's own character and strengths to succeed. She is more than the summary of a grim past and I very much like that she has finally been liberated a little from the demons of her childhood so that her own great beauty and simplicity shine through. For details, there are longer, more complete adaptations-personally, I'll just read the book again and enjoy that someone caught the spirit of Jane Eyre so perfectly. Mr Rochester, for once, was a rather sweet, if tormented man, and not so overbearing as to do a great deal more than prick the spirit of the girl into quick-witted response that shows her cleverness and his delight in her.",1313452800,3,996,4.601123595505618
4490918,2,B004X181TY,"How disappointing!  I waited and waited for this to finally come out, missed it in the theater due to its limited release and finally saw it on DVD the other night.  I was excited because it started strong but then it sadly went downhill very quickly.  There was little character development and even though I love the book, I could hardly wait for the movie to end.  The acting was superb but the adaptation was so weak the excellent acting could not even carry the story. Their love story just ""happened"" w/o any solid foundation or motivation.  So much so that if you didn't already know the story, you would have found it laughable.  I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that perhaps this story isn't meant for the big screen.  It can be dark and complex....very difficult to translate into a movie although there have been several adaptations that did a much better job of it than this movie(Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens version).  I'm sure Judi Dench was appalled to be identified with such dismal writing and/or editing.  Save your money and read the book instead. My poor husband sat through the full two hours with me!

Unless you've read the book then you don't fully understand the relationships between the characters. Why did they bother with this version. It's useless. I love Michael Fassbender but that's not enough to like this version. I hated it. this is not Jane Eyre as Bronte would have wanted it told. this is some bored individuals interpretation of what they thought the story was about.

4490921,3,B004X181TY,"First off, I am the biggest fan of Jane Eyre. I have seen all the adaptations, have several copies of the book and would claim it is my favorite novel of all time. That being said, I was severely disappointed with this adaptation of the novel. I felt that the characters were incredibly static and did not develop as they should.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender (him especially), however I felt that their performances fell short of the actual characters they were portraying.

There was little development as the movie progressed. The character of Jane grows from this meek and timid girl into this powerhouse of a woman. However, in this adaptation, she is not afraid to state her opinion and is bold right out of the gate. The audience cannot grow and push for her as a character if she does not develop as the story progresses.  Rochester is the same way.  In the real story, he at first comes off as a gruff and enigmatic person.  He changes though from that dark, brooding character into one who is to be pitied- he starts off strong and domineering and ends up the weaker of Jane and himself. In this version however, he is this character that is both gruff and tortured straight from the get go. He does not develop into being the weaker character.

Things just progressed at an odd pace in this film.  However I will say I did like the creative use of flashbacks to tell the story and the hints of things from the book (i.e. when the tree Jane and Rochester were standing under gets struck by lightning) without actually drawing attention to them.",1313193600,65,1601,4.557491289198606
4490922,2,B004X181TY,"Filmmakers: Before tackling the Brontes, Dickens, Austen, and other literary classics, it would be good to familiarize yourself with this audience. We have no problem committing our time and considerable attention span to these stories. In fact, we crave it.  If you short-change us, we will be irritated. If you meddle with the context or make some needless contrivance of modernity, or attempt to inject your own dialog on feminism or make other social commentary, we will look for the nearest open carriage door in which to slam your stupid fingers.  I didn't think we could sink any lower than the 1996 Zeffirelli JE, but this considerably worse. A key aspect of this story is the plainness/roughness of the main characters.  Jane is also meant to be very small due to bad nutrition as a child. Mia Wasikowska is far from homely, and through some trick of the camera, she usually appears 6 feet tall.  She'd have been better cast as Blanche Ingram, for heaven's sake.  Bad casting can usually be gotten around if the story is intact. This thing was little more than a slideshow. Utterly flat. Jane: Miserable/aunt's house. Jane: Miserable/school. Jane: Content/Thornfield. Jane: Miserable/on the moors. Jane: Hopeful/school, etc. Don't bother with this. Watch the 2007 Masterpiece version, which is wonderful despite its happy ending (none of them can resist this fatal flaw).  It's also worth seeing the 1997 version directed by Robert Young.  While the storyline gets chewed up a bit, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of the Rochester character is really wonderful.",1313193600,5,1562,5.101960784313725

4490926,3,B004X181TY,"I just watched this adaptation and I have finally reached the conclusion that this book is not suited to be a 2 hour theatical movie.  The story elements are complex and to fit it into a movie format compresses it so badly that too much is lost.  The compressions in this adaptation are jarring and the real development of the characters and their relationship is rushed and lost.  For instance, the first evening of the house party in this adaptation includes the visit by Mason and subsequently, all the despair Jane feels as the house party goes on is lost.  For those of us who know the book, we fill in the blanks without thinking but it is still not very satisfying.  Rochester is played well, Jane not so much - she is a little too confused for me.  The atmosphere and cinematography are wonderful. The end while intended to be very spiritual, is abrupt.  It really isn't the film makers' fault and it certainly isn't the actors faults.  This book just does not adapt to 2 hours in any of its movie versions.  So far the best I have seen is the Dalton/Clarke version followed by the Stephens/Wilson version.  Both are at least 4 hours and even so have to leave some elements out.  People who think this book in just a love story have missed all the other elements of class, morality, sacrifice, redemption, the faces of adversity, weakness and strength etc. And these elements can not be done justice in a theatrical movie format.  Good adaptation within its limits, but I will not see it again.",1313107200,4,1502,4.5427509293680295

I'd suggest the latest Masterpiece Theater version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson if you really want to see the story in its full beauty.",1313107200,20,482,4.393258426966292
4490928,5,B004X181TY,"I was initially concerned about the movie, because it's only two hours. I figured that there was no way they could include the level of detail in two hours that the book contained. Other adaptations had left a lot of important details out and this, I figured, would be even worse. Boy was I wrong! This movie is absolutely fantastic. I was SO happy that they really emphasized the bird theme in the novel. The wedding dress scene was perfection when Jane looked at herself and said that she was losing her name. And the film worked wonderfully to show how she didn't want to be his caged bird. I also loved how the movie began with Jane arriving at Sinjin River's house. It sucked me in and I think that the story worked so much better in film when it was shot in this manner. Perfect! The acting was perfect in this too. They embodied the characters exquisitely. My only real complaint was that they didn't really emphize Bertha's presence as much as in other adaptations. That said, I loved how that gave the whole Bertha ordeal a ghoulishness with the scene with the tapestry getting sucked into the wall. The novel shows Bertha as a kind of phantom that strolls the halls sometimes causing trouble, and this movie exaggerated that element. It was a pleasure to watch this film because even though it's short, it managed to pinpoint all of the major themes and elements of the book that are so important and that make it a literary treasure. I found myself completely engrossed in this. The roles were so well played that this was the first adaptation that made me feel the same way for the characters in the movie that I felt for the characters in the novel. Which is saying something because I'm a HUGE Jane Eyre fan. This movie is truly a treasure and I can't wait to get it when it comes out!",1313107200,5,1799,4.454545454545454

The acting in this adaptation was alright and the casting good,but I was alittle disappointed in the ending. I think it could've been longer. Why a movie like Inception (So BORING) was so long and a movie like this so short is beyond me. And they left out too many things that you see in other adaptations. I know they could not fit everything in 2 hours. I would've been more satisfied if atleast the ending was 10 or 15 minutes longer.",1313107200,2,577,4.401869158878505
4490930,2,B004X181TY,"As someone who has now watched every version of Jane Eyre that came to film via the big screen or TV, I was looking forward to seeing what yet another version would do with the novel to film and rented it as soon as it arrived On Demand. I was sadly disappointed. Mia plays a somewhat repressed rather than passionate Jane Eyre and Rochester is far too young, handsome and not very convincing as the hot tempered lion tamed by true love. Adele, Bertha and Grace Poole are minimally referred to. The storyline fell flat and left out numerous important scenes and details of the making of this classic.  Gone is most of Jane's important upbringing at Lowood School. Parts like the outbreak of Typhus and Jane's strong condemnation of enforced rules were completely missing. No names of the nasty Miss Scatcherd nor her beloved friend Miss Temple whose departure of the school spurns on Jane's boredom and desire to hire herself out as a governess are mentioned.  No attempt to mention St. John and his sisters are actually her cousins and why she truly wants to share her inheritance.  The scenes of Rochester courting Blanche Ingram are left out. No gypsy readings, no parlour parties, no Jane playing the piano to show her ""schoolgirl"" talents. Pilot the dog is referred to once!  And nothing of the famous scene where Bertha Mason comes into Jane's room, wakes her, shreds her veil and disappears in the night.  Again, a very odd and sketchy version of the story of Jane Eyre. A&E did a much better job capturing all of this in a shorter amount of filming time.  BBC did a masterpiece of the film starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  The rest fall in between. Other than some lovely gothic scenes outside and eye candy shots of the interior of an old English estate, this film lacked in every other aspect.  Even after the fire Rochester looks barely harmed and the film suddenly stops.  Where is the last chapter when the famous lines come in; ""Reader, I married him.""??  Anyone new to Jane Eyre is not aware of how he regained his sight enough to see that his first child inherited his eyes.  Anyone familiar with Jane Eyre and who know the book inside out are probably cringing in their seats wondering....where is the rest of the story? Where is the full background of Bertha and how he was tricked into marrying her and what he has sacrificed?  Where is the story behind Adele and her mother?

4490931,5,B004X181TY,"Though there have been many versions of Charlotte Bront's 1847 Victorian novel JANE EYRE the current incarnation as sensitively written for the screen by Moira Buffini and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga at least for this viewer is the strongest thus far. Much of the flavor of this production is due to the spectacularly atmospheric production design by Will Hughes-Jones, the appropriately Victorian musical score by Dario Marianelli and the fine cinematography by Adriano Goldman.  And added to the responsible staff should be mentioned  the casting by Nina Gold who has assembled a mixture of famous actors with a supporting cast of excellent neophytes.

The surprise member of the cast is Mia Wasikowska as the most fully realized Jane Eyre on film (and that is in the company of such greats as Charlotte Gainsbourg, Samantha Morton, Susannah York, Zelah Clarke, Sally Ann Howes to mention a few).  Wasikowska keeps Jane's focus clear throughout, never bending from her individuality nor her convictions.  She is completely believable in the role of a Governess to Ad&egrave;le (Romy Settbon Moore), a brave young outspoken lass to her evil Aunt (Sally Hawkins), a good friend to the housekeeper (Judi Dench), a responsible teacher for the missionary St John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his sisters Diana (Holliday Grainger) and Mary (Tamzin Merchant), and most importantly she stands up to her own coming of womanhood  to the harsh Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender).  The story weaves back and forth and in this non-linear style we grasp the real essence of how Jane Eyre grows into the woman she becomes - despite a wretched childhood with her aunt, her misery n the boarding school, and her sense of being a poor girl who must be in service to the wealthy.  It all works very well, even the treatment of Rochester's mad wife who dwells in the upper room of the mansion and haunts those below until she comes to an end.  Though the story does not end happily, it provides a very satisfactory concept of life in the Victorian era.

But sailing above everything is relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska in a powerful performance, equaled by her love interest Michael Fassbinder.  This is an exceptional film worthy of awards and wide attention.  August 11",1312934400,6,2262,5.002666666666666

The last screen adaptation was the 2006 BBC version and that was a stand out for me. But generally I think that unless a filmmaker has something special to do or say about this particular work, Hollywood might be wise to look to other classics for adaptation. However I'd heard excellent things about the most recent big screen version of Jane Eyre and after listening to an interview with the director on NPR in which he promised his new film played up the gothic elements of the story in a way that other versions hadn't, I had hopes that while it wasn't strictly necessary it might be darn good.

It's not. Not that it's terrible, it's just ""blah"". Mia Wasikowska was miscast as Jane. For one thing she's too pretty for the role. For another I didn't get  much sense of an inner life. Not that it was bad acting per se. She smiled at the right moments and cried at the right moments, but really I got no indication of an actual personality from her Jane. Michael Fassbender was OK as Mr Rochester but nothing special. The biggest problem there is that he and Mia have very little chemistry together. Also he proposes after what seems to be three conversations. We don't get any sense of any relationship there because most of significant events are left out. If I hadn't read the book I'd have no idea why Blanche Ingram was there to begin with!  I did like Judi Dench as Mrs Fairfax and Sally Hawkins as Aunt Reed. But Mrs Fairfax and Aunt Reed shouldn't be my favorite characters!

Small choices made by the the filmmakers bothered me. For example, When Mr Rochester proposes to Jane the whole part with the lightening striking the tree is left out. Bye bye foreshadowing. Another thing I disliked was that the whole first half was told in flashback while Jane was with St John Rivers and his sisters. I was hoping that the purpose of this was to cut down on the time that was devoted to a fairly dull, but necessary for plot, part of the story. But no. Even after the flashbacks end, bringing us back to the ""present"" we still need to see Jane with the Rivers' family for a while longer. And then, when she leaves (talking to Mr. Rochester's voice which she hears in the air, and looking like a lunatic) her return to Thornfield and to Mr Rochester is brushed over in about five  minutes.

When Pride and Prejudice was adapted in 2005 I complained  that looked more Bronte than Austen with it's wild, windswept moors. Well this looks more Austen than Bronte. Thornfield is a well lit house, and gardens are perfectly manicured (I thought the director said he was playing up the gothic elements!). It's worth a watch on DVD, don't get me wrong. It's not a terrible adaptation and it's pretty to look at. But I've seen much better.",1312848000,17,2832,4.487378640776699
4490935,2,B004X181TY,"I will not go as far to say I hated this adaption but I very much disliked it. (Which I don't say too often about movies). First off, I was confused the first 5 minutes of the movie because the opening scene is about the halfway point of the story. Then it goes into 'flashback' scenes as Jane is 'remembering' what happened. Second, the story line was very rushed, lots of information was skipped and many characters left out. Third, the acting was only so-so and lacked the emotions that the characters should posses. Overall, it was a weak interpretation of the book and I probably won't make the effort to watch this one again.",1312761600,5,631,4.495652173913044
4490936,5,B004X181TY,"I have been a Jane Austen fan for most of my adult life but have only just found(or rather, picked up) the story of Jane Eyre. Perhaps if this had not been my first foray into her story, it would not have touched me so well as other versions have for other fans. The dark and spooky feel the story had, the balance of willful and subservient way Mia portrays Jane so amazingly, and definitely the brooding and sexy quality of the leading man. I loved every minute of the movie and wish it had been longer. I watched it twice and will do so again before the 24 hour timer on my rental runs out. I hope they make a director's cut available, at which point I will purchase it again! Until then I will content myself with the dvd. This one's a keeper.

Edit: After mulling it over for a day I understand others issues with the end of the movie.  It does come about rather quickly and would have been better with a little longer resolution.  I still love the movie and will own it on release day.  Crossing my fingers for a director's cut....",1312761600,2,1037,4.222222222222222
4490937,5,B004X181TY,I loved this version of the movie. My all time favorite has to be the Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles version and this one is just as good.  I loved the way it was filmed; the sequencing and the flow of the movie were perfect. The two actors gave fabulous perfomances. I really couldn't have asked for more. I was VERY hesitant to watch the movie; I've seen Pride and Prejudice ruined quite a few times but this is wonderful.  Watch it. You'll be glad that you did.,1312761600,2,464,4.261363636363637
4490938,1,B004X181TY,"I have every Jane Eyre movie version available, as Jane Eyre is my favorite book of all time.  My favorite movie versions, in this order, are the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson and then the George C Scott/Susannah York renditions.  In these two versions you see the progression in the relationship and how they come to love each other, how they intrigue each other.  There is none of that in this movie.  I made the mistake of watching, again, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version a week or so before the viewing of this rendition.  And this one paled in comparison.  I had been so excited about a new version coming out, and ended up being so disappointed.  I never believed in Mia and Michael as Edward and Jane.  This movie needed more development time.  I asked my daughter and her friend to sit and watch this version with me and they both fell asleep, because it was so slow and boring.  I ended up apologizing to them for recommending the watching of it.  To me, there was no heart and soul in this version.  It was very lackluster.  In most versions, I myself end up falling in love with Edward Rochester -- not so in this one.  I know there have been complaints regarding the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version, but please give it a try.  There is humor, passion and sparks aflying aplenty.  I will say that I did buy this version sight unseen, so as to continue my collection.  After seeing it, I wish I had not.  One reviewer said the movie was ""bleh.""  I completely agree -- ""bleh.""",1312761600,16,1489,4.4888059701492535
4490939,2,B004X181TY,"Unfortunately this version of one of my favorite tales, Jane Eyre, falls way short. It feels forced, the acting rather bland and wooden. I love Fassbender, but I just feel like he was trying rather badly to copy previous 'Rochester' performances and failing instead of owning him. Jane was mopey, none of her cleverness really showcased, and the emotional moments felt highly ingenuine. An example would be the bed-on-fire scene. Dreadful. In essence, a dvd to be passed over if you're looking to own a great Jane Eyre. Try the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson undertaking instead.",1312761600,4,574,5.052631578947368
4490940,2,B004X181TY,"I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't any good for me (the great 2006 version of Janey Eyre puts this movie to shame). I was so bored watching this movie, it was rushed and not engaging at all.

There is very little to no chemistry between the actors who play the leads; Their lines are delivered in a very stilted manner, it's like they're reading the words and reciting them without any emotion (the viewer doesn't see or feel any romance in this version).  The ending is also very weak. They don't even show the fire in Thornfeild, but rather Mrs. Fairfax (who is the only well cast character in this movie) is the one who tells the story to Jane, and that's it (talk about a weak and anti-climatic ending).

In the end, this was just a boring, weak and stilted movie... disappointing.",1312761600,6,792,4.410958904109589
4490941,4,B004X181TY,"I thought both the leads were very moving in their interactions with each other.  I particularly liked Michael Fassbender as Rochester because he portrays an essential duality of his character.  He is the one in control (because he is the employer) and he plays it with a powerful personal presence while still artfully portraying helplessness in his situation and in his romance with Jane.  In my opinion, this aspect was played better than I've seen it in other versions.  The major flaw in this is the ending is not filled out enough.  The other omissions from the plot didn't bother me but had they added even 1-2 minutes to the final scene it would've been worlds better.

This is not my favorite version.  I think both Mia and Michael are too attractive for the roles, but their chemistry is amazing.  My favorite version is the 1983 version with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  It's more in depth in all aspects, and the ending is played out more fully than this one, leaving the viewer more satisfied.  Zelah amazes me.  Timothy amazes me (Rochester is much more interesting than James Bond :S)

This worst version in my opinion is the 1996 version with William Hurt.  Very forgettable.  Mia and Michael's version comes in at #2.  I've never read the book, but because I've seen so many versions, maybe I liked this one better because I was able to understand the glossed over parts.",1312675200,2,1393,4.698347107438017
4490942,3,B004X181TY,"This adaptation was just okay for me.  My problem is that I have recently seen
the Masterpiece Classic, 11 part adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's book, which,
obviously is much more developed.  However, for a 2 hour movie, this version
is perfectly adequate.  I would just rent the Masterpiece Classic version and
REALLY enjoy a thorough telling of a classic tale!  (PS...it is free with Amazon

I first fell in love with the 1944 movie with Orson Welles & Joan Fontaine. I was looking forward to watching this, I like the choice of actors & trailers seemed promising. I can say that overall, I enjoyed the movie. I understand that no movie will ever be able to show the entire story unless they want to make a 4 hour movie so I try to keep my expectations realistic. The actors were wonderful. The movie did a great job of making you like the characters & feel their desire to be together. Even though I know what happens, I still found my heart pounding the first time Mr. Rochester touched Jane's hand. This adaption largely focused on Mr. Rochester & Jane's relationship. My only disappointment is that we didn't see more of what Jane went through as a child. There are other areas skimmed over that I won't mention for those that aren't already familiar with the story. Perhaps just an additional 30 minutes added to the film would have allowed for these parts to be shown more. However, overall, I think this movie did the story justice & I enjoyed it.",1312675200,,1165,4.398148148148148
4490944,5,B004X181TY,"Almost ten years ago, when I was a senior in high school, I read ""Jane Eyre"" by Charlotte Bronte.  As a teenager, I didn't like to read, but during the summer of 2002, I opted to read Bronte's novel from my school's summer reading list, and I fell in love with Bronte and Victorian Literature.

Since my time in high school, I have studied Romanticism and Victorian Literature during my undergraduate years and my graduate years.  I had a very passionate 80-year old, Harvard-educated professor, who could preach at the front of the classroom about such writers as Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles Swinburne, and Dante Gabriel Rosseti.  My professor's words would transfix me; I was engaged, and I just absorbed every single utterance that would emerge from my professor's aged mouth.  Watching the newest version of this Jane Eyre film brought me back to my graduate classroom, especially, for as I watched the movie, I couldn't help to pull my eyes away from the television screen.

First off, it must be noted that the scenery is absolutely splendid.  The scenery is very reminiscent of the 2005 version of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which I so dearly love, compared to the Jennifer Jason Leigh version.  If we are to focus on the scenery alone, one cannot help not to be amazed.

As for the actors, they were superb.  Judi Dench nails her role, Mia Wasikowska is splendid, and Michael Fassbender's character, Mr. Rochester, is so beautifully played.  Mia's portrayal of Jane is something to behold; she is quite talented for a young actress.

As a viewer, I very much appreciated the fact that the movie closely matched Bronte's original work.  I admit that again, it has been almost ten years since I read the work, but from what I remember, the movie is spectacular.  Also, from a scholar's perspective, I really appreciated the bits of furniture that were thrown into the movie, which closely reflected the time period.  The fainting couch is one such piece, where women would come to lay on when exhausted from love, or even in a state of sensibility.  (For more about ""sensibility,"" read Janet Todd's work, ""Sensibility: An Introduction."")

Overall, from a scholar and a viewer's perspective, I loved the film.  My fiance, who adores history but is not a fan of British literature or British films, even liked the movie for its historical references.  All in all, it is a good movie, and I think it is something that I would share with my students if I were to teach a British Literature course, or even a Romantic/Victorian Literature course in the future.

My plea to you: Take the time to watch the movie, and even if you don't know much about the history behind it, you can certainly embrace the film for what it is--a love story.",1312588800,6,2759,4.780590717299578
4490945,3,B004X181TY,"I was a little disoriented when this version of Jane Eyre begins not with the child Jane, but with the governess Jane fleeing Thornfield Hall. If you don't know the story, you don't know why she's running blindly across the moors. Even if you do know why, you have no feeling for this Jane Eyre at all.

But after processing this dissonance, I could see the beauty of starting the story here. Frankly, I've always thought that the post-Thornfield part of the story with St. John and his sisters was a little long and dull. By fracturing this lengthy part of the book, this movie version deftly dwells on the drama of the Thornfield story.

This is a brooding and dark adaptation of the novel. That's a good thing, because it's a brooding and dark story. But I really missed the spark that should be in Jane's soul. As Jane, Mia Wasikowska has the resolve and the inner strength, but she is only given one line in which her sparkle surfaces: ""No, sir, you are not to be trusted at all."" Besides which, about a half an hour into the movie, I noticed how emaciated she is, with that big head look that painfully thin women unfortunately have, and I couldn't focus on the story as I would have liked. I don't know why this is today's conception of beauty. (See Keira Knightly in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement/dp/B0013XZ6X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement</a>.)

Michael Fassbender didn't do anything at all for me. Am I the only one who remembers the 1971&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-C-Scott-Susannah-York-version/dp/B00005Q4ED/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George C. Scott/Susannah York version</a>? It's still my favorite. It had all the elements of the novel and the characterizations were more complex. Frankly, in this new version, St. John seems like an abuser. That shouldn't be.

I became more disenchanted with the movie as it went along, until finally the last scene arrived, one that is delightful for its tender and witty exchange between Jane and Mr. Rochester, giving the reader/viewer the satisfaction of seeing the two roles reversed -- Jane finally in charge, drawing out the denouement, and the humbled Rochester's future in her hands. This version ends abruptly with a 30-second ""happily ever after"" scene, awkward kisses substituting for the dialog that enraptures the reader of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Eyre/dp/B004GHNIR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Eyre</a>.

I thought two hours might be too short to tell the story and I was right. The recent 4 hour BBC version is really amazing and after watching this crap I appreciate it all the more. The girl who played Jane Eyre was SO lifeless and dull that I hoped they had so butchered the novel as to have her die while wondering the moors. Rochester wasn't terrible but Toby Stevens (in the BBC version) is superb and vastly superior. The only thing in the movie worth watching is Judy Dench as Mrs. Fairfax. The Rochester/Jane relationship is so underdeveloped in this movie that there is more romance in an episode of the Jersey Shore and when Jane comes back to Rochester at the end of the film he looks less like our injured gothic hero and more like Val Kilmer playing Jim Morrison at the end of Oliver Stone's The Doors.

4490950,4,B004X181TY,"The book is so much better because it creates such a heroine who has so many trials, tribulations, values and essence. Also Bronte gave us the greatest romantic hero in Rochester. The love between Jane and Rochester didn't fall victim to passion's trap, it endured because of their compatability. So for that reason I was disappointed, for me the ending is so important. The depth of their love reveals itself, Jane is so accepting and playful. Bronte does what Austen never would --- give us the romantic scene and dialaog and the man's point of view instead of censoring them. So I didn't like the ending, it really felt like the director had run out of time and just stuck it in. Other reviewers have said that 2 hour was just not long enough, I agree, although I think the whole Rivers episode is a yawn and should be left out if possible (its a weak part of the book, who cares about Syngen Rivers and his boring sisters?) But the whole Lockwood story is really important to show how Jane develops and is both worldly and other wordly.

On the other hand Mia Waslowsky has to be hands down the best Jane Eyre I have ever seen on screen. She could have been a little fiestier but she expressed so much with her eyes. I felt like Fassbender was trying to channel Toby Stephens from the other adaptation. Fassbender was great in some scenes and believable and strong. But he was a terrible kisser! Lost all his sex appeal for me when I saw him with wooden shoulders trying to ""peck"" Jane Eyre.

Finally have to get to my favorite adaptations -- has to be Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine because Rochester is supposed to be scary. BBC one with Timothy Dalton is the best one for understanding the whole novel (as they hardly leave anything out), but the Jane Eyre in it is so annoying with all the foundation trying to cover her zits. And Dalton is too dramatic sometimes. Toby Stephens one is very good but doesn't use the great dialog enough.

So like my favorite all time Bronte Adaptation -- 1939 Wuthering Heights -- Merle Oberon, Laurence Olivier, the old black and white movie with the great actor wins hands down.",1312329600,,2121,4.503896103896104
4490951,2,B004X181TY,"I agree with other reviewers - 2 hours is insufficient. It seems like the movie is broken into 3-5 minute segments of the most important scenes in the book. It's very choppy, rushed, and doesn't really explain anything. If you watch this (and haven't read the book), you're going to wonder what the hell happened between certain scenes. I thought the cast was great, but the movie just didn't flow. If you're looking for a good adaptation, check out one of the BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions; they never disappoint.",1312329600,8,520,4.920454545454546
4490952,5,B004X181TY,"I have to agree that Jane Eyre is very difficult to condense into a two-hour movie, but Cary Fukunaga's adaption was amazing.  Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were outstanding.  In fact, I really think Fassbender was the best Rochester yet, very believable in the role.

IMO, a book is almost always better than the movie and movie adaptations usually fall very short.  In this instance, however, Fukunaga, Wasikowska and Fassbender came together and pulled off an excellent piece of entertainment.  I think Ms. Bronte would have approved.  I know I did.",1312329600,2,560,5.0989010989010985

4490954,1,B004X181TY,"You just cannot do this book in two hours - that's the most important thing to remember here. The feel of the film is RUSHED. Rushed, rushed, rushed. It's like viewing a dramatization of the CliffsNotes OF CliffsNotes of the novel. Seriously. It was like listening to an excited five year old tell you EVERYTHING about a wonderful day at the zoo. A jumble of elements rushing past you.

I'm guilty of dearly loving the book - I read it recently - that did NOT help me like the film! It's visually BEAUTIFUL... but if you love the book, this film will disappoint.

Plot elements were changed - some were eliminated. Dialogue was changed - unnecessarily. The dialogue in the book is sublime. Jane says things in this film that she NEVER would say - she only tells the reader in the book. The film should have had narration for those things.

There were some scenes with behaviors Jane would NEVER engage in. The film wasn't completely true to her Victorian values and character. Worst of all, the development of the relationship with Rochester - the love that grew between them - never was portrayed. Just taking the film on face value, one would ask why they decided to marry at all - why there was talk of love - when SO little was put into that part of the story.

Overall, this is probably the WORST adaptation I've ever seen of my very favorite book. I'm terribly disappointed. It's visually pretty and the music fits - but throughout the film, I kept cringing. You just cannot do this book in two hours. I don't recommend it.",1312243200,38,1529,4.509025270758123

So i decided to watch this since it has Mia from Alice In Wonderland. It was really really good. The actors were very good looking and handsome. I wish it would have shown a little more development at the end with the little girl and the mother. It would have been nice to know more you know? I really loved the scenes and the beautiful views you got they were just amazing, beyond anything i've seen. the flashbacks are a little bit to much, It's just a little bit scattered and sometimes hard to understand.

While not everything ran in line with the book, particularly a lack of emphasis on certain characters, it was beautifully conceived.  I loved how exacting the details were to the time period, especially in regards to how gothic everything was.  The casting was perfect!!  Fassbender is by far my favorite Rochester...the most likeable in comparison to other actors--most attractive too ;).  In some of the other versions I could not conceive of why Rochester was attractive to Jane.  I could really feel Jane's angst in this one...could feel her torment as she ran away.  Another reviewer mentioned that they felt Jane came across as weak...I definitely don't agree.

It was the only theater in the DC area that had it (E Street Cinemas on 11th street and E  downtown Washington DC).  That theater is amazing by the way..and if anyone is in DC and wants to see some amazing foreign or independent films you came to the right place. Be prepared to pay $10 for parking in their parking garage unless you luck out and find a spot on the street!.
The actors in this film draw you in and the theater was silent the entire time except for when EVERYONE cracked up laughing at some great British dry humor.  Rochester was so HOT!

BUY THIS MOVIE..you will not be dissapointed!  What an incredible love story!  I dragged husband to it once and he even liked it...but he rolled his eyes alot  haha.  It followed the book really well..with just a few minor changes that didn't detract at all.  The biggest change from the book is that they made The Rivers family... Janes Cousins and in that book that is not the case...that really was strange, but actually worked okay..just not expecting it.

After watching this movie, I feel like I have lived the story of Jane Eyre that I loved as a seventh-grader: Rochester is frustrating, sensitive, and passionate; the setting is gorgeous, desolate, and strange; and Jane is strong, open-eyed yet innocent, open-hearted yet guarded, and intelligent. Much is left out, but novel's themes come through gorgeously. This was the Jane Eyre I wanted to be when I was a young girl.",1311206400,11,664,4.928571428571429
4490961,1,B004X181TY,Jane is supposed to be strong and we are meant to like her. The actors fail to bring the characters to life and fail to get us to even like them. I'm a huge fan for the BBC 4 hours adaptation but this one sucks.,1311120000,16,211,3.7111111111111112
4490962,4,B004X181TY,"When I first saw this version I was initially disappointed because all my favorite quotes from the book had been omitted. Even the ending was missing one of my favorite lines.  Once I could over come that and look at the movie without my past prejudices, I grew to really love this movie.  As many of the other reviewers have stated, I too have see all the movie and TV versions of Jane Eyre and have read the book countless times.  What a joy it was for me to see the director bring something new to the interpretation. The Gothic feel and look to the movie is breathtaking.  I thought the two leads did an outstanding job conveying the passion that would have existed between two people from a different era.  Unlike the 2006 BBC version which was a cross between the vampire movies and Jane Austen, this one stays true to the intent of Bronte's book. Is this the definitive version of Jane Eyre? No, I don't think it is possible for anyone to capture ALL the complexities and intricacies of the book.  However it is a version that deserves watching.",1311033600,11,1052,4.453125
4490963,2,B004X181TY,"There was so much potential in this production but in the final analysis - disappointment.
This production with its out of sequence storyline and omission of parts of the book drag it down. The 06' version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stevens was and sill is my favorite.

4490964,4,B004X181TY,"""You would rather drive me to madness than break some mere human law.""

Thank goodness for high school literature.  That which was tedious and compulsory back then certainly came in handy today while watching this version of Charlotte Bronte's classic dark love story.

Although the screenplay required some basic knowledge of the original to sort through the flashbacks and shortcuts, and to fill in the blanks for the many omissions therein, the settings, costumes and Gothic creepiness were right on target.  Well cast and acted, Mia Wasikowska and Dame Judi Dench were up to the task, while Michael Fassbender seemed to be a tad cranky and rude at the times when he ought to have been going for ""cold and unapproachable.""  Never-the-less, he plays a reasonable facsimile of his character, despite looking more like Captain Von Trapp from ""The Sound of Music"" than Edward Fairfax Rochester.

The only disappointment for me was the amended, truncated and abrupt ending, which totally ruined one of the best parts of the book, and where I actually could have quoted some of the dialogue, except it wasn't there.

Recommended for fans of the classic looking for a good cinematic experience, but not for students looking for a visual CliffsNotes to help pass an exam.

4490965,5,B004X181TY,"Cary Fukunaga has directed an ethereal version of Charlotte Bront's oft-adapted novel Jane Eyre. The film's muted visuals convey the gothic story's mystery while hinting at its internal passions.

Our heroine Jane Eyre's (Amelia Clarkson) youth involves characters who resemble the grim child abusers in a Charles Dickens novel. The plot's pace quickens once Jane (Mia Wasikowska) reaches young adulthood and moves to Thornfield Manor, a forbidding castle surrounded by equally impressive grounds. There she encounters housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) and begins tutoring the lord's French ward Adele (Romy Settbon Moore). Mrs. Fairfax tells Jane that Lord Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) has moods that are as unpredictable as his travels. Jane feels drawn to Rochester, even though she feels that the more she learns about him, the less she knows.

Here Jane's renowned ""plainness"" comes from her soft features and downtrodden position. Wasikowska's youth contributes to the character's believable confusion and sexual curiosity. Most importantly, she conveys Jane's stoicism, wisdom, and imagination. Fassbender's Rochester is slightly frightening but magnetic, amusing, and acutely observant. He tells Jane that she is no more ""naturally austere, any more than [he is] naturally vicious."" She is as sharp, and correctly describes him as ""the most phantom-like of all"" her ""unreal"" experiences at Thornfield. Fukanaga brings out the novel's poetic language, making mere exchanges of words more intense and erotic than many a lovemaking scene.

Inspired by Northern English folk music and gypsy fiddling, Daro Marianelli's sweetly passionate score is haunting. Yet the film's painterly aesthetics, from a stormy sunset to the resonant final image, is the movie's most prominent aspect. While Fukunaga's attention to historical detail lends a realistic rawness, the movie's exquisite colors convey a fairy-tale-like quality, accentuating Rochester and Jane's allusions to magic.

Thornfield is alternately beautiful and menacing. A naturally-lit nude painting evokes a sense both ominous and sensual, much like Jane's attraction to Rochester. An individual who feels trapped is silhouetted against a window showcasing other worlds. Jane and Rochester are filmed outside in a way that makes them appear to be spirits of nature.

Wasikowska sometimes underplays the deceptively tame Jane, and Fassbender is occasionally too dramatic. On the surface, this is a straightforward if suspenseful adaptation of Bront's classic melodrama. But beneath is a rapturous, even transcendent tale.",1310083200,8,2593,5.7952755905511815
4490966,3,B004X181TY,"There have been several adaptations of Jane Eyre, and frankly the only one that has come close to hitting the mark has been the 2008 version with Ruth Wilson. Since the novel is so lengthy and detailed, the 2008 version does it justice by stretching its screen time.  And while I understand that film makers wanted to make a shorter version that's appropriate for theaters, the whole story of Jane Eyre seemed to be lost here.
For those who care about a movie sticking close to the book, this is not the version to watch.  With a skewed timeline, characters that seem to be too good looking, and a plot that was chopped in half, it was obvious this version was rushed. It seemed that the casting directors were also looking for that 'dark, tall, and handsome' man to be ruler of Thornfield.  The book clearly states that Mr. Rochester is not at all attractive, and Jane even tells him so herself.  Michael Fassbender was too  much on the goodlooking side. (But okay, that's nit-picky.  Most people enjoy a movie more with good looking characters.)

However, I must say this: if I watched this movie without any prior knowledge of Jane Eyre whatsoever, without knowing what should be happening according to the novel, or what the film makers were leaving out, I would say this movie is pretty darn good.  The cinematography is superb, and the language is true to that time period. The writers did not dumb down the dialogue for a modern day audience. That was much appreciated.

All in all, I'm split.  While the Jane Eyre enthusiast inside me is raging in disappointment from inconsistancies and incompletion, the Hollywood drama lover is soaking in the timeless love story.  If sticking to the story doesn't matter to you, then I would go ahead with this buy. It's beautifully done. But if you cringe when a great novel is destroyed, I would look to the 2008 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  That's where you find drama, cinematography, and a true movie adaptation.",1309651200,11,1978,4.701449275362319
4490967,5,B004X181TY,"I savored every word of the book Jane Eyre, it is my favorite by far. I have seen all the Jane Eyre movies and none come close to bringing the book to life as this one does. If you are a true fan of the book this movie will satisfy you like no other and if you have not read the book, well, you will still love this classic dark romance (who doesn't?). Mia played Jane so perfectly I wouldnt change a thing and Mr. Rochester...wow! Great job by bolth actors they stayed so true to the original novel. (PS I know Jane wasn't a nice looking woman but it was nice to see her a bit prettier then the older movies presented her).",1309046400,5,624,4.040322580645161
4490968,2,B004X181TY,"I have watched many versions of Jane Eyre over the years, and having read somewhere that Michael Fassbender had watched Toby Stephens' performance in the Mastepiece Theater version to help him as Rochester, my hopes were high...maybe too high. The Toby Stephens version surpassed this film by leaps and bounds and anyone who hasn't seen it should make it a point to do so.  I kept waiting to see and feel any passion between Jane and Rochester in this version...and never felt it.  It was as if they were just delivering lines and their characters were never fleshed out.  It lacked the passion and yearning that I have seen in other versions, and Michael Fassbender doesn't even come close to delivering a Rochester with  the depth and scope that Toby Stephens did.  I currently own 6 versions, and I don't forsee adding this one to my collection.  Anyone wanting to see a good version should first see the Mastepiece Theater version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens.  A close second, in my opinion, would be Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, followed by A&E's version with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds and then the previous big screen version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.  I own other versions, but have never watched them more than once...and I would include this new production among those that I wouldn't give a second viewing.",1308960000,16,1352,4.8478260869565215

The first part of the movie started out well enough, but by half way through, it just started to drag.  Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were wonderful as the leads...seperately!!  There were absolutely no chemistry or fireworks in their scenes together!  The ending scene in which Jane is re-united with Rochester was so abrupt and anti-climatic!  I was left with a feeling of ""Is that it?"".  My favorite version is the the Masterpiece Classic version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  That version was longer and it put me in a ""swoon"" for all 4 hours!",1308355200,10,683,4.836206896551724

It is a true adaptation of the book by all means and I actually thought the 2 hours length did not do it justice.  I am praying the DVD version will have a director's cut version in it that includes all the scenes taken out to fit into the timescale for public viewing.

4490972,5,B004X181TY,"I saw this in the theatre when it was released. I scanned the auditorium and saw one gentleman in attendance, typical for an Austin flick I suppose.  Before the film started a remarked to a lady in my row that I wished this would be different than the four versions I already watched that week.  I told her they should start it in the middle and tell much of it in backflashes.  They DID!  I was thrilled and very satisfied as this is a really original retelling of a very captivating story. The actors were well cast and I think the photography helped make it the best screen version. I confess that I only read the book once years ago and I do confuse the storyline with the 20+ adaptations. I think the story in this film is a good mix of all the plotlines. If you leave out the brutality of the Aunt's home or the Orphanage or Helen's death, you cannot imagine the depth of Jane's isolation. All the actresses, of course, were never as plain as the character is supposed to be, but this actress has an enchanting quality that endears.

The cinematography and music are beautiful and the use of natural light and candle light lend the appropriately gloomy gothic atmosphere.",1307664000,139,535,4.525773195876289
4490975,5,B004X181TY,"I just saw Jane Eyre and I was so impressed with how this version turned out. It truly was a bold vision. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska sizzled as Rochester and Jane. I also loved how the movie further explored the gothic aspects of the novel that previous versions have not paid as close attention to. The acting was excellent, not only from the two leads, but the supporting cast as well, especially Judy Dench, Jamie Bell, and the young actresses who played Jane as a child and her best friend Helen. The cruelty and abuse shown towards children at Jane Eyre's childhood boarding school greatly disturbed me. The movie also did a good job of making Rochester more of a sympathetic character. He deceives Jane, but because he loves her and does not wish to be parted from her due to social convention. I pitied him, like Jane, because there were no options back then for the mentally ill and I understand that he did not want to put Bertha in an insane asylum. This movie made me admire Jane even more because she stayed true to her convictions and respected herself. She may have been tempted to stay with Rochester, but knew that in good conscience she could not do so. When Rochester and Jane reunite in the end, I was brought to tears. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and now it is one of my favorite movies, as well.",1307145600,3,1337,4.461224489795918
4490976,5,B004X181TY,Jane Eyre is my favorite book & so I am a tough judge when it comes to the movie. I feel that they did an EXCELLENT job with this movie! I cant wait till it comes out on DVD so I can buy it. They stayed true to the book but my only complaint is that they did not show the scene where Mr. Rocheater dresses as a gypsy. They aso focused alittle too much on the most boring part of the book (when she leaves Mr. Rochester). Other than that the charachters did a great job with this one. I did not like any of the past movies expessically the one with the girl with the fish lips. Also the movie didn't end right..it didn't show the scene where Jane hands him his water and even though he is blind he knows its her. So All in All it was a great movie because the characters did a fabulious job but some of the scene they left out I thought were the best parts of the book. Even with out the scenes I thought should have been included it still out surpassed all the other Jane Eyre movies by FAR. See it you won't be sorry you did.,1305158400,3,1026,3.9138755980861246
4490977,5,B004X181TY,"If abandoned castles, gray storm-gathering English landscapes, moon-drenched love scenes, and tales of Romantic woe are your cup of tea - then my dear friend this is the movie for you!

I'm sorry to admit that I am no expert on the many adaptations of this novel, nor have I read the novel itself, but if this is so it is only because I did not find the earlier movie versions all that memorable and they never really inspired me to read the book, until now. From the opening scene I really felt that director Cary Fukunaga was doing something new here, something unique. In one interview, Fukunaga claims that he wanted to put more emphasis on the ""spookiness"" and ""darker sides"" of the book than any of the previous adaptations had, and that was precisely my impression. In fact one might argue (though I for one would not) that it is gloomy to a fault, with its constant brooding atmosphere, coupled with a hushed, wandering soundtrack that never takes flight into a conventional sweeping ""theme"" even in the happy moments, so I do understand why the person in the seat behind me fell to sleep half way through when I first saw the film at the theatre, sort of. But oh well, personally, I don't remember ever having been more alert during any of the Bronte or Austen films as I was in this one. I simply didn't want it to end! And I cannot wait to see it again.

For all it's gray clouds and dark candle lit rooms, there was one constant blaze of sunshine, and that is Mia Wasikowska, that stunningly beautiful, milk white creature fallen from heaven who plays Jane Eyre. Gorgeous and genuine, she immediately captured my heart. Casting her as Jane was, in my opinion, a stroke of genius.

Which is not to overlook the rest of the cast. Fassbender as Mr. Rochester, for example, was perfectly dark and mysterious yet passionate. You really loathe him at first and then grow to adore him.

The script was direct yet elegant, the costumes simple yet beautiful, the cinematography dark and monochromatic yet brilliant.

 It may not be for everyone, but this hauntingly beautiful film is bound to be a favorite of many.",1304899200,3,2118,4.58994708994709
4490978,4,B004X181TY,"I'm in the minority here, but I thought Mia Wasikowska was a huge disappointment as Jane.  She looked really lovely with shimmering tears in her eyes, and she had Jane's quiet presence, but it was otherwise an empty portrait.  Jane has such a vibrant inner life,  and such strong emotions and opinions and while there's nothing off with Wasikowska's acting - for most of the film I watched her not exactly sure what the problem was - her portrayal utters Jane's words but has nothing of Jane's heart or her essential self.

The film was really, truly visually beautiful - in the way that the Keira Knightley Pride and Prejudice was - and well shot, but the adaptation was much less skillful.  The 2010 P&P streamlines the book into the Elizabeth/Darcy love story and doesn't attempt to undertake the entire book.  Jane Eyre, not so much.  Charlotte Bronte's plot is clunky at best and presents considerable difficulties for a film adaptation, but the screenwriters were both too ambitious and too faithful to the book.  Too much time at the Reeds', Lowood, and the Rivers' bogs down the film, but it's not enough time to really tell any of those stories.  And don't even get me started on Jamie Bell as St. John.  I love Jamie Bell, but it's hard to believe him as the cold and unbending St. John.  He's somewhat distant but seems sympathetic for Jane for most of his time on screen, until he suddenly starts yelling about Rochester and temptation.

And the accents. God, the accents.  They're all British, but most of the time they're a generic British and then every so often the o's start stretching into infinity.  And I do not have a particularly good ear for accents.  Pick one, director.  Do the regional thing, or don't, but don't drive me nuts with the thick rural accents wandering in and out. If I can hear it, it's bad.

But for all the problems with the film (and they are significant), it deserves four stars on the strength of Michael Fassbender's Rochester.  He's amazing. He walked off with the film within minutes of his first appearance on the screen.  He's vibrant, quixotic - and too handsome, but not too much to stretch belief - and you can feel the force of Rochester's personality in every shot.  Fassbender is Rochester to the point that when I reread the book after seeing the film, book Rochester felt even more real, and he was already a character who jumped off the page.

It's difficult to sum up the experience.  As I left the theater, I was mostly disappointed.  My quiet 10 year old self felt really deeply for Jane and this adaptation failed her completely.  But that was eventually displaced by the powerful impression the film's Rochester made.  I'll buy the dvd, but I'll be fast forwarding through a lot of it.",1304640000,2,2749,4.641821946169772

I thought that Cary Fukunaga brought a freshness to the unfolding story line that was handled so profoundly.  The rearrangement of the story was surprising, refreshing and daring, and a good director like Fukunaga accomplished a continuity to the story without losing any integrity to the original.  Bravo.  Adriano Goldman did a beautiful job of capturing the majesty of the English landscape.  Such beautiful editing during the thunderstorm.  I went to see the film again for the storm scene among other reasons.  Mia really deserves recognition for this role and I know she will grace us again with more fine performances.

The book is dark and filled with gothic undertones that are sometimes (tragically) glossed over in older versions. This is not a Jane Austen novel, much as I love her. Sorry.

Gothic novels were dark and they were popular during Charlotte Bronte's lifetime, so it is natural that gothic elements would be found in her writing. The novel almost reads as a suspense, as Jane senses something strange about Thornfield Hall, and this film succeeded in capturing that essence. The cinematography was breathtaking. Jane was PERFECT; so much so that I feel she deserves an award of some kind for her performance. If you have read and loved this novel, as I have, I'm sure you will agree.

P.S. If you want a longer version of Jane Eyre which explains the story a little better (and has great sizzling chemistry between the leads) the 2006 BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is brilliant.

Ms. Wasikowska basically spends the entire picture walking around looking sad. It is VERY slow moving and there's very little character development in general. And to top it all off, the ending is very anti-climactic. There was an audible sigh in the theater at the end, as in -- that's it??? Judi Dench was a bright spot and there was some nice scenery from time to time. But that's about it as far as the positives.

The cast is fantastic, the scenery is beautiful and accurate, and the emotion will rock you to the very core.

4490988,4,B004X181TY,"When a story has been adapted for the big and small screen as many times as Charlotte Bront's 1847 Bildungsroman, ""Jane Eyre"" (nearly two dozen times since the silent era according to my count), there are bound to be some changes in hopes of setting it apart from the pack when yet another incarnation arrives.

In director Cary Joji Fukunaga's ""Jane Eyre,"" the story begins out of sequence. Instead of finding Jane as a child, living in the oppressive and abusive Reed household as we do in the novel, the film begins with an adult Jane near starving and near death. Once rescued from the bitter cold by the Rivers family, her past is revealed to us as a flashback. This sequencing makes for a very absorbing film.

Every shot of the film is so rich with texture, and composed in such a way that it could be frozen in time and featured in Grace Coddington orchestrated shoot for ""Vogue."" The authenticity is so exacting that at times you can nearly feel the fierce Yorkshire winds chill your bones. Costume designer Michael O'Connor shows appropriate restraint with the costumes (after all, our heroine is a plain Jane), but when his creativity is allowed to let loose, as it is with Mrs Reed and Lady Ingram, he produces some of the most exquisite period costumes I have ever seen captured on film.

The cinematography and costuming work most harmoniously together during the wedding scene between Jane (Mia Wasikowska) and Rochester (Michael Fassbender). Attired in her veiled wedding dress, Wasikowska looks so preternaturally beautiful-almost like a specter-echoing Rochester's description of her earlier in the film.

Wasikowska, seen last year in Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" makes for a wonderful, three dimensional Jane. She is forceful when it is required of her, but ultimately still manages to remain mousy, just at the character was original written over 160 years ago. Fassbender is a good and sympathetic Rochester, while Judi Dench is also standout as Mrs Fairfax, the housekeeper.

While some fans of the novel may be disappointed over some of the excisions for time, rarely have I seen a film that manages to catch the original spirit of its source material, while remaining unique and relevant in its own right, than Cary Joji Fukunaga's ""Jane Eyre.""",1301788800,35,2276,4.932114882506528
4490989,4,B004X181TY,"I have enjoyed most movie adaptations of Jane Eyre, because the story is so stunning.  This adaptation is especially worth seeing if you've never seen the BBC Masterpiece Classic Theatre movie done for PBS.  But once you've seen the Masterpiece Classic version released in 2007, all others pale in comparison...it set a standard that will be difficult to overcome.",1301616000,6,364,5.1525423728813555
4490990,4,B004X181TY,"An orphaned girl, raised in a strict girls school, matures and finds herself a maiden at the manor of an area gentleman. A relationship develops between the two. Unforeseen circumstances cause her to flee the home, where she is taken in by others, telling her story. This film is carried quite well by Mia Wasikowska, and the technical aspects of the movie are all outstanding. It doesn't contain the slow moments that these period pieces often include, so the viewer remains interested throughout. A solid effort here that is worth the time invested.",1301270400,8,551,4.935483870967742
4490991,5,B004X181TY,"Even though many have seen at least one or two film adaptations of Bronte's blockbuster gothic romance novel...there is still plenty of good reason to see this version.  I think that Mia Wasikowska's acting is pitch-perfect - maybe even the definitive characterization of this fascinating woman. She knows that she has been unlucky, but is intelligently waiting, watching, and analyzing everyone before she makes her next move.

The time and place - England's North country mid -nineteenth century.  Jane is unloved by her aunt, and after a fight with her cousin is shipped off - rather brutally - to a boarding school run by a self-important and cruel headmaster.  She develops one friendship there - a girl called Helen - but loses Helen to an illness.

The beginning of the altercation between Jane and her male cousin is nerve shattering as he bashes her head into a wall, and she (deservedly) hits him back. Of course - the aunt sees and hears only wants she wants to observe...and Jane is conveniently eliminated from the family.

During the prison like experience in Lowood School,  Jane becomes ""educated"" to serve the elite. After some mysterious circumstances, she secures a job as governess of a female ward of Sir Edward Rochester.  He and she develop an uneasy friendship at first - which ultimately blooms into love...as both have had very difficult pasts and need to repair their souls.  I enjoyed Jane's character telling the truth in a polite way when she tells Mr. Rochester at one point he speaks nonsense.

If I could offer one small critique - the early history of Jane Eyre is skipped over rather quickly. The meanness of the boarding school (Lowood School) is rather underplayed...and the necessary friendship with Helen is just a glimpse.  It is when Jane Eyre comes to Edward Rochester's manor house titled Thornfield Hall, that Mia Wasikowska shows her passion and thoughtfulness.  She is remarkable in showing just the right amount of wilfulness and submissiveness as an employee of Mr. Rochester - and just the right amount of beauty and plainness.  There are moments when the true yearning for intimacy of Jane Eyre is glimpsed - as, for example, when she secretly studies one of the erotic paintings of Edward Rochester at night by candlelight.

The cinematography is appropriately gloomy for the mood of the picture.  In summary, this is a very worthy adaptation of an important work of English literature. And for those interested  - the Penguin Illustrated Classics did a splendid job on an ""Illustrated Jane Eyre.""",1301184000,113,2548,4.96
4490992,5,B004X181TY,"It was so good, I went to see it twice in one day. Mia Wasikowska, who played Jane Eyre, and Michael Fassbender, Mr. Rochester, were perfect. I believed their love and suffering. I used to think that no one can do better Rochester than Timothy Dalton, but after seeing this adaptation, Fassbender took that spot. In other adaptations Mr. Rochester overshadowed Jane, but in this film Jane and Rochester are equal. I loved that dialogue follows the book pretty closely and it was not too modernized. Judi Dench was great as Mrs. Fairfax, and Jamie Bell was believable as cold St. John Rivers. Of course the scenery and costumes were gorgeous. For a 2 hr film director Cary Fukunaga did wonders. Highly recommended! Now I can't wait for the DVD to come out (hopefully with special features and deleted scenes).
p.s. I forgot to mention that the music score is lovely and fits the mood perfectly.",1301097600,205,893,4.730769230769231
4490993,4,B004X181TY,"I once saw that quote attributed to Jonathan Winters and it works for me and Jane Eyre.  Raise your hands all you guys who aren't English lit majors or otherwise had the book assigned and have actually read Charlotte Bronte's novel.  Me either, so although I've heard of Rochester for most of my sentient life, this very good movie was my first exposure to the whole tale.  And quite the tale it is.  Spoiler alert -- in the 19th century, people get their just rewards.  It sometimes takes longer than expected, is often not exactly as first promised, and is always, always circuitous.  But you get what you deserve.  And so with Jane.  Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the movie is making its star Mia Wasikowska, who I didn't realize was the daughter in The Kids Are All Right,  look plain.  She is a beauty and Jane's plainness is only accomplished through indirect camera angles and oblique lighting.  Hats off to the cinematographer for that and for the numerous scenes of the moors' beauty.  Director Fukunaga tells his tale with fluid, occasionally confusing flashbacks.  He has Judi Dench on board as Rochester's housekeeper, always a welcome if sometimes hammy development.  It takes the better part of an hour for Jane Eyre to launch, but once it does, in a scene where Jane causes Rochester's horse to start, throwing him, all the rest is very entertaining.  And enables me to continue to miss the book.",1300406400,23,1420,4.762295081967213

The direction of this film is really stunning, the score is heartbreakingly gorgeous, and the acting is spot-on. There are some adjustments from the book, but all the changes they made were to the movie's benefit. It's a perfect run time and flows nicely. This is certainly one of Fassbender's best performances, and I've seen quite a few of his movies. I really like Wasikowska, I think she does a fantastic job as Jane and is an underrated performer in general.

And while I like each of these actors separately, there was no chemistry between them.
