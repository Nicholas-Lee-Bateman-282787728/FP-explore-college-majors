2829656,2,B000Q66FB6,"I relied upon a usually very trustworthy movie review service before deciding to take my kids to this movie.  I am still cringing, 3 days later, at some of the issues this movie brings up.

This movie has two characters, a science teacher and his fiance, both of whom are heavily into all things mystical and New Age.  Far more distressing, though, is their relationship:  they are shacking up.  They take vacations together, they share a bed, we see the science teacher walking around wearing only a shirt and underwear (at first, looks like he is naked below the waist).  The fact that they are shacking up is so irrelevant to both character development and plot that I have to wonder why they weren't simply depicted as mister and missus.

This science teacher also sports an earring (I know, lots of guys do it now, but this review is aimed at more traditionalist movie-goers).  Worse still, he tells his class that it's dangerous to ""screw"" with DNA, then tells his class not to tell their parents he used the word ""screw.""  While it may be a small thing using the word ""screw"", an authority figure has no business telling children to keep secrets from their parents!!!

The movie's heroine is a gifted 5-year-old girl, who forms a strong attachment to the mysterious bunny named Mimzy, and becomes distressed when she realizes that Mimzy may be dying.  This may be more than sensitive young children can handle, and left my 5-year-old daughter weeping and tearful long after the closing credits.

Would that we could time-travel our way back and skip the movies that day!",1174867200,8,1577,4.736263736263736
2829657,3,B000Q66FB6,"In the future, we will sit around in fields full of wildflowers, wearing see through Crocs. That is, if ""The Last Mimzy"" can save the world.

Directed by Bob Shaye (the top head of New Line Cinema) and co-written by Bruce Joel Rubin (""Ghost"") and Toby Emmerich (brother of the President of New Line Cinema, who reports to Bob Shaye), ""The Last Mimzy"" is a strange film. Many things about it are interesting and good, many things are not.

Noah (Chris O'Neil) and his younger sister, Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) travel with their mother (Joely Richardson) to the family's cabin on an island in Puget Sound. It is spring break and the kids are anxious to get away, play on the beach, and have fun. Dad (Timothy Hutton) has to stay behind for a few days to deal with a big case at his law firm. The first day there, Chris grabs his boogie board and wet suit and attempts to brave the cold water. But the kids notice a large box shape floating in the water. They retrieve it and quickly realize the box is covered with strange markings. It opens, revealing some strange items; rocks, a seashell with strange deposits, a stuffed rabbit and more. Emma realizes she can make the rocks float and once they are floating, they form a sort of strange force field. The rabbit also starts talking to her, telling her what she needs to do. As they start to uncover the mysteries of the items, Noah's science teacher, Mr. White (Rainn Wilson, TV's ""The Office""), realizes some of Noah's old drawings resemble 12th Century Tibetan mandahlas. Before too long, the local director of Homeland Security, Mr. Broadman (Michael Clark Duncan) becomes interested in this small Seattle family.

One of the good things about this film is the two child actors. Given they are in virtually every scene of the film, it is amazing they are as watch able as they are. I would expect them to be very precocious and sickening, but they are very real and believable. Noah is not very talkative at home and simply ignores his dad when he learns he will miss part of their spring break. He loses himself in his video games and fights with his sister. His sister naturally idolizes her older brother, despite his attitude towards her. Yet, as soon as they arrive at the family cabin, on the lake, they are best friends and running happily into the surf. When the problems mount, they work together to solve the mystery and make sure everything happens. Emma is also good. She plays the violin and states she doesn't have many friends, because they think she is too weird and too smart. This is a very real reaction at this age and makes her seem real. When the two begin learning the secrets of ""The Last Mimzy"", they uncover elements with the natural curiosity of a child. Both Chris Wilder and Rhiannon Leigh Wrynn are remarkably good, even more so given they are in virtually every scene of the film.

Rainn Wilson is good as Mr. White, Noah's slightly hippy-ish science teacher. He seems like the type of guy you would want to have as a teacher. Interesting, fun, intelligent. He knows what he is talking about and isn't afraid to get involved in the kids lives. There is a scene in which Mr. White and his fianc&eacute;e (Kathryn Hahn) stop by to talk to Noah's mom (Richardson). They are very respectful and tread carefully with the information they have. This is also very believable and helps to show how much these two characters are in tune with one another. Throughout, this couple has an amusing exchange about dreams, providing a few laughs throughout.

Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson are also good as the parents of Emma and Noah. Throughout, they seem to react in natural, believable ways to the situations their children encounter. They are scared, supportive, amazed at various points throughout.

The big problem in ""The Last Mimzy"" is in the filmmaking. Director Bob Shaye has crafted an interesting film, but it seems low budget, despite the use of some interesting special effects. All of the action takes place at a small handful of locations, most of which are confined and sparsely populated. It is convenient that a significant portion of the film takes place at a family cabin, they don't have to interact with a lot of other people, which would mean hiring extras to fill the surroundings. Extras cost money. During the vacation, Noah and his dad go to a driving range, yet this is only about a quarter full. Aren't there other people on this island? Even when the kids are at school, we never see anything other than Noah's classroom. During a science fair, there are approximately thirty people in attendance.

The special effects are good, but they are small, emanating from small objects or areas. The larger the special effects, the more costly. Because they are small, they can contain the costs.

All of these elements point to a film under strict budget control. That, and the fact the actors are not name actors, mean this film probably didn't cost a lot of money.

Saving money, in and of itself, doesn't make this film a bad effort, but the plot holes are another matter and detract more significantly from the story. At one point, Broadman, turns to the parents and says ""I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?"" When the parents respond ""No"", he let's them go. I'm sorry, but given what he just saw, this would never happen. At the very least, he would haul the family in for observation and ask more questions. Trust me, this is a huge plot hole. It is almost as though the film ran out of money and needed to tie up the plot, no matter how sloppily, or loosely.

When the reason for ""The Last Mimzy"" is revealed, it seems a bit New Age-y, a bit trippy. That, and the scenes of people sitting amongst wild flowers wearing orange and red kaftans, makes me think perhaps Rubin and Emmerich were writing this screenplay as they came down from a pot induced high. I can imagine people smoking a joint and going to this film and really tripping on the story and the visuals. I probably just sold some tickets.

But for people who are watching this film  fully cognizant of their senses, it will seem a bit outlandish and unbelievable.

""The last Mimzy"" is an unusual, interesting film with two very good performances by child actors, with a good, but far too simplistic message and the film seems more appropriate for the Disney Channel.",1174780800,3,6347,4.626110124333925
2829658,5,B000Q66FB6,"I took 4 kids,(two 7,and two 12 year-olds) to this movie.  We left entranced and filled with hope.  With Global warming, pollution, war, and everything else looming over us, this movie was just what we needed to feel that there is hope.  My son was happy because both the boy and the girl had important roles, they had to work together, their skills were different but vital for saving the world.  Touching and sweet, some sit on the edge of your seat scenes, adults who make mistakes yet come around, and a movie I can take 1st graders and 6th graders to.  The best movie experience we've ever had in a theater.",1174780800,7,612,4.428571428571429
2829659,3,B000Q66FB6,"In fact, I did like it, while I was watching it. Cute little kids, evil Patriot Act guys, cute stuffed bunny - who could dislike any of that?

But when the lights came up in the theater, my suspended disbelief came crashing down. Oh, I could go along with all the science fiction premises easily enough. That's the ""What If?"" part of the story, and well done. Mystical powers granted to children by carefully disguised tokens from the future - that works for me. But after ""What If?"" comes ""And Then,"" and that's where it kind of fell apart. I'm not going to given any spoilers, but the big dramatic tension in the end wasn't really resolved, it was just abandoned.

So, it's a fair way to spend an evening. But that's all.

2829660,5,B000Q66FB6,"If parents are looking for an excellent movie for their children to watch - then The Last Mimzy is a perfect choice. It portrays two children showing true courage to face the unknown! It proves filmmakers can make an interesting film with zero violence! And surprisingly, the youngest actress, who must be around six years old is, by far, the most talented in the entire movie!

From an adult's point-of-view, this movie has numerous shortcomings: its slow start, the over-the-top product placement, and too many two-dimensional characters.  But what saves this film is its very original premise: The time travel of  a living machine, from the distant future, is necessary for the survival of the human race! Other pleasant surprises is music by Pink Floyd, the very clever mention of Lewis Carroll's Alice from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and the brilliant inclusion of Tibetan Buddhist Mandalas!

If The Last Mimzy had a much bigger budget, it would have been a  masterpiece, like E.T.! This is a very, very clever story, which could have been a blockbuster if  it had more special effects, better acting talent, and longer run time for a bit more character development! Early on I was going to get up and leave the theater, but I'm glad I was patient. Once The Last Mimzy started to move along it turned out to be a delightful story, well worth my time!",1174780800,,1351,4.801724137931035
2829661,5,B000Q66FB6,"What we have here is a splendid sci-fi oriented family film good for all ages.  Ok, maybe 5 year olds won't ""get it"" like older kids and adults, but it won't hurt them to watch.  It is rated PG.  I was really awestruck by the performances from the children, particularly Rhiannon Leigh Wryn, who played Emma Wilder.  She had me tearing up more than once during the movie.  I don't know how she did it so effectively; she delivered a flawless and highly evocative performance, oozing cute throughout the film.  Made me feel like a kid again.  So what was the movie about you ask?  The two kids find an alien artifact on the beach and it opens for them.  It contains some really amazing stuff that nobody is sure about, and the kids try and keep it secret, but slowly they learn more about it and, in the end, find out what needs to be done.  The special effects are neat, and the story is interesting.  It contains a healthy portion of mystery.  If you see it without the intent on slamming the movie and keep an open mind and a light heart, you will probably love The Last Mimzy.",1174694400,3,1079,4.313432835820896
2829662,4,B000Q66FB6,"My wife, myself and my 14-year-old daughter caught a ""Sneak Preview"" of this film.  We went on a last-minute whim, but overall we were very glad we did.  THE LAST MIMZY is far from the greatest movie made, or even of the year...but it also fills a niche that needs to be filled with something of quality.  And that is:  a movie for older kids / tweens that isn't a) noisy, computer-generated animation [such as HAPPY FEET or FLUSHED AWAY or b) primarily fantasy-driven such as NARNIA or ERAGON.  Now, the movies I list above may or may not be good...I'm not judging their quality.  I'm just saying that these tend to be the only kind of movies that come out for children of a certain age.  THE LAST MIMSY plays a little bit like E.T. meets THE X-FILES.  It has moments of childish cuteness (but never lapses into out and out silliness) but it also has moments of intrigue and suspense that come from the best sci-fi movies.  It has a mystery that actually manages to generate interest.  It isn't hard for an adult who has seen a lot of movies to guess fairly quickly what ""Mimzy"" and her fellows ""toys"" have come to earth to do...but I have to admit watching the film put the puzzle together was fun...even if I knew where it was going.

We see the film primarily through the eyes of the brother and sister who find Mimzy (a stuffed bunny) and some other objects floating in the ocean.  We discover the uses of these items pretty much as the kids do.  And the two kids were very nice characters.  They aren't obnoxious, smart-mouthed kids.  They were actually thoughtful and fairly polite.  They weren't brilliant students nor brilliant atheletes.  Just ""normal"" kids (who come from a VERY privelidged backgound, I must say).  As brother and sister, they conspire together against their parents, they clearly love each other...and yet the bug each other as only siblings can do.  I enjoyed these young performers very much, and appreciated the care with which they were written.

Their parents, played by Joely Richardson and Tim Hutton, were not fleshed out as well, and the two actors didn't do a whole lot to help the roles.  Hutton is a typical overworked and underinvolved dad, and Richardson is a stay-at-home mom who stills manages to spend very little time with her kids.  My favorite adult, by far, is the teach played by THE OFFICE'S Riann Wilson.  I'm glad to see ""Dwight Schrute"" with a chance to play a character with no ""evil"" edge.  He's still a bit daffy and a bit ""new agey,"" but the film has lots of fun with that, and Wilson does an effective job.  Michael Clarke Duncan is the other familiar face, playing a zealous member of Homeland Security.  His part is underwritten, but Duncan is always a presence to be reckoned with...and not just for his size.

The movie has nice special effects.  It isn't some huge budget affair, but the effects it does use are totally convincing.  It has a leisurely but never boring pace.  It FEELS like a book for youth...at least a good one.  It doesn't talk down to youngsters, but it doesn't try to make them feel like their watching a movie that's really for adults.  There's no bad language, no ""sensuality"" and nothing super-scary.  I think young kids (say, under 10) might have trouble following it.  In my opinion, the ideal ages would be from 11-15.  That's a small target audience, and thus I imagine the film won't be a blockbuster...but it does hit that target well.  We talked about the movie all the way on the drive home, which is a rarity...and we felt it was 95 minutes well spent indeed.

And for us parents, there was a new song from Roger Waters of Pink Floyd.  That was an unexpected surprise.

So, don't expect the film to win Oscars or even generate huge buzz.  But don't deprive kids of the right age a change to enjoy something a little bit different...and something that is intelligent.",1174348800,5,3864,4.575801749271137
2829663,2,B000Q66FB6,"""The Last Mimzy"" is one of the most frustrating movies to come out this year.  How can a movie with so much potential, such an intriguing build up, and ingenious special effects feel like one of the most compromised bores in recent memory?  I know science fiction and children's entertainment don't exactly mix well.  Science fiction is usually dark, cutting edge, complicated stuff that involves technology to create much of the conflict.  Some of the most memorable science films include ""The Matrix,"" ""Blade Diamond,"" ""Star Trek,"" and the ""Star Wars.""  For the most part, these are not children films.  Children films are normally lighthearted, fun, and goofy.  Everything science fiction is not.  Oh, but ""The Last Mimzy"" sure feels like it contains a stunning sci-fi movie in here.  The problem is we don't quite find it here.

The story of ""The Last Mimzy"" starts out as a typical children film.  The movie revolves around Noah and Emma Wilder (Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn respectively), two kids who are frustrated with their lives.  Noah suffers in school, Emma doesn't appear to make friends easily, and they have a work-a-holic dad (Academy Award winner Timothy Hudson) who appears to be working so much that the mother of the house (Joely Richardson) is the one REALLY taking care of the family!  Then one day the kids find a chest in the ocean near their house, a chest that contains rocks, a green stone, and a stuffed bunny (among other thing).  Noah takes a liking to the shinny, green rock while Emma falls instantly in love with the bunny.  Ah, but there is something not quite right with this stuff.

For started, no adults can see the green rock shimmer and align the stars, while the bunny makes some sort of squeal when around Emma, who claims the bunnies name is Mimzy and that she speaks.  Well kids will be kids right?  No one says anything, but it becomes harder and harder not to be freaked out when the kids start moving rocks, dissolved their hands into little micro bytes, and talking to stuffed bunnies.  Like most kids in kids movies, the two kids start playing with their new powers without much fear or caution, but with a sense of fun.  A turning point comes when playing with some rocks results in a blackout that covers half of Seattle.  Noah's science teacher, a Buddhist named Larry (Rainn Wilson), is the only adult who questions whether or not Noah has special powers.

He bases his suspicions on some doodles Noah scribbles in his text book, which really turns out to be symbols from some ancient religion or something.  All of this sounds interesting, and indeed it should be, but the movie holds back.  The movie throws us suspense and wonder, but it doesn't quite know what to do with it.  Sure the kids can make rocks spin, but how will that help them with anything?  The kids make these rocks spin several times during the movie, yet nothing seems to come from them.  Even if this is cool the first time around, I assume it wouldn't be as cool the fifth and sixth time around.  The kids play with these powers, but the movie doesn't really do a good job of explaining how they are able to spin rocks and speak to spiders all of a sudden.  Mimzy the bunny seems to be the key to all this, but Mimzy does nothing.

In fact, it's safe to say that almost nothing happens in this movie.  Noah has a dream sequence that involves a brilliant scene where a crystal bridge gets built, but no such bridge does get built.  It makes me wonder what the point of the bridge was at all.  The movie also holds back with the adults.  The mother asks her husband whether or not the family should get help.  The father asks what kind of help she had in mind.  I point this out because this is a good question.  So far we've gotten no indication whether or not what the kids are doing is good or bad.  There is a surprising lack of conflict because of this.  People react to the strange things they see, but that's about all they do.  Nothing ever comes from these reactions, except for the occasional joke, which keeps the movie from being too serious.

The movie also seems to be stretching itself thin for drama.  Case in point: Emma loves Mimzy, but she loves her to a point that is unhealthy.  At one point the parents take Mimzy away and Emma cries.  This I can understand.  At one point the parents ask her to put Mimzy down for five minutes and Emma cries.  This is just annoying.  She cries over Mimzy seven times in this movie, each time becoming more annoying then the next.  Since we cannot hear Mimzy, we shouldn't be expected to side with Emma when it's time to put the toy away for a few minutes.  But all the ideas, computer graphics, and questioning, ""The Last Mimzy"" ends with no sense of accomplishment or purpose.  None of the ideas here are fully developed, the history behind Mimzy is murky at best, and the adults seem to be reacting with one liners instead of wonder.

While I don't doubt there will be kids who get sucked into this movie, there's going to be far more people who walk away frustrated by the lack of depth and clarity.  The tagline for this movie is ""The Future Wants To Tell Us Something.""  Well, if the future wants to tell me something, I know I'm not going to get that message from this movie.

Rating: ** and a hlaf stars",1174176000,8,5301,4.495287958115183
2829664,5,B000Q66FB6,"I, my son(17), niece (11), nephew(14) and my sister enjoyed this movie very much. We all delighted in the professor and the two children who really headed this movie. This is a fun uplifting movie for the whole family to enjoy.",1173744000,2,227,4.560975609756097
2829665,3,B000Q66FB6,"Here is a passage from Lewis Padgett's short story ""Mimsy were the Borogoves"": ""It is difficult to admit that children lack subtlety. Children are different from mature animals because they think in another way. We can more or less easily pierce the pretenses they set up, but they can do the same to us. Ruthlessly a child can destroy the pretenses of an adult. Iconoclasm is a child's prerogative."" I'm taking the time to quote this passage because it perfectly sums up what does and does not work about the film adaptation, ""The Last Mimzy,"" a family oriented science fiction fable. On the one hand, the children in this film are effectively portrayed as being misunderstood, with the majority of the adult world unable and/or unwilling to believe them. On the other hand, these characters were both underdeveloped and over-dramatized; I never believed for a second that their dialogue was in any way, shape, or form plausible.

In all fairness, the story for ""The Last Mimzy"" is a fascinating idea: a brother and sister duo from Seattle--Noah (Chris O'Neil) and Emma Wilder (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn)--stumble upon a mysterious box and find that its contents utilize otherworldly, magical technologies. Through secretive experimentation, they become unnaturally intelligent: Noah learns to manipulate sound waves in order to make a spider spin an impossibly intricate web; Emma can bring forth a temporal window by throwing a set of special stones. She then finds a rabbit doll in the bottom of the box, and she quickly discovers that it can communicate with her. Purring in a language only Emma can understand, the rabbit tells her that her name is Mimzy, and she's been sent from the future to plead for help. A race of beings from that distant time is dying, and only something special from the present can save them.

Yes, this is a good story. If only it had been developed into a better film, one that didn't seem incomplete and, at times, highly implausible. This is not a bad film by any means, but it definitely could have been something much more. It seemed as if the filmmakers were trying too hard to make a family friendly adventure, so much so that they inadvertently confined it within a sterile, sappy, underdeveloped narrative. Some people, especially children, will enjoy this movie because it sure is pretty to look at; there are a number of impressive digital effects, and a couple of key scenes are played out well. But these elements are purely superficial, and they don't add up to a meaningful experience. Part of the problem is that the characters weren't clearly defined; I didn't feel anything for Noah and Emma because they weren't relatable, even before they discovered the futuristic toy box.

As their minds continue to expand, their parents (Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson) grow more and more concerned. This is especially true of their mother, a woman so flustered and close-minded that her screen presence was more annoying than appropriate. Only such a character would immediately believe that something's wrong with the children, that they must seek professional help before anything terrible happens. True, Noah can manipulate spiders and create miniature wormholes. True, Emma can listen to a stuffed rabbit and literally peek into the future. Nonetheless, I did not see anything ""wrong"" with them, or at least nothing that would make their mother behave so irrationally.

Noah eventually begins making sketches in his notebook, specifically sketches that perfectly copy ancient symbols of the universe. This attracts the attention of Larry White (Rainn Wilson), Noah's science teacher. He's lately been having strange dreams that he cannot explain, yet he seems to know that they connect with Noah and his toys. All this gives his holistic fiancee, Naomi (Kathryn Hahn), reason to push him into being a kind of Special Child Investigator; she believes that something wonderful is on the horizon, and he can't simply let it go. Here are characters that were added for nothing other than comedy relief, which I found incredibly inappropriate. It's bad enough that they have to bicker about topics that are meaningless to the plot; Naomi hasn't gotten over the fact that White failed to act after having a dream about winning lottery numbers.

When Noah sticks a glowing glass sheet into a blue, gel-like substance, he unintentionally causes a severe blackout, bad enough to leave half of Washington State without power. Thus enters an anti-terrorism unit led by a former government agent (Michael Clarke Duncan). A blackout of such magnitude originated from a residential area, which they find more than a little suspicious. And so, the family is rounded up and taken to a secret location, where the obligatory questions will be asked and experiments will be conducted. I went along with these scenes until Noah and Emma attempt to escape. To say that it was executed badly would be an understatement; it was one of the most unrealistic escape sequences I've ever seen, made worse by a completely ill fitting casualness. There was no tension. There was no conflict. It was just a scene like any other.

But they had to escape; Mimzy is dying and has to be sent back to the future (pardon me from using a different film's title). Only when she's returned can the people of her time be healed. I could speculate on whether or not Noah and Emma succeed, but why bother? Despite being a science fiction story, despite having a genuinely interesting idea, ""The Last Mimzy"" is about as formulaic as the majority of other family films. However, being formulaic is not what made this film problematic; I was disappointed by a general lack of development, especially in terms of character. I didn't feel a connection with anyone, least of all with Emma, who was far too mature and articulate to be considered believable. I have no doubt that younger children will be delighted by this movie. Indeed, it does have some good qualities. But on the whole, ""The Last Mimzy"" is an underplayed idea, failing to transcend the simplicity of family entertainment.",1173484800,7,6085,4.978367748279252

2829709,5,B000Q66FB6,"This is a pretty good kids movie from 2007, with plenty of recognizable adult actors in minor roles. Such as Michael Clarke Duncan (The Whole Nine Yards, Green Mile), Kathryn Hahn (Bad Moms), Timothy Hutton (Leverage), to name but a few.  The two leads as you find out if you watch the extras, are a six and eleven year old (playing a ten year old).  Some kid actor led character films can be ruined by kids who to be blunt can't act. Not the case here, Rhiannon Leigh Wryn and Chris O'Neil do a brilliant job.  According to IMDB these two were in a couple of other things after this but nothing major that you're likely to have seen.  A shame as they'd have made some average kids film of their era, a lot better.

This movie is very loosely based on the short story ""Mimsy were the borogoves"" written by Lewis Padgett.  That story has some links to Alice Through the Looking Glass, which you'll learn about if you watch the special features (found on region 4 DVDs). Things such as the objects the kids find in the box have been greatly embelished, again if you watch the numerous special features you'll be entertained and informed of a lot of interesting stuff.  It's worth tracking down an edition with the special features.  If you're player is multizoned and can play region I'd highly recommend it.  With this DVD you can watch the movie, as you would any movie, but you can also rewatch it with text boxes containing trivia (such as all Seattle schools have had metal detectors since whatever date it was) and mostly useless trivia but stuff that does answer questions you might have had when watching it such as do you really need metal detectors at a school this young.  Links also appear on the screen that if you press enter, the movie will pause and play a short documentary on a topic, behind the scenes, casting footage, a deleted scene or something like that.  You can also access all this stuff by the traditional extras style menu.  Interesting one of the deleted scenes was an about to make love scene with the teacher and his girlfriend, where she makes him stop so she can get up and go get birth control, so you can understand why that didn't make the cut for a kid target market film.  LIkewise you learn they digitally added underwear in the scene where he get some chocolate cake.

I thought the movie itself was pretty fun. Basically two kids who are sort of ostracized at school, especially the younger sister for being interested in science and things not so cool, are forced to vacation with just their mother, as their father is too busy at work, on an island a short ferry trip away from Seattle. While on the beach they find a box floating in the wash of the waves, they open it, and being kids aren't cautious at all so touch stuff inside.  The stuff gives them abilities to use their intelligence at a level never seen by mankind before.  There's a time travel element to the box's contents that parallels the opposite of the time travel rules of Terminator. Nothing organic can come through so it is down to what's inside a rabbit to convince the kids to save the future Bill and Ted style world.  But using their new toys the kids cause a statewide blackout which gets them the attention of homeland security and the FBI.

It is aimed at kids so has some artistic liberties you might not let slide in an adult film, such as (spoilers of course) the family has been detained by the FBI at one point, they've just shown the powers of the objects that have blown everyone away, yet that night they sleep in an unguarded room, and the objects are in the next  door labs, just able to be taken back.

The Last Mimzy was rated PG by the Australian classification system with the text ""mild themes, infrequent mild course language."" Now I watched this twice, as a straight film and with the special features going.  Neither time did I notice one swear word and I was looking (well listening) for it the second time.  There may be some obscure word that some old fuddy duddy had added to a list that automatically generates that rating spiel, but there's no words in the film any modern day child or their parents would hear and think was course language.",1481328000,,4184,4.477631578947369

2829713,5,B000Q66FB6,"Did gyre and gimble in the wade;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe."" Lewis Carroll

""Mimsy Were the Borogoves"" is on tape and even on vinyl at one time. It can also be found in some of Henry Kuttner books.

It is a small sci-fi story about a formula that allows you into an alternate universe that everyone used to have access to. The problem with getting there is that it requires a different paradigm and a formula. The paradigm requires a mindset that disappears as we get older and the formula is in front of us if we know where to look. An added plus is that the tape version is read to us enthusiastically by William Shatner.

Playing around with time travel he needed something to put into the cube. He chose some of his old toys. The box never came back. After trying for a second time with no success he gave up and moved on.",1480032000,,858,4.251533742331288

Not the best idea!!  It's a really strange movie; not that it's bad, it's really watchable and I liked it but it's trippy and akin to an X-Files story than a kids story.  They play a Pink Floyd song at then end and my husband and I thought that it was way too fitting for the movie.  I'd say it's more PG13 than PG.",1475193600,,577,3.939655172413793

I found the story and character development to be extremely shallow, relying on the big eyes and cute faces of the kids...who cares?!

2829917,5,B000Q66FB6,"What t me to this movie was a video of the song from the film. Only available on thee soundtrack, the great Roger Waters - ""Hello, I Love You"".
No, this is NOT The Doors song! It is probably the most radio friendly and fabulous song by Waters! With lines lifted from a few Pink Floyd classics, this song stays in my head all day! I caught 3/4 of the movie on cable and loved what I saw so I was off to Amazon! Sure enough, again...they had in stock a DVD not available anywhere else! Even though the main characters are 2 children, I don't consider this a ""Kid's Film"". It's a good sci-fi/fantasy story with great visual effects....the story is heart warming about Mimzy, a stuffed plush rabbit. Without giving away the story, this bunny has been around! A great couple movie or family film. It's not corny or cheesy. It should be priced pretty low by now. It's worth owning. I have watched it a few times. Good casting of the adults too with a different role for Rainn Wilson ""Dwight Schrute"" of ""The Office"" and currently on the new series, the crime, comedy drama, ""Backstrom"". ""The Last Mimzy"" also stars Tim Hutton, Joely Richardson, (The Late) Michael Clarke Duncan & Kathryn Hahn.",1433116800,,1187,4.5

The kids did a very good job and the plot was entertaining enough to keep the adults interested.  Again this is a Hollywood movie so sci fi fans don't get all upset because it is not deep or accurate enough for you.  It is a fun movie, good enough plot to make the kids think and not so confusing that they can't follow the storyline.  For the adults there is enough substance to keep you entertained while not trying to overwealm the youngsters.  This isn't a big time sci fi movie, but is better than most Sci Fy channel movies.  The storyline has a young girl and her older brother discover a strange box on the beach.  Magical things happen and the kids get smarter when young Emma opens the box and then finds ""toys"" inside including a stuffed rabbit called Mimzy.  Good family time movie, worth a watch.",1425081600,,919,4.352941176470588

2829958,5,B000Q66FB6,"I suspected that this movie might be based on Henry Kuttner's  ""Mimzy were the Borogoves"" and indeed it was. In enjoyed this film even if it neglected to follow one key element of the original story that I wish they producers had included.  In the story the children are able to accomplish several things because they haven't grown up enough to think like adults. As adults we have forgotten ""Child Logic"" and a child's perception of time. I can remember spending whole afternoons exploring the galaxy (a pile of dirt) in my flying saucer, an old knob that looked like a saucer to me from a light fixture. These afternoons seemed to last for much more than a few hours playing in the dirt. Each summer vacation was a almost timeless period to explore, fish, hike, camp out, play baseball and so on. A five year old doesn't think like a adult. Maybe our children would understand alien technology better than we would because of this.

That said, the film is an enjoyable story about two children who acquire artifacts from  future and what happens when they begin to use them. There is plenty of drama as the government gets involved with the kids and you can't help rooting for the children to escape government custody and proceed on their own.

I thought the closing song sounded very familiar and it turned out to be ""Hello I Love You"" by Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame.",1424563200,,1375,4.573170731707317

2829979,5,B000Q66FB6,"this movie is from one of my favorite sci-fi short stories: Mimsy were the Borogoves.  the movie vered from the short story and took a LOT of criticism for it, but for it to be made into a children's movie it had to vere away, the ending HAD to be modified.  it kept to most of the plot fairly well, and i thought the dramtic license taken was reasonable.  otherwise, it would have been a thriller.  children could not have been an audience in the movie the sci-fi purists wanted because children could not have put what they were seeing in context.  i liked the movie, and bought it for my grandchildren, along with a mimsy (rabbit) doll from Warner Bros.  if you want to read some good controversy, read reviews of this movie, and it wouldn't hurt to read the short story as well.  the short story raises issues about our (mis)perceptions of children, to the effect that because children aren't at our ""level"" we tend to underestimate them as the powerfully creative and perceptually astute beings that they really are.  their potential is lost on us.  that is the gist of the short story and movie, and in saying that, i do not believe that i have given anything away.",1417392000,,1171,4.485849056603773

2830001,5,B000Q66FB6,"The Last Mimsy is an exceptional, heart-warming and positive science-fiction film both for children and adults. It is as others have commented one of the few sci-fi movies that is truly child-friendly. As sci-fi goes it is intelligent and compelling, one of the few future-referent films addressing the deep future i.e. millions of years hence, as opposed to just a few decades or centuries. It is a good reworking for film of the original novel by Kuttner that preserves the link with the classic nonsense poem ""Jabberwocky"" containing the ""Mimsy"" reference thus introducing children to Lewis Carol's great novels ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through the looking glass"". The film builds up tension and mystery expertly with charming and real child lead roles, and the visual special effects are first class. The contrasting of the children's warm embrace of the benevolent beyond with the superstitious and narrow-minded negative adult responses leads the viewer to lament what is truly lost with childhood - this theme was taken up by the wonderful film song by Roger Waters ""Hello - I love you"". Only one negative gripe - an irritating green political message thrown in (by adults) with the nonsensical idea that pollutants change DNA and that a non-green lifestyle could lead to one growing a second head (Hollywood ""science""). But notwithstanding this, the movie is excellent and watchable many times over.",1412640000,3,1409,5.184210526315789

2830121,3,B000Q66FB6,"This is a rare family/kids film that's also a decent science fiction story.  I haven't read the book, so I'm not comparing it to that.  My almost 8-year-old daughter loved it.  She was a bit scared here and there, but never said she wanted us to turn it off, which she does with a fair number of movies.

I liked the story in general, and I loved the kids.  The adult characters, however, started to grate on me and really kind of ruined what could have been an amazing movie.  Not so much the acting, as the actors are acomplished and some of the work in this movie was decent.  Rather it was the dialog and what I considered to be somewhat contrived nature of how these characters interacted.  The parents were sweet one moment and the next scene were the typical non-listening type.  The science teacher was at first an extremely likeable character, but turned out the have a very non-scientific bent and the way he and his fiance acted in front of the kids parents would have made me want to call the cops!

In the context of a kids movie, this is definitely a fun one, definitely something to watch because it's pretty different from a lot of the standard fare out there.  I just wish that the screenwriters had taken a bit more care in developing the adult characters and writing more believable dialog so that these things didn't distract my adult sensibilities to the point where it took me out of the movie and into a place of annoyance...",1374192000,2,1448,4.446969696969697

I have read the original story Henry Kuttner (I believe it was one of many stories in a book called ""best of Kuttner"" - the one with the robot who could see inside himself painted on the cover).  So I had some preconceptions before watching this movie. The movie is close to the book on many points but I found myself being distracted by the changes.

I watched it a second time and enjoyed it a little more, but I suspect I will always suffer from expecting the book's ending, which is much darker and different than the movie. Who is to say which is better?",1371686400,,634,4.310924369747899

If you took out the demon rat sounds and tied the whole thing together better at the end, it would easily have been more than three stars.  The palm-reading-seance-esque handling of the mysteries with the children was strange as well, and there was a bit too much Hollywooding of the story and characters.  What do I mean by that?

- The bad guys are too over-the-top bad, with the bad guy who'll turn good at the end of the movie obvious.
- The mom is too scared at the small things the kids do with sugar and not scared of the telekinesis and lightning-from-the-hands stuff?
- The wrap-up is too fast and the explanations for what's happening not really clear.
- Dwight as the mystic-ritual-loving school teacher that shows up at the house with explanations is too convenient.  The mother who was horrified at floating sugar tricks is too eager to listen to his prophetic insights to be a believable mother character.
- There's more, but this should suffice for now.

Bottom line: Rent rather than buy.  It's a great idea, good enough effects, but poorly executed.  Our family got through it and my kids have had zero desire to watch it again.  That fact alone speaks volumes to me.",1362441600,,1282,4.563318777292577

While it starts off a little slowly it picks up speed and interest as the children discover what the object they found on the beach can do. Their process of discovery takes them in unexpected directions and creates an aura of mystery and suspense as to where all of their adventures will lead them and how it will all end.

The acting by the children, played by Chris O'Niel as the brother, and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as the sister, is thoroughly engrossing and generates a sympathetic concern for their well-being as the question of the results of their decisions is revealed.

This is a family movie, has a family friendly ending and is suitable for all ages; I recommend it.",1358899200,,760,4.54014598540146
2830200,2,B000Q66FB6,"I've only given this movie two stars because I admire the writer's intention to bring esoteric concepts to a wider audience.  That's asking a lot of the general movie-going public and he deserves praise for that.  If not for that, I would have given this film about 1/2 star.

My mouth kept dropping open at how AWFUL and I mean REALLY AWFUL this film is.  It saddens me to say that because physics is now proving the theories of unified consciousness, collapsing the space/time continuum and so on.  I just wanted those ideas to be presented in a film that was actually entertaining and enlightening.  Unfortunately, this is NOT that film.  It distracts from it's own message so much with it's terrible writing and acting that the audience will never be able to contemplate these larger concepts because the film can never get out of its own way.

For the same reason I despise religious films, this movie is VERY preachy in it's subject matter.  It beats you over the head with its ideas instead of letting them flow organically out of the action.  It seems every other scene is saying, ""HERE!  GET IT!  THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY!""  It's too ""on the nose"", as writers would say.  Subtlety is NOT this movies strongest point.  Neither is the acting.  Except for Joely Richardson, who is great, the rest of the cast is terrible.  Name actors like Michael Clarke Duncan and Oscar winner, Timothy Hutton, just cannot save this terribly corny and literal dialogue across a very disjointed and incongruous storyline.  Things just ""happen"" for no other reason than to forward the story along.  Brian Greene, real-life physicist and author of The Elegant Universe also makes an appearance.  He CAN'T act...even when he's playing..a physicist!

This is also a film that didn't know what it wanted to be.  It's marketed as a children's movie but deals with very complex themes like consciousness, parallel universes, thought transference and even the consequences of losing our civil liberties and freedoms under The Patriot Act.  It deals with all of these issues in an increasingly dark way, but yet....not too dark so we don't scare the kids.  So, it straddles a fence between audiences and never seems to please anyone.  This entire concept needed to be presented in a full-on dark, adult movie.  Forget this film.  I was watching this alone and groaned out loud many times.  It's the worst writing, acting and storyline I've seen in quite a long, long time...years, really.  Movies are supposed to keep you thinking about them for hours or days after you've seen it.  I'm definitely thinking about this one, but not for the right reasons.  I'm still in AWE of how very TERRIBLE this film was, how it ever got made and included so many decent actors who should have known better. What a disappointment.",1358467200,,2801,4.784968684759916

The story opens on the future scientist who sends the Mimzy to our time, but all we know about him is there is some terrible crisis in his time, and this is his last chance to get help from his past. Apparently, time travel is no easy matter, and this is indeed his last chance.

So what does he send? A capsule (fascinating design) containing pretty much anything necessary to attempt to communicate with children in our time. Most especially, it includes the Mimzy, which looks like a stuffed toy bunny but is actually some highly sophisticated technology.

Not going to spoil it too much for you, but I will let you in on why the bunny is called Mimzy: there's one just like it (or maybe even the same one) in a picture of Alice Little aka Alice in Wonderland. Emma concludes that she probably didn't know what to do with it, and that's why he has come back again.

Emma and Noah try to keep the Mimzy and the ""toy box"" it came in away from the grown-ups, but the effort proves futile. Just as their parents are getting wise to it, and to the amazing science fair project Noah builds entirely on his own, the Department of Homeland Security bursts in on them because they have pinpointed the source of a major power outage to their house. After that it gets REALLY weird!

Do the kids manage to help the Mimzy and the people of the future? Will the Homeland Security types succeed in pinning a terrorist label on the kids or their parents? What will happen to the teacher who dreams about them and his fiance, who knows all about the strange mandalas Noah keeps drawing?

She couldn't even read when shooting began, so she memorized her lines by hearing people read them aloud to her. Critics made a big deal about Drew Barrymore's breakout performance in E.T. as a child, but as engaging as she was back then, Wryn is much stronger in this. Everyone else in the cast is spot-on, too.

Each of these artifacts increase the children's intellect in some way, as well as provide them with telekinetic superpowers. The coolest toy of the lot, a stuffed talking rabbit named Mimzy, has been sent down to earth with a specific purpose, and as the two kids dig deeper into the mysteries surrounding them, the circumstances surrounding Mimzy's visit  become clearer. Soon, the kids find themselves in a race to save mankind.

If you grew up with Flight of the Navigator, Explorers, and E.T, you may just love this film. It has a Speilbergian feel to it, and the musical score is just as magical.

2830243,3,B000Q66FB6,"This is, in Hollywood parlance, a ""high concept"" movie. And it's dressed up pretty well. The special effects are top shelf and the other production values are solid. So what happened during the casting phase? Did the producers dump all their dough in the production and run out just in time to hire the cast? You do get Tim Hutton and Rainn Wilson doing a fine job on their parts, but everyone else, including the two lead kids, needed punching up. It's not that all these others do a bad job, it's just that their faces don't open up to the camera.

As others have mentioned, comparisons to E.T. are inevitable. But here you get no Henry Thomas or Drew Barrymore. As good as the two leads are in Mimzy, they don't have ""It"". It's not their fault. They simply shouldn't have been hired.

The story is pretty cool and it opens up some interesting ideas. That the young boy finds that spiders react to sound, and how he was able to manipulate that, was way cool. One fairly major sticking point is Homeland Security's part in the story. After they realize they aren't dealing with terrorists they apologize and go their merry way. Homeland Security doesn't just apologize and walk away from a situation such as this. They are going to make sure someone is going to get kicked in the testicles. I didn't buy that for a second. That aside the script was decent.

This was a frustrating movie for me to watch. They had so much right on and then they screw up on such a fundamental point. This is still worth watching and more than worth the average viewer's time. Just don't go in expecting too much. You might be let down.",1288828800,,1618,4.45945945945946

It would have been great to be included in the film. While I don't have kids of my own to be my test viewers, I can only think on face value.  Producer Michael Phillips (E.T.) also worked on the popular nostalgic films of The Sting and Cannery Row with David S. Ward.  His tendency to over-produce and add too many new ingredients repeats in Mimzy. Robert Shaye was an unusual choice for a director with only one previous film among his credits. So, two producers are deciding where the final film will go.  The special effects were overdone and the music often repetitive, but the children's parts were well cast even though a bit too young for so many stressful and demanding situations. Alien fiction can also do without the cliches of bright lights and superior races that always let themselves be discovered by the F.B.I.(Why were they so superior if they let their presence leak out by causing a power failure?) There are plenty of trivia, video games and puzzles on the extra menu that kids might enjoy.

2830270,3,B000Q66FB6,"For the most part, ""The Last Mimzy"" is an sweet and inventive film that traces the adventures of two kids as they grapple with a strange machine. The kids, brother and sister, live believable suburban lives, dealing with violin lessons, workaholic Dad and cheating on science tests. One day at the beach, they discover a buzzing, humming machine that gives them subtle but extraordinary perception of the world around them. Though the kids are desperate to hide their new toy from their parents, the gizmo eventually ends up coming to the attention of the authorities.

The movie visuals are wonderfully arresting. The kids see illuminated power lines connecting everything around them; objects whoosh in an out of existence; spinning stones exude a lighted miasma of complex patterns. The plot also seems intriguing, tying the kids' activities with those of Alice of Looking Glass fame. The film, which has everything going for it, though, falls almost completely apart in the last half hour. Intriguing plot threads are abandoned or hurriedly explained away through dialog. The final denouement, which has Homeland Security and the family on a collision course, is resolved too neatly.

SPOILER ALERT!!

After causing major power disruptions and a cosmic light show that is literally out of this world, the federal authorities apologize for doubting the kids, get back into their chopper and fly away. Culpable or not, the real authorities would have even MORE questions for the kids after what they had seen. Add to that the family's unlikely imprisonment a few doors away from he lab that holds their weird toys-- a facility, by the way, that has no guards and trucks parked conveniently with the keys inside -- and you see where his movie goes from fantastic yet plausible to just plain ridiculous.

2830272,1,B000Q66FB6,"I took two younger girls to see this movie, and all THREE of us agreed that it was a total ""waste"" of time... Everyone who keeps saying that there is ""something for everyone"" is sorely mistaken. Coming from a Christian home, I was extremely uncomfortable with all of the ""new age"" propaganda (which is NOT like Disney magic in the slightest) and bizarre things that were going on. Watching teachers ""read"" the palm of a 5 year old (or how-ever old she was) was actually disturbing to me. As if parents just let people do things like that to their children while they're sitting right there... Perhaps you would, if you were totally fine with palm reading. But, I know plenty of people who are not.

  The film had an over-all ""tense"" feeling that never really delivers but, puts someone who was expecting something pleasant in an uncomfortable state... like the one of wondering whether something is going to ""pop"" out of the cabinets or something.

  The storyline was something so enormously far fetched that my 13 year old sister had no idea what had even just hit her. Unlike a movie like ""Bridge to Terribithia,"" or something of that nature, this movie would require you to know about ""mysticism,"" and ""new age"" beliefs to understand HALF of what's going on.

  The child star is extremely ""creepy"" in some scenes. She does things like ""shows someone"" a magic trick which totally freaks this person out. Especially when she inserts her hand into a floating globe that appears to be disintegrating it. She does other strange things and becomes steadily more creepy leading some of us to wonder if she's really being influenced by the devil or something. Talking about ""astrology"" and what not.

  Perhaps the ""strange"" language that this stuffed bunny is always spewing out was supposed to sound ""cute"" but in reality, I think myself and a lot of people just found it to be disturbing.

  I would NOT suggest this movie to young children or to anyone sensitive. It might scare them terribly. If you however like the idea of all the ""Tibbetian"" and ""New Age"" stuff then go for it. My personal thought? It'll completely go over most children's heads and stay in their minds as a really strange thing they saw when they are older.",1231113600,7,2231,4.699228791773779

All sorts of supernatural things happen and the children can see into different dimensions and communicate telephatically with other creatures. The movie plot really starts to intensify when the feds find out that the source of the power outage occured in the children's home and then they find out what exactly caused it.

2830287,5,B000Q66FB6,"A remarkable and refreshing effort with a near perfect job by cast, crew, directors and producers.  A beautifully done plot builds excitement as the mysterious ""toys"" which wash up on shore have a dramatic effect on the young brother and sister that find them.  The message imparted to Emma, the young girl who becomes enamored of her stuffed rabbit ""Mimzy"" eventually involves conflict with the Dept. of Homeland Security as the family and the girl are swept up in a drama with the most profound consequences to the far future.

The movie begins and ends with a teacher of the far future recounting the story of how they were saved by the ""Mimzy"" child's ability to understand the message and act on it.  Particularly striking in these opening and closing scenes is the utter beauty of the flowers and open airy sunlit space in which the future teacher instructs her young students, telepathically, about the great events of Mimzy's young friend.

Particularly to be applauded are the special effects of the movie, from dimensional portals which open up with 3d light and vortex effects, to the plain glass rectangle which computes the geometrical angles and aids its young owner in making a 300 yard golf shot.

The movie is quite stunning and will be immensely enjoyed by both younglings

2830291,5,B000Q66FB6,"It's almost impossible to find a good live-action family film that captures magic anymore. From the utterly boring ""Water Horse"" or the laundry list of fantasy film clones that come out each year. This movie on the other hand is different from the rest. Words like ""Clone"" and ""Boring"" don't belong anywhere near this movie. Instead, words like ""Original,"" ""Captivating,"" ""Cute,"" and ""Weird"" are used. Now, how many family films come anything close to original nowadays? If you're tired of the standard fare, or at least want a new twist to it, look no further.

Basically, global warming has wreaked havoc in future Earth, and a brilliant scientist has devised a way to save it, by sending stuffed rabbits and toys to the past, to receive the special item that will save humanity. One of these care packages lands in the hand of two kids, one of whom is already bright (we're never privy as to why), and since they don't know how to keep a secret, trouble soon starts as the toys get feisty, and time starts running out.

The cast does a good job with their roles. The kids are cute of course, and they do a very good job. And I might be partial, but Rainn Wilson does a perfect job as his dreaming teacher. His parter also does a good job, and Michael Clark Duncan is fine with what little he's given. The dad, although sometimes nonexistent, whether he's there or not, also does ok. But the mother on the other hand, greatly detracted from the movie for me. I mean, she's half off her rocker, and she's so annoying and emotional and crazed with every half-brained and annoying thing she does. Such an over-reactor, I was like, somebody do a major rewrite of this character. Believe it or not, she's the very low-point of the this very good movie. And it's a tie between her and government for the movie's ""villain."" I hated her character so much; this movie gets downgraded half a point on my scale.

Anyways, the story moves along rather quickly, and the backstory is almost non-existent, but the rest of it certainly keeps you interested and entertained. It's fun to watch these kids have all these cool abilities, and to watch a five-year old girl be smarter than the brightest minds man currently has to offer. You'll certinly get giddy during some of the moments, and you'll feel the emotion and tenseness during other moments. This movie draws you into it, and makes you feel for the girl and her otherworldly bunny. And makes you hate the mother all the more when she agonizingly takes the bunny away.

While all these elements make for an excellent film, some might be offended, or further weirded out by the ever-present new age aspects. So present in fact, they ground the story, which might offend parents that are more traditional. Even if it doesn't offend you, it will certainly weird you out.

Overall, while some might think the movie is too out in left field, many might take it as the original movie it is. While not perfect, it'll make you wide-eyed, and bring out a sense of wonder, no matter how ridiculous or futuristic the movie might seem. So, next family movie night, pick up this underrated popcorn flick, and prepare for your little ones to become even more attached to their stuffed animal than they already are.

Real Score: 4.5

By the way, I hated the infinifilm edition of this film. I mean, they can't have all the 30-second special features all grouped together. Nope, you have to search for them by watching the movie all over again. And even when you do find them, they're lame at best. The fact track sucks even worse, giving information that is useless and uninteresting at best. Really, DVD On TV and AMC Enhanced TV is superior at this, and the DVD shouldn't be trying to copy those shows anyhow.",1218412800,,3739,4.613533834586466

I'm probably one of the most skeptical, cynical people you'll know, but I loved the uplifting ending. Why? Because it's fantasy! Yes, few things about the story are believable here, but neither was it believable when Elliott escaped with E.T. and flew him to safety on his bike. This is a sci-fi kids movie. It isn't for us to marvel at how realistic the story is, it's for kids to let their imaginations soar and pretend they can do this sort of stuff. So... why did I only give this movie 3 stars? Two words: environmentalist propaganda. I'm really tired of all the RUBBISH about how technology is evil, and how we're destroying this world, and how in order to save it we should all trash our SUVs, unplug our computers, become vegans, and spend our days meditating and connecting to mother Earth... My kids definitely don't need to hear any of it. It wasn't even the message itself that got me, but the fact that it does not connect whatsoever with the main storyline. What the heck do mandalas and palm-reading have to do with a dying future that's looking for unpolluted DNA from the past? It simply did not fit, and seemed like someone's clever (NOT) attempt to push their nonsensical beliefs on the viewers in the guise of a cute and cuddly kids sci-fi movie.",1217030400,,1375,4.526104417670683

Embrace your inner child, and follow along through an adventure story that intertwines telepathy, telekinesis (moving stuff with your mind!), challenging ones beliefs about physical reality, and learning to view time/space in a different way altogether.

Most importantly, this story is one about compassion and opening up to others. It challenges us to not only trust in the Universe and in ourselves, but also to trust in others who may have experiences we can't explain or relate to.",1212364800,,572,5.150537634408602

2830309,5,B000Q66FB6,"A great all-ages fantasy, ""The Last Mimzy"" blends modern/fururistic elements like time travel and advanced computer technology into a classic-feeling tale of adventure and discovery to create a space-age fairy tale.  After discovering a cache of wonders, including a living 'toy' rabbit named Mimzy, two children begin to develop strange new powers.  Initially disbelieved after making wild claims about Mimzy and the rest of their finds, the children's family starts taking things a lot more seriously when one of the strange new curios causes a phenomenon that shuts down the power grid over a wide expanse of territory.  This also brings government agents in on the situation. It could be argued that given the level of the goings-on the government agencies are an unrealistically 'soft' antagonist, but it could equally be argued that not only would it not be possible to make a 'small children-friendly' film of this type and still depict the government forces in the more aggressive, cynical manner that one would expect a movie to have in the situation; but that a 'nicer', more balanced picture of the agents is more in fitting with the movie's stance on hope, idealism, and the whole 'better nature of people' angle.

  Mimzy, the two Wilder children that found him, and their allies end up being key to an effort in the future to save the world.  Both spiritual and envirornmentally-themed, the show ends up as a genuinely uplifting odyssey.  The only real negative is that there were perhaps more openings for the rabbit Mimzy to be put in a direct focus (including some possible comedic angles) but it's really hard to fault it too much on what wasn't in it when everything that was there was so great.  Perhaps they can explore a few of those other avenues if there's ever a sequel.

2830310,5,B000Q66FB6,"Here's a movie seemingly for children which is really much more than you might think. As with Lewis Carroll's great works (and many others) it works on the adult level as well as on the more elementary. The documentary included with the movie on this disc suggests that much of what happens in the movie is theoretically, at least, possible and not just fantasy. In many ways, ""The Last Mimsy"" reminds me of ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" which is all for adults because of its intellectual content only (not rated, but it should have a G). The ""magic"" in both of these movies is based on the most advanced thinking of Superstring Theory from today's physics (Alice fits in here, too!) and is more than just wishful thinking.  This, for me at least, is the most charming thing about this charming movie. And, as some of you know, quarks have charm, too, or so they call it.  Is it the same thing as we see here?  I think so. It's called love. The glue of the universe. That bit's not scientific, perhaps, but it connects with the other winning qualities of this movie to make it real for me, and for many others.  Further than this, I'd just like to agree with many of the other reviewers here who comment on the excellent acting and direction.  The color quality is also superb, as is the sound. In all, much more than may meet the jaded eye, and not just for the young. There's a profound reason why many adults love stories of this sort, and it's not just sentiment.",1206403200,2,1467,4.398523985239852

I needed to watch it several times before I caught everything that was going on in it and understood somethings. So when you watch it make sure you are not distracted or make sure you can watch it again.

Over all a good movie if you like Sci-Fi and fantasy which I do. It is family oriented which is great but my husband isn't into movies like this one, so he wouldn't even watch he fell asleep because he was board with it. Oh well his loss!!",1202860800,,717,4.013986013986014

The story itself is compelling and while it is carried by the nonsensical noises of a stuffed animal the plot and events which take place during the film lead to everyone talking about what they thought. The beautiful incorporation of geometry and history which is woven into a fictional plot are quite enjoyable but I felt strongly that certain story elements didn't fit, particularly the government response which was sort of baffling in terms of how the story ended (i.e. DHS does the DHS thing then says sorry, kthnxby).

After seeing the downloaded version of the film I decided to buy the DVD and the various features were a surprising plus since we not only watched the movie again but the playable games and interactive viewing options were enjoyable.

I highly recommend this movie but I also haven't read the work it was based upon so I can't speak for the integrity of the story just the film itself.",1200355200,3,1071,4.716577540106952

2830326,3,B000Q66FB6,"Like so many movies adapted from great written works, The Last Mimzy misses the mark by a mile and a half. The original story involves a time travel experiment, two sets of toys from the future and three different timelines. It is a tale of ideas and intimate family interactions that has a message of mental transformation and progressiveness. In the early 40's, the U.S. educational system underwent massive changes including standardization and improved funding. The ""new"" university offered students more academic freedom as well as restructured sciences and humanities departments. The underlying theme of ""Mimsy Were the Borogoves"" relates to the social and educational changes of the times by juxtaposing the free thinking children against the stagnant mind set of the parents.

The plot of The Last Mimzy seems more like something written by Al Gore on an acid trip. The future is in peril as human DNA has been corrupted by pollution. A scientist sends a set of toys into the future in order to attract ""pure DNA"". It is supposed that the innocence and malleable minds of children will be ready to comprehend the toys for the high tech devices they really are. Enter the FBI (Michael Clark Duncan), one hippie teacher (Rainn Wilson) and a ridiculous song by sell out Roger Waters and you have the perfect tree hugging, ecological disaster plot to make any conservationist proud. Mimzy means well with its message of ""Save Mother Earth"", but it could have been accomplished through an entirely original script rather than stealing a few good parts from a classic piece of fiction and throwing away what was essentially the identity and point of ""Mimsy Were the Borogoves"". All that can be said about Director Robert Shaye is that he needs to stay away from the camera and just keep funneling his money into producing great films like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and the upcoming Golden Compass (His Dark Materials) series.

Perhaps the criticism is harsh considering this is supposed to be a ""children/young adult"" movie, but these are exactly the kind of films that should not get a pass. Suggestion: Instead of plopping your child in front of the TV for a few hours of peace and quiet, hand them a copy of the original story. Not only will they gain more insight into free thinking but their minds will not be addled by watching this completely unentertaining calamity which relies too heavily on special effects and liberal agenda to get its point across.",1198022400,4,2468,4.88782816229117

Alice in Wonderland and The Velvetine Rabbit are embedded in the mind, perhaps the culture. Draws on that. Feeds the soul, inspires thought, and entertains.

A lovely and powerful science fiction story involving Tibetan mandalas, quantum physics, Alice in Wonderland, and a dying race desperate for a last-ditch chance to procure a gene from a pure soul.

2830345,3,B000Q66FB6,"My definition of good science fiction is a piece of work that asks an intriguing question and then answers it very honestly. By that definition, ""The Last Mimsy"" is a fine bit of science fiction film. Not surprisingly, it is based on an actual short story, and not an original screenplay. That means there are actually some signs of intelligence in the script.

In this movie, a happy spring vacation at a beach house in the Seattle area is interrupted by a strange geodesic box that washes up on the beach. You know you're in trouble when it starts doing strange things and the kids decide to keep it a secret from mom. Not because of what the box is doing, but because of what the kids are doing. How many real kids do you know would look at that thing and say, oh- better not tell mom! Mine would all be running and shouting, ""Mom! Mom! Look at this cool thing we found!"" They do that whenever they find a piece of glass, a bottle cap, or a lady bug. I think the geodesic box would get similar treatment.

So now we know that these kids aren't real kids, just fictional kids. But it is still fun to watch as they explore the strange powers of their newly found flotsam and finally piece together the puzzle of what they're supposed to do with it, all before the babysitter, the creepy middle school science teacher and his palm reading fiance, the Homeland Security Department, and mom and dad can well-meaningly interfere.

There were some really delightful moments. Whoever directed this film got some wonderful performances out of the children. Young as they were, their acting never jarred me. And the parents were believably jarred when their children started displaying strange powers. I still can't figure out why they decided to consult that creepy science teacher and his astrologist fiance about it, though.

The special effects were impressive, but not overdone. One of the film's strengths was its power of understatement. Except when Homeland Security breaks in and hauls everyone off to the science lab. What was that about?

So I hope you enjoy ""The Last Mimsy"" as much as we did. Maybe even more because you don't have a two-year-old screaming in your ear for more m&m's during all the significant dialog.",1194912000,,2224,4.663265306122449

The technology aspect of this film is rather cool in some of the idea that they put out there. Makes you really think as to were we are really going with some of the stuff we do now.

2830348,3,B000Q66FB6,"The premise of the movie is beautiful. I was expecting a magical presentation about a serious topic that I could watch with my child.  I did not expect a clichd beating you over the head but trying to look like it's not film. I got it that we are destroying the environment and ourselves. I got it that we've need to do something. I got it that we should be open to possibilities. I got it that things that sometimes seem like bogus new agey beliefs or supernatural powers may really mask some science or tech we just don't yet understand. I like the idea of future humans sending messages to the past to prevent the kind of future they are now facing. Based on one early scene, I wasn't sure if there were reptillian type beings trying to prevent the scientist from sending the message to the past or what. I thought good mystery.  I liked that we have to work to figure it out the meaning of the message. I didn't mind that it takes a 1)particular type of person (a pure innocent child) to be able to 2)receive the message (essentially enters wonderland by interacting with the ""toys"")and with a team and some serious risk (""engineer"" bro  and sympathetic teacher) get the job done.

The film just didn't do a good job of depicting all of that.
The teacher's lecture about genes sounded like he was pushing nature side of the nature vs. nurture argument. The parents were the typical narcissistically distracted and busy but deep down really care and will come around, type. As usual, they were good at emoting and screaming and not so good at helping the smart kids save the world.

The depiction of DHS just made me laugh. I wanted to go enough already. I was hoping for it to be as magical and as it was set up to be. It had me up until that genetics lecture which was relatively early on. My kid fell asleep after that scene and I plodded on hoping it would get better!

 In short, the film was weighed down with too many clichd scenes that were not done well. Even the child actors typically cute and smart looking, seemed stiff and uncomfortable in the roles. The adults were just props. It was a disappointing film. The music on the other hand was pretty good.

A stuffed rabbit named Mimzy comes out of the box and begins speaking to Emma, telling her how to spin the rocks and how to make a vibrational energy column appear.

As the children experiment with the stuff in the box, they begin to experience some unusual happenings, like seeing energy grids, psycho kinesis, telepathy, and popping objects into and out of other dimensions. Meanwhile, Mimzy goes everywhere with Emma and tells her very special things.

2830363,3,B000Q66FB6,"My rating:
1 star = abysmal
2 star = poor
3 stars = good
4 stars = great
5 stars = must own!

This was only a 3 stars for me for several reasons. . . .

1) Yes, it was an intersting / creative idea
2) Yes, I didn't know what to expect in the end
3) Yes, I had automatic sympathy for the protagonists because they were cute kids
4) Yes, its sci-fi so that gets automatic stars in my book
5) Yes, a rule behind time travel is stated, which explains the whole plot of why they (the future) do what they do in this movie. This further added to the creativity of the story idea

But. . .

Many reviewers say this is a family movie but they forget that giving into ""realism"" doesn't mean we need to encourage kids in certain behaviors.

For instance, in an early scene the main kid's friend gives him the answers to a test and his reply is, ""Cool!"" Yes, he doesn't use the answers in the end, but he doesn't stand up for what is right either. He uses some lame excuse, takes ridicule from his friend and that is that. What was the purpose of the scene then?

A true family movie would have set a better example in kid's choices with the test answers and his standing up to a friend that wasn't much of a friend to begin with. But this is only one of several similar un-family oriented behavior (i.e. name calling, talking back to parents, etc) the movie portrays.

Also, there is this whole Tibetian mysticism / sci-fi thing going on.
I'm a HUGE sci-fi fan and I'm still not sure if the marriage between the mysticism and the ""future"" worked well or not.

The concept on how the future tries to save the world was creative. The film's delivery was well done, with some cool special effects, though the effects are used less than a standard sci-fi channel sitcom would use some.

Ridiculous marketing thrown in! The goverment at one point discovers that in the future the company, Intel, is a major player. They spend a good 30 seconds highlighting this point. Gimme a break. Leave commercials out of movies!

There are several story threads that get dropped completely. Such as some scientists want to do further tests on the kids because of their abnormally high brain activity. After the scene, we never hear anything about it again. Once the ""mission"" is accomplished, do the kids still exhibit such activity? If the end had shown us the kids with a whisper of their ""abilities"" still intact, that would have been a better way to end the movie in my opinion.

Also, the government gets involved at one point. The goverment even witnesses some miraculous things then just leaves in the end with no further, ""We'll need to bring you in for further questioning"".

I can only blame the story thread failures on poor editing and/or a limited budget (it was only a 90 minute movie).

OVERALL:
It was interesting to watch.
The sense of discovery pulls the viewer in.
I'd personally only let my 9yr old or older watch it since they have more experience in filtering out the bad attitudes and actions portrayed.

""The Last Mimzy"" is such a shameless and unabashed rip-off of ""E.T.-The Extra Terrestrial"" that Steven Spielberg ought to sue the makers of the film for blatant copyright infringement of his famous material.

Noah and Emma Wilder are two Seattle youngsters who discover a mysterious box floating in the ocean.  Upon opening it, the children find it contains several abnormal objects including an odd stuffed-animal rabbit that calls itself Mimzy and communicates in a garbled, incomprehensible language to the little girl.  In addition, the children themselves become endowed with strange preternatural knowledge and extrasensory powers as a result of their encounter with the material.  The first part of the movie is dedicated to the kids' efforts to hide the secret from their parents, while the second involves the government scientist's typically clumsy efforts at studying the bizarre phenomenon.

Virtually every major idea from ""E.T."" manages, at some point or other, to find its way into this film, starting with the basic alien-from-outer-space-being-hidden-by-adorable-children scenario and heading on from there.  The other similarities include the psychic connection between alien and child, the frightened, uncomprehending adults, the threatening government officials, the seemingly dying alien, and the kids' stealing of a vehicle in an effort to outrun the authorities.  This is certainly not the first movie to try to siphon off some of ""E.T.""'s irreproducible charms for its own benefit (""Short Circuit,"" ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Indian in the Cupboard"" come first to mind), but it is definitely the creepiest and most New Age-y of the lot.  Then, after all is said and done, the screenplay gives us an anticlimactic epilogue so convoluted and muddled that even Stephen Hawking himself would have trouble comprehending it.

As Noah and Emma, Chris O'Neill and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn don't exactly set the screen on fire with their performances, but they are at least adequate to the task they are called on to fulfill - which is more than can be said for Timothy Hutton, Joely Richardson, Rainn Wilson and Michael Clark Duncan who are stranded in poorly written roles as the various adults on hand.

Its creator is a scientist who lives in an Earth that has been so polluted that the human gene pool has been horribly damaged.  These scientist makes these toy dolls and sends them back through time to collect virgin human DNA to bring back to the future to replenish the human gene pool.  No Mimzy has ever made it back to the future, except for the one discovered by Emma and Noah, a sister and brother who live in Seattle with their parents.  Once discovered, Mimzy embues both siblings with astonishing brainpower and technical skills that changes their lives, and leads them to create a bridge through time for Mimzy to travel through.  The DNA Mimzy takes back is from a teardrop from Emma.

This was one of those movies that did not do that well at the theaters.  Its release was short, and soon ended up on DVD.  This is surprising considering the quality of this movie.

2830396,3,B000Q66FB6,"This is an enjoyable film that features decent performances and effects, and is an overall appealing show for families.  It begins with the basic plot of an extraordinary encounter that brings magical powers and big responsibilities to a couple of young children who are not quite ready for it.  The film plays off of the wonder and curiosity that there may be powers beyond the ordinary -- something that almost all fantasy scenarios draw upon -- and ties this scenario to the idea that only through imagination and wonder and belief can the world be saved.  Well none of this is new (see ET, The Never Ending Story, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, The Bridge to Terabithia) it feels fairly novel and is fairly well executed and sustained my children's interest and excitement throughout, though as a film it pales in comparison to any of the others I just mentioned.  Part of the problem is that there is never a very strong hint of the darkness or danger that needs to be overcome, and not much of a sense of why specifically these two young children are chosen to save the world (of the future).  There isn't much of an antagonist and the protagonists are fairly generic (apart from the fact that the younger sister is said to be something of a child prodigy -- she seems for the most part just to be a precocious young and cute girl, along the lines of your standard cute young Hollywood starlet, something of a cross between the young Dakota Fanning and Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine).  Unlike many of the classic films in this genre, these children don't have to face up to a crisis in their parents' relationships (the father is portrayed as a hard working hero who would really just like to be with his children but sacrifices to work hard and pay for vacation cottage on the beach; and the mother as a near saint -- on the model of the classic television housewives who can put up with everything -- who never complains at the long hours her husband works and only ""loses it"" momentarily when she fears for her children's lives).  The government forces who investigate the consequences of the children's new-found powers are depicted as benign but merely misunderstanding (unlike, say, the authorities in E.T.).  Even the alien dangers from the future that they are trying to overcome are not presented as very scary -- as far as I can tell they amount to human beings losing their genetic capacity for imagination and becoming technological bureaucrats or robots -- and in fact from the beginning it is clear that these dangers will be overcome because the story is told by someone from the future who tells some children that she will be explaining to them how their world was saved.  Overall, then, while this is more interesting and well made and a stronger story than your average made for television fantasy, it is far less compelling than some of the classic fantasies it is modelled after.

Everything from psychokenesis to sacred geometries to telepathy to healing oneself struck far closer to my personal experiences than any other fictional movie I have seen.

Nevertheless, as I began to think of comparisons to ET, that's when I began to see why I didn't absolutely love it.

Perhaps society is just speeding up and we have to hit the major plot points as quick as possible to keep the audience from dozing off, but the heart in this film seemed to be forced quickly.  When compared to Spielberg's old sci-fi flicks of the 80s - such as ET or Close Encounters - they built slow, took their time, and focused on the humanity.  That's what made them great.

At the end, I'm not entirely clear on what the key to saving humankind was that the Mimzy was supposed to find in our time and bring back to the future.  Clearly the girl's tears on the Mimzy bunny had something to do with it... is it simply compassion or was it something to do with DNA?  It wasn't very clear.  Did Alice of ""Alice and the Looking Glass"" who also had a Mimzy rabbit not have tears of compassion?  Or was her DNA contaminated, since the movie talks about environmental contamination of some kind in the future?  Unclear.  When the Mimzy rabbit returns to the science lab of the future and releases its cargo, a teen boy and teen girl take off the alien-looking ""space suits"" they are wearing and walk naked into the shining light.  Not clear on what that was supposed to represent either.  Why were they naked, for example?  Overall what I took away from this movie was tidbits about Tibetan religious mandalas, reading palms, and nanotechnology.  The rest of the story was cute and the acting was fine.  The FBI who respond to the ""terrorist"" blackout of the state of Washington were wimpy and silly.  I guess the director didn't want to inject too much peril by making them realistic (or there's a social/political comment in there).

2830435,4,B000Q66FB6,"Number one:  The Infini thing is cool.

First, let me start off by saying that I am a theoretical physicist.  Second, that I generally do not like sci-fi movies or books.  The reason is that they often try to give some sort of high-tech explanation that ruins it for me because the explanations are often written by individuals who only ""may"" understand the science at a low level.

This is why I loved this movie.  The critics panned this movie because they said that the story was too disjointed.  Too many plot elements:  Was the whole thing in the future environmental as was ""preached"" by the hippie science teacher?  Should we take a closer look at new age ideas? Is the Patriot Act bad?  Pick a plot and go with it.  If you watch the movie then you will understand why they make these comments.  I agree that there was a myriad of plot elements, and this is EXACTLY why I loved this movie.  They never really explained anything except that people can't travel through time.  What they do ""do"" is allow you to view some strange events and that's it.  They don't say ""worm hole"", even though the idea inspired the special effects.  They don't find the secret of the universe in a crystal.  In fact, the hippie science teacher is really a skeptic.  Again, they don't really pick any perspective to ""explain"" things, which is why it worked for me.  Explain enough for me to get the general gist of why things are happening and for what purpose and don't ruin it with technical ""explanations"" that are simply wrong.  I read one review how this would not appeal to serious minded adults.  Well maybe I am just not serious.

One more thing, the reason for not giving it 5 stars.  The ending was too quick.  The main part was fine, but Duncan's character was dumb.  A high ranking government employee witnesses kids doing some very extraordinary things and basically says, ""Sorry and have a nice day?""  I don't think so.  UFOs and alien abductions aside, those government guys take things pretty seriously no matter how strange.  I know a few guys so far up in the NSA that they do not live in our reality.  Those guys, ""would be in touch;)""

Bottom line: Don't make love stories disjointed, I understand that, but don't try to explain strange science too much.  Just don't contradict yourself and we will be fine.",1186185600,16,2313,4.554744525547445

2830437,3,B000Q66FB6,"I admit it, I wanted to see this movie mainly because the bunny was cute.

I liked the movie because it was a nice little story, good message, pretty visually.  Not many seem to mention or think this, but I really liked the little boy who played in the film.  And of course, loved the bunny. And, I watched it twice, and I couldn't help but cry, I got the message and I'm pretty emotional.

However, as one who very much loves sci fi films, I wouldn't say this one was great-- I'm not moved to buy it.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't find it all that convincing.  I have a degree in science, and it was a little difficult to immerse myself in the story.. the thing with the spiders?  Not that I have trouble with time travel and dreams and all that... I like that sort of stuff, but like I said, something doesn't quite sit right with me.  The movie struck me as somewhat anti-climactic.  And the parent's roles were horrible and stiff.  They came off at first as parents that would talk to their kids, but they ended up going haywire, and their dialogue felt too scripted.

The biggest insult however, is to compare this movie to E.T.  No way.  There's something about E.T. that was far more believable, maybe because it didn't go through all these weird effects.  And maybe because the alien was real in the film. I think some of the best movies are very simply made, without a lot of visually distracting 'stuff.'

In essence, I wanted to love the movie, but I didn't find it totally believable. There are a lot of kids movies I prefer to this one.  But I still want the bunny...",1185494400,2,1593,4.277591973244147

Unfortunately the originality of the storyline is overshadowed by overt similarities with the all-time family favorite `E.T.'.

Yes, the book upon which this movie is based predates the Spielberg classic but `E.T.' hit the big screen first and thus takes presidence in the hearts and minds of the viewing public. To make matters worse the production choose a young boy who looks like `E.T.' star Henry Thomas as one of the films co-stars further establishing the pronounced similarities between the two feature films. I think that was a big mistake, not that Chris O'Neil didn't give a fine performance as Noah Wilder, I just think the director should have known better and found someone with a completely different look. On a more positive note, little Rhiannon Wryn is marvelous as Emma Wilder. Without her presence the film would lose its strongest asset.

Little kids will love it even though they will probably miss some of the more complicated twists in the plot. For most adults one viewing is definitely enough.

The script is easy to follow and the acting and production values are great. No sex, violence, or profanity for parents to worry about.
I didn't read the original story, written in the late 1940s, that inspired this screenplay. But it's clear from the DVD special features that the writers took considerable liberties when they adapted the concept. Purists may not like this, but it translates well to a present-day setting - except for one thing.
My biggest complaint about the movie is that the screenplay employed a standard Hollywood gimmick that I've grown very tired of: heavy-handed government bureaucrats. When a strange device in the children's home causes a brief but extensive electrical blackout, the Department of Homeland Security goes into emergency terrorist-hunting mode based on practically no evidence. The FBI later bursts into the home, grabbing people at gunpoint, offering no explanation, and when the father asks to see a search warrant, he is told none was needed because there was probable cause. At the end of the movie, the same gun-toting troop shows up again, and when everything is resolved, they simply say, ""Sorry - never mind"" and fly off in their black helicopters. Not very realistic, to say the least. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief for sci-fi story elements like super-advanced technology, time travel, etc., but when it comes to things that really exist today, I expect screenwriters to do their homework and come up with something better than such contrived characterizations.

2830462,2,B000Q66FB6,"Just before a family member and I sat down to watch ""The Last Mimzy"", a curious thing happened  -  neither of us, we discovered, could say what it was about.  We'd seen the TV ads and yet knew nothing.  (My relative liked the name and thought the bunny was cute.)  Actually seeing the movie didn't help; it wants to be another ""E.T."", I think, but ends up as the most curious and didactic family release in a long time.

The titular mimzy arrives in a tetrahedral care package discovered afloat in the ocean by our two kid heroes, Emma and Noah.  (A ""mimzy"", we discover, is that cute stuffed bunny; it talks to the girl like a purring Teddy Ruxpin with an expansive but incomprehensible vocabulary.)  The package unlocks to reveal other treasures  -  a seashell that lets you hear way more in nature than the ocean, a set of levitating stones that produce a pretty light show, and a rectangular green crystal whose fractures, in the movie's neatest effect, seem to connect the entire world around you.  The kids change; Mimzy becomes Emma's constant nattering companion, eventually allowing her to levitate, while Noah draws elaborate Tibetan mandalas in his notebooks, no longer needs his glasses, and uses sonic waves to induce spiders to build elaborate web bridges.  (The Kirsten Dunst romance will have to wait for the sequel.)

For over an hour, though, all this neat stuff just piles up without explanation.  Most of it plays into the ultimate story, I suppose, but tangentally; without any answers in sight, all the detail and emphasis given by the movie on each separate power and effect only gets extraordinarily confusing.  (I choked at the dream sequence where Noah's building a star bridge out of little crystal sticks from an FPS viewpoint, shouting, ""Rhomboid!  Parallelogram!  Tesseract!"".)  The New Age terminology doesn't help, as we learn the kids are ""towzers"" (or something) destined to lead the world to enlightenment, with Noah an ""Engineer"" and Emma another special class of child.  (We discover this via a palm reading the movie invests with all the authority of a CAT scan; ""I've never seen anything so pure!"", gasps a yoga buff, and the music swells approvingly.)  The movie, meanwhile, is never any less than assured it's making sense.  Better to explain a little then advance the plot a little in turn, particularly with the material this movie asks us to handle.

Eventually (in the last twenty minutes), the story settles around Mimzy, whom the writers want to be seen as an E.T.-like character.  E.T., though, had a personality and interacted with others; Mimzy, despite her oblivious noisemaking, is just a doll being carried around.  All we see are Emma's progressive reactions to Mimzy, which are less than reassuring.  She parrots things Mimzy ""tells"" her that grow increasingly darker (not quite ""Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance"", but close); eventually, her own vibrant, happy personality subsides, consumed by what Mimzy says and Mimzy wants.  The mom gets concerned and decides to take Mimzy away, but, separated one second from the bunny, Emma shrieks and screams  -  not like a kid throwing a tantrum, but as if she were being assaulted.  If Stephen King hasn't written anything like this, he should've.  Eventually, Mimzy tells Emma that the world will end, like the bunny in ""Donnie Darko"", and it's only slightly less unsettling by this point.

Some have lauded ""The Last Mimzy"" as a kid's intro to science fiction; I'm hesitant.  I'd agree about the story at the very core of the movie, but it's dressed up with a lot of bad science  -  the concept of ""pure"" DNA from someone pure-of-heart, the idea that DNA wholly determines how one behaves.  The movie enthuses over science, but there's more to the field than distorted genetics and quantum physics.  Meanwhile, the New Age stuff argues against using logic to solve problems; characters are harangued when they distrust ""signs from the universe"", while every test to which the kids' eventual claims are put is a horror and question a betrayal.  (Also, again, as a story  -  as fiction  -  it's poorly structured.)

I'm not arguing against bad science in summer flicks or the ""heart over head"" moral.  ""The Last Mimzy"", though, addresses children, who don't have an adult's discernment, and tells them to apply its oddly-reasoned teachings to real-world problems.  And it's not ""we have a responsibility to our planet, and bad things will happen if this problem is not corrected""; it's ""if you don't believe us, then YOU'RE KILLING MIMZY.""  (And Mom and Dad and everyone else on Earth.)  Environmentalism is a crucial value to teach kids, but not through emotional blackmail and not through pseudo-religious material that, really, infringes on personal beliefs.  (Kids are told to put their faith not in friends or humanity but in specific totems like dreams and palm readings and mandalas, here divorced from their significance to Buddhism or any other conventional religion.)  It's also dishonest to invoke science as your patron saint, speak as if from a position of authority to kids, and then misrepresent it so recklessly.

There's good in ""The Last Mimzy"" that shouldn't be discounted.  It's beautifully shot and boasts some lovely beach locales and airy architecture.  It has some solid performers, like Joely Richardson as the mother and, when she's still allowed her own personality, Rhiannon Leigh Wynn as Emma.  Some of the powers it gives its kid heroes are inventive and keen.  There's no bodily-function humor.  It is, though, A What the Bleep Do We Know Adventure for Children, with all the perspective of New Age Sunday school.

Points for including one of ""The X-Files""' Lone Gunmen as an MiB, though.",1184803200,8,5718,4.955835962145111
2830463,3,B000Q66FB6,"This movie would more accurately be described as ""inspired by"" Mimsy Were the Borogoves, than ""based on"" (as used in the Amazon review). Therefore, I think there are two audiences for this and will address them seperately.

First audience are those of us who read and loved the Padgett work, and were hoping for a big screen version. If that describes you this is a zero star movie. It is not in the least faithful to the original, and skews toward childish cutsieness whenever possible. There is nothing plausible in any of the adults behavior, and the actors look like they're just going through the motions.

The second audience would be families looking for escapist fun. If that's you this is a family-friendly, harmless little movie, that's pretty to look at, with content appropriate for the 8-12 crowd (younger will be confused, older will be bored).",1184803200,16,858,4.86986301369863

The Last Mimzy did a great job of carrying us through a roller-coaster of emotions while unfolding an interesting, fun, and memorable storyline.

2830491,3,B000Q66FB6,"There's much to like in `The Last Mimzy'. With so many paranormal phenomena that skim across the story like a stone, much of the acting and directing make this pre-teen fantasy film laudably plausible, not an easy task given the shape of things. It must be conceded that the journey through crystals, palm readings, premonitions, and alien beings is an acquired taste, but for those who take such fare less seriously, the movie can be mesmerizing and rewarding.

We start with two pairs of prodigies: two are children, two are adults. Noah is a bright boy, and his sister, Emma, is gifted on the violin. Although disenchanted with school, his science teacher, Mr. White (Rainn Wilson of `Office' fame), takes a singular interest in him, and has his own dreams and premonitions of the `Medium' kind. His fianc&eacute;, Naomi (Kathryn Hahn) is an advanced palm reader. Both connect with the children as their discoveries cross astrological paths. In the meantime, the children's parents (Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson), David and Jo Wilder, piece together the unusual phenomena becoming apparent in their children's strange behavior and an exceptional science exhibit.

Noah and Emma really make their discovery at the beach front of their home. Looking upon the surf, Noah finds a box with a stuffed bunny and a crystal with patterns in it. Taking it with them, their bedroom toys come to life, especially with the stuffed rabbit named ""Mimzy"". Giving the children precocious skills to hear and see patterns, they become power sharers on the threshold of a powerful dream. Speaking of power, once they have the rites of communication via Mimzy, the alien conveys a message of great importance. Through a mishap, they enable bring about a visit from Nick (Michael Clarke Duncan), home security chief, who descends upon the Wilder home once they pinpoint the outtage source. It turns out that Mimzy, a time-traveler, is able to give her message to the authorities with a unique update of the ""Take me to your leader"" design.

`The Last Mimzy' is a smooth operator. There are so many elements which could have become tangled, and the story could have lost its clarity, but they manage to steer a clear course for the imagination. The need for a homeland security clampdown does more than a little 'E.T.' borrowing, and the communication to the paranormal is at least reminiscent of `Poltergeist,' another same-era Spielberg entertainment. Nevertheless, the manifestations and the genuine acting make this film more than a cut-and-paste phenomena. All the players give a sense of what would happen if these events really occurred, and the execution gives the tale a life of its own. The humor and social commentary are hardly retread. There's a jab at The Patriot Act, and there's enough dialogue to lighten up when necessary. It's good to see Timothy Hutton in more comeback roles, and Rainn Wilson gets to show more of his repertoire as a recognizable teacher. The children (Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) give essentially believable performances, and Joely Richardson is arguably the best of the bunch as a multi-faceted mom. 'The Last Mimzy' is sort of like 'The Fountain' for children, except planted on more solid ground and better realized.",1184112000,7,3255,5.0464684014869885

This is as close to a perfect science fiction film as anything that Hollywood is capable of: there is no gratuitous violence or promiscuous sex, no swearing and no blood and no death, no explosions or natural disasters or gunplay or swordfights or monsters or aliens or robots or mutants or cyborgs or comic-book-type-superheroes or mad scientists bent on world domination,  none of the things Hollywood likes to ruin science fiction with.  Instead good acting and flawless direction, coupled with special effects that don't overpower and dominate everything else in the film and a great--not good, but GREAT IN CAPITALS--story and a wonderful little moral message about not losing our fellow feeling for other people, the sort of social consciousness that no one could possibly object to.  If you have kids, buy this thing for your kids, then buy another one for yourself.  If you don't have kids, buy one anyways.  The film is adapted from a 1943 short story written by Henry Kuttner (one of the leading science fiction writers of the day) with his wife, Catherine (C. L. Moore the original Goddess of Dark Fantasy greatest unmitigated literary genius of the early twentieth century) who were then quite popular and influential but have in the decades since fallen into almost complete obscurity.  There is a book called ""The Last Mimzy"" which should be considered the essential companion to the film.  The story in the book is similar to, but not identical with, the story of the movie; and there are sixteen other stories in the book, all of them every bit as good (with most of their collaborative work, Ms. Kuttner declined a byline).  They wrote hundreds of stories, novels, and film, radio, and TV scripts under dozens of pen names.  Perhaps the best is ""Fury"", from 1947.",1183334400,78,2062,5.479495268138801

It contains some really amazing stuff that nobody is sure about, and the kids try and keep it secret, but slowly they learn more about it and, in the end, find out what needs to be done.

I have seen many movies in my lifetime. I have seen twilights of movies, I have skipped classes for the AMC theatre across the street, I have left pieces of my heart in a film reel. I have even studied cinema arts in college.

And throughout all of this film indulgance, i have always hated the question, 'what's your favorite movie?'. I love a lot of movies. Choosing a favorite would be like choosing a favorite child!

But I can say in all honesty that The Last Mimzy is indeed the best movie I have EVER seen. It was a breathtaking experience.

The very first scene struck an immediate chord within my heart, as I burst into tears immediately upon seeing it. I have always had issues with the school system and

I recognized this film as prophetic. It is not simply a science fiction movie. To me this was a message of hope to humanity; that we are beginning to awaken to our true power, and that we are capable of creating a truly harmonious sustainable society on planet Earth. It also highlighted the power of the children alive in these times, and calls for us to nuture these children and give them REAL educations as they are indeed the future of humanity.

As well, the movie was just plain fun! I was extremely activated by the knowledge that this film contained about energy and sacred geometry. Noah and Emma were absolutely adorable.. and I guess I identified much more with Emma than anybody else, because I hardly noticed the fear of the other characters until my 3rd time seeing the film.

I don't want to say too much about specific scenes, but this movie opened up many possibilities for me, and it also reminded me of my own cosmic heritage.

I highly recommend it to everybody.

I mean, if you're already there, then you won't care, of course, but, for the rest of us, this stuff is just plain weird.

******************** SPOILERS ********************

And it was totally unnecessary to the plot, since ABSOLUTELY NONE of the weird things that were happening to Emma & Noah turned out to be supernatural AT ALL -- so there was therefore ABSOLUTELY NO POINT to the chanting, the weird dreams, the mandalas, the tulkus, the ESP, the levitation, the telepathy & all manner of occultic ideas & practices.

And that business about a ""pure soul?"" Please. First of all, there's no such thing as a ""pure soul"" (unless you want to count Jesus Christ). And, second of all, how in the world could a material thing like DNA (which, in it's simplest form, is nothing but a code -- which implies a language; which implies a message; which implies a sender; which implies a Creator) convey the essence of a SOUL, let alone a PURE soul?! That's like sending a footless person an empty shoe so that they can better know what a foot is like ... Wha-huh?! Yeah, it didn't make sense to me, either, & I think that's why the movie ultimately ends up feeling so unsatisfying -- because it doesn't make sense.

And, as long as we're over here in spoiler territory, I might as well mention that there was absolutely NO point to showing the intimate scenes between the unmarried couple. Yes, such things happen, of course, but must we portray them so unabashedly in a KIDS' movie? And I thought the fact that the teacher introduced his girlfriend as his fiance was also in bad taste, since they had already been together for several years & were obviously NOT considering formalizing their relationship via matrimony, so that statement was just a bunch of hogwash (read: a LIE) -- but, hey, isn't that a GREAT way to subtly indoctrinate the little kiddies into the liberal, anything-goes lifestyle?

****************** END SPOILERS ******************

Acting-wise, I thought the kids were terrific, although their range of emotions seemed to be VERY limited (sending the message that that's what high-tech hocus pocus does to people?), because Noah seemed to continually vaccilate back & forth between worry & smugness & little Emma (who was extremely cute!) seemed to spend almost the entire movie either pouting, or crying, although (admittedly & thankfully) there were a few moments of childlike wonder (which you would EXPECT from a child her age).

The parents, however, were pretty flat (as they typically are in kids' movies -- through no fault of their own) & the mom was portrayed as an unappealing banshee (& you almost wished that something bad would happen to her ... )

I had read the short story that the movie was based on (""Mimsy Were The Borogoves"") & I enjoyed watching the trailer (although I did note several ""red flags"" in terms of elements that would conflict with my faith & my morality) & so I was HOPING that the movie would turn out to be so much better than it did ...
