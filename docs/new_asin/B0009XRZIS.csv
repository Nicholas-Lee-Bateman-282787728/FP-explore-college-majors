8069723,5,B0009XRZIS,I have been a Ray fan for years and have several musical performances of him ! But this is a great up close and personal glimpse of the True Ray ! This has some moments that are really special ( all the more now that he has passed ) Dick Cavett is the real reason as the show host that I just had to see what personal disclosure he could get from the one and only Ray Charles ! Anyone who has thought they knew Ray .......... needs to add this to their collection !,1353196800,2,465,3.905263157894737
8069724,5,B0009XRZIS,"The three shows in this series each have their own charm.

In the first one, there is a hilarious opening with Dick trying out a special effects motion machine. The Ray Charles segment that follows meets all expectations, and Ray and Dick's conversation after the music shows their growing rapport. Tony Randall, another guest, is very funny as he describes a provocative new California trend, and Margaret Mead says more interesting and intelligent things in her first ten minutes than most of us say all year.

In the second one, Dick and Ray have the show to themselves. The music is great, and the conversation is heartwarming and very much up to the usual Dick Cavett show standard of intelligence.

In the last show in the series, there are three guests. For those of us who remember Mayor John Lindsay, it is great to see him again. Those who are too young to have seen him before will be charmed and encouraged that a government leader can actually be intelligent. Again, Ray's music is stirring, and Dr. Sam Rosen, an ear surgeon is very interesting to listen to.",1182124800,16,1072,4.691489361702128
