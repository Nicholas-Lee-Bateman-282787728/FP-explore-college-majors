3518004,1,B001CT875S,"This is definately a one-of-a-kind flick and I'm not sure if I really liked it.  It had its moments (a few), but the relationship between Hank and Mike is really strange...not gay at all...they have their share of pretty women...but very strange.  The humor was subtle...not something you would laugh out loud about.  I guess the reason I gave it 1 star is that these two clowns wear their rabbit costumes throughout the entire film, even after they are fired from their jobs as Easter Bunnies.  The plot is thin, the acting is thin, and the humor is marginal.  Maybe this would be funny to the younger generation, but it just didn't have the fun or life I expected.  1 star...nothing more.",1269561600,,690,4.614754098360656
3518005,3,B001CT875S,"Sorry, I did not consume this low-budget stuff properly, perhaps.

If there was humour there, it is really not in murdering a manager by throwing him from the skyscraper window down.

The bunnies are so lazy they did not take off suits going sleep and making love.

Movie is as nice as the lowest price of $0.44 indicates.",1248480000,,322,4.517241379310345
3518006,5,B001CT875S,"I ordered this movie on cable not knowing what to expect, but not expecting much.  My girlfriend and I both ended up really enjoying it and laughing hysterically at many points in the movie.  I would caution those that do not like dark humor to look elsewhere.  That said, I think most folks will see the ridiculous humor in this movie for what it is - good clean fun.",1233705600,2,368,4.304347826086956
3518007,5,B001CT875S,Ha Ha! I love this movie. It suits my taste perfectly. It originally was a TV show on a public TV station in Canada. The guys who made it finally decided to make it into this gut bustingly funny movie. It's quite raunchy. (there's lots of cussing too) but it's a very funny movie all the same. Just don't let the kids watch it. lol (you can buy this DVD for just $6 if u get it used...) It's well worth the price to buy it.,1227398400,3,423,3.9302325581395348
3518008,5,B001CT875S,This movie is amazing. I saw a screening of it and I have never laughed so hard. It gives a whole new meaning to Easter and bunnies around the world. The two main actors are brilliant and I give this movie 2 thumbs up. Go out and get it!!,1222560000,2,238,3.877551020408163
8289160,3,B001CT875S,Pretty good. Was a region 4..which it did not say on the case but didn't really matter as I have an all region DVD player.,1525824000,,122,3.92
8289161,5,B001CT875S,really funny movie,1479254400,,18,5.333333333333333
8289162,5,B001CT875S,Those damn wabbit. This explains a lot.,1465516800,,39,4.714285714285714
8289163,4,B001CT875S,"I thought this was a really cool idea, and well played out.  It was amusing, but not laugh out loud funny for the most part.  The soundtrack was great!  I liked how original and independent it was.  But it was a little boring, some how the way the movie was made caused that.  It took alot for me to sit and finish it when my urge was to turn it off because it no longer was keeping my attention.  But over all, I liked it alot and am glad I took a chance on it.  Also, I enjoyed the special features.",1359936000,,501,3.900990099009901
8289164,4,B001CT875S,"I can't really describe it, It was an awesome movie. I loved it. It was a bit whacked and warped at times, but all around awesome. It's about friendship, life, perseverance, and not selling out your ideals for money. There is THE BEST love song ever in it.",1353888000,,256,4.354166666666667
8289165,5,B001CT875S,Hank and Mike is destined to become a cult classic.  It was beyond funny and worth every penny I paid for it.  I loved it so much I ordered a second copy as a gift.  Wilfred fans will love it.,1323475200,,192,3.75
8289166,5,B001CT875S,"I have no idea why this movie hasn't become more mainstream than it is, because it's awesome.
It's a hint of surreal made very real (as in moments you can so recognize and sympathize with) all rolled up in a huge ball of laugh yourself silly. I originally rented this movie and I haven't laughed out loud as much while watching a movie in quite a while so I decided this deserved a permanent spot in my movie collection. Still just as funny if not more so the second time. If you enjoy dark/silly comedy I would definitely recommend this movie. Not a story for children, though Hank might disagree.",1305072000,,598,4.445454545454545
8289167,3,B001CT875S,"The story starts out rather cleverly on Easter morning. It contrasts roommates, Hank and Mike on how they spend the night of their biggest day in their career. Mike is fast asleep in bed while Hank smokes cigarettes, drinks beer and abuses himself to a scrambled porno movie. Clearly they are the ""odd couple."" As fate would have it, they miss the last house on their route (they do a lot of breaking and entering). Since the company has opted to downsize, they find themselves out of a job. Now Easter Bunnies in the workforce is a funny thing. They work for UPS, but hide the packages. They work for a school and serve the kids chocolate. Unfortunately their work failures due to being an Easter Bunny is in the form of a montage and not really exploited to its comic potential. After Hank pawns Mike's Golden Egg award, the movie becomes dark as each one must now deal with their failure resorting to drink and drugs.

The bunny aspect no longer plays a role as they become any two losers and the movie becomes boring. It remains boring up until the very end when they devise a plan to get their jobs back.

Nudity, language, simulated sex (mostly in the first half). Decent soundtrack.",1285286400,,1189,4.525581395348837
8289168,5,B001CT875S,The movie is brilliant but I thought I would leave a small comment to say what a very complete DVD this is! The extras are extensive including making of and casting videos. Then there is the full audio commentary. There is even the original Hank and Mike series from TV included. Deleted scenes and bloopers. A real treat to get nearly everything the bunnies have done all on one disk.,1282003200,,385,4.514285714285714
8289169,2,B001CT875S,"I bought this film around Easter for some yuks with friends.
The cover photo, and trailer looked promising, BUT it was more a sad tragedy
than a funny bunny comedy.  There are some dark funny moments, but
overall its a long sad film about unemployed Easter bunnies, who fail
to find anything else they can do to make a living. Bunny boo hoo",1271808000,,340,4.396825396825397
