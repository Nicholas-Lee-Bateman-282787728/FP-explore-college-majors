8224302,5,B000WMRKDQ,"The best part of this tape is the Ann Warren segment, where she does all the beautiful, realistic-looking flowers (as opposed to the rather plain, stiff-looking flowers you see on most shop-decorated cakes .  Next best is Martha demonstrating basic techniques (basket weave, leaves, etc.) with the decorating bag and tips. The remaining segments are interesting as well.

The booklet is not essential. Cake recipes abound, and the Ann Warren buttercream frosting is in both her book The Cupcake Cafe Cookbook (which also has some useful tips for using and fixing this frosting), and in the February '96 issue of Martha Stewart Living. She also mentions quantities of ingredients on the tape, so you can get the recipe from it as well.

However, good as it is, it is not worth over $20 used--I bought it for $5 here on Amazon. I hope it will be re-released on DVD at some point in the future.",1202774400,6,891,4.735483870967742
