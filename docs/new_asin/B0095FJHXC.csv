5263083,5,B0095FJHXC,I liked watching the tv series now I have the collection on Dvd and I am looking forward to getting season 7 Vol 2 soon.,1353715200,,120,3.84
5263084,5,B0095FJHXC,I wasn't even born as yet when this show premiered but I love Perry Mason show. It is a show that the whole family can watch. Even my kids watch the show and they are only 12 and 15. It is very intriguing and full of suspense.,1352851200,2,226,3.8297872340425534
5263085,5,B0095FJHXC,"In the days ""Old"" when TV was... well, NBC, CBS, and ABC broadcast engineers would use a number of techniques to clean up errors in the production filming.  When Perry Mason was being broadcast, the networks would send their programs out via tight-beam microwave and telephone lines.  The video was transmitted using line-of-site microwave towers and the audio was sent via dedicated long distance telephone lines.  The video was OK, but the audio had a very limited bandwidth. It had a frequency response of about 100 to 5000 Hz (cycles per second), slightly better than what a telephone conversation would sound like.

The audio of these shows you are now watching on DVD seem to be poorly mixed.  Yes, they were probably getting sloppy in the 7th and 8th seasons when they printed the final copy.  But, they knew then the filtering effect of the long distance telephone line amplifiers would even things out.  That's why the music seems very bright and voices in comparison seem muffled. I don't think there was any effort on the part of the DVD makers to clean up the audio track much less one or two of the video tracks.

There are one or two episodes in the beginning of the DVD collection where the picture suddenly turns green or brown in several of the courtroom scene changes.  They were probably using a defective roll of film in one of the cameras.  You can see the picture change to green on one scene and then back to normal when it switches back to another scene.  During the original broadcasts, the video was sent out in black and white hiding this occurrence.  So, rather than reshoot the whole take, they left it up to the broadcast engineers to adjust for and filter out this problem.

Although the complete 18 volume set will end up being exceedingly expensive, something over $600 for all 9 seasons, the DVDs thus far have been good.",1352419200,21,1855,4.653374233128834
5263086,5,B0095FJHXC,"Wouldn't it be great if there more shows like Perry Mason on today rather than all of the T&A, foul mouthed and violent shows that have become the norm in today's T.V. offerings?  When I was a kid, every Thursday evening, our whole family gathered around the T.V. to watch Perry Mason.  We were usually joined by some of our neighbors since we were one of the few families in the neighborhood who owned a T.V. set. Perry Mason was/remains today a show that the whole family could/can watch together without worring about the content being inappropriate for the younger ones to watch. The incomprable Raymond Burr delivered a truly believeable performance as Perry Mason, a lawyer who in spite of District Attorney Hamilton Burger and his cohert the rascally Lt. Tragg, always managed to uncover the real perpetrators through factual evidence and solid reasoning.  He did so all the while keeping the audience guessing ""who done it?"" right to the end of each show.  Great entertaining and timeless T.V.  Highly recommended.",1349913600,43,1022,4.9186046511627906
5263087,5,B0095FJHXC,"For Perry Mason fans, the release announcement of Season 8 volume 1 is a sure sign that all entire nine seasons  will be released, after all.  For those who watch the series closely, you'll notice some subtle changes by the beginning of the eighth season.  Maybe the 1964- 1965 season reflects the world that changed after JFK's assassination in November 1963, but you'll see a bit edgier Perry Mason---more reflective of the contemporary world.  You'll also notice more close ups and changed lighting with the addition of cinemetographer John M . Nickolaus.  In terms of music, the early years of Perry Mason reflected the stock CBS music library--much of which was created by Bernard Herrmann in the 1950's.  Seasons 8 and 9 reflect specific music scored by Richard Shores.  Ray Collins (Lt Tragg) is only seen very rarely--even though his name  is listed in the credits of every show through the end of the 8th season-----he was suffering from emphysema and died in July of 1965.

Some say that the series best years ended by the seventh season.  I disagree.  The last two seasons were every bit as good, if not better.",1349481600,65,1122,4.791666666666667

5263112,5,B0095FJHXC,"Perry Mason Season 8 Volume 1

These fifteen TV shows from 1964 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The books are more complete and informative, they tell about life that is not experienced by most people. The books explain why some things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, how to evade surveillance, and avoid leaving a back trail. Some questioned the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but the stories were written before modern legal rules. The background tells about life in Los Angeles and America. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? Erle Stanley Gardner was a founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free the unjustly convicted. Gardner sought to use scientific means to find the guilty rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Some of the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent, but these films have a higher contrast than in earlier seasons. These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes are usually the Preliminary Hearings and often tell about the law. The cars tell of product placement. The titles begin with The Case of the .... Most are not from the novels except those with a year after the title.

5263125,5,B0095FJHXC,"It is amazing that Pasiano Productions was still chugging away after eight long years...and one more still to go after this.
By then, Raymond Burr was missing a few shows here and there - even in Season 6 he was out for a few weeks.  He was
tired, understandably, and in those days, they made an average of 36 shows per season, not 18-24 like they do nowadays.
The pace was fast and furious - and each episode was 52 minutes with commercials at that time.  But, not much of the momentum
of the early years had disappeared.  Everyone was still in fine form - great guest actors, and Perry, Paul, and Della were their usual great.
Ray Collins was long gone from the show, but his name appeared on the credits. By the end of this season, he was dead.
""The Case of the Missing Button"", with Julie Adams, Dee Hartford, and David Macklin was a highlight of Season 8.
I am glad the price on these DVD sets has come down.  When they were first released, they retailed for almost $50 for a half-season.
It stayed that way for quite awhile, but on Amazon the prices have always been reasonable.  I was not alive when this show aired - I was born a decade after it left the air and did not start watching it until it had been in reruns for 15 years.  But, it's always been my favorite TV show.",1443225600,,1282,4.233606557377049

5263180,5,B0095FJHXC,"This is a series of programs based a character in the writings of Erle Stanley Gardner. The CBS TV series stretched from 1957 through 1966.

Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) is a defense lawyer who is always thought of after it is too late for him to save the defendant from being accused of murder.  Supporting Perry is his trusty more than friendly but professional secretary Della Street (Barbara Hale). And their trusty and sneaky private investigator Paul Drake (William DeWolf Hopper, Son of the actress-turned-gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper). On the other side of the courtroom is the district attorney Hamilton Burger (William Talman) assisted by the not so neutral Homicide Lt. Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins).

You wonder how they get away with manufacturing evidence and the defendant usually has foot in mouth. Then there are the signature courtroom demonstrations.

Be sure to re-watch these programs as you can then see at even in TV programs they can sprinkle in subtle clues.

The was a mad magazine mock that had a boy scout immediately confess from the back of the courtroom upon seeing Perry mason.

Many of the subsequent programs allowed many TV actors of the time to become different characters and even replace the Burger and Tragg characters. You find yourself not only trying to outguess Mason but also saying ""Hey I saw that actor in...""

Even though the characters are from Erle Stanley Gardner the actual programs are written by many different TV writers of the day.

I have on occasion read some of the Erle Stanly Gardner Mason's and they are closely related. The TV version has a few less characters and has to write in some of our favorites.

The DVD's themselves usually have four episodes with a glaring lack of the extras that are so popular nowadays. The plus is that there are no advertisements.",1404518400,4,1820,4.883116883116883

By the last few seasons Perry was outright fat, Della was putting on a little middle age paunch, and Paul was riding around in big convertibles rather than running down sidewalks.

5263186,4,B0095FJHXC,"still a great show!!. The loss of Ray Collins (Lt Tragg) hurt this show as the banter between him and Burr was all so special.

But even without Collins this show was still very good. Some of the shows were a little confusing - and some took so long to set-up the story that the courtroom scenes were a little rushed - probably should have been some two-parters.

But this show, even though it was showing it's age, was still among the all-time shows of TV.

I would rate this show 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10!

Even though the show debuted before I was born, I remember watching reruns with my Dad as a little girl.. I didn't really understand the stories back then, I just knew that I loved Perry Mason and wanted to be Della Street when I grew up. so pretty, so perfect, so poised. The pros for Season 8..still deliciously black and white. Still has that film noir quality. The wonderful cars, outfits, hairstyles.. The cons, and there are several. No Lt. Tragg... at lest I haven't seen him  yet and I'm about 2/3 of the way thru both volumes. The stories are somewhat blase , I have to yet to find one that is really engrossing.. In every other season, there's been at least a few episodes that stand out, that I can watch over and over, a few that come to mind.. The Crimson Kiss, the howling dog, the crooked candle, the Calendar girl, the bigamous spouse, Double entry mind .. I have yet to find one really stand out episode in Season 8... but having said that, It's still Perry Mason and it's still worthwhile. Once I get all the way thru, I'll start to revisit some episodes. I do have to say though, a little disappointed with this season. Okay, I've gone thru all the episodes and there are few that I am really enjoying.. oddly , they all seem to be on the 2nd volume.. My favorites are The Golden venom, the Lover's Gamble, The Carefull kitten and the Duplicate Case.. The Sleepy slayer (volume 1) is also pretty good...",1375747200,,1560,4.360824742268041

5263210,5,B0095FJHXC,This is definitely recommended for Perry Mason fans. The strength of the Perry Mason series is how the writing by Jackson Gillis showcased the talents of the up-and-coming or over-the-hill guest stars. Actors stretching back to silent movie days and Broadway appeared on the series. That gives old movie buffs like me a chance to see them.

It has it's grainy moments but that is not the norm.  I watch this on an HD TV without any problems.

Perry Mason is a great TV series from the 50s & 60s starring a lawyer with those rare qualities of values and scruples, albeit make believe.  That is why we love this show.  When Perry began there was great deepth to each story and the court room was a large part of the story line.  As with most TV series the story weakens as the series progress and Perry is no exception.  Thus my giving it 4 stars.

Sometimes the mysteries are solved outside the courtroom, sometimes in a foreign country and once by Michael Connors as a San Francisco attorney pal of Perry, who is overseas at a conference, and Paul Drake. Sometimes the opening sequences introducing guest stars and situations run longer than usual with Perry and company entering the fray past the point where you mumble to yourself, ""Is Perry even in this one?"" However, he is and in some episodes finds himself in physical jeopardy. But PM is still going strong and real fans will enjoy these 15 episodes.

The footage is digitally restored, the soundtrack is loud and there are SUBTITLES, so you can watch the series when someone is trying to interrupt you (or at night when everyone else is in bed!)

The stories for Season 8 are a bit more melodramatic that the previous series, but it's still Perry Mason written by Earle Stanley Gardner.

I have been watching this as well on MeTV in the evening.  The DVD's are WAY better than the broadcast quality.  So rest assured, it is up to showing on your HD TV.

Aside from the consistent overall quality, and integrity, of the Perry Masoin series, it is great to see each new volume for the first time (in many years) This was a show that seemed to be able to sustain substance and appeal over its life.",1356307200,,334,4.661016949152542
5263261,5,B0095FJHXC,"All these programs were very good and were well written and acted. Ray Collins never appeared in Season 8 even though his name was listed in the credits. Ray Collins final appearance on Perry Mason was in Season 7, The Case Of The Capering Camera, January 16th, 1964. Even though Wesley Lau took over for him mostly Seasons 5, 6 and 7, he never had quite the superb acting ability that Ray Collins had brought to his character of Lt. Arthur Tragg. It was one of the finest law series ever produced for television.",1355702400,3,513,4.468085106382978
5263262,4,B0095FJHXC,"I am a huge Perry Mason fan. Love the show and have seen many of the early episodes numerous times. I had not seen many of the later (season 8 & 9) episodes and have to say there are some good episodes here but i do feel the show was missing or loosing something as this season began. First off the stories are very hard to understand. At times I found myself getting a little lost plus I noticed that the set up to the murder does not occur until 30 minutes into the episode leaving 20 mins for Perry to solve the mystery which at times seems a bit rushed. I just finished ""The case of a place called midnight"" and without a doubt this was the most diffuclt and boring episode of the entire series. I could not get into the story line and it seemed as if too much was happening too quick. Terrible plot and writing. I hope the remainder of the season and season 9 does not have episodes like this one because I will be downright disapointed. This series was one of the best in its early days. I can almost recite the early cases. They always held your interest and were more simplified to follow along with the story. I guess the writers and producers were moving into heavier story lines with the changing times or running out of ways to keep the series moving along. Sounds strange to say that because Law & Order SVU is now in its 14th year and not one week goes by that I don't find the show EXCELLENT.",1355356800,2,1407,4.176470588235294

They are in their late 80's and always look forward to the newest DVD releases.  They have already watched four of the shows from this collection and said they were great.

My folks look forward to the Ninth season's release in 2013.  The sooner the better.

8536129,4,B0095FJHXC,"I LOVE Perry Mason with Raymond Burr. Season 8 and 9 are not my favorite seasons but I had to buy it for the episodes I do include as favorites.

The best seasons are the early ones such as Seasons 1 through 4. Then I switch into favorite episodes mode. I will have all nine seasons shortly and be relieved not to be tracking the pricing of the different volumes of the different seasons. Whoever owns the rights to ""Perry Mason"" has made a fortune off all of us fans who may have first bought the VHS volumes and then have gone on to buy the DVD volumes. Clearly they knew they had a gold mine. I can live with that as long as I finally conclude my purchases.

And, yes, I can recite lines of dialogue before the actors say them. I also can identify the same houses used in different episodes as well as name the different episodes in which the same actors appeared. Thankfully I'm not alone in these endeavors!",1518048000,2,912,4.265895953757226
