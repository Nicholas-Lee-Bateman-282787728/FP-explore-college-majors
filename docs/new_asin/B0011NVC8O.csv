8241965,5,B0011NVC8O,"I really like this workout! I'm advanced and this is one of my favorite cardio kickboxing workouts. The choreography is easy to follow yet challenging, and it really makes me sweat.

I do cardio on my ""off"" days from weights & pilates, so I don't want heavy sculpting on my cardio days, and it seems like most cardio videos are now including way too much heavy sculpting to use on ""off"" days. This does the trick without too much heavy sculpting, but with a good cardio burn, for around 45 mins which is about the right duration.
My only problem is I'm now plateauing with this video and wish she would put out more DVDs like this.",1270512000,2,631,4.3931623931623935
8241966,4,B0011NVC8O,"I really like this DVD!  While I was not familiar with the instructor, the box states Lynn is a 3rd degree Black Belt, which is evident in her excellent form.  What's most enjoyable about this is her totally original combinations!  Prior to each combo she'll rattle off, ""Okay, now we're going to do ..."" and it reminds me of a cocktail waitress giving a list of drinks to a bartender.  Don't worry about it; you can get each one as soon as she starts it, and they're effective and just fun!

There's about a 10-minute warm-up, and then about an initial 20-minute workout, and then another 15-minutes done perfecting and extending the initial combos.  However, the basic combinations in both sets are pretty much the same.

I have only two negative points that keep me from giving it 5 stars.  The manufacturer calls the full workout 60 minutes long.  This cuts to the Cool Down at 45 minutes.  Sorry; I don't consider the Cool Down as much of a workout, and I think that's misleading.  I also think this will prove to be a workout that I will do only periodically, or else the relative repetition of moves in both portions would become boring.  But overall, this one's a keeper!",1205107200,5,1179,4.561904761904762
