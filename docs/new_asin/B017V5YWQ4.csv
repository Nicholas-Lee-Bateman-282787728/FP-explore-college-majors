8740744,3,B017V5YWQ4,"What I liked the most about it was just seeing how they wrote scripts in the 1930's.  The dialogue is so different than anything made in the past 40 years.  I also enjoyed watching the primitive special effects. So I'd say it was interesting as a sociological phenomenon.
Unfortunately I just don't think they did a great job of telling the story.",1490572800,,347,4.580645161290323
