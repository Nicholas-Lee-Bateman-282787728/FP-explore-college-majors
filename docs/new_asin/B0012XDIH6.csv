8248117,4,B0012XDIH6,"I actually got very pissed off at this movie, just like a couple of other people did on Fearnet.com.  However, I took time to think about what I just watched and realized it was one of the best foreign movies I've seen in a long time.  This movie is purposefully vague (or has a lot of loop holes) because it is posing the question ""where does fantasy end and reality begin?""  Basically 99% of this movie is complete fantasy-Leatherhead, Nosferatu, Clowns, prostituting mama and vampire/rebel daddy.  Fantasy is meant to be full of loopholes, vague and not make tons of sense.  The reality is the 1% at the end.  The over-imaginative, loner child comes from a very regular, normal and somewhat boring family.  By watching this movie, you step into her fantasy and skim the surface of her reality.  Although viewer discretion is advised, I am glad there was not a gratuitous amount of sex, which I find is a ""cop-out"" in many horror movies (especially those that suck).  The movie is great.  No-it's genius!",1239926400,,1006,4.6971428571428575
