The narration is OK, but the film used is not even related, in most cases, to the subject being discussed.  And the film clips used, are used again and again and again.  You get tired of looking!  Maps and diagrams would have helped greatly, but are almost never seen.  I would not recommend this dvd to anyone - look elsewhere for more informative material.  Also, the description states that this is a one disc unit, but the one I bought (which is the same as pictured) has 5 dvd discs.",1260057600,5,633,4.358974358974359
8326210,1,B00197XF7I,"This must be the worst ww2 documentary ever made !
 Just a guy who tells his comments on a subject with randomly chosen images from the period.
No maps, no time tables, nothing.
Some footage is even used 3 or 4 times within an hour.
Randomly used newsreels that even are situated on other parts of the world (France, London, Norway ????)

Terrible !!",1239926400,5,350,4.453125
