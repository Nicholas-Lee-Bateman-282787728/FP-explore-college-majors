8246469,4,B0012KHMX0,"Best of the four is the earliest, ""Our Wife"", a simple situation made impossibly complex by, guess who? - Stan; and Justice of the Peace, Ben Turpin. An intriquing entry from their ""surreal"" period. Laurel orders a rental for Hardy and slightly overweight fiancee to getaway on an elopement - he actually manages to have the vehicle in the right spot at the right time. Too bad the thing is really too small -for Stan! A compact car...to say the least!

""The Fixer Uppers"" is their next to last short subject, a near-classic with Mae Busch in a diffrent kind of role - as a neglected wife of Charles Middleton, she displays  vulnerability and softness, and a kind of melancholy desperation - she's even desperate enough to follow Stan's plan to make him ""jealous"". More situational than the first two-reeler on this VHS tape, it has a good flow.

""Them Thar Hills"" is one of their best, with all the troupers you need for a Classic L & H: Billy Gilbert, Mae Bush, Charlie Hall...and the Boys. Doctor Gilbert's ordrs are for Ollie to rest his stress-related gout in a quiet mountain retreat. Moonshiners' remains are the downfall here....plus rattled husband Hall.

This very popular above 1934 film brought about a sequel that year, ""Tit For Tat"" -
Stan and Ollie discover that their new business, an Electrical Supply Company is next door to Mae and Charlie's grocery (?). The contest resumes in a more urban setting.

One can imagine Hal Roach, Sr., hooking these two togerther and delivering a quality feature - and one much funnier than many in their series!",1271376000,7,1562,4.727941176470588
8246470,4,B0012KHMX0,"Some of the most entertaining films EVER and so hard to find...These are of very good quality, with prompt service from an independent seller. A couple technical glitches that don't really affect the films.  Until someone gets their act together and issues (and promotes) these treasures properly, this disc is a great way to go.",1231632000,9,329,4.9818181818181815
