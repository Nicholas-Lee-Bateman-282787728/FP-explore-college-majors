Have shared Simply Raw with many people, and this copy was for friends.",1375056000,,234,4.155555555555556

8469588,5,B005F3XV8A,I was really happy to be able to get these two videos as a unit.  The information is extremely important and is much easier to assimilate in this dual format.,1359417600,,158,4.266666666666667
8469589,3,B005F3XV8A,"it's great. I switch to raw and able to control my glucose well. from 180 to 100-120
I find the simplyraw to be motivating and eye opening
I really can't believe it works. (back then... now i do ofcourse)

However I think raw for life is not as helpful.
once we know that eating raw help, there's other much better resources.

I recommend to just get the ""simply raw"" on it's own and save $30 to buy books on raw cooking. Simply will supply you more knowledge and dish choices on your raw cooking adventure. If you like videos to help you cooking, theres few channels is youtube you can follow. Raw cooking people are posting new way to prepare their food daily.

stay raw, stay healthy, live long
