4307327,5,B004AE3QY4,"Grief is an individual process. There is no one way experience it. It's not a scheduled allotment of time; it could begin directly after a tragedy, but then again, it could begin five years later, or ten, and it's going to last for as long as it's going to last. Some people have the coping skills to move on. Others remain in despair for the rest of their lives. Is the former the right way to go about it? I don't know. Coping skills could refer to anything. If one person finds solace in friends, family, or faith, another person invariably takes comfort in an emotional vacuum of his or her own creation. They may plunge into work or distract themselves endlessly with personal projects. They may even abandon their lives altogether and then delude themselves into believing that nothing bad ever happened.

""Rabbit Hole,"" an adaptation of David Lindsay-Abaire's Pulitzer Prize winning play, is about the different ways people experience grief. It doesn't coerce the audience into accepting a preconceived notion of loss and mourning. It presents the characters as they are, and never once are judgments made about them. Rather than address the audience in conventional absolutes of misery or hope, it instead sends the message that, regardless of what hand you've been dealt, life comes with no guarantees. It's all about living one day at a time; it's pointless to dwell on what might happen tomorrow or the next day or a decade from now. It's not the best solution, but it's the only solution there is. It's reality.

The film centers on Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart), whose four-year-old son, Danny, was killed after being struck by a car. A lesser film would have opened on a note of unremitting bliss, mom and dad happily caring for their young son in their suburban New York neighborhood; we would then have to endure the soppy melodrama of both the accident and the funeral, which would no doubt be held on a rainy day and feature lots of close-ups of Becca's tear-stained face. But this isn't a lesser film. The story begins eight months after the accident. There's no graveyard. There's no memorial site. It's just Becca and Howie, who have since settled into a functioning but incredibly strained routine.

They're not on the same page when it comes to their son's death. Becca, while seemingly sensible and conscientious, is not allowing herself to feel and is subconsciously trying to erase all physical evidence that her son existed. That isn't easy in the house of a four-year-old; there are dozens of school paintings, a closet full of clothes, a completely furnished room stuffed with toys, and fingerprints on cabinets and doors. Even the family dog was too much for her to handle, for it played a part in her son's death. Howie is not the kind of person who wants his son's life erased. He's especially fond of a video stored on his cell phone - presumably the last footage of him ever shot. Howie is ready to rekindle a physical relationship. Becca is not. Howie takes Becca to group therapy sessions with other parents who have lost children. Becca is not at all interested in what they have to say and sees no point in participating.

Becca's sister, the irresponsible Izzy (Tammy Blanchard), is pregnant and often the target of Becca's resentment. Their mother, Nat (Dianne Wiest), tries to be the voice of reason but fails to understand why her daughter refuses to let anyone comfort her. She too has been down that long, dark road of grief, but every time she tries to explain where she's coming from, Becca refuses to listen, believing that the comparison is cruel and unfair.

Howie seeks out a kindred spirit and finds one in Gabby (Sandra Oh), who has been attending the group therapy sessions for the past eight years. Becca, in turn, forms a very unlikely friendship with Jason (Miles Teller), a high school student who was driving the car that killed her son. He's far from a sadistic monster. He's consumed with guilt. His coping mechanism is a comic book he's writing and illustrating on his own, one in which multiple universes and time/space portals called rabbit holes advance the plot.

Of all the films I've seen this year, none have been as believable, as powerful, or as resonant as ""Rabbit Hole."" It's brilliant in that it never tries to tell us what to think or how to feel. It doesn't make assertions about who's right and who's wrong. It presents people as they actually are in a grieving state; whichever side we choose - and naturally, we will choose - is dependent not on the filmmaker's motives, but solely on what we personally bring to the film. The performances are amongst the most compelling of any recently given. A movie this good deserves more than a place on a critic's top ten list. It also deserves special attention from audiences, for as of now, they're unlikely to come across one with a better understanding of human nature. This is one of the year's best films.",1292544000,2,4948,4.747674418604651

4307352,5,B004AE3QY4,"Not to mention remarkably moving. I had a feeling about this one, ever since I found it for a few bucks on an outlet store shelf. It was one of those movies i'm only in the mood for at certain times, and today happened to be that day. Rabbit Hole is one of those movies that's all about character. Character and mood. We basically see a random stretch of time in these character's lives, and the performances are so well done we really do feel we know these unfortunate people, and we're also kinda happy we ain't these unfortunate people.

Rabbit Hole is a great movie because, despite it being a slow-paced, character-based story, there's not a split second that didn't have me immersed. Also, the movie is quite mature for its pg-13 rating, which is another thing to applaud. It's just a really well made movie that really hits on a deep level. It's quite sad, but sad stories deserve to be told too.",1473984000,,903,4.472727272727273

4307395,4,B004AE3QY4,"Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckart are perfectly matched for well acted tale of a couple learning to cope with the recent loss of their young son. Both Kidman has isolated herself and suppressed her emotions. Eckhart who also feels the loss the loss deeply cannot express his feelings due to Kidman's prickly and withdrawn behavior. He finally gets the nerve to tell Kidman he too suffered the loss, something she could not acknowledge.

Echart tries unsuccessfully to get both into a grief counseling group for those who have lost a child. Kidman gives up on it. Another couple who have been going to counseling for years, much to the dismay of Kidman and Eckart, eventually go their separate ways. The wife befriends Eckhart who now attends the meetings separately and the two seemingly are headed for an illicit relationship.

At the same time, Kidman proactively engages the teen who was driving the car that hit her son. Eckhart reacts negatively to her trying to befriend him. ""He killed our son."" But this relationship proves key to Kidman's recovery.

I will not spoil the story and offer more. The story is moving as it shows the twists and turrns, ups and downs normal people take as they heal and try to regain a life without a most loved member of the family, their child.

4307444,5,B004AE3QY4,"RABBIT HOLE stars Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart as a married couple.  The couple lives in an upper middle class house somewhere in Connecticut.  In a nutshell, the couple had lost their 4-year old son to an automobile accident.  The child had ran into the street, and was run over by a teenager, played by Miles Teller.  The entire film concerns this couple's grief, and the fact that the grief continues to materialize in unexpected ways, and in unexpected times and locations.  The unexpected times and locations occur during  a visit by prospective buyers of their house, in an aisle in a supermarket, and while Kidman is parked alone across the house of the teenaged killer (Miles Teller).

OPENING MOMENTS.  The film opens, showing Nicole Kidman (""Becca"") gardening in her back yard.  She rips open a bag of potting soil, and plants a row of colorful flowers.  ""Becca, Becca"" calls the neighbor, an older upper middle-class woman.  ""It looks so nice back here.  Listen, we were wondering if you and Howie are free to come over for dinner.  We're having a few people over.""  ""That's so sweet"" answers Kidman, ""actually we have plans"" (she really does not have any plans).  ""I'm so sorry"" says the older woman, when she accidently steps on one of the flowers.  ""We'll do it again next time,"" says Kidman.  ""Say hi to Howie for me,"" says the older woman.  ""I sure will,"" answers Kidman.  The conversation is chipper and light-hearted, and the viewer will not suspect the mental scars that are continuously torturing Kidman and Eckhart.

INITIAL HINTS & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  The movie plants subtle hints, as to the issue with Kidman and Eckhart, but for the first 15 minutes the viewer will not be able to determine that these hints relate to the fact that the couple lost their child.  The husband (Eckhart) comes into the kitchen.  It is evening.  He is almost as handsome as Kidman is beautiful, and he resembles Viggo Mortenson.  Then, the next scene is in the daytime, and Nicole is shown at a police station at night bailing out her sister.  The sister had been in a brawl in a bar.  ""You can't be doing this, you're not a kid any more,"" scolds Kidman, trying to set her sister on the right trail of life.  ""I didn't know there was a cut-off date,"" replies the sister, in a friendly retort.  In the next scene, Kidman sees her husband in the darkness of the livingroom, watching a video (on his cell phone) of his 4-year old son.  But at this point in the movie (at six minutes), the viewer still does not know that the son died, but this particular video which is on a cell phone, is the source of a major emotional outburst that takes place much later on in the movie.  In the next scene, which is daytime, Kidman scolds her sister with, ""You're sleeping with the girl's boyfriend!!!""  ""It's been over between them,"" explains the sister, "". . . they're just living together because of the rent.""  (At this point in time, the viewer will realize that the sister is really stupid.)  Then, Kidman asks, ""Then why did she accost you,"" referring to the barroom brawl.  ""Because she's a lunatic,"" answers the stupid sister, "". . . and I'm pregnant!!!""  ""You are not,"" retorts Kidman in disbelief.  ""How long have you known him,"" asks Kidman.  ""A few weeks,"" replies the stupid sister, good-naturedly.

THE REAL PLOT BEGINS.  At eleven and a half minutes into the movie, the real story begins (no more preliminaries).  Kidman and Eckhart are walking down a hallway, perhaps in the basement of a church, and they enter a room with a half-dozen couples.  It is a support group for parents with dead children.  ""How long have you been in group,"" asks Eckhart, to one of the couples. ""It'll be eight years this June,"" the man answers.  The man's wife is Sandra Oh, who one might recall was in the delightfully fun movie, UNDER A TUSCAN SUN.  The couples are in a circle, and one husband sobs and talks, ""She visits me sometimes in dreams and tells me its a good day,"" referring to his dead daughter.  ""We just have to remind each other that it is part of God's plan,"" the man continues.  ""God had to take her, he needed another angel,"" explains his grieving wife.  ""He needed another angel,"" repeats the husband.

Then Nicole Kidman exclaims, ""Why doesn't he just make one, another angel?  He's God after all, why doesn't he just make another angel?""  Then, Kidman exclaims ""HMMM?"" in a manner that is snooty and confrontational.

At this point, all of the other couples are silent and they all give Kidman a hard stare.  Kidman rolls here eyes, smiles coyly, and whispers to her husband, ""I think we have to go!""  The next scene is takes place immediately thereafter, and it is in a fancy restaurant.  ""They're talking, its their time and you have to respect that,"" scolds Eckhart, who disapproves of his wife's snooty remarks.  ""I'm sorry, I can't stand the God freaks,"" explains Kidman, "". . . you know that.""  Eckhart replies, ""But they're not all like that.  Kevin and Gabby (Sandra Oh) aren't.""  But Kidman is still more interested in entertaining herself by making snooty remarks, and less interested in empathizing, and she retorts, ""No, Kevin and Gabby are professional wallowers, eight years . . . EIGHT . . . if that's what you want to become!""  Okay, that's about it.  There is no need for me to summarize the entire story.  I'll just add that, as the film continues, the plot reveals that Kidman's mind and Eckhart's mind become progressively more and more messed up, and they both suffer from emotional breakdowns.

ABOUT MILES TELLER.  Miles Teller plays the teenaged driver who accidentally had killed the 4-year old boy, when the boy ran into the street.  His face looks like a mess, and this is partly because he has real scars from a near fatal car accident a few years before the filming of RABBIT HOLE.  Miles Teller's face is covered with moles, and I think that this is makeup, and it is my guess that the reason for the moles is to establish that he is a pathetic character.  Towards the end of the picture, Nicole Kidman reaches out to Miles Teller, because she thinks that becoming Teller's friend will in some way alleviate her own grief.  Teller responds by giving her a book of colorful drawings that he'd just completed.  It is my guess that the goal of the moles, is to establish that Kidman's interest in the teenaged boy was not sexual, but was entirely because of Kidman's goal of reducing her level of grief.  The name of the book of colorful drawings is RABBIT HOLE.  Miles Teller has been in about 20 movies.  In RABBIT HOLE, he plays so very perfectly the role of a teenaged boy who is somewhat nerdy, and not very good at talking, and not very good at conversation.

ANOTHER EARTH.  Another film that uses and develops the same theme is ANOTHER EARTH starring William Mapother, cousin of Tom Cruise.  ANOTHER EARTH co-stars Brit Marling.  Please see my review of this film, on Amazon.com.  William Mapother plays the grieving parent.  Brit Marling plays the teenaged girl who accidently killed William Mapother's children and wife in an automobile accident.  Brit Marling's goal is to reduce her grief level, by initiating and developing a friendly relationship with William Mapother.  Please note that in ANOTHER EARTH, William Mapother does not know the fact that Brit Marling was the killer, until the very end of the movie.  FIVE STARS for this film too.",1454284800,,7401,4.670797831138652

4307460,4,B004AE3QY4,"I was recently browsing my local library's DVD section in search of a good movie to watch, and fell upon this. I was trying to remember whether I had seen this before, surely I must have? But I couldn't recall and as a result I picked up the DVD. So glad I did.

""Rabbit Hole"" (2010 release; 91 min.) brings the story of a married couple Becca and Howie. As the movie opens, we see Becca working in the yard. Her neighbor stops by to invite the couple over for dinner, but Becca turns her down. ""I'm so sorry"" whispers the neighbor. We also get to know Howie, as we catch him looking at video footage. It is the couple's 4 year old little boy, whom we learn was killed in a car accident. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is directed by John Cameron Mitchell, best known for his theater and movie role in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", but to be honest, ""Rabbit Hole"" is a labor of love from Nicole Kidman, who also produced this. Without her, there would be no movie, period. The focal point of the movie is the enormous stress on the couple's marriage resulting from their son's death. Howie (played by Aaron Eckhart) desperately wants things to come back to normal, but Becca is not at that point. ""Things aren't nice anymore"", she hisses, after rejecting Howie's moves for love-making yet again. In a parallel story line, we also see the strained relationship between Becca and her mom (played beautifully by Dianne Wiest), who as it turns out also suffered the loss of a child, but in very different circumstances. There are a couple of other twists to ""Rabbit Hole"" which I won't reveal... Bottom line: this is a superb relationship drama, in which Nicole Kidman brings one of her very best performances of her long and rich acting career, and that's saying something. ""Rabbit Hole"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1451433600,,1920,4.546242774566474

I'm glad I watched it. The actors do an excellent job of showing the effects of grief without going overboard and becoming maudlin. It would be simplistic to say the message of the movie is ""Life goes on"" but that is basically it. Terrible things happen, but you get through them. They change you, your life is never the same, but you adjust to your new reality however you can. To say this movie is ""upbeat"" would not be accurate but when it comes to movies about couples who experience the death of a child, it is certainly more positive than most, especially at the end. I don't often give four stars. This movie deserves them.",1447977600,,806,4.452702702702703

The husband was grieving in his own way but was a bit more mature and willing to reach out to others who experienced loss.

However, as far as being a true life story, with nuances, reality, and which tells a complex story in a superior manner, this is it.  I am not a real weepy kind of person at movies, but this one moved me to tears.  It was so real, you could feel the pain.  I never experienced a child loss, so I do not understand it fully.  But I got a good glimpse of it during the movie.  I had a friend of mine sadly lose a sibling at the age of 24 years.  Many of the same things that I saw in the movie happened in their family.  This isn't some sappy Lifetime movie where you get one outburst and everyone lives happily ever after.  This is a real story about marriages and the toll any loss takes on them.  It is about the complexity of families, mothers and daughters, siblings, etc.  Very well done.  And very well acted.  I am surprised this movie did not get much Academy Award love, it was certainly worthy of it.  I highly recommend if you want to see a ""real"" story.  I also highly recommend it if you know a family who has lost a child.  It is important to understand what a family really goes through, and this shows you.",1446422400,,1197,4.051282051282051

They are lost in their own form of grief and pulling further and further away from each other..  No one should loose a child.  How she handles her grief was just amazing. I thought for sure she would put all the blame on the person that caused the accident but what she did and what it did for her had me in tears.  Tears of forgiveness.  After watching this movie I can see why so many marriages fall apart after the death of a child.,1441584000,,541,4.153846153846154

The characters in this movie have to cope with death, and they talk about how they are handling it, and they deal with it in different ways.

I could feel the pain and sadness and loss and emptiness and anger and loneliness and guilt and frustration and senselessness.

I loved this movie, and especially the ending, because it was all so ""real"" - - there was NO miraculous happy ending which tied everything up neatly so that suddenly everything and everyone is all better and all happy and all hopeful - - it was wonderful to see a movie about the subject of death that felt so real without all of the fake promises at the end.  At the end, everyone was dealing with death in almost the same way that they were dealing with it at the beginning, which I loved because it was real, because like one of the characters said, ""It never goes away.""

This movie was very inspiring to me because I felt like it gave the message that however you feel is okay, and your feelings are important and you have a right to them.",1438819200,,1063,4.321608040201005

4307720,4,B004AE3QY4,"This movie was a moving story about the depth of pain in loosing a young child.  The strain that the couple experienced in their individual expressions of loss put distance between the husband and wife, taking you into their hearts.  While I have never experienced this, it transported me into their individual struggles making it personally real.  At the conclusion, both husband and wife come to terms with their grief and no longer struggle against each other but reconnect in their combined experience.  The story progressed into a strengthening of their relationship by working through a very emotionally, challenging time.  I gave it four stars not because of it's content but, because it isn't really a movie that I would ordinarily choose.  If you have experienced this type of loss, it may be worth watching.  In the end they resolve their feelings and move forward together by  . finding emotional peace and a strengthened relationship in having endured the shared experience.",1437177600,,986,5.080745341614906

4307800,4,B004AE3QY4,"Becca is still throbbing with grief.  And she is done with advice, and support groups, and she wants another answer, whereas, her husband, Howie still wants to try.

Becca is cynical and yet practical.  She tries to absorb herself in other stuff, and yet, no matter how hard she tries, you sense that her chest is on the cusp of combusting.  She wants something better.  She does want to pretend.  She does not want distractions or decoys, which is why she seeks out Jason, who accidentally hurt her son.

Howie still wants to believe.  He goes to support groups but he goes home and watches videos of his child helpless, almost as if to torture himself.  He is tempted to have an affair, but he stops himself.  Because despite his pain, he holds on.

This family will make it.  But not without immense pain.

You feel for them.

Nicole Kidman is amazing as always.  I've never seen her do anything is bad, no matter how diverse her roles.  You feel she is always holding something in, on the cusp of tears and rage.  She wants to heal.  She ignores her surroundings.  She is not necessarily in love with her husband, which is why she seeks something else.  It is Howie, in love with her, who stops, though he wants relief.

4307839,4,B004AE3QY4,"Oscar winner Nicole Kidman and Oscar nominee Aaron Eckhart play Becca and Howie, a suburban New York City couple, whose only child, Danny, died eight months prior. They are struggling to survive and rebuild their lives and marriage.

This film is based on the Broadway play by David Lindsay Abaire. The movie is about 90 minutes long with an all star cast featuring Emmy winner Tammy Blanchard as Becca's sister and Oscar winner Dianne Wiest as the mother. Emmy winner Sandra Oh plays a grieving mother in a support group for bereaved parents.

As the film unfolds, we watch Becca and Howie rebuild their lives and survive as childless parents surrounded by memories and regret. The film isn't as sad as it might appear to be. There are some light moments and a sense of hope in living again.

This film is not for everyone but it is a character driven low budget film where actors use their talent to display quality work. The film can be uplifting at times. I only criticize the ending where it seems abrupt and vague about Becca and Howie's marriage and life.

The DVD adds only a few deleted scenes. I wished they added more about the stage to film adaptation; a word with the director, playwright, and cast members. Nicole Kidman produced and acted in this film production. This film was very low budget and didn't earn much at the box office. Films like this don't get made because they're viewed as unprofitable. It is shame because I much prefer character driven films than superheroes any day.",1435363200,,1502,4.678030303030303

The scenes between Becca (Kidman) and Jason (Miles Teller) are just heartbreaking.  He is simply astounding.  I had never seen him in anything before this.  And Kidman is very good; very understated and very real.

Watch the scene where he tells Becca ""I might have been going too fast.  On that day.  I mean, I'm not sure."" and I dare you not to lose it.  He's a revelation.  Very good film.",1433808000,,568,4.355769230769231

They kept secrets from each other and pushed each other away and sought comfort in other things. The only healing I saw was their holding hands at the end. Everything else in the movie was this couple bringing down their family and friends with them in their grief.

4308069,3,B004AE3QY4,"""Rabbit Hole"" is a well done picture from 2010. It is currently available on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The director is John Cameron Mitchell. The writer is David Lindsay-Abaire for both the screenplay as well as the play. John Cameron Mitchell's piece is the most simple film of the year, yet one of the best. Please do not confuse simple with simplistic. It's a rather complex turmoil of emotions that come together to provide an intense account of a couple coping with their son's death. However it is done in such a clean and polished manner that one might wonder if the secret of success lies on the ""simple"" process of feeling the imagery and capturing the visual style. It's extremely effective and gives room to the actors do what they do best. Rabbit Hole is not about the loss, but how to cope with it and how hard and emotionally heavy it can be. Through day-to-day actions people try to forget, believing that the solution lies on the non-existence, but the truth is that facing reality is much more efficient. Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart prove that point by engaging the audiences in the dimension of their loss through significant and remarkable character development. This is to say that their performances are astounding, but much more important than that they don't feel like performances: they feel real. Though it may be hard to avoid getting into the field of sentimentalism, both actors manage to escape the melodrama and focus on what is real: going to work every day, cleaning the house, going to group therapy, baking, playing squash, reading In the process there is an intrinsic desire to confront the situation, but it's too hard. It becomes physically painful and intellectually devastating. Men and women are different to the extent of physical appearance since when it boils down to the bare essential, the human being just wants one thing: to cope with their existence. It's not about sex, procreating, loving it's accepting that people die. I gave it 3 stars. Dale Haufrect",1432857600,,2017,4.88338192419825

4308088,4,B004AE3QY4,"There are things that happen to us in life that can never truly be shared by others through empathy. A parents grief from the loss of a child must be at the top of this list.

Attempting to write a screenplay for this seemingly emotionally untouchable material, without producing an overwrought, or psychologically weary story, cannot be easy. Directing its actors must be in perfect tandem with the same caveats.

In Rabbit Hole, screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire, based on his play of the same name, this  emotional balance is achieved with a pitch that sustains just the right tone for almost all of the film. Clearly, Lindsay-Abaire was the only person to adapt his play to the screen, and John Cameron Mitchell was the man to direct it.

This is Nicole Kidmans film, and her performance impressed me as one of the best I have seen of anyone suffering, agonizing, adapting, and adjusting in all the clumsy and human ways we do, when challenged to overcome profound loss in our lives. She was rightfully nominated for the Oscar for her work here. The one nod to a supporting role is Miles Teller, as Jason. The few moments he shares on screen with Kidman are perfectly written, directed, and acted.

Rabbit Hole is a melancholy presentation. Its pace is a slow and methodical viewing of parental grief and deep angst, but thats just what it is in reality. Just because its a movie with a hollywood budget, doesnt mean the starkest elements of the story cant be good enough on their own. They are when they are in the right hands.

All the main people who brought this production to the screen gave it the touches it needed to become, perhaps, a definitive dramatic benchmark.",1431993600,,1679,4.6938775510204085
4308089,5,B004AE3QY4,"Very heart wrenching. I can't even begin to fathom the pain and suffering parents or grandparents feel when a child is taken from them either by accident or illness.

The lead actors Nicole Kidman and Arron Eckhart were so believable. My heart ached for the teen who was responsible.

I don't know how I'd react or survive such an ordeal however I imagine each individual handles it the best way or the only way they can.

 It was riveting and I could see several scenarios that could happen to this couple, which is not the norm, but was glad they came to a place where they could comfort each other. It reality most couples cannot conquer their guilt and it usually ends the marriage or relationship.",1431993600,,702,4.5476190476190474

4308096,4,B004AE3QY4,"What can I add that 145 reviews hasn't already covered?  This movie and cast portray loss and coping with it in believable realism.  Don't expect to be uplifted by this movie.  Perhaps this is obvious, considering the topic is related to Becca & Howie loss of their young son and how they deal with this loss.  The only disappointment in this movie is the portrayal of religious folks dealing with grief as immature and naive; although this is fairly standard for Hollywood productions.  However, Kidman's rage against child-like faith in God does strike an accurate response of many people experiencing such loss in our modern culture (i.e. anger at a God she doesn't believe exists).  If you're secular, agnostic, or an atheist you might find the overall theme of the movie redemptive; however, if you're a believer in the Christian God, then you will see that the aspect of faith and grieving is  in a parallel dimension that is not part of the world of this movie.",1431907200,,968,4.7604790419161676

4308103,5,B004AE3QY4,"This movie, about parents trying to go on with their life after the death of their 4 year old, shows some of the faces of grief. We recognize that a tragic loss is going to be very complicated and emotions will be all mixed up. For some they will be completely shut down. Sudden loss of a loved one probably always generates anger, as it did for the couple in the story. I resonate with that and I feel this move gave me a rare opportunity to witness a struggle to adjust to deep loss. I also recognize that after the death of a loved one there is an emptiness. This movie somehow managed to touch that emptiness. It also reveals that tragedy can open up love and beauty as well. It stirred my own heartaches and reminds me that heartbreak may lead to hardness for protection or to tender heartedness. I'm glad I watched this movie and I also feel brave for being willing to look into the face of grief.

It's good to see Aaron Eckhart (""Erin Brockovich,"" ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Love Happens"") cast in a role worthy of his abilities. He isn't a second banana this time and he certainly holds his own.

Eckhart and Kidman play a happily married couple whose four-year-old son was killed in an accident in front of their house. When we join them eight months later, things haven't improved very much. She is fed up with their grief therapy group and starts trying to cope in different ways ...one of which is to stalk the teen-aged driver who killed her boy.

Besides Eckhart and Kidman, we see:
  * Sandra Oh (""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Sideways"") who has attended those group sessions for eight fruitless months.
  * Dianne Wiest (""Dan in Real Life"") is Kidman's mother, who has also suffered the death of a child.
  * Tammy Blanchard (lots of TV) is Kidman's free-spirited sister, who has just become pregnant.
  * Miles Teller (soon in the ""Footloose"" remake) is the hapless teenager who drove that car.

Of course there are assorted co-workers, friendly neighbors and concerned family members as well, but our focus is on these two stricken people who are basically decent folks. (Although I watched her make pie crust and... Oh my dear...)

I had the sense that writer David Lindsay-Abaire (who won both a Tony and a Pulitzer for the original stage play) has had first-hand experience with this sort of loss. The emotional arc and some of the statements ring very, very true. And to watch two people get the giggles in grief therapy was perfect! Kind of like the funeral for Chuckles the Clown in the old Mary Tyler Moore show.

4308153,5,B004AE3QY4,"The other day somebody advised me to watch the film Courageous. I took their advice. Partially.

We started to watch the film. But then forty-five minutes into it we realized that Jon Stewarts The Daily Show was about to begin. So

In other words, the film suffered from the most devastating of cinematic crimes: mediocrity. It wasn't good enough to draw our minds into its world and away from the nightly TV listings, and it wasn't bad enough to keep us hooked with its sheer awfulness. Rather, its script and acting felt like it was about the level of an average sitcom without the laugh track (and, save, one scene, without the laughs as well).

And that is not all. Courageous is a Christian film. And Christian film is typically code for overtly didactic. This was no exception. In the portion I saw characters in the film repeatedly stressed the need for fathers to be good fathers to their children. The script-writing was so ham-fisted I half expected the actors to look directly into the camera as they were delivering their hortatory lines. In fact, the film felt like an elaborate Campus Crusade for Christ skit on fatherhood. Subtlety is definitely not the strong suit of evangelicals.

The central event in the portion of the film I watched is the untimely death of a beloved daughter in a car accident and the father learning to deal with his grief. As I mused about how poorly this was presented I was led to reflect on another film which covers some of the same ground. Rabbit Hole came out two years ago. It is a fantastic film, but along with Buried and United 93 it is one of the heaviest films I have watched in the last five years. The sense of desperate grief is stifling.

The film stars Nicole Kidman as Becca Corbett in an Oscar nominated performance. Beccas husband (played by Aaron Eckhart) is desperate to reach out to her and save their marriage. But daily both bereaved parents are being water-boarded by their own guilt, and their seething rage at the other. This family is gripped by so much pain that even now I find a sense of anxiety settling in just to recall it. In Courageous God is the sometimes-hard-to-understand-but-always-quietly-abiding-benevolent-presence. In Rabbit Hole he is a cause of skepticism and unvarnished outrage. Not surprisingly I resonate better with the theology of Courageous but in terms of a depiction of agonizing loss, Rabbit Hole is the truer film by light years.

As I pushed stop on the control I mused over the fact that Courageous received an outstanding A+ Cinemascore from its audience. I must say that didn't impress me. After all, if you survey people who had just purchased two buck Chuck (Charles Shaw Winerys fabled two dollar bottle of wine) I guarantee youd get a disproportionately high grade. Not surprisingly that is widely reflective of the expectations and demands of the customer base. Charles Shaw markets to an audience that is satisfied with a two dollar bottle of wine. And Courageous is marketed to an audience that is satisfied with a two hour Campus Crusade for Christ skit. Fair enough. It is a free country.

What bothers me is not that people pour themselves a glass of two buck chuck. Rather, it is that they think they aren't missing something when they bypass the (still very reasonably priced) Penley Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. By the same token, it doesnt bother me that some people like watching films like Courageous. And if that spurs them on to be better parents then all the better. But if they choose it instead of a film like Rabbit Hole they do so at their own loss.

I was concerned that the film would explore their grief in gory, emotional detail. Though there were, indeed, many scenes depicting their angst and grief, it was a much more well-rounded treatment of the subject than I had expected. The couple is ready to move on to the next chapter of their lives after 8 months of grieving, but they just don't know how. They discuss cleaning out their son's room, selling the house, giving away his possessions, having another baby - but they're not quite in sync as to when and how to actually move on.

They are part of a support group, but both conclude separately that the group can no longer help them. Some of the other members of the support group have been attending for many years, and Becca and Howie have no desire to let it take over their lives. They struggle with how to act with their friends and family, and how to fill their now empty lives.

4308184,5,B004AE3QY4,"Rabbit Hole is one of the best films I have seen.  It depicts  a suburban couple who have lost their four-year-old son.  He was hit by a car as he ran after his dog.  It has been eight months and the wife and husband are finding themselves in conflict about how to work through their grief.  Her mother and sister, their friends, the young man who was driving the car, and people in the therapy group they attend also struggle with the complications of the death of a child.  I like the simple honesty of the scenes, which show how loss does not necessarily draw people together, but does raise the stress in their lives.  Such an event demands change and it is never certain what direction that change will take.  Little decisions and acts determine if and how healing will take place.  I can't say more without ruining your experience of the film.  Fine script, fine direction, fine acting by  Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, and Dianne Wiest.",1348444800,,943,4.553571428571429

If you know someone who has experienced a loss of their only child and want to understand a little better what they might be going through, then this movie might be helpful.

This is an extremely somber, realistic, and heartbreaking movie. The characters are desperately hurting but carry on with stoic faces and muted voices. ""I don't know,"" is the most-spoken line and it reflects Becca and Howie's mind-numbing confusion and helplessness. The story observes that are no rules to grief and recovery, no magic words to heal the unhealable.

The best performances are given by newcomer Miles Teller as the teen who accidentally killed the little boy and the always-memorable Dianne Wiest as Becca's mother. They are both utterly believable and never look like they're 'acting.' Kidman and Eckhart are also good.

Howie (the stunningly handsome Aaron Eckhart) is dealing with his grief by attending Group Therapy while Becca (Nicole Kidman) deals with it by cooking and gardening. Complicating matters are Becca's pregnant sister, chatty mother (Diane Weist - excellent as always), and a fellow group member with a crush on Howie (Sandra Oh in a wonderful, sympathetic role). ""Rabbit Hole"" turns creepy when Becca seeks out the teen who was involved in her son's accident and they begin an odd, uncomfortable friendship. The story is what it is but the performances are mixed. Eckhart is outstanding - the grief comes through his handsome face effortlessly and Weist and Oh are great in their supporting roles, but Kidman is less successful. Careful not to channel Mary Tyler Moore in ""Ordinary People"" or Sissy Spacek from ""In the Bedroom,"" Kidman instead plays Becca like Bree from ""Desperate Housewives"" without a speck of vunerability that Marcia Cross brings to that role.

It is important that we don't see the accident or even the young son.  The film picks up 8 months later as Becca and Howie Corbett try to put their marriage back together.  They have no other children.  What we see is a beautifully scripted, brilliantly acted drama about grief and putting life back in order.  Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman are both terrific as the parents and there are wonderful supporting performances by Diane Wiest as Becca's mom, Sandra Oh and others.  I was especially touched by Miles Teller as the teenager whose car hit the youngster.  His confession/apology to Becca as they secretly meet would bring a tear to Darth Vader's eye.

The movie of course focuses on a couple grieving the loss of their child.
This is already a difficult story to develop into a 2 hour movie.

In the film, the story does not really move past being a collection of ""different scenes of grieving in different ways"".

It is sort of stagnant in that regard.

In fact, both my wife and I remarked to each other that considering the sad nature of the story, neither of us felt the least bit of emotional involvement in the film.
It did not touch us, or stir even the beginnings of a tear of wave of sadness.

4308203,4,B004AE3QY4,"Bottom-Line:  ""Rabbit Hole"" is a smartly written, superbly acted and well worth the discovery.  Now this is Oscar material!

Life has few rules it is honored bound to adhere to.  I have heard it said over and over again we--parents--should not survive our children.  Why?  Where is it written? Who said?  Who, or what degreed it so; certainly not life?  But when it happens, when our children die before us, how then do we--the parents, the adults--deal with the empty hole, the grief, the sorrow, the guilt left in deaths' wake?

Such question s and many more are posed, but never fully answered in ""Rabbit Hole"" (2010) staring Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge, The Hours, Eyes Wide Shut) and Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Battle: Los Angeles, Towelhead) as Becca and Howie the grieving parent of a four-year-old boy killed after his dog runs into street and struck by a car driven by Jason (Miles Teller).

The Story

Directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Shortbus, Girl 6), Rabbit Hole, which is based on a play by David Lindsay-Abaire, opens on the couple eight months after the death of their child.  They are not coping well; each is trying to figure out how to cope with the loss.  They have joined a support group and befriend Gaby (Sandra Oh ~ Grey's Anatomy, Sideways, Hard Candy) and Rick (Jon Tenney ~ The Closer, Beverly Hills Cop II).  But Becca soon tires of the group and stops going, and Rick leaves Gaby, leaving Howie and Gaby to form a closer relationship.

Meanwhile Becca's sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard ~ The Good Shepherd, Bella) turns up pregnant by her musician boyfriend Auggie (Giacarlo Esposito ~ The Usual Suspects, Smoke, Do The Right Thing).  And Gaby and her mother Nat (Dianne Wiest ~ I Am Sam, Edward Scissorhands, The Lost Boys) are continually at odds...

My Thoughts

There is a telling scene in ""Rabbit Hole,"" wherein the couple is at a grief support group and another member quips that the reason her children was taken is so that God could create another Angel.  Kidman's character's Becca take exception to that and asks why God would need to take her son in order to make an Angel; isn't he God after all, and couldn't he create all of the Angel's he needed without taking her son and causing her co much grief?

The scene is central and that is point out there is no playbook when It comes to handling grief, there is not playbook, we all handle it in our own way, some successfully, some not so successfully.

Rabbit Hole, which is vivid, emotionally powerful, but ultimately hopeful--at least I found it hopeful--may prove too depressing for some, while other may find it cathartic.  Both Kidman and Eckhart do a masterful job of relating the pain and sort of life-in-limbo spell a premature death can give birth to.  Both characters gingerly and painfully step towards some sense of normalcy throughout the film.

Becca seeks to come to grips with her loss by connecting with the teenager whose hit her son with his car, befriending him as a way to make sense of it all, while Howie is deeply angry but has not viable place to direct it.  Although they share the same sphere of sorrow, they are disconnected from each other, intimacy is missing as is love-making, but they still love one another enough to stay together and try to put their lives back together again.

Rabbit Hole does not attempt to cover ground already well-trod; instead we are given a glimpse of two lives ripped apart by grief, rage and unimagined sorrow, but instead of trying to fix what is wrong with the couple, we are taken inside their lives as they struggle to move past their loss onto the next part of their lives.  Neither quite knows how to get there and Rabbit Hole does attempt to tell us how, because there is no magic formula, no shinny pill, no life plan that will fix it.

Regrettably Rabbit Hole has an all too short run at the box office; too bad, because this is the sort of adult film that is sorely missing from the American cinematic landscape.

The actors portrayal was spot on, Becca's character being very much like mine and Howie's very much like my husband's.

The Film 4.5/5

Here's a film which made just $2.2 million at the box office, but Nicole Kidman received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Are you one of the few who bothered to go and see it? If not, is it worth checking out on Blu-ray?

The subject matter is the likely reason for the film being largely ignored. The title doesn't give away much either. This is not another live action version of Alice in Wonderland. Rabbit Hole is about one of the worst things that could happen to parents; it deals with the loss of a child. That doesn't sound like a fun watch, does it?

The film completely surprised me and I thought it was superbly done.

We aren't told at the outset that Becca (Kidman) and Howie (Eckhart) have suffered a loss. The writing respects the audience and lets us observe their actions. Becca turns down a dinner invitation from a neighbor and doesn't seem too happy when she discovers her sister is pregnant. Howie views a video of a child on his phone and we soon find out that their 4-year-old boy died eight months previously.

Becca is reminded of her loss everywhere she looks. Some of Danny's pictures are still on the fridge; his room looks like it hasn't been touched and she can see his fingerprints around the house. His clothes are still in the wardrobe so she decides to give them away. After removing the pictures, she informs Howie that she thinks they should sell the house as it's another constant reminder.

We learn that Danny was run over by a car when chasing his dog into the street. The unfortunate dog is sent to live with Becca's mother (Wiest).

Becca rejects all of Howie's romantic advances because she presumably fears that it could result in another child that she might also lose. When she sits in the park or goes to the store, there are happy children everywhere. Imagine having to deal with that. She virtually shuts down her life so that she doesn't have to face any situations in which she'll be reminded of her dead son.

The couple regularly visits a support group made up of other parents who are dealing with a similar loss. Becca can't stand facing that and soon decides to quit. She follows a school bus one day and almost crashes while trying to keep up with it. She watches a boy get off the bus and go into his house. Who is he and why was she so intent on seeing him, but not talking to him? He has an important part to play in the story and is responsible for the film's title, but I won't reveal why here.

Despite the sad subject matter, there are plenty of moments of light relief. One involves Howie visiting the support group while he's high and one of the group starts to talk about rage. I guess some things can seem hilarious when you're in that state.

The story is about whether Becca and Howie will find a way to deal with their grief and move on with their lives. It seems as if they are always arguing about seemingly insignificant things as they take out their anger on one another. Each has ways of temporarily escaping the situation and it's not clear whether their relationship will survive. That question is eventually answered and the whole story tackles the subject of losing one's child in a delicate and authentic way.

I haven't seen all of Kidman's roles, but it's hard to imagine her better than she is here. Eckhart also does a good job and Wiest is outstanding as Becca's mother. We get to see the characters and their relationships develop and change by the end of the film and the resolution is somehow uplifting. It's a shame that so few people saw it in the theater.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Due to the low budget, director John Cameron Mitchell shot Rabbit Hole digitally, but the end result looks fantastic. Detail is strong throughout and the digital image looks bright and clear. There are a few soft scenes, but there's very little to complain about. I felt very involved with the events on the screen at all times.

Audio Quality 5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track isn't something you would choose to show off your home theater system, but it's flawless. This is a quiet film driven by dialogue. The characters reflect on their lives and there are no loud explosions or gunshots. Ambient sounds are evident during scenes in the city and in the park and there are no problems of any kind. Dialogue was crisp and clear throughout.

Special Features 2.5/5

Anyone wanting to know more about the film will have to listen to the commentary track. There's really not much more to indulge in if you're a fan.

Trailer

Rabbit Hole was a complete surprise to me. I expected it to be almost too sad to watch, but it's actually a well-balanced film. The story seemed very truthful, the performances are strong and the Blu-ray presentation is excellent. If you like character-driven drama that's heavy on dialogue, it's definitely worth checking out. Although I haven't revealed how things turn out, I had a sense of optimism when the credits started to roll. Don't be put off by the strong subject matter.

4308209,4,B004AE3QY4,"This type of drama is not new. It involves a family trying to deal with the loss of a loved one. In this case it's the loss of a couple's only son (a 4 year old hit by a car). To make it stand above the fray you need good writing, acting and a unique approach. This movie has all three.

Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play the grieving parents. Both, for the most part, do a fine job. I'm glad Nicole is finding life after Tom Cruise. She IS good and she shows it here. Eckhart is always good and, with the exception of one scene, doesn't disappoint here. The writing is generally good. I liked the way the story unfolded. They didn't heap things on you all at once. The viewer is gradually introduced to the various facets of the story. Kidman is generally set up as the bad guy. She's the more unyielding of the two when it comes to 'moving on.' Aaron is trying but is discovered to be just as unyielding when it comes to one important aspect of the situation.

The directing, set design and all the things that make a good movie good are all at a professional level here. As good as the writing is, it does take some bad turns in the third act. There are some clunky scenes and one in particular where Eckhart overacts considerably. In another Dianne Wiest spouts wisdom beyond her character. But overall this is a good movie. There were some good insights and they didn't try to tie things up at the end. Life is messy and things don't always work out. There isn't always an end in sight and I'm glad these film makers figured that out.",1308009600,2,1542,4.2593856655290105
4308210,4,B004AE3QY4,"Many years ago, I saw ""Rabbit Hole"" play in Chicago theatre (I now forget if it was Goodman or Steppenwolf).  In any case it was a powerful play that left significant impression on me.  I was skeptical how such complex exploration of parental grief can have the same impact on the audiences when presented as a film.  However, the cast in this movie is wonderfully selected and they manage to bring internal and external conflicts that characters experience into a memorable and heart wrenching movie.

Recently, I have been interested in exploring grief as emotion, because I firmly believe that unless experienced on a deep, personal level, it is sort of emotion that is not possible to describe.  It is also a stigma to talk about it and sharing it with others brings a little or no consolation.  At one point is this movie, I truly enjoyed it when actress Diane Wiest explains it that grief is like a brick.  ""You carry it in a pocket and you know it is there because it weights so much.  And it never relly goes away, it only changes it forms"".

For every person, experience and dealings with grief are different although equally powerful.  This is one of those quiet movies that carry its power through audiences.  It moves silently and painfully and explores the deepest emotions we harbor inside.",1306454400,,1304,4.700440528634362

4308212,5,B004AE3QY4,"Kidman and Eckhart lost their son Danny 8 months ago as he ran into the street and got hit by a car. At first glance it appears the atheist Kidman is having more trouble coping with the loss as each parent copes with the loss in their own way, but they are on different time schedules. Early in the film Kidman's sister calls her in the middle of the night to pick her up at the police station. She was in a bar room fight with another girl. As it turns out, she is pregnant by a musician and the girl she fought with was his ex-gf, which he was still living with. At times the movie is a dark comedy.

At some point it becomes time to pack the memories away and get on with your life. Kidman reaches that point before Eckhart. She leaves group therapy and does her own therapy by talking to the teenage boy who accidentally killed her son. As it turns out it is good therapy for him, as he too must learn to cope with grief. Another awkward aspect of the grief situation is how relatives and neighbors respond to the grievers. As the movie points out there are no good ways, or at least it is a fine line few people can walk as some people try too hard to be there while others don't try enough.

In the movie ""The Rabbit Hole"" is the title of a comic book the teenage boy is creating. It becomes a metaphor for coping with grief as people create substitutes for their lost loved one, by visiting alternate realities in parallel universes, but they can never really go back because their love one is dead.

In addition to the comic book, Kidman gets advice from her mother. She tells her that you never get over the loss, but your feelings do change. It is like carrying a brick around in your pocket. You carry it around for so long, sometimes you forget it is there. Then you reach into your pocket for something, and suddenly there it is.",1306108800,6,1842,4.212464589235127
4308213,5,B004AE3QY4,"I followed the release of this movie with interest, though I couldn't bear to go see it at the theatre. I read the critical reviews, and they were mixed, though I knew, good or bad, I would eventually see the film for myself. I am a grieving father. I lost my 18 year old daughter to a drunk driver in February of 2008. I watched the movie on dvd one weekend when my wife was out of town.

  I find the reviews of this film predictable. There are those who recognize the authenticity of it and those who don't, just as there are those who understand grief and those who don't, simply because they haven't experienced it for themselves. As one who has experienced it - grief - I can only say that the portrayal of the characters in this film is remarkably accurate. Some reviewers judge the responses of the characters, others criticize the film for being too ""sentimental"". How can anyone be too sentimental about the death of a child? When you have walked this road, you will be surprised. You will not understand the reactions of your closest friends, or even your own. As with Becca and her mother, my mother and I both lost 18 rear old daughters. I didn't really understand my Mother's grief until I lost my own daughter. Recently we met to record my sister's story for StoryCorps, and on the way to the interview, we talked about how we both have come to the realization that we must give ourselves permission to do whatever we need to do in order to survive - even if those closest to us do not understand, even if we can't understand or articulate our motivations ourselves.

  Some people do get stuck in grief. Some try to numb their pain with drugs or alcohol or sexual indulgence. Some withdraw and isolate themselves. Some look to find help in the company of those who have walked the road before them. Some surround themselves with mementos of their lost loved one's life, and some need to rid themselves of the unbearable reminders of what they have lost. Some couples are driven apart. Some become closer. Some embrace the comfort to be found in religious faith, others blame God. There is no way to predict how this experience will affect and reorder one's life and relationships. It is an emotional tsunami. And it is totally inappropriate and cruel to demand that anyone conform to anyone else's expectation or timeline.

  I know that this isn't a very articulate review of the film. As a grieving father, I simply want to affirm that David Lindsay-Abaire's portrayal of how the death of a child can affect the lives of his or her parents is authentic and faithful to the real experience. It doesn't exhaust the gamut of possible reactions, but it does touch on the big issues and difficulties that grieving parents deal with. I don't think he is saying this is how it should be, but, rather, that this is just how it is. The film is not miserable and hopeless. But it honest enough not to offer cheap and unrealistic prescriptions. It forces us to wonder at the resilience of the human spirit and the power of love to persist in the face of seemingly overwhelming devastation. Don't judge the characters. Watch and learn. Have a heart.",1305936000,49,3155,4.560070671378092

Now, I've got a teenager myself but this got me really thinking of the blessing it is to have a son who is alive and relatively healthy.  So this did have a very strong emotional impact for me.

The acting by Nichole Kidman and Aaron Eckert were fantastic as you could, throughout the movie, see the weight of their son's death carried by them.  Masterful!

4308218,5,B004AE3QY4,"Talk about a film that guts me (emotionally) like a fish; `Rabbit Hole' is a brutally honest look at loss and grief and the constant struggle to find a sense of normalcy once life isn't normal anymore.  Watching the film once is surely enough (very few films are this depressing), but watching it once is a definite must.  There are few films that really understand such a complex subject as well as `Rabbit Hole'.  While I've never lost a child, I have two of them and so I understand deeply a parents love for that small being you want so much to protect from everything and everyone.

But you can't always do that.

`Rabbit Hole' picks up eight months after the death of four-year-old Danny.  His parents, Becca and Howie, are struggling to pick up the broken pieces of their lives.  Becca became reclusive and self-absorbed, cutting off everyone around her in an attempt to internalize her pain.  Howie tries to carry on with his life, acting as if nothing is bothering him and yet he sections himself off late at night and watches the same video on his phone over and over.  Becca tries to rid herself of her son's memory; from his clothes to his toys to the fingerprint smudges on the door hinges.  Howie wants to strengthen that memory; going as far as to keep his son's car-seat in his car as a way of holding onto what he's lost.  Becca resents the advice and comforts from others, especially her mother, because comforts and advice cannot replace the hole in her heart.  Howie thrives off other's experiences, finding a doorway to `answers' that help make his grief more tolerable.

In other words; Becca and Howie are grieving in drastically different ways.

`Rabbit Hole' gives us a snapshot of the lives of Becca and Howie and uncovers how they cope and eventually come to terms and move on, while learning once again how to rely on one another.  When tragedy strikes it is easy to take things out on those closest to you, and when you are both hurting so severely it becomes a bigger struggle because we expect so much out of the other person.  Howie knows that he has to be this rock of encouragement and yet who is he supposed to cry on?  The same can be said for Becca, who feels as though she has had her world ripped out from under her and yet she still has to contend with the needs of her husband, not to mention her mother and newly pregnant sister.  Life goes on, even when we want it to stop, and that is a hard lesson to learn.

Nicole Kidman is sensational here.  She layers Becca effortlessly, truly sinking herself into this character.  This is such a complex character because you need to be able to convey more than pain and suffering in order to make the character feel real and invested and relatable and she sells every moment, lacing her pain with a sense of wanting; and the scenes with Miles Teller are truly remarkable.  Speaking of Miles Teller, he is just beautifully sincere here.  Those tears running down his cheek kill me.  Aaron Eckhart takes a backseat to Nicole Kidman, but he doesn't phone anything in or rely on her to carry to film.  He doesn't have the showiest performance in the film, but he knows how to elicit genuine emotions that complement the approach Nicole was taking.  Dianne Wiest is always a welcomed force, and she proves once again that she is far more than just a sublime comedic actress; she is also a sublime dramatic one.

Aside from the acting, this film soars on a technical level as well; boasting a beautifully controlled score and some richly intriguing framing choices that elevated the film and gave it such an otherworldly feel, capturing the emotional purgatory of the key characters.

`Rabbit Hole' is unapologetically depressing.  Thank god for that pot smoking scene, which helped cut the film's thickly layered grief with a short-lived yet much needed comedic moment.  That said; there really is no other way to tell this kind of story, so bravo on all involved for `going there'.  The film ends with a glimmer of hope, proof that you can get back on track no matter how difficult it is to do so.

Without doubt, one of the best films of 2010!",1304985600,10,4125,4.547425474254743
4308219,3,B004AE3QY4,"*Spoiler Alert*

This is the story (for those who don't already know) of a married couple, Howie and Becca, living in a New York suburb about eight months after their four year old son, Danny, chased his dog into the street and was killed by a passing car driven by a teenage boy, Jason.

Suffering the loss of a child is something that most people don't go through. For those reading this gearing an angry response, I know that it does happen to some, and my heart goes out to them. My point is that a lot of people might not understand this movie (possibly not even myself, not having children at all) or the reactions of Howie and Becca, which I will elaborate on in a sec.

Nicole Kidman's character, Becca, is trying desperately to move on and simultaneously keep it all together. At one point, she tries to give her son's old clothing to her newly pregnant sister. Her sister rejects that offer, saying that it would be ""too weird"" to see her baby running around in Danny's clothes. Becca is completely crushed but somehow holds it all together long enough to take all of her son's clothing to a Goodwill drop box. And that example really describes the whole movie, a lot of scenes of reserved emotion, punctuated by huge explosions of emotion which seem insurmountable for this couple. I'm really sad that Nicole Kidman is getting all of the credit for this movie, because Aaron Eckhart really earns his stripes as Howie, Becca's husband who also quietly grieves and struggles to do the right things to keep his marriage together.

So, all that being said, with my previous point in mind, I have to say that through the entire movie, I was completely repulsed by Becca. Her behavior was really disgusting, especially towards her husband. She obviously feels a lot of anger towards herself AND Howie for the accident (they both blame themselves for leaving the gate to their yard open, although Becca does truly believe that it is no one's fault - more on this later). Howie consoles himself by watching and old iPhone video of Danny and going to a support group, which he tries to get Becca to join. Becca deals by basically purging the house of all memory of their son - pictures he made from the fridge, throwing out all of his old clothes. I don't necessarily think that her actions are all bad - she is trying to move on, after all - but she does all of these things without dealing emotionally, so she's really just a huge basket case. She eventually does go to group therapy with Howie one night, only to cruelly interrupt another couple who is trying to cope with the loss of their own child (the scene from the trailer, which looks funny, is actually very cold as the other parents are crushed by her words).

The other salient point is the relationship that Becca builds with Jason, the teenage driver of the car that killed her son. She accidentally sees him on a bus and ends up following him home, eventually running into him at a library and starting a strange (completely platonic) relationship with him - she forgives him for the accident completely, but also sees him (I think) as a projection of her son, had he lived. She (of course) doesn't tell her husband about any of this, so when Jason comes to the house to show Becca a comic book he drew, Howie freaks out, obviously not having accepted Jason's actions as accidental (even though they were). Becca responds by calling Howie an (rhymes with basshole) and storming out. Again, I can't relate to Becca at all on this. She doesn't tell her husband about seeing Jason, so when the kid unexpectedly shows up at their house and he has a negative reaction, HER negative reaction seems so overblown, especially since he is so patient with her throughout the whole movie. Towards the end, Becca further traumatizes this poor kid by showing up outside his house and completely breaking down in her car while watching him leave for prom. Of course, Jason sees her, and his confusion and anguish is apparent, but he can't do anything for Becca as he is in a car full of his friends already driving away. I understand that I'm supposed to be moved by Becca's catharsis, but I can't stop thinking of the horror on Jason's face when he sees her.

So really, the review is that the acting is a amazing (look out for the newcomer who played Jason, and Dianne Wiest is amazing as always), but I found Becca's character so difficult to relate to that it ruined a lot of the movie for me. I would say that it's... worth seeing if you think you can put aside a difficult character to see the other stars shine.",1304985600,3,4571,4.534545454545454

Some would want to carry, and they should, that memory and loss for whatever time that it takes to heal. The best cure (unfortunately, not explored by the movie) is to eventually turn those losses into a positive by enhancing the lives of others.

I would agree with the controversial idea presented in the movie questioning how a God could allow the youngest and most innocent life to end, and in many instances, quite uncomfortably violent ways. I also agree that the response, ""because more angels are needed"" is a pacifier in disguise for those still living.",1304467200,5,764,4.617647058823529

But the depth of feelings, of irrevocable loss, and the need to carry on, carry this on totally.  Miraculously, the writers and/or director didn't take the easy way out, that of rage.  Spouses don't abandon each other in their grief, nor do they encourage each other's sadness, although they acknowledge it.  Brilliantly acted, wonderfully written, this is what drama is supposed to be: about the vicissitudes of life,  (If you're looking for an action movie or one loaded with angst, this is not for you.) If you're looking for an excellent drama, this is. And it's not just a chick flick.

Not a weak link in the supporting cast, and Diane Wiest plays it straight, very effective. Grief is something that everyone deals with in a very individual way. (I remember Naomi Watts' brilliant performance in ""21 Grams""). Stylish, centered, and focused, I was amazed at how compelling the entire film really is.

Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart are fabulous as the grieving parents.

The film never, once, falls into genre convention, melodrama or cliche. Everything feels real. Becca and Howie feel like real people. This is in large part to the excellent writing and direction, and especially from the emotionally daring and available performances from Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Even side characters feel exactly right (Dianne Wiest, Sandra Oh, Tammy Blanchard, Miles Teller are all excellent). For as straightforward as ""Rabbit Hole"" is, it always seems risky. Maybe it's because the filmmakers let the story speak for itself. They let the characters breathe and you are gently shown their deepest, darkest feelings, letting you embrace them without judgment. ""Rabbit Hole"" really is something rare and special.

4308227,5,B004AE3QY4,"I don't understand why the Academy passed by this movie. It is extremely well-acted, directed, and tells a story that needs to be told. I was expecting an all-out tearjerker, but what I found was a well-rounded, necessary story that just takes you to the edge of despair without sending you over.

The plot, of course, concerns a couple, Becca and Howie, dealing with the loss of their perfect, innocent four-year-old son. It explores the anguish, grief, and blame that the main characters and several peripheral characters deal with when confronted with the loss of a child. The most interesting point of view, in my opinion, is that of the teenager who accidentally killed the boy. His interaction with Becca is deeply affecting. He is of course dealing with his own feelings of self-blame, but at the same time, in some way offers Becca consolation. He is both the cause of her current torturous state, but, ironically, also the source of her inner comfort.

Other interesting parallels are drawn between Becca and her own mother, who lost an adult child years past but in a less innocent way, and the parallel between Becca and her sister, Izzy, who lives what may be deemed an iresponsible lifestyle and who ironically becomes pregnant. Izzy's pregnancy and impending parenthood cause an eruption of feelings in Becca.

4308230,4,B004AE3QY4,"Nicole Kidman sure doesn't take the easy roles.  I'm sure it couldn't have even gotten made without her producing it as most viewers will have to motivate themselves to watch something this sad. The story involves a mother and father, Kidman and Eckart, who lost their four year old son eight months ago in a freak auto accident.  This is their trying to make some kind of life eight months after the fact.

There is a very able supporting cast at work too, with Miles Teller as the teen driver of the car which killed their son.  He did nothing wrong.  He was doing the speed limit and the boy ran out into the street after his dog who was chasing a squirrel.  Dianne Wiest plays Kidman's mother who has never wholly recovered from the death of Kidman's brother (to heroin overdose).

There are some really poignant scenes, such as when they are selling the house and the buyers ask about the son's room since everything in the room is as it was.  The buyers become like deer caught in the headlights as Eckart explains his son's death--you can just see their interest in the house end at that moment. Then Kidman starts meeting with the young boy driver.  They take some kind of strange comfort out of being with one another.  Then there is Kidman's sister, pregnant herself, which makes everyone in the family tense. This sister finds herself caught in one horrendous scene after another in what is supposed to be a relatively happy time for her.

Probably the most awful experience though is trying to sit through group therapy with others who have lost their kids.  I can see why one might think this would be helpful.  I did until I watched them in it and then, like Kidman, I wanted to leave.

So although I cannot call this ""enjoyable"" (there is way too much pain in this work), the acting is so excellent that it makes it worth watching.

Keep an eye on Miles Teller.  I think we will be seeing him in a lot.  He shows a lot of promise here.

In 2011, it is hard to believe that Nicole Kidman was forced to be in Tom Cruise's shadow for ten years of her acting career.  She is so talented that it is a shame she had to spend time in anyone's shadow.  Fortunately, she seems to be making her own creative decisions and living in no one's shadow even though she is remarried today.

4308231,5,B004AE3QY4,"RABBIT HOLE  is a brilliant Pulitzer Prize wining play that has been transformed for the screen by the playwright David Lindsay-Abaire: the power of the story remains wholly intact.  John Cameron Mitchell directs a cast that could not be better.  This is a stunning, quiet elegy about grief and its effects on those left behind.

Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are attempting to paste together their lives since the loss 8 months ago of their only child Danny in a freak automobile accident: Danny was chasing his dog into the street and was hit and killed by  teenage driver Jason (Miles Teller). Becca and Howie have become recluses, unable to rise out of their grief.  Becca's mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) attempts to comfort Becca: Nat lost her son (Becca's brother) at age 30 to a heroin overdose and Nat's attempts to compare the two losses irritates Becca.  Becca's young flighty sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) becomes pregnant by her best friend's husband Auggie (Giancarlo Esposito) and the newly pregnant couple moves in with Nat.  Izzy's pregnancy is difficult for Beeca to watch for all the memories it raises.  Becca and Howie join a group therapy for couples who have lost children and there they meet Gaby (Sandra Oh) and her husband; their marriage is falling apart even after 8 years following the loss of their child.  Becca cannot tolerate the religious aspects of the group and leaves the group (Howie stays), but she is driven to speak Jason, the high school senior who accidentally hit Danny causing his death.  Howie continues in group therapy, bonding with Gaby while Becca bonds with Jason, a bright sensitive lad who is desperately sorry about the accident and shares his graphic novel concerning Parallel Universes with Becca.  The story ends leaving  the audience to figure out just how things will resolve.

There is some very beautiful writing in this film.  A conversation between Becca and her mother about living with grief is a passage that should be available to anyone who has stumbled across loss of a loved one.  The conversations between Becca and Jason are luminous in their profound simplicity.  Each of the actors in the film give bravura performances - Kidman and Eckhart and Weist are particularly memorable  This is a fine film that has the courage to delve into a subject that is universal  yet too infrequently discussed.

4308233,5,B004AE3QY4,"""Rabbit Hole"" is an excellent film.  It covers the lives of Becca and Howie (Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart) and how they deal with the tragic loss of their four year old son who was killed in a tragic accident.  The little boy was chasing his dog into the street when he was struck down by car.  Every parent's nightmare.

The film is searingly emotional at times.  What film about such a topic could be otherwise?  The marriage of Becca and Howie is straining to its limits.  They simply cannot come to grips with a world without their son.  They briefly try group therapy but Becca is cynical and only becomes more so when people invoke God and his supposed plan.  Another couple explain their loss as ""God needed another angel.""  Becca snaps back: ""Then why wouldn't he have just made another angel? He's God, after all. Why not just make another angel?""  Becca leaves the group and doesn't return.

As the film progresses, it seems that couple are bound to separate.  Yet, somehow, they draw back from the precipice.  Perhaps they peer of the edge and don't like what they see?  In the end, they begin the road to a renewed existence.

From the outset, one must recognize that writing a film about a couples' grief after their four year old is hit by a car and killed, is quite difficult. This is what 'Rabbit Hole', originally a stage play by David Lindsay-Abaire, attempts to do. It's difficult precisely because there is no visible antagonist which an audience can identify with. Rather, the antagonist is abstract--you could even describe it as a 'force' which the grieving parents must fight against. A force, which threatens to consume the protagonists--not in their grief, but in an overwhelming anger toward one another.

Both Nicole Kidman's character 'Becca' and her husband 'Howie' (Aaron Eckhart) agree in theory that eight months after the accident, they both must 'move on'. But it's Becca who recognizes that Howie is still too angry about what happened and is unable to grieve. That's why she refuses to participate in support-group meetings, which she regards as a form of denial--the couples who participate in the groups, are merely going through the motions and are not in touch with their true feelings. Becca goes further and insists that she and Howie give up their dream house in the suburbs--that way Howie will not be able to obsess over their lost child if he's not in proximity to all those objects that remind him of their shattering loss. But Howie cannot give up those objects--at the film's midpoint, the relationship between the couple is severely tested after Becca accidentally erases a short video of their deceased son on Howie's cell phone. We can see that Howie's anger is driving Becca away from him and she resorts to doing things for herself that may bring an end to her inner turmoil (Becca, who truly wants to move on, finds Howie's anger is causing her to become angry too!).

So Becca decides to test herself by approaching the 'inmost cave' of her greatest fear. That would be of course having to meet up with Jason, the teenage boy, who was driving the car that killed their son. Becca tests herself to see whether she will be consumed by her own irrational anger (after all, the boy was not actually responsible at all for the accident). As it turns out, Becca bonds with the boy, and their relationship connotes that she has moved further along than Howie, on the complex spectrum of mourning and grief. Jason's imaginative Rabbit Hole comic book, a tale of a parallel universe where this tragedy hasn't happened, brings great comfort to Becca. In a powerful scene, she's also now able to weep, as she sits in her car and watches Jason drive off with friends (in slow motion), after his high school graduation.

Rabbit Hole's subplots, whether it be Becca's relationship with her mother (who also suffered a loss of a child), Becca's jealousy toward her sister now pregnant and Howie's flirtation with the now separated Gaby from the support group, only seem to be distractions in comparison with the principal dramatic moment of the film--the confrontation between Howie and Jason. How a grown man can yell at a practically defenseless teenager underscores the horrific effect the accident had on Howie's psyche. Fortunately, the blowup is cathartic, and although Howie is not willing to meet with Jason and apologize, he asks Becca to act as an intermediary--she will go to the boy and reassure him that Howie's crazy outburst was a temporary aberration and he really didn't mean what he said.

So 'Rabbit Hole' must be admired for keeping one's interest despite the lack of a tangible, visible antagonist. Nonetheless, I urge everyone to read A.O. Scott's excellent review of 'Rabbit Hole' in the New York Times who recognizes that Becca and Howie are not ""grounded in any recognizable social world"". Rabbit Hole is a story of obsession (in this case, a working out of grief). Since they are so obsessed (and we as the audience are made to focus so much on this obsession), we find out little about the details of the characters' lives outside this focused conflict. Hence the portraits of the principal characters should be viewed as somewhat limited.

Despite the characters' limitations, one cannot ignore the excellent performances of Ms. Kidman and Mr. Eckhardt. In the end, the performers leave us on a note of hope--the simple act of holding hands suggests that Howie is now ready to put his anger behind and move forward with Becca, toward a lasting recovery.",1297296000,23,4426,4.886817576564581

STARRING: Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Sandra Oh, Diane Wiest, Miles Teller, Tammy Blanchard and Giancarlo Esposito

WRITTEN BY: David Lindsay-Abaire; based on his play

DIRECTED BY: John Cameron Mitchell

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 17 December 2010

Rabbit Hole is a good movie but it's the kind of movie you need to be in the right mindset and mood to watch. What mood is appropriate, you ask? Well, depressed wouldn't hurt. While I wasn't depressed when I sat down to watch it and still enjoyed it, I'm a rare exception as I'm obsessed with cinema and see movies like this primarily for the acting, directing style, and cinematography. The average Joe, may find it emotionally exhausting. There's a reason this film was released in a limited circuit and right at Oscar Season.

The attention is on Nicole Kidman in her performance that's granted her with her third Academy Award nomination, and it's more than a worthy nomination indeed. If like me you're a fan of her work, you won't be disappointed.

There is very little commercial cinematic value to this film, and that is both what I loved about it, and what will cripple its chance for any wide acclaim from its viewers. It's about life, it's realistic, and it's a downer from start to finish. It's a story about loss and not how the characters circled in it overcome that loss, but how they adjust to it and somehow manage to move on with their lives.

Eight months ago Becca and Howie (Kidman and Aaron Eckhart), lost their 4-year-old son when he ran after the family dog in the street and was killed by a vehicle that swerved to miss the dog, not seeing the child until it was too late. Now Becca and Howie attend a couples group for grieving parents who have lost their children.

Well, they do until Becca has had enough of the religious views being offered up as explanations for the early deaths of the children. Finding more comfort in the group, Howie continues to go without her and soon engages in an inappropriate friendship with a single mother from the group (Sandra Oh). I won't tell you with whom or why, but Becca initiates her own little private meetings with someone she can talk to as well.

This is what I found most fascinating about this story; how we see these two characters deal with their grief in their own ways. Sex is no longer an option; Becca has made that perfectly clear. Howie doesn't blame the dog and wants him around but Becca does not. Howie holds resentment against the driver of the car and Becca does not. Howie holds onto sentimental things like videos of their son, and his fingerprints left around the house; Becca disregards these and wants to sell the house.

Despite their lack of a sex life, and the distance in their marriage overall, we believe that Becca and Howie will somehow get through this. They love each other, but they are both human beings, effected by deep emotions and it will be quite a while before they are at peace. Heavy as all that is, there is surprisingly a good bit of comedy we can all relate too as well; and don't worry it fits nicely amidst the flow of intense sequences.

Nicole Kidman is a seriously gifted actress and she plays Becca with such a unique grace. For most of the film she appears as though everything is fine. But every now and then things strike a chord in her that makes the pain explode out of her. Whether it be her mother (Diane Wiest) comparing the death of Becca's 4-year-old with an adult son of her own who died of a drug overdose; or a stranger in a supermarket who says something hurtful - Kidman displays her talents through Becca in the rawest of forms, and it's as good as magic.

And whilst on the subject of good acting, grab a pen and jot down this name: Miles Teller. He has a small part in the film as a teenager named Jason; but you won't forget him (plus the title centers on his character). He was miraculous and will no doubt go on to do big things in his career. Maybe he picked up a thing or two from Kidman.",1297123200,,4043,4.484353741496599

The end project was such a success, and even a few days after seeing it I find myself thinking about scenes and portions of the film that were just so well done.  This film wasn't given a wide release, most likely due to the dark subject matter of losing a young child.  Don't let that get in your way though, as the end result is a relatively inspirational film going experience.  See this movie.",1296950400,,526,4.391752577319588
4308237,5,B004AE3QY4,"John Cameron Mitchell makes a radical departure from his two previous films with the drama Rabbit Hole, based on the off-Broadway play by David Lindsay-Abaire who also wrote the screen adaptation. Nicole Kidman (also a co-producer) and Aaron Eckhart star as Becca and Howie, a married couple still coping with the death of their young son nearly a year earlier. This story is not new, but the way the material is handled makes it stand out.

The death of their four-year-old son Danny has put a strain on Becca and Howie's marriage, with both their sex life and social life suffering as a result. While Howie continues working, Becca stays at home surrounded by reminders of her son. After trying to cope with his death together by attending a support group, the two look for ways to come to grips with their situation separately. While Howie befriends a pot-smoking member of the support group named Gaby (Sandra Oh), Becca initiates contact with Jason (Miles Teller), the teenager who accidentally ran over her son. Dianne Wiest co-stars as Nat, Becca's mother alongside Tammy Blanchard as Izzy, Becca's newly pregnant sister.

The supporting cast adds a lot of depth to the film that has gone widely unmentioned. Sandra Oh brings humor, as well as dramatic poignancy to the film while Teller perfectly captures the sadness of his young, guilt-ridden character. The real stand-out among the supporting cast is Wiest, a two-time Oscar winning actress whom I haven't seen too often lately. Why isn't she in higher demand? She proved decades ago that she's a terrific actress and shows here that she hasn't lost any of her ability. While the rest of the cast (particularly the leads) crank up the emotional level to 11, Wiest opts for a much quieter, but no less moving performance.

Kidman and Eckhart deliver career-best performances and make this film the powerful drama that it is. Kidman (in an Oscar-nominated role) plays the contemptuously bitter Becca with great warmth and humor. She's a marvelous, underappreciated actress who taps into some dark corners of the heart here making her a very deserving recipient of her Oscar nod. While much praise has been given to Kidman, it is Eckhart who gives the most emotional, Oscar-worthy performance despite being overlooked by both critics and audiences. There's a lot of raw power in both performances and I cite two scenes to emphasize this; (1) when Becca slaps a woman in the supermarket and (2) a scene mid-way through the film where Becca and Howie get into an explosive argument. The emotion and sincerity that Eckhart projects in the latter scene is heartbreaking. Considering this scene and another in which Howie unexpectedly confronts with Jason, it is unfathomable how Eckhart didn't get nominated for his performance. It's a tragedy he hasn't at least gotten more recognition for his stunning work.

Writer Lindsay-Abaire handles this subject matter with great sensitivity while wisely avoiding sentimentality. The film's frank, direct dialogue and complicated emotional structure make Rabbit Hole a much more poignant, gripping film than the usual melodramatic fare that spawns from this type of story. Linday-Abaire doesn't avoid opportunities for humor while telling this story and it's used to great effect. The scene where Eckhart and Oh attend group stoned is hilarious within the context of the film.

Meanwhile, Mitchell demonstrates substantial range as a director. While his previous two films were preoccupied with the sexual element of relationships, here he displays a perceptive talent for capturing the emotional element as well. He does great justice to this material in the way he handles it too. An example of what I mean is that we never see or hear the son's death, only the expressions on the faces of Becca and Jason. It's a powerful scene that uses only the body language of the actors and the graceful cinematography to illustrate this pivotal event. By shooting the scene in this manner, rather than showing the boy's death, it is much more affective.

The film concludes nicely, neither ending with sappy optimism or bleak misery. It wraps up on a poignant, hopeful note but not a predictable one. I have seen this film twice and I believe it's one of the best films of 2010. It's an acting piece that gives under-appreciated actors to really showcase their talent, but it's backed by a deeply felt script and sensitive direction. While it lacks the gritty, emotional realism of a film like Blue Valentine it loses none of its original impact on a second viewing. With that said, despite a glimmer of hope for the characters, the film is a bit of a downer and I can't imagine watching it again. Don't let that dissuade you from seeing it though, as it's one of the most powerful and emotionally effective dramas I've seen recently.

4308238,3,B004AE3QY4,"One of the more serious dramatic movies I've seen from 2010 is Rabbit Hole (2010), starring Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Dianne Wiest, and Sandra Oh. It's had a very limited release in theaters, where I was lucky to see it, but you'll definitely want to check it out on Blu-ray or DVD when it comes out if you can't still find it in a theater near you. Like the tagline on it's poster, the only way out of the dark emotional content of Rabbit Hole is through watching it. Rabbit Hole is ultimately a movie about grieving: the process it takes to get through it, how it changes us (or doesn't change us), and what we ultimately come to terms with. If you're having second thoughts about watching this movie, I encourage you to put those thoughts aside and watch the film anyway. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did.

What makes this film very good (3.5 stars out of 5) is the incredible writing, acting, and visual storytelling led by director John Cameron Mitchell. While Mitchell seemed an unusual choice for directing this story, I was very impressed with how he handled it. I haven't seen his first two movies, Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001) and Shortbus (2006), which both have reputations for being VERY unique, controversial, and ""out there"" movies. Rabbit Hole is certainly not in those categories. It's a mainstream look at a story of two parents losing their young son to a tragic accidental death and how they deal with it.

I think what surprised me the most with Rabbit Hole was how easily I got into the story of married couple Becca and Howie, played perfectly by Kidman and Eckhart. Their on screen marriage is very believable and well written. It's interesting that Becca and Howie deal with grieving over their young son's death opposite to the stereotypical gender-specific way that we would expect. Becca deals with the death more like a guy would, and Howie more like a woman. I think this twist helped make the story more interesting since stories similar to this one have been told before on TV and in the movies. With our changing gender roles in our current 21st century culture, men and women don't fit all nice and tidy into the boxes they used to. And Rabbit Hole isn't afraid to look at that along with death at the same time.

I didn't really know much about the story going into see the film, and that was probably to my benefit as a viewer. It's not the story itself that makes Rabbit Hole better than most adult-oriented dramatic feature films, but all the elements that make up the movie. The cinematography is great from director of photography Frank G. DeMarco, along with excellent production design by Kalina Ivanov. Written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the script and the play on which this film is based, are realistic, current, and fresh in dialogue and emotional subtext. Director Mitchell brought what I assume is a bit of his taste to the film, but it didn't call attention to itself, which was good for this story.

With a glut of superhero/action movies, comic book tales, and animated feature films filling our theaters every week, it's nice to have something else to see in the theater. While Rabbit Hole is definitely an arthouse niche film that will only appeal to a select audience who appreciates subtle classic filmmaking, I for one am glad that I chose to see this film in the theater on the big screen. It was worth the price of admission and there was no upcharge for 3D glasses!",1295827200,3,3446,4.607491856677524
4308239,5,B004AE3QY4,"Upon watching and reviewing recent Oscar bait, I can firmly and honestly say that not a lot has captured my undivided attention. This isn't the case for John Cameron Mitchell's Rabbit Hole, however.

Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play Becca and Howie, a couple who lost their four year old son, who was killed in a car accident eight months prior to when the film takes place. Becca is an ex-executive who became a stay-at-home mom, and Howie still goes to work. They learn to grieve in different ways, including making small-talk with the driver of the car that killed their son, smoking weed before group grief meetings, engaging in questionable behaviour, and doing anything they can to move forward in their lives.

The one special thing about this film, is that it always knows what it is, and it saves itself from unbearable sentimentality, sap, and melodrama. However, thanks to its tough, yet sensitive script and direction, and impeccable performances, and much-needed moments of black comedy, it saves itself from drowning. You feel, as the viewer, as if you've known these characters for years. They give you a sense of familiarity that makes the experience better than it would be otherwise.

This film, is in no way speaking, a documentary, however, it is so real, honest, and emotionally gritty, to make even the most cynical viewer feel the emotions that the characters are going through. The direction, nailed by John Cameron Mitchell, is sensitive enough, however doesn't allow the picture to indulge in moments of extended melodrama.

Rabbit Hole is based on the play, of the same name, which won Tony Awards and the Pulitzer Prize, back in 2005, by David Lindsay-Abaire, and it would be surprising, to me, if this adaptation doesn't receive the same recognition. Lindsay-Abaire, having written the screenplay, gives the film viewer the feeling that they're watching the stage production. It has the same vague staginess that 2008's Doubt had, however, like Doubt, it manages to not become obnoxious, nor pretentious.

However, the real prize here, comes from the film's impeccable cast. Nicole Kidman does her best work in years. She gives a lived-in performance that makes you forget that she's Nicole Kidman. She's Becca. During a scene, where she breaks down in her car, you feel her pain, and you break down and sob with her. Kidman manages to remind the audience why she is thought of as a fabulous actress. She makes you believe that nobody else could have played this character. She is extraordinary.

Aaron Eckhart is also award-caliber in this film. He doesn't have as much screen time as Kidman, however, he provides the persona of the grieving, quiet, emotionally distraught husband, quietly drifting away from the life that he once had. Dianne Wiest is a shoo-in for best supporting actress this year, playing Becca's mother. She, and fellow cast member, Sandra Oh, bring comic relief when the film needs it the most, and, like the other cast members, you are lead to believe that no other actor could have played them.

In short, Rabbit Hole is surely one of the best films I've seen in 2010. Its depressing premise isn't all it sounds to be. It is a film that is filled with hope, black comedy, reality and perception. This is one you do not want to miss.",1295654400,,3290,4.885304659498208

This film presents the difficulty they have in other familial relationships due to their loss.

4308241,5,B004AE3QY4,"Rabbit Hole is not the sort of movie that people generally pick as something to watch as it deals, in fairly unflinching terms, with an issue most people hope they'll never face: what happens to people after the loss of a child. It is, I think, a good thing then that Rabbit Hole has some big-name actors - Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, Dianne Wiest - who may attract people's attention to the film, because it is very much worth seeing.

Becca (Kidman) and Howie (Eckhart) Corbett are a married couple in pain due to the loss of their only child, Danny, who died eight months ago when he ran out into the street and got hit by a car. They're attempting to cope but not doing very well at it, and in fact their attempts to cope are driving them apart. Becca's way of coping is in trying to escape from her grief and from the memories, avoiding anything that reminds her of Danny, while Howie clings to his grief and to everything that does remind him of Danny. And if these strains were not enough, there are the additional strains of dealing with family and friends. Becca's mother, Nat (Wiest), trying to be helpful by sharing her own experience of loss of a son ends up alienating Becca who deeply resents the comparison. Becca's sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard), who's rather immature and involved with a married man, reveals that she's pregnant, provoking more resentment from Becca. And Becca's best friend is avoiding her, simply because she has no idea what to say and Becca resents this and refuses to reach out.

Even when trying to work through their loss by attending a support group, Becca and Howie's difference still pull them apart. Becca can't stand the group and gets to the point where she lashes out at another couple's attempting to find solace in religion, while Howie feels that sharing the grief makes it better. A foreshadowing of the dangers of their differences is in another couple in the group, Kevin (Stephen Mailer) and Gabby (Sandra Oh), who've been coming to the group for eight years but who end up splitting up because Kevin wants to move on and Gaby, like Howie, can't let go.

One particularly interesting development in the film comes when Becca sees a high school student on a bus and ends up following the bus to see where he gets off. Why? Does he bear some resemblance to her son, does she see in him the young man he might have grown up to be? But as the film progresses, we learn that the student, Jason (Miles Teller) was the driver of the car that hit her son when he ran into the street. Becca ends up meeting with him and talking in the park, looking for what even she doesn't seem to know. But it ultimately leads her to a cathartic moment when she sees him going to his senior prom and breaks down in tears in her car, finally giving in to, and coming to terms with, her grief.

And Howie too comes to his cathartic moments, though more in stages. One blackly comic one is when he and Gaby (after her husband has left her) get stoned in her car before going in to the support group and end up giggling hysterically when another member of the group is trying to share. Another heart-breaking one comes when Becca and Howie put the house up for sale and Howie makes the ghastly mistake of trying to show a young couple the house, including his son's room, where he ends up having to tell them what happened to his son, immediately ruining any chance of their buying the house. But the final one comes where Howie is on the edge of beginning an affair with Gaby, but finds that, no matter what, he cannot bring himself to give up on Becca.

The performances by the actors are all excellent, but two in particular stand out.  Nicole Kidman and Dianne Wiest both richly deserve Oscar nominations for their performances, showing how hard it is to deal with that kind of loss while at the same time showing how it is possible (though the film never makes it easy or simplistic) to find a way, and that there is no one-way-fits-all solution; that each individual has to find what works for them and that you have to accept that others have to find their own way.  One of the best scenes, where Wiest truly shines, is where Becca and Nat finally make a connection on shared loss:

Becca: ""Does it ever go away? ""
Nat: ""No, I don't think it does. Not for me, it hasn't - has gone on for eleven years. But it changes though.""
Becca: ""How?""
Nat: ""I don't know... the weight of it, I guess. At some point, it becomes bearable. It turns into something that you can crawl out from under and... carry around like a brick in your pocket. And you... you even forget it, for a while. But then you reach in for whatever reason and - there it is. Oh right, that. Which could be awful - not all the time. It's kinda...""
[deep breath]
Nat: ""not that you'd like it exactly, but it's what you've got instead of your son. So, you carry it around. And uh... it doesn't go away. Which is...""
Becca: ""Which is what?""
Nat: ""Fine, actually.""

A hard film to watch at times, but very much a film worth seeing, both for the ways in which it deals with the stresses such a loss inflicts, and for the stand-out cast and fine performances.  Highly recommended.",1295222400,57,5171,4.4222689075630255

When you truly love someone you give to them whatever they need, what ever they long for, while having selflessness, unselfishness, self-sacrifice, and altruism.  This is how we all love our children!

Today I saw a trailer of a movie called ""Rabbit Hole!""
The film is starring Nicole Kidman, the mother, whose name is Becca and Aaron Eckhart whose name is Howie. It is about a Mom and Dad who lost their child, Danny.  The scene takes place at a grief support session in a dim lit area with folding chairs in a circle along with a group of grieving parents.  They kind of fidget and the room is silent.  One of the Fathers in this grief support group starts to speak of seeing his child in his dreams.  Another Father mentions that ""God took her.""  One of the mothers starts the conversation by saying, ""God needed another Angel!""  Nicole Kidman, Becca interrupts her at that point while her husband Aaron Eckhart, Howie turns his head to listen.  She replies back to the women, ""Why didn't God just make another Angel?""  ""Well, he is God After all, ""Why didn't he just make another Angel?"" ""Hmmm?""  Howie, the father,feels Becca is trying to ERASE their son.  I sincerely believe that my child will never just be erased.  I will not let that happen.  I think about my son constantly.  The pain is colder and darker than you can ever imagine!  I will never say good-bye to him.

I honestly truly do not understand why our children were the chosen ones and I never will!  I do not believe for one second that a loving God is pulling strings while picking and choosing who is going to be next!

You must remember, Nicole Kidman is an exceptional actress.  She has three beautiful children and is a millionaire along with Aaron Eckhart.  They have not truly experienced any of this torture that we go through day in and day out, but are only portraying a part in the movie as a mother and father who suffer with incomprehensible grief after losing their child.

I am just ordinary folk if you want to choose that word.  We live in the real world where we seek out each other to look for compassion and understanding.  The loss of my child will never fade and stay with me until the day I die:::::::::::::::::::::Tears!

4308243,5,B004AE3QY4,"""Rabbit Hole,"" based on the play with the same name by David Lindsay-Abaire and directed by John Mitchell Cameron, is an almost two hour insightful commentary on grief, more specifically the grief of two parents who have lost their four-year-old child because of an accident. He chased his dog into the street and ran in front of a car. The film opens eight months after the accident. Howie (Aaron Eckhart) and Becca (Nicole Kidman) are the parents consumed with their loss. They try practically everything-- going to a support group for parents who have lost children, getting rid of their son's clothes, letting a relative (at first) keep the dog, putting their house on the market for sale-- in an effort to get through what has to be the tragedy of all tragedies for parents, the loss of a child. Of course the question on every viewer's mind is whether Howie and Becca's marriage-- they obviously love each other very much-- will survive the horror they find themselves in.

The film progresses from one intense deeply moving scene to another, but two stood out for me: (1) Howie and Becca attend the support group and are listening to one grieving father explain that God took his child because he needed another angel. Becca responds that she doesn't understand. Since he is God, why couldn't he just make another angel without bothering with the man's child. (2) Becca asks her mother (Dianne Wiest) does one ever get over the death of a child. (Becca's brother, a drug addict, has died as a fairly young man and is the cause of much conflict between her mother and her when her mother compares the two deaths.) Her mother responds that one never gets over the death of a child, but that the pain becomes different and something one can bear.

Both Eckhart and Kidman give superlative performances as do the secondary characters as well. While the film is sad beyond measure, in a strange way it is comforting. Death and loss are universal, and most of us, if we live very long, will come eventually face to face with the loss of someone we love. You leave the theatre feeling that you have seen a movie that makes an honest statement about these sometimes awful, unspeakable situations we as humans find ourselves in.

Highly recommended.",1293840000,77,2247,4.7270408163265305
4308244,5,B004AE3QY4,"About two years ago, I sat in the first row of a hushed and silent theater watching a stage play titled RABBIT HOLE. This is a very sophisticated and powerful story. Sophisticated in that it doesn't ask you to merely cry for what is obvious tragedy - the accidental death of a 4 year old - It asks you to understand the now dreadful existence of that child's parents and to see through their eyes. It doesn't hide behind cheap emotion. The family's pain is there, in front of you for all to see and the mother and father are barely dealing with it. they don't run around in sackcloth and wailing and weeping. But they aren't living life. They are still in the depths of sorrow and mourning. They walk like real people. They joke like real people. But they aren't living. There isn't a stunning revelation that brings understanding and reconciliation for any of these folk. Nothing that brings sudden forgiveness and returns meaning to life. This is slow, earnest progress out of the depths and as honest a character study as you will ever see. One of the best drama I've ever seen on stage or screen. Well worth it.
I was happy to see this drama live onstage and I hope to see it in the theater or on disc.",1292630400,7,1206,4.388392857142857

8420074,5,B004AE3QY4,"Just to give you a warning- Rabbit Hole is *extremely* sad.  Those who've lost anyone in their family (doesn't necessarily have to be their son or daughter) is going to find a lot to relate to with tears to boot in a movie like this.

It's about a husband and wife (Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman) who lost their son 8 months prior in a freak accident when the kid ran into the streets chasing after their dog.  The two struggle to cope with the loss.  The movie does an incredible job portraying the realism of losing a child.  You can feel the bitterness and anger the parents are going through.  The teenager who was driving that day (Miles Teller) and kills the son plays a part in the movie as well.  More on his presence later.

At first the movie tricked me into thinking Nicole is getting her daughter out of jail (Tammy Blanchard's character) but we soon realize the two are sisters.  Actually it wasn't really obvious until they both referred to Diane West's character as mom.  Since the movie takes place after the death of Nicole and Aaron's son, you can probably guess Rabbit Hole is a drama and will remain that way the entire way through, and it does.  An extremely sad drama.  Nicole and Aaron go to a bereavement support group where other husbands/wives attend, but unfortunately for Nicole she doesn't like being there at all.  She doesn't like God being brought into conversations and leaves angry even though her emotional husband wants to stay.

There's a few notable lines and scenes that were *really* relatable for me.  My favorite is when Diane West explains that many years after you lose someone (in this case her 30-year old son to a drug overdose, which would be Nicole and Tammy's brother) the weight and sadness of the tragedy becomes less intense years later.  Diane's character even says ""It's like carrying around a brick in your pocket"".  This honestly describes the process of losing a loved one *very* well.  It's really sad for a while, but slowly as the years turn into decades, you're able to push it aside (at least a little bit) and move on.  I can relate to these words since they match the way I felt 10 years after losing my mom.

It seems unusual that for a while Nicole doesn't seem upset over losing her son and settles for anger or a quick desire to change the subject when confronted with the matter.  Meanwhile Aaron is the one who's more emotional.  The scene with the two of them getting into a fight in the bedroom and playing the blame game over who's at fault for their son's death illustrates the hidden anger the two of them kept to themselves.  It was only a matter of time until a fight like this would happen.  I won't spoil what happens, but Nicole does break down eventually in a way I didn't see coming.

Throughout the movie you can expect to see Nicole, her sister and the mom get into the occasional arguments, all because of the lingering anger that is still occurring over their losses.  It does seem unusual that neither Nicole or her sister bring up the brother very often.  The mom does though.  Not that the story is about him of course, but given the closeness of this family and the conversations they have (and the amazingly written story!) it seems a little odd that more wasn't mentioned about him.  The mom is about as nice as you can guess, so you really feel bad for her.

Anyway one day while waiting at a traffic light, Nicole turns and sees the boy responsible for killing their son (Miles Teller) riding in a school bus.  She follows the bus to the boy's house, but doesn't approach him right away.  She visits this bus stop a few more times over the next week (month?) until one day Miles walks up from behind, realizes who she is (I think!), reveals he skipped school that day which is why he wasn't on the bus, and the two walk to the park to have a conversation about the events the day her son was killed.  He admits he may have been going a few digits above the required speed that day.

All the while the husband knows nothing about the two meeting up, which comes into play later on.  I won't spoil what happens but I figured Aaron would be a LOT more upset than he was when Miles drops by unannounced to visit one day, and the husband's home as well.  Perhaps getting high with Sandra Oh in the parking lot of the bereavement group building while listening to 70's ballads and having Sandra lead him on is the reason Aaron wasn't upset about Miles and Nicole meeting up in secret, because he had secrets of his own.  That's not the only thing Aaron and Sandra do either.  They also humiliate themselves by attending the group high, and have the audacity to laugh while the other parents are discussing and mourning the loss of their children.  At least this ends with the two of them realizing they shouldn't be together since Aaron loves his wife.

The only big thing that seems odd to me is the comic book Miles shares with Nicole to help them both cope with the loss.  The writing was a little strange, though appropriate since Miles is technically a teenager so his means of coping with a loss would understandably venture down such territory.  I think the comic book is about meeting deceased loved ones in an alternate reality, but I had trouble grasping it.  On another note, Nicole mentions early on she wanted to move away even though her husband was initially against it.  You get the feeling had the husband agreed earlier on, a lot of the arguments the two had wouldn't have happened.

You know what scene was odd to me?  And I'm probably the only one who thinks it's weird.  When Aaron is attempting to bring in potential house buyers (a man and his wife) and he takes them on a tour through the house.  When in his son's bedroom he says something like ""I still see my son sometimes"" and the husband/wife give him a *super* confused look with their eyes wide open, almost like they thought Aaron meant he sees his son's ghost.  When the camera shows the husband and wife again they talk to Aaron normally as they leave the bedroom.  A weird moment!

This isn't a movie that will provide a happy ending either.  That would be impossible unless the story were to suddenly turn into fiction and the son appears before Nicole and Aaron like nothing ever happened.  That's the only way a happy ending can happen here.  So with that in mind, I was hoping for more out of the ending than what we got.  10 minutes before the ending when Nicole sits in her car, parks down the street from Miles house and watches him prepare to go to the prom... now *that's* quite the scene.

The acting is extremely solid and the characters are spot-on amazing.  The husband being emotional and wondering why Nicole's trying to erase their son's existence is really good writing (I noticed she was doing that too!) and he eventually confronts Nicole about it.  Also good writing is the sister who has a troublemaker history, a little bit of friction between her and Nicole and has to be bailed out of jail early on for a bar fight.  When Nicole intervenes and slaps a mother in a supermarket because the woman wouldn't let her son have a snack is maybe going a bit too far, but perhaps some mother's would be angry enough over the loss of their child that they'd lash out in such a way.  Tremendous highly recommended movie.",1495929600,,7308,4.470943396226415
