5058798,5,B00770XQEI,"Set in Stone is a must see for those who would rather think critically than be led by the high priests of philosophical naturalism who attempt to protect their dogma at all costs.  If science is all about the ""facts"" why the emotion, defensiveness, and desire (by some) that none should see this film?  Of what are they afraid?  What is wrong with alternative views of scientific data?  This DVD is meant to show that just because a certain story is told about the origin of a rock formation, doesn't mean there are no other interpretations that can tell a different (and maybe better) story.  Science is a human activity that attempts to understand the world around us.  All scientists have the same material to work with and many non-scientists don't realize that one's worldview affects how the material is interpreted.  For the student of science, critical thinking is an important component of their education and for critical thinking to be a reality, they must understand how unprovable assumptions  with respect to earth's geological history (whether they assume philosophical naturalism or biblical purpose and design) affect how data are interpreted.  Because no one was present to see these formations at their beginning, no geologist can proclaim exactly what happened.  Instead, they can infer a story based on both their scientific knowledge and their worldview. In Set in Stone, highly trained geologists; Snelling, Whitmore, and Garner offer an alternative explanation for some of the European rock formations and they do it against the backdrop of the beautiful English and Scottish countrysides. It is well worth watching and though your thinking may be challenged, these geologists invite you to weigh all the evidence so that you can draw your own conclusions.",1345334400,10,1780,5.1280276816609
5058799,5,B00770XQEI,"Very carefully and closely argued case for catastrophe showing that in example after example in the unique British geology, that catastrophe is the only satisfactory way to understand the rocks.",1343865600,15,194,5.5
5058800,1,B00770XQEI,"This DVD is highly misleading propaganda by a group of notorious young-earth creationists.  They don't admit it in the DVD, but they believe that all the catastrophes they describe in the DVD were a part of one huge catastrophe - Noah's flood about 4,500 years ago.

The DVD contains egregious errors of fact (the lower rocks at Siccar Point are NOT planed off flat), invents mysterious where there are none (the lack of bioturbation at Mam Tor is simply because the sediment was too soft for bottom-dwelling creatures), and repeats long discredited creationist arguments (C-14 in fossil fuels has been known for over a decade to be due to neutron capture reactions underground).

It is selective and misleading, and routinely omits contrary facts that disprove the presenters' account, like the Interbasaltic Bed at the Giant's Causeway, a fossil laterite that shows that eruptions there were not continuous but were interspersed with long time intervals.

For a thorough, detailed debunking see my review ""Deceit in Stone"" on Amazon.co.uk - search on ""Set in Stone DVD"" and you'll find it.  If you have the time, and stamina, look at the response by Paul Garner ""Still Set in Stone"" (link is on the first page of the comments thread following my review, and again on page 6 of the comments thread).  Then read my response to Garner (page 6 of the comments thread following my review) and you will see that Garner does not address my criticisms, but merely creates a smokescreen before running away.  And run away he did when he saw my response to his.

Basically, in ""Still Set in Stone"" Garner did not address my most serious criticisms.  He skirted around my technical points, ignored the really tough ones, and referred to literature that is often irrelevant, and sometimes did not even say what he claimed it said, whilst persevering with claims he knew to be false, and throwing in some gratuitous ad hominem attacks.  I drew Garner's attention to my response to this and waited.  He replied saying that he did not feel under any obligation to respond!  Since then he has not even acknowledged on his blog, or on the Truth in Science website, that I responded to ""Still Set in Stone"" so his audience may be left with the false impression that he has successfully responded to a critic when, in fact, all he did was put up a smokescreen before running away.

Despite all this I offered him an olive branch.  I said I would drop most of the (by now) lengthy discussion if he addressed my key points on just four of the diverse topics covered: namely those relating to the Giant's Causeway, C-14, Mam Tor and Siccar Point.  His response to this generous offer?  Silence.

As I have uncovered clear evidence of deliberately misleading claims and demonstrably false statements in the DVD, and in Garner's initial reply to me, and he has refused to address this evidence, he most certainly is obliged to respond.  That he now prefers to go into hiding is a damning indictment of his competence and integrity.  It is dishonest, cowardly and unprofessional.  That Truth in Science, knowing about these issues, is nevertheless pressing ahead with attempts to peddle Garner's rubbish to schoolchildren is despicable.  Shame on them.

Do not buy this DVD.  It is garbage.",1343779200,15,3267,4.836330935251799

All I will say is there is certainly evidence of some ""catastrophic"" events but it is a far cry to try to explain everything in that manner.  Goodbye creationists.

5058810,1,B00770XQEI,"Alright. Was looking for something to watch as I sat on my bike spinning for my daily workout and came across what I thought would be a science documentary. It's not. It's a cover creationism / ""Intelligent Design"". I watched about a little over half of it and was disappointed. Now, let me say that I'm not a geologist and I would love to see one critique this. That said, even I can see the flaws in some of their arguments.

For example, in their first example, they talk about how, if the rock lay was truly made up of old river beds, then all the rocks embedded within the layer should be touching. Fact of the matter is that they're assuming that those rocks were all static to start with. Also, were I live, Eastern US, I in fact do see rock all the time were the pebbles within are all touching. This isn't to say that local, catastrophic events don't happen in a short amount of time but the authors assume an ""all-or-nothing"" approach to the topic.

Anyhow, while watching this, I googled the names of three of the speakers presented here. While they do appear to have relevant credentials, they are all associated with or work for groups like Answers in Genesis, Discovery Institute or some other creationist organization. For those of you who don't know these groups, in order to work for them you have to typically sign statements declaring that any evidence that contradicts the bible must be assumed false and that the bible is 100% historically accurate literally in ALL cases.

It was the Discovery Institute that coined the term ""Intelligent Design"" when courts ruled creationism was religious teachings and, when taken to court, couldn't convince a Bush appointed, federal judge that ""Intelligent Design"" was a legitimate scientific theory. In fact, according to their star witness, his definition of ""scientific theory"", was so loose that astrology had to be considered a valid theory. (Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District) I mean, this video is  so bad it even pulls out the ""Were you there?"" argument.",1489622400,7,2028,4.769230769230769
5058811,5,B00770XQEI,"The definition of science from the Oxford Dictionary is, ""the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment"" No human being alive today has been alive long enough to observe and accurately document the claims made in this film of a cataclysmic event or by those who purport that the the earth is billions of years old.  Both sides make the same ""scientific"" observations, but come to different conclusions on how the ""matter being observed"" came into existence and arrived at its current location.  One side is called science and the other, myth or religion, neither is science by the current definition of science.  Both sides of the debate have brilliant scientists that believe they are correct and the other side is wrong.

This film purports a younger earth and a cataclysmic event, a flood, that drastically changed the ""look"" of the earth we see today.  They use numerous geological observations from around Great Britain.  This is not a film for entertainment, but was done to question the supposition of a really old earth.  It is professionally filmed and narrated and would be very useful in a Christian school, Sunday school class, or a Bible study.

When examined in the light of well-known and thoroughly researched scientific phenomena, creationist flood geology fails the most basic and simple test known to forensic science: bodies do not pile up the way creationists insist they must. The entire structure of Flood geology is nonscientific and is based directly on the creationists religious beliefs. Neither are their ideas and proposals new. All can be found described in 19th century literature. They were wrong then,and are still wrong now, because of the geological evidence. Creationist Christian Bible-believing geologists of that period tossed flood geology models overboard for the sound scientific reason that such models were discovered to be completely inconsistent with the physical evidence. They did this despite their religious beliefs, because the evidence was so compelling. There is currently no scientific reason to bring Flood geology back. It has had its day in court.

In this video they latch on to, and attack, the outdated concept of strict gradualism which has been a part of the idea of uniformitarianism. Gradualism is the concept that rock layers are laid down at a uniform rate over time.  The strict concept of gradualism is no longer widely held by geologists.  The agenda of this video is to provide a seemingly scientific and unbiased conclusion that rock layers have been laid down much more quickly than scientists currently believe.

Its not that difficult to imagine. Just as the Sun doesnt revolve around the Earth, the universe is not built on earth time. GOD time, not Earth time!

The time to travel from our solar system to the Alpha Centauri system could be measured in GOD seconds (or less) , but in Earth time it would be hundreds of thousands of years. GOD did not use a Rolex set to Earth time before creating everything.

GOD's creation IS an ever evolving universe in a scale and timeline beyond our comprehension.  I'm pretty sure about that.",1483315200,3,941,4.485380116959064
5058861,1,B00770XQEI,"Typical Creationist Augustinian proof of God by overwhelmed wonderment.  However, whether it's biology & evolution of geology & ""deep time"", they like to go back to the originators (i.e; Darwin and Hutton & Lyell) and present their case as if nothing has happened in the last 150+ years to strengthen the science. It's always easier that way. It's a reductionist tactic. What Creationists never point out is that for both Darwin & Hutton, 99% of the current science and evidence, which irrefutably supports the evolutionist/deep time case,, was never known by them. And it's a juggernaut of unstoppable facts---one block of evidence after another from DNA proofs for descent with modification to a rapidly expanding fossil record.
All of this means one thing---and not that belief in God is not possible--- but that the Genesis story for Creation is not a science textbook!",1483142400,24,873,5.104895104895105

8511408,3,B00770XQEI,"Beg to differ.  As to the lack of ""biblical"" associations, I think you need to get all the way to the end of the film to the credits to find it, but it's there!!  While a lot of good geology is included in the film, I think the producers tend to see it as an ""either-or"" battle, with catastrophism being the ""victim"" of uniformitarianism.  Doubtlessly it was in the olden days, but not so much today when both rapid and slow processes as concepts have been integrated into modern geology.  (It would be difficult not to notice the effect of a volcano on its surroundings for instance!)  Modern geologists look for both and look for them widely in order to study earth history.  The producers have also ignored the fact that things like turbidity currents don't happen on a daily basis but sedimentary processes do.  They also point to a lack of animal fossils where the animals might not even have been in the first place or where they would have left little visible traces of their having been there.  They also ignore the fact that the earth is not the same place as it was ""In the beginning!""  Life itself has changed it a lot.  Erosion and deposition, for instance, happened a lot faster and were more pervasive before plant life made itself onto land to resist natural processes than they did after that date.  They also ignore the chemistry of the pre-oxygen world and the post oxygen world.  Seems to me there was a little bit of cherry picking done here.  I laud the producer's providing an alternate view, but I would have appreciated hearing the ""other side of the story"" from a knowledgeable ""someone"" who disagreed with them.  It might have clarified some of the producer's issues with things like isotope dating--but then, I suspect such individuals would have clarified it for the viewers, too.  I agree that scientists are just as slow to accept change as the rest of us--poor old Alfred Wegener never did get to see the day when his notion of plate tectonics was accepted (I believe he died on a polar expedition long before then)--but sometimes there's a reason for it!",1499644800,,2086,4.615176151761518

8511411,4,B00770XQEI,"From my hands on studies of geology since 1963 in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma plus broad reading and observation of rocks from various other places I have to concur fully with this presentation. When the Christian Bible was translated into English the word day in Genesis was misapplied. According to two Rabbis I consulted the original term is better translated to English as era, epoch or age. My conclusion is that both sides of the 4 billion years versus 6 thousand years debacle iindulge the folly of biased people. ""A day is a thousand years and a thousand years are a day."" to God who is beyond time. A rational study of earth history requires, without bias,  inclusion of anthropology, paleontology, astronomy, astrophysics and archaeology.",1495929600,2,748,4.984

Contrary to some other reviews, this documentary is NOT an attempt to bolster the position of creationism - not at all.

It is a geology film, one hour long, so of course the ""data"" is ""cherry-picked"", due to the scope of the work and it's intended audience.

These emotionally driven, reactionary reviewers here on Amazon might as well burn another Bruno at the stake, or exile another Galileo, or even decry another Sagan, before they write disturbing critical reviews on Amazon.

If you are a student of geology, this film has real value, and if you are not, it still is approachable due to the sufficiently narrow scope of it's thesis and the thoughtful simplification of the underlying science.",1493337600,6,848,5.1231884057971016

It does open suggesting that early scientific views were influenced by religion, but on the whole it is not biblical pseudoscience as some are implying. Any good documentary will provide alternative views. I think most only watched the beginning then posted a review.
