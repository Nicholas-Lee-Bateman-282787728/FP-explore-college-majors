4667664,4,B005EVJCKO,"I'm not a great fan of musicals but this one won me over a few songs in, when it became clear this was not some schmaltzy precious view of Australian culture. Warm-hearted and post-modern, fun with an historical edge... it reeks of a new Australian Aboriginal confidence. It looks great too! Watch this instead of ""Australia""!",1326931200,7,326,4.839285714285714
4667665,5,B005EVJCKO,"I caught the show early one morning and fell in love with the characters, the storyline, and the amazing music.  Lots of predictible plot twists, but a great show with a lot of very sly humor throughout.  The music is hard to forget ... you will remember it and keep humming it for days to come!",1325462400,4,295,4.25
4667666,5,B005EVJCKO,"I watched this when I was living in Australia and fell in love with it. I am so happy it has finally come out in the US!
Be prepared to have these songs stuck in your head for days!",1318464000,4,181,3.6666666666666665
4667667,4,B005EVJCKO,"Saw this film in the theater with its Australian title Bran Nue Dae.  I don't know why they changed the title, but I absolutely love this film.  Great music and lots of fun.",1318464000,2,173,4.212121212121212
4667668,5,B005EVJCKO,"Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert meets Bollywood is the best way to describe this wonderful film.  Clever songs, fun dancing, and the perfect cast makes this film a must see.  I can't wait for the DVD to finally come out in the States.  This is what Hollywood should be putting out, instead of so many bad movies.  Original and uplifting, funny and unexpected, buckle your seat belts and hang on for the ride of your life...",1293840000,4,435,4.538461538461538
4667669,5,B005EVJCKO,"It is an absolute hoot.  The music is  fun and the ending is a crack up.  I to am proud to be an aborigine and happy to see you steal  my precious land from me,is a must hear and see movie.",1395014400,,189,3.5365853658536586
4667670,5,B005EVJCKO,"This heartfelt musical comes with the aid of Screen Australia. It is set in 1968 where we meet a young Aboriginal boy named Willy, whose burgeoning hormones are pulling him towards his sweetheart Rosie, but his born again Christian mum is pushing him towards Priesthood and the avoidance of all sinful thoughts, let alone sinful deeds. So instead of being able to enjoy the laid back and mellow pearl fishing coastal town of Broome, he is packed off to Missionary school for some not so `happy clappy' ecumenical teachings.

Once back in the clutches of Father Benedictus (played brilliantly in a pantomime stylie  by Geoffrey Rush), his life takes a turn for the miserable almost straight away. Then he makes the decision to stand up for his rights. This means that, despite performing a cracking tune with the refrain `There's nothing I would rather be, than to be an aborigine', he has to do a runner. This is the start of a road trip which will involves tramps, hippies and more adventures than you can shake a stick at.

I am not big on musicals, but this one is really funny, has real charm and some brilliantly over the top performances. The fab named Ernie Dingo (`Crocodile Dundee II') playing Uncle Tadpole is a case in point. Some of the acting is a bit third rate rep but because of the passion that jumps off the screen you really won't be too bothered.

This is just a load of fun, check out the treatment given to Tammy Wynette's `Stand by Your Man', just magical. So with a mix of original tunes and some well known numbers, the obligatory dance routines and black and white good and bad with some extra marital sex and a huge dose of fun thrown in - this all adds up to a really cracking little film. It put a smile on my face so I can only recommend.",1366934400,5,1768,4.464396284829721
4667671,5,B005EVJCKO,"This is a great movie.  There is one thingthat bothered me about this movie; ""the candy bar.""  What was in that candy bar that made those men eat it as if their life depended on it?  It seems as if the candy bar was used as a mean of controlling these people.",1357430400,,259,3.9423076923076925
4667672,5,B005EVJCKO,"Brand New Day may not be for everyone. I love the major characters, the music, and the gorgeous scenery of Broome, Western Australia. So it may be a little on the hokey side, but it is fun and certainly you can't help but feeling good when the curtain comes down.",1357257600,,263,4.28
4667673,5,B005EVJCKO,"I GOT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I AM ON A MISSION TO EXPLORE ALL THE STUFF MISSY HIGGINS HAS DONE THAT I CAN BUY.  I AM A FAN BUT NOT A NUT.  WELL MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF A NUT!!!LOL. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. WATCHED IT TWICE.  FUNNY, CHEEKY AND SWEET.  A LOVE STORY AND A REALLY COOL MOVIE.  MISSY WAS AWSOME AND SO WERE THE REST OF THE CAST.",1356480000,,329,3.710144927536232
4667674,5,B005EVJCKO,Highly recommended this movie has so much meaning and is portrayed in a way that may be missed by some but has insights in so many of the issues experienced by Indigenous Australians and the manner European influence has impacted on a proud and resilient peoples,1353801600,,262,4.717391304347826
4667675,2,B005EVJCKO,"I love musicals and I love Geoffrey Rush so this looked like a perfect movie for me! Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of time. The story was weak.

4667676,5,B005EVJCKO,Very entertaining and gives a different insight into Australian life back in the day and the cultural issues experienced. A feel good musical with comedic overtones.,1349654400,,165,5.384615384615385
4667677,3,B005EVJCKO,"This film was ok but not a great film. The action lagged at times. Overall it was worth my time, but it won't be long remembered.",1334448000,,129,4.0

8469080,2,B005EVJCKO,What a letdown! Interesting to see the Aboriginal actors but this story is disjointed and becomes downright weird at the end. Could have been uplifting but you end up shaking your head.,1490832000,,185,4.8125

8469082,1,B005EVJCKO,"This DVD is not compatible for US VCR technology, so it was a waste. Tried seeing it on YouTube, but all the music was deleted.
