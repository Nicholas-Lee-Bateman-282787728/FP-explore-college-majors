7413985,5,B014KEPD1M,"Aura: Koga Maryuins Last War is a 90-minute anime movie about love, chunibyo, and finding a healthy middle. It tells the story of Ichiro Sato, a young man entering high school after recovering from a multi-year bout with chunibyo, the Japanese phenomenon in which middle-schoolers immerse themselves so deeply in their own fantasy world that they have trouble distinguishing it from reality. Ichiro has left his past behind him and treasures hopes of a blissfully normal high school life until he accidentally links paths with an (unrelated) girl named Ryoko Sato. She dresses bizarrely and calls herself the Researcher, and her chunibyo is even worse than Ichiros used to be. This weird girl soon attracts bullies, and Ichiro is torn between sympathy and self-preservation. It will take a lot of love, patience, courage, and perhaps even the return of his carefully-buried alter ego, Koga Maryuin, to get them both out of high school in one piece.

Comparisons between this anime and the very similar series <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Chunibyo-and-Other-Delusions/dp/B00GTIQ7H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions</a> are inevitable, so lets start the review proper there. The first half of Aura is so similar to the setup of LC&D that it should have caused embarrassment among the scriptwriters. Ichiro and Ryoko are Yuta and Rikka all over again, with the exact same dynamic between socially-recovering  guy and cute-but-delusional-girl playing out the exact same way. Where the series diverge sharply, and Aura comes into its own, is in the second act. Where Rikka was able to cobble together a crew of misfit friends and never seemed to attract much negative attention beyond a few shrugs, things take a darker and more realistic turn in this movie.

Ryoko is bullied mercilessly by her classmates for her odd behavior, and its clear that while she has resources of toughness, shes also not made of stone. For his part, Ichiro views her with all the profound sympathy of a recovering addict, but he has spent 3 years clawing his way away from his old reputation, and every time he steps up to help her brings him ever closer to being sucked back into the social muck of delusion, bullying, and isolation. What the viewer comes to understand is that both Ryoko and Ichiro are suffering from an unhealthy denial of a key part of themselves. There is place in life for groundedness and pragmatism, for learning to fit in with others and enjoying a regular life. There is also place for wonder and speculation, for giving your imagination free rein and being yourself regardless of what others may think. Will these two figure this out in time to prevent a tragic ending? Weeeell no spoilers in this review. But its an excellent story.

The animation in this movie is a little nicer and more detailed than what youd usually see in a TV series, but not on par with a Miyazaki or Disney film, either. (Youll probably be quite satisfied but not wowed.) In terms of story pacing / length, the 90-minute run time means that we don't get everything we might have wished for. Personally, I would have loved to see more about Ichiros past as Koga and Ryokos present-day circumstances at home, but there just wasn't room for it to fit. I think, ideally, this would have been a 6-episode series (about 180 minutes) to fully flesh out all aspects, but I also have to admit I appreciated its brisk pace and the ability to finish it in one sitting. One-shots used to be common in anime back in the 1990s, but they're a rare breed nowadays, so Im tickled to see a single movie get licensed and released stateside. I will say that its overpriced  there are no bells and whistles here that in any way merit a $40 MSRP. Still, its well-worth it with a minor sale.

I should also mention that this movie *does* have an English dub as well as a subtitled version. Ive only watched the English dub so far, and I liked it. All of the parts were capably handled, and some were just excellent. My one minor complaint is not one of quality, but of casting  Ryokos English voice actress has a very adult-sounding voice on the rare occasions when she drops her usual monotone, and Im not sure it fit well with her immature character. Its not frequently noticeable, though, and like I said, she did a great job with the actual acting.

In closing, Aura ended up being a very different animal from Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions and is perhaps much better for it. I personally preferred its sweet story, good message, and realism to the other series silliness by a considerable margin, and I encourage you to give Aura a shot if you enjoy tales of weird love and figuring out where you belong.",1449273600,14,4745,4.856613102595797

8731072,5,B014KEPD1M,"Excellent show. The similarities to ""Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions"" is certainly present, but the differences are more than sufficient to ensure that it will stand on its own, without comparison. ""Aura"" was a great addition to my collection and extremely fun to watch. The drama picks up substantially toward the end, which relieves a lot of the humor that's been seen almost throughout, and is nonetheless worth EVERY minute. Highly recommended!!",1455580800,3,452,5.291666666666667
8731073,5,B014KEPD1M,"Very good. Much like the anime series, Chunbyo, but more of a what if. The heroine, Ryouko is like a more extreme version of Chunbyo's Rika,, but she lacks  her friends and companions. And she's very much alone but for the hero Ichiro. It's a story of fear and self-righteous bullying.  Some parts are hard to watch. IF you've been bullied, you know what i mean.",1454803200,,362,4.46969696969697

8731075,5,B014KEPD1M,An excellent film that anyone who felt like an eccentric or outsider in high school should see.  It also addresses issues such as bullying and suicide very well and respectfully,1454198400,2,177,4.9
