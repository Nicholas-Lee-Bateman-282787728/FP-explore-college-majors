8140547,5,B000HNLZ9A,"I, too, cast a vote FOR releasing this landmark and masterpiece series
on DVD.  If ever there was a first-person, living history series, ""The Life And Times Of Lord Mountbatten"" is surely it!  I have read that when others approached him for permission to do a TV/VHS series on his long and illustrious life, Lord Louis is said to have told them, ""No.  I'll do it myself!"" or words to that effect.  So here it is -- the story of a long, rich and varied Royal life, produced and narrated by the very Royal it is about -- proud member of the British Royal Family, Lord Louis Mountbatten! It is totally authentic, totally thrilling in all respects! It leaves an unmistakable memory in those who have seen it.  Even Lord Louis' voice -- Upper-class English to the core, but with a unique resonance and placing I have heard no-where else, (though a few traces of it can be heard in his ""honorary grandson's"" (Prince Charles's) speech, are worth the price of this wonderful, ""history-comes-alive"" series!

As most people today do NOT have VHS players, a DVD edition of this
landmark series would be MOST welcome.  (Hint: although Lord Louis ""fans"" like myself would buy this DVD set at ANY time, the coming Royal Wedding of Princess Victoria of Sweden, (scheduled to take place on the 19th June, 2010), will, at least temporairly, make the general public more aware of, and more interssted in, ALL things Royal, in ALL countries who have monarchies -- at least for a little while.  This would be the PERFECT time to release a DVD version of this historic
series. PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE make this DVD set version available by then....or by perhaps by the 25th of June, (Lord Mountbatten's birthday), of ANY coming year.  (But the sooner this DVD series is available, the more profits can be made!)  PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE!!!!!

P.S.; ......u p d a t e.......... 4th june, 2011;....The truth of the matter is, that i am one of the 'fortunate' ones, in that i have a TV-DVD-VCR combination appliance. And DiD possess this appliance, even as i wrote my original review. yes, it's very handy for watching Vhs tapes!
i have bought several -- including, today, finally this 6 VhS set on lord mountbatten.  i've saved $20 by waiting a while.....but the fact is, even for those who Do have a VhS player, VhS tapes up much too much room!  WoulD i buy a DVD set of lord mountbatten, should it come out/  yES!.  Then i'd sell  the VhS set i just bought.  Why/  Because, sadly, i Don't live in Buckingham palace, and could still use the room that a DVD version would save me!  i'm sure others are in the same position.  This is autobiography of the highest, and most literate kind.
For anyone who REAlly wants to know what REAlly goes on inside the head of those in the English royal family -- as well as getting a bird's eye view of World War i, World War ii, and the people who fought these wars, ThiS is the definitive series.

and more people would watch -- and buy -- this set, if only it were on DVD!!!!
Any time is a good time to increase people's awareness of history.  Any time is a good time to make this monumental series into a DVD collection.  however, with all the flurry of interest in the English Royal Wedding....THIS, especially, is the time to put this excellent documentary -- by a Royal, writing of world history from the inSiDE -- on DVD!  And have some extra copies made for the upcoming Diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth ii....which isn't too far off!",1268438400,,3460,4.59771986970684
8140548,5,B000HNLZ9A,"PLEASE release this wonderful series on DVD.  I'd buy it in England, but it's still on VHS not compatible in the USA.  There is no one in history quite like Mounbatten with all his intrigues, personal histories and extraordinary and quintessential British leadership.",1234051200,,267,5.186046511627907
8140549,5,B000HNLZ9A,"This video set should be reissued on DVD. This man led a most interesting life and it should be remembered by more people.  There could be updates from 1969 until Lord Mountbatten was murdered in 1979.

It is a very interesting series that was produced by his son-in-law Lord John Brabourne.",1184371200,,291,4.686274509803922
