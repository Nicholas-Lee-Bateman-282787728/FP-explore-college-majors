2549347,3,B000F2C7DG,"My youngest son wanted this based on previews. He wasn't thrilled with the movie and the dvd had an issue with speaking English (which is greatZ) then it went to a foreign language. Had to keep changing back to English. It did that on all our players, including the PC.

It was a cute movie (in my opinion)",1425772800,,306,4.275862068965517

8116498,5,B000F2C7DG,"The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of john stewart, who has been away only in spirit, as zeebad, the magnificent, shrewd old wizard. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.

Some, however, must be cited, especially Jimmy fallon, as the college-educated rabbit who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have stewart as his father; as well as whoopie goldberg, ian mckellen, kevin smith, william H. macy, kylie minogue, daiel tay, checy chase, and bill hader. Mr. fallon has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.

Doogal plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban carousel where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.",1480723200,,1523,4.876447876447877
