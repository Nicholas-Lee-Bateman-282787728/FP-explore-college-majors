3017821,5,B000YA0EHA,"So great to see these movies again.
The only downfall would be that they
are on widescreen and not full screen.
The Bali Hai song and scenery is magnificent
on full screen",1305417600,,171,4.375
3017822,4,B000YA0EHA,"I bought this as a late Christmas gift for my mom since she loves South Pacific. She hadn't seen the other two musicals in the pack, but we have watched them and she likes them too.
Each disc comes in its own thin case, all three going inside a box. There is a little bit of information on each film.

The only bad thing was that the shipping took so long. I ordered it a few days before Christmas with standard shipping, so I knew it wouldn't make it in time. However I didn't expect that it would take well over a month to finally receive it. It shipped from the other side of the US, but it still shouldn't have taken that long.

Anyway, great buy for anyone who likes classic musicals.",1269648000,2,689,4.172932330827067

3017824,5,B000YA0EHA,"Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals remain as timeless today as they were in the 40's, 50's, and 60's.  Three lavish and uplifting productions from the golden age of Hollywood, together for the first time, in one Boxed Set is a must-own for all DVD librarys!",1195430400,,253,4.75
