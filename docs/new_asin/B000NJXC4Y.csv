2770756,2,B000NJXC4Y,This movie was not terrible but one of those movies that left you thinking it could have been much better. Basically its about a girl(blonde haired thora birch) who has nightmares where she has brown hair and is being stalked by a killer called needle tooth. This brown haired thora is also having nightmare where she is blonde haired thora. The ending is kind of predictable as I saw it coming right away. Some gore in this and not many scary moments at all. I fell asleep about 30 mins it and had to rewatch it.,1179964800,10,513,4.354166666666667
2770757,3,B000NJXC4Y,Not a very good movie ... The only reason to watch it is for Thora Birch ... enough said.,1179964800,8,89,3.736842105263158
2770758,4,B000NJXC4Y,"If you're looking for a disturbing thriller to watch I really recommend this movie it keeps your interest from start to finish. Strange but interesting plot with a great ending.
Thora Birch is really good in this movie basically playing two different characters.",1239580800,6,262,5.116279069767442
2770759,4,B000NJXC4Y,"This is a dark creepy tale.  You must pay attention all the time to gain an understanding of what is happening.  This film is full of real dramatic acting, not another story of a slender, waif like female who possess incredible fighting prowess.

The vulnerability and confusion of the lead character is one of the movies many strengths.",1235865600,3,337,4.775862068965517
2770760,3,B000NJXC4Y,"Dark Corners (Ray Gower, 2006)

This movie had almost bottomless potential-- done right, it could have been one of those indie gems that becomes a cult favorite. There are flashes of that brilliance throughout the movie. But it never quite reaches its true potential, and there are times when it gets so badly derailed that it's incapable of getting back on track. Because of this, it's one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in recent memory, while I have to give writer/director Ray Gower respect for having had the ambition to take on such a formidable project in his first attempt at writing and directing a movie.

Thora Birch (American Beauty) plays two roles here. Susan Hamilton is a happily-married woman who's trying to get pregnant. When she falls asleep, she adopts an alter ego, Karen Clarke, who lives on the (very, very) bad side of town, works for a crazy undertaker, and is constantly followed by strange characters whose intentions are never certain. As the film goes on, we begin to wonder which of these realities is the ""real"" one, or whether Susan Hamilton and Karen Clarke are actually doppelgangers living in the same town. And what's the deal with the Night Stalker, the serial killer active in the city? What does he have to do with the story?

There's so much here. Gower has a wonderful ear for dialogue; there are scenes here that rival the best of Tarantino, as far as the script goes. The acting ranges from the competent to the brilliant; Birch, especially, has rarely been better. The cinematography is always interesting, if a bit obvious in its influences.

And therein lies some of the weak spots that pock the film; it's a little too much at times, in every respect. It's not just the cinematography. The symbolism rears out of the shadows and whacks you across the face every now and again. The script loses focus. The dialogue wears thin. In every case, the film gets back on track quickly, but each of the slips adds up. And then, by the time we get to the major derangement, it's all added up to the point where the movie drops out completely. It's unable to recover, and it just keeps spiraling downwards. But despite that, there's so much here that says that Gower's going to be a heavy hitter some day that I'm really looking forward to his next movie, to see if he's managed to control some of the downsides while not losing the upsides. ** ",1223510400,,2394,4.650118203309693
2770761,3,B000NJXC4Y,"I caught the edited-for-TV version on SciFi and when it started, it seemed like it might be just another bad SciFi Saturday night flick but I ended up watching this to the end. Kind of like a car wreck that you just have to turn & look, this film manages to be weird but still interesting enough to keep you watching and make you wonder what the heck is going on. One thing I liked about this film was the color of it - some of the outdoor scenes had an almost sepia color tone to it that really added to the mood the director wanted to create.  If you're a Thora Birch fan (as I became after seeing Ghost World), you'll probably like her in this, too.  This is on my will-buy list.  3 and a half stars.",1222128000,2,703,4.043165467625899
2770762,5,B000NJXC4Y,"I enjoy movies that I can't figure out immediately. I also like movies that are a bit odd, off-kilter so to speak. You know, films like MEMENTO, HEADSPACE, JACOB'S LADDER, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, etc. Well, DARK CORNERS fits right in with these other classics of bleakess and dread! Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World, The Hole) plays the dual role of Susan- in the sunny, happy world of light, and Karen- in the darkworld of nightmare. I was perplexed by what connection there could possibly be between these two women. I was pleasantly stunned by the answers at the end! The last movie to make my jaw drop (in a good way) was HIGH TENSION. DARK CORNERS had that same twisty, grabber of a final for me. So, if you are a fan of the macabre, weird, or creepy, then this one will be a treat...",1206576000,7,793,4.438356164383562
2770763,4,B000NJXC4Y,"Thanks to Thora this is much better than average. A weird dual world theme is explored in this clever but not great scare film. The script and direction are just okay. Nice look too. Not too graphic, more of a suspenseful mind game. A good example of the lead raising the whole production. Also see the obscure ""Left in Darkness"" for another good but not great film with a strong female part.",1200614400,3,392,4.458333333333333
2770764,4,B000NJXC4Y,"I bought this movie because it was a horror movie starring Thora Birch. I expected it to be a total piece of crap. I was suprised. It was a decent movie. There are movies such as THE MESSENGERS and PULSE which I bought thinking they were going to be good and for me personally, I thought this movie which I had no expectations of, was better than the two aforementioned movies which I thought would be good when I bought them.",1188950400,4,426,4.271604938271605
2770765,3,B000NJXC4Y,I had though DVD production companies stopped making widescreen for 3:4 only aspect ratio TVs since MGM got sued but I was wrong!  Apparently Anchor Bay did not get the message!  This movie is stated as 1:78:1 widescreen but it does not play that way on a real widescreen TV!  The picture is squashed!  Someday!,1182124800,5,311,4.6
2770766,3,B000NJXC4Y,"I sometimes have really vivid nightmares that are similar to the somber world the protagonist finds herself in when she sleeps.  Those sequences come closer to the look and feel of the sort of nightmare where everything seems sort of off key and grotesque than anything I've seen except maybe parts of Jacob's Ladder. If your significant other tends towards dreams of peaceful meadows with happy bunnies (OK, I admit I'm being sarcastic), but never has nightmares, and just doesn't understand why you sometimes wake up shaking and on the edge of tears from a harmless little dream, show him this.

I noticed the director is British. I wonder if a little of that is flavored by C.S. Lewis's Great Divorce, such as the bus trip with one end in Hell.",1181952000,12,747,4.694656488549619
2770767,3,B000NJXC4Y,"In one of the DVD's special features, the director notes this film is influenced by Japanese horror. That's a valuable fact to keep in mind while watching. It has that esoteric feel and pace so common in Japanese horror, though this film's resolution is slightly less accessible. Cast about for some message board discussions once you've read for some interesting theories and interpretations.

Beyond the plot, this is a visually interesting film. Color and lighting creating remarkable contrasts between the parallel story lines, each slightly surreal.",1181088000,11,554,5.441860465116279

8178880,2,B000NJXC4Y,"""Silent Hill"" meets ""The Life Before Her Eyes""  with a little bit of ""Primer"" (2005) thrown in to make it even more incomprehensible.  Generally regarded as the feature that convinced Thora Birch to take a long hiatus from acting - with only roles like this coming her way she wasn't going to miss any significant career opportunites.

Each sequence if taken in isolation is competently made, but they by design omitted the piece that would unify them into an engaging and coherent story. The DVD case explains that ""Dark Corners blurs the line between a troubled young woman's idyllic suburban conscious world and her horrific unconscious one"". But the conscious one is not all that idyllic and not even remotely interesting,  and the unconscious one somehow manages to be both disgusting and boring. And other than the periodic jarring transitions between them there is little to keep a viewer in a conscious state.

CAUTION - SPOILERS AHEAD  Nothing that takes place is real - the two parallel stories are either imagined, dreamed, or most likely the private hellish afterlife of a serial killer psychiatrist (Dr. Woodleigh experiencing Hell's flavor of the day torture as his just desserts).  But you are unlikely to figure this out with just one viewing and multiple viewings are simply too painful so you might as well cheat and search out all the spoilers you can find.  Cheating is appropriate because psychological horror thrillers these days are mostly about cheating. They simply ignore really challenging elements of a feature - like continuity, the language of film, viewer engagement, and suspense.  And first time writer/director Ray Gower takes mega-advantage or all the opportunities the genre offers a lazy filmmaker.

In the film's favor the production design is first class,  the editing is excellent,  each story has its own visual tone and together they produce a nice synergy,  and Birch is on screen for 90% of the sequences - turning in a good if not great performance and generally hiding any depression she was feeling at having to perform in something this idiotic.  The DVD claims it is the most electrifying performance of her career but it is more in the nature of Melissa George's physically exhausting performance in ""Triangle"" (2009).

What ultimately saves ""Dark Corners"" from being just another pretentious (yes it comes with a ponderous commentary) and cheapo bore,  is that the trailer in the DVD's special features is completely bland;  as if they are at a complete loss as to how to assemble actual clips that would make the film appear engaging and wouldn't dream of trying to lure you into viewing it.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1423094400,,2691,4.966517857142857
8178881,5,B000NJXC4Y,"I was surprised to find this movie. Not many people have heard of it. But I found it in gently used condition, and there were no problems while playing the DVD.",1387929600,,160,4.193548387096774
8178882,2,B000NJXC4Y,"As a Thora Birch fan, I ignored the negative reviews and purchased this movie based solely on my trust in Ms. Birch's ""judgement."" Boy, oh boy was I wrong. This movie had all the makings of a great script, very good actors, it was just executed poorly. The ""twist"" at the end is easily predicted within 30 minutes into the movie. Thora's acting was great and actually, all the actors did a very good job, the movie itself was just poorly written. I highly suggest renting this movie before making the leap to buy to see if it is your cup of tea. Still a Thora Birch fan, just a poor movie role choice.",1324944000,,601,4.280701754385965
8178883,4,B000NJXC4Y,"Horror movies aren't usually my first choice in entertainment,but I'm developing a bit of a crush on Thora Birch. It's coming along quite nicely. Although this movie is a bit scary and disturbing,Miss Birch looks so good throughout it that I enjoyed it quite a bit. If you are the type who really likes horror movies,you ought to like this one. If you like Thora Birch you might REALLY like it A LOT.",1322352000,,400,4.493150684931507
8178884,1,B000NJXC4Y,"Sometimes I wonder if everyone on this site is reviewing the same film.  Dark Corners (2006) was pure discarded film school material with Thora Birch suddenly moving back and forth between two different people having two different hairstyles.  So, we've got a fuzzy killer that looks like a deadly Hip Hop Dance hall DJ from New Jersey, and a girl who hides from the killer in a dream.  Oh, scary.

The film stagnates due to being shot on a lousy digital camera, so it views like an inferior home video, and really bad acting makes this film difficult to watch.

The dull story played out as if it had been made up as it went along from scene to scene, the gore/fx were poor and unbelievable, and the so-called anxiety sequences were supremely lacking in zest or vivacity.

Absolutely no plot whatsoever except the deadly Hip Hop killer randomly killing people in gruesome ways.  This movie was supposed to be a film like David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and yet it was the dullest thing ever.

Everything about this movie was irritating, especially the ending, which was far and away one of the worst conclusions I've yet come across.",1288915200,5,1136,4.673366834170854
8178885,4,B000NJXC4Y,"I had to watch this movie more than once to get exactly how creepy it is.  I would encourage anyone who is into the Horror or Supernatural genre to give this movie a shot. It will leave you wondering what is real or the nightmares that lurk down deep inside all of us.  Thora Birch is brilliant in a duel role. And Christien Anholt (who plays her devoted husband in the film) isn't hard to look at either. There's a line Thora's charactor delivers in the movie that has stayed with me and kind of haunts me to this day: ""Hell is having your sins pulled from the dark corners of your soul and served up to you in a continuous loop."" Or something to that affect.  I gave it four stars based on the fact that it is quite possibly the strangest movie I've seen to date.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Corners/dp/B000NJXC4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Corners</a>",1265932800,2,905,4.940789473684211
8178886,1,B000NJXC4Y,"I really don't know what the other reviewers were smoking when they watched this movie.  This has gotta be a contender for one of the absolute most abysmal films of all time.  It is exploitative, disgusting, poorly acted, poorly shot, and looks to have been edited with a dull paring knife.  When my stomach wasn't churning at the gratuitous splatter and random creepiness, it was turning over from the stilted dialog and wooden delivery of the actors.

The box cover copy cites David Lynch as an influence/comparison to this film.  David Lynch is an artist, and his works are incomparable to this mess that would get you booted out of film school. This is a low-budget exploitation of gore and misogyny.  The creator of this movie is simply a butcher--of women, and of celluloid.

If you can actually sit through this nonsense with any kind of appreciation for it, I pity you.",1247011200,3,877,4.730263157894737
