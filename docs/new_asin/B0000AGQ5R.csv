7996891,4,B0000AGQ5R,"And part of Maritime's Live In San Francisco series, of which I own many a title. These are VERY low budget DVDs, and have to be taken at face value. Most of the artists featured on the series made their way into the format for the first time in this way, like Isaacs and Don Carlos, making those titles unique visual documents I cherish.

Like every other release on the series, the gig takes place in the late 90's and is filmed with just 3 cameras, one of them of lesser quality. Pic is 4:3, with a not-so-hot bitrate and lossy layer MPG 1 sound.

Yes, Gregory's voice doesn't sound as silky as on the albums, due to a)this is a live show and the voice is less processed and b)the guy is very old now but keeps groovin' !! . Hope the reviewer who bashed him for being old, pot-bellied and whatnot will still be active at that age !!

Editing doesn't allow to see all the action and granted, it's amateur at best, with several fading to black between several songs but kept me happy for the whole 75' . Menues are a nightmare to navigate so I suggest you choose the play all option and sit back and enjoy.

The sound is smooth and soothing in true Isaacs' fashion, with a purposely soft guitar and adequate bass and drums with yet lesser aggro on the upper end of the spectum (cymbals) which are still audible on a good stereo. My Klipsch towers and sub allowed me to get away with a flat signal.

If you like the artist and the genre this is a must-have. If you're a casual listener with an OCD for sonic and visual perfection, you might better give it a pass.",1387929600,,1563,4.231543624161074
7996892,3,B0000AGQ5R,"I own this DVD. (as for the other reviewer, i do not care about the man's appearance, ""we do not stay young forever).

The BAD:

1. Poor quality video and Editing.

a. Inexperience camera man that cannot even pan a tripod left and right smoothly. (blip, blip, blip)
b. Poor camera angle. I would have liked to see the keyboard player playing the melody. No one care about the lead guitar player which you cannot even hear or the strum piano which plays one simple tone that must be there in all original reggae songs.
c. superimposed movements.
d. One camera better than the other

2. Poor quality audio. (Get better as you watch)  listen to the DVD overtune and you will see what i mean. Overtune is the clip of video that pop up when you insert a DVD, sometime you cannot skip or FF it. The audio sound like muffled audio with very  little treble added. I have heard the actual intro (which is missing from this DVD) and it is high quality sound. This was from an mp3 file. I am not sure if a CD version is available (hope not from the same source)

3. As for his voice, any CD or DVD created around this time or later sounds the same which is acceptable (the aging thing)

The GOOD:
The best thing about this DVD is the song selection.

1. Number one
2. Stranger in town (I wanna love you in the morning)
3. Tune In
4. Soon Forward (turn your lamps down...you turn me on...)
5. Private beach party
6. All I have is love
7. Love is overdue
8. Thank you medley
9. Not the way (the daughter take a little longer)
10. Objection overruled (please give a chance)
11. Rumors
12. Sad to know you're leaving
13. Cool down the pace
14. The border
15. Oh what a feeling
16. Night nurse/private secretary
17. Big all round (ragamuffin)
18. Front door

As you can see,  that is one wicked selection that u don't find elsewhere. This is the first time I hear so much song from the 1982 lsland/mango album (night nurse). Listing 2, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16. Every song from this album was a hit.

The only songs missing to complete your satisfaction is Top ten (always included the intro medley but often not performed, don't know why), The Storm (you know, hang on..), Slave driver (low mi meck me gawn), red rose for Gregory, and hard drugs.

To update, I heard a version on YT that has better audio but was playing in only 1 channel

Over all it is acceptable' but if cranking up your system is your idea, you will not get a clean sound.

The band was excellent with no off tune moments. Note thou that live shows usually play songs up tempo (faster) this is so you don't fall asleep at the event...just kidding.",1360627200,,2596,4.280163599182004
7996893,2,B0000AGQ5R,"I was really excited to open up this DVD, crank up the volume, and skank along with the one and only Gregory Isaacs. Unfortunately I was disappointed from the outset. The video quality is quite poor (along with camera-work and editing) and Gregory himself was a sad sight. A once handsome, confident, strapping figure, he is now reduced to a grey-haired, pot-bellied, teetering old shell of himself. What's equally disappointing is the obvious weakness of his once strong, silky voice. In fact, his songs often sound best when he turns his mike to the audience (which he does constantly throughout the show). Gregory has been such a wonderful part of the reggae world that it's heartbreaking to see what he's become. On the positive side, the song selection is excellent and the 5.1 audio really sounds great. If your a huge Isaacs fan you may want to fork over the cash to get this disc, otherwise take that same money and purchase one of his many, many classic cds.",1099440000,6,967,4.727810650887574
7996894,5,B0000AGQ5R,Gregory is fantastic.  The band is incredible.  This is a must for any reggae fan- a must.  I only wish there was some cedits given to this fantastic band members. I wish there names were printed.,1085097600,,196,4.388888888888889
