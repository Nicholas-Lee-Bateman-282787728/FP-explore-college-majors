4471128,2,B004UV3KRU,"Judge Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict-- Collecting together ten episodes from Season Two, The Smurfs: A Magical Smurf Adventure contains two discs of Smurf-tastic adventures.

Sadly, and not completely unexpectedly, The Smurfs proves to be really quite boring. Every episode follows the same formula, opening with the Smurfs picking berries (or some other such chore) before stumbling upon that particular episode's McGuffin that will almost certainly lead to them battling their perennial nemesis, Gargamel. There's a little slapstick along the way--usually at Gargamel's expense--and a magic potion or two. If you're lucky the episode may even feature a few armor-clad knights on horseback racing into battle, but it all just becomes tiresome, very, very quickly. Another thing I'd forgotten, but didn't take long to aggravate me no end, was the unfathomable decision to have the eponymous characters throw in the word ""Smurf"" randomly into sentences as if it were a verb or noun. Seriously, what the Smurf is that all about? It's Smurfing annoying. Sorry, I'll Smurf off.

All that said: it's hard not to be a little taken aback by how endearing the innocence on show is. My son certainly seemed to enjoy a handful of episodes, particularly one where the Smurfs must confront a fire-breathing dragon, though any kids over the age of five--and most probably raised on a diet of Ben 10 and Kick Buttowski--will find little to entice them back after their initial viewing. Therein lies the problem with this set. Though collectors will no doubt relish the opportunity to grab these classic episodes on DVD, it's questionable how well they'll play to anyone else beyond the preschool crowd.

A Magical Smurf Adventure shows few signs of any real effort having been put into it. Picture quality is disappointing, with no restoration work done to improve the aging transfer. As such colors lack vibrancy, and softness is prevalent. The mono soundtrack is--as one would assume--flat, though dialogue is generally easily discernable. Two extras are included, ""Smurf Speak,"" which teaches the user how to ""express yourself the Smurf way,"" and ""Smurftastic Moments,"" which features the Top Ten moments from Season Two of the show.

 Lucky I was not using this as a gift. Very disappointed this time!",1350432000,,242,4.627906976744186
8442315,3,B004UV3KRU,"It seems that Warner Bros. is getting lazy in releasing the full seasons of the Smurfs to DVD, as the video quality is not the best. In A Magical Smurf Adventure, we only get ten episodes on two discs, running about 190 minutes. The back of the DVD box says it is the Second Season, but it is actually mixed episodes from the entire series. Talk about false advertisement! Why doesn't Warner Bros. just release a full season for us fans? I'm hoping with the new Smurf movie sequel being released next year, that maybe there will a new Smurf full season DVD out.

Smurf Van Winkle

8442317,5,B004UV3KRU,"10 more episodes from season 2.
Yes they are milking these out for all its worth rather than just putting the seasons out individually or maybe in a collection, but hey, its great to even be able to own the old Smurfs cartoons.
My 4 year old grandson loves coming over to pappa's house and watching pappa smurf cartoons along with a lot of the oldies, like Wacky Races, the Jetsons, Yogi Bear and Underdog.",1323388800,,406,4.426666666666667
8442318,3,B004UV3KRU,I do not understand why the release of Smurf episdodes is so tedious.  Boomerang Network showed better episodes than this DVD during the week before the Smurf Movie premeried..  I still want to know what happened to the epsidoes where Baby Smurf was brought by Stork.  I do recall Gargamel in at least one of the episodeas.  Placing 10 episodes on two disks should be against the law.  However the DVD producers do not care because the Smurf cartoons will sell no matter what episodes are presented.,1314403200,12,499,4.689655172413793
8442319,4,B004UV3KRU,"""You know what they say, 'Once you go blue...'""
- Grouchy Smurf, ""The Smurfs"" movie

The Smurfs return again on not one, but a two-disc set !  On those discs are ten new-to-DVD episodes from the second season such as ""Smurf Van Winkle"", ""Revenge of the Smurfs"", ""The Blue Plague"", and ""Sister Smurf"".

Along with these episodes are some Smurfy special features.  One is called ""Smurf Speak: Express Yourself the Smurf Way"", where it's basically how to talk like a Smurf by smurfing the term ""smurf"" in everything you smurf, or say.  It's smurfly simple, if you know what you mean.  The other feature is ""Smurftastic Moments"", which is basically the top ten moments in the Smurfs' second season.

I know the Smurfs may not resonate with the youth of this generation, despite some new comic books and a 3-D movie out now, but folks who grew up with the Smurfs should be adding this DVD set to their collections.",1313798400,5,909,4.64375
