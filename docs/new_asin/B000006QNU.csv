8134645,4,B000006QNU,"Consists of four episodes; one each on Frankenstein, Dracula, Jekyll and Hyde, and the Hound of the Baskervilles, the last being the best of the bunch. I loved the actual program, especially since the tapes contained the uncut versions of the four episodes, yet price was more than a little too high and the picture quality was disappointing, not bad but less than expected even allowing for the inferior status of VHS compared to DVD.",1355443200,,435,4.8133333333333335
8134646,5,B000006QNU,"This fascinating and fun series covers the novels ""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" + the short story ""The Body Snatcher"", and finally, ""Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles"". You not only get background information about the stories & their authors, but get to see many of the places which inspired them. I highly recommend this tape set to anyone interested in literature, stories of the supernatural, & history alike!",998870400,2,447,5.222222222222222
