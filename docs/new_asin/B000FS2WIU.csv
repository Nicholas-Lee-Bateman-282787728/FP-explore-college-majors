2582785,2,B000FS2WIU,"This documentary covers an urgent topic, but does so poorly. It opens with a series of interviews. The persons interviewed cannot separate emotion from fact, and the unedited result is inadequate journalism. Protestors interviewed in this film are not even fully versed in the agressive force with which Monsanto pursues rewriting the social, legislative and financial code of our land so as to bind itself to every aspect of US food production. This includes tearing family farmers from their land by prosecution via Monsanto's own custom patent laws governing untested bio-engineered seed, and replacing that farm family with a big business farmer who complicitly buys Monsanto seed and its genetically-locked fertilizer. Fortunately for viewers, The Future of Food (2004) is available here as well. The Future of Food is an actual documentary - in that it presents evidence, facts and case studies and documents what is being said, as opposed to flinging at the screen laundry lists of unverifiable offenses, government cover-ups, and ""dupes"" of the public. I have awarded a second star in my rating merely for the film's subject matter. I cannot give it for its bravery in publicly presenting anti-Monsanto data (which presents real risk, as M prosecutes all comers), since this 2005 film rides on the coattails of The Future of Food. The Future of Food is excellent; watch it.  :)",1267142400,9,1385,5.155555555555556
2582786,5,B000FS2WIU,"This is one story that the entire world needs to hear.  Sickness is not an accident.  It happens when the food is tainted, the air and water are polluted and much more.  Monsanto must be eliminated. They are killing us and it knows no borders or limits.  They are being investigated by the feds for monopoly and lots of charges.  Let's pray they are put under control.
I doubt it though.  They will pay off the courts and the investigators.",1266710400,2,440,4.4375
2582787,5,B000FS2WIU,"This is one DVD I highly recommend. I've seen virtual every DVD available on the subject of major corporations genetically altering our food and I found that this film is one of the most informative. But there's more. From what I can see of the other reviews, no one mentions the awesome bonus interviews. As a bonus, the producers have included an array of bonus interviews. On its own merits the bonus interviews alone make this DVD well worth owning and sharing with family and friends, a fact that has been overlooked by the other people who left reviews. In addition I recommend two other films:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Genetically-Modified-Food-Panacea-or-Poison/dp/B000A3456W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Genetically Modified Food - Panacea or Poison</a>. This film seems to be a sister film to Bad Seed, as the cover is similar and the publisher is the same, but the filmmaker is different and the content goes into additional information making both films complementary to each other. It also includes a bonus film produced by the Gorilla News Network called Contaminated. The bonus film and the main feature are awesome and makes this DVD also an important one to own. The other film I recommend deals with the animal or meat side of the Genetically Modified Food problem. The title is a little crazy but this 2 DVD set is called:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Science-Animal-Transgenics/dp/B000ILYZ2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Science: Animal Transgenics</a>. This DVD is loaded with bonus features as well as a well researched film and provides an important piece to the issue at hand. Once I saw these films, I realized I must now be more caraful about what I eat.",1259452800,6,1798,5.737827715355805
2582788,3,B000FS2WIU,"This video started out slow with the type of rants you might find on you tube, and later became more factual. There were definitely some interesting facts, but only some were in the video. There were more interesting facts in the extras, but I didn't watch many of those yet as I was sort of burned out on the bologna that should have been edited out. I was hoping this would be a video I could share with people to help them become aware of whats going on in our food industry/government right now, but I wouldn't want to FFWD through all the opinions and rants. It was worth watching and if you consider the cost of going to the theater these days Like I did to see FOOD INC. ( which I also bought, great movie) it was worth the cost.",1253836800,3,736,4.190140845070423
2582789,4,B000FS2WIU,"If you haven't already educated yourself about the hazards of genetically engineered food you should certainly watch this documentary. It has some very compelling interviews with leading scientists, researchers, activists and farmers and presents the facts about how our food supply is being high-jacked by large corporations.

It is not as polished as the ""Future of Food"", another documentary on GMOs, but it really gets the message across and focuses much more on the potential health hazards. It lays bare the background of the chief conspirator - Monsanto, and their long criminal history.",1195948800,8,594,5.387096774193548

If you care what goes into your body, and the body of your family, watch this video. Be prepared to be outraged at the fleecing of Americans about what you eat - don't be so TRUSTING of your food in your supermarket! ""They""  (the FDA and others who 'approve' products for human consumption) do not have your be$t intere$t in mind, nor do the drug companies who keep you en$laved by offering you drug$ to take away symptoms of your poor diet. No more excuses America - stand up for healthy food, watch this video and think about what you are doing to yourselves! No need to be paranoid - just get educated!

If you are running late and have to put gas in your car, would just fill it with water from the hose by your garage to save time? NO! Your car would sputter and not work properly. This is what you do to your body when for convenience sake - you put fast food, GMO food and other crud into an amazingly designed machine - YOUR BODY! Do you take better care of your car than you do your own vehicle/body?",1193702400,15,1194,4.8431372549019605
2582791,4,B000FS2WIU,"This is crucial information to get out to everyone who eats!  This DVD does a good job at waking us up to the ""Truth"" about the corruption amongst the FDA and the Agro-Chemical industry. It's a must see and a must pass on to everyone concerned about the health and well being of others and our planet. As the film suggests, we as individuals have the power to stop this. INSIST ON ANSWERS from your local grocery, from your local farmers, from your local governments. The film's presenters seem truthworthy and articulate very clearly the loss of FDA accountability for our food safety, the lack of research about GMO's and the dismissal of our right to choose and know about what we put in our bodies. This is a low budget production, but it's rawness matches it's message.",1178928000,19,774,4.608695652173913
2582792,5,B000FS2WIU,"I saw the feature length version of this film in the theater, then purchased

this special edition.  The special edition has extra interviews with various

experts.  It was really informative.  As with the movie itself, you probably

have to watch the extras twice to absorb all the information.",1164844800,34,295,5.041666666666667
2582793,1,B000FS2WIU,I purchased Bad Seed to use in my nutrition class.  I was very disappointed.  It had no narration to lead the events and the videography was very amateurish.,1163030400,7,157,4.571428571428571
2582794,4,B000FS2WIU,"If you didn't know that 60% of food sold in North America contains ingredients of genetically modified plants and that the ingredients are hazardous to human health and the planet, you will really know it after seeing this video.

""Bad Seed - The Truth About Our Food"" is a relatively low budget but highly effective documentary with a gripping story and credible information. The video contains interviews with a wide range of experts as well as just activists and farmers.

Unlike many documentaries this one doesn't include a bunch of cheesey footage from public domain stock footage from the 50s and 60s. Intead it uses parodies of Monsanto ads to add a little spice of humor.

The animation sequences are good and there is a segment on the evils of Monsanto that really brings the message home.

This video is not nearly as polished or as boring as the other documentary on GMOs ""The Future of Food"" and focuses more on the health consequences of GMOs rather than the impact on agriculture.

If you eat, you must watch this video, otherwise you won't really know what you are eating or the consequences of your eating choices.",1150156800,67,1131,4.75

8125844,3,B000FS2WIU,"Would've given this a 1star, but I didn't watch it all the way through... so to be fair I gave it 3.  From what I did watch it's all propaganda, bad video of cops at protests (there wasn't enough video to know what was really happening), and ordinary people giving opinions.  I have watched a number of documentaries on GMO's, have done a lot of reading on the subject, and I try to avoid them myself, so I'm not against the theme... just the way it's presented.  But don't take my word for it, watch the video for yourself (or as much of it as you can bear) and decide if you like it.",1505347200,,585,4.114035087719298
8125845,5,B000FS2WIU,Very enlightening.  I just wish more people would educate themselves about what they are putting in their bodies.
