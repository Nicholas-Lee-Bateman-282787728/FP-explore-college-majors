7866284,5,630427520X,"This video is great for anyone looking to learn about Robert E. Lee.  It may be a bit too general for people that have read and studied the man though it does have great Civil War Historian commentary and may offer new insight.  For the novice, I highly recommend this video as it covers the basics and general character of the man.  This video is done very well and like the rest of the Civil War Journal Series, it is worth buying!",1031443200,2,433,4.2560975609756095
7866285,5,630427520X,"This is an interesting and many times overlooked part of the Civil War that carries tons of information.  This video takes a civilian look at the battle and the horrible aftermath at Gettysburg. It covers several townspeople and shares their stories of helping and providing for the wounded while trying to make sense of the chaos at their doorstep.  It also brings forth the handling of medical care and also how the Gettysburg National Cemetery was constructed where Lincoln gave his Gettysburg address. True to the rest of the Civil War Journal Series, this video is backed by informative narration and key interviews with leading Civil War Historians.",1031443200,3,655,5.055555555555555
7866286,5,630427520X,"GREAT VIDEO!
A MUST SEE for any Civil War buff, or anyone who saw and really enjoyed the TV movie ""Gettysburg"".
This video TRULY brings out the vast expanse and grandeur of the last major fight in the Gettysburg battle, and tells a stirring story of the courage of Confederate General Armistead, as he fearlessly led his loyal men against a relentless barrage of Union rifles and cannon.
In a more general sense, folks who like war stories, and stories of great human courage and leadership, will appreciate this video.",1031443200,6,519,4.777777777777778
7866287,5,630427520X,"This is an outstanding video; the best from a number of videos in the Civil War Journal series. The true and poignant stories of Tillie Pierce Alleman, Jennie Wade, John Burns et al, receive the recognition and  treatment they deserve in this film.  The unnamed young actress portraying  Tillie Pierce is especially believable and effective in the role.  The  narration provided by Woody Christ, Greg Coco, et al, also is very  well-done.  This is a superb addition to the film libraries of Civil War  enthusiasts...to be watched again and again.",956880000,7,546,4.988888888888889
