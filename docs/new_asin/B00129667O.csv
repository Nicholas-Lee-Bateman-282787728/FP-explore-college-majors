8244796,1,B00129667O,"I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about house dance. I was disappointed in the quality of recording, the lack of confidence in the teacher's voice, and the painfully slow instructions. I had hoped to get 10 times what I did for the $25 expense. Not the best purchase in my opinion.",1265673600,,286,4.415094339622642

8244798,2,B00129667O,"This vid is 30min. It covers a small amount of house basics. The ""instructor"" is a decent dancer but a questionable teacher.

See that clip someone posted below?  THe 5min Freestyle at the end is the best part.  If the teacher tried to teach 1/10th of those steps it would be worth the money. lazy? stingy?  some accident during production?  dunno, why they chose to short change the vid.  the best you can do is try to mimick that freestyle clip. you can get the same and better from hundreds of other house freestyle and competition clips for free on youtube.

ALSO: for some reason they mic the floor.  so you can hear the guys sneakers squeeking louder than his voice.  and, like many low budget dance videos, they haven't figured out how to do the audio.  they have a nasty sounding (cheap boom box?) house cut in the background.  its the same cut over and over, and they keep restarting it in the middle of this guys lesson.  even the instructor is thrown off by this bad choice.

If this vid comes up used - I would recommend copping it at about ten bucks.  Its only 30min.  If it was two hours I'd have felt ok with the 25 price.  the other house videos I own are at a much higher production value and drop much more knowledge for the $.",1213747200,4,1245,4.301724137931035
