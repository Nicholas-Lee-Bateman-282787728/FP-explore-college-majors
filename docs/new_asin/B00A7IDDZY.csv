8547905,1,B00A7IDDZY,"Sorry but this was not very enjoyable, poor stories, not a whole lot of gore and poor acting. The few special effects there is looks like it was purchased from a Halloween store.",1435017600,,178,4.424242424242424
8547906,2,B00A7IDDZY,"The film consists of five shorts that total 92 minutes involving zombies. The segments star females who prove that even they can't overcome low budget and bad sound. The episodes had glimmers of cleverness, but couldn't capitalize on it to make it entertaining. Erica Rhodes gave us a very animated and interesting performance that would be better used in theater than on screen.

Interesting but not a barn burner.

8547907,4,B00A7IDDZY,i got this  for one reason and one reason only in two words erica rhodes,1417132800,,72,3.8
8547908,1,B00A7IDDZY,"This film? is terrible.  I couldn't watch beyond the six minute mark, based on the lack of production values and lack of talent of the performers.  The worst sort of ""filmed by my brother with a handi-cam' garbage.  Can't testify to the make up or special effects - couldn't get that far.",1415750400,,288,4.5
8547909,4,B00A7IDDZY,"A Swedish folklore tale, more than a true Zombie story. It still delivers a fair amount of creepiness. 3 men and 3 women go to the woods for a get away, only to realize their cabin is a ""little strange"", if it may be put that way. The folk tale is that a creature lives underground, and should NOT be looked in the face, and should be avoided at all costs. Of course they ALL make the worst decisions, and pay the dearest of costs. Some of the impact is lost in the translation to English, but still delivers a lot of scares and horror.
Kudos for making a true horror film on an extremely tight budget!
May be too intense for the younger kids, and includes a tete au tete...
Great for a Saturday night scare fest...Enjoy!",1413504000,,721,4.231884057971015
8547910,1,B00A7IDDZY,"im with case all the way on amateurish acting and overall content...but one other thing---this was filmed in an awful format, I had to zoom the tv screen out to get the full frame and keep from getting dizzy from the jostling camera...if you're destined to watch it---watch it on your pc, not a big screen...if you're sitting on the fence over it---I'd pick a another flick",1393718400,,373,4.582089552238806
8547911,2,B00A7IDDZY,"Sometimes I think the ones writing some of these reviews are the people that actually made the movies cuz after reading the other review on this movie I was excited to rent this, only to find it was a zombie movie where the zombies looked like really cheap halloween costumes...and the acting seemed like something you'd find in a mediocre high school play....sorely disappointed!!!",1389139200,2,382,4.984375
