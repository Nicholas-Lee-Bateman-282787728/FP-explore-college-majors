4435266,4,B004N21KIC,"This movie was headed in the direction of being one of the greatest lesbian romances on film.  As others reviewers have said it had good acting, direction, plot, and hot stars with chemistry.  It avoided most of the tropes that ruin a lot of indie and lesbian films.  Almost no excessively wordy dialog - a little bit of psyco-babble, (almost) no pretensiousness, no dead lesbians (just dead parents of a lesbian).

However, I do want to complain about the McMansion set.  Too many a good indie film has been marred by giving the characters implausible real-estate holdings.  It was probably shot in the home of one of the project's finacial backers.  The flim maker even seemed self consious about this.  The whole dead parents thing seemed to happen merely as a way to explain why a poor professor would own such a grand home - she inherited it.  If you are that worried about it why not just find a dingy apartment to shoot in?

I want to give Sarah Stouffer a shout-out for her performance during the first sex scene.  She did a fantastic job conveying the whirlwind of anxiety and excitement that comes with the thrill of new love.  Was it all acting or was she really that scared?  The mighty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desert-Hearts/dp/B000053VAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desert Hearts</a>&nbsp;is probably the only lesbian film with a better sex scene.

In general it was humming along nicely until it went off the rails near the end.  It wouldn't be fair to critize the film because the characters didn't get a happily ever after.  The real problem is that the editor simply ran out of time to properly tidy up all the dangling threads of the story.  At the climax of the story the characters have a very painful break-up.  But then they just sort of make-up at the end without relsoving the hurtful things that passed between them.  The editor should have pushed to a full 90 minutes.  Seven extra minutes would have made all the difference in the world.  Also there is a somewhat irrelevant scene at an airport (part of the dead parents McMansion issue) that consumed too much time in the middle of the story.  It could have been done in half the time or cut entirely.  Those precious minutes could have been more effectively used to fill-out the resolution of the relationship.

Never the less, I think the overall film is as at least as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loving-Annabelle/dp/B001BOIT66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loving Annabelle</a>.  By the relatively poor standards established by other lesbian films, this one is a good solid effort that narrowly missed greatness.  It is a must see for anyone who considers themselves literate in lesbian themed films.  Certainly worth the $2.99 to rent it on Amazon Instant video.  In the context of it's indie/lesbian peers I'm giving this movie 4 stars out of 5.  But in the broader universe of movies it is a 3.5 star film.",1304985600,73,2993,5.075819672131147
4435267,4,B004N21KIC,"I did like the movie, I think half of it was because the women in the movie were great actresses and they were amazing to look at. I would have liked a bit more build up in the film though from the kisses to the ""relationship"" but I do suppose it was perfect for what the characters/story was trying to achieve. There was angst in the movie I'll give it that and even though it was a sad ending - maybe they're be a sequel? I doubt it also but it leaves room for one to wonder with the story and where the characters could go with or without each other.",1304812800,5,553,3.990990990990991
4435268,3,B004N21KIC,"Saw this last night and have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, the storyline had tremendous potential (as other reviewers have noted) and the leads were very attractive.  On the other hand, there was virtually no character development nor development of the relationship itself.  We have no clue, by the end of the film, what makes Catherine the predator she seemingly is, other than that she is lonely. Also, we have no clue what attracts these two women to each other. There is a hint, from the younger  woman's end, of a mother-child relationship. But I was frankly quite stumped as to why someone as accomplished and gorgeous as the teacher (Catherine) would go for someone so infantile and underdeveloped/ under-exposed.  Loneliness just doesn't explain it. The film ""Loving Annabelle"" did such a better job with the teacher-student relationship and the character development around a complicated dynamic.  I wish this filmmaker had done the same, given the potential of the plot and the actresses. In spite of all that, I enjoyed the film and found it quite a guilty pleasure! Oh...one other thing, don't expect any hot love scenes. Beyond the kissing, the love scenes are PG rated and cut away right when things start to get interesting!",1304726400,14,1252,4.942857142857143
4435269,3,B004N21KIC,"lots of potential in the way the film began...attractive main characters, decent acting (by them both at least), interesting plot...then the last 45 minutes felt disjointed from the character development and existing plot outlined by the first half of the film...developing the characters fully and exploring their love would have made a great film...instead the movie took a tangent at the end that was implausible and simply irrelevant. oh well, the professor was especially talented; the child actor seemed too young for the casting and too short for the costar but she made up those challenges with her solid acting talent too.",1303344000,9,631,5.196078431372549
4435270,4,B004N21KIC,"I thought this would be a copycat to Loving Annabelle, but its actually not. Sarah Stouffer plays Jackie the college student and if you ask me she looks more like a middle school student than college. Really she looks like she is 15-17 years old. Anyways the film has some strange moments. For example out of nowhere one of Jackie's friends says that everyone knows she's been ""banging a teacher"" But we don't know how they found out and noone seems to care. The teacher of course got fired, but we don't see anything bad happen to Jackie, other than a little fight. We don't get to see her parents reaction, Principle never talks to her, the photos never reached ""Hollywood"" I also didn't like the ending. Since Catherine (Allison McAtee) was fired she had nothing to keep her in that city. had I been Jackie I would have asked her to go to Cali with me.

There is not enough fleshing out of the characters or their relationship, and instead a decent plot arch eats up the character dynamic.

What's good about this movie is very solid, and what works does well, but the ending is too rushed hitting all the beats to leave room for the characters.

Couldn't they find an actress who didn't look so young.  The dynamic of the two lead actresses just did not work.  The older character acted more like her mom which was so gross.  The movie was also highly predictable which was another drawback.  I would save your money and watch ""Loving Annabelle"" instead.",1440979200,2,456,4.5
4435298,1,B004N21KIC,"I would not call this a love story.  It was an affair story.

This was not a lesbian movie.  This was a bisexual movie.

Jackie is a former child star who is known only for a science-fiction TV series that was cancelled.
She looks really young, but she is obviously at least 18.

She starts college and everyone there looks down on her for being a former actress.
She never fits in with the other students.

She immediately hears rumors about a female professor who is always having affairs with her students, mainly female students.

Jackie immediately finds out who that professor is, goes out of her way to flirt with her, and she and the professor immediately have a sexual relationship.

It almost looks like the professor took Jackie home with her and seduced her.
Jackie actually looks scared and later says that she was terrified.
But Jackie also admits to having done that kind of thing before.
And, Jackie was clearly the one who caused the affair to happen.
The professor did not seek her out, it was the other way around.
Jackie was not in any of that professor's classes, so the affair was not about Jackie using sex to get ahead in school.
It all didn't make any sense.

It is implied that Jackie had a previous affair with someone named Mark, who died, who was on the TV show with her somehow.
But it is not clear at all.

The acting is good, but the plot is weak and boring and slow, and the ending is extremely predictable.

There is no nudity.
There is kissing and implied sex.
There is no romance or passion.
It is just a sexual relationship that has no meaning or direction.
This felt like a TV movie.

SPOILER ALERT.

At one point, the professor tells Jackie that she loves her, but she says it when Jackie is asleep and cannot hear it.

The professor gets jealous that Jackie might want to go back to acting and they argue over it.

The professor says some very mean and belittling things to Jackie.

The professor has sex with some guy and makes sure that Jackie knows about it.

Jackie has sex with a guy from her dorm.

Jackie leaves college and goes back to acting.

The professor is finally formally caught having a sexual relationship with a student (Jackie) and is fired.

So, at the end, Jackie goes on to make a movie and the professor is out of a job.",1440201600,2,2283,4.4033412887828165
4435299,4,B004N21KIC,"There was potential for a great love story here, as one reviewer already mentioned. There was no nudity(Sorry guys!) The lead is a classically trained actress that conveyed her love through actions and words, rather than in the bedroom. Don't get me wrong, there's lots of provocative situations, but they are tastefully done. Then, just when you think you've stumbled upon an Indy gem, it all unravels and leaves you flat. Also,worth noting the ""Student"" is a little young for the part.
But, still  well worth the 2.99. Free for prime members. It leaves Loving Anabelle in the dust This is much better! Apparently, I'm about 5 years behind the times, there was quite a campaign for a sequel. I can see why, lots of unanswered questions here. TELL US WHAT HAPPENS!

4435301,3,B004N21KIC,"I will skip the review details of the movie as others have done much better than I could and offer the artistic choices and edits I would have made had I been the director/editor.

Spoilers ahead:

At the mixer when Catherine is coming on to Jackie, I would have had Catherine stop short of kissing her. Still get very close, but using the chemistry and sexual tension between them as a build-up. Then she invites Jackie back to her house. I would have cut away before Jackie's response-which is negated in the very next scene. Catherine asks, pause, you don't know Jackie has said yes until you see her enter the house behind Catherine.

The first sex scene is good and filled with tension/chemistry. If they indeed are waking up after a night of sex, would it have been so wrong for Jackie to sleep naked, or with something other than the tank she wore under her jacket (with her bra still obviously on)? If the actor does not want to be shown topless, you can always cut away just before the top of the sheet falls away, and show her from the back pulling down her shirt.

The airport scene was extraneous, and if Jackie was the pilot, what the hell was she doing drinking wine in the previous scene before getting behind the controls? Script supervisor was napping on the job. I understand the height difference between the leads was problematic, but the heels Jackie wears during the walk-around and presumably the flight itself? Rookie mistake. If the scene is good, the character could wear appropriate shoes and you'd probably never notice.

The bathtub scene could have been sexier had Catherine been in it with Jackie. Switch the TOD to evening, have some candles, and keep the action and the dialogue.

The scene in the library was novel (no pun intended). But it seems much too brief to portray a realistic scenario where Catherine is trying to make Jackie have an orgasm quietly. That scene had potential to start with a nice buildup, shot on a dolly, slow pan between the bookshelves, to the big finish. Instead we are treated to a mid-action? moan, followed by the bookfall interruption and the (did she finish?) finish.

Lastly, did it occur to anyone else that both characters are drinking in nearly every scene they have together? Is that the filmmakers attempt to show an adult relationship?

If the story is well-written, the dialogue realistic, and there is chemistry between the leads, you can ask the audience to suspend their disbelief when it comes to disrobing. They missed the mark by allowing Sara and Allison to keep on the same tops post-coitus they were wearing beforehand.",1439164800,,2604,4.707692307692308

Okay, student gets crush on teacher, a beautiful professor. However the romance goes out the window as the teacher swoops in on the girl/child immediately and hot kissing ensues, then it's off to bed. No tension developing, no attempt at delivering how conflicting emotions of both of the main characters causes any soul-searching.

To me, this is a gentle love story, that was doomed from the start. There are some tender moment, that will move you. Some sexy scenes that you will enjoy. The mother/daughter theme was a little confusing, to me.

The writing is very good. I liked the air plane scene, the Catherine teaching Jackie how to write her paper scene, and the library scene. I have watched a few movies, and thoes ideas were new to me. I even learned something from watching Catherine teach Jackie how to write her paper.

And there are no random side stories with stupid dialogue to take away from the main story. So often due to budget restrictions LGBT independent films are of poor quality, acting, and/or scripting. The ending sucked but the relationship was doomed from the start. I agree with one of the other reviews in that the reunion wasn't long enough to wrap it up.

4435366,5,B004N21KIC,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is incredible and you really should watch it. 0.99 is a steal for a three day rental. Before you watch it though, I feel I should give you an informed review of the movie.

First of all, like many people have been saying, the younger woman, Jackie, is physically very smaller than her teacher, Catherine. This didn't bother me really until the fireplace scene where it was very hard to ignore- just because Jackie looked as if she could have been about 15. Other than that, the movie did a very good job of hiding just how small Jackie is.

Towards the middle of the movie we come across the same trope for any romance movie- there is some kind of conflict that separates the two lovers for a certain amount of time. Some hurtful things are said by Catherine as well as Jackie and I feel like these statements were never re-visited. I felt like towards the end of the movie, nothing was really resolved. The relationship ends as quickly as it begun.

I still do feel like this movie will go in as my second favorite lesbian romance- right behind Loving Annabelle. The thing I absolutely loved about this movie is that the sexual orientation of the two leads in this movie were never the focal point of the film, and never something that was questioned or stigmatized as in some lesbian genre films I have seen.

At the end you will probably think to yourself, ""But wait, what happens next?"" Even though the ending isn't incredibly satisfying I will still give this movie 5 stars because of the believable characters, heart filled and sweet intimate scenes, and the incredible acting by the two leads. Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a forbidden love romance with a touch of humor and heart.",1359504000,5,1749,4.542857142857143

4435373,3,B004N21KIC,"This is a high quality made film.  Which is why I had such high hopes for it.  However, there was just no chemistry between the young college student (who looked liked she was in high school) and the professor.  The story takes place over a two year period but there's no evolution in plot or their relationship.  The professor has a well known reputation for sleeping with her female students without reparation; however, in the end her undoing is nothing more than a photo that shows her answering her front door with a female student standing with her back to the camera.  There was no money shot of the professor kissing or hugging the student.  In fact,  the photo was so innocuous no intelligent board of director's would have fired a teacher over it.  The student could have been selling magazines for all anyone knew.

The main problem with this movie was the poorly written script.  But, even a good director should be able to turn a poor script into believable character development.  We're supposed to believe that a professor would just walk up to a student, kiss her and say, ""let's go back to my place.""  It truly causes one to think the script was written by someone who usually writes for the porn industry.  Only they left their clothes on.  All of them.  I have nothing against a movie with no nudity, but who wakes up after a night of love making with her bra, cami and underwear still fully intact?  Was it filmed by college virgins?

The fact that the professor was very wealthy made it easy not to care that she lost her job in the end.  If she was a struggling professor, there would have been more emotion attached to the outcome.  This film should be shown to film students as a ""what not to do"" example.  They should then be asked what they would do to make it a good movie because it was close but just not there.",1354406400,2,1840,4.435820895522388

I normally don't write bad reviews simply because I usually have better things to do with my time, but in this case I hope that the people involved with the making of this film actually read some of these and are motivated to get better.

In what world would there be this ridiculously (former model) hot psych professor who is not a complete psycho interested in seducing her young students (Predatory, creepy uncle theme), and some former child star (creepy child theme) put together to make anything but a creepy unbelievable storyline? Really? What were we supposed to leave this film with?

There was no love, no seduction, no real...story. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer who commented on the cutting of the food scene...took an already creepy idea into realms one can find no words to describe.

Just awful, sadly like so many of these films are. If you want to watch a film that took real courage, had an amazing love story, and social message without being at all preachy watch Circumstance. It is amazing! And sadly in this genre all too rare.",1341792000,8,1316,4.71304347826087
4435379,4,B004N21KIC,"When beginning to watch Bloomington, I held the same skeptical optimism I typically hold when watching a Lesbian movie: hoping for it to be good, but knowing it would probably be terrible. I was pleasantly surprised when I enjoyed it very  much!

Most Lesbian movies are either overwrought, forced, or cheesy. Bloomington was not these things.

Smartly written and beautifully acted, the vulnerability and banter between Jackie and Catherine, and how complex/layered the characters and their relationship is, was compelling. Sarah Stouffer and Allison McAtee had such great chemistry and rapport- it was really authentic and convincing. So many girl on girl pairings seem contrived or corny, but this film is a cut above the rest.

I love that it portrays Lesbians just hanging out reading on the couch, forehead kisses, AND sex! We usually see just the intimate companionship, or just sex- rarely both. It's nice to see a well-rounded relationship for a change.

There are some places where scenes jump quickly, such as from their first kiss to the bedroom, and from their fight to making up. I don't feel this detracts from the story or the character development, though.

There are subtle nuances within the film, small things you should watch for, that help build the characters and the story. I think Fernanda Cardoso did a wonderful job developing the characters and their subsequent progression/regression.

I loved the ending. I found it realistic and optimistic, in the way it was left open-ended.",1336003200,3,1506,5.122448979591836
4435380,1,B004N21KIC,"The film's premise and setting hold much promise, and the two leads are very attractive, but I could barely sit through this film.  The level of dialogue doesn't go much beyond sarcastic, superficial Valley-Girl-ese.  There is no believable caring or realistic affection between the two characters.  At one point, an argument between them exposes so much contempt (especially from the older Catherine toward the younger Jackie) that the relationship could only be deemed as pathological.

The most believable film featuring an attraction between a female teacher and her student is the 1994 Australian film, ""Only the Brave."" That attraction is a secondary plot in the film, but it is potently-realized.  In Bloomington, on the other hand, the relationship is vapid & uncompelling.  Also, some major plot developments are inconsistent with prior plot information & seem haphazardly added for drama, especially Catherine's fate at the end.",1335744000,4,938,5.43448275862069

4435383,2,B004N21KIC,"I watched the previews, and my first impression was that this movie might be similar to Loving Annabelle, with a similar theme of a teacher and student falling in love with each other. I love movies set in a collegiate setting, as long as they're not of the Animal House variety, and a college film with lesbians is right up my alley, but even in the previews there was something ""off"" about the relationship. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I just didn't have a good impression about the teacher. I didn't like her, so I didn't watch the movie right away when it came out. Then I read some reviews that talked about how good it was, so I decided to give it a try. I made the unfortunate decision to purchase the movie, because it was on sale at a good price. Stupid me. Recommendation: Don't do it. Rent it if you're curious. Don't waste your money buying it. I will never watch this movie again, ever. It's that bad.

Let's start with something positive. The film quality was excellent. It's a visually striking movie, and really evokes the college atmosphere. The idea of a child TV star who grows up and goes to college is interesting and original, or could have been. It's also gratifying that the star seems to be comfortable with her sexuality. This isn't a movie about someone who is struggling with her sexual identity, so that's refreshing.

The story is really very simple, and is revealed in the previews, so I'm not really spoiling anything by writing this: Child star goes to college, meets a female teacher with whom she becomes intimately involved, then is offered a new role that threatens the ""relationship."" Instant conflict. Okay. I have no problem with that as an idea. My issue is how it was handled in this film. The two stars have no chemistry. They're both extremely attractive, but there isn't any relationship buildup, no attraction between them other than the most base form of physical attraction. The love scenes aren't satisfying, and come off as slightly creepy, because of the perceived age difference and the lack of a real connection on an emotional level (in a stark contrast to Loving Annabelle, which handled a similar plot in a much more nuanced way). I wanted to like these characters, but in the end I didn't care whether they were together, and in fact, was relieved that it didn't work out. The way the teacher felt at the party was the same way I felt watching this film -- uncomfortable.

They had a good opportunity to do something interesting with the mother/daughter relationship. It was a lot more complex than the one between the leads, or it could have been. The film doesn't really develop that part of the film much. It seems like an after-thought, and comes off one dimensional and cliched as a result. No, she's not a stage mother, as she points out. She's the mother who doesn't want to be over-shadowed by her famous daughter, but likes the money and attention she gets. There's also the subtext of the teacher as ""mother"" substitute, which could have been interesting if they worked with that theme a little. They didn't, though.

I gave this film two stars because of the production values. It's a pretty film.",1329523200,6,3173,4.630550621669627

4435385,5,B004N21KIC,"Sorry I have to break the news, but Bloomington is not a lesbian movie, but the story of two bisexual women. I'm surprise with all the reviews that haven't noticed it. Furthermore, I don't even think the lesbian director, Fernanda Cardozo, realized she made a movie for bisexuals, when her marketing machinery  labeled this as the ultimate lesbian love story.

Here are some hints:
1- Jackie, the former child star, lived with her manager Mark, until he died.
2-Catherine, the sexy professor with endless legs, mentioned she was once married.
3-Catherine had sex with a male friend after a fundraiser party.
4- Out of jealousy, Jackie had sex with a college male friend afterwards.

Let's face it: it's very unlikely that a lesbian will jump into the bed of a male friend, after an argument with her girlfriend. Maybe she will sit in front of the Tv with a gallon of ice cream, but having sex with a guy? nahhhh...

I totally agreed with some reviewers that mentioned the age difference was too great to watch. One particular scene made me realized this was just plain bad casting selection: Both are seating in Catherine's home, and Jackie looked so scared, it's almost painful to watch. Even Catherine said: ""I wish you don't be so scared "".

The problem was, Jackie looked like a 12 year old cute girl, versus the professor in her mid 30s. Disturbing.

There were some great sexy scenes, no doubt about it; obviously you can feel the actresses good chemistry. Sexy funny when Jackie started to recite her lines from her famous galactic TV show, while kissing Catherine.

My favorite scene, and the reason I watched the movie twice: Jackie is sleeping after taking Catherine to her first flying class, and the professor whispered a genuine and necessary ""I love you "".

For bisexual girls this is a great movie. For lesbians, maybe not.

I must say, I truly enjoyed it.",1325289600,11,1871,4.7323076923076925
4435386,3,B004N21KIC,"At this point everyone before has already given a synopsis of the movie so I won't waste space on that. I'm gonna hammer it down to some basic Goods and Bads. In a nutshell, if this movie stopped at mark 43:37 I would have given it 5 stars. Since it decides to take a suicide dive of character assassination, ugliness, and heavy-handed plot manipulation from then on, I give it 3.

Be warned: The Bads contain major plot points so don't read if you don't want to know about them.

The Goods:
- beautiful and talented actresses, especially in the form of one Allison McAtee. I'd never seen her in anything before but my goodness, she is ""'Da Hawtness"". Just flawless, classic beauty, with the acting chops and voice to match. I could have turned off the screen and just listened to her deliver lines. It was especially effective in the first intimate scene between Jackie and Catherine where she's taking control and leading Jackie through it. That's the stuff fantasies are made of. :)

- Casual treatment of sexuality. It's not clear whether or not either character is lesbian or bi or whatever, and we never have to have that self-discovery trek that happens sometimes. It was nice to just feel like these were two people who were attracted to each other and went with it. Done.

- Sex scenes were fantastic. I know others have written that they were disappointed with the lack of flesh and explicitness. I for one thought the way they portrayed those scenes were hot because of that reason. Some dark lighting, maybe the hint of a hand, some kissing, and you still feel the passion and it was still steamy. I wasn't looking for L-Word type shenanigans. I thought it was romantic and well-done.

- Really enjoyed the way the power dynamic was flipped on its side and reversed. You started off with Catherine being the one in charge I guess, for lack of a better way of putting it, and Jackie being the one who was sort've faltering. Catherine is a respected professor, comfortable in her life, a commanding presence who knows what she wants and gets it. Jackie is trying to find her way now that she doesn't have the one thing that has defined her for so long. She finds stability in Catherine. Suddenly, with Jackie's return to Hollywood, those roles reverse. Jackie is back in the driver's seat, taking control of her life and her career, and Catherine is left floundering without a clear sense of what to do having found herself in a position of not being in power. Great role reversal, probably best illustrated when you contrast the first bedroom scene between them with the last bedroom scene.

- Really enjoyed the general sweet romance of it.

The Bads:

- I almost didn't watch this movie because the difference between the actresses made me so uncomfortable. Allison McAtee is this statuesque gorgeous 30-something, and Sarah Stouffer is in her 20s but looks like she's all of 15, in part because of her height. It was difficult for me to get beyond that casting and not feel like I was watching something terribly wrong. I suppose maybe that was done purposefully. The actresses were good enough to be able to pull it off though, so most of the time I wasn't thinking about it after I got into the story proper.

- The incredibly quick hook-up. I get that they were physically attracted to each other, but I don't know a professor who would randomly kiss a freshman student, during a mixer, in public, outside, not knowing how the student would react. Huge risk, wouldn't you say? Limited time for filming I get, but seriously.

- The incredibly fast downhill slide at the end of the movie. For me, as for others, this was the true sticking point and the true reason I can't give this movie 5 stars. I love my happy endings for sure, and that's certainly a big reason for me not liking this ending, but I also just didn't like how incredibly out of character the interactions they had were, all in the name of progressing this portion of the plot. These are two women who care for each other. They go to each other in times of need and comfort, they snuggle on the couch and play with the dog while the other reads, they make dinner together (oh, the scene where Catherine whispers ""I love you"" to a sleeping Jackie)...they're a couple. You mean to tell me that Jackie going back to Hollywood and shifting the power dynamic of their relationship a little is all it takes for them to say nasty things to each other and go screw other people? You mean to tell me that the dissolution of their relationship doesn't even warrant a scene where they actually dissolve it, talk about it? Catherine's a freaking psychologist for Pete's Sake! Instead we just sort've understand that they haven't seen or talked to each other since their big argument, but they mysteriously bump into each other in the library and have one more reconciliation roll in the sack before they part ways again, presumably forever. What a disservice to their relationship and all that they've gone through.

- Although one of the Goods was the shifting power dynamic, did it have to be shifted to the point that it actually seems to have broken one of the characters? Jackie and Catherine both had something to gain from each other in their relationship. Jackie gained self-confidence, got herself out of her mom's house and back into the role she loves. She's waltzing off to Hollywood with barely a backwards glance. Catherine however loses her lover, loses her job, and has lost her power. We leave her a broken shell of who she once was, with no idea as to how she's going to fix herself. That was probably the most depressing part of all because I didn't feel she deserved it. Seriously, that last scene where Jackie leaves her in bed because she can't even be bothered to stay the night, she's so busy, and Catherine is left there bereft...She looks broken and beaten. Broke my heart

I own this movie, and when I watch it I watch up to the scene in which Catherine tells Jackie that she loves her. I then turn it off. That's how I chose to edit this movie and create my own ending.",1325116800,43,6068,4.572217111315547
4435387,1,B004N21KIC,"Since the marketers have drawn parallels between this film and Loving Annabelle, (which in turn is an insult to the film Meadchen in Uniform) I'll throw them both into the same bin and ask ""why is irresponsible, manipulative, co-dependent `love' considered sexy?""

Now... I totally get why *Allison McAtee* is sexy but while she is easy on the eyes, the character they've asked her to play - with her mommy issues and her complete lack of self-concept outside of her relationships with teenagers -  is downright creepy.

Both films feature professional educators acting in ways that are far from professional. Both films promote immaturity, manipulation and self-interest over maturity, sacrifice and selfless respect. But since the films feature beautiful actresses with fabulous wardrobes in lush, soft lighting --- and since one of them asks the other (oh-so sincerely) to ""say stop"" if their first sexual encounter is uncomfortable ---we're supposed to accept these relationships as ""meaningful journeys to self discovery""... or some such rot.

Having said all that, I'll partly answer my own question: I understand that the older, experienced partner guiding the young and inexperienced is a root sensual fantasy of *every* gender combination. Had this film been honest and presented itself as being nothing but a fantasy, I might have accepted it on that level. But it doesn't. It tries to tell a straightforward story and it seems to say that the issues relating to a professor/student sexual relationship and/or the issues relating to a clearly unhealthy co-dependence  aren't even important enough to bring up, let alone debate.

It's hard to see this kind of lazy filmmaking being touted as quality.",1324944000,14,1709,5.241758241758242
4435388,3,B004N21KIC,"okay the descriptions about the same. famous student goes to a school and gets mixed up with a teacher of the same sex and everyone has to live with whatever consequenses may come of it. thats where the likeness ends.
loving annabelle had a student and a teacher that had a mature love for one another. This movie is about a college professor with co dependancy issues who has a tendency of getting mixed up with the students (hey their in college, its not like its illegal, its just not cool with the schools) and a naive ex child star who tried to pull off this cool with it im not stuck on my kiddy tv show fame additude.  The kid really doesnt know what shes doing. the teacher knows exactly what shes doing. the movies more sexed up than loving annabelle but if thats what your looking for its not all that appealing anyway because you know that the kids well, stupid. Neither of them are gay though they seem to think that they are both wind up fooling around with guys just to set eachother off. im not saying i hated this movie and if i wanted to curl up on the couch and stay home one friday night with my dog and just chill ill probably watch it again but i wouldnt pay full price for it. to be honest id just stream it through amazon. thats what i did. that way i didn't feel like id lost out on money, got 3 days to watch it on my fire and practically no harm to my wallet done. its not a great movie and if your looking for a love sory of this genre id suggest loving annabelle. its got heart to it. this movie was more preditory than anything else. i was actually thinking they were gonna pull a lip service (the movie, also good) move and just beat the crap out of eachother.",1324598400,,1690,4.152439024390244
4435389,2,B004N21KIC,"I would have given this one star, but Allison McAtee's performance kicked it up one star. She gave a believable performance as the flawed college professor who violated ethical boundaries by sleeping with her students. Of course, if *I* had a college professor who looked like her, I would NEVER miss a class!

Whoever cast Sarah Stouffer as a twenty-something college student needs to have their eyes checked. SHE should have been cast in ""Loving Annabelle"" as the high school student, because she did NOT look old enough for this role and it gave the entire storyline an incestuous twist. My friends, who watched this with me, kept murmuring ""mommy issues"" during every single scene between Catherine (the professor) and Jackie (the student).

As another reviewer stated, there are NO lesbian sex scenes between Catherine and Jackie (it fades to black each time), which is actually a good thing, considering the ""mommy issues"" twist. Even though this was made by a lesbian, the two characters are NOT lesbians. There is implied heterosexual sex between Catherine and her male ""date,"" but I felt this was Catherine's way of getting back at Jackie. At a party, a male classmate of Jackie's kisses her, which was TOTALLY out of left field, and the next scene is Jackie getting dressed after having sex with the guy.

Overall, if it were not for Allison McAtee, I would say I wasted my money on this DVD. I would NEVER recommend this to my lesbian friends, because I know they would be appalled by the ""mommy issues"" twist. If the lesbian sex scenes went a bit further, I WOULD recommend it to most of my straight male friends, because I KNOW they would get off on it.

Unless you are a fan of Allison McAtee or have money to burn, do not waste it on this.",1322265600,4,1754,4.666666666666667
4435390,2,B004N21KIC,"This is just another film in a long line of films that have come out lately that tries to redefine lesbian and sexuality. The hype and build-up of the story line led me to believe this was a lesbian film. Turns out it wasn't. It was a bisexual film. Though I do not have a problem with bisexuality, I would LOVE to see a film about two women falling in love and NOT have one or both of them eventually sleep with a guy. It takes away the merit of the film, a lot like ""The Kids Are Alright."" It seems film makers are trying to redefine sexuality as a whole and portray lesbians as really bisexual and just sleeping with women until a guy comes along. It's insulting, degrading, and holds no merit. I would NOT recommend this film to anyone.

The relationship between the women was not believable. They start out just glancing at each other in an office and then before anyone knew what was going on they were in a sexual relationship. There was no pretense that Jackie had attraction to women before hand yet seemed to fall into the sexual relationship with a woman very easily. The chemistry wasn't believable either. Honestly, it creeped me out. The way the professor seemed to prey on this young woman just had an air of pedophilia. I head a lot of hype about this film on AfterEllen.com and the whole of the film just disappointed me. I would love to a lesbian film made by lesbians, starring lesbians, with a realistic feel like the webseries ""Girl/Girl Scene"" starring Tucky Williams. One day perhaps. But not while films like this one are still being made.",1320019200,4,1563,4.465034965034965
4435391,2,B004N21KIC,"This story of two bisexual - NOT lesbian - women fails to generate any romance between the two characters, and the mostly covered-up sexual encounters lack emotion, passion and sweat. The story of a university professor, Catherine, and the celebrity student she seduces, Jackie, is not only simple and the end predictable, but also lacks a foundation for understanding what the two found in each other that made it worth their jeopardizing reputations and professions. As for this film being marketed as a ""lesbian genre"" movie: what the two do in bed together may fall under the classification of homosexual, but the gears shift in a different direction the moment Catherine takes a man up to her bedroom and Jackie rolls the hay with a male student admirer. This doesn't mean that bisexuals shouldn't also be able to have their version of relationships on film; but had either one or both, instead, sought solace in the arms of another woman after the requisite breakup then it would have at least justified the ""lesbian"" category. (It does not serve any purpose to ignore that there are three branches of human sexuality: heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual.)",1319068800,2,1161,5.020725388601036
4435392,2,B004N21KIC,"I was hoping this film would succeed both because the subject needs further acceptance and because it's good to see independent film makers following their dreams.

On that note, the story lacked realism e.g. first, the opening scene where Jackie is verbally accosted because of her status and special room assignment- not likely from a dorm student manager and also when she gets the same treatment in study sessions from other students. In fact, practically all the interpersonal scenes not only rarely occur but seemed too artificially contrived to simply create tension and conflict for a movie effect. Second, the likelihood that a college prof could get away with sexual relations on numerous occasions with students nears the probability of a meteorite hitting this computer in the next thousand years. Third, even the rather quickly developing relationship was just not real especially for two highly educated people one of whom is essentially participating for the first time. Fourth, their love scene seemed to be made to pass possible censorship issues and for markability than for real romance - no chemistry. It actually seemed as if the actors were afraid to take their clothes off. Fifth and finally, the breakup scenes and reuniting scene seemed too scripted, again just to create drama in a story.

Two stars only because of Sarah Stouffer's naturalness.

I also struggled slightly with what seemed like the lightening seduction of the student. But I could forgive the ending because realistically you have two people in completely different places in their lives explaining what happens. I was slightly thrown by a few scenes that seemed incongruous. After watching the extras I realized it was because they had been inserted basically out of sequence of story events during editing. I can only guess that the editor / director liked them so much they could not leave them out despite the oddity. I thought it was amazing that this film was shot in less than 30 days, it was so well done. I think the quality of the filming rivaled many previous big budget films I have seen in the past. Despite some of the minor things I mentioned I still don't think I wasted my money and again when you factor in how quickly they shot this it goes way up in my grading scale.

There is absolutely no build up between the characters; they are virtually thrown into the sack before the second scene is over.  The actresses are attractive, but I would have expected the role of Jackie to be portrayed differently, stronger, wiser, worldly and more emotionally secure.

There Jackie meets Professor Catherine.  Their relationship is tested when Jackie decides to go for an audition and re-enters the entertainment world.

For those hoping for a naughty teacher/student romp, be warned that this is rather tame in the hanky-panky department.  Heck, they show a lot worse in PG-13 romantic comedies at multi-plex matinee shows.

In this case the featured couple is female, one a college student and one a professor.  The student is a semi-famous ex-starlet, having had a well received run on a sci-fi television series now in syndication. The professor is beautiful and wealthy, with a predatory reputation.

Sure enough, the professor swoops down very early in the movie, but this first part is more romantic and sweet than sordid, even given the forbidden nature of the liaison.  At the end of the first half, you'll be wondering what happened to the fierce predator, as the professor tenderly nurtures her young chick, taking her completely under her wing.  Regardless, this is the best part of the movie, with great acting and palpable chemistry between the two.

Other than that the student has a less than perfect relationship with her mother (and therefore may be looking for a substitute) and that the professor inherited a fortune (and is lonely), there isn't any more back-story or character development, so when the movie heads downhill in the second half, you're left wondering what the heck happened.

The material was there for a good romantic drama with a better resolved ending, but the filmmakers wrapped it up far too abruptly, leaving this viewer feeling short changed when the credits started rolling.

The shot choice was excellent, the dialogue was not only convincing but touching and the music was great. My only criticism would be that it seemed to end far too soon. This is probably due to the open ended ending.

The way in which each scene is composed doesn't try to hit the viewer on the head with the conflict, but it hits home enough with tidbits of dialogue so that it really goes to the heart of the piece. Two people,  who are so obviously different in what we learn about their upbringing and the interactions between Jackie and her mother, are both in a world much their own. This is what I feel drew me into this film. I like that the focus wasn't really on how dramatic their lives were because of their relationship but it was more on how two people can know each other and still misunderstand one another.

In a nutshell this film was beautiful, painful and well worth a rental. I'd give it a four out of five because I think the ending could use some work, but I wouldn't let that stop you from watching it.",1310169600,2,1106,4.232227488151659
4435401,4,B004N21KIC,"SUMMARY :

Jackie is an (ex)/has been child star, who decides to go to University in Bloomington instead of California. Of course, people recognize her some like her, some don't, others just don't care. However, all those people's opinions could matter less once she meets Catherine. Catherine is a Psych professor in the University and there are SO many rumors surrounding her, people find her for some reason intimidating and advice Jackie to stay away from her. Jackie in response feels curious about this ""woman"" but she doesn't say anything until Catherine approaches her and BAM you guessed it they embark an affair.

MY OPINION :

Well, For a lesbian movie and a Teacher/student one at that, a person would assume a LOT of things that things being lots of Hot sex scenes, lots of drama, the danger of being caught, the (Taboo) of the relationship and of course a Happy Ending.

In this film, you get a good acting and the plot actually made sense. It was also realistic and Romantic Somewhat without being cheesy or over the top. Both Jackie and Catherine were mature, and handled their relationship as adults not as whiny teenagers which is Good.

So why 3.5 stars instead of 5 ? It's not the movie's fault, but I guess I'm a very Romantic person I can't help it. This movie was so Realistic for me, I didn't get my Disney Happy Ending and I was disappointed a LOT because of that. I wanted the characters to fight for their right to be together, I wanted them to come up with a solution. I wanted them to show passion and great love for each other, greater than anything else in life. I wanted them to put their love first and all the rest of the things to fall behind it. The Other problem I found in this movie, though not as a big deal as the first is the sex/love scenes. You would expect them to be Hot ? Sexy ? But they felt, more like cuddling to me. When the lead actresses were having sex, I never believed it was sex. There was hardly any nudity to make me believe that.

Overall, Good Movie and like what I said the acting was great and the plot was good too if not for those two flaws I mentioned above I would rate this a 5. It's still good to watch though. I would give it a rent :)",1309737600,,2205,4.326876513317191

4435403,3,B004N21KIC,"OK so I decided to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews on here. Ya know, go into this with an open mind, take a wait-and-see approach. And I'm glad I did because here are my two cents for what it's worth.

The movie had the ingredients to be something better but I think time constraints prevented it from getting there. The characters didn't have time to fully develop. For starters we don't really know why Catherine Stark is the way she is other than she's lonely. Ok, so why does she sleep with students? Why does she have such a predatory nature about her? Why do students fear her? These questions weren't really answered unless I blinked and missed it? And Jackie, well her character was all sorts of twisted. There were times when I found myself saying ""wow what a spoiled brat."" I couldn't find myself relating to her in any which way. In fact, I actually preferred seeing Catherine on the screen. Her character seemed much more relateable to me. There were some moments when I could sense her vulnerability.

I most certainly did not like the second half of the film. Everything stopped making sense and the two of them at odds didn't seem or feel real. Then the way they quickly made up one last time at the end seemed out of place. I attribute that to time constraints. Had they had maybe 7 more minutes to make this movie at an even hour and 30 minutes then perhaps they could have made the ending better or more credible. I didn't like the ending one bit.

All in all, I think Catherine's presence on screen saved the movie for me from giving it 1 star. She carried the movie in my humble opinion or at least she should have. I would like to see her in future films.

For those debating whether to watch this: just do it. Don't watch it expecting Oscar worthy material or soap opera stuff. Just watch it with an open mind.",1307836800,,1850,4.400584795321637
4435404,2,B004N21KIC,"I read the reviews, prior to renting this movie.  Most reviews had the usual complaints of dialogue and sets, but no one talked about the actors, or the story line.
I was hesitant, but thought that unlike ""Loving Annabelle"", this would be a bit more ""adult"", given the setting was a college and not a high school. Wrong!  The actress who portrayed ""Jackie"" looked like she was 12, but supposed to be more like 20.  That was a bit creepy. I can think of a number of early 20 somethings who would look more like they were 20, and not a 12 year old.
Also, the character of Catherine was just plain predatory.  While college professors are teaching adults, and therefore, it's consensual, the character was on the hunt, and then acted like a 16 year old once they had hooked up.
I agree with previous reviews that the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and was, quite frankly, unrealistic.  If you've ever set foot on a college campus, and have spent any time talking/socializing with the staff, the idea that 1) this professor could hook up with freshmen semester after semester without any problems was a bit much and then, 2) when she is ""caught"", she is dismissed.  Really?  What century is this?

I always appreciate it when the effort is made to create lesbian-themed films. I buy them at pre-release to support the effort and when they're good, like Nicole Conn's ""Elena Undone"", I tell everyone who will listen to see it.

This movie, sadly, is just not good.

The student female lead appears to be about 12 (okay, 12 is an exaggeration but young, really, really young) and the professor female lead appears to be (depending on the camera angle) over 30. The professor is unlikeable throughout the whole film because their inappropriate relationship is based on power/seduction and not courtship-then-love. I didn't think there was any chemistry between the two leads and in one scene, when the professor leans over and cuts the food on the student's plate, it was way too parental and not personal/intimate (which I'm hoping was the director's goal).  I thought the ""bed scenes"" were awful - not that I care to see lots of flesh, but during supposedly intimate encounters, neither woman removed their clothing.

I suppose any lesbian movie is better than none.  I look forward to the day when there are so many viewing options; the market drives the makers to provide a better product.  Until then, this stinko film is one of a very few current films available. Poop.",1305849600,41,1310,4.795555555555556
4435410,3,B004N21KIC,"I saw the behind the scenes videos online and apparently the movie was shot in 4 weeks.  Due to the budget, luckily they used the producers parents house, hence the huge mansion.  This movie definitely was good, but it could have been better. I think if they had a bigger budget, the storyline could've expanded more.  In the beginning I found Catherine to be a little creepy, but it was hot creepy you know?  Amazing job on the sex scenes, I could really feel their passion.  When it got towards the ending, the whole excitement of the movie sorta went downhill and they left the ended open ended.  I hope that they decide to make a sequel though cause I'd be interested in watching that.  So for a movie that was only shot in 4 weeks, it's worth watching and buying.",1305244800,9,768,4.404255319148936

8436393,5,B004N21KIC,"Compared to other lesbian movies, many of which are geared toward hating normal men, heterosexual women and anyone not strongly supporting alternative lifestyles, this movie is great.  The acting for some of the secondary roles isn't perfect, but good enough that it doesn't take away from the movie.  As for audience impact:  This is one of the best movies that I've ever watched; although I must admit that when I watched it I was at a cross-roads.  I could relate to McAtee's character, as someone going through normal life changes.",1521504000,,535,4.911111111111111

It feels like it had a better budget than some flicks floating around and its not some gratuitous sex thing, it is an actual movie and chances are you won't hate it. Its not happy or unhappy really, just a story.",1496188800,,522,4.077669902912621
8436397,4,B004N21KIC,"Not your average bad acting, lesbian, soft porn movie. I gave the movie itself three stars and a whole star for Allison McAtee with her beauty and those heart melting dimples. The movie had good and bad to it. The ending was definitely disappointing and derailed so quickly. I wish it went more into background of the actresses. Opposite attraction at its finest with the cast, but it sort of worked. Definitely in my top 5 of lesbian movies and trust me, not a lot of decent ones iut there.",1490572800,,491,4.466666666666667

8436400,1,B004N21KIC,"What I've noticed about way too many reviews of Bloomington is that they are either four or five star reviews or one or two star reviews which would  strongly suggest that the four and five star reviews are trolls  reviewing on behalf of the film's  Producer/director.

 If you  read the majority  of all the  four and five star reviews,  their summations in bold  say ""good movie"", ""loved it"", ""great movie"",  etc.  The one star, two star and some of the three star reviews express their summations  consistently saying ""very disappointing"" and the like,  are very accurate in their perception of the nature and intentions of this movie  which seems to be nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  First of all,  Four star and five star reviews basically say all the same things, i.,e., ""The main characters are very beautiful and the chemistry between them is so realistic and heartwarming and their struggles  are relatable. This is a great ""lesbian"" movie""  .  .  .  And so on. Reviews are  deliberately very general in nature,  essentially speaking.  Also,  many viewers were left wondering whether the  sexual  interactions between the teacher and a man and the student and a man were simply acts of vindictiveness or suggest the possibility of bisexuality.  This is very heavy handed

However the one star, two star and some of the three star reviews are very specific in what they find unlikable and offensive about Bloomington.  I agree totally with the one star and two star reviews. These are not trolls. They are honestly giving their heartfelt opinions regarding how creepy, inconsistent and  under developed the characters are and how unrealistic  it is that these two so quickly got together  and supposedly  develop a loving  (more  than  sexual) relationship. However, the teacher whose  academic  specialty is abnormal psychology acts more like a child than the student she is supposedly in love with. The way she responds to her young lover's choice to go back to Hollywood to do a feature-length film  is an absurd display  of jealousy , vindictiveness, immaturity and blatently reactive and cruel.  I disgree with those reviewer's who suggest that the teacher is around 30. My perception is that she is 35 to 40. She should go back to college and study abnormal psychology again. The teachers behavior makes no sense whatsoever  and for that reason made me angry at the director for making such a stupid choice in the script .  Cassandra was an editor only until Bloomington which she both directed and edited  This is why very few editors move on to be directors -at least good directors.  An editors' role in a movie is to connect/  merge  the scenes together in creative and innovative ways that  are in concert with the message  and tone of the movie they have been hired to edit.

Cassandra should stick to editing and stay away from directing as this film does nothing for the lesbian cause because it is so shallow,  with an unbelievable and  overly contrived plotline.

 It is so far below the quality of Loving Annabelle  that it almost goes without saying.  There are parts that I did not like about Loving  Annabelle but at least the relationship was believable and the eye contact and nuanced demeanor and feelings were incredibly profound. Despite the fact that it involved a teacher around 40 years old and underage girl/student,  -  which brings into question the morality of the relationship  Annabelle was less than one year away from being 18 years old so technically what difference does it make?  Also, Mother Superior, it was strongly suggested, had sexual relations with the teacher making her decision to have her  niece arrested for pedophilia very unrealistic. It would've been something that would've been kept ""quiet"". But if being arrested is part of the script  being unchangeable, rather than being arrested for pedophilia ( which was ridiculous in itself), statutory rape was the appropriate charge,  it also would've been difficult to make any charge stick because the student did everything she could to seduce the teacher despite the teacher's saying many times ""no no no!""  The teacher and the student in Loving Annabelle were truly in love  and  the movie  brought this across in the touching and realistic love scenes and other scenes and in such a tearjerking manner.

Bloomington can't even compare to movies like  Loving Annabel, Elena  Undone,  Only the Brave, All about E, even Of girls and Horses  which many people like didn't like because it was so subtle and nuanced and symbolic  in attempting to relate  how it feels to feel free being  Lesbian.

Don't let the 4 star and 5 star reviews by the trolls fool you. They are an injustice to  and undermine the open review process.",1479859200,,4744,4.875314861460957
