1443705,5,B00005JLF2,"This was one of the best shows to ever be called ""edge of your seat entertainment."" That description was, at times, almost literal. Kiefer Sutherland was fantastic, clearly deserving of his Golden Globe win, and he was backed by a superb supporting cast. This was one show that I made it a point to go out of my way to watch every new episode. It hooked me from the start, and didn't let me go until the bang-up ending. And what an ending it was! ""24"" is a prime example of the type of quality programming television is capable of, if only the networks have the guts to take the risk.",1022112000,,584,4.27027027027027
1443706,5,B00005JLF2,"I am totally hooked on 24 it is amazing. It isn't a straight forward good vs bad there are lots of sub plots, that keep you guessing on who the bad guy is in CTU. Kiefer Sutherland is excellent as Jack Baur he pulls the part off as if it were really happening to him, there is an amazing supporting cast as well. Although in the UK it is only dinner time, i challenge anyone to watch one episode and not get hooked. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD in the UK, as i will certainly be ordering it ASAP",1022112000,7,505,3.8653846153846154
1443707,5,B00005JLF2,"I have seen all 24 hours worth of this series and I was blow away but how this series was pulled off. This is truely a very intense drama with Excellent plot twists.
I'm sure this DVD will be well worth it!",1021680000,2,206,3.9285714285714284
1443708,2,B00005JLF2,"Pretty disapointing. The video is a compilation of two previously released documentaries. The first part is a rather crude ""home movie"" of the 100th mission flown by the 44th Bomb group. The film was shot not by official combat photographers but apparently by members of the group themselves,and assembled by the Group's Photo Officer. There is some narration by Col. Leon Johnson,who was with the Group at the time and had earlier won the Medal Of Honor for his part in the first Ploesti mission. Interesting for B-24 fans. The second,and longest,part of the video is an official Army Air forces film titled""Report From The Aleutians"".Familiar to most World War Two video collectors,it depicts the activities of U.S. aviation on Adak. Filmed in Technicolor,this print is rather murky. B-24 footage is somewhat incidental,but there are good scenes of P-38 Lightning,P-39 Airacobra,and P-40 Warhawk operations as well. I can only reccomend this video if you are particularly interested in the subject matter.",1011830400,2,1007,5.260869565217392
1443753,2,B00005JLF2,"The first few episodes were intriguing and enjoyable. However, it quickly went downhill as it became apparent that they were introducing and piling on one foolish event after another needlessly. To be honest, if it weren't for the wives and the children in the show it could have ended in less than half the length. But they dragged it out far too long pointlessly and ruined the show for me. I wanted to see the ending so skipped the last few episodes and most of the parts involving the wives and kids. That did not ruin the ending for me at all and I was quite happy with it since I had no sympathy for that character whatsoever. Maybe I am heartless, but I would argue it had more to do with the fact that that particular character was simply annoying and highly unrealistic.",1514592000,,779,4.416666666666667
1443754,2,B00005JLF2,It was pretty good up until the third episode in season one. I do not appreciate 2 women kissing so I quit!,1514246400,,107,3.909090909090909
1443755,5,B00005JLF2,"BEST SHOW EVER!! Could not stop watching, binging! All seasons are great. Except of Live another Day when Jack Bauer is no longer in the show.",1512000000,,142,4.5
1443756,5,B00005JLF2,I just finished watching season 1 of 8. It should have been 5.1 surround but it wasn't. I hope season 2 is 5.1. The picture is 16:9 so that compensates for the audio. The story is interesting. The action and violence is adequate. I watched six episodes today and the last four were after supper. I finished about twenty minutes before bedtime. Amazon Prime recommended this in an email one day and I will have seven more seasons at my disposal.,1510012800,,444,4.493827160493828
1443757,2,B00005JLF2,"Love the series, but this DVD keeps stalling and blanking out.",1509753600,,62,4.7272727272727275
1443758,2,B00005JLF2,"I've heard so many rave reviews of this series that I decided to give it a try. The first few episodes were gripping, but when I figured out that the writers were going to drag out the plot for 24 episodes, I gave up. I need some kind of positive resolution to keep me watching when there are so many bad things happening at once. I kept going back to try, but eventually gave up. These stories would be fine for a movie, but dragging them out for so long forces the writers to introduce so many plot errors it detracts from the overall plot. Example: In Season 1, when the imposter father of Janet kills her, I wanted to scream, ""NO NO NO! There's no way anyone could get away with smothering someone in intensive care who is hooked up to all those machines! That did it for me!",1509321600,,779,4.2

1443805,2,B00005JLF2,Took too long. Made it to season 1 episode 5 and i cant take no more.,1503360000,,69,3.375
1443806,2,B00005JLF2,"I watched the first 23 episodes of the TV series 24 and gave up half way through episode 24. Why you might ask?
This was a wildly popular show, starting in 2001, it ran through 2010, then came back in 2014 with another season and a spin off in 2017.
It won several awards for acting and even best dramatic series. So this must be a terrific show right? What's not to like?
Well, I can say the acting is top notch, the camera work and sets are well done. The format of a real time story line is fascinating and really draws you in.

Okay, the plot line is ridiculous. So much happens in 24 hours, so many rules are broken with no consequences, the bad guys have such pervasive information and connections, the star has endless energy.

I can accept all of that. What I can't accept is this.

Every female in the first season is a fool or a hypocrite or a traitor, a killer, a temptress, a manipulator or a heartless fiend of some sort.
It's too much. Why didn't anyone notice this? If you don't believe me, think about the characters in season one and what happened. Every woman is seriously flawed.

I can provide details if anyone is interested, but for this post I'm avoiding the spoilers in case anyone is like me and watching TV that's 16 years old for the first time.

In that case, my advice is to skip 24.",1503360000,,1312,4.253012048192771

1443809,4,B00005JLF2,"The best thing about reviewing '24' is that you only need to review one season. Literally, every season is exactly the same.

Corrupt President? Check.
Bad guy inside CTU? Check.
Imminent danger to the Country? Check.

Every season is exactly the same. Entertaining? Absolutely. Original? Don't bet on it. It's a miracle it went on for 8 seasons. I recommend it.

Video quality is great, 1.78.1 Anamorphic. Special features are worth watching also. The ONLY bad thing is that I'm giving Fox money to fund their State-Run Media Network, Fox News.

I should also mention that every now and then, they insert 'conservative' ideas/comments. Thankfully it's usually a one-liner or Fox News playing on the TV. It's also funny they have a version of ""CNN"" that is only watched by Terrorists and bad guys. I had to roll my eyes at that one as I'm not easily fooled by brainwashing. Seriously, watch for it.

To end -- buy it, watch it, enjoy it.",1500681600,2,937,4.723926380368098

The bad guys seem to have a budget greater than feds--nobody wastes taxpayer money like the fed.gov.
Technology is poorly understood and developed.

Too many stupid things happen throughout the story lines. I will continue to watch to see if it improves, but only because it is free with Amazon Prime and will update accordingly.

Update - does not get any better. One stupid decision after the next from every character. Plus this concept does not work as everything is dragged out in order for them to have 24 episodes so each episode has so much useless story details.",1484611200,,561,4.5

I was not a fan of his early work, so didn't start watching with any great expectations.  However, he makes the show and am now on the second time through watching the 8 seasons and movie of 24.  Appreciate that the language does not have much profanity with the exception of the ""dammit"" that is always appropriately expressed.  His character is a true patriot and selfless and dedicated agent.",1484092800,,523,4.714285714285714

  This could have been a good story - but the writer is terrible - made no effort for the events to make sense. So many say ""their six year old could have done better.
  The Daughter - clearly playing a 'simple minded fool' is an character that should have ENDED in this series along with the Mother. And when, in a few scenes, the going got tough - can merely request to ""talk to my Father"" and She is accommodated.
Well lets see: everyone knows 'anyone' can walk around a crime scene; be told the facts of an investigation and walk around freely in an highly secure facility right?!
  Oh.....that bullet proof car....can simply be accessed with a baseball bat or the butt of an rifle???????????
The agents.... a few have nothing to do but watch each other - I guess that is the way it is at Homeland Security and other anti-crime units.

1447086,2,B00005JLF2,"The repetitive hero tropes in this show are unbearable (decent locations and action sequences raised the 1-star to 2-stars).

If you care that women are positively portrayed in TV shows, don't watch this show.  The ""wife"" and ""daughter"" only exist as plot objects to be vulnerable, protected and rescued, over and over. Therefore, they repeatedly endanger themselves so the hero has more opportunities to be heroic.
Furthermore, the Presidential candidate is a plot object that exists only to provide a target for the Villains.
Casting him as a black Senator perhaps makes him more vulnerable to be protected by the Caucasian hero?

It's embarrassing that white guys were still writing this dreck in 2002.

The storyline comes straight out of an online writer's handbook.
Really. Google this: ""Villains Act, Heroes React""  tvtropes.org
It completely describes this TV show.  Compare these two plot excerpts to the handbook  excerpts after them.

====  The Plot
Villains have a plan to kill the first black US Presidential Candidate. They kidnap the wife+daughter (W+D) of US Counter Terrorism Agent Jack Bauer to force him to assassinate the Senator.  Jack's reaction is that he is the only person who can thwart their attack and rescue his wife+daughter (W+D).  Meanwhile, Jamie, the steely single-mother Latina, and computer network expert is revealed to be a traitor. However, once she's caught. She summarily kills herself with a coffee mug.  Jack finally triumphs in saving the Senator, killing the main Villain and rescuing his family.
Then, duty once again calls him away from his family.

Villains invoke plan B to kill Senator. W+D are kidnapped again. Almost every subvillain is killed by Jack's own team so Jack must then become even more heroic to rescue his family and capture the masterminds behind the assassination plot.

Fellow agent Nina, the sultry slender brunette provides steadfast support of Jack's heroics. This substantiates her (anticipated) future reveal as a double agent.

==== The Handbook excerpts
""Villains Act, Heroes React
If somebody has a plan at the start of the story, that character is probably a villain....Most heroes are protectors of some kind (cops, doctors (in medical dramas), or the parents of children who are being threatened by some (possibly supernatural) evil),

Vasquez Always Dies
When two Action Girls are featured in the same film, frequently the tougher, more aggressive and less feminine character will die, despite being better equipped for the situation at hand...One of the reasons is the belief that the femininity and sex appeal of a female character determines their usefulness as Love Interest or Fanservice or, in the most insulting cases, their reason to be in the story at all...  It's easier for an audience to feel fear if the Final Girl is less battle savvy and thus more vulnerable - a hardened Vasquez left alone wouldn't be as terrifying....
Writers will sometimes compensate by making the more attractive woman some sort of mysterious secret agent...""",1483056000,,3026,5.193415637860082

Used to have to record them and then do the FF thing endlessly.  So it is nice now to be able to go back in time and watch the beginning of the series without all the hassle.  The original is just as good as the recently released new season.,1481846400,,383,4.135135135135135

How many times should a person think he is going to die in one 24 hour period?

Having finished season 1, I think I am unlikely to watch another season.",1479168000,,413,3.9518072289156625

Because Kiefer Sutherland is in a new series and I think he's a very good actor I thought I would go back and start watching '24' - I am just a few episodes into the first season but if I had time I would not stop until I watched every episode.

This show created a new kind of TV drama, there had never been any show in ""real time"" to my knowledge before this one and I did hang on ever second. That little clock ticking down the time just heightened the suspense. The plot(s), the characters, the actors were are so spot on.

1450269,4,B00005JLF2,"I'm enjoying this show though the idea of showing each hour is somewhat trivial and obviously fills some time. My biggest observation is the fact that the writers have the characters make stupid decisions on what course of action they should take next at the resolution of an immediate problem and of course this gives the writers new situations to deal with and draws things out. While it all works out in the end, it seem silly to see the characters come to some courses of action based upon irrational thinking without any perception to ramifications.",1477612800,,554,4.78125

This may not be the fairest review because previous to watching this, I binge watched ""How to Commit Murder"" ""Revenge"", ""Scandal"" ""Madam Secretary"" ""Scandal"" so I was in a vein.  This isn't that type of show.  It's more of a one man thing and not as riveting as I had hoped it would be.

1450712,4,B00005JLF2,"Season one started off fine... then more and more... and more violence. Season 2 is even worse. Deteriorated to 3 ... maybe 2 stars. Jury's out. I enjoyed Blue Blood-- which also got more violent as the seasons wore on, but there was a balance of the show always pointing back to a conscientious commitment to explore the dark side through the lens of ""The Sunday Dinner."" This show, 24, makes no such effort. And it seems to me it's just one more show that is deadening our population to moral and ethical atrocities that were not a part of everyday living 30 years ago. As we began to see the rise in violence on television in the early 1980's, we started down a slippery and dangerous slope. I wish that 24 would have found another way to create an ""on the edge of one's seat"" suspense without the ceaseless violence.",1476921600,,820,4.437086092715232

1450837,1,B00005JLF2,"Watched the first 17 episodes, finally gave up in disgust for having watched the plot drawn out for so long. Jack Bauer calls it the longest day of his life...I can relate watching the first season, seems like the longest day of my life too! Does no one not get tired after being up for 2 days and 1 night? All of the character's persona created by the writers, are just not believable. One man out to save the word with the aid of a few flunkies who sit in the office and answer Jack's phone calls? How many times can Jack keep asking his wife and daughter if they are ok? Enough already! Can Jack's wife and daughter get a better script? The daughter goes over the edge of a steep canyon and emerges with her full faculties, but the mom just faints and gets amnesia as a result? really? I found the series ""Black List"" to far more entertaining than this soap opera charade.",1476748800,2,875,4.27710843373494

This is the best, smartest, most innovative action/intrigue show I have ever seen. It has covert-agent action-intrigue, national-level political intrigue, office politics, family politics, intense action (not crappy ""tv"" quality at all! But motion picture quality), taut, intense drama, and  astounding twists. A season is 24 hour-long episodes. The 24 episodes represent 24 hours in a day. So, a season is events that happen in a day. It works because it gives tbe writers astounding room to flesh out the intimate aspects of a story. In most other tv shows, things are resolved in an hour. This takes 24 hours. We have been binge-watching and are half way through season 2. And, going back for more tonight.",1474416000,,819,4.85

1452435,3,B00005JLF2,I think the program is in overdrive from the perspective of a constant crisis.  The main character cannot seem to resolve any issue thoroughly for someone who is supposed to be a top counterintelligence agent.

1452971,3,B00005JLF2,"The series is well-acted, filmed well, and has constant tense action.  It's only real failing is the writing--the story is entirely too dependent on characters making stupid decisions that place them in danger.  The hero tells someone to stay just where they are, and of course they get up and leave.  Or, instead of escaping to a busy street where they can ask for help, they instead run down a blind alley.  These plot devices are annoying, and they are so frequent it spoils the flow of the show.  We keep watching, because the story and acting are rather addictive, but we can't watch more than two or three episodes at a time without become antsy because of the stupid plot twists.  For lack of anything better, we have started watching season 2, and already the stupid decisions are proliferating.",1473811200,,803,4.7

1453910,5,B00005JLF2,I was hooked on this show from episode 1. There is a lot of action and watching Jack Bauer do what he does made me tired. laughing,1473120000,,130,3.8518518518518516
1453911,2,B00005JLF2,"I have heard many positive things about the show when it was on the air, but I never got around to watching it.  When I recently discovered that I could watch it for free as part of the Prime membership, I thought I'd give it a try.
Maybe it's that I'm watching it 15 years after it aired.  Maybe it's that it uses editing and technology that have long since been used in other shows and surpassed.  But I just couldn't stick with it for a long run.  I got to the second season, which felt like a chore at times.  I fell asleep during one of the episodes (don't remember which one), and never bothered picking it back up.
There are too many contrivances for my taste, and too much ""show for show's sake"", in my opinion.  And I really do *not* like all the political scheming and back-stabbing, not just among the politicians, but among all the characters.  In the first season and change, no character seemed to like any other character, and they only worked together because some circumstance forced them to.  While situations like this may be true in Hollywood, they are not the case everywhere else.",1473120000,4,1102,4.447761194029851

1454138,3,B00005JLF2,"I really liked the show.  It was addictive for the first two or three seasons.  Not so much for the rest.  What I DISLIKED INTENSELY, were the ""Trivia"" and ""Goof"" notes on the side.  Don't know who provides those, but they are superfluous at best......and distracting and annoying at worst.  We all have seen wardrobe/hairstyle changes, etc. in one frame to the next, or a microphone hanging into the top of the picture.  To call attention to it, is small-minded and means someone doesn't have enough productive things to do.",1472860800,,525,4.777777777777778

We were enjoying the story, the acting and the excitement until we had watched two thirds of Season 1. It was then that the politics of  the screen writers for this series became evident. The series was enjoyable until they decided to make the good guys and the Presidential Candidate - Democrats. Well now you have ruined it for us. We no longer look forward to watching because we now know this series is an attempt by the left wing, big money, political machine to indoctrinate us and force their views on us. We will never know how any of the issues were resolved because we now are finished watching . We will not be watching this political fairy tale anymore.

1455358,3,B00005JLF2,"""24"" is a fantasy built on a misconception born of the great lie to explain why the Bush Administration resorted to torture in dealing with terrorism.  The great lie was, and is, that torturing a suspect to get information about an imminent terrorist threat will produce reliable information.  Having been close to the intelligence community, I know for certain that it doesn't work that way, never did and never will. However, having said that, it's also fair to say that ""24"" is a well-produced entertainment even though it over-indulges plausibility.

For example, when the daughter is in the barn she has brown sandals on, a few moments later she has on pink loafers. Then back to brown sandals in the next scene. The size of the burn on her hand depends on who was doing make up that day. Changes frequently. Some people get killed. It is amazing that no one got any blood on them when they hid the blood soaked body. In the helicopter the wig on one of the characters is not only fake looking, it is also the wrong color. I can't believe that this and many more mistakes got by the editors.

We binged during the Summer of 2013. Until Breaking Bad I could not find anything exciting, I didn't watch BB either until it was done, I didn't get the meaning of the title. A bad was to prejudge a series, yes! Oh and Walt in his undies, another thing I prejudged.
So I'm ready for a leisurely revisit to 24. Aside from Nina and Terry, I love the concept, I could suspend my beliefs, it can happen, Its Jack! I think it so defines Sutherland as an amazing actor. Seeing him do an interview is freaky, he' is so not Jack.",1469232000,,673,3.9925925925925925

This past week I've been down with a severe sinus attack so it seemed a good time to check out ""24"".  WOW!!  Non-stop action and intrigue, just the way I like it.  I'm not a big fan of gratuitous violence and many so-called intrigue shows have a lot of that but ""24"" doesn't.  Oh, it has its share of violence, some of which was new to me, but at least it made sense to the story.  I admit I was a tad perturbed at some of the stupid choices a few of the characters made that put them in harms way, but it's easy to armchair those situations. Ditto the fact that there's a lot of rogue activity in the agency which immediately puts a business owner on edge because of the gaps in protocol, but overall, it's a great series.  I've watched 54 episodes already and unless they get too political, I'll probably go the distance with this one.  (It's a pet peeve of mine when producers rewrite history to suit their programming.) I must say, before this series the only exposure I had to Kiefer Sutherland was his character in ""A Few Good Men"".  He's terrific in this series, as are the other regs.

1459301,4,B00005JLF2,"""Twenty-Four"" is excellent and worthy of 5 stars. The writing is outstanding and keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat.  However, the streaming is horrible. I binged watched 3-4 episodes at a  time.  Approximately every 25 minutes, the audio stops altogether or pauses while the video continues.  So every 25 minutes or so, I have to turn off then turn on the Smart TV, return to Amazon Prime, wait for the TV to reconfigure (or ""prepare the television""), then continue watching.  I have a Samsung, so perhaps this problem will not occur with a different brand (although it doesn't happen when watching Netflix).",1466121600,,619,4.857142857142857

Our feature character, Jack Bauer, is an incredibly resourceful and dedicated government agent (CTU).  This series is wonderfully cast with Jack, members of CTU, President Palmer and his wife.  I thought that Penny Johnson Jerald was spectacular and was so convincing as the highly motivated politician's wife.
  The series are one hour snippets within one day - they pack in more action in one hour than I have all day long and that is how I like it.

It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I am not sure I will spend the time (1,008 minutes, at 24 episodes x 42 minutes per) to watch season two.

All dramatic movies and television shows require what is called ""suspension of disbelief,"" that is, that something improbable could actually be possible. But the twists late in this season went beyond my capacity to suspend disbelief, and I wound up feeling cheated. Still, four stars for a very interesting, novel concept, with good acting, and good writing until near the end. Perhaps they should have hired me on as a consultant to rein them in a little at the end...",1465257600,,970,4.773809523809524

1462217,3,B00005JLF2,"I enjoyed the premise, delivery and execution of most of the plot lines, but I had serious issues with the Bauer ladies character choices and decisions, which carried enough weight for two stars IMO.

For example (some mild plot spoiler incoming) in one scene as the ladies are making an escape in a motor vehicle, they think they lost the pursuer by turning off the main road, onto a small dirt road. They come to a stop and the mother gets out of the vehicle to check if they lost the pursuers, setting up the next plot development.

She. Gets. Out. Of. The. Vehicle.
Seriously! If there was a contest of worst decisions made by tv characters in all of time, this one would be the defending champion for eternity.

I don't know if it was intentional, but in general it seems that all ladies of the show were designed to be mind numbingly stupid. It hurt my head. I realize this was kinda the way they were portrayed 15 years ago, but it was really bad writing and I can't believe some of it actually aired.",1463875200,4,1008,4.379679144385027

1463163,5,B00005JLF2,It is rare that I give any show 5 stars but 24 is one of the best television shows that has aired. At least in my opinion.  Each episode has several plot lines to follow but the show keeps the viewer engaged with tense plot lines. It is best to view from the beginning as there is a running story.,1463184000,,297,3.95

1463510,1,B00005JLF2,"All I ever heard from people was how this show was so awesome.  I guess I missed the boat on this one.  I tried watching the first season, and I kept telling myself that it must get better, but after episode 17 I had to give up.  The characters did nothing, except make one stupid decision after another just for the sake of trying to keep the plot going.  The show is full of bad actors which I'm sure get killed off within the first few seasons, but it wasn't soon enough for me.  Jack's wife, Teri was the worst of the bunch.  Plenty of fake crying, but not one tear to be seen.  The lack of realism in the show is what completely ruined it for me.  The only thing that got me to the 17th episode was how funny and unbelievable things got.  I never liked soap operas, but this was a soap opera which was made for prime time.  After the wife got *Spoiler Alert* amnesia, that was the final straw.  Jack kept saying at the beginning of the episode that this was the longest day of his life...well...me too, buddy...me too.",1463097600,2,1023,4.194871794871795

To my knowledge, no other regular TV show before or since has ever tried that. Throw in a lot of action, great writers and a stellar cast led by Keifer Sutherland and you have a classic!

It puts things in perspective compared to other shows. So your daughter is being kidnapped  you must save the presidential candidate handle an internal problem in your unit and still keep your marriage growing not to mention keep your sanity while doing all of these things that you don't know are related to the same thing you're trying to avoid.

The nailbiting scenarios presented in 24 were nothing short of hair raising. For many viewers, the question to contemplate was; could these events really be occurring secretly in society? Were the scenarios featured be taken from actual clandestine operations undertaken by US counterinsurgency agencies?

1468669,3,B00005JLF2,"The overall acting is really good, the inconsistency in the daughter and the mother's personality and acting really bothers me though.  It's like she went from being an angsty rebellious teenager to being a very calm, problem-solving oriented analytical/manipulative person, to being a very soft incapable whiny girl to once again being an angsty rebellious teenager - didn't currently finish the whole season but I wanted to get that off my back.  The mom's acting is also very.... okay I guess but I hate the inconsistencies in her character as well.  She goes from being super needy and incapable to being the tough mom who's holding it all together to then being like vindictive and irritable - which I mean I guess you can blame that a little bit on the reveal (don't want to put any spoilers).  Given that this occurred within less than a day, because this show supposedly shows what happens in real time, it seems odd that there are such crazy shifts in character between these two people.  Everyone else's acting also appears on point, at least for the most part, but these two specific characters, im not sure if its the writing for them or the acting but it kinda throws me off everytime their in a scene.  Despite this, pretty good plotline but its too many left-turns and right-turns where something also happens but doesn't quite happen and things get messed up or plans have to change every hour or less than that.  It's a sort of ""unpredictability"" that essentially becomes a little bit predictable, which I don't necessarily like in my movies - kinda like when you watch a horror story and you know theres gonna be a jump scare within the next 5 seconds of something happening and you're like goddamit why did i have to be right..  its like the story only advances because people are unreasonable and brash where they shouldn't be and it stays on point or a certain plotline because people are reasonable and make smart decisions momentarily, before some kinda of sneaky, brash, oversight/undersight happens to advance the story.  It's a very good story and the time ticking down after each episode is a good cliffhanger and made me want to watch more despite the above mentioned.",1455667200,3,2196,4.757894736842105
1468670,5,B00005JLF2,Love the show and the concept. Great show to binge watch.,1455580800,,57,4.2727272727272725
1468671,3,B00005JLF2,"Interesting approach - unusual story.  I missed the series when it first came out - but it was highly recommended.  I found myself questioning many times why this was supposed to be worth while.  I still wonder whether 180 turns are genius by the writers or just stupid tricks (like a revelation that the prior scenes were dreams - and not real) - but I am leaning toward the latter.  I am hoping that the person recommending this series was right - just recommending something later than Season 1.

And, how many times can a person be kidnapped in a 24 hour day?",1455580800,,563,4.427184466019417

1468881,2,B00005JLF2,"Waaaaay too dark and violent for me. We started series 1 and in five episodes we saw chopped up dead bodies, watched adults having sex, saw scantily dressed teenagers having sex (whose parents wonder why their child would be in that situation), saw homicide after homicide, and watched nothing but dark, dark non-entertainment. Very little engaging dialogue and lots of racing around from one murder scene to another, where almost all the ""good guys"" (FBI) are evil. I'm sick and tired of calling evil, good, and calling good, evil. Nearly every single TV series available today is based off this dark and miserable ""entertainment"", leaving one empty and sickened about the state of the Hollywood fare being offered. No wonder our children are depressed, committing suicide, or trying to escape on drugs. Everything they see is about that. How about some genuine entertainment for a change?",1455580800,3,890,5.102739726027397

Maybe the craziness was intentional - as in, this would never happen, we're just throwing it all at you!  Blam blam blam. Dialogue was puny, a lot of one word responses from irritable people looking around suspiciously. A lot of people doing seriously stupid things. I must join in with many other reviewers and say ""what in the world was so good about this show?""  :-p  So I've panned it and am free to do so, but you don't have to take my word for it.

1472338,2,B00005JLF2,Loved the first 7 or 8 shows. They have to make it last 24 hrs (shows). It slowed down and just became goofy like a soap opera. Not realistic as it moved into later shows. Watched to show 11. Can't stand anymore. Done with it.,1448064000,,226,4.044444444444444

1472546,2,B00005JLF2,"Did only Season 1 stink??? My latest binge watch....a testament to my addiction to staying up all night watching ANYTHING.  I have just made it through the first season and may just skip to the last to see if it improved over its 10 year run.  Maybe that would explain its popularity and awards. After cutting cable, I have streamed most of the best, A-list series, like Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Damages, etc. Now I am exploring B-list candidates hoping for a winner. This is not it. The concept was cool .That's where the positive comments end. The acting is hilariously bad.  I don't know if the casting call was for ""emotionally stunted types"" or the director was going for a thriller-spoof. Kiefer (even his name starts me giggling) Sutherland as a counter-terrorist Jack Bauer, reminds me of a hamster with a bad bleach job. They forgot, however, to give his wife, Leslie Hope, a bleach job...on her teeth. Really, it's distracting. Usually such brown teeth are reserved for old English movies. It is bitchily fun to do a ""Joan Rivers"" on the actors' looks mostly because criticizing this awful mess is the only entertainment I get from watching it. The finale left me gasping....with laughter. I suspect the writers got stoned or drunk, wrote this as a satire, and discovered they had a hit drama from the viewing public who loves daytime soaps.",1447804800,,1350,4.785407725321888

Now I'm glad I didn't because I don't have to wait a whole week in between episodes to find out what happens next - how excruciating that must have been with all the cliff-hangers in this show!

I started watching Season 1 on my Amazon Fire Stick on a Saturday and ended up binge-watching the entire season that weekend.  The story is so fast-paced and riveting, that you can't stop watching.  It's like a good book that you can't put down - you have to find out what happens next.

1474557,5,B00005JLF2,"Season 1 of 24 stars Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer. Jack Bauer works in the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) based out of Los Angeles California. He puts his all into his job and ends up juggling the demands of protecting  Senator David Palmer and his family from being assassinated (Senator David Palmer is played by Dennis Haysbert also known as the Allstate Insurance guy) and looking after his daughter  Kim.  Kim ran away when Jack Bauer and his wife Teri were about to talk to Kimberly about a personal family issue. Things get even more complicated when Jack Bauer learns that there is a mole within his own agency and his daughter Kim and her friend Janet have been kidnapped.  Of course, there is so much more to 24 than what I just listed an Season 1 of the 24 series definitely keeps a person in suspense.  There is even information online about certain key addresses such as for  2350 Dunlop Plaza in Los Angeles California to be an office building location for the hour sequence of 1-2 am in the 24 tv series of season 1 (listed via online wikia).",1444176000,,1058,4.513089005235602

1474740,2,B00005JLF2,"UPDATED:
What I wrote below still holds but after sticking through the full first season I had to downgrade this. The plot holes are so glaring we just couldn't keep ignoring them, even after really really trying.  Not worth our time, we're moving on to different shows.

The show has lots of action and suspense but the plot is ridiculous if you think about it at all. The villains' schemes are so overly and needlessly complicated that it reminds me of the old Batman TV series. SPOILER ALERT FIRST TWO EPISODES - for example, to get an assassin into a breakfast banquet to kill a presidential candidate the terrorists put someone on a plane next to a journalist, steal his id on the plane, parachute out over the desert while blowing up the plane, put the id in a case with a homing device and bury it in the desert where it is later picked up by someone who delivers it to the assassin who has just spent several months having plastic surgery so that he looks like the journalist, and hack into the airline's computer system to erase the record of the real journalist being on the plane. Really? With all that time, effort, risk and money they couldn't just forge a press pass? Or how about just shoot the guy while he's wandering around outside his hotel with minimal security?",1444176000,3,1282,4.521551724137931

1474904,5,B00005JLF2,"'24' is by far one of the best, if not THE best, shows that my wife & I have ever had the privilege of watching when it comes to pure, high adrenaline entertainment!! From the start to the finish of each episode this show offers nothing short of the biggest ""bang for your buck"".....and I mean that quite literally! Kiefer Sutherland plays the role of Jack Bauer (he works for the CTU.....Counter Terrorist Unit) so well that it's nothing short of amazing. It's as if he was ""born"" to play this role. It's the type of role for someone like himself, Tom Cruise or Matt Damon to play and not too many others could pull it off the way that Kiefer S. does in this exciting, hang onto your seat type of action series. Each season is all about what happens in any given 24 hour period.....one full day......24 shows @ 1 hour each = 24 hours......thus the title '24'. If you like shows involving lots of action with great story lines....then this show is definitely for you! Enjoy!!",1444176000,,975,4.4525139664804465

Incredibly well written and spectacularly acted, this television series has twists and turns that will keep you guessing.

I highly recommend it. Includes an alternate ending with and without commentary from co-creator and co-executive producer Joel Surnow, and an introduction to Season One by Kiefer Sutherland.

I watched the first episodes when the series first appeared and dropped it when the candidate for President who was married and the father of two presented himself as a trustworthy, moral man but was  edging close to having an affair with an aide. Hypocrite politician, nothing new there. Or so I thought. My recent binge watching revealed the writers are smarter than that. In fact they are masters in presenting surprising plot twists and getting into the minds of even the worst criminals letting the viewer delve into questions of good and evil while Jack Bauer keeps us on the edge of out seat wondering how he will get out of his latest predicament.",1443484800,,726,4.761904761904762

I thought the first 13 episodes were great, then it kind of lost energy and the story line began to become monotonous. However, I never saw the ending of the season coming, great surprise!
The acting was great amongst the principal players with the exception of the actress who played Jacks wife. She always had a deer in the headlights look on her face, and I got the feeling she was pretty green. I haven't watched the second season yet as I'm worn out from the first. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 10 for the first half of the season but only a 6 for the second half.",1440633600,,685,4.0814814814814815

1478804,4,B00005JLF2,"Action-packed thriller, cleverly conceived and expertly written. However, there are a few logical gaps, but they do not detract from the action-packed story line, which is full of twists and turns. With a few exceptions, the acting is terrific. Photography, make-up, and lighting are superb. And, behind the raw, gut-wrenching drama, the thoughtful viewer can draw some philosophical conclusions of how this series mirrors what's sad in contemporary USA society where virtuous men and women with uncompromising courage are so rare they almost always must stand alone fighting Herculean battles against the forces of corruption and moral decay.",1439510400,,643,5.571428571428571
1478805,2,B00005JLF2,"The script, performances, and cultural settings are much lower quality  than  I expected, based on the hype.  This series is clearly not on par with other good and gritty series, such as Deadwood, Justified, Boardwalk Empire, The Americans, Transparent, Homeland, The Wire, Blacklist, Orange is the New Black, The Good Wife, The Sopranos, etc. I would recommend any/all of the above rather than '24'.  Having said that, I am nevertheless hooked into Season 2, and will likely play  it through to the end -- as I await  the next seasons of better options and tend to other tasks (knitting, ironing, etc.).

1478992,4,B00005JLF2,Over the years I have heard so many talk this show up so very much but had never seen one episode. I would see portions of shows in announcements for marathon sessions for when I finally with nothing to do while away on work I finally started this season one. I would say that I began to see what others had spoken of because I was almost addicted to finish the season and the drama and could not wait for the time to watch the next episode. I loved the drama and the cliff hanging way the shows would end as the teased ever so provocatively the next chapter in the show. I do believe that I am glad that I did not watch this in real time as I would probably have pulled my hair out waiting a week instead of only a few hours or a day. But I must say that I have NEVER seen a conclusion that I hated more. I was sick to see it end the way that it did and am not inclined to pick up another season if this is the pattern going forward.,1439078400,,934,3.8697916666666665
1478993,2,B00005JLF2,"Didn't watch it during it's original release. I don't think it holds up very well, story seems very drawn out, lacks suspense, and A few of the characters(i.e. both the wives) are inconveniences that you have to ignore to enjoy the show. You never grow to dislike the bad guy because he changes every few episodes, and ultimately ends with a terribly unbelievable accent. Plot ""twists"" are seen a mile away, mostly to fall flat. As a pilot season I'm willing to forgive some of these errors, but the following seasons will have some work to do to win me over.",1439078400,,559,4.544554455445544

1479231,4,B00005JLF2,This show is very well done from story line to acting.  The only reason that i did not give it 5 stars is that i found it very frustrating to watch 24 episodes before you know how the story will end.  I prefer shows that have some closure with each episode than this concept of a story taking 24 episodes to come to conclusion.  So you have no idea of what is going to happen from the cliff hanger first episode until 24 hours episodes later.  That is just too frustrating for me.  This first season has a shocking ending that frankly was upsetting to me.  You do get vested in certain characters and seeing them go through hell for 23 episodes and then die - is not fun for me at all.  The writers are definitely going for shock value but it really turned me off.,1438819200,,764,4.156462585034014

1479427,3,B00005JLF2,"Frustratingly hokey and consistently stupid bad judgment by all ""non-professionals"". So much so, that's overly obvious that they're just stringing the viewer along to build the suspense. The result, too many, ""Are kidding me!"" moments.",1438300800,,235,5.742857142857143
1479428,3,B00005JLF2,"OK, admittedly I am a bit cynical since I used to work in this field to an extent. And while any show should be granted a certain theatrical license to make a topic more interesting and exciting, the plot to ""24"" was so convoluted, its action sequences so absurd, its antagonists so cartoonish that I I could not bring myself to grant it the suspension of disbelief often required of television and movie.

All thriller genre shows make things more exciting than they are in reality and given the premise of the show, an hour of exciting tv for each hour in the fictional day of Agent Jack Bauer, perhaps it was unavoidable that the action sequences bordered on the absurd. So maybe I expected too much from the show and was as a result so thoroughly disappointed. I even found myself angry at the show at times for how bad the writing was. That all being said, I did watch it in its entirety even if it was largely because I was morbidly curious. But I can assure you I won't be watching the following seasons.",1438214400,,1011,4.406417112299465

1480087,3,B00005JLF2,"I have mixed feelings and impressions about this series. It is certainly packed with action--it really stimulates the flow of adrenalin. On the other hand, the action overtakes the character development to a certain extent. Everything moves so fast that it is hard to really become involved with any one person. In my opinion, it is certainly not the caliber of ""The Wire"" or ""Oz."" All of that being said, I have just started watching Season 2. Perhaps it is the kind of show that takes time to allow the viewer to become invested in the characters.",1436745600,,549,4.670103092783505

1480143,4,B00005JLF2,"Well I really loved the suspense and pretty much everyone acted so well. Making Nina Myers the culprit leaves lots of loopholes of how she was so good and vigilant for the entire time, supporting Jack and catching Jamie (Jamie was working for Gaines and Nina for Drazen et.al).

Jacks character is pretty straight forward. He is the definition of a hero who looks out for everyones best interest even if it means breaking the rules.

The actual twenty four hours it takes to get to the end of season one is a hell of a commitment to ask of a society that can hardly sit at the table long enough to eat dinner.

I won't be back for the other 216 hours.",1434412800,,331,3.8676470588235294
1481095,3,B00005JLF2,Aninteresting idea  but the plot has holes in it big enough to drive a steamship through it. As far as I was concerned they could have dropped all the segments with his daughter. In the show she appeared to be a selfish teenager. the worst thing of all was that she never showed remorse during the course of the entire show. If you want to binge and have about 18 hours free the show is as I said interesting but be fore  warned that whenever you see the daughter another ridiculous twist in the plot is about to happen.,1434412800,,520,4.242424242424242

As I write this review we are more than half way through Season One and find it increasingly difficult to stick with it. The plot lines are becoming more and more unbelievable, the acting is terrible, and I can't believe the apparent lack of any technical advisors.  We have decided to try and finish this season and start the next one in hopes that they hired new writers and the acting improves. If Season Two is not significantly better within a few episodes we will consider it a failed experiment.  Be warned...Season One REALLY sucks.",1432944000,,655,4.5423728813559325

1482485,5,B00005JLF2,"We started watching this fresh on the heels of Justified (with Timothy Oliphant). Suffice it to say, the acting on Season 1 was so bad (ESP in comparison to Justified) that there were times hubby and I were laughing our a**es off at Season 1. The women in this season are totally lame and helpless (not to mention all have really ugly haircuts...??!!) and can't seem to make the correct decision EVER. And every government agent aside from Jack Bauer is totally, incomprehensibly, incompetent. The plot points are very predictable and I drove hubby nuts calling out what would happen before it happened - I know, totally annoying but I couldn't help myself. And I have no idea how Keifer Sutherland managed to sound like a South Park parody of himself every time he said what hours the episodes took place between (seriously, he was channeling Trey Parker).

ANYWAY - with all of that being said, by the time we made it to Season 3 (OMG, literally three days of my life I can never get back), hubby and I had kinda' fallen in love with Jack Bauer and his amazing shite-kicking abilities. It is because of this that I must, out of respect, give Season 1 its due respect.

So, if you're on the fence, and have several days of free time waiting to be spent, this is totally worth it.",1432598400,,1280,4.512931034482759

Later, returned from work and did the same!  Kiefer Southerland is spectacular as Jack Bauer, hed of the CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) in LA.  This Season 1 is not only an individual story, but sets up character and CTU related information pertinent to the entire 8 years of the 24 seasons.

I'd heard good things about 24 but maybe it was 'good at the time'. The counting clock probably looked good when it was on network TV (multiple advert breaks) but having a double up after a black screen gets very annoying. The whole thing hasn't aged well but then it is almost 15 years old. It reminds me of blacklist, it all sounds and looks very slick but it has glaringly silly plot points and holes throughout.

This was a lot of fun to watch with so many twisting plots and many things that you just don't see coming. Quite often what you think is going to happen or who is going to turn up being a bad guy so to say isn't the bad guy at all. This was hard not to watch multiple episodes in a row.

1485516,2,B00005JLF2,"Sorry to all of you 24 fans.  First of all, I love the concept - nothing else like it on TV and for that reason alone it should be watched.  But the writing .. oh my goodness.  First of all, the bad decision made by characters in this show that put them knee deep in trouble - it reminds me of that commercial where the teenagers are at haunted house and instead of getting into the running car they go hide behind a row of chainsaws - and the chainsaw massacre guy is just shaking his head (""Really?"") .. It's like every bad decision that a person in trouble could make to get deeper into trouble is made by these characters.  I found myself sitting there in agony watching it.  How could they be so stupid???

And, remember, this all takes place in one 24 hour period, the number of times things happen at exactly the last second to completely change the direction of events - unbelievable - truly NOT believable.  Just as a person is about to push a button, or shoot someone, or be found out, or whatever - just at that last second - something happens to save the day or change the course.  It's ridiculous at times.

In hour 23, Teri Bauer says, ""When is this going to end?"" and I laughed saying to myself - I agree!  When??

All that said, watch it if just for the concept which is killer by the way.  Ok I'm going to hit the submit button ... unless something happens at the last second to stop me!",1427328000,,1404,4.197761194029851

The format with each episode being another hour of the same day and the way it follows separate threads keeps the action going. It makes you want to watch the next episode right away. Perfect for binge watching - I love how the Fire stick goes automatically to the next episode.
With that said it isn't a perfect show by any means. The story thins out as you advance through the day and they keep resurrecting it with the typical tricks of any TV series. At one point you start to wonder how many agents are you willing to let die to save a couple of people who don't even like you.

1487431,5,B00005JLF2,"Just like Pringles, or Ruffles, whatever - you can't have just one.  There have been some seriously sleepless nights in our house since we started watching.  And I almost feel like binge-watching 24 episodes is achievement :)  But I am so glad that I waited to watch this on Amazon Prime, because there is no way I would have lived through a season having to wait a week between episodes!  I am even more happy that I am not part of Jack Bauer's family!

The show is absolutely incredible.  It runs in real time, so each episode takes one hour, with each thread of action happening concurrently.  Starting off with Jack and his family in the living room, it quickly goes from there to kidnapping, espionage, and an attempt to thwart an assassination on the black candidate for president, played by Dennis Haysbert.  I WISH this president could actually run, interesting dynamic to see his incredibly strong integrity in tension with those around him and how that impacts the overall story.

Sutherland is the perfect star for this show - family guy, not the standard tough guy, but smart and resourceful.  He is a very well-balanced character.  This is truly the longest day of his life, and you get to share it every step of the way with him.  There are a few really key surprises that will shock you.

I have found only a few small mistakes throughout, sometimes something gets misplaced slightly, etc., but not something that bothers you unless you are an editor for a living.

Watch this show, but be warned, it is incredibly addictive, and with so many seasons, you and your family will need to accommodate!",1425254400,33,1612,4.670212765957447

Are tasked with stopping terrorists from attacking the United States from Using nerve gas, one season , a nuclear weapon other season watch to See what else he's up agianst the name 24 stands for 24 hours that's how long he has to stop the threat every thing is in real time if it takes the president to have to take a two hour flight then for two episodes he's going to be in that plane for example 1 episode is one hour and the season is 24 episodes for 24 hours. When you watch this series your going to want to watch the next episode to see what hapens next they do a good job of leaving you wondering what's about to happen next at the end of the episode. I.Think both men and women are going to like this series. If you do. There are about 8 season's with 24 episodes so it will last a long time for you to watch the entire series. I liked it so much even before it was on amazon prime I bought every season as they came out. I have probley watched this at least 3 times over the years and will probley want to watch it again sometime in the future so I hope you try it out and watch a few episodes and see for yourself how well you like it.

1488394,3,B00005JLF2,"I'm giving this popular, well regarded series just a #3, though the directing, acting and sophisticated plot (and the multiple subplots) would seem to qualify it for a #4 or #5.  As other reviewers have noted, the series is indeed suspenseful and fast paced.  However, it is just too violent.  Brutally violent scenes occurred throughout the episodes, interrupted every so often with non-violent conversations between certain characters.  But, even the non-violent segments were filled with stress, quarrels and angry accusations.  I watched the first 5 CDs, and the beginning of the 6th CD, before finally deciding to give up.  I can't reveal the nature of the violent episodes as examples without being a spoiler.  So in short, the episodes are gritty, very dark, relentlessly tense and stressful, with a great deal of portrayed anguish and bloodshed.  Could we say that this is art imitating life?  Was this what the events following the JFK assassination were like, with multiple murders, mysterious deaths of people who knew too much, and a massive coverup?  I certainly wouldn't recommend this for youngsters.",1424476800,,1115,5.213483146067416

Kim is really the strongest female character.  Overall, season 1 moves very slowly and is pretty boring.  On the flip side, Jack's character is portrayed as more vulnerable and unsteady compared to later years when he is basically just a machine.  But, for a 1st season, it's still a worthy effort.

They take a licking but find other to keep on ticking. Acting is contrived at times. The undercurrent of a mystery about why Bauer is targeted is
probably the redeeming part after 8 episodes. I guess it is best summed by ""All in a days work."" I am not drawn to binge watch these episodes. One a day is my limit.",1424390400,,453,4.27906976744186

I like Keifer Sutherland, but I couldn't picture this guy with a sort of baby face and a cute little turned up nose as a tough spy guy. Sort of like, No way! Well, I now guess Keifer is a pretty good actor because he makes me forget how cute he is and I can totally buy him as a tough guy. And then there is the program format. The show is 24 because each episode is an hour in a 24 hour day in Jack Bauer's life. The show moves along at a very brisk pace with two or three storylines going at the same time. Sort of like real life does. It never slows down or gets boring. I do very much enjoy it. Five stars for acting and storytelling.",1424390400,,784,3.845679012345679

1489143,5,B00005JLF2,"I never watched this series when it first aired, but picked up on it after all eight seasons were over on Netflix.  This was the season that started it all, and started a revolution.  The ticking clock and real-time storyline is very unique and works to perfection.  Jack Bauer is a character that is simply unforgettable. His ability to get the job done no matter what the cost makes me like him even more.  The characters are developed enough, though the story revolves around the action and not so much those characters.  David and Sherry Palmer are well acted, as are Tony Almeida, Nina Myers, and some of the other memorable characters from this first season.

Jack Bauer gets contacted to try and stop an assassination of a U.S. Senator who is running for president.  His wife and daughter are kidnapped, and he must cooperate with the kidnappers or they will die.  He is trying to stop an assassination and get his family back at the same time.  There are moles, betrayals, and drama around every turn.  There are 24 episodes in each season that represent each hour of the day the story takes place.  I was so happy to have watched it on Netflix, where I could binge watch it and not have to wait.  I don't think I would have been able to wait so long to find out what happened next.  The season starts a bit slow, but ends with a shocker of a season finale.

It is action packed, and  while this is unfortunate I do believe it presents a pretty realistic perspective on how 'things' are with our government agencies. The concerns are more about 'who is doing what', 'how can I bring positive attention to what I am doing', rather than about 'minding ones own business' and essentially just doing a good job. The action/drama is very good. I wish there were more seasons of 24 coming down the pike!",1419638400,,548,4.708333333333333

1490262,5,B00005JLF2,"Excellent show considering how much unscripted garbage content there is available.  This show has the usual TV series flaws in which the writers over create drama by having characters do obviously stupid things.  Just as in a low budget horror film, Jack is left alone in a field when we know that terrorist assassins were spending gobs of money to have the power grid shut off in that area.  The viewer can expect an overwhelming military operation to be taking place there but some our counter terrorist expert characters think are skeptical.

1491106,5,B00005JLF2,"Was just scrolling through Amazon Instant Video trying to find a T.V. show to watch. For whatever reason, this caught my eye and I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Now I don't watch T.V. as much as other people do, and I find it pretty hard to get hooked on a show, or in other words, a show that is so addictive that it makes me want to keep watching and watching to see how the story unravels. From the first episode, you're left wanting to know more. There's plot twists everywhere imaginable, and any ""dull"" moments are quickly dispatched as action can come at the most unexpected moments.

As far as the actors, they're all great. I especially have admired the role that Kiefer Sutherland plays. Over the course of the first season I have grown attached to the gritty, no-nonsense, cunning character that Jack is. He goes to the limit to protect those he cares about most.

All in all, give this show a shot. I found it very hard to watch just one episode at a time. Hours of sleep were definitely lost over this first season, and I look forward to losing a lot more as I watch the rest in time.",1418256000,,1110,4.2559241706161135

What's the deal with all the women???  *MOST* of them (with a very few exceptions) are spies, assassins, traitors, plotters, liars, etc.  In retrospect (and it applies to all the following seasons) - all the most deadly and elaborate conspiracies that one could not have even imagined are done by women and through women (or their connections with the male characters).  If it's not a spoiler for the entire series:  just watch closely  :)
But most importantly:  ENJOY!

Jack is the only one that comes off well here... though the Presidential Candidate eventually wises up in the end. I spent most of the '24' hours yelling at the TV (good thing I live in the country) because of a seemingly endless string of stupid decisions by nearly every character in the cast. It was as if Jack has this herd of cats, and surrounding the cats are a pack of wolves. Jack is doing his best to herd them to safety but they all keep dashing off in all directions.

So, thankfully, Amazon Prime is allowing me to catch up on all these classic shows. Thus far, I've seen the first 8 episodes and absolutely love the format and nail-biting action.

The first season has a few issues that any new show has. There is a bit of poor writing surrounding Jack's wife Terri. By the time the season is over and you're starting season 2 you'll see how that poor writing became good character development for Jack and his daughter (the insanely hot Elisha Cuthbert).

Even though it can be a bit over the top, the good acting seen most of the time makes up for the few ""seriously"" moments (remember you can't demand too much reality because the extraordinary events in the story all have to take place in a single 24 hours period).

1493116,1,B00005JLF2,"Got through 4 episodes hoping it would get better only to find that it got worse.  This show gives off the bad kind of suspense that involves a whole lot of absurd coincidences and cheesy, unbelievable moments.  Those kind of moments where you are cringing in your seat.  The problem is that they insert those moments every 5 seconds until you are just pissed off that so many coincidences in one day is an un-quantifiable number for odds.  EVERY main character story line on the show seems to suffer from this same fate.  In three hours time these individuals faced more action than most Navy Seals face in a lifetime (Slightly sarcastic here but not by much).  So much unreal and unbelievable situations here but the problem is that they are trying to be 100 percent serious about it.  I really tried to like it given the ratings but that bad script writing that plagued the 90s/early 2000s, before the industry realized that people like believable situations, is completely apparent here.  I was completely misled about the quality of this show.  Oh and one last thing; all side characters on this show seem to be completely unbelievable idiots, jerks, or cannon fodder.  For example, all police officers on this show have the brain and attention span of a hamster and need constant guidance by the ""expert"" main characters.  That is just one example of many lame side character types on this show.",1412380800,7,1401,4.74793388429752

The writing, the casting/acting, the action, stunt work and pace... ALL are phenomenal!
And Sarah Clarke is my favorite of ALL the actresses on the entire run of the show.  Both her character and her performance.
Lastly, I became a big fan of Carlos Bernard after Season 1 of 24!  LOVE him!

1493250,5,B00005JLF2,"When this series first ran on TV I was interested in seeing it, however I detest trying to enjoy a TV show when it is interrupted every seven minutes with another seven minutes of commercials, so I passed it up.  Now that it is available  on Amazon Prime without interruptions, I gave it a try and was overwhelmed!
Without the ususal interruptions, the story races through at an amazing speed.  The writing, casting and acting are superb.  Multiple characters have their own problems, along with the main anti-criminal theme -- and as soon as you begin rooting for a certain character, that person suddenly turn out to be a bad guy. . . and as soon as you begin to not trust a character and wait for this person's ""just desserts,"" that character turns out to be a loving and trusted individual.
There are dozens of plot twists with each episode that keep me ""glued to the tube.""
I am currently near the end of Season Three and can't stop watching, raising hell with my bedtime schedule.  I don't see how they can keep it up (or how I can survive) through the remaining Seasons -- I believe there are at least five or more in all.

My husband and I started watching it and got interested enough in the first 2 episodes that we had to get to the point that the wife and daughter were rescued, but as soon as they were I shut it off which was not at the end of that episode because I was afraid they would do something stupid and get caught again and keep stringing us along. I have no intentions of going back to watch the rest of the season or any other seasons of this laborious show. What should have taken about 3 episodes took 13 and there were times I wanted the people to get killed because they were so stupid.

1494695,5,B00005JLF2,"Innovative, and intense, 24 was a groundbreaking series that drew watchers into a classic evil versus good scenario:  the potential reality of a well-funded and motivated terrorist cell striking at an American political figure versus the competent and honorable yet flawed/human U.S. counterterrorism system, embodied by Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer.

What few may recall is that 24's debut was originally to be September 2001 but was pushed back to November in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist acts. Given the nation's raw emotional state when the series premiered, its straightforward get-the-job-done-by-any-means-possible approach, tempered by Bauer's personal & emotional entanglement in the premise, resonated deeply with American society and no doubt contributed to its initial popularity.

This is without question Sutherland's career-defining role, as it was for many of this and future seasons' cast members.",1409616000,,923,5.873134328358209

1495161,5,B00005JLF2,"From a writers point of view: 24 is a first and proves all the doubting Thomas' wrong when it comes to dealing with real-time, similar events, over the top action drama, acting, screen writing, camera and film directing. what is claimed to never work on TV works for 24..with all 8 seasons to prove it. No other action drama compares to it in my opinion. 24 is the one show wonder on how the impossible can be made possible!

However, we were shocked and disappointed at how racy a few of the adolescent scenes were. Especially the one where Jack's daughter's friend and boyfriend are briefly shown in a bed during the sex act. My wife and I were both mortified viewing this with our teenage boys. Why the writers had to take the low-road on what turned out to THE best action/drama on tv ever, I'll never know.

1495775,4,B00005JLF2,"If you're looking for a spy show with contemporary issues and plenty of action, this is it. Keifer Southerland does a great job as Jack Bauer, former Special Forces operative who now works in a US government counterterrorist unit. Lots of other attractive people in the cast, mostly not that well known; Dennis Haysbert (The Unit, Allstate commercials) is also good as the US President. My main criticism is that the sensationalism used to ""keep you hanging"" from episode to episode detracts from the show, especially regarding Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter. The frequency with which she makes stupid decisions regardless of past experience is just unrealistic and maddening. But maybe I'm expecting too much......Overall, an entertaining show and worth watching given the paucity of good dramas available on television these days.",1408060800,,828,5.32824427480916

1496196,2,B00005JLF2,"I just finished watching season 2014 and it was great so I started watching the earlier seasons staring with episode 1. It wasn't long before I realized that I tried this once before but I could not remember why I stopped watching the series. It was around episode 2 or 3 and it all came back but I said to myself - ""Self...give it a chance, maybe you weren't ready for it back then.""

Well I made to, or should I say struggled to, episode 20 and just could not take it anymore. I cannot fathom  how Jack's daughter gets kidnapped 3 times by THE SAME PEOPLE and at the same time his wife is, raped, kidnapped by different members of the same group and while escaping bangs her head and develops  temporary amnesia. Then Jack is taken hostage by the leader that hired the PEOPLE to kidnap his wife and daughter.

Meanwhile, throughout all of this Jack is trying to prevent an assassination attempt on a Senator who is running for president.

Now, these events do not happen all at once, they happen throughout episode 1 -20. Its like the writers never could figure out how to end a season.

So, if you are a huge 24 fan this may be for you. However, as hard as I tried the old series is not for me.",1407715200,,1197,4.251101321585903

Jack lost a bit of credibility with his quick trigger finger and lack of protocol, although to a degree that's what the part needed. This could well be one of Keifer Sutherland's better roles. I'm into Season 2 now and so far haven't seen that. This season holds my attention more than the first. I think they have the right actors in the right parts. I look forward to each episode. If Season 2 continues to be as good as it is at this point I'll give it a 5 star rating. As usual, kudos to Amazon for bringing this show to Prime for free!",1407456000,,714,4.296296296296297

1498512,4,B00005JLF2,I definitely enjoyed the series but felt at times it was a bit prolonged unnecessarily. I understand the layout or format and that it has two be stretched out over a 24 hour period but at the same time I wanted it to end.after his wife was kidnapped and finally reclaimed I was surprised that the main character did not supply his wife and daughter with weapons an attempt to train them to survive.his wife finally shot the man that raped her and was prepared to shoot anyone else for that matter in order to get free. I was intrigued by the secrets with and secrets with and secrets at the CTS installation.also that even in a intelligence office there is politicking and manipulation and control issues.actors chosen to play the villains were good but at the same time I fell for to have a real authentic flavor they should have picked up genuine actors that had the look and the accent of the country they were from.one possibility for the father figure villain would have been Jurgen Prochnow he has the kind of rough and gritty face that is perfect for villainy.also the main characters daughter after escaping from a potential rape and kidnap situation be thrown in with hardened criminals in a jail situation and then she impetuous lea decides to go back into a additional tense situation of a drug situation drug deal. I just felt it was a bit incredible that she could be that stupid.for the most part despite my criticisms I enjoy the series and will most likely go on to the additional seasons to see if they've made additional improvements on the character.because the situation is stretched out over the 24 hour period week after week it doesn't have the same visceral gutsy satisfaction the regular spy movie should have,1406246400,,1734,4.651465798045603

We have tried to watch it on tv in years past but never got into it; neither of us like the beginning where there are like four screenshots of different things going on. Thankfully we decided to give it try. It's free with our Amazon Prime membership!! So far we like the show. The characters are believable, the plot is exciting & it helps knowing that there are like eight or more seasons of this show so it must be pretty good! Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 12+ years, you've heard of the show & probably have a pretty good idea what it's about.

OMG'SH! It is so intense but so well done. I sometimes have difficulty in watching some of the scenes & yet I go back for more.

I like stories/programs about our government & its operation (or lack of it). How overly dramatic 24 is in the actual dealings of our counter terrorist may be or not be, it brings a reality to what may possibly (probably) go on that we are so unaware of. Whew!

 If you like to see constant horrible things happening to people, human life meaning absolutely nothing to some of the characters, too many of them, in fact, a lot of violence, betrayals, and traumatic events, almost no likeable, sympathetic characters,  and something with an unhappy ending this is for you.

It starts out this year, with Jack showing up four years since ""they"" saw him last.  I decided  to watch the ""old"" series to learn the history of Jack's background and to give me more insight for the new episodes this year.  Now I'm hooked!
I enjoyed the first series so much that I started binge watching.  I watch 2 -3 episodes a day whenever I get a chance.
It's also fun to see some familiar actors that are in movies or on TV now, that had parts in those years on the show.
I'm into 7 episodes of the second season right now.
I strongly recommend watching  Season One if you'd like a different series to follow.  I only thing I wish I could have seen the pilot before I started this season.  I think it would have explained some things in the first few episodes.",1405036800,,912,4.136363636363637

1501097,4,B00005JLF2,"Watching this on Amazon Prime makes it very worthwhile for me.
I can't imagine watching a tv series like this with the commercials involved.
I rated it 4 stars for the entertainment value, deducting a star because, like most tv drama's, there's too many things happening that simply couldn't be real but it's television so you grin and bear it. Acting is credible and I'm usually curious to get to the next episode after each one I watch. Well done series",1405036800,,455,4.62962962962963

1501892,5,B00005JLF2,"Season one of the 24 series is excellent.  A nice introduction to Jack Bauer as a regular guy who juggles a wife and kid with this high powered job as a field agent for C.T.U. and also acts as an administrator back at the office.  You just know that somethings got to give.  Eventually as always his first love, which is his job overwhelms everything else in his life.  It's kind of interesting that the first season hit the airwaves about a month after 9/11, and was so on time,as this show always seems to be.  The storyline is multi- layered, with maybe three stories going on at once, which is kind of alluded to by the split screen effect.  Then near the end of the season all the stories intertwine and become one story, which it always was.  The fact that 24 always shows that this stuff is complicated and there are many players involved, including sellouts on our side who go for the fast buck, is so true.  Nice series and very on time.",1404518400,,946,4.3352272727272725

1501894,1,B00005JLF2,"Hmmm, where to begin.  The premise of the show is innovative, particularly given the rise of both international terrorism as well as home grown terrorism.  The acting is not bad either.  The main issue with this season is the writing.  To paraphrase one reviewer, I only hope our own Dept of Homeland Security isn't this stupid.  For instance, season one featured seven kidnappings in one day.  Really, how stupid.  The plot line was unrealistic and just plain dumb.  The actors did what they could with what little they had to work with but, in the end, even good acting could not save this show.  How it lasted eight seasons is a testament to Hollywood not putting out quality dramas.  I tried to watch it but, in the end, had to quit watching with two episodes left.  It was just not believeable.

Probably should avoid this one.",1404432000,5,832,4.623287671232877

1502440,5,B00005JLF2,"We were not viewers of 24 until we started watching the newest 12 hour season, ""Live Another Day"". That prompted us to put all 8 prior seasons on our Amazon Prime Watchlist. We watched all 24 episodes of season one over 3 days. We have resolved to see every episode of every season so we can connect all the amazing plot points. The concept of ""real time"" events is compelling. The stories are one surprise after the other, the writing is fast paced and personal and the acting is top shelf. I strongly recommend that any truly intelligent and insightful viewer download this series and resolve to experience every heart stopping season.",1404172800,,637,4.696428571428571
1502441,1,B00005JLF2,Probably some of the worst writing and plot I have ever seen. If you want to scream at your TV because the characters do stupid things this is a series for you.,1404172800,,160,4.03125

1502646,5,B00005JLF2,"I am sure that Jack Bauer would not tolerate this cruel and self-serving treatment of marine mammals.  I am also sure he would "" break them out""!  FREE TILLY!!!!",1404000000,,161,4.517241379310345
1502647,5,B00005JLF2,Kind of drawn out in some of the first few episodes but overall a great watch. Gets the adrenaline going!,1404000000,,105,4.3
1502648,4,B00005JLF2,Love Keifer Sutherland!  He is perfect for 24.  The action is paced to keep attention fixed and then..the episode is over!  I have watched three episodes so far..the rest of the cast does such a good job...though something does not ring right about Jack's wife.  Good actress but chemistry does not seem on target.  There are about 197 episodes to go..and I plan to enjoy them..!,1404000000,,379,4.681818181818182

1502652,5,B00005JLF2,I love Bauer! He is hardcore but obviously has a soft spot for the truth and integrity. Great show to binge watch on amazon prime with no commercials.,1403913600,,150,4.392857142857143

1502738,5,B00005JLF2,"Can't understand why I didn't start watching this a long time ago.  Watching Breaking Bad only years after it started convinced me there was a lot of great acting, scripts and cinematography that I wasn't aware of.  This is another example.",1403913600,,240,4.829268292682927
1502739,3,B00005JLF2,I'm so glad the wife died. She was a flake and a piller. She just couldn't be casted in 24 hours.,1403827200,,97,3.6666666666666665
1502740,5,B00005JLF2,"Love everything about the program.  However, I would not recommend it for children. Lots of violence.

1502741,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" has become one of my favorite TV shows, but one reason that Season 1 stands out still is because it is not quite as over-the-top as some of the subsequent seasons, so the lengths that Jack Bauer will go to for his wife and daughter make it more believable than trying to save an abstract number of people from an unfathomable terror. Excellent!",1403827200,,349,4.46875
1502742,5,B00005JLF2,"Very addicting; I can't stop watching each of the episodes, and will want to watch all seasons of 24 played.",1403827200,,108,4.45

1502941,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is not as well acted as Orphan Black, Sherlock, or even Doctor Who.  The story lines are more like General Hospital than a cable channel drama.  That said there is something very compelling about watch 24 hours in anyone's life - especially the head of a special terrorist unit agent who is unstoppable.  I am taking a break before watching season 2.",1403740800,,353,4.571428571428571

1503064,5,B00005JLF2,"I never watched it when it was aired but heard a lot about it. I was pretty well hooked by the end of the first episode, and there was no going back after the third episode. I imagine watching it one week apart each episode made it feel a bit more realistic... Binge-watching it made it seem just so very unrealistic l, but still fun to watch. And tear-jerking sometimes too, of course.",1403568000,,386,4.301369863013699
1503065,2,B00005JLF2,"The concept of following what happens in ""real time"" over 24 hours sounded interesting. Acting was fine. But execution by the writers was awful. I understand they need some leeway to make Entertainment, but this was way out of line. Physics was violated, character patterns were tossed out whenever convenient, people did whatever unlikely thing suited the plot. (Car goes off the road and becomes a fireball...but doesn't set the dry CA hill on fire. Hi-tech government agency can't tell who called in without asking the phone company. A character holds a semi-auto with the hand behind the slide or racks the gun multiple times.) We would have given it one star and stopped watching, but it became amusing to see what screwball implausibility the screenwriters would pull next so we finished the first season. No more. Not recommended.",1403568000,3,837,5.028776978417266

1503178,3,B00005JLF2,good action cuts & dramatic tension but Southerland's daughter's part & the senator's son's part drag on & on & are finally boring - there are too many instances where the script drags probably to 'stretch' the series.,1403568000,,218,4.7631578947368425

One night I decided to see what my friend was raving about and turned on the first season of 24. I've always been a fan of Kiefer Sutherland so I knew it couldn't be disappointing. Sure enough it wasn't. It was pure excitement!

Noone would be that stupid...Other than that, each episode had enough to keep you going and want to watch the next one.  All of that to say that I did enjoy the first season minus some really stupid parts.  I have not watched any of the other seasons yet, but I am assuming that the writing must get better as the show stuck around for so long.  I look forward to starting season two.

Kiefer produces and stars in this high action and drama show that connects with most Americans who witnessed the 9/11 event yet felt powerless to do anything about it.  Jack Bauer is the rogue Counter Terrorist agent who is willing to do everything and anything to save his country and family, including breaking the rules of law and sacrificing himself.  He is what we all want to be yet humanly flawed almost to self destruction.  What few remember is that this show started taping just prior to the terrorist events.

Boy was I wrong having let it pass!  Disclaimer -first I started watching the current 24 Live Another Day, which is fantastic and brilliant.

Season 1... you have to go through it to understand the rest of the seasons, I guess, so there is no escaping it.  For the time it was made -2001, no smartphones, no NSA deep surveillance yet- it is very, very good.  My only complaint -being a perfectionist- is that at times you get impatient and feel like ""nothing is happening"", the suspense is too long, there are ""unnecessary fillers"" for time.  But of course all that in the context of comparing it to the current season, or even to the best action and political thriller movies.

Save for that, this is pure entertainment, with a twist of re-living a long-gone era of pre smartphones, mobility, flat screens and the internet of things.",1403222400,,976,4.6395348837209305

The multiple story lines that weave thru the main story keep you on the edge of your seat and unable to take a bathroom break.

It could have been 5 stars but I forgot how annoying the character of Jack's daughter can be.

1504101,5,B00005JLF2,"We do not watch much television, hence, watching a show that first aired 13-years ago.  It is easy to see why the show has been so successful.  Each episode keeps its viewers gripped as it quickly unfolds, only to leave one hanging until the next episode.  The producers generally casted the characters well, except the role of Victor Drazen.  Dennis Hopper may have been fresh off his chilling portrayal of Frank Booth in Blue Velvet, but he fell short playing a convincing Serbian terrorist.
  Overall we enjoy the show and like being able to watch episodes frequently and even back-to-back.  Hello season two.",1402963200,,612,4.883495145631068

I binged watched the first season and I am almost through the second.  My only criticism is the daughter's story line.  It is completely unbelievable and has become boring to and I am almost through the second season.

I love the fact that watching it on Prime, I can skip the sections with 'Kim' when it becomes too fantasmical a story.  Otherwise this is great fun.",1402876800,,491,4.282608695652174

1504200,5,B00005JLF2,"I'm usually not one who cares to watch this type of intense drama. So it wasn't till 2014 that I found the first 24 & was hooked from the start!! I have finally finished every show & now am watching the 24 shot in England. I love Jack & wish SO much I had a man's man like him to protect me from the evil in my own home. I hope Jack always comes back & keeps the world honest in only the way he can!!  Jack has such a soft voice & he never tries to kill anyone who has done nothing to die. My other other fav actors who are still with us in England in Chloie O'Brian. She is a great actor who I think all America has chosen her as their fav actor next to Jack. Moving Chloie from the series would be a grave mistake! In the last scene of 24 on the 8th episode when Jack is given time to try to escape by the US president, the very touching scene of a distraught Chloie & bloodied Jack saying goodbye brought me to tears!! I think Jack finally comes to see what a loyal friend Chloie has been & the last scene we see of Jack is his attempt to walk out but we all wonder how in the world is he going to do this without any friends & medical care.
I'm glad I didn't get addicted until way after the 8th episode was shot as I can enjoy each one without commercials & stay up all night watching it until I can't keep my eyes open anymore!! We love you Jack!! Please never stay away from us for years at a time! If you need a place to hide & get off the grid come to my house I have a ""safe"" room all ready for you & no one would never find you!!

AMAZON PRIME... thank you SO much that you have all 8 years/seasons of ""24"" are avail and FREE for Amazon Prime members!

OMG -- this is just fabulous.  We now have the OLD ORIGINAL and ONLY Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) Bauer via Amazon Prime, to see the history & evolution of MY hero, AMERICA's hero... and now that ""24"" has returned in May 2014 ""24 Live Another Day"" after 4 yrs break ... this 8 seasons (old) plus current season (new) for non-stop action, suspense, back stabbing, spies, terrorists.

ps:  Do you remember way back when?  WHO KNEW ...  that America would need a HERO to root for after the REAL TERRORIST ATTACK on the US happened just 2 months earlier on 9-11-01.  This show was written, shot, edited BEFORE our actual  ""9/11""
JACK BAUER...  (who seemed never needing to eat, drink water or go to restroom during a 24hr day) ... became OUR GUY, the American we all hoped to find to step up, the American PATRIOT & PROTECTOR who would NOT ""give up"" nor ""give in"" to terrorists, snipers, subversive groups, etc.

pps - I remember back in 2008 bidding so many times on eBay to get seasons 1-6 collection and finally ""winning"" for $80 + shipping for 6 seasons.  Then I spent another $60+ on Amazon for season 7, mid-season 2hr movie ""Redemption"" and season 8 to finish off my collection.  Yes, we did watch all the DVD's  1x and it was great to have non-commercial (apx 45min each), non-stop MARATHON WATCHING (my son watched a FULL ""24"" hour season, straight through for 18hrs during 1 summer break while in high school)

The other issue is the portrayal of a government bureaucratic agency that is more concerned about image than results.  The frustrating fact is that this portrayal is probably accurate.  After seeing the first season I have to wonder where this goes in Season 2.  Hopefully not more of the same distrust shown to Jack Bauer by his superiors.  That is a pretty stale story line of the good guy facing obstacles from corrupt or ambitious individuals. I avoided this show when it first appeared partly because it was shown in one hour ""real"" time increments which seemed silly and partly because I didn't have the ability to invest an hour each week in a serial tv show.  Now, I understand why viewers became addicted to it each week.",1402444800,,892,4.72258064516129

1504954,4,B00005JLF2,"I can appreciate the general approval of 24; the action moves quickly and the viewer is left wondering and eagerly waiting for what comes next and the characters are attractive (i.e., it is easy to relate to them).  But for me it is all a little bit too much; there are too many plot twists, too much action to be believable, and the problem with the main character that in his strong sense of what is right and his readiness to act always in accord with his own certainty, he can hardly comprehend being wrong and, for a government agent, does not have the proper appreciation for due process and procedures developed over long experience to be quite the sort of hero I, at least, would want.  There is too much of certainty and not enough of nuance and genuine mystery.  I was, and you also might be, almost on the edge of your seat, but probably not quite.",1402358400,,859,4.389937106918239

There's a formula that they never stray from ... Jack's always in trouble with the management of his own organization, he's captured at least once, there's at least one woman in distress that he needs to save, there are at least two characters (and sometimes more) who are seemingly on Jack's side but are revealed at different times to be working against him, and I know I'm forgetting some.  Having said all that, it is kinda nameless fun, if only to appreciate the ludicrous twists and turns and how he miraculously traverses all of them.",1402185600,,713,4.650793650793651

1505168,2,B00005JLF2,"I had some hopes for this series, but it is another formula deal with a guy who ""acts"" in the lead role. Too much of that American desire to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, and a thin, weak storyline that gets thinner and weaker as the writers evidently run out of imagination. I would love to be a fly on the wall as the writers bandy ideas about, finally resorting to stealing ideas from old movies and other genres. I made it all the way to the 4th episode before I could take no more. That channel select button sure comes in handy at those times!

My advice to potential viewers is - if there is literally nothing else to watch, then this is passable as an extremely formula and unimaginative series. It has predictable viewing, weak plots, and a weaker cast. Leave it alone; if no one watches, they might cancel it and hold out for a product that actually works.",1402099200,,877,4.315151515151515

When I found the series on Amazon Prime I immediately started watching Season 1 which I managed to finish over the weekend.  During the week I finished Season 2 and now I am watching Season 3.

The writers of this show are amazing!!!  Now I know why my niece always wanted the entire season on DVD each Christmas.

Love Keifer Sutherland (Jack Bauer), President Palmer, and everyone on this show.

If you missed it or even if you saw it before, watch it again.  It's a show that shouldn't not be missed.

Highly recommend watching it!",1402099200,,735,4.338235294117647

Ok to be politically correct - its clue-impaired.

1505173,3,B00005JLF2,"Totally gripping -- I binge watched over the course of a week, 3 and 4 a night, and the ending was a 5-star ending.  But, in the light of day, the story is implausible -- not the main story which deals with foiling an assassination attempt, but the subplots.  That many capture-rescue, capture-rescue, capture-rescue events  in a 24 hour period strain all credulity.  Nor can folks function at top level on no sleep.  Nor can that much killing and trauma take place without leaving serious effects on characters.

1505484,5,B00005JLF2,"When they brought Season 9 to TV, I started watching the first episode, only to find that my wife also wanted to watch it. The problem? She'd never seen 24 before. All 8 seasons were a mystery to her!

Obviously I couldn't let her start with Season 9, her first impression of the legendary Jack Bauer being that of a ""terrorist"" wanted by the U.S. Government. I mean, how did we get there? Is Jack Bauer not a hero?

So, the only option was to go back through and re-watch all 8 seasons with my wife, re-living the world of Bauer and CTU, Tony Almeda and George Meiers and of course, Terri & Kim Bauer and the notorious Nina!

We watched Season 1 in just a few day's time, blowing through episode after episode at night before bed. We are now 6 episodes away from the end of Season 2 as I write this and I predict that -  at this rate - we should be able to use the July 4th weekend to marathon Season 8 and get started on Season 9 via DVR'ed episodes immediately following! (What a life!)

I'm just happy that Amazon has these, (Netflix did not), and better still, they're FREE for Prine Members! Just another reason why the Prime membership is worth every penny!!

1505556,4,B00005JLF2,"I originally watched this several years ago, but my wife had never seen it so we watched the whole first season when it became available on Amazon. The pacing is intense, and there are few if any moments where the story line drags, which makes sense when the primary narrative device is that ""events happen in real time"" over a 24-hr period.

Like all fictional accounts, the viewer must engage in a willing suspension of disbelief to become engaged in the story. 24 mostly allows the viewer to do so, but occasionally the plot twists and character developments are unbelievable even within the extraordinarily convoluted plot of the series.

Most of the casting decisions were spot-on, though the main character is a hard sell at first as an ex-Special Ops Counter Terrorist super agent. The acting throughout is mostly very good.

Certainly imminently enjoyable, it's hard to not watch ""just one more"" episode, and we're looking forward to watching Season 2.",1401753600,,960,4.950310559006211
1505557,5,B00005JLF2,It's been so many years since I have watched this show. I had forgotten what it was like having a cliffhanger at the end of every show. Not the end of the season but every show. So enjoying watching Jack again!!,1401753600,,211,4.170731707317073
1505558,5,B00005JLF2,Love it! I'm glad for another season. Acting is fantastic. I was wondering how they would start back up after a 4 year break. Brilliant.,1401753600,,136,4.48

1505699,5,B00005JLF2,"Initially I thought everything was given away in the season promo.  So glad I was wrong and now, I'm hooked.  Skip one episode and I find myself going back asking ""what brought that about?"".  Good acting, rational story line, with believable characters.  Not for the paranoid or faint of heart.  The show plays out like a well written novel of Tom Clancy style with a touch of Micheal Bay action and a pinch of Lieutenant Columbo ""Oh, just one other ting"", for good measure.  Warning, some scenes may cause awareness of your heart beating in real-time, dislodged in your throat, and fill you with the rush of anticipation of ""OMG, What next!"".

It's good to find intriguing entertainment drawn on the borderline of modern day news with hopefully a fictional twist.  Highly enjoyable, You might want to start from episode one otherwise it's like opening a good book in the middle and you'll find yourself  befuddled.  Got a few minutes?  Get lost in the events of '24'.  After all, it's only one day, 24-Hours, what could possibly happen?",1401667200,,1037,4.764044943820225

1505703,4,B00005JLF2,But the more I watched it the more it the more I wanted to see and it was always turning in a different direction.  Just when you think someone is safe something else happens.  The ending was a real shocker.  Some of the characters you actually end up hating them because of their actions but and then you root for the good guy when things all work out great.,1401667200,,359,4.173913043478261

1505830,3,B00005JLF2,"Using this mainly for a distraction while ironing, I am finding it engaging but a bit over-the-top.  The format is clever for t.v., with each episode representing 24 hours and segmented for commercial breaks, so there is a predictable rise-and-fall to the action.  Some characters are brilliantly acted; others are less so, without naming names.  The series' chief defect, in my opinion is its outrageous implausibility.  But as entertainment in the action/thriller genre, with some political, family, and social drama, it is engaging.",1401494400,,535,5.409638554216867

Happy, mad, ticked off, suspicious, dreading to watch the next scene, covering your eyes-but peeking between your fingers, pulling for the good guys, hating and wanting to kill the bad guys, we felt all of these emotions and many others! One amazing thing about this show is that you are watching one twenty-four hour day in the life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer! The entire 24 episodes is shown one hour at a time per show! Honestly, this show and its superb actors are like riding a roller coaster. It is fun and exciting and you can hardly wait to watch the next episode! Watch this show and enjoy the ride""",1401408000,,1104,4.525

1506061,4,B00005JLF2,"Twenty-four Hours (24) is a fast-moving thriller with excellent acting. Each episode encompasses one hour (real time) and each season has 24 episodes to make one full day of dramatic events. Ordinarily I would have chosen a 5-star rating, but Season 2 has a subplot that feels like an intrusion. Jack Bauer has a daughter who is kidnapped by terrorists ""bad"" guys in Season One. Her mother joins her as a kidnapped victim. The way the two are able to escape is believable. However, in Season 2 which takes place a year later, the actions that befall Kim Bauer, the daughter of Jack Bauer (the super hero) are so outlandish that one is annoyed at the utter stupidity of the subplot. This little girl Kim is involved in murder after murder, but manages to escape fairly unscathed each time. The ridiculous events involving Jack Bauer's daughter Kim spoil the main plot of political subterfuge and dramatic tension that keeps one glued to each episode.

Now, Jack Bauer, the rogue agent and good guy, is like Captain America. Jack is a superhero of the best sort. If you enjoy the Marvel comic books, you will really enjoy this series.  Now it's more realistic than Captain America and it holds true with likely present-day occurrences, but one has to accept that no one but a superhero can survive all the trials and tribulations experienced by Jack Bauer. In the second season, Jack is literally brought back from the dead, as in the return of Captain America from his frozen state.

Another good-guy character is the director of the Counter Intelligence Unit, Tony Almeida; and, of course, President David Palmer. The acting is tense and spellbinding. Each season (24 episodes) takes place in one day, an intriguing concept. One is completely caught up in the tension of the drama. As I have mentioned, my rating would have been 5 stars if the Kim Bauer subplot had not been so ridiculous and absurd. This subplot hinders the suspension of disbelief.

In the third season, the story begins 3 years later. I have not started Season 3 yet, but I will. Truly, I am a fan of Jack Bauer.",1401321600,,2082,4.711538461538462

Creative and refreshing to be able to watch a continuing story line as it happens.  The story is not resolved in a 1 hour episode but takes a whole season to complete one day.

The only thing is you have to be patient with the first couple of episodes because it then when the plot line is being built.

Keifer Sutherland plays the dynamic role of Federal Agent Jack Bauer who lays it all on the line for his service to the country and as I have seen through the seasons, no one else could have fitted this role better. I wasn't a big fan of Keifer but after seeing 24 I have a whole new level of respect for this man. He's a great actor and his portrayal of Jack Bauer can keep anybody glued to the TV set with the thought,""What's gonna happen next??"" If you are looking for something to keep you at the edge of your seat, 24 is it.",1400976000,,702,3.8819444444444446

1506608,5,B00005JLF2,"If you like realistic law enforcement TV shows that keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next, then you need to watch this series.  This show is shot from several different viewpoints, making it extremely interesting and thought-provoking as well.  Give it a try!",1400976000,,287,4.836734693877551
1506609,4,B00005JLF2,"There are a few TV series that I had not watched on purpose, so I could watch later. Now that I have Fire TV I can watch all the episodes back to back to back. 24 when watched a few episodes at one sitting is as good as a thrill ride at a theme park. When I finish 24 there are a couple of other series I'll watch for the 1st time like Justified.
Warning! If watching on Fire TV be careful navigating toward watching free on Amazon Prime. It is set up to be easy to click on the wrong spot and you'll end up paying for that episode or worse yet the whole season. I'm sure it was set up this way on purpose to nab as many unaware viewers to pay accidentally.",1400976000,,657,3.8740740740740742
1506610,2,B00005JLF2,"I really wanted to like this, I watched almost all of the season, but I found some of the characters unbelievably dense and it irritated me. Maybe I'm picky, but if I was told NOT to do something and I did it anyway then drastic and violent things occurred as a result, the next time I would be more apt to listen and do as I was told....not so with, for instance, the daughter.  That character constantly and consistently did the opposite of anything she was told to do or not do.",1400976000,,481,4.228260869565218

Then the girl just gets out of surgery where her heart stops and she is in a room in an ICU unit with a door that closes so no nurses can watch her, oh and let's not leave out the fact that the monitor isn't connected to the nurses station so that the fake dad can smother her.

I checked online to access  Previous seasons  and they are not available on other streaming companies and if they are you have to pay extra per episode. I take advantage of my Prime membership because I am able to catch up without paying extra for each episode just my annual Prime membership.
You cant beat that with a stick.

I was expecting action packed 4 hours (4 episodes), then 16 blah episodes with lackluster story and action, and then action pickup for finale (last 4 episodes). It had a few stale moments, but those plot twists captured my attention and made me choose to not wait for the next episode and watch the next one anyway. Great first season.

I had never seen 24 so I started a marathon watching on Prime in order to be able to understand the new series 24.  After the first 6 segments of season one,  I think it would be better for me to watch it non-marathon.  It was torturous to watch and when I realized that there were 24 segments shown for 8 seasons, I decided not to be tortured or put that  much time into the series.  I guess I can watch 1 per week but it will be 3 years to see the whole thing.

The action is intense, the plot intriguing, the suspense is nail-biting.  And all this is done without the onslaught of bad language commonly found in TV shows today.  I highly recommend this show!",1400630400,,319,4.389830508474576
1507225,5,B00005JLF2,"I decided to watch all the 24 seasons over again to get ready for the current season, It was definitely worth it. It would be too much writing to explain what makes this series better than most. Jack is what it's all about!",1400630400,,223,4.209302325581396

1507228,5,B00005JLF2,"This is one of the best written TV shows that I've ever seen. Unlike the common shallow, comic book style, plots that most TV writers churn out this series has the kind of complex plotlines that you associate with a well written novel. The development of the characters and reveals of their inmost character is very well done.

The result is a very believable set of characters who in large measure represent everyman/woman in the American mileau. ...and the nail biting cliffhangers at the end of each episode keep you coming back.",1400630400,,532,4.782608695652174

1507288,4,B00005JLF2,"Have made it up to Episode 16 of Season 1 and, of note so far: Bauer's wife and daughter come across as maddeningly stupid people. I keep hoping they just get killed off. I think they are supposed to make one like the Bauer character as family man, as clever badass because he saves them (despite them repeatedly), etc., but they really do not inspire any sympathy or positive leanings, just annoyance.

Show made it 8 seasons and is back with new season now, so hopefully gets much better.",1400544000,,490,4.50561797752809

and each episode has you on edge that I can't wait to see the next episode.  What I love most of all is that I don't have to wait from week to week to see what happens next.

Much like a mesmerizing book once I checked out episode 1, I could not stop watching.  I watched a marathon over the weekend shocked at how much better this show is than most.

1508034,4,B00005JLF2,I like the continuous action that 24 provides. It captivates my attention. Even though I've seen it before it still keeps you glued to my chair. I love that I can go from one episode to the next without waiting till next week.,1400112000,,226,4.27906976744186
1508035,5,B00005JLF2,"There are shows that tried to imitate this pioneering series, but none succeeded. Even a dozen years later, the show has staying power.  The production quality, acting and suspense were held throughout the season. Well worth watching a second time.",1400112000,,248,5.2
1508036,3,B00005JLF2,"This series has a tempo similar to the Spooks (MI-5) British series but the adaptation is not successful.  The intent is to cover 1 day (24 hrs.) in the life of Bauer (the main character) who is part of a counter terrorism government organization, with assorted subplots involving other characters.  One episode = 1hr, consequently, all plots move slowly and are subjected to different kinds of complications for entertainment purposes. The plots introduced in Episode 1 get resolved several episodes later requiring a big investment of time on the part of the viewer to bring closure to the various stories.  I prefer the MI-5 format with, essentially, one plot per episode.  Bauer's opponents are a bit demonized in their portrayal, looking more like James Bond's bad guys than real human beings. Bauer's stamina and abilities appear at times superhuman.  Watch these programs when you want to be simply entertained.",1400112000,,918,5.134228187919463

1508116,4,B00005JLF2,Fun show to watch but when all the episodes are available at once you tend to stay up way too late! Nothing deep here but the plots are fun with unpredictable twists and turns.  If you missed this back in 2002 it's worth a watch.,1400112000,,229,4.088888888888889

1508120,4,B00005JLF2,"This was a good TV crime drama. Keffer Sutherland plays the part well, however some of the acting is a little (loose for lack of a better word). One can see through the acting in some cases and it makes one remember that it is an actor playing a part instead of watching a seamless plot. But for the most part it is well worth watching. I'm watching it now because I didn't watch it when it first aired and I wanted to get a background perspective before I watched the current episodes.",1400112000,,486,4.236559139784946
1508121,3,B00005JLF2,"This season can be distilled into 1 line - all the world's problems are from b!+chy wives and misbehaving children. It seems that had it not been for one stupid thing after another being done by Jack's daughter and senator's son, and nagging wives (of both), the story could play out in a single episode.

The dialogue is plain silly - just count the number of ""are you OK?""'s uttered when the asker clearly should have known the other person was not OK (there should be something more meaningful to ask), or ""I promise"", when there was no way they could make that promise.

More importantly, it seems that the final plot twist (the last traitor) does not jive with the earlier episodes. If that person was really a traitor, Jack's machinations should have come out sooner. Some other details are questionable - Jack can take on a platoon of soldiers, but can't overcome a long-imprisoned old man and his son in hand-to-hand combat. Or when the old man is being moved WITHOUT HANDCUFFS? Makes no sense to me, sorry.

Still, it watches with interest, and though characters are not compelling and their dialogue is plain silly, I was eager to watch the next episodes, just to see how the story resolves itself (as well as count how many times the characters would say ""I promise""). Hence 3 stars.",1400112000,,1294,4.641921397379913

I think this series should say as a by line that US Presidents should never spend 24 hours in Los Angeles. I am glad Fox is returning the show but now in Great Britain, maybe US Presidents should stay out of the Country where Jack is located.
I give this series Five Stars Plus, great to watch without commercials.",1400112000,,512,4.23469387755102

1508650,4,B00005JLF2,This show leaves you wanting to watch the next episode immediately.  Not sure how people waited a whole week in between episodes when this was on TV.  Some of the things that happen (especially to Kim) leave you wondering what kind person do you have to be to have this much bad luck.  But I couldn't stop watching anyway.  Will recommend this to others to watch if they have not seen it.,1399852800,,388,4.347222222222222
1508651,4,B00005JLF2,"Suspenseful story line but it seems like a stretch at some points, like a presidential candidate spending almost the entire Election Day in a hotel room instead of on camera.

In fact I have to wait for an episode to end to get a drink of water or a meal, but seriously it is an intriguing mystery filled with many twists and subplots.

1508916,3,B00005JLF2,"The show is okay....

24 has a lot of plot holes to keep the story moving forward, but one can't expect too much from a tv show.

Basically you'll just have to be comfortable with rolling your eyes a couple times an episode, but it's good cheap entertainment.

Honestly though, I don't understand why people gush over this show.  It's ok, but not a masterpiece.",1399766400,,361,4.507692307692308

1508920,4,B00005JLF2,"I'm currently re-watching the original series. It was intriguing now as it was then. I liked this first new episode because it has some of the original actors and it picks up where it ended.  This series always gets the balance of adventure, mystery and interpersonal relationships right. There are enough cliff hangers to keep you on the edge of your seat because you are invested in the characters. I think that is a unique ability in today's psyche. Thanks for keeping it close to the original.",1399766400,,497,4.712643678160919

1509030,5,B00005JLF2,"I still remember watching season one of 24 years many ago. A friend and I used to call each other during every commercial break saying some variation of, ""did you SEE that!! I can't believe what just HAPPENED!!"" Even after repeated viewings, it's still an incredibly fun ride. I even managed to get my bf, who had never seen a single episode, hooked on the show 10 years after it first aired. Let me be clear... you aren't going to learn anything meaningful or have some artistic epiphany by watching this show. It's just the best, all-American action movie you've ever seen spread out over 24 episodes. Car chases, kidnappings, and explosions are sprinkled with an international crime family, a presidential primary, government corruption, secret agents and more twists and turns than you can count. This is a series that's made for sitting in front of the tv with your buddies over a bowl of popcorn, while you scream at the television and laugh out loud at the mishaps the hero and his family face over the course of the day.",1399766400,,1028,4.685082872928176

All the govt employees in the show reflect lots of politics, lots of levels of bureaucrats to contend with, and lots of screw ups (so it is very realistic).
All the actors were pretty good. If you get involved in the story, you can get upset when Jack's daughter starts to screw thing up when she falls and gets concerned for the guy who kidnapped her (kinda ridiculous). She even tries to lecture him that he could do better. All in all, compared to other shows, this is good stuff.",1399680000,,632,4.188524590163935

1509671,2,B00005JLF2,"I wish I had watched this show years ago when it premiered. Perhaps because it's 12 years old, the first season's plot turns were stale and almost juvenile.  I found myself rolling my eyes the way one does watching teen slasher movies (nobody is ever as clueless as the characters in horror movies).  Unfortunately, they are in ""24"". By the sixth episode or so, most of the characters are hopelessly  irritating and dim-witted. I had to wonder how David Palmer could have gotten as far as he had in politics, and still be so nave about the players and their games. How did his wife become a conniving, overly ambitious Svengali overnight?  Why does Kiefer Sutherland have to stage whisper his dialog? It's like fingernails on a chalkboard. How could Jack Bauer have every phone number of every character in his memory...even those of strangers?  He never uses speed dial or information. The same with his daughter...she calls CTU from a police car and her mother magically picks up the phone.  What's up with this powerful crime family having dozens of hired guns who can't hit the side of a barn, much less the Bauer family all galumphing around the woods?  By the end of the season, Jack's wife has become so insufferable that her demise was a refreshing relief....anything to stop her whining. No more ""24"" for me. One season was more than enough.",1399420800,,1350,4.719148936170213

I watch this to relax and be entertained by excitement and the adventure of the story. It's also one of the series of the sort that is available so that you can follow a whole series without breaks, delays, and other frustrating interruptions that make one decide to switch to something else.

For some it might be over the top action with no breaks and no humor. Basically, that's a fair assessment, but for 45 minutes, that's what I want.

So, watch it once and you'll get the general theme of the series, but the unfoldment hour to hour over the 24 hours of the series - hence its name - will keep you coming back for the ""next exciting episode"". Your tastes and emotions at that moment will quickly let you know if it's for you. Or not.

1509923,4,B00005JLF2,"With Kieffer Sutherland set to reprise his role at Jack Bauer in 24: Live Another Day, I decided to revisit the series, rewatching all eight seasons prior to the May 5, 2014 premiere.  Although over a dozen years have passed, with its ""real time"" format, the groundbreaking first season of 24 still remains a very engaging, exciting and impactful drama, establishing a mold for the seasons to come, and severing as an example for many other productions to follow.  Although there are a few slow spots, the focus is predominantly on action, as 24 is an extended thrill ride, rife with plot twists, and threats to the nation on a grand scale, involving players at the highest levels of government.  Heavy spoilers follow, so the uninitiated are forewarned.

Premiering in the fall of 2001, 24 follows in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack, as Jack Bauer, the head of the Los Angeles branch of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) attempts to deal with a sophisticated plot to assassinate Presidential candidate David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unit/dp/B002G1WPHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unit</a>), that also threatens the lives of Bauer's wife Teri (Leslie Hope), and daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Next-Door/dp/B0029XFN8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Next Door</a>).

Utilizing satellite feeds and traffic cameras, CTU is an agency capable of great technical expertise, but with some very questionable security practices, CTU also suffers from incompetence, power plays, turf wars, and is frequently  infiltrated by terrorists, traitors, and moles.

Facing devious opposition with plans in motion at several levels, and often hampered by staff with hidden motives, making progress is never easy for Bauer and CTU, as success is usually followed by complications, and another threat.  Even those who are loyal, are coerced into aiding terrorists, to save their loved ones.  With new players often appearing in the mix, emotions ebb and flow throughout the ""real time"" of each hourly episode, which typically concludes on a cliffhanger.  In a pattern that would be repeated, the story arc of Season One, is roughly divided into three acts.

A youthful and blondish Kieffer Sutherland quickly establishes himself as Bauer, a caring husband and father, dedicated to his job.  Bauer's determination, explosively violent behavior, tolerance for pain, and propensity for employing intimidation and torture, would soon reshape primetime TV.

24 features a tremendous supporting and guest cast, including Carlos Bernard, Sarah Clarke, Penny Johnson Jerald, Glenn Morshower, Mia Kirshner, Dennis Hopper, Jude Ciccolella, and Leslie Hope.  Rarely does an actor have the presence and statue to elevate a series, the way that Dennis Haysbert does as David Palmer.  The special relationship that develops between Haysbert and Sutherland, would continue to be one of the cornerstones of the series, into the second and third seasons.

24 isn't always very credible, but it is extremely entertaining, and can easily be quite addictive.  The series would ascend to greater heights in succeeding seasons, and while a bit unpolished, Season One is definitely not to be missed.  For dedicated fans, the numerous extras available on DVD, make the set a recommended purchase, particularly as the cost has now fallen to bargain levels.  It is a little baffling that after all this time, only the seventh and eighth seasons are available on Bluray.",1399161600,,3593,5.669776119402985

1510006,4,B00005JLF2,"I can't believe I had never seen the series, being that it started just as I graduated from high school.  The premises of the show is tactful. My only annoyance was the repetitive hostage occurrences of the mother and daughter.  However, even the show portrayed that through characters as well.  I can understand being scared and feeling helpless on perhaps the first 2 abductions, but by the 3 or fourth 4, I was glad that the characters showed either annoyance or anger, and then the need to finally fight back.

It is also a relief to know that one problem portrayed in an episode was carried out through the series for resolution. Then again each season is supposed to be an estimate of 24 hours.",1399161600,,700,4.576

1510181,5,B00005JLF2,"I work in a large warehouse.  Towards the end of the first season of ""24"" I kept hearing a lot of the guys at work talking about it.  At the beginning of the fall ( I guess the fall of 2001 ) I saw that Amazon had season one for sale. Given I had never bought any TV series before I thought it might be nice to have something I could watch for less than an hour if I had just a bit of time before bed.  About a week after buying it I sat down and started to watch the very beginning, my wife came in and asked what I was watching.  I told her, she asked what it was about and who starred in it...I wasn't really sure what the plot was but gave her a rough idea.  Then I told her who starred in it and she said "" I don't like him"" and walked out of the room. About a week after that I was watching episode # 5 or so in bed and my wife crawled into bed....started watching and she was hooked....Every season from then on we had to watch every episode on TV and then buy each season on DVD.  Season 1 was the best but all the rest are very good too.",1398902400,,1046,3.731818181818182

1510254,5,B00005JLF2,"The television series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. The first season corresponds to a single 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer of the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU. Each episode represents a single hour in this very action-packed and eventful day. The character of agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to thwart the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This first season of ""24"" is intelligent, fast-paced, and extremely suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The continual intrigue and multiple plot twists keep the viewer totally engaged, because one never really knows who can be trusted. The amazing series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give Season 1 my very highest recommendation!",1398816000,,1333,5.53921568627451

1510637,2,B00005JLF2,"To me, a show cannot be suspenseful if events don't feel natural. If the invisible hand of the writers is present in every episode of the season, we already know the biggest spoiler of all: the show has writers. These writers want people to keep watching the show, so they will make every episode as suspenseful as possible. If you KNOW there will be suspense, the suspense is no longer suspenseful, because it's expected. In 24, the pen truly is mightier than the sword (and terrorists, and bombs, and logic/reason, and physics, etc.).

Jack won't die; we know this. So when someone holds a gun to Jack's head, we think, ""Well, he's going to get out of this somehow."" Jack won't stay in the same place for one hour without saving the real-time day, so if things look calm for him, it's going to get bad very soon.

More signs that the show is written. Basically no one talks about how tired they are, even though everyone has been up for 36 hours or so. Multiple times, backup will take half an episode or more to get somewhere, but then the characters will get back to base between episodes (so, in zero seconds). Everyone gets kidnapped pretty much constantly, and it is not always the same people doing the kidnapping.

But my biggest complaint, by far, is that there are good guys and bad guys. (If a character was born outside the U.S., there's basically a 100% chance that they fall in the bad guy category.) No one is really grey, and grey characters are, of course, the most interesting because we live in a grey world. 24 is a show to watch if you want to escape reality for a while. Where you ask, ""Are they good or bad?"" and you might not know the answer yet, but at least you know there IS an answer.

Well sorry 24, but I don't like turning my brain off when I watch TV. I want shows I watch to resonate with me after I've finished them. I want shows to challenge my beliefs, or to make me think deeply, or to present me with interesting analogies. I don't care if any of your characters die, because they are obviously not real people. I know you think we can stay together for another week, 24, but that's just not going to happen.",1398556800,5,2147,4.36

1510644,5,B00005JLF2,It's been a lot of fun watching STNG reruns from the first season on.  It still holds up as science fiction.  I'm enjoying it a lot.,1398556800,,132,4.038461538461538
1510645,4,B00005JLF2,Can't stop watching it. Wish the series were continuing with the same cast. Best suspense series I have ever watched.,1398556800,,117,4.9

1510732,2,B00005JLF2,"Completely ridiculous yet somehow satisfying to watch. Writing is horrendous. It it's difficult to justify, let alone recommend it to others, but I watched and I might watch the next season too because I have a lot of free time.",1398470400,,228,4.725

1510734,5,B00005JLF2,"I love action and spy thrillers. Where on earth was I when ""24"" began airing?! I am still watching season 1, spellbound and hooked.

The format is astounding; forcing the viewer to pay very close attention to the plot and various intertwining sub-plots. Mr. Sutherland represents Agent Bower effectively. You feel his stress and wonder how you would handle his predicament. ""24"" rocks!!",1398470400,,386,5.126984126984127

1510738,5,B00005JLF2,"Great choice for the president!
I love the concept of creating a series for a season that only covers one day; yet, a complete year goes by before the next day is experienced. Applause given to the writer for his creativity, and to the director for his insight. As always we give thanks to the actors for their willingness to deliver and for their skills in getting the job done with purpose.",1398470400,,392,4.458333333333333

1510741,5,B00005JLF2,"I did see adverts for this show, but I think something else conflicted with the time. This is SUCH a good show to binge watch! I'm ready to DVR the upcoming 9th season so I don't have to wait for it to come out streaming. :-)",1398470400,,225,3.9130434782608696

1510898,3,B00005JLF2,"Too many preposterous twists and turns to be able to suspend belief. Still, it moves pretty well, and everyone looks beautiful. When the action stops, the dialogue between characters is trite, hackneyed, and makes want to slap my head. If Season 2 is more of the same, I'm bailing. We'll see.",1398384000,,292,4.745098039215686

1510962,5,B00005JLF2,"This one is the one to watch There are so many great twists. George Mason begins his evolution as a character that lasts to the end of the run...
The only actor I never liked in this show was Jack's Wife Terri... Just didn't like her demeanor.
There are just enough side stories in the first episode alone to make it a real cliffhanger on so many levels..Kim gets in trouble, Rick changes, Alan York is revealed, George the hard ass comes around...  And the season? You gain trust for the characters you believe have been wrongly vilified, and are shocked by the characters you liked.

Tony... NINA!!! come on... the stars aligned for this one.,.
The way that President Palmer comes to defy all of the people he was trusting and is brought together with Jack whom he does trust against all advice and  with whom he has a past connection that neither are aware of, is masterful storytelling.. The plot of the season centers around revenge. you find out before the characters do and that adds to the nail biting..

Some great lines of Dialogue! One of our favorites is between Dan and Ira, the ""Bad Guy Boss""...

Dan Mounts: We'd like our money now. If that's like, you know, okay.
Ira Gaines: Well, just so we're like, you know, clear, what happened to the other girl?
Dan Mounts: Janet? Like I told you, we had to kill her.
Ira Gaines: 'Cause my people tell me that someone that fits her description was taken to a hospital near to where you were. How do you explain that?
(Pause)
Dan Mounts: Well, the thing is that...maybe she wasn't quite dead.
Ira Gaines: Well, I'll tell ya, Dan. You're either dead or you're not dead. There's no such thing as ""sorta dead"". Here, let me show you. (pulls out gun and shoots Dan)

Watch it....",1398297600,,1730,4.476190476190476

1510964,2,B00005JLF2,"I don't know if it's because this is 12 years old or if I just watch too closely but it seems for a top spy organization they make a lot of blunders.  For example, they have triple security on family members and they just walk out or have cell phones to call who ever they want.  A one point, one of the bad guys kills 4 or 5 agents then acts intimidated by one security guard.",1398297600,2,377,3.9473684210526314

1510966,3,B00005JLF2,"I remember when this season first aired on TV. We were hooked. Watching it again now reminds me that I liked the later seasons better. It seemed like they scaled back on the mature subject matter and sexual situations in the later seasons (while cranking up the violence which we did not mind as much since it usually made Jack seem that much more awesome).

24 overall was a groundbreaking show. Glad to hear they're bringing it back for another season May 2014! As long as you know what you're getting into you may enjoy season 1.",1398297600,,532,4.484536082474227

1511052,5,B00005JLF2,This is where it all started. I remember friends and families who couldn't wait to get home to watch it. No DVR in those days! People everywhere talked about the show from one week to the next. It is great to own the whole season so there is no week to wait to see what happens. Very suspenseful and also patriotic.,1398211200,,315,4.180327868852459

1511054,5,B00005JLF2,"I tried watching this series when it was on the air but it was just too slow for my tastes.  Streaming seems to be perfect.  I do have to say, I am so happy I don't live their lives.  If all of this could actually happen to the same group of people in 24 hours, I would never leave the house.  I guess to make this show attention worthy on air, the drama is super-hyped so watching it streaming almost makes it funny that so much could happen in such a short time.  Good season no less though.",1398211200,,493,3.989795918367347

More things happened that made absolutely no sense than could possibly happen to these characters in a 24 hour period.  Totally ridiculous and ALL of the women in the series were lame, stupid, asinine. Will not be watching the rest of the seasons.

Well, we did decide to see if people were right that Season 2 was better.  We watched.  Still way over the top in stupidity.",1398211200,,458,4.536585365853658
1511056,3,B00005JLF2,Episode 1 was good. A lot of action and great without the commercial breaks. It does make you want to follow the next episodes to find out what happened.,1398211200,,153,4.310344827586207

1511136,4,B00005JLF2,Amazon Instant Video is pretty nice. Had a couple of streaming issues but not many. I like the show minus the obvious departure from the real world. I guess Hollywood feels compelled to embellish. We will certainly watch more seasons on Amazon.,1398124800,,244,4.833333333333333

1511518,3,B00005JLF2,"The show's initial episodes are exciting and well laid out; however, as the episodes progress, they become flaky.  Specifically, without giving too much away, what happens in one episode doesn't support what happens in another and the ending is completely whacked in two ways.  That said, I'm not sure I'll watch season 2.",1397779200,,322,5.056603773584905

1511767,4,B00005JLF2,My husband and I decided to start watching 24 since there is a new season coming out soon.  We are over halfway through the first season and are truly enjoying it.  My only complaint is that at times I feel like the acting is pretty bad - I'm guessing that it potentially gets better as the seasons continue.  But overall we really like the show and are becoming pretty hooked!,1397606400,,377,4.357142857142857

1511775,2,B00005JLF2,"Considering the hype and attention this series received as well as the skills of cast and crew,  I had high hopes that it would be an exciting show to watch while waiting for current shows seasons to start anew.  Sad to say it was not worth the hour out of my 24 and most likely not yours either.  The technology utilized for the espionage and capers by both the 'good and bad guys' was unrealistic.  High school thespians do better portrayals of characters than many of the experienced cast. Scenarios were contrived and extended to fit the one hour time slot.  Many settings were dark -how would they have done their work without the glow of their computer monitors? This show drags through the scenarios, to fill up the hour. Hope the 2014 show is better.",1397520000,,758,4.544117647058823
1511876,5,B00005JLF2,"I am currently re-watching the entire series from the beginning and must say the show has aged really well.

Yes, there are many clichs, and often the same tips and tricks are used to surprise us. Ultimately, the characters like Jack or Chloe are the ones that make us stick to the show. And great villains, too.

Jack Bauer was a singular character in TV in the same way Jason Bourne is for movies. Their ability to kickass is always completely believable. Not like Freddie Prinze Jr.",1397520000,,485,4.563218390804598

1511884,4,B00005JLF2,24 with Jack Bauer is incredible. If you love cliff hangers you'll love this mystery action thriller based showed with the awesome Jack Bauer (Keither Sutherland).

1512002,3,B00005JLF2,"I must say that I started to get interested in this show a day or so before the show started after hearing a conversation on the radio about the buzz of the action, writing, cast and real time format of the show and I've loved it since the pilot aired!!! The fact that it is not in HD is baffling? It may be OK if you have 27inch tube TV, but even with a modest Samsung 40inch LCD the picture quality is very poor. Almost resembles the quality of a VHS tape. It's great that we get Seasons 7 & 8 in HD, but WHY DOES IT SAY THAT YOU HAVE SEASONS 1,4,5 & 6 IN HD? MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE SERIES IN HD? It's 1 of the series ever on TV....you have ridiculous shows like Hoarders, Pawn Stars & duck dynasty in HD, for some strange reason and not 24!!!!!!!! Whatever you need to do to make that happen, PLEASE DO IT!!!!",1397347200,,837,4.017964071856287

just as thrilling and heart pounding as the last season was. We are looking
forward to Action Packed Nights on our Kindle Fire TV.

i never watched it when it was on wish i would have gotten over my dislike of the main actor sooner
first thing i liked the younger sutherland in was touch and that made me rethink my thoughts on whether or not to watch this show , I am glad I did because it is very addictive , fast paced lots of twists , pay attention to everything or you will miss something

its an interesting show don't pay attention to the obvious fake information like the fake CTU division of the government

for a government agency that is counter yes COUNTER terrorism , they sure do have alot of people infiltrate them and plant things in the buildings on their computers etc
even for a fake agency this happens way too much, every season by the way",1396915200,,752,4.251748251748252

1512640,5,B00005JLF2,I'm on episode 12 of season one and the suspense that permeates every minute of every episode is unnerving.  It is as if the writers sat down and made a list of roadblocks and obstacles they could constantly use to confront Agent Bower and make this day in his life a living hell.  If he didn't have bad luck he wouldn't have any luck at all.  I have to have faith though that the good guy will win in the end.  Stay tuned.,1396828800,,423,4.0602409638554215

1512972,3,B00005JLF2,"finally got around to watching this series for the first time. always heard it was good but never had time. now it is free on amazon prime i figured i'd give it a go.

excellent action and suspense. nearly every episode ends on a cliffhanger which makes it really hard to put down after one episode. you care about characters and feel their pain and tension. timing is very well done and the plot twists are decent and unexpected, keeping you thinking.

the worst part are the girls. they are helpless, clueless, provincial girls. Jack's wife and daughter are the worst. they are constantly taken advantage of and constantly getting in trouble that they could potentially avoid. it gets a bit repetitive and makes watching the 2nd half a bit nauseating. true i am watching this in 2014 and this was made 10+ years ago. stereotypes have changed thankfully, and women are a more meaningful part of plots and stories now.

also kind of out of place is how low tech the cell phones/telephones are compared to the 2014 ones. the technology in season 1 is aging super fast and may eventually make this series unwatchable because of how unbelievably backwards the technology is.

overall though a fun and decent ride and gave me food for thought about a number of life issues.",1396483200,,1269,4.677130044843049

I like that Jack doesn't seem so invincible although in the end less so. He is a flawed character, unlike the superman type hero and I love this. Everybody, except Jack is expendable, and you get that feeling throughout the season. The one and only issue I had with this season the brought it down to, say a 4.5 was that the seemed to go to great lengths to conceals who the true villain was, which seemed kind of contrived when you looked at the whole series in retrospect, but who does that?",1396483200,,611,4.186440677966102

1513070,5,B00005JLF2,"When it aired, I started watching 24 in its 3rd or 4th season. My wife's raves forced me to give it a try and I was hooked. I recently watched seasons 3 -9  in HD on Amazon Prime Streaming and relived those fabulous shows. My HD snobbery stopped me from watching seasons 1-2 but I am happy I came to my senses. Very enjoyable and you see how the characters evolved from this point to later seasons (i.e. Tony, Milo, Jack, Kim). Kiefer looks maybe 20 years old when he was actually 34 in Season 1. I kind of liked the mature Jack in later seasons. Also, to my delight, the standard definition is pretty good.

After it was out for awhile and I heard alot of people discussing it,
it piqued my interest, but by that time, it was already out for awhile,
so I figured it was too late to start watching.
Years have gone by, and I recently saw it on Amazon Prime so decided to start
watching. I think I watched 3 episodes a night for the first couple of nights.
Very well written, (although there are some really stupid parts).
I'll hopefully finish season 1 in the next few days (my watching has tailed
off, as there are other life priorities to deal with).
If I have the time, I'll start season 2.

Each episode ends in a way that you can't not watch the next episode.  One thing I don't like is the way they made Kim's character so cold toward her dad.",1395532800,,305,3.7777777777777777

Arguments would say that someone wouldn't stay up 24 hours, but each season is a special day; a day that would warrant your time for 24 hours.  And even though you know Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) is the good guy hear, he gets to do some ""bad guy"" stuff-which Keifer plays so well.  Lots of twists and turns.  Lots of surprises.  Definitely worth the time.",1395273600,,466,4.238636363636363

1514071,5,B00005JLF2,"I remember when the series premiere come out I was so excited to watch it. However, I decided to go into labor that week..I never csught up with it because I thought I would be lost.
Now, watched all eight seasons in a row. Jack Bauer must be the love child of Jack Reacher (book version!) and Ethan Hunt...on steroids!  Can' wait until seas 9 starts this May.",1393804800,,360,4.294117647058823

1514075,3,B00005JLF2,"The complete first season of 24 came to me as a throw-in with two other series box sets I picked up in an eBay auction, so I gave it a watch.  I found it gripping and well written through the first rescue, despite plenty of gaffes in professional technique which were committed first if not better in the old Charlie's Angels series.  Then, they blew it by driving the show back into a new kidnap cycle which featured ever more deteriorating choices and eventually the spectacle of Bauer giving up his gun to save the warden's life.  Any trained professional (I'm a retired trained professional) would never give up his weapon under such circumstances.  Sure enough the warden was immediately shot.  Jack, you are an idiot; or, really the characters are the victims of idiotic writing in the afternoon and evening.  There are exceptions.  For example, I found Kim's jail cell scenes reasonable, and I liked the suspense of the ruse outside the bunker, outfitting the non-combatants with uniforms and equipment in the desperation attempt to fool the attackers (and it better be a desperation situation, because in real life you are going to be fired for that if you do survive!)  I liked Senator Palmer's confession speech.  They also used subtlety in moving along the potential relationship between speechwriter Patty and Palmer; Patty does a very nice job of being just a bit flirtatious, trying to work herself up to making a move, which she finally springs as a shoulder rub which Palmer just barely manages to resist.  In fact Palmer is the best actor in this set; he is completely believable as a presidential candidate trying to handle open conflicts in family and politics, and the threat to his own life, while also being very conflicted within himself as to which path of many branches to take.  His wife also pulls off the right combination of ambition and raw mother instinct, while gradually revealing that her husband is just the means to her ends.  The factotum who performs the dirty behind-the-scenes work was well acted too.  Overall, I don't regret watching it, but I'm not sure if I want to buy another season set.  So that seems to be a ""3 star"" rating.",1393718400,,2173,4.76
1514076,5,B00005JLF2,This series kept me on the edge of my seat with each episode.  The characters are believable and intense.  Although I have never been a fan of Kiefer Sutherlin...this show is changing my mind.  Glad it is available on Amazon.,1393632000,,225,4.575
1514143,5,B00005JLF2,"This show is Amazing, and I have been a fan ever since it first debuted back in 2001.  Keifer Sutherland did one Hell of a job in creating this masterpiece.  For people who have yet to see this, it still retains the same feel every time you watch it.  Once you start watching the first episode, you will be sucked into this Amazing show.  I can easily say that watching one episode at a time is just not enough.  The characters are interesting, the plot is very good, and the tension is just right.

There are so many OMG moments in each episode. To fill an entire show with just 1 hour in a specific day seems impossible but they carry it off impeccably. I wish my husband would stay up all night so we could watch more episodes but he does have to go to work.

1514487,5,B00005JLF2,"I'm probably one of the 2 people in the universe who didn't watch 24 when it was originally broadcast.  Now I find that I'm addicted to this amazing and suspense-filled series.  Have been watching piecemeal over the last year or so, usually when visiting a daughter whose hubby is equally addicted - we'll watch 4-5 episodes in an evening to satisfy the craving, but those episodes have been from later seasons.  This week, when my hubby was sick with a stomach bug, I took the opportunity to stage a 24 marathon, and crammed 19 episodes of season 1 into ONE evening.  Yeah, very little sleep that night...  Do NOT watch this series if you're not seeking nail-biting suspense - there's treachery, betrayal, pathos, feats of amazing endurance, and super-human devotion to duty, which of course is often stymied by governmental red tape and protocol...  Do NOT start watching unless you have hours to devote to it, because once you begin, it's extremely difficult to stop and not go to the next episode.  Do NOT watch unless you want your mind to race to anticipate the twists and turns of 2-3 plot lines running concurrently, unless you want to occasionally inhale sharply when those plots take a shocking turn, unless you want to be thoroughly captivated.  Oh well, you get the idea...",1392768000,,1285,4.782805429864253

We really think this is a well thought out drama and are really enjoying it.
If I had to say a con to this show it would be that it is really intense most of the time, no breaks from intensity for me means that I find myself completely tensed up at the end of the 42 minutes, wish it had some light moments every once in a while just to break the tension.

Usually I never will start a book in mid-series and feel pretty much that way about a television show.  So glad I made the exception--the earlier shows were as powerful as the later ones and a lot of the undertone of the later series has been filled in just by watching the first ones.  BEST of all [beyond the series itself]  NO commercials--you can just watch the show straight through.

How many times can the Senators annoying son get intense, upset or accused of murder in 24 hours? How many agents, valuable witnesses or bad guys be killed in 24 hours?

1514734,4,B00005JLF2,"Major latecomers to this series, we just started watching because we heard it's coming back for a limited run in March. The wife and I figured we'd leisurely glide through the season a few episodes at a time until we caught up. Ha! We wound up ripping through the first season in 4 days.  What! A! Show! I agree with the folks who say Kiefer must have been born for the role, and the episodes simply grab you and won't let you go. I will say that Tthe writers have made Elisha Cuthbert's character, Kim, the dumbest box of rocks I've seen on TV in years--and that even counts Penny from The Big Bang Theory. The decisions this chick makes seem like they are ripped directly from  ""Halloween"" or some other horror flick.  I hope she smartens up in future seasons. We just started Season 2 and it's looking really good... So far, I can see why it got rave reviews on IMDb. We must've been living in a cave when the original series ran.",1392422400,,933,4.32

1514867,4,B00005JLF2,"Season one starts out a little slow - and characters have a difficult time getting developed. However, by about episode 5 or so it should have you hooked.

In my opinion this is the most gripping of all the seasons of 24 - it adds more of a personal story with Jack his Wife and his Daughter.

This show belongs up there with the greats, its in my top 3 of best Dramas.",1392076800,,369,4.041095890410959

1514870,3,B00005JLF2,"One thing is true, once you start to view this first series you will be hooked for the entire first year's episodes. It grips from the beginning and keeps you involved as the plot develops. Unfortunately in later episodes it degenerates into more predictable plot variations of multiple deaths, an escape and a chase sequence each hour. As the first year's events unfold we get to know the characters more personally, each clearly drawn and consistent throughout the series almost to the end. Red herrings abound if you are trying to figure out the who what or why. Sorry to say, the last episodes progress without much creative or original thought (or credibility!) as the writers strain to stretch the story to cover the full 24 hours.",1391990400,,737,4.811023622047244

1514944,4,B00005JLF2,The storyline was good but got less interesting as more episodes took place.  President and wife's relationship was predictable.

I have watched 2 seasons now, and intend to see the rest.  Keifer Sutherland is brilliant as Jack Bauer.  The entire season is 24 hours and each episode is in real time, an hour at a time.  It is full of excitement, suspense, and each show draws you in more and more.  I absolutely love it.  Watch it, you will not regret a second, minute, or 24 hours!",1391990400,,482,4.0638297872340425

I became a Jack Bauer fan immediately!  With my Kindle, I am now able to go back to the beginning of the series and watch each episode that I missed.

One minute five minutes from hospital, next cut to location miles away on lonely road. Locations make no sense, and since the whole premise is a tight timeline, how can characters possibly be placed too far away for anyone to drive within the time frame of the story. Too many unbelievable coincidences and attempts to create tension. He loves everyone! But doesn't know how to show it because he is too busy following poor scripts.",1391558400,,556,4.742268041237113

This show absolutely amazes me each and every time I watch it.  I have not seen any show
so exciting to watch in years.  What a story line, you really have no idea what is going
to happen next. I had not heard of this show, but on the radio a guy said he spent the
whole day watching this exciting show.  I was curious, so I did a search on Amazon Prime

I am not impressed that the character is a highly trained, intelligent agent who is ready to defend the U.S. against the bad guys but spends more time on his own agenda and seems to use his training and job to get his family out of trouble.  And how dumb(not street smart) is his daughter?  Granted, I've only watched the first and part of the second season but how many times does she get in trouble and have to be rescued by Dad and the U.S. government?

I don't know how people watched it on TV at the time of the series and waited a whole week until the next show!  I'm having trouble waiting one day!  Would highly recommend but be warned - you must be able to give it 100% of your attention when watching - it moves very fast and has a lot of angles.,1391212800,,416,4.098765432098766

However, that couldn't have been further from reality. After watching season 1, we are HOOKED and thoroughly enjoying the timeless twists and turns, along with a very real, engaging cast.

1515285,3,B00005JLF2,"I feel this show is done very well.  It is weird to have it in real time.  It is difficult to not have more rapid resolution like most one hour shows to serials.  But, after adjusting my perceptions, I like the hour by hour presentation.  And, really, who doesn't like Kiefer Sullivan?  I don't like certain aspects of the content though.  This is not a show AT ALL for young viewers and I wouldn't even like my teenagers watching it.  I am not sure I will continue to watch in subsequent seasons for the same reason.  There is a lost of familial lying.  There are multiple rapes.  There is little regard for human life, except, I do like the fact that Jack Bower tries to do all he can to save lives rather than take them at will.",1390348800,,731,4.231884057971015

What a great show for my husband and for me.  We were never able to watch these series, of which we weren't aware in a lot of cases, due to our schedules.  Now we can view these without any pre-recording and whenever we can squeeze an episode into our schedule.

1515416,4,B00005JLF2,Enjoyable.  Every episode was chocked full of twists and turns and kept me guessing as to who could be trusted and who couldn't.  Keifer was good but not great.  He was always using the same lines and it got a little old.  Writers could have been a little more creative in some of the lines and some of the delivery.  All-in-all worth watching,1389830400,,343,4.380952380952381

Highly entertaining and is smart and thought provoking. I hesitated for a long time to watch this, now I'm glad I finally am. I'm grateful that Amazon has the entire show on Amazon Prime, no commercials (yippee!); I'm looking forward to the next one, I'm now at 7a-8a:) Thanks Amazon and the producers of 24.",1389830400,,485,4.4

1515520,4,B00005JLF2,I think the story line is very interesting and the acting is good but it is stretched into too many shows.  It does get boring within each show but keeps your interest because the story is so fascinating.,1389657600,,204,4.368421052631579

Now that I'm watching it on Amazon I'm doubly glad that I did because I think the hour by hour format of the show would have driven me crazy; i.e. waiting a week to see what happened in the next hour.  All that said, it is suspenseful but sometimes the story line seems a bit weak or even unbelievable.

Now that it's winter we were looking for something to watch while working out and this fits the spot nicely. We're up to episode 5 and find the layers of the story to be interesting and the pace good. Being commercial free helps too. Our only real jab so far is some of the stupid behaviors from some of the characters. In particular, Jack's wife never calls the cops when she should. Instead she races off to save the day and at this point has finally realized she was stupid. Need to watch the next episodes to see how it works out for her.

Watch it. But don't take it too seriously.",1388880000,,671,4.161538461538462

1515967,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" is a fast paced, action packed drama starring Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer who works for CTU, a Counter Terrorist Unit.  His job is to protect Senator David Palmer as he runs for President. His wife and daughter are kidnapped and Bauer is caught between his job and his family to stop a threat to the senator.  Each episode is one hour out of a day starting at 12am and it's hard to believe that so much can happen in one day.

1516077,5,B00005JLF2,I am not into overly violent movies but this series seems to keep just under my threshold of too much. Very little in the way of explicit sexual scenes or unnecessary profanity. Kept me on my seats edge for most of the time and not having commercial interruptions makes this that much better...,1388534400,,294,4.566037735849057
1516078,5,B00005JLF2,Season 1 is one of my favorite seasons because they don't have insane amounts of violence and it still manages to have a great and engaging plot.

1516181,5,B00005JLF2,I had never seen any episodes of this series and I had wanted to see it for quite awhile. So when I joined Amazon Prime I decided to give it a try.  It's nonstop exciting and draws you in. You never know what's going to happen next. Keifer Sutherland is excellent along with the rest of the cast.  I understand there is going to be a spin off or a continuation of the series beginning in June 2014 called 24:  Live Another Day. Keifer also stars.,1387497600,,446,4.162790697674419

1516183,1,B00005JLF2,"Now that season 3 of Homeland is done, I figured I'd check out 24 to further scratch my intelligence itch since I never watched it back in the day.  That was my first mistake.  My second mistake was to continue watching nearly all of season 1.  Nearing the end, the only thing worth looking forward to were the plot holes large enough to drive a bullet proof limo through.

As bad as the plot holes was the inexplicable and condescending moralizing.  When Jack tells hostage-taker Rick, as he's hiding in a water tower loading his gun, that ""the first way to get a second chance is to take responsibility,"" I almost lost it.  Later, when Kim is at Rick's house, against her will, she asks Rick why he doesn't want more from his life.  He says he's had a rough childhood.  She tells him that that's no excuse because ""she has a friend who spent years in foster homes and now has a scholarship to Stanford.""  Oh my God.  That time I did lose it.  I didn't know that the Bauer clan was not only involved in serious terrorist trouble, they also work part time for Dr. Phil and Hallmark.  By the way, Kim, you were the one who sneaked out of the house to do drugs with anonymous college boys.  Maybe you should have been studying for your SATs before telling someone else how to live their life?

I kept hoping Jack's family would be shot by what turns out to be the most inept terrorists known to Man so I could counsel him with my armchair Buddhism - ""Jack, you know that attachment is the root cause of suffering.  One must let go of attachments in order to be free from said suffering.  I had a friend once who spent time in foster homes and now he's at Stanford, free from attachment and as such, no longer suffers from the ignorance that once dictated his existence.""

On a hunch, I looked up the creator of the show, Joel Surnow because I was raised with this deluded morality.  Sure enough, Mr. Surnow is one of Hollywood's rare conservatives.  I am aware that the ""this is how the world SHOULD be and this is what people NEED to do"" morality is not unique to conservatives.  But I played that hunch and it panned out.

Had the show closed the plot holes, left the patronizing life messages out of the script, and employed decent actors, perhaps 24 would have stood a chance.  Can you imagine if Seinfeld pulled this crap - ""But, George, it's hard to fail but it's worse to have never tried to succeed.""  Absolutely, Jerry.  And, thanks 24 - you helped me realize the inherent peril of expectations.",1387497600,9,2502,4.389130434782609
1516184,5,B00005JLF2,I found this to be addictive.  It is packed with action and lots of twists.  Definitely worth watching. Thumbs up.,1387497600,,114,4.65

I will watch hour two soon to see how everything develops before I comment further.",1386720000,,451,4.345238095238095

I am almost finished with Season 1 and plan to continue to watch the others.

They're all good, although quite hyper, and by the 20th hour the viewer cannot believe that it's still the same day as the activity in the first hour.  Still, they're all fun to watch.  And Gregory Itzin, who plays President Charles Logan, is the best actor of the entire nine seasons.

This review is really for seasons one through six.

It is just absolutely amazing because everything is so new and you literally cannot peel yourself away from this show. Every aspect of this show is stellar from the acting, the action and the riveting plot lines. If you have not watched any of this show because you ""just don't think it would hold your attention"" then I dare you to watch the first half of this season and try to say that you are not interested...because you will be hooked...I can 99.9999% certainty guarantee that!",1384473600,,579,4.576923076923077

I love watching shows after they've been aired - that way I can marathon thru them and not lose track of the story line.
This was phenomenal, if you are a espionage, crime, conspiracy, government intrigue junkie like I am. EACH of the actors was amazing, starting with Kiefer. Nina Myers - the lady who played Nina Myers - is unbelievably great. Loved watching her.
The direction, editing, non-obtrusive music and best of all minimum CGI - they all contributed to making this such an intellectual treat as well as edge of the seat, nail biting drama!
Watching season 2 (marathon) now - can't wait to watch Season 3.

We are planning on making our way through all past episodes of ""24"".  Excellent show. If we had any complaints, it would be with the characters of his wife and daughter. His wife always seemed to run around with a scared mouse look, and his daughter seemed to have trouble following the simplest of directions.",1380931200,,441,4.313253012048193
1516715,5,B00005JLF2,"I had not watched 24 when it aired on TV originally.  So every time I was at a family gathering, I wad told I had to see it.  Fortunately Amazon Prime offered all seasons so that I could play catch-up by binge watching the series.  I now see what all the raves were about!  Best suspense drama ever!",1380844800,,299,4.103448275862069
1516785,3,B00005JLF2,"A decent season, but the series went downhill after season 4. I only recommend if you can get it cheap. If you haven't watched 24 on DVD you might notice more plot holes that are more obvious due to the fact you can watch the episodes back to back.",1380758400,,248,4.081632653061225

1516794,5,B00005JLF2,Everyone was saying how great this series is and I finally gave in to watch it. I am honestly impressed with it. I went in thinking It was just another cop-show. It isn't. There are enough twist in the plot that when you finally get something figured out something comes in to either change your mind or get you from the backside. This season is worth watching TWICE maybe even a third time.,1380412800,,391,4.36986301369863

I would catch an episode here and there from time to time and always liked it but never seemed to have the time to sit down and watch it. I actually decided to watch it when I started watching Person of Interest as I knew that 24 was somewhat similar. Now I love 24 and can't wait to watch it start up again in the Spring. Still have to watch 24:Redemption.

Love the character of Jack Bauer. Really cool good guy. Would love to see a hand to hand fight with John Reese and Jack Bauer, Lol.

Worth every penny and love every minute of this terrific show.",1379548800,,632,4.130081300813008

Jack Bauer is Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) super agent, but also father and husband.  It makes for a difficult life, and Jack Bauer is in for the longest 24 hours of his life.  If you've never watched this show I urge you to buy this now.  The unique and original format of the show was to have it play in real time.  Hour long episodes are an actual hour in the lives of the characters. You'll blow through 24 real time episodes before you know what hit you.

If I hadn't seen any of the other seasons I probably would have given this four stars, but since I know how much better the show gets, it was a little bit of a let down. Also, hearing, ""Jack, I'm your boss, so go do _____"" or things like that was a little awkward - it didn't fit with the person's character.",1376611200,,397,4.037974683544304

1517427,5,B00005JLF2,This is truly a very suspenseful series.  We were on the edge of our seats for all 24 episodes.  The build up of the main characters is well done.  After the first few shows we felt that we knew all of the main characters.,1375747200,,222,4.0
1517518,4,B00005JLF2,24 is an exciting show to watch.  The acting is good and the story is interesting.  Looking forward to season 2,1375488000,,111,4.238095238095238

1517524,5,B00005JLF2,"Even though this is over 10 years ago, 24 is an awesome series.  It hooked me in the first 5 minutes.  The characters have a complex set of relationships, so makes it more of a cognitive TV rating than just all the reality shows that are out there.  Plus Fox is coming out with another season this fall.",1375228800,,303,4.189655172413793

1517580,4,B00005JLF2,Plot line is a little thin but Season 1 of 24 is good entertainment. Some of the acting tends toward melodrama but there is plenty of action albeit sometimes stretching credibility. 4 Stars.,1374883200,,190,4.787878787878788
1517581,5,B00005JLF2,"Very fast paced, with twist and turns in every episode. Characters have strong presence, sometime making you feel frustrated with the ""weaknesss"" of one character and other times anxious to see how it will turn around in next episode. Very good TV series, my only complain is it is hard to stop watching it once you start a new seson and many a nights I have ended up staying too late at night just to see a little bit more :)  if suspense, action, thriller & some drama is in your taste, this is your show. My new favorite right up there with Dexter and Breaking Bad.",1374883200,,568,4.308411214953271

1517583,2,B00005JLF2,"This series came out in 2001 and marked the revival of Kiefer Sutherland's career. I had never watched a single episode and decided now would be a good time to catch the 8 seasons here on Amazon since I have a Prime account. The writing is horrible, the plot ridiculous, and the actors simply brain-dead. The fictitious CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit) that Jack Bauer is in charge of is laughable. I will not give away spoilers but the plot got more pathetic as the first season progressed. I actually wished the family would be killed by the terrorists because it would mean I would not be subjected to their poor choices. If you've had the misfortune of seeing the recent B movie ""The Purge"" then imagine a family as short-sighted and self serving having their own series, you will get an idea of how this show is. I have made a conscious decision not to watch the other 7 seasons because I've wasted enough time with this inane content.",1374710400,2,936,4.5773809523809526

1517585,3,B00005JLF2,The acting is good but the writers throw too many plot twists at you and that gets tiresome. It feels like action flick plus soap opera. Many of the sub plots specifically about Jack's daughter don't hold up she is smarter that the plot allows. Her character wouldn't make a lot of the bad choices she makes. It is too bad because the cast is great.,1374710400,,349,4.303030303030303
1517586,5,B00005JLF2,Very well done. Each episode makes you want to go with the next.  Definitely recommend thus as a great suspenseful watch.,1374624000,,121,4.761904761904762

1517672,5,B00005JLF2,"Don't push play unless you have a few days. it's very addicting.  As the hours end,  it leaves you on a cliffhanger. You can't help start the next hour. Great series!",1374451200,,166,4.32258064516129

1517676,5,B00005JLF2,This series keeps you interested the entire season.  It is great at keeping the viewer engaged with a fast moving main plot and a smaller yet important to the main character sub plot.  It is an action thriller that you will not want to put down.,1374192000,,245,4.304347826086956

1517750,4,B00005JLF2,"Fast paced, good plot. Not exactly like the previous series I watched, Alias. But equally fast paced, and in fact more intense in picturization than Alias. Kiefer Sutherland delivers a powerful performance. His daughter's role is frankly a distraction from the plot. Overall, 4-star.",1373760000,,283,5.454545454545454
1517751,5,B00005JLF2,"If you could only choose to watch one TV series in your lifetime;  if you had only one series to use as teaching for your children, it should be this one.

This series covers our reality in a way I wouldn't have thought possible in commercial TV.  It is not politically-correct, it tries to show both sides of government intelligence, corruption, dedication, self-sacrifice, and it pulls no punches.

The issues are compressed, so that gives the show an air of unreality; for in real life these things do play out, but with a lot of boring work in between.  Real intelligence gathering is a painstaking task involving thousands of deadly boring scannings of data which for the most part leads nowhere.  Or, the important data bits are often missed, until it is too late.  That fact is covered in the show, but only at moments.  For in the show, they have an unreal amount of success in finding the target;  but you have to allow for that, since it is a TV show.

Else, the show rightly depicts the reality we face today with not merely the horrible Muslims, but with all other types of terrorism.  Islam is a terrorist ideology masquerading as a religion, for example: but most Muslims don't know the Koran and the hadith any more than Christians know the Bible, so most Muslims are as horrified by the terrorism, as non-Muslims.  That fact is covered too, and without apology.  The show is frank about the Russian and Chinese problems, as well as blunt about the myriads of groups who want to kill not only us, but any government, using its people as a means to gain leverage or crow about how its little group brings down a goliath.

You will better appreciate the role of police, FBI, CIA, and all law enforcement as well as politicians, without rosy glow or cries of conspiracy under every corner.

Most of all, we see the devastating effect of negotiating with blackmailers, with terrorists, and how easily our integrity to defend ourselves is derailed if only one family member or loved one, is held hostage.  We see how those few who sacrifice their lives to defend us, are likewise shafted by government and family members alike.

It's a story which needs to be EXPERIENCED, and apparently the writers know that, by styling the series as if real time:  each episode is exactly one hour, and that's the amount of time over which the story's action, takes place.  That's why it's so compressed.

Series is painful to watch.  But necessary.  Again, if you had only one series to watch to orient you to the reality of our lives today, only one series to pass onto your children, pick this one.",1373673600,,2597,4.612200435729847
1517752,5,B00005JLF2,"I can't imagine watching this week by week!  We did a marathon and have watched this whole season in 2 weeks.  It keeps you on the edge.  I usually do not like this much suspense, but the story is good too.",1373587200,,206,3.975609756097561

Most characters were not believable.  His teenage daughter has been kidnapped is held by murderers, and she volunteers to help bury one of the bodies!  Also, I can't believe Kiefer Sutherland won an Emmy for ""acting?""  I know the show was on a long time and apparently a lot of people liked it (or it had a good time slot), but it was just too stupid for me.
The good thing is that this was free with Amazon Prime, so I didn't waste any money watching it -- only time.",1373414400,,676,4.217054263565892

If you've never seen the show, I always recommend, just watch this season.  If you aren't hooked, then you probably won't like it, but more times than not the people I've recommended it to have asked for the 2nd season.  The show just does an amazing job of keeping you guessing and on edge waiting to find out what's going to happen next or who's really good/bad.

Long Live Jack Bauer!!",1372982400,,493,4.433333333333334
1517887,5,B00005JLF2,"This is easily one of the best shows ever made for television.  It's an iconic thriller that uniquely captured and defined the post-9/11 era, although it was conceived prior to that fateful event.  Starts off a bit slow in the first episode, but it picks up the pace quickly thereafter and soon leaves you amazed and gasping at its intensity.  It's movie-quality suspense in a long-series story format for the small screen.

Kiefer Sutherland is the heart-and-soul of the show.  He chews up every scene he's in, but he's also surrounded by as fine a group of actors as you could ever hope to work with.  The bad guys are fairly evil in most cases, but they are fleshed-out human beings played by solid actors.  Direction and editing are superb for the most part, and this is exemplified by the show's high intensity level throughout most of each season.

Escape into Jack Bauer's world for 24 hours; you won't be disappointed.",1372896000,,926,4.708074534161491

The writing for this show is phenomenal and Kiefer Sutherland will always be Jack Bauer.  He envelops into this role as if he was born to do it.

1518076,3,B00005JLF2,This series is hard to get into because they have three story lines going at once. The best thing is you can watch several shows at once with amazon.,1371686400,,149,4.172413793103448
1518077,4,B00005JLF2,Still great kickoff to riveting serial type series narrative that was forerunner to 'Homeland.' Kiefer Sutherland and ensemble cast are world class.,1371513600,,148,5.7727272727272725

1518083,4,B00005JLF2,"I love the series as it is lots of fun action.  Based on personal knowledge it is a total stretch of reality relative to the capabilities of any government unit ""CTU"" such as this but this is fantasy and should be taken as such.  With that said it is a lot of fun and Ole Jack Bauer only needs a big S on his chest and everything would be right with the world.  There is some fine writing being done though with this series with tons and tons of plot twists and many separate sub-plots taking place at the same time and of course when one is ready to go critical that is the end of that episode only to lure you onto the next.  Again, like CSI or NCIS one has to take everything with a big grain of salt and only wish things worked this way.. Heck if it were true we would have gotten Bin Laden in maybe oh lets say 7 hrs after the hunt started LOL!  But it is fun to watch!",1371081600,,874,3.9152542372881354

1518130,3,B00005JLF2,"It was kind of ridiculous what was supposed to have happened in one 24 hour day. When you only watch one per week, that proabably wasn't as obvious and I would have enjoyed it more.  Overall it was pretty good. The acting was good and the story was interesting, but I was so burned out from season 1 that I haven't watched season 2 yet.",1370736000,,336,4.1692307692307695

I was so pleased to see that it was available (all 8 seasons) for FREE with my prime membership.  I am now on Season 2 about 3/4 of the way through it and it is still compelling viewing.

1518192,4,B00005JLF2,I caught 24 off and on when it first came out.  Really fun to watch it as a close knit group without any commercials.  Really makes the theme of the show (everything happens in a 24 hour span/real time) pop when you can watch it without having to wait a week in between episodes.  Great series.  Jack Bauer one of the all-time great characters.,1370217600,,344,4.328125
1518193,5,B00005JLF2,My husband and I can't figure out how we missed 24 the first time...because we became addicted after just a couple episodes.  It is action-packed but not excessively violent.  You are left guessing the entire season.,1370044800,,216,4.972222222222222

1518268,4,B00005JLF2,Been years since I last watched this show. A sense of nostalgia mixed with appreciation for how they edited the show immediately hit me. The density of content and multiple story lines covered in every episode was pretty ground-breaking for it's time and kept me hooked. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced ride.,1369872000,,337,4.9298245614035086
1518269,5,B00005JLF2,"This is the most personal of the seasons. The rest all have national and international circumstances involved. This one centers primarily around Jack and his family.

1518272,5,B00005JLF2,"My only complaint is that 24 is addictive and difficult to stop watching.  That's my problem, however.
It was a bit offsetting that in 24 hours, no one ate, looked tired, or acted just the slightest bit weary or off their game.  Amazing for one guy to have so many catastrophic dramas, kill so many people and be hunted so much by so many different people.  All in a days work.  My life is so boring!  But the storyline and acting kept me watching over three days, 24 episodes.  Totally a record by far for me who doesn't watch much but CNN and oldies now and then",1369872000,,564,4.224299065420561
1518313,3,B00005JLF2,"I first saw 24 on network years ago, beginning with Season 3, and was instantly hooked by the frantic pace and intensity.  Season 1 moves much more slowly.  Although the Jack/CTU scenes are good and forecast what's to come in later seasons, there is way too much of his wife/daughter's issues, esp. where unconnected to the main plot, and the same is so for Senator Palmer's family.  Those scenes could have been condensed considerably (or omitted in some cases).  So, Season 1 is good not great, so far (I've watched up to 6 p.m. = 3/4ths of it). I hope the last part will accelerate.",1369785600,,585,4.542857142857143

Kirk.  I stuck with it for all 24 episodes, and it was worthwhile entertainment.

It still doesn't feel like it was on as many seasons as it actually was.  This was my first time watching the original season since it first aired.  While I knew many of the twists, it was still gripping; I watched all 24 episodes in just 8 days.

1518887,3,B00005JLF2,"One of the most intriguing programs to come out in a long time, 24 follows a single day in hour-long episodes to represent ""actual time.""

The primary character is Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) of the Counter Terrorist Unit in California. Attempting to put back together his broken family, Bauer is called to the CTU when their department goes on high alert. There are rumors of an assassination attempt to be made against presidential candidate David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), who if he wins the primary could become the first black president of the United States. Despite the fact his daughter has inconveniently snuck out to hang around with some ""boys,"" Bauer heads to the office, leaving his wife to track down wayward Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) and bring her home safely. But there's been a glitch in the department. Higher powers believe someone in CTU has been feeding information to the outside.

The primary suspect is Bauer's former flame Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) with whom he had an affair while briefly separated from his wife (Leslie Hope). They must work together to track down this would-be assassin, who is mysteriously linked to the recent explosion of a jetliner. Palmer's security is on high alert but the future president is dealing with a reporter whose news story threatens his good name. It involves the actions of his son in an incident four years before, covered up until she received an anonymous tip. In the meantime we observe the actions of the terrorist team as they make plans for assassination... and accompany Kim on her party night as it turns deadly. Having agreed to meet her girl friend's new fling for a double date with a stranger, Kim is horrified when the boys refuse to let them leave. Packing both of them into the back of the van and giving her friend something to make her high, they drive to south Hollywood without revealing their intentions.

Reaching their stop, the boys force Kim to call her mother and say everything's okay and she's just at a party. When she refuses they threaten to inflict violence on her best friend. Teri, her mother, acknowledges the hysteria in her voice. Together with the other girl's father she goes out in search of their daughters, frustrated at Jack's absence in assisting her. But Bauer has bigger problems... two of their top agents have just been assassinated and the information implies a leak in his department. With a lot of luck, some keen intelligence and a touch of blackmail, Bauer must plug the leak, save his wife and daughter when both become terrorist pawns, and keep Palmer safe until after the primary. He must also capture the terrorists... before it's too late.

The first episode of 24 had me worried. There was a lot of violence, some strong language, implications of former adultery, implied nudity, and several sex scenes, as well as a hint at a lesbian relationship. But after that, suspense and action took the main floor and left more problematic areas in the dust. The show is extremely tense and well written, leaving off in a series of cliffhangers. There are many characters but we have no difficulty keeping all of them straight. Each individual is likable and yet possibly dangerous; we witness deceptions and double-deceptions, red herrings, agents who could be working for either side, and family cover-ups. While her father deals with tracking down psychotic gunmen, Kim has a profound lesson in how dangerous it can be to land on the streets. She trusts a blind date and winds up in a terrible situation, resulting in the loss of her best friend.

The integrity of David Palmer in particular is interesting when contrasted with his family's attempts to cover up his son's indiscretions. You can't help hoping he manages to avoid bad publicity and win his primary. Throughout the adventures Palmer makes genuine attempts to piece together his broken family. Even when tempted by an intern he remains strong and demands all of his employees hold to a strict moral guide. There are some foreseeable events; but the program keeps you constantly guessing and is difficult to tear yourself away from. I thought my workday was bad; contrast it with these poor people's adventures, and anything else would seem a walk in the park.

Like all modern television shows, 24 does suffer from occasionally-graphic violence, mostly mild language, and a few sexual implications. The first episode is the worst. We witness a sexual tryst between a photographer and female terrorist in the jet bathroom, as well as Kim's best friend from a distance in bed with her boyfriend. The terrorist kills everyone on the plane via an explosion after parachuting out. Presumably when the contact comes to pick her up she's topless. The shadows keep it from being overly explicit, but it was unnecessary. Later she flirts with the assassin in the bathroom where once again she's topless. Her hair covers her breasts but we do see part of her naked side and back. This same woman, who appears to be bisexual, passionately kisses her lesbian partner. In the 13/14th episodes, we observe a sexual escapade between one of the assassins and a clueless intern. Once again nudity is evident but cleverly obscured. Immodest attire is peppered throughout the series, showing a lot of low-riding jeans, low-cut tops, and short, tight skirts.

The two boys responsible for kidnapping the girls both smoke weed. They give Kim's best friend crack to ease the pain of her arm, broken when Kim refused to call her mom. The ringleader also refuses to pick up her body after she's hit by a car and instead leaves her on the street. References are made to rape in both non-graphic and graphic terms. Palmer's daughter was raped on a date when she was sixteen. Conversation about the incident never gets graphic but is repeat in many later episodes. In order to save her daughter from being raped, Teri offers herself instead. Discussion about her own abuse comes up later. Sexual dialogue is also present.

Language is generally mild but also involves one abuse of Christ's name and repeat instances of the term ""screwed"" both in general and sexual terms. Violence is less brutal than the show's top-competitor, Alias. People are shot at close range with mildly bloody results. A girl is hit by a car, flipped up over the hood, and left to die on the pavement. Her arm is broken by a baseball bat. Agents are mowed down in a parking garage; often we believe someone has been killed. Kim is slapped and flung around by her captors. A few people are knifed or assaulted with other weapons. A man kills a woman in the hospital by cutting off the air in her oxygen tube and squeezing the plastic mask down over her mouth until she suffocates. A presumably naked dead body is found inside a bloody bag in a trunk. Bauer scans the imprint of a severed finger into the computer. We observe the bloody results of a pair of slit wrists. A man is strangled to death with a piece of wire in a bar restroom. Many people are shot and killed in the final episode.

24 is an exciting series but has many flaws. Either watch all, or none... since you'll get hooked and be unable to tear yourself away from the plight of the main characters.",1363824000,,7191,4.788074133763094

I have a picture, but will not post.

In the back flap where there is usually a place for some sort of paper or information about the CD, the space in the flap was void of anything.  Perhaps nothing was ever in it, though.  Whatever it was, I don't miss it, not knowing what it was.",1362960000,,581,4.017391304347826

Watching Season 1 leaves you hanging and wanting more.  You can't go wrong but just watch it, you will find yourself staying up later just to catch that next installment (hour) for you have to see the outcome of what you just watched!",1360454400,,394,4.297297297297297

1519536,5,B00005JLF2,"Season One of 24, with Kiefer Sutherland, is one of the best series' I have ever seen.  The writing, action, tension, and acting are incredible. You never know from one moment to the next who can be trusted, who will be dead or worse; and at every turn, you have only Jack Bauer to depend upon to save this wonderful country and our way of life.
  This series pulls you in with it's hour-by-hour momentum of chair clinging, nail biting, hair tearing (all in a good way) action-packed episodes. I recommend this series to anyone who loves a great espionage thriller and ""How's he gonna survive this?"" show. This is not your average 'keep the actors in the series', many don't make it to the end of the day. If you're not a Jack Bauer fan after watching Season One there is something very wrong.

1519543,5,B00005JLF2,"Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Bauer, a counter-terrorist government agent.  In one, very long day, he will see his family kidnapped, be involved in the assassination of a presidential candidate, and uncover a spy among his colleagues.

This series will take your breath away.  Jack faces certain death every 15 minutes in a series of jaw-dropping scenarios that are both exhausting and exhilarating to watch.  Production values are high, with frequent split screens following several subplots, music that enhances the terrifying story, and acting from a top-notch cast.

Sutherland is absolutely convincing as the fearless and endlessly-resourceful agent.  He fills the screen with his charismatic presence and gives a riveting performance.  Dennis Haysbert is perfect as the noble presidential candidate who must cope with public enemies and domestic disasters.  And Sarah Clarke is unforgettable as Jack's ex-flame.

With a stellar supporting cast and spine-chilling script, this is a must-see dramatic series.",1355788800,,1014,5.662251655629139

I find Season 1 a bit slower than the other seasons, but ""slower"" is truely relative to this show and not to be taken in the context of any other shows. Because 24 is a action packed, adrenaline pumped, roller coaster ride of suspense and thrills.

One funny thing I recently noticed was that on Season 1, Episode 24 at 15:27, you can see the head of someone who is wearing a helmet that is not suppose to be in that shot. I can only assume that he was probably an extra in a part of the script that got cut out of the final episode or he is some sort of visual effect/camera person that was not suppose to have been captured during the shooting.",1347926400,,782,3.9808917197452227

As well as some excellent character development and strong quality values depicted, such as importance of family and patriotism and doing what is right no matter what. It is extremely addicting though, as others have said. Every episode leaves you dying to find out what happens next. We use to finish a season at 12:40 am and call frantically around to all the Blockbusters with in 20 minutes to see if they were still open and happened to have the next season in so we could come get it before they closed.

1519692,3,B00005JLF2,"Alright, the bad first: At least four different and OBVIOUS incidents that we counted of crew members and/or equipment ON SCREEN, plot holes big enough to drive a semi through, amateur acting by some key characters, atrocious accents, factual inaccuracies, questionable believability, and a TERRIBLE ending to the season finale- the only redeeming value of which was knowing we won't be forced to suffer one particular character's bad acting again during season 2.

The good: It is gripping. Each episode ends in a cliffhanger that makes it almost impossible to resist going on to the next episode. As amateurish as some of the acting is, you still come to sympathize with the characters. As improbable as many of the plot elements are, you still feel the urgent need to see them through to the resolution. The character of Jack Bauer is very accessible to anyone who is a spouse or parent.

As for the unique ""real-time"" format: You would think that it would get tiresome. In every other drama/action series, each episode packs the events of several hours, or even days, into an hour-long episode. It introduces the plot, develops it, and concludes it all in the same episode, keeping it exciting from start to finish. You might wonder how a show that packs only an hour's worth of action into an hour-long program would manage to remain fast-paced and captivating, but it does. Admittedly, it does this by pushing the limits of realism. The season starts at midnight of what has obviously been a busy day for all involved. By the end of the ""day"" (midnight of the following day), each of the characters has gone at least 40 impossibly intense hours straight with no rest. In fact, in Jack's case, he has gotten no sleep and consumed a grand total of one meal over the course of what he calls, in an incredible understatement, ""the longest day of my life."" But each episode manages to be compelling enough to cause you to ignore the weaknesses. You simply must find out what happens next.

I am glad to have had the option to watch the episodes in chunks, rather than the one episode per week while they were being televised. I think I would have found the series even more disappointing if I had to wait week after week for the next disappointing installment. I would have to say that if I knew all eight seasons were going to have the same weaknesses as season one (""Day One""), I would not continue. However, Kiefer Sutherland won a Best Actor award for season two, and it seems to have garnered some critical acclaim. We'll probably give it a chance. It is safe to say that if we begin season 2, we will most likely watch it through to the conclusion. I guess that must say something about the show. Or maybe just my own personal neuroses... :)",1336262400,,2748,4.638603696098563

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

Kiefer Sutherland was totaly aweinspiring as Jack. The way he played on your emotions... all I can say is he is a virtuoso when it comes to playing your heart strings! At first it kind of irritated me that they kept replacing people that I had gotten used to but, after watching more of the show it made sense. That job is SO intense that it was only natural that people would ""burn out"" quickly in real life & this show was all about trying to give it that ""real life"" feel.

Kiefer Sutherland is yummy, no doubt (although the older he gets, the more he looks and sounds like his dad, whom I've also always liked). The character Jack Bauer is a hero, although a flawed man, but that only serves to make the viewer root for him, despite the fact that he is as ruthless as he has to be to get the job done.

This show is a high-adventure spy novel come to life. There are a few moments of ""Awww, c'mon ... really?!?"" But that's a BIG part of the fun. You have to suspend belief (the dishes will still be there, and your check book will wait to be balanced) and just go along for the wild ride.

Lots of twists and turns through the series; lots of *GASP* ""NO WAY!"" moments. I'm almost through Season 3 as of the date of this review, and I'm hooked.

Since the series lasted a long time, there are some parts that drag a bit - some themes/scenarios repeat - but it's generally action-packed, intense, attention-grabbing, entertaining, relevant, and thought-provoking (if you want to go there - but it can be fun to watch just for the action/suspense). The acting and writing is great - it's amazing they kept my attention for so long. I definitely empathize with most of the characters and had very strong feelings towards all of them. There are tons of reviews out there so it's easy to explore more - I think that the volume and variety of reactions and discussions are recommendation enough - this show had cultural impact.

1519762,4,B00005JLF2,"""24"" was exciting from the word 'Go',in the beginning itself some clever wench on a plane explodes a bomb she comes down by parachute and plane bursts into flames crashing in a desert. The first season was very well written to the last detail. The concept of whole season about 24 hours in a man's life ,his one day making all episode is in itself was unique. Sarah Clarke plays Nina Myers and is lovely throughout but the writers had something else in mind when the turned her into a turncoat double agent. She is poised and exquisite and her eyes are really beautiful. She plays a pivotal role throughout.

Penny Johnson on the other hand plays a exasperating and nasty Sherry Palmer wife of Presidential nominee David Palmer. She is quite a maniac about seeing her Husband in White House and for fulfilling that dream she becomes totally unscrupulous,not even heeding her husbands words,always going against him and plotting and hatching underhand schemes behind his back. She even asks his secretary to seduce him but he eventually fires her. She is the most detestable character on-screen and constantly irritates viewers by her mean and conniving and deceitful ways.

Daniel Bess as Rick Allen is quite good looking nice and innocent looking guy boy next door type. He is Kim Bauer's young friend,his pal gets killed by the gangster who asked them to bring Kim to him. He is quite unaware of his friend's plans. Plays an important part in rescuing Kim and Teri  along with Jack Bauer. He comes out as an amiable and lovely character.

1519763,4,B00005JLF2,"I recently rewatched this season. I had seen it when it first aired some years ago. ****spoiler alert***

Overall it is a great show, one of the best seasons. For the most part the acting is good, the plot is entertaining and the twists are enough to keep you on your toes.

Some of the problems with this show, especially in this season but it continues into later seasons is the coincidental nature of a lot of the twists and the unrealistic aspects especially the stupidity of this supposed sophisticated agency called CTU.

I cannot really explain in sophisticated language what I mean so I'll dumb it down. Some of the things in this show are just plain stupid.

For example, isn't it interesting how in places that are represented as being highly secure ie. CTU, the place where David Palmer is giving his speech, in later seasons the Whitehouse, that even with all that security including surveillance cameras and security agents, there is always one room that is completely without security? What an interesting coincidence that is.

How about how all of the CTU agents are easily eliminated by a single enemy whenever they are supposed to guard somebody? The agents are supposedly well trained yet they make such careless decisions. For example, when the two guys were attacking the agents in the safe house, the last remaining agent had time to get Kim and Terri upstairs to a room and check doors for enemies but he did not have the common sense to call for back up? Makes absolutely no sense.

Or how when investigating something, like when George Mason sent somebody to check on the Bauer house how it was a single agent. Does that make any sense, given how it was known that not only were Terri and Kim kidnapped, but their safe house was also attacked so wouldn't it be probable that the Bauer home would also be in danger? Why send only one agent? Again the coincidence that Terri just happened to be coming to the house at that exact moment the single agent was killed.

Or how about how whenever a key suspect is in a position to be arrested and interrogated something happens to them, eg. renegade sniper who is supposed to be on your side, crazy b1tch who stabs the person (this happened in s1&s6).

What about how the ""highly secretive"" and ""highly secure"" secret prison operated by the Department of Defense only had 3 guards, 1 warden and then some maintenance men when they were expecting a highly dangerous prison or how the enemies were able to force entry into this facility so easily? What about how shoddy the wiring work was?

I don't really want to bring race into this, but how come so many black characters are killed? The black agents in this are portrayed so poorly.

Don't even get me started on how stupid Terri Bauer is, or how stupid Jack was for confiding so closely to Nina.

There is one amazing twist though, you never see it coming!",1327622400,,2876,4.59765625
1519764,2,B00005JLF2,"Okay, I admit I watched the whole 24 episodes, but I won't try season two.  By the 20th episode it was so full of plot holes I almost stopped but I had to finish the story.  Action scenes and music were good, but that's about it.  Spoilers---  Why would they have to blow up a whole plane when they could have just killed the one person before they got on board?-  for gratuitious overblown drama, an example that describes this whole show.  For people with so many resources and so much training, they sure screw up a lot.  On the plus side, Dennis Haysbert and others give good performances, though it's sad what hackneyed writing Dennis Hopper had to bear.

1519766,4,B00005JLF2,"We watched this on Amazon Prime and the picture and sound were excellent. We were another family that had missed out on 24 when it was being broadcast and I may be happy about that; it's hard to imagine waiting an entire week to move to the next hour of action. The concept follows an anti-terrorism unit over the course of one 24 hour day and each episode represents one hour of that day.

The story is very interesting and well done although very intense; it just never lets down. I told my wife it reminded me of one of the old Saturday morning fun club cliff-hanger serials that would leave the viewer hanging in suspense as to what would happen in the next episode.

Our daughter recommended this one to us and told us she gotten hooked on it and started watching it one evening and didn't stop until 3 AM the next morning at which point she decided she really did need some sleep. Whereas we didn't watch that much at one sitting we did have a hard time waiting to watch it in installments.

By way of summary it's exciting, intense, and has good sound and picture; I recommend it for older children and adults.",1325894400,,1117,4.360576923076923
1519767,5,B00005JLF2,"Even in the heyday of the silent film serial, the format used by 24 was old. As for the 24 hour gimmick, well, it is not why people watch, and without knowing what is going on in television (and, never having seen this show on TV), I feel safe in predicting that few are going to follow up on it. Oh, but that suspense element, will Pauline be removed from being tied to the rails before the train comes, will Jack, Doc and Reggie, escape from the Temple of VADA KHAN (I Love a Mystery-Radio), will hundreds of heroes on horses,  in cars, in airplanes, on cliffs, in canyons, in tombs, in submarines, escape the dread monster with his Ray Gun. These were daily fare once we had movies and radio. Of course, there were many other uses for the serial format; but, it all comes down to, tune in tomorrow to see if Jack Armstrong will elude the evil,,,whatever.
Having run on like this, in the face of 700 other reviews as I write, let me add to the chorus. While I would never watch a show which did not give me the whole story in less than a three or four episodes, nor would I watch such a show as this with commercials; but watching it with nothing but story, that made a hit. Naturally, one must accustom oneself to the fact that at the moment one of three or four ongoing story lines (which may be intertwined) seems to be solved, another immediately pops up. That's the nature of the genre: take it or leave it. The cast is fine,  production values first rate, music should be given special praise, and action scenes as they should be. I enjoyed the whole first season....but, frankly, I let more than a little time go by between movie length segments. I can take just so much in any limited period. Similarly, I have no inclination to take up Season 2.....to whatever; maybe, if I am still around a few years from now, I will be able to go back to this breathless pace of action.
All-in-all the DVD is the way to go; that is, unless the direct download or streaming method works. I've never done that with a film",1325376000,,2016,4.302631578947368

1519840,5,B00005JLF2,"This is....BY FAR!!... The Best  tv show ever produced !!. there is so much to say i don't even know where to begin!....Jack Bauer....what a man!!!...

My introduction to 24 was a pretty good surprise and was also the ONLY thing i decided to do for the rest of the day after seing the 1st episode...yes!!!...it was that good!!!......lol!!!... I remember going at the video store on that day hoping to find something new i  haven't watched yet...The manager  knew what i was looking for of course... A HORROR MOVIE!!!...as usual...Being a huge fan of horror and fantasy to , he came to me right away and  said ""I'm sorry man,...nothing new this week..nothing you will like in terms of horror...unless you go and get yourself an old horror classic back there...OR....you could try this...."" and then he shows me the cover with kiefer sutherland's face and a big 24 written on it.

I remember seing the cover and thinking...no.....i don't know....looks very ordinary to me..... I told him i wasn't  a very ""Action Movie"" kinda  guy as they all seem to be  the same to me.....plus those TV series are sometimes even longer and boring.....But then he said :"" No...i know...i know what you like and i know you have very good taste...but  trust me...give it a try...you won't be disappointed  i promise"".  I knew he was very good with the clients and was always able to make good recommendations. He also made me discover some true horror classics and educate me on stuff i didn't even know, he was a real movies/tv shows fan of all kinds and he knew his stuff!!!..... i  had to give this  a try.........

And Im  glad i did!!!!!..i started with the 1st DVD which contains the 1st 4 episode.....oh man!!!...This show is even worst then any drugs i know, ONCE YOU START, YOU REALLY CANT STOP!!!!... After the first episode i was hooked right away!! I actually ran back to the store right after to get the others cause i knew exactly what i was going to do for the rest of the day !!!....lol....when i got there  the manager was looking at me with a huge smile and was like : so? Let me guess...you came back to get the other DVD's?  I said YES!!..IT WAS AWESOME!!! I WANT MORE!!!.

And thats how my 24 trip started.... i was lucky cause when i finished the 1st season, the 2nd one was already available!! I jumped on it right away!!!! The 1st season is about a threat to assassinate president Palmer. Jack, who works at CTU (counter terrorist unit) is being ask to handle the case personally and discretely  as they suspect there could be a mole inside the CTU agency.

I SWEAR!!!!,... by the end of this first episode, jack has to escape CTU as the place is being lockdown, his daughter disappears, a strange woman is blowing up a plane full of passengers  over the Mojave desert, president Palmer seems to have a lot more problems then we thought and you are standing on the edge of your couch drooling and dying to see what's next!!!!....you just know jack is in for a very long day....there is so much going on when you watch 24 then its almost impossible to not be entertain!!!

This one would be my strongest recommendation if you don't know or cant find anything good on TV, buy it!!, go rent it!!!, whatever you do just make sure you can get your hands on it and i promise you...you will be in for a hell of a ride!!!! Dont hesitate to go and get the other seasons as well...i have them all!!! Up to season 8 which is unfortunately the last one!!! I think a movie will be on its way soon but for now...do yourself a favour and go get this!!!!....Quick!!!! Your runnin out of time!!!!...lol

1519841,4,B00005JLF2,"Writing for a TV is a skill, and not one that many have.  Having to maintain pace, coherence and continuity within sharply limited six or seven-minute segments is a remarkably hard thing to do.  That the writers of 24 succeed, and have done so over several years, and more in a context that imposes even more limits  --the action in each episode takes place in real time of the hour, so that each TV tear ultimately is composed of twenty-four consecutive episodes, all making up one full day-- is even more noteworthy.

And they DO maintain the dramatic interest at a fairly high level.  That's a notable acvhievement. In some ways, Season One remains the best of the series, although later years introduce some compelling characters.

But as good as the writing is, it's still good only in the context of television, where the general level of dramatic (and comedic) writing is terrible. In part, that is because network writers are, as a group, limited in their knowledge of so many of the subjects they write about.  Worse, they all, or almost all, have a tendency to use the mindless cliches of TV land, when faced with the need to develop a situation.  A case in point: Law Enforcement personnel are trained NEVER to give up their weapons in a hostage confrontation, for obvious reasons  --drop your weapon and you have effectively become a hostage yourself-- but in 24 that happens all the time.  CTU is, on the face of it, the most incompetent organization ever: Over the course of several seasons, it has twice been attacked, each time with horrific casualties; there have been at least half-a-dozen moles acting within the unit, and on two occasions, lose a much-needed witness to a shooting, once by the widow of a slain CTU agent, who finds her husband's gun in his desk while cleaning it out, and once by a teenage girl, a victim of a sexual predator, who kills him with a gun in his apartment after he is captured by CTU and while he is preparing to lead them to the other perpetrators.  Both scenes are preposterous: No organization would leave a weapon, and a loaded one at that, among an employee's effects, and no competent law enforcement would fail to immediately search for weapons upon securing a crime scene.  In addition, CTU is always losing a witness or suspect they're holding or transporting to ambush, to thr point where you can almost bet with certainty that if a bad guy is captured a few episodes before the last, he will escape, somehow.

But that's how the writers advance a story.  Does it take away from the overall effects of the drama?  It depends on who you are, I suppose.  Most people  --as evidenced by the show's popularity-- are undismayed by such things.  Even I can overlook them, or at least suspend my displeasure, and enjoy the narrative skill and the fairly good acting  --Kiefer Sutherland's performance, overall is excellent, and Mary Lynn Rajskub, who does not appear in Season One, is a treasure.

Contrasting 24 with another popular and long-running series from roughly the same period, Lost, 24 is much better written, far more cohesive and, for the most part, more believable.  I would advise that, if you buy or rent the series, that you draw it out and not view too many episodes at once.  Things get rather breathless if you do.

Dspite its flaws, 24, for a network TV drama, is a fine effort, and makes for an enjoyable evening.",1322179200,,3388,4.666666666666667

I did not miss TV during those years, but I heard a lot of commentary about ""24"", so I decided to check it out. What.a.ride! I watched the first season over a weekend, and it was amazingly fast paced, with multi-threaded plot lines.

When I signed up for Amazon Prime, I expected to save a bundle on shipping, and I do since I get several orders from Amazon each month. Savings on shipping pales in comparison to savings on streaming video: two seasons of ""24"" would be ""break even"" for a Prime membership!

It starts with dumb Jamey, the rat in the so-called CTA who kicks off the season as an easily bought traitor and then kills herself off because she can't handle the pressure of being caught.  Then we have Terry and Kim, Jack Bauer's incredibly stupid dynamic power duo of a wife and daughter.  I can't even begin to express how stupid these two are.  The mother Terry has remarkably poor judgement, always seems to be sick or acting strangely, is jealous and completely insecure, drives her daughter to a remote mountaintop when trying to escape a would-be killer, manages to send her only escape vehicle (with her kid in it) off a cliff and then...yes THEN gets amnesia after fainting.  Really?  Jack's partner at the faux intelligence agency Nina manages to put his wife and kid back into the hands of the ""terrorists"" because of the fact that she once slept with Jack (seriously), and the young Senator's aide who had the chance to help end the misery that is the first season ruins the entire plan after the bad guy tells her he ""loves her"" by going nuts and stabbing him.

Of course, everybody knows the movie(I mean show) is about Jack Bauer, a Counter Terrorist Unit Agent, who is having a horrible day. The day consists of him trying to prevent an assissination of the soon-to-be president Palmer, and also trying to find his kidnapped family. Somehow all this is connected. In addition, there seems to be someone in the agency against him.

This is the greatest tv show I have ever seen! Every episode was gripping and left me with suspense until the next episode. It is like reading a great mystery and each chapter provided more clues or twists to keep the reader in suspense until the end. Now I am watching season two and am taping each episode so I don't miss anything. I will end up getting that DVD set as well next year. It literally makes you want to watch to see what happens. Never has a show make me not want to miss a single episode. It is exactly as how they described it: INTENSE!!!!!

I loved that the writers realized that they could let  viewers know about family tensions, old affairs, rivalries and office protocol without spelling out every detail, but by just letting the characters react to one another.

Before long however, I had to ask myself, what federal agent keeps a tranquilizer gun in his or her office (like, between the breath mints and the spare post-its in the second drawer down?). Subsequent episodes contained more coincidences, and what were at first nuanced references that caused audiences to ask themselves questions like:"" If he's really in charge, why does she keep things from him?"" became blatant info bites where one character simply states that another character is a so-and-so. The man hunt at the end of the twenty-four hours had about as much suspense as a game of spy versus spy in my childhood backyard. The sub-plot concerning the presidential candidate and the person manipulating him became so obvious that I had to remind myself not to be disappointed - in this country we do regularly vote for truly stupid people.

I have wanted to watch a show that did not have the sci-fi twist for a change. My brother suggested I watch ""24"". After watching the first episode I was hooked and I knew I would love this show.

""24"" takes place obviously over a period of 24 hours. The show is centered on character Jack Bauer (Sutherland). He works for and is the director of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) in Los Angeles. He is husband to Teri Bauer and father to Kim Bauer.
The day is on the presidential primary. CTU gets wind of a very serious threat on Senator David Palmer's life. During all this, Kim is at a party and is kidnapped. Once Kim's mother Teri discovers Kim is missing, she goes out to find Kim and she too gets captured.
Jack being the director of CTU, he cant just leave and rescue his family, he has to work to rescue them while he is at work. Also, Jack believes there is a mole in CTU.

One of the biggest aspects of ""24"" that I like, are the many different situations. There is not just one event. There are multiple. In this way, ""24"" is similar to ""Lost"".

The acting by Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) and Dennis Haysbert (Senator David Palmer) was great! The interrogation scenes are very well acted by Sutherland.

Overall, season one of ""24"" is very good. About half way through it slows down for a little bit, but then ends with a boom! If you are a fan of TV dramas/action you will enjoy ""24""",1283126400,,1490,4.310714285714286

1520014,5,B00005JLF2,"Where do you start with reviewing the action-thriller series that has defined a decade? With the main man himself, Jack Bauer. Kiefer Sutherland, in the role he was born to play, shines as America's most deadly counter-terrorist agent. Due to the nature of the show, the main cast changes frequently due to character death and betrayal, but no matter who is by his side, Sutherland gives Emmy-award winning displays throughout the seven seasons and film.

How does 24 work? Each season is set in one 24 hour day. There are 24 episodes, each lasting one hour of ""real time"" in Jack Bauer's life. These aren't your average days however, they are filled to the brink with terrorism, explosions, conflict and anger. The ideas come from real world fears, including threats of assassinations, nuclear bombs, pathogen outbreaks, suicide bombers and more. Although some of the latter seasons do recycle old ideas with a fresh twist, the writer's have always come up with new ways to shock the audiences.

Watching this season on dvd is one of the best entertainment experiences you'll ever have. What makes 24 season one so great is the intensity and pacing of each episode. Each episode leaves you wanting more and more. Its almost like one long 24 hr episode that you can't turn away from. Its addicting, rewarding, surprising, fun, cool, suspenseful,and tragic. The show also takes more risks than other tv shows which pays off tremendously. Jack is an awesome main character. His violent bad boy side, combined with his good heart and love for his family make him one of the best tv protagonists ever. Later seasons tend to have crazy plot twists that borderline on the bizarre, but season one has one main plot that paces perfectly. What also makes this season awesome is how it is centered on family. While later seasons try to be bigger and badder by killing more people and making the scope more grand, in season one, its PERSONAL. And thats what makes it more powerful. You actually care about these characters while in later seasons you tend to laugh when the killings begin. If you have an inkling of interest in this show, CHECK it OUT.

1520101,5,B00005JLF2,"For several years, I've heard that ""24"" was a good show, but since I pretty much gave up on weekly television shows several years ago (due to a busy schedule, an inability to keep up with the programming times and the dearth of good material), I had never watched one episode.  At Thanksgiving dinner this year, my stepdaughter told me it was a great show that she thought I would enjoy.  I purchased Season 1 on her recommendation.  It's been five weekends since then, I've purchased a season each week, and I can't get enough.  It is simply the best television ever, completely absorbing with compelling characters.  My husband and I are both totally addicted.  I've purchased the seasons one at a time.  We usually start on Friday night, watch for chunks of hours at a time and are done by Sunday evening.

Jack Bauer (played by Keifer Sutherland) is an excellent, multi-dimensional character.  Patriotic, morally grounded, yet with human frailties.  I've only seen Sutherland in one film (Flatliners) and had no idea about his acting abilities, which are simply superb in ""24.""

I also love David Palmer's character (played by Dennis Haysbert).  He possesses the qualities I believe most of us would like to see in our President.  It is also prescient that Palmer plays the first Black president on television, several years before Barack Obama was elected.  I see several similarities (other than the type of woman who plays the first lady) -- it's almost like a premonition.

After watching Season 1, I was curious as to whether or not the intensity and strong storyline could be maintained over time.  I just finished Season 5 today and have already purchased Season 6.  I haven't been disappointed yet and each season is so good, that I really can't pick a favorite.  My only caution would be that I would never want to watch the show as a weekly activity.  I wouldn't be able to wait seven days for the next episode.  For Season 8 (which starts in January), I'll just wait until the DVD comes out toward mid to late-2010.",1261872000,3,2030,4.72934472934473

1520104,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is by far my favorite television show of all time.  This is probably my favorite season.  That could be because it was the first one I saw, or it could be because it is actually the best.  I don't know.

Let's start with the characters.  Jack Bauer is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time.  I just love his courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice (which we don't really see in this season).  In just about every season of the show, Jack gets messed over at the end.  But that never stops him.  In the next season, he's back and ready to serve his country again.  He goes into these situations knowing he could get hurt, but he cares about his country more than he cares about himself.  Let's get into some of the other characters.  I love David Palmer.  He is a senator running for President.  There is a terrorist group trying to kill him.  Why?  He's a black man running for president.  But is that really why they want him dead?  Another character I love is Tony Almeida.  I didn't care for him too much in this season, but as time goes on, he gets better.  Nine Myers was another character I initially liked.  She's fiercely loyal to Jack and does whatever he needs her to do with no questions asked, even if she knows she could get into trouble or lose her job.  There's an interesting twist to how her character turns out in this season.  I don't want to give anything away in case some of you guys haven't seen this yet, but man, that thing with her at the end of this season, wow.  Probably the most surprising twist of the entire series.  I actually liked Kim in this season.  I know I could get my account profile deleted for saying that, but I didn't really have a problem with her.  Many people hate her character, and I can see why, but for some reason she didn't really bother me.  The only character in this season who I disliked, and was supposed to like was Teri.  Some people liked her, but I couldn't stand her.  They try to make her the strong mother who will do anything to protect her child, but to me she just came across as a nave woman who stupidly gets into danger that anyone with half a brain could avoid.  I couldn't stand David Palmer's wife Sherry, and I wasn't supposed to like her.  She is an overbearing, power-hungry, manipulative woman who is obsessed with getting her husband into the white house at any cost.  I loved to hate her.

As far as the plot goes, it was probably the simplest of all the seasons in the series.  The bad guys want to kill Jack and Palmer.  Whereas the other seasons usually had the bad guys doing some complicated act of terrorism, this season just has this one plot line.  Jack has to protect himself, his family, and David Palmer by finding out who is after them and why.  The villains in this season were amazing.  Ira Gaines, the villain for the first half of the season, is one of my top three villains of the whole series.  His performance, incredible.  Victor Drazen, played by Dennis Hopper and serving as the villain for the second half of the season, was not quite as good.  It wasn't because of his acting or the way he was written.  It was simply because the guy could not do a Slavic accent.  That kind of ruined all the good lines he had, and made him seem less threatening.  But he was still okay, in my opinion.  His obsession with killing Jack made him kind of scary despite his horrible accent.

To recap, this is my favorite season of my all-time favorite show.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, and it was so intense that I just could not stop watching it.  I watched this entire season in two days.  It was that good.  As a side note, this season has probably the least amount of action out of the series.  It was more about the suspense than the action.  That's one of the reasons I love it.",1260921600,2,3793,4.291371994342291
1520105,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is known as ""adrenaline"" television.  This is because the show it utterly intentse, with contstant twists, and never really lets up.  Honestly, if you watch one episode, you'll be drooling to see the next one.  In fact, most people go through this show on dvd very quickly as its hard to stop.  That being said, watching the episodes back to back lends itself to a few problems.  No this isn't about the fact that no one ever sleeps, naps, eats, or uses the bathroom.  That would make for lame television and I don't really care about that.  No the problem is with the fact that SOOO many things happen in such a short span, or episodes forget what happened before.  [BEGIN SPOILERS] For instance, there is a girl who is kidnapped, drugged, broken arm, hit by a car and in surgery within only a few hours.  Now, while this is possible, seeing it back to back makes you start to role your eyes in boredom.  What was next, he mom calls and tells her she was adopted?  Or she finds out that she's actually dead, and this is purgatory?  Also, watching the show back to back really made the biggest shocker, the traitor at the end of the series, far less believable.  Somehow, a character, who was set up to be killed by the bad guys, found out who another traitor was, and investigated her, as well as was the only reason Jack Bauer succeeded most the time was actually a traitor?  This was very unbelievable, and was disapointing. [END SPOILERS]

That being said, the show is very entertaining.  I was hooked and enjoyed watching each episode, and was dying to see more.  Other than some mild problems with the plot, and some odd plot decisions that didn't make sense, I was very pleased.  Highly recomended!",1259798400,,1708,4.50814332247557

A complex web of events and secondary facts will catch you from the first hour until the last hour of this day.

Hair raising tension, an stellar cast (a true hit to have chosen to Dennis Hopper as Victor Darzen, the boss of this conspiracy) and an overwhelming edition process will make the rest.

Even if we ignore the consequentialist ethical values which are actively promoted by the series in question (i.e., the belief that torture is acceptable under certain circumstances; the belief that key civil liberties can and should be violated under certain circumstances; and so on and so forth), the greatest flaw of the show is that, in the end, it is little more than a hodgepodge/pastiche of who knows how many ""B movie"" plots, spread over a monotonous and insufferable string of twenty four episodes.

Sappy, because it uses every overworked plot device and cringe-inducing theatrical effect to club the viewer over the head. (E.g., Jack Bauer periodically takes twenty seconds to grimly canoodle with his equally grim, long-suffering wife as violins swell on the soundtrack). The dreck just marches through these episodes, with one-dimensional characters whose uniform demeanor is either wooden-faced confusion or wooden-faced stoic determination. This, even as the show's writers have them do mindlessly stupid things in order to to get themselves (over and over again) into impossible predicaments. The only redeeming thing about this series is its innovative chronological pacing, showing events in real time over a twenty-four hour day. Too bad the creators didn't bother trying to make it realistic.  If the U.S. actually has a counter-terrorism agency staffed with people this moronic, we're done for.

1520221,5,B00005JLF2,"I've heard a little about 24, knowing that it's Bill Gates favorite show.  I went to Brazil for a month and decided to preorder seasons 1-6.  I took season 1 with me and watched it from start to finish in 5 days.  That's 18 hours in 5 days (without the commercials).  It's incredible, suspenseful, and keeps you on the edge every hour.  The acting, directing, editing especially, is superb.

It's amazing to see each hour unfold over an hour.  I think this is the first show that is viewed in real time.  When someone says they will call back in 14 minutes and it's 11:07am, you know that there will be a phone call at 11:21am.  And it takes place in real time so as you are watching it, you'll need to wait 14 minutes to get the call.

Plot lines are very intriguing as well.  There are nuclear attacks, bio hazzard, threats against presidents and other high end government officials.  The use of military equipment (planes, helecopters, subs) add to the reality as well as the superb CGI effects.

Probably best of all, there is a 24Wiki site
( [...] )that is so indepth that you can't be lost.  The links, info, background stories, etc are very interesting.

I enjoyed watching this on DVD because:
1) No commercials
2) I can't stand waiting for a week until the next episode.
3) I usually forget alot of the stuff by the next week.
4) Tivo sometimes cuts off the last minute or two.

1520335,3,B00005JLF2,"Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer plays a great vigilante-esque government agent and Sarah Clarke as Nina Myers is a great complement to his character, as the two try to balance out right and wrong in their morally gray world. He plays to the anti-hero in all of us, doing what he wants by his own rules, but still having his own code to follow. Topping it off is Dennis Haysbert as Senator David Palmer, who is going through a moral transformation of his own in his quest to become President of the United States. These three characters especially grip you in the heart-wrenching decisions they have to make (often in a matter of minutes) and the consequences that come as a result.

These characters are supported by great performances by Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeda, Xander Berkeley as George Mason, and Penny Johnson Jerald as Sherry Palmer. Together, these six characters all explore the seemingly contradictory paths toward the same goal.

However, other supporting characters of 24 almost negate the stellar performances of the cast. Leslie Hope as Terri Bauer, Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer, and Vicellous Shannon as Keith Palmer are three recurring guest stars who can seemingly do nothing but whine and complain. Their terrible acting literally made me cringe during their scenes and almost turned me off to the show altogether. The eventual redemption of these characters in the story meant nothing to me as I could form no attachment to them because of the terrible acting. There are also a slew of minor characters who appear in only 1-2 episodes who serve the same purpose. Worst of all is Dennis Hopper, whose store-bought foreign accent is so terrible that he drops it in almost every other line.

Despite the pitfalls of some of these performances, 24 is a well-written Action/Drama with an amazingly unique narrative and cinematography. The performances of the stars are exceptional enough to make you look past the regrettable supporting cast. Each episode ends with a great and seemingly unforseen twist that really makes you want to see how the next ""hour"" of this entire ""day"" plays out until the end.",1235433600,,2122,4.921787709497207

1520342,5,B00005JLF2,"This is my review of 24: Season One Special Edition. Now, just to get this out of the way as a disclaimer here at the beginning. I'm a HUGE 24 fanatic. I think it's the greatest show on television right now. That being said, I might be overrating this in some peoples' eyes. But I'm giving you my honest opinion.

Okay, so there are three versions of 24: Season One on DVD. Since this was the third version to come out, I thought I'd spend the bulk of this review explaining the differences between this and the other versions.

This version has new and unique packaging, as well as a good amount of extras including commentary for the premiere and finale, as well as a 7th disk completely devoted to extras (in line with every other season of the show since). Many of these extras were created specifically for this version.

I will agree with the other reviewers about the packaging. On the outside, it's definitely unique. A metal box, with a little clock on the bottom that says 24, and a button on the inside that resets it to 0 and counts up to 24 hours. Love that. The housing for the DVDs, not so much. All the other 24 DVDs have cases that protect the disks, but here for some reason they decided to use a cardboard book with sleeves. First of all, this book is somewhat difficult to remove from the metal case which can be annoying. Also, it's not very good protection for the disks. None of my disks were scratched, but a lot of them were smudged from the cardboard. As a result, many of them skipped or froze in parts. Most of them worked fine after a cleaning though, and I was generally okay with it. It's not as big of an issue as some previous reviewers made it out to be, in my opinion.

As for the extras. They could be better, and there could be more of them, but I enjoyed them regardless. The commentary for the premiere, with Stephen Hopkins and Peter Levy was a snoozefest. Hopkins was boring, and the other guy was talking so softly I couldn't even hear him. They really only said stuff I already knew anyway. The finale's commentary is much better because it was Leslie Hope, who played Teri Bauer in the series. You could tell she was having a great time just watching the show and commenting about it, which was nice and definitely fun.

The extras on Disk 7 were good as well. Most of the deleted scenes weren't that great; there's a reason why they didn't make the final cut. But some of them were very good. In particular, I enjoyed Carl ""Chats"" with Barry. That was golden.

As the previous reviewer said, the alternate ending was not good. But, what I really enjoyed was watching it with Joel Surnow's commentary. He shed some light on the whole thing, explaining how they didn't like this ending, but explained the entire thinking process behind it. It definitely told me a lot about 24 behind the scenes, the way the writers think, and their entire creative process.

That was further explained in the included documentary ""The Genesis of 24"". This was very enjoyable in my opinion, but it could've been longer. Still, definitely worth watching.

Finally, ""The Rookie"", which is probably the best thing on these extras. I had never seen these before or even knew what they were. It turns out ""The Rookie"" is an online spin-off of 24 that's more comedic but still has some cool action. Not much in the way of suspense though. Still, these are a lot of fun. Definitely worth watching. Although, they're available for free online.

Now that I've covered everything that's different about this set, I'll take a quick minute to run through the meat and potatoes of this DVD set, the first season of 24. Season One was one of my favorite seasons, which says a lot because I love every season. The storylines are awesome, it's unbelievably suspenseful, the action is great, the characters are all very likable, the acting is wonderful, the writing is wonderful, this is in my opinion the best show on television. That doesn't mean it's flawless though. I've had at least one major problem with every season of 24 so far. For Season One, like most people, it was the Teri amnesia storyline. I think it made no sense and it was pretty boring. It dragged down that point of the season a little bit, that is until the awesome climax of it. Despite that, in my opinion this is the best series on television.

But, seeing it on DVD is even better. For some reason, it just seems like it's on a whole different level, watching on DVD. It's probably because there's no commercials to take you out of the excitement. But I can very easily watch 5 or 6 episodes in one sitting and have a great time just watching it unfold. No other show has given me that feeling, at least not on such a high level as 24.

Overall, I give this DVD 5 stars. Now, most reviewers knocked off a star for the packaging, but honestly I don't think it's a big enough problem to knock off a whole star. Maybe a half star, but it'd still round up to 5, so that's where I'm keeping it. Besides, the extras make up for the packaging headaches in my opinion, so this is about equal to the other versions of Season One. Life is full of trade-offs. Honestly, as for which version I'd reccommend, I'd just go with the cheapest one. I got this for $19.99 during the recent sale. Whichever version of Season One happens to be cheaper when you're buying, I'd say go with that version, because I wouldn't say one version is definitely superior to another. They're just, different, and they have different advantages and unfortunate disadvantages.

Overall, amazing DVD though. 5/5.",1233705600,6,5563,4.4970297029702975
1520343,5,B00005JLF2,"We love 24 in our house. We finally bought the seasons. It is intense and some parts are definitely not suitable for the younger viewer. But heck, who wouldn't love Jack Bauer?",1233360000,,176,4.53125
1520374,5,B00005JLF2,"For the better part of the last six years I have heard people talking about ""24"" at work but had never watched it myself.  Then two things happened, I got day 1 on DVD as a Christmas gift and I started watching day 7 on TV and was hooked almost immediately, which forced me to crack open my gift and dig in.

First off the concept of telling the story in real time is magnificent.  What an idea by the writers who created this series.  The concept does lead to some moments of down time to allow for travel and so on and that leads to some plot threads that may not be exciting as the others...but as a whole it was gripping television.

Kiefer Sutherland is brilliant as Jack Bauer.  A patriotic man who had plenty of faults and is willing to do almost anything to accomplish his mission even if it skirts breaking the law himself.  I found it compelling to think about, especially in this day and age...how far is too far?  and when does the end not justify the means?

The story was a rollercoaster!  By the time the Drazens entered the scene, I felt as if I had been pulled through enough drama for three regular TV shows.  People you think are important at the beginning suddenly are gone without explanation (the parachuting plane wrecker!) and nobody is quite what you expect them to be.

The Nina Myers character and plot thread was magnificent!  I almost fell off my chair when it was revealed that she was talking to Victor Drazen.

The escapades of Terri and Kim started to wear a little thin as the day went on but it never got to be too distracting.  Sherri Palmer is deliciouosly rotten.

Dennis Hopper was great as Drazen, when he shoots the daughter of his friend in the head to get Jack under control I was speechless.  The only problem I had was that the climax of the day seemed rushed.  Victor was sure that Jack would come to him for revenge and the best plan that he had was to run out the back door and try to get away on an exposed dock with Jack on his tail...hardly a criminal mastermind.

Then when you think it's over and you go to take a breath...Nina is not working for the Drazens but someone else entirely!

The DVD edition I got as a gift had an alternate ending in which Teri lives.  I for one like the original ending, not because I want to see a family ripped apart but rather because it seems a fitting climax gravity wise for the worst day in Jack's life.  The happily ever after ending seemed too contrived and Teri's death gives Nina some weight as a villian.

All in all a great thrill ride, I watched it all in three days.  I look forward to day 2!",1233273600,,2590,4.260245901639344
1520375,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" hit the scene as one of the most gripping, addictive new shows ever.  I never watched it on TV, but later purchased the DVD sets (all of them, by now) and therefore had the luxury of watching them on my own schedule, in order, with no commercials. Devotees and critics of the show will point out problems and discontinuities, etc.  I say: just go with it.  My sister got me hooked on 24, saying ""Jack Bauer is The Man!""",1232841600,,424,4.275

1520378,5,B00005JLF2,"I'm undergoing a self-inflicted 24 marathon. I have the first 4 seasons on DVD and if things go as planned I'll have Seasons 5 and 6 on my DVD shelf by the end of the month. I did not pick up ""24"" when it originally aired in 2001, although I had very much wanted to. In fact I didn't get to regularly watching it until Season 5 and after a few episodes was hooked. The shows' premise, that of watching a plot to assassinate a black Presidential candidate on the day of the California primary is most definitely ambitious, and somehow the producers of the show managed to make it work spectacularly.

To attempt an in-depth review of the whole of Season 1 of ""24"" would take up several pages of Amazon's review board, so I'll condense. Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland) is in charge of the LA branch of a government anti-terrorist outfit called CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit). His unit receives word from an outside source that an unnamed group has hired assassins to make an attempt on the life of Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert, whom anyone who hasn't watched ""24"" will immediately recognize as the guy on the Allstate Insurance commercials) who is a leading candidate in the Democratic Presidental Primary to be held that day. Jack, along with the help of coworkers who may or may not be working against him, must race against time to reveal the plot against Palmer's life, as well as find and protect his wife and daughter, whom the assassins are using as bargaining chips to make Bauer do much of their dirty work for them.

This is a very adrenaline packed program and the show is arranged so that each episode ends on the cusp of some cliffhanger type moment. That said, I think if the average person had a day anywhere near as convoluted as Jack or his family has they'd be ready for a lifetime supply of lithium and instant membership to their local mental health institute. The particulars of the plot change without warning and characters you thought were good turn out to be bad...and sometimes good again.

There are some particular things I learned from watching this season of ""24"", some of which hold true for following seasons.

-When Jack Bauer says ""I give you my word"" to anyone, that person is going to die a painful death, albeit probably not at Jack's hand
-Jack is very proficient at making suspects talk
-Kim Bauer, Jack's daughter, makes a great hostage. Easy on the eyes, probably smells nice, and manages to look good even when she hasn't showered in 24 hours. And she has a real knack for becoming a hostage multiple times just in a single season!
-If you're nice to Kim Bauer and can make her laugh, even a little bit, she'll date you.
-Ryan Chappelle, Director of CTU, is a perpetual dork.
-Short term amnesia is a serious life-threatening issue for any good TV character. It would sure come in handy for days when I want to call in sick to work but can't. ""Sorry boss, I have amnesia. I can't remember how to do my job""
-CTU field agents are like the red shirts from ""Star Trek"". There are an endless supply of them and they always die.
-No matter how far away a target is the CTU Tactical Team on their helicopter has an ETA of 15 minutes. And they will always appear *after* Jack has already neutralized all the hostiles.
-Dennis Hopper does a great impression of Christopher Walken doing an impression of Boris Badenov doing an impression of a Serbian accent.
-Dennis Hopper is amazingly buoyant.
-CTU has more moles than a fallow farm field
-Shooting a tranq dart in your bosses' leg is always a great idea when you're looking to get ahead on an investigation. I'll remember this next time I'm bucking for promotion at my job.
-Jack Bauer is like an updated Dirty Harry. Love him or hate him, he gets the job done and very efficiently.

All kidding aside this is a real action-packed, adrenaline pumping series to watch and you'll find yourself unable to stop watching the next episode, even when you know it'll cost you a couple of hours of good sleep you need for work the next day. I heartily recommend ""24"" Season 1 as a great start to a fantastic continuing series!",1232236800,,4106,4.558265582655826
1520379,3,B00005JLF2,"Okay, news flash: Jack Bauer is a bad agent.  A very bad agent.  I'm teasing, but seriously he leaves a body trail like you'd never believe. And heaven forbid he should interrogate you.  This guy is a walking advertisement for why torture does NOT work. Need a human shield?  Grab a civilian.  Need to get some information critical to saving people you love?  Kill the guy that can help you.

THE GOOD: The episodes are more action packed than a Harry Potter novel.  Then end so abruptly and unresolved (similar to LOST) that you just have to watch the next one.  Dennis Haysbert as the Senator who we believe is about to become elected is wonderful and it's strangely erie to be watching this two days before Obama's inauguration.  Almost prophetic.  I give Fox credit for allowing a show about a black president-to-be.  Keifer is better than I've ever seen him.  I don't think that's brilliant but pretty darn good.  The supporting cast are great although there are some characters you want to strangle they are so selfish/stupid/etc.  I won't spoil anything but you'll see what I mean. This is good in a trashy novel kind of way.  There are genuinely great twists along the way, a couple emotionally evocative moments but they are tempered somewhat by:

THE BAD: There are HUGE gaps in believability.  Characters make huge nonsensical mistakes after supposedly being so incredibly careful and smart to get where they are (whether they be the lead character or spies...I'm not giving anything away here).  Also, the show is ultimately depressing.  It makes you fear for your country that people so stupid, selfish and reckless are in charge of anything.  Dennis Haysbert as Senator is the ONLY shred of decency in the whole program aside from Jack Bauer's family.  The worst? The ultimate villain that is revealed (and the villains' family).  I have to give a badge of shame to Rick/Debi and Peggy who did the casting because the two they cast have the WORST accents I've ever heard.  Were you forced to hire them?  Did you owe someone a favor?  It made me laugh out loud.  I sat there with my wife and mimicked their accents.  It sounded like a bad Dracula impression and they are not supposed to be Travsylvanian terrorists if you get my drift.  The end result is a huge let down in believability.

SUMMARY:  You decide.  If you can get it cheaper elsewhere I might recommend that.  It's not a full price show for me personally. It is absolutely addicting and there is some great writing but the problems that I spoke of are inherent in the format.  You can't do a show about 24 hours and have each show only be an hour and then cram each episode with so much action that at the end of the 24 hours (the season) you really have a hard time believing what just happened.  It's on the edge of laughable.  Am I tempted to get season 2?  Dang it, yes!  You might consider not watching them back to back since when it originally aired I'm sure that if left you begging for more and the week in between episodes smoothed over the gaps in logic.",1232236800,3,3042,4.564814814814815
1520380,3,B00005JLF2,"Okay, news flash: Jack Bauer is a bad agent.  A very bad agent.  I'm teasing, but seriously he leaves a body trail like you'd never believe. And heaven forbid he should interrogate you.  This guy is a walking advertisement for why torture does NOT work. Need a human shield?  Grab a civilian.  Need to get some information critical to saving people you love?  Kill the guy that can help you.

THE GOOD: The episodes are more action packed than a Harry Potter novel.  Then end so abruptly and unresolved (similar to LOST) that you just have to watch the next one.  Dennis Haysbert as the Senator who we believe is about to become elected is wonderful and it's strangely erie to be watching this two days before Obama's inauguration.  Almost prophetic.  I give Fox credit for allowing a show about a black president-to-be.  Keifer is better than I've ever seen him.  I don't think that's brilliant but pretty darn good.  The supporting cast are great although there are some characters you want to strangle they are so selfish/stupid/etc.  I won't spoil anything but you'll see what I mean.

1520381,5,B00005JLF2,"The first season of 24 is unlike anything that has come before it.
The show revolves around a single day in the life of Jack Bauer with each episode covering one hour as his job in an anti-terrorism task force pulls him and his family into one gigantic mess of a Friday.
And yes, I made jokes too when I first heard about the premise that it was nothing more than a gimmick, that a story couldn't be sustained in such a format, that it would grow very old very fast.  And yes, there are holes and yes, an occasional plot line during the late afternoon hours passes over into the ridiculous, and yes, absolutely nobody could ever have a day like this. But so what?
On the whole this show managed to take the standard 24 episode television season and turn it into one giant continuously running storyline.  This is a concept that is so prevalent now that it seems commonplace and it's easy to forget that this is where it all started.  There were some shows before it that certainly came close, a number of the classic HBO series for example, but even those would break for one-off episodes before continuing on with three or four episode arcs.
I can remember the first time I watched Season One of 24 and how stunned I was when the sun rose in the world of these characters and how impressed I was that they were pulling off this concept so well.
But, again, just making each episode an hour doesn't a great show make.
In the end I found 24 to be enjoyable because it's enjoyable.  Great story, if not a bit over the top, interesting characters, even the annoying ones are fun because you get to talk about how annoying they are with the people you're watching with, and action that pulls you in.
The last time I came across such unabashedly in-your-face non-stop action with such a deliberately interwoven storyline was when I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Count-of-Monte-Cristo-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449264/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)</a>.
All Dumas was trying to do was tell a gripping yarn, and all 24 is trying to do is the same.

The taut pacing, staggering betrayals, and excellent acting had us captivated from episode one and kept us hooked throughout the whole season's worth of episodes.  We'd often intend to only watch one episode a night, but then 'force' ourselves to watch another.  There are a couple of ludicrous moments and some characters are forgotten about (the Palmer children, Carl), but I'm sure they'll reappear in future seasons that we've already ordered.

1520444,2,B00005JLF2,"When I first heard about idea of 24, i was pretty skeptical. An entire season happens in just a day, and each episode takes up an hour of that day. My first thought was, how can every hour of this guys day be interesting? So I decided I'd give it a try... THIS SHOW IS SO OVER RATED IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY!!!!!!!!! what happens to Jack in this season could have actually been wrapped up in about a span of 6 to 9 hours. Don't get me wrong the show starts off good and then it starts to get ridiculous. It feels like after a while they're just throwing in non-sense just so they can take up a full 24 hours. When the camera's not on Jack Bauer, or David Palmer the quality of the show drops WAY DOWN.

 This is because no body else on this show can act! besides him and the president. That's the real reason Jack Bauer is so extreme, because 96% of the other characters are BLAND or ANNOYING!! Not to mention this show has so many GAPING PLOT HOLES it's not even funny! After a while I found myself fast forwarding past every scene that didn't have either Jack, or David in it.

Jack should just buy a cape, and get his own show! I truly hope the rest of the seasons aren't this bad. So do yourself a favor and don't fall into the hype like I did. The only reason I'm even giving this 2 stars is because of Keifer Sutherland(who is easily the best actor on the show), and the fact that 24 was actually a pretty cool idea. It just wasn't executed properly.",1231545600,2,1451,4.120141342756184

For those who are unfamiliar with the setting of the program worry, it's not complicated at all. The show begins at 12:00AM and the last episode end at 12:00am and through the course of 24 hours you go through the events of 3 different stories; all of which take place in real time, at the exact same time. the first story is that of the head of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) Jack Bauer. Jack is in search of his missing teenage daughter, who might be kidnapped. The two other stories center on a presidential candidate David Palmer, who is having troubles with his family about an incident that occur 7 yrs ago. The third story is primarily the CTU center helping Bauer on his investigation. it is very difficult to explain the TV show in a couple of paragraphs with out ruining details; but one thing is for certain that this is probably the most original, effective and realistic show on TV. It left me glued to the TV set until the last episode.

so if you are a fan of shows like Prison Break, C.S.I, The Shield and Law And Order or any action movie than this is definitely gona make your day, your best 24 hours of your life sitting in front of T.V. so don't hesitate, BUY IT NOW!!.

1520450,2,B00005JLF2,"Sucked in by all the hype, plus the fact this is now (as I write this) into Season SEVEN, I thought I'd give this a whirl.

It starts at midnight. By 2am I was already irritated by Jack's wife and daughter, two insipid characters played by two of the worst female 'actresses' in TV history. Are they in some way related to the producers? I think we should be told.

By 4am I was starting to be annoyed as to how stupid the whole premise was. Trying to summarise the convoluted, complex and idiotic scheme dreamed up by the terrorists to simply kill the senator is irritating me even more. Suffice to say, the whole thing depends on Jack Bauer's teenage daughter sneaking out of her room at night to meet up with a couple of stoned teenage youths in a van, who have been paid to kidnap her. What would have happened if she'd just decided to stay at home instead? The whole plot would have failed, and we'd be 23 hours and 55 minutes short of a series!

By 7am I was shouting at the TV screen, to the goodies, the baddies, everybody. ""Why are you doing that, you idiot? Just do this!"" Characters behave in the most stupid and nonsensical manner, purely to set up a cliff-hanger ending for the next episode. Good grief - even the original Batman series was more plausible than this!

By 11am I was exhausted by all the ludicrous plot twists and character changes. Goodies become baddies, baddies become goodies, and bit part support characters change from simpering lovebirds to rabid nutters,and back again, all in the space of a few hours.

By 1pm I was fast-forwarding through the 'soapy' scenes, where embarrassingly bad actors spouted even worse banal dialogue to each other - the senator and his ridiculous son (who looks nothing like him and is about a third of his height), the senator and his wife, Jack's wife and Jack's daughter, Jack's wife and Jack ... ""I love you"" ""I love you too"" ""I was never there for you, but I'm here for you now..."" blah blah blah...

By 3pm even the action scenes were getting dull. Oh look, here's Jack again, driving off at high speed in yet another vehicle... Oh crikey, he's crashed! Oh no, the baddies have got him... again! The man gets through about 50 forms of transport, all in one day - and never once gets held up in traffic!

By 5pm I hate the goodie characters so much I'm rooting for the baddies. ""Go on... shoot them! For God's sake! Do us all a favour!"" Jack's wife is the worst of the lot, a strange scrawny individual who stumbles around weeping most of the time, showing all the emotional range of a Thunderbirds puppet - gawky, uncoordinated and with wide staring eyes too big for her head. This is fine when she's supposed to be suffering from memory loss and doesn't know who she is or where she is... but she's like this right from the word go! A more irritating character would be hard to find... although her teenage daughter - shoehorned into the mess purely to keep adolescent boys happy - comes very very close. She does a great line in stupid sullen petulance, and most of the time you're wishing somebody would give her a good slap.

By 7pm I'm realising I'm just a few hours from the end, so I skipped through the last five episodes in barely one hour... and didn't miss a trick!

It was a relief when it was over. In total it occupied about eight hours of my life. I wish it had only been eight seconds.",1228348800,6,3370,4.413848631239936
1520451,4,B00005JLF2,"This is an incredibly tense show, always on the edge, even if it gets a little cheesy at times you have to keep in mind they are doing a LOT in a LITTLE to give us as much as they can without killing everyone on the entire show at the same time, which might be a new interesting twist.

BUT I don't get it Amazon...You can buy each individual season for 19.99 or cheaper on the rest of your site, then you throw six seasons together so you can charge us 80 extra bucks????? At least throw in 24: Redemption for free, along with bonus discs, digital copies, something.

1520484,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" takes place during a 24-hour period (assuming your watch is powered by springs and maybe a rubber band or two). The 1st season had a few inconsistencies which I still can't get over, even till this day. But I won't give any spoilers. This is an outstanding series and every episode ends with so much suspense and intrigue that you can't stop watching. The story and concept are very well done. No other TV series has had this effect on us and watching it on DVD is the best way to experience 24. Set aside two weeks and 2-3 hours every night because you won't be able to stop watching until the end. ...

1. The Clock Is Always Ticking This builds suspense and rushes us past any inconsistencies, as in season 3, where the subways, streets, and schools are filled long after President Palmer has told everyone in L.A. to stay home.

2. There Are Enemies Everywhere They have homemade nukes, vials stuffed with lethal viruses, and Nuclear Power Plant Meltdown Devices (NPPMDs). Many of the enemies have prayer rugs rolled up in their closets and names like Behrooz.

3. We Fight Back With American Technology The center of this fight is the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), filled with computers and run by a boss who never stops saying stuff like ''Switch the A-4 booger-sucker node to kernel 7 now!'' and ''Nobody goes home until we get these guys!''

4. The Technology Always Screws Up Those tracking satellites are especially pesky, but the darn computers aren't much better; they always seem to be full of worms and viruses. I often wish that stoner guy would stroll in and say, ''Hey, CTU dudes, don't worry! You're all gettin' Dells!''

5. The Management Ain't That Great Either Last year's boss (Tony Almeida) went in the crapper for putting his wife's safety above the welfare of the country. This year's boss (Erin Driscoll) has a schizo daughter with a morbid fixation on the 7-year-old next door. Erin also loathes Jack Bauer and dumped Chloe O'Brien, who seems to be the only tech (other than Edgar) capable of using CTU's off-brand computers and no-name software.

6. The More Chloe Pouts, the Better I can't wait for Chloe (underplayed with deadly, delightful precision by Mary Lynn Rajskub) to return from exile. Why is that?

7. Never Trust the President's Wife If you watched the first three seasons and met Sherry Palmer, a smiling ogre who makes Erin Driscoll seem a schoolyard brat, no further explanation is needed.

8. Never Trust Smart African-American Women in General As last week's EW story points out, they all seem to be high-riding you-know-what cutters. Sherry Palmer, seasons 1-3; Julia Milliken, last season; the current Marianne Taylor; case closed.

9. The President's Advisers Are Monsters of Expediency Sherry Palmer is always the best example of this lesson, but recently the man closest to the current president advised that it would be better to scrag the hostage secretary of defense (and his daughter) in a purposely botched raid rather than allow terrorists to put him on trial. Harsh! Last year, President Palmer's brother wanted to snag Senator Keeler's debate playbook and later took part in an abortive black-bag job that led to a murder-suicide. And, speaking of suicide:

10. On 24, Suicide Is Always an Option Mysterious and vaguely Middle Eastern music preceding the act is optional (as just before Kalil Hasan offed himself by running into a truck), but the act itself is always on the table. It's true that Ryan Chappelle couldn't quite bring himself to ventilate the old brain bucket (Jack Bauer considerately finished him off), and Secretary of Defense Heller and his daughter Audrey were saved before they could finish sniffing the gas, but Julia Milliken turned the trick last season...and then there were all those hotel virus victims, lining up for so-long capsules. I kept wondering if they were swallowing them with Kool-Aid while the Reverend Jim Jones told stories about his dear old mother.

11. For 24 Hours, the Rule of Law Is Suspended There's no worrying about search warrants, Miranda warnings, any of that nonsense. Things are too dire. Everything is black-and-white; the good guys are all good and the bad guys are superbad (Nina Myers, for instance, may be the greatest TV villain ever). Certainly no one worries about a little torture with the fate of the country hanging by a thread. Jack Bauer never works over the wrong person, anyway. Although wouldn't it be great if, after shooting a guy in the leg and then asking him who he works for, the guy screamed: ''I work for Dell, dude! I came to fix the crappy computers in this place! Please don't shoot me in the other leg!''

12. In the Course of the Season, One Good Guy Will Get Killed Or -- as in the case of Chase Edmunds -- will only get his hand chopped off.

13. In the Course of the Season, One Good Guy Will Turn Out to Be a Bad Guy This is the Nina Myers Rule, and to 24 fans, it really needs no further explanation. You can't call it the Tony Almeida Rule, because I had a feeling Tony would be back even before he turned up to save Jack and Audrey's bacon.

And finally...of course...

14. For One Day a Year, Jack Bauer Will Not Need to Go to the Bathroom for 24 Hours But once those 24 hours are up, I bet he's in there for a long time.",1227139200,5,5277,4.677454153182309

And let me tell you by the time I watched the 5th free episode, I made it my mission to find out how I was going to watch the rest of the season. Veoh only had those five shows so I had to look everywhere to find the rest of the season. Lots of thrills and actions. Once one episode goes off, you have to watch the next one because its so full of suspense! How I missed this show since 2001 is beyond my belief.

It is ok if characters in a story make errors in judgment, that happens in real life. What I can't stand is error in logic by the script writers. There are so many stupidities in this script, I don't know where to begin. For one, the terrorists use two teenage buffoons in a van as a crucial part of the plot to kidnap Jack's daughter, and it hinges on her making the choice to crawl out her bedroom window to meet these boys. What if she changed her mind, the whole plot would have collapsed?!!?
Part of the plot is also to kidnap Jack's wife, which they do when she is out looking for her daughter, in a really round about way. Why did they not wait for Jack to leave, as they knew he would, then send in the heavies to take both daughter and wife in one step?  Why??? Because it is stupid TV, the reason I stopped watching broadcast TV 25 years ago!! I thought this would be intelligent like 'The Wire' or 'The Sopranos', but no ...

It's awesome, too, to be able to watch this with no commercials, & no waiting a week (or in this case--a whole season thanks to the writer's strike) to find out what happens next. It's great to be able to throw in a disc when nothing else is on, but beware....! You'll be watching more than one disc in a sitting! It's addictive!",1222646400,,749,4.047297297297297
1520515,1,B00005JLF2,"I realize this isn't a movie where you introduce characters, develop the plot, and wrap everything up in 2 hours, but after watching 8 episodes, I don't believe ""snails pace""
adequately describes the slow moving plot.

Did the writers really need a whole season to cover 24 hours?
One episode/show for each 24 hours would have made it more watchable.

I made it through 12 episodes. I can't take any more.

One problem with reviews for TV series is the vast majority of reviewers
purchase the DVDs after watching episodes aired on TV. Who would
spend money on DVDs if they didn't like the series when it aired on TV?

Most TV Series are rated 4 and 5 stars on Amazon.
Yes...Even the ""Flying Nun"" (Sally Field) and Beverly Hillbillies are rated 4 and 5 stars.

I bought ""The Shield"" and ""The Sopranos"" without seeing them aired on TV.
Both excellent series (with sub-plots). I would recommend watching some
""24"" episodes on TV before purchasing. Its not for everyone.",1221091200,14,966,4.6923076923076925

However, absence of Dolbi Digital or DTS is a big let down, espeacially for a ""special edition"" like this. This is the main reason why I could only offer 3 star.",1218326400,2,271,4.230769230769231
1520519,5,B00005JLF2,"The 24 collection is a worthy hobby and is certainly growing to be one of largest of the television series DVD anthologies. There are currently six seasons and season seven is planned for 2009. Each season has 6 discs, with 4 episodes per disc. Each episode covers approximately 1 hour of real-time drama although there are breaks for television advertising time meaning each episode lasts for about 45 min. To date there is approximately 6 days worth of 24 viewing. Each season is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next 24 days. It has won Emmy and Golden Globe awards. It has already achieved some of highest viewer rates for any television show.

The real-time nature makes it unique along with its split screen type editing where more than one scene can take place at a time. There is also the clock with its ominous digital ticking that seems more like a countdown even though it is moving forward in time.

The discs are held in a cardboard and plastic flip holder. It slides into the slim line box. It is not that easy to remove but this increases the security of the discs. The sound is in 5:1 Dolby Digital and the show is shot in 1.78 : 1.

24 season 1 is mostly about Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) head of CTU (counter-terrorist unit) who suddenly discovers he is made part of an undercover plot to assassinate Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). Soon his wife and daughter are caught up in the events. Each episode becomes an edge of your seat thriller with lots of plot twists and character turns.

Overall the show has very high production values although this was one of the early DVD TV releases and so the transfer quality is similar to the birth of DVD. Sometimes the widescreen bars produce fluffy edges. However, overall these minor glitches are forgivable because the story is so captivating although at times the suspension of disbelief is sometimes stretched to the maximum (how many times can someone get kidnapped in one day?). Still you would be hard pressed not to want to see it because overall it is a non-stop rush of action and suspense. Give it a go and see if you want to enjoy some more. The 24 fever is well worth it.",1217203200,,2211,4.547738693467337

The whole series is exsplosive with constant action and great drama. Jack Bauer IS my favorite charater on the show. The death of David Paulmer was indeed the only sad thing.
Can't wait for 24 season 7 to start airing on FOX 39 in January 2009. Now I am really into the show!! The DVD for SEASON 7 will possibly be coming out in December 2009?? I HOPE Many people say that the end of Season 6 Day 6 left a big gap not knowing what will happen next. WELL FOLKS! Fox 39 tv network has the solution. A 2 hour TV movie will be presented on NOVEMBER 23rd 2008 to recap what happend last in season 6 and what will happen in Season 7. The movie will be titled 24:The Exile.

1520571,3,B00005JLF2,"This Series is pure FANTASY.  In order to watch it, you have to actively suspend your disbelief.  If you can't, you will not be able to watch it.  Now, Keifer Sutherland is a superb actor. He plays Super Man Jack Bauer...an indestructible SuperHero with unlimited Super Powers: never gets hurt, travels at the speed of light, can hit any target with a pistol, is the most intelligent person ever created... etc. Only Jack Bauer, singlehandedly, can save the World! All the Villains are intensely Evil.  If you like watching Bad Guys..specifically, Terrorist Moslems getting killed you will love this Series.. and that is a big plus. The Villains also has Superhero Powers and intelligence..however I guarantee you will get sick of Nena Myers popping up again and again and pray that she gets killed... The actress who plays Agent Michelle Gessler is  the worse Actress that has ever appeared in  the history of TV.  She makes all these weird faces in an attempt to portay seriousness... it just makes her look mentally deranged.  The actor who plays Tony Almeda is almost as Bad. They both reappear in Season 4, at about the same time...I am sure you will be disgusted with these two.  After watching Four Seasons, I recommend you watch each Season as fast as you can.  Otherwise, any person with average intelligence will lose interest...if you have time to think about the Plot you wil realize that ""24"" is really just a TV Comic Book: Superhero against SuperVillain... it is Fantasy with a big dose of Violence...and that's what the viewing public seems to want.",1215820800,,1565,4.8277153558052435

1520575,5,B00005JLF2,"I first heard of this show from a family friend my parents knew, who would drop anything to watch the show on TV.  So my mom and I teamed up and watched season one (more like an introduction), and this became the kind of show where you're wanting to put an axe through your tv!

Season Two: One step higher in suspense involving getting rid of an atomic bomb, and Jack sacrificing his life for his country.  This really shows how Jack puts family and his country first before himself.

Season Three: Holy crap, this one killed me!  An airborne virus is released into Los Angeles, killing hundreds of people, while the romance of Michelle and Tony is a major entertaining part of the season.  This is one of the top seasons of the entire show!

Season Four: Sad to say, but this one didn't quite pull me as the other ones have.  Though the bad guy is clever, they never really catch him, and it seems that some of the same things are repeated.  But the season finale is amazingly done, and people have said, that the show could've ended here.  This is somewhat true, but we would've said goodbye to classic characters so soon.

Season Five: MY FAVORITE SEASON EVER!  This is a major comeback from the previous season, as Jack is forced to come out of hiding.  This season just never stops giving screams and thrills no other, and Sutherland really did deserve the golden globe that year.  This definitely is the season to watch if you're ever bored.

Season Six: Lots of people didn't like this one, but I really did enjoy it a lot!  Again, it shows the deeper level of Jack's humanity and his desire for a normal life.  I loved how some lovable characters came back, and it gets you ready for the upcoming seventh season.

The discs slip out of the rough ""cardboard"" holders and move about the inside of the container, scratching them.  I bought this set brand new, in the original packaging/wrapper and three of the discs had slipped out of their slots during transit.  The edges of the discs were scuffed up, as there is an uneven ""raised"" cardboard surface right underneath where the disc is housed.  The disc will rub up and down over that surface, damaging it.  There is nothing (like a hub) to keep the disc in place; they slide out of their slots and roll all over the place.",1212019200,52,660,4.5508474576271185
1520579,2,B00005JLF2,"I picked up the special Edition of 24: Season One, after seeing it at a local retail store - and I have to say this release really sucks.

First is the packaging.

The outer packaging is a gaudy metal case, with a LCD display built into the cover.

As mentioned in a previous review, the interior package is all cardboard. Think of it like a book with each page having a ""sleve"" for the disc. There is nothing to prevent the discs from getting scratched up as you are taking them out/putting them back in. Like the other reviewer stated, you'll need to get some empy CD/DVD cases in order to properly store the discs.

2nd problem,

Why re-release the entire season for a third time?(digi-pack, thin pack, and now special edition.) Would have much rather prefered to have them release just the first and last discs (these contain the commentaries) plus the supplemental disc, in thin pack cases, then bundle them together in a new outer box similar in size to the ones released for season 2 and up.

Then, those who wanted to upgrade could just toss out the old first and last discs and place the remaining discs, along with the new ones in the new box. The only reason I can think of as to why Fox chose NOT to go this route, was that people who didn't have a thin pack copy of season 1 would buy the special edition and upon realizing it's not the entire season, take it back to the store.

As for the new ""extra content"" on this set, I haven't sat down and watched any of it. My two star rating mainly applies to the useless packaging.

If you already have season 1, then I'd suggest that you skip this release. If you are a die hard fan, or a completist who wants everything released for the show, then I'd suggest you check Amazon Marketplace for used copies, because I have a feeling it's going to be flooded with them.

Fox should know better then to double dip. Yes, it sucks that there was no season of the show this year because of the WGA strike. And that's what this release is truly all about. There is no new DVD set this year, so Fox decided to fill the need by releasing Season 1 for the third time.
Shame on you Fox, and shame on the creators for going along with this stupid idea.",1211846400,34,2198,4.2898550724637685
1520580,4,B00005JLF2,"First, let me say, they had me at 24.

This is one of the best shows I have had the pleasure of viewing.  I was fortunate enough to watch this series live from the very beginning, and it grips me soo.

If you want a show that can cause a heart attack, this is that show.  It has me on the edge of my seat, and in all reality, has my heart racing! (no other show except prison break and dexter has ever done this to me).

You cant stop watching the show, but most people looking at this review could care less what I think about the show, and want to know what I think about the special edition, so lets get started!

The alternate ending.  is it new?  yes, is it good?  not even, quite possibly the worst thing I have ever watched (no, it is not badly acted, nor shot, in fact, it is technically sound, but the ending is not an ending, I do not wish to spoil anything, but to say it stunk would be a vast understatement!)

Basically the whole set is the same as the original I'm sure you have on your shelf.  Disc 7 is new, and has your extended scenes, and 2 extra documentary's.

The extra documentary's are nice, and worth watching, but not necessarily worth buying over your other version.

The case is beautiful, it has a clock on it that says 24, you can press a button and it resets to 0 and counts up, which is cool.

The housing of the dvds looks nice, with a fresh art design. The art is pretty much the same (on the dvds).

Last, but not least, the discs are housed in a cardboard container, 2 of my discs exhibit scratches, and 1 was out of the sleeve entirely.

I have bought other dvds in the past using cardboard containers, and the result is the same.  Not good for housing dvds.

Your best bet is to buy the dvds, get the scratched ones resurfaced, and store in other cases, or inside of a cd case.

Again, the show is the same, and one of the best things you can view.  if you do not own 24 season 1, this one is a no brainier.

If you have all seasons and have watched them many times (as I have) this still gives you nothing.

The show is a 5 out of 5.  This release is a 4.5 out of 5 (half a star gone due to inferior packing)

For people who own the previous version, give this a pass, and pick up the eventual blu-ray.

maybe a slight spoiler?  but I think not, read next paragraph at your own risk.

The alternate ending (the main reason I bought it) sucks, it just ends, nothing happens!  if you have seen season 1, you know what happens in the end, here, nothing happens.  and by nothing I mean nothing at all.",1211328000,77,2536,4.056451612903226

1520613,5,B00005JLF2,What a great show. Must have watched the whole set in 3 days. Awesome twists and turns throughout the season. The extras are pretty poor - a brief introduction with Keifer Sutherland and an alright alternate ending to the season finale episode.,1203897600,,244,4.833333333333333
1520614,5,B00005JLF2,"Let's face it, you've heard the phrase 'a new kind of television' enough times to make you go numb in the buttocks. Every two-bit wanna'be Seinfeld pilot gets styled that way, too often to cover up a lack of talent with the siren song of novelty.

But you'd be mistaken to be dubious about *24*. This show in its first season was about as *new* as television can get.

Packed into a format of take-on-day-an-hour-at-a-time, skillfully weaving parallel story lines into one coherent, bracing whole, Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer and his long-suffering, occasionally corrupt colleagues at CTU pretty much reached out and grabbed us by the throat.

Four seasons into the deal, one wonders how much more is left of a narrative with the structural limitations its writers have built into it. Yet Season One was not about 'how long' but about 'what if'.

And, to abuse a phrase, did it ever!

Who could have guessed that the ubiquitous 'Nina' would turn out to be not only the mole inside CTU but also a relentless disciplined Queen of Evil?

That revelation doesn't go down until the final episode of a stunning first season.

1520719,2,B00005JLF2,"The show does have a great concept.  The 24 hour timeline necessitates a fast pace unmatched by most other shows.  The writers were given a tough challenge in making this work.

Unfortunately, they didn't deliver.  Forget about plot holes that entire presidential campaigns could fall through without slowing down.  It's overall so contrived that events seem arbitrary, which takes the suspense away.  Ironically, the show is best at the dips, especially in the beginning when the events are set up.  At the climaxes -- and there are several -- the action is too artificial to hold much interest.

(For the record, some of my favorites movies and shows are Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Lord of the Rings, X-Men and Terminator, so it's not like I'm a stickler for realism).

The action-based sequences with Bauer and his family are supposed to be the most suspenseful, but it's the low-key drama where the show does the best.  Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke) holding down the fort back at headquarters, and David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) struggling with family issues and a conniving wife, are far more interesting threads.

I don't recommend it, at least not this season.  Two stars is generous, and given only because of the innovative concept and some of the rare portions that actually work.",1195430400,3,1286,4.957943925233645
1520720,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is a terrific TV series, no doubt about that. Sadly though, being a series also is its biggest problem, a series that needs to have its viewers glued to the screen for an entire season. Meaning, a lot needs to happen in these 24 hours.
A great storyline built on a terrific idea. Just too much of it. Too many turns to keep us waiting for what happens next. A few less twists and episodes and I'd have given it six stars.
You probably know all about it: A presidential candidate is targeted by terrorists. A special agent, Jack Bauer, tries to save both the senator and his own family which has been taken hostage by the same terrorists in order to force him to do their dirty work.
Great acting, good solid camerawork, good storyline (at least in the beginning). Somewhere in the middle things start to feel too constructed.
A few examples: The gangsters appear to have superhuman intelligence on their side, whereas CTU bathes in blunders. Of course you can also call it luck when the bad guys are able to recapture Kim, Jack's daughter, for the upteenth time when she is escorted from jail by the police. Funny enough, a few hours earlier, the same super gangsters were unable to find her after her car exploded a few miles down the road with a huge cloud of smoke attracting anybody's attention, except that of the talented terrorists.
Of course there has to be a traitor amongst the good guys. This time it's the agent's best friend, the one he trusts the most (oh no, not again...) She turns into a deadly terrorist in the end. But her previous actions somehow never seemed to seriously interfere with Jack's work. I had the feeling that the screenwriter just turned her into a baddy at the last minute, adding constructed clues into the last four episodes to deliver  the ""necessary"" tension. Sorry, but way over the top if you ask me.
Other obvious mistakes: Jack's wife, after having been rescued, is being left to walk around as she pleases in the building of the Counter Terrorist Unit(she is a civilian)... a few hours earlier she said that often she does't exactly know what her husband is doing for most of the time. PLEASE!
Jack, when hunting a suspect, often risks too much by unneccesarily breaking his own cover. This is most evident in the scene where he, together with a female police officer, chases a suspect in and around a warehouse in the dark. When he enters the unsecured building, he doesn't hide in the shadows but stays in the open. The officer is shot, Jack makes it through.
A few scenes later, the police office building. This obviously is the dumbest bunch of cops around, the way they let the ganster escape. But they have to be, the gangster needs to pull us into a next episode.
The list goes on and on. Now you're probably asking, why then five stars? Because of the idea, the acting and the basic construction behind the storyline. It's amazing. Even with all the flaws. You want to know what happens next - or what the screenwriters have come up with.
Best acting by Kiefer Sutherland as Jack, Dennis Haysbert as Senator Palmer and Sarah Clarke as Nina Myers.

More worrying is the fact that CTU can be so easily infiltrated by moles and that CTU's ""best agent"" is easily manipulated and goes along with terrorist plans, waiting for some miracle to save the day and justify his actions.  Too bad for all the innocent victims along the way.

1520893,2,B00005JLF2,"Never having seen an episode I bought these dvds to watch while recovering from surgery.  I barely made it through.

The handful of negative reviews here seem to hit the nail on the head.  Here are some problems with this show:

Beyond implausible and terribly inconsistent.  This is simply regular network tv fare with writing on the level of a prime time soap opera.  The bad guys are capable of everything but accomplishing the few things that would let them reach their many many goals.  The good guys are awful at everything except the implausible breaks that make them win in the end.  When it helps create fake tension, there is real time satellite surveillance available.  Otherwise it's completely absent.  The 24 hour real time thing does nothing as this is nothing more than weekly network fare.  It assumes a gullible, not too smart viewer.  It milks every stereotype.  Foreigners are bad guys.  Women are not trustworthy.  Government agencies always have to get approval from above to do anything right but can do the wrong thing immediately.  Cell coverage exists and goes away as convenient.  Amnesia happens all the time.  People park cars on the edge of cliffs.  Bad parts of town are mazes from which there is no escape and in which it is impossible to get help.  Teenagers are idiots and can't make a single good decision.  OK well maybe that last one is on target.....

The may plot twists exist only as constant contrivances to create fake tension and fill up the 24 hours.  All the cliches are here and season one is essentially one long 'false rescue' scene after another from a mailorder screen writer's school.  The 24 hour contrivance ruined the show for me more than anything.  Nothing could really be resolved - nor is it until the absolute end.  As a result the pacing suffers horribly.  Because there is soooo much time to fill, and because there are so many implausibilities and inconsistencies, the writers end up with one of the major failings of network shows - explaining everything even though so many things make no sense whatsoever.  Watching the DVDs was a grind to get to any kind of resolution whatsoever, when this could have been a 2 hour episode of an excellent series.  This seems to have worked well as weekly pulp fare, but falls down completely as good tv on DVD.

There are a few bright spots.

The performances are (excepting the entire Palmer plotline) quite good given what the actors are given to work with.  Sutherland is excellent considering.  The transfer and sound are both OK for the most part with the exception of a few obvious compression hitches during high motion scenes.  Also this set is pretty inexpensive now.

I had hoped that this highly touted network show would rise above network drama fare as Lost has.  Instead it was an average TV drama with a decent cast that was hamstrung by it's 24 hour realtime framework and usual network sensibilities.

I'll stick with the cable networks for most of my dramas.",1183075200,4,2977,4.7329434697855755

It doesn't lose focus of your attension for once. Keifer is very convincing in this shows and he's also a very good actor.

I loaned this season to a buddy of mine, and his girlfreind was actually mad at me. Because she could not stop watching and had alot to do that day. They were suppost to watch it together, but she beat him 24 to 4. The one thing I don't like is it makes action movies that are actually probably pretty good seem bad to me. One example, ""The Sentinal"". I did not like it. I have an addictive personality. If you do too, and pop that first disk in. I suggest you have all your things in order, bills paid in  advance.

I kind of wish they'd have used the alternate ending for the season finale - I'm an ""and they all lived happily ever-after"" person, but... oh well.  What a great show!  I've seen Kiefer Sutherland in other things and wasn't sure where his showbiz career would lead him in the years following; I'm thrilled to see him in this.

1520898,1,B00005JLF2,"I don't like this show. It's very unrealistic and full of plot holes. The acting is sub par in spots and I really don't care what happens to the characters. The ""Kim"" storylines are dumb and distracting. The concept of ""real-time"" TV isn't that innovative if you ask me. There are a lot of cliff hangers and ""suspense"", but like I said, I don't care due to the aforementioned problems in the writing/logic and acting. On the up side, this DVD set is good quality. If you're a fan of the show, you'll be pleased to know that these sets look good, sound good, and have great extra features. That is, if you care. I bought seasons 1-5 at Costco last Christmas because they were on sale. I mean, who would want to miss out on the most intense, action packed show of all time? My girlfriend and I watched through season 4, but became totally burnt out with it. I never want to see another episode again, so I sold them on ebay and bought The Shield (a much better show...and that's a fact). 24 became stale because of the rigid subject matter, and repetitive situations. The show is about counter-terrorism, so there's no comedy (not that there should be) and no change in tone. 24 attempts to keep the same breakneck pace the entire season, which isn't dramatic (only superficial). It doesn't interest me and I don't buy it. At first we liked it but it quickly became apparent that 24 is fast on pacing, and sloooow on brains/logic. A lot of people disagree with me....hell, you're probably one of them. That's OK, because I've got better shows to watch like The X-Files, Millennium, The Sopranos, The Wire, Carnivale, Deadwood, Rome, The Shield, Stargate SG-1, Farscape, Lost, House M.D., Brotherhood, etc., etc. Check those shows out if you want the best that TV on DVD has to offer. If the plot holes and ridiculous stories don't bother you, then I say go for it and buy this set.

If you want specific examples of the plot holes, you either haven't been watching or are as naive as the writers. There are too many to list (5 seasons worth). If you've been watching for any length of time at all you'll remember Air Force One being taken out in mid air, extravagant plans to assassinate a ""potential"" US presidential candidate (all they had to do was snipe him out), being able to travel to anywhere in LA in a matter of 5 minutes or less, etc. I mean, the concept of the same man having to save the entire planet 5+ times in a row is absurd, and that's what the show is based on. Come on! But they try to come off so real and authentic. I don't know....maybe I just don't get it; if you do...good for you. Either way it's just not for me. If you want edgy, ""intense"" TV, I recommend The Shield.

P.S. - I realize I'm in the minority here. Go ahead and hit ""not helpful"". I expect most of you will.",1180483200,32,2797,4.38728323699422

1520973,4,B00005JLF2,"This show had the bad luck of premiering two months after 9-11.  Because of the subject matter, it almost did not premiere at all!

As we all know, the show is about the CTU - counter terrorist unit.  Day 1 deals with the premise of an asassination of Presidential contender on the day of the California Primary.

Well that is the premise we are told.  What it actually is about is a revenge plot against two people involved in murder of a Bosnian politico and his family.

Now this show is real time. Each 41 minute episode, including credits, represents one hour of the day. 24 hours = 24 episodes.

This show is very innovative in its approach but very contrived in its execution.  The best example is Jack's wife and daughter.  They get kidnapped, they escape.  They get taken to a safe house, the safe house is attacked but they escape and get seperated.  The wife gets amnesia but somehow gets to restaurant were she is know but with a boyfriend, not Jack.  The boyfriend takes her home and then they get attacked by the terrorists at her home but are rescued by CTU.  The daughter flees to he kidnapper's home - don't ask - and then gets involved with a drug buy and is arrested.  When she is finally released, the police take her to CTU but she is abducted on the way by the terrorist.  And this is a subplot.

The weird thing is that this show is totally laughable but you cannot wait for the next episode to air.  You have to credit great directing, fantastic acting and taught and imaginative editing.

Now the following issues with the DVD set:

The episodes do not have chapter marks.  I was having problens with the picture and took the disc to wipe.  When I went back to the episode, I had to scan through the entire episode until I got back to where I stopped.

Also, there is a special feature on disc 6 that introduces the entire season.  So why is this not on disc 1 at the start????

This is a fun show - probably reminiscent to the old movie serials of the 30's and 40's but updated to the current century.  Enjoy this show and forgive the shows short comings.",1178323200,4,2081,4.3428571428571425

I would reccommend this season to anyone who has never seen 24 at all.  The reason why I gave this season three stars is because I saw some of season 5, which was intense, before season 1. I also saw a good amount of season 6 (also intense) before season 1. This threw me away because these seasons are nothing like the first.

1521059,4,B00005JLF2,"First off, 582 people have already reviewed this item, and I'm guessing a large %age of people buying any TV show on DVD have already seen the show, so I'm writing this review realizing it won't be very useful to most readers.

But, for those of you who haven't seen 24 - this set is definately worth purchasing (or borrowing - you probably already know someone who has it).  24 is a highly addictive show and season one is probably the best season of 24 (it's definatly the best of the seasons I've watched).

It does have its drawbacks - the overall storyline is not even remotely believable.  In fact, at many times the story gets downright ludicrous.  The acting is ok at best, and most of the characters aren't all that convicing.

But the show is addictive and highly entertaining.  I'd put it in the same category as Lost - watch the first 4-5 episodes, and you'll be hooked.  It's extremely suspenseful, often having 3-4 different plotlines going on simultaneously, and Jack Bauer's character (while not exactly believable) embodies the characteristics of the 'flawed hero' that very much makes the viewer root for him.

If you can sit back and enjoy something without getting caught up in nuances like how believable the story line is, then Season One of 24 is definately worth purchasing in my opinion.",1173830400,2,1312,4.719298245614035

Not a year ago I asked the very same question and then I bought the first season of 24. By the end of it I wondered how I could've possibly missed it on TV. Then I bought the rest of the series.

From the pioneering split screen perspective, now commonplace on our screens (ie: Trial and Retribution), to quality script and storylines, 24 has changed the way we look at TV. Highly original in format and pace there's nothing quite like it.

In a nutshell it's 24 hours in the life of Jack Bauer, operative with Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. The plot...well I can tell you nothing for fear of ruining every breathtaking twist and turn.

1521061,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" es la mejor serie de accion de la television actual, y de las mejores de todos los tiempos. El formato de tiempo real -muy escazamente utilizado en el cine- es llevado con exito a la television, que se centra en la crisis que abarca exactamente 24 horas en la vida de Jack Bauer- un Kiefer Sutherland en su mejor momento y me temo felizmente ya felizmente encasillado en tan fabuloso personaje- quien acude a todo tipo de maniobras generalmente violentas, al margen de la ley para lograr su proposito, sin importar los costos humanos y medios. Esta vez, en su temporada inagural, Jack se encuentra atrapado entre el rapto de su adolescente hija Kim y un complejo plan para asesinar a un popular senador norteamericano. Ademas, Jack estara a merced de posibles traidores dentro de su propia arma, la CTU-Unidad de Contra Terrorismo. La adrenalina correra a borbotones en el cuerpo de todos los involucrados, mientras Jack tratara de demostrar su inocencia, salvar a su familia, proteger al senador, descubrir a los traidores, y cazar a los complotadores. Dejando de lado toda la moralina sobre si es correcto o no el proceder de Jack, la serie es altamente recomendable, imprecindible para la gente que gusta de una violencia mas intensa, ""realista"" (nada de pistoleros de fantasia, con pistolas que nunca se quedan sin sus balas magicas), las tramas inteligentes que tienen mas giros que una montaa rusa y llenas de cliffhangers como una excelente serial antigua, y los contiunos sobresaltos frente al televisor, sin olvidar a estos personajes bien delineados, sean heroes o villanos, mas grandes que la vida misma. Nunca he visto la serie en sus emisiones semanales en la tv, y me fui de frente a los dvds. La presentacion de la caja con los 6 DVDs -que contiene los 24 episodios excelentemente grabados- es muy atractiva (super fotos de los protagonistas) y viene acompaada de un booklet que detalla la trama hora a hora, a manera de guia para no perderse. Viene acompaada de interesantimos extras, con documentales y cosas asi, pero las escenas editadas y el final alternativo valen oro. Lo bueno para mi: vienen con subtitulos al espaol (gracias, chicos).Despues de ver el primer capitulo, uno queda irremediblemente enganchado no solo para esta temporada, sino para todas las siguientes. A no perderse ""24"" la primera temporada, pero antes de verla asegurese tener bastante comida y ponerse comodo, pues se quedara pegado a la pantalla un buen tiempo. Y desde ya, vaya juntando dinero para las demas temporadas. No me cree? Ya vera.",1173312000,,2542,4.941588785046729
1521062,4,B00005JLF2,"I happened to watch season four of 24 a few weeks ago which was my first exposure to the show.  Had to watch the whole thing in just a few days.  I immediately bought the first season and have finally finished watching it.  If you can handle constant, on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement, quite a bit of bloody violence, and a few suggestive sexual scenes, this is the movie for you.  I love long movies - the longer the better.  It helps to develop the characters and, especially with 24, it helps to develop the intricate plots.  This is a TV series rather than a movie, but it goes together well enough to be called a 24 hour long movie.  I have family members who love to point out the theatrics and unrealistic parts (cars that obviously would have to be packed with explosives to make the huge fireball effect that is shown, etc), but I like to watch a movie for its surface excitement, so I loved it.  There are only two drawbacks - this is not a show for kids, so if you have them, you have to find time to watch without them and if you are like me, you will have a hard time turning it off, so you will have some very long movie sessions.  I have already purchased Season 2.....",1172102400,,1187,4.286995515695067
1521063,5,B00005JLF2,"Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Baurer and this first season it's one tough and painful long day he has to go through. His wife and daughter are taken by people who want to use that to get him to do whatever they want. For starters they'd like him to kill David Palmer who is the first black man who has a good chance of becoming president.

  Every season has great twists and turns but I think this still just might be the most solid and well made season. I admit though that it can be annoying how much trouble the wife and daughter get themselves into. Fans have complained a lot about how much trouble the daughter Kim always got herself into in this season and season 2. But I think the wife was kind of worse. It's kinda a good thing she's only in one season because she wasn't really the best character. I mean it's kinda silly that she loses her memory for a short time because she thinks that Kim died. So she's pretty much the only bad thing about this season.

  Otherwise it's a great season with an awesome appearance by Dennis Hopper as the main villian. He was so good that I sorta wish he could come back some how lol. Plus you also have a very well done twist at the end with someone close to Jack actually turning out to be bad. So I highly doubt anyone saw that coming. If you only have seen the latest seasons, I highly recommend that you check this one out.",1171843200,,1379,4.204545454545454

I don't know... the image was cool and I started wondering about the series.  I work at night so I hardly ever see prime-time TV.  I ordered seasons one to try it out.  I loved it.  It took a little while to get into (unlike the other seasons) but the show was awesome.  I highly recommend it.",1171756800,,516,4.204081632653061

We watched all five seasons of Alias last year over Christmas break and thought we would check out 24 this year.  Although the series is very different than Alias, it is just as good and just as exciting.  Jack is a true hero.  I've heard say that Jack Bauer's tears can cure cancer - too bad he's never cried!!",1171497600,,418,4.1875
1521066,5,B00005JLF2,"I just started watching season six of 24 and I was instantly drawn in. I decided to buy the first season and watch it while watching season six. At first I was not sure about season one. Though soon it started getting better and better. I was loving the season until the last few seconds in the last episode. I could not belive what happened. After that I watched the alternate ending that came with the season. I liked it better than the original ending, but I thought the original ending worked. It made the season end with a bang and I like that. The DVDs were good though they didn't include a ""previously on 24"". I was okay with it, but I think it could have helped. Also there was no ""play all"", but once again I never use. The one thing I was not happy about was that they did not include chapters in the episode. I could only fastforward or rewind. I could not skip ahead or back in the episode. Loved the season and the DVDs were good. It was worth the money.",1170633600,,968,4.181818181818182
1521067,5,B00005JLF2,"I never bothered with this series until viewing a panel discussion with 24 creater, actors on show, and writers for series. The primary reason for lack of interest was Kiefer Sutherland was main lead in series and had never been impressed with his work. I apologize to Mr. Sutherland because he is plays Jack Bauer with perfection.

Besides the format, what makes this series different from others. To steal a line from character in series: ""Jack is a stone cold killer."" I knew Jack was not the everyday TV hero when he gunned down the principal bad guys with no speeches or pretense of giving them a chance to kill him.

Another difference is nobody on the show is safe from being killed. Seasons One and Two saw the loss of regular good guy characters and Three was a wholesale slaughter for Jack's side. He dispatched one himself.

If Bush had a Jack Bauer, his presidency would be in much better shape.",1170547200,,907,4.58641975308642
1521068,5,B00005JLF2,"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).

Season 1 was good. It set the bar, which subsequent seasons have subsequently surpassed. I highly suggest watching the season in order. Some things in later seasons don't completely make sense unless you've seen the prior seasons. Though, enough lip service is paid to previous seasons that it's not a complete hardship if you haven't seen them. Still... Good to see the whole thing start to finish.

Story's good. Has a few ""suspension of disbelief"" moments (more so than usual, though obviously for much of the series you have to suspend disbelief to watch the exploits of nearly-invincible super-agent Jack Bauer), and a few hokey moments. But overall, an enjoyable attention-grabbing ride.

As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 1, as I recall, was a bit light on bonus materials. Subsequent seasons included more bonus features. As I recall, season 1 didn't chapter-break its episodes. But, the video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.

Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.",1170288000,,1993,4.958083832335329

Even though there is plenty going on, it still seems boring and I find myself just wanting to fast forward to the end.

I won't ruin the ending if you have been living in a closet and don't know how the first season ends-- I didn't know when I watched it-- but you will be extremely disappointed in how they ""wrap up"" the season finale.

1521241,5,B00005JLF2,"Except for Season 3, every season of 24 is worth renting but I think season 1 is the only season truly worth owning. Why?

Well, to note the obvious, this is the beginning of the show and so unlike the other seasons, we're not supposed to know stuff that happened last year (or, in 24 lingo, the last ""day""). We don't know who Jack Bauer is and we don't know what CTU is, but we learn as the story unfolds.

The plot is small but very effective. The life of one presidential candidate (not a major city or the world) is in mortal danger by terrorists who intend to kill him sometime in the next 24 hours and it is up to the counter-terrorist agent, Jack Bauer, to stop them.

Big deal, right? Well, you're going to be very surprised and pleased how many twists and turns this story has.

The beginning is essentially perfect. Some fans of the later seasons of 24 might grow restless because it moves slowly. But this is smart because it draws you in, develops the characters and, unlike later seasons, actually makes the story believable because, if this were the real world, you wouldn't expect something astonishing happening to Jack every 5 minutes. It successfully creates a gritty atmosphere of suspicion where we're not always sure who's good or bad and where there are not always happy endings.

For the first season of a show I was surprised at how good the acting was. Except for possibly one or two characters they all give very believable performances and the chemistry is superb. If 24 Season 1 was a movie I would actually expect several Oscar nominations dished out to this group. Besides Kiefer Sutherland I was especially impressed by Sarah Clarke who plays Jack's loyal colleague Nina Myers.

I really don't want to say more beyond that but I will repeat to you some wise advise that I heard before I bought this season:

DO NOT read any more reviews on this show because some jerk might reveal a major spoiler. Do not even read the episode guide that comes with this DVD set. Just close the blinds, sit back, and be blown away.",1168473600,4,2045,4.510810810810811

It spends too much time with the Kim Bauer character who is a whiney, wimpy, loud, obnoxious teenager. Jack deserves better. I guess she is there to get the teen boy audience to tune in or closet child molesters. As to the DVD, the plot line is turgid and the acting is uninspiring. If I had started out with year 1 I would not have gotten any farther. As it were I could only get through the first three CDs before trashing it. Year 2 is much, much better.

While the overall production quality seemed above average for network TV, the plot was thin and very predictable.  The other problem with this show is that every character except for Jack Bauer is incredibly annoying. They either are incredibly incompetant (everyone at CTU), in their job positions, are way too naive and are constantly making terrible decisions (jack's family), or are just plain annoying (Palmer's wife).  The endless subplots with Jack's family were over the top and ridiculous.  How hard is it to transport somebody without them getting kidnapped multiple times? It was also annoying that nobody in CTU was able to accomplish anything because their superiors were constantly denying their requests.  I guess the writers were trying to add to how far the corruption would go, but they did a pretty bad job as it was really obvious as to who was bad and who was good from the first few episodes.  Eventually I found myself fast-forwarding every scene involving Sen. Palmer and his family and those involving Jack's family because I just didn't care anymore.  24 is a lot better and different than shows on the major networks, but if you want to see a good show watch The Shield, The Wire, or Battlestar Galactica on cable.",1166313600,10,1339,4.850877192982456

Kiefer Sutherland is by far the best actor in television.  His character, Jack Bauer, is one of the greatest characters ever.

The first couple of episodes of season one take a little while to get into, but once it starts picking up, your in for a head first dive into quality suspense.  Each character is very real.  Jack's wife Terri and his daughter Kim are very good.  I find, however, that the best person in the show besides Jack Bauer is Senator David Palmer, played by Dennis Haysbert.

I remember when 24 first began.  The show didn't do quite as well as Fox had wanted, but by the second season the show really took off and there's been no looking back since then.",1162166400,,568,4.63
1521380,3,B00005JLF2,"Season one of 24 is a good show, to a point. The plot starts out very good, but becomes very circular. As soon as a sub plot is completed, the writers send you back to the same sub plot. I'm not going to go into too much detail, so that I don't give it away for those of you who want to see it. 24 season one could have been so much better if it had stayed closer to Jack.

Many of the characters are good, but a lot of them look and act the same way. Jack's wife looks too much like his second in command, and both are a bit wimpy. Palmer's son is too short sighted and his wife is the clich of a bad wife.

If the other seasons must have been better, or I don't see how that stayed on the air as long as it did. I'm disappointed!",1162166400,,731,3.74025974025974
1521381,5,B00005JLF2,"This show rocks! I've watched up to season three and i've seen reruns from other seasons. It just keeps getting better and better! No other tv show has the quality of this one! The acting is near flawless,the writing is perfect,and the production values are top-notch! The first season focuses on the kidnapping of the hero(Jack Bauer)'s wife and daughter and his efforts to rescue them while at the same time protecting a senator named David Palmer from being murdered. And from the first few minutes of this real time drama,we are hooked. While the first season is great programming,the other seasons are even better! The only downside of this show for certain people may be the violence. While there are worse things out there,this show can get pretty intense. So don't watch it unless you are prepared for an intense ride. Also,this dvd doesn't hit high in the extras department.the only extra of merit is the alrenate ending on the last disc. However,all the other seasons come packed with extras! So,if you want to watch the finest series ever with the greatest hero ever,buy this along with season two because as soon as you watch one season you'll immediately want the next one!",1161734400,,1186,4.818627450980392
1521382,4,B00005JLF2,"This critically acclaimed series got off to a good start, with Kiefer Sutherland shouldering his complex lead role quite nicely.  In watching 24's first season sequentially over a five day period, one can see that the series is really a soap opera with guns, and lots of dead bodies.  The characters do some pretty stupid things, with Sutherland's daughter (a whiny Elisha Cuthbert) topping the list of dumbdoers with her Stockholm syndrome affection for a basically worthless guy who she thinks is okay because he helps her and mommy escape; but he's the one that got her in the mess in the first place.  Cuthbert continues to do stupid things that eventually end up in getting more people killed and her father and mother in further danger.  The disassociative amnesia plot with wife Leslie Hope is also a real hard concept to accept.  Dennis Haysbert as the African/American presidential hopeful plays his role with stoic power, but his family problems tend to get tedious and repetitive, with his wife being a real pain in the buttuski (although Penny Jarold is quite good in the role).  Sarah Clarke as Sutherland's sidekick Nina is quite good as is Carlos Bernard as her beau Tony.  The cast overall is exceptional:  Xander Berkeley, Richard Burgi, Zeljo Ivanek, even Dennis Hopper with his horrible Bulgarian accent is effective.  Credit goes to the writers/directors for keeping things addictively entertaining, although the last episode is quite shocking in its revelations.  All in all, 24 was a unique attempt at intelligent drama and succeeded on the most part.  On to day 2, now, huh?",1159228800,,1597,4.966165413533835
1521383,4,B00005JLF2,"The first season of 24 is the best, which is saying something because all of them are great.  It is intense, fast paced, and not confusing like so many contemporary action shows and movies are.  Do not buy this if you cannot afford to buy all of the seasons, because you will end up doing just that.",1159056000,,299,4.228070175438597
1521384,2,B00005JLF2,"I purchased Season One, never having seen a single episode, on the strength of a friend's recommendation, and watched it in its entirety over the span of about ten evenings. I stuck with it only because my wife enjoyed it and I didn't want to be a spoilsport, which required that I suppress my urge to laugh out loud at the outlandish plot twists, which were many, and the cardboard characters.

There is not a moment of Season One that I found believable. Start with the production values, which are strictly made-for-TV. Little of the series appears to be filmed on location, and the obvious sound stage and back lot settings set a tone of artificiality that, given the plotting, is probably appropriate. Note how Bauer's wife and daughter seemingly can run miles eluding their kidnappers and never break a sweat. And because so many of the scenes are filmed on a sound stage, the lighting is often intrusively unrealistic. (In one scene, one of Victor Drazen's sons is talking face to face with Bauer's daughter, and as the camera switches from one to the other, it is always the right side of their faces that is illuminated.)

The plot reminds me of a Robert Ludlum novel in which the hero is confronted by a sinister, shadowy organization whose reach is unlimited and whose minions are everywhere.  Gosh, to whom can a hero turn in such circumstances?  Why, to the writers! One can usually bank on a kidnapping and an escape, but here there seems to be an endless series of each.  Why is a farfetched escape from a 747 - which is destroyed in the process, killing all passengers - required to secure the credentials of a photographer, who is later replaced by a double, when Drazen's all-powerful organization should easily have been able to eliminate the photographer and make the swap after his arrival in LA? Why would the government build an elaborate, secret detention facility, and instead of locating it at a secure site, put it under - yes, under - a tract of farmland to which anyone, apparently, has access?  (A facility so secret it takes CTU staff all of about a minute to access a detailed map of it.) The absurdities peak when Bauer's wife and daughter are escaping from their kidnappers in a car, and his wife pulls off on a side road and exits the car, telling her daughter ""I'll see if they're still following us."" As she begins to trot down the road to check things out (exactly what she would do if they were still being followed is anybody's guess), the car, with daughter inside, rolls over an embankment (oooops!) and down into a ravine, where it bursts into flames. Seeing this, Ma Bauer collapses, and when she revives - ta-da! - she's suffering from traumatic amnesia! If you can watch this plot twist without laughing out loud, you're a better man than I.  It goes without saying that daughter Bauer miraculously survives all this, only to face... that's right, yet another kidnapping.

Just when it appears that the script couldn't get more hokey (my apologies to any Virginia Tech alumni reading this), the writers turned to casting for their pice de rsistance: Dennis Hopper as the Serbian war criminal Victor Drazen, whose desire for revenge set all this malarkey in motion.  I'll wager that every community theater group from Portland to Poughkeepsie has at least one member who could have played credibly the part of Victor Drazen, as written, and whose anonymity would have worked to the role's favor (as it did for the character Gaines). Instead, we get Dennis Hopper, who, in this role, is never for a second anyone but Dennis Hopper. (There is a point early in his time on screen when I thought Hopper was struggling to keep a straight face, when I thought he might laugh out loud and say, ""sorry, guys, this is the best Serbian accent I can do.""  But, trooper that he is, Hopper sucked it up and soldiered on.)  Finally, the fact the action unfolds in real time added nothing - I found it to be an empty gimmick.

Compared to the drivel the networks - ABC, CBS, NBC - turn out, ""24"" may merit four stars, perhaps five, but when judged next to ""The Wire,"" or even ""The Shield,"" two stars is generous.",1159056000,20,4142,4.635743519781719
1521385,5,B00005JLF2,"Look out. This thing is as seductively addictive as, well, chocolate flavored caffeinated drinks with ginger snaps on the side. And it should come with a warning: do not commence viewing unless you have large chunks of time you can spare. Because, like a junkie losing it all to Mistress Heroin, you will put your life on hold to watch ""just one more hour"".

What a clever notion: a tense espionage thriller teleplay involving timely issues and plot developments, happening in real time; each episode being one hour of a hell of an event packed twenty-four hour period. In Season One, hero Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), the head of the Los Angeles bureau of a Federal anti-terrorism division, must deal with a credible threat to a presidential candidate at the same time that his wife and daughter are kidnapped.  Are the two situations related? Is anyone inside the bureau involved? The writing is tight, the acting well done, and the cinematography and stage direction excellent.

Plus Jack has the coolest stuff in his car.  Homage to Q, no doubt.

I was fortunate, in a weird way. The six disc set arrived just as I had busted up my shoulder and had to remain still for several days. No problem. Prop the portable DVD player on the pillow and trance out. For hours at a time.  Drool. Bring her up for food and aspirin, fellas!

Clearly I was a 24 Virgin prior to viewing this epic season.  Season Two is en route, and I can't wait. And frankly, I don't know if I can watch the new season on telly, as I'm spoiled by being able to watch it in sequential four hour nonstop sessions.

1521387,5,B00005JLF2,"This show has been out for a while and I just recently got around to watching it.  I don't watch a whole lot of television and this show looked like it was trying to just cash in on post-9/11 paranoia, so I did my best to avoid it.  I caught a glimpse of a few episodes that a friend was watching and enjoyed it though, so I picked up season 1.

I was very pleasantly suprised.  The show's gimmick, as you probably heard, is that everything happens real time, and it spans a 24-hour period.  The real-time aspect is pulled off quite well.  I do think the story got stretched thin in a few places though; 2-4 hours of the plot could have been gutted/changed to better effect.

The show doesn't rely on constant cliffhangers between episodes to make you want to keep watching (though it does do that once or twice), in fact it usually resolves something of importance right at the end.  It just captivates you and makes you genuinely want to know what happens next.

The pacing, action and suspense are all well done.  The characters themselves are great (though the two wives, Jack's and Palmer's did grate on me), if slightly overdone when it comes to the ""real"" masterminds behind the plot.

There aren't many special features to speak of.  There's an alternate ending I didn't care for, and a short introduction by Kiefer Sutherland (oddly placed on the final disc instead of the first).  But in this case I don't care, since it is already 18 hours worth of excellent television.",1157932800,,1481,4.522556390977444
1521475,4,B00005JLF2,"I like the 24 series, but the DVDs for Seasons 1-4 have a problem that almost every sub-screen for each episode is a spoiler for what will happen in that episode.  Even the opening menu sequence for season 3 gave away secrets.  So while the show is great, I'd recommend not looking at the scene shots that are part of the DVD menus.  I haven't watched Season 5 on DVD, so I'm unsure if it suffers too.",1157760000,,401,4.181818181818182
1521476,5,B00005JLF2,"The reason I say that is oddly enough, I'm actually a fan of Veronica Mars and Desperate Housewives, 2 shows primarily driven by women. Any guy mentioning they're a fan and you either get a ""that's cool man"" with a snickering later or you meet the progressive type that doesn't care and knows a good show when they see it. 24 in many ways is a show made by guys, largely starring guys and for guys, with some females getting in on it too. While it still suffers from the occasional implausibility(more on that later) it's still quite a compelling show.

Jack Bauer works at CTU, Counter Terrorist Unit. One night he's called in because there's going to be an assassination attempt on David Palmer's life, the only African-American senator who has a real shot at the US Presidency. Through many many twists and turns, Bauer tries to uncover who's behind the attempt and stopping them, all in the space of 24 hours.

By now you know the concept: 24 episodes in a season, each one taking up one hour of an entire day(well, 40 minutes since there's no commercials). Ordinarily, this wouldn't work but somehow the writers manage to keep things enthralling without having things seem implausible although there are exceptions. First forget about the fact ALL this stuff takes place in the span of 24 hours. Characters don't really seem affected as far as sleep or washrooms are concerned, then there's some story turns that seem like ""oh come on..."" and while I won't spoil it, a sudden case of....something just comes out of the blue.

One thing I love about shows like Smallville, The X-Files or the Simpsons is that I can watch any episode in any order and still be entertained for that time. However, shows like 24, Alias or Lost practically require you to watch from the beginning. While all the episodes are captivating, it's rare for you to pick out a certain episode and re-watch it; it's like starting a book on chapter 7.  While it's not a terrible blow to the show, repeated viewings usually warrant you to watch everything, rather than pick and choose.

For every blunder a network has done like cancelling Freaks and Geeks, Wonderfalls, Joan of Arcadia or Firefly, now and then they get it right so kudos to Fox. Becoming a huge cult show with a loyal(sometimes too loyal maybe) fanbase, it's obvious that 24 was meant to be a big show. Forgot all the impossible sounding aspects of the show and you'll find yourself hooked quite fast.",1156982400,,2442,4.669767441860465
1521477,5,B00005JLF2,"Is this the best series of 24? Probably, if only because of the skill and effort needed to devise the plot and the characters for the first time. But this is a magnificent story with so many different plot lines going on simultaneously. There's even some fantastic tension among the senator's family who spend almost the entire 24 hours hanging around in a hotel.

-- SPOILER WARNING: do not read on if you haven't already seen the series.

You can get a 100% accurate idea of who survives this series simply by looking at the DVD box covers of the subsequent series. There are a large number of deaths in this story, and many of them are incredibly callous in their execution. The one at the very end is almost unbelievable, because the victim just wanders into the wrong place at the wrong time. I wonder if the producers were certain right at the very start of the production that this particular murder was going to happen.

The construction of deceit throughout this series is fantastically well done. You have to watch the series through a second time, once you know who the CTU traitors are, to see how subtly their second-thoughts reactions are portrayed. For example: the only clue you get that the (first) dead girl's father isn't who he says he is comes when he and Terry Bauer arrive at the furniture shop and he fails to recognise his own daughter's car. Miss that -- and nearly everyone does, first time through -- and you get a nasty surprise a couple of hours later.

On a more philosophical level, the thing I dislike about 24 is the implication that some lives are worth a lot more than others. An enormous number of people lose their lives in this story to protect the senator's family and Jack Bauer's family. I question whether it was really worth it.

But Jack Bauer is America's James Bond (same initials, too), and you just have to accept a huge death toll with both.

The only other thing I dislike about this series is that the split down the middle, when the second production team takes over at 14.00, is rather visible.  Jack has just rescued his family, they're sitting together exhausted in the helicopter, and it all feels rather the end of Jurassic Park.  It could have ended there.  The second story doesn't quite have the impact of the first half.

Finally, in case anyone was wondering, the Andrea Newman who wrote and/or produced several of these episodes is not the same Andrea Newman who wrote UK TV's 'Bouquet of Barbed Wire' in the 1970s.",1156723200,2,2479,4.588235294117647

1521535,5,B00005JLF2,"24, Season One in particular, is meant to be watched as a whole.  No one can just watch one episode, because after one, you become hooked.  So do yourself a favor and start from the beginning.

The beginning.  It's slow.  Oh, it's slow.  Not bad, but slow.  Viewers, as you watch the first few episodes, keep in mind that Season One escalates into an explosive and emotional journey, in which you truly get to know Jack Bauer, and (to a lesser extent) David Palmer.

Jack is a brilliant character, and his emotions become yours.  The pacing of this season is brilliant, as is the climatic finale.  The face off of Jack and the main villain (no spoilers in this review) is amazing, and the final moments of the season will leave your heart beating fast, and your eyes leaking tears.  The family love and (ironically) togetherness is essential to the core of the season, and helps strengthen the viewers tie to the characters.

This is an amazing start to the best series of modern television.

1521536,5,B00005JLF2,"Overall, I do not spend very much time watching television. I find most of the shows just plain boring and predictable. So, when I heard all of the hype about 24 I figured it was just the flavor of the month. I never got a chance to watch, mostly because it seemed I was always busy when the season started, and it just felt wrong to sit down in the middle of the day. So, thanks got the magic of TV shows on DVD I finally decided to see what the hype about this show was about.

I would actually say that this show deserves all the hype it was received. The story is one of the most engaging I have ever seen for a TV show and it plays out better than most movies. One of my favorite parts about the shows is just the fact that you never completely know what is going to happen. When you watch a lot of these shows, you often times expect so called ""plot twists"" and characters to change allegiance and the like. However, this show manages to pull it off so even though you are expected it, it still manages to surprise you when it happens.

My main complaint is what most other people say- Jack's daughter absolutely annoys me. After awhile, I was hoping the terrorists would just take her out so she wouldn't get kidnapped any more.

1521538,4,B00005JLF2,"An outstanding series, 24, brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) four characters: Jack Bauer, Terri Bauer, Kim Bauer, and Senator David Palmer.

The setting is Los Angeles on the day of the Democratic California Primary and Federal (CTU) agent Jack Bauer is trying to thwart an assassination attempt against presidential hopeful Senator Palmer.  Things get a little more complicated when his family gets drawn into it...

Kiefer Sutherland, Sarah Clark (who is GORGEOUS!), Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard and most the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.  Moreover, 24 does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) The whole car-falling-over-the-cliff with the daughter in it was too much.

2) It gets worse when Kim not only survives the fall, but is also in great shape!!!

3) If that wasn't bad enough, the wife suffers from amnesia (!!!) in typical soap opera fashion... Shameful!

4) Dennis Hopper's sad attempt at a Serbian accent, which ended up being more an Italian one....

5) The ridiculous escape from the dock by making use of hot coffee!

6) The completely useless daughter.

7) The very annoying wife.

8) The involvement of Serbs (the Drazens) and the implication of Russians (Yelena) and Greeks (!) (Harris) as villains.  Not to mention that Germany is also somehow involved.  How original...

On the positive side:

1) 24 Sheds light on illegal covert operations carried out within the FR of Yugoslavia and aiming at assassinating people on US Government orders in 1999.

2) Kiefer Sutherland and Sarah Clark have an amazing chemistry, while Dennis Haysbert and Carlos Bernard were born for their respective roles.

3) A good, yet short guest appearance by Lou Diamond Philips.

4) Good moral story with the senator doing the right thing in relation to his wife in the end.

5) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""

6) A good look into the dirty world of politics.

In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1152748800,6,2445,5.004962779156328

1521540,5,B00005JLF2,"On the day of the California Presidential Primary, Special Agent Jack Bauer is called into the office of the Las Angelos Counter Terrorist Unit. He's briefed on an assassination threat to a major Presidential Candidate: Senator David Palmer. Agent Bauer soon learns that there may be an element inside his agency who are supporting the hit. Not knowing who to trust, Jack carries out his assignment to the best of his ability. Except the thought of his wife searching for their missing teenage daughter is a major distraction. Over the next twenty four hours, Bauer will discover how connected these two incidents in his life really are. And the clock is ticking....

Kiefer Sutherland assumes the role of Special Agent Jack Bauer, and gives an amazing, Emmy Award-winning performance. Sutherland brings such different sides to one's humanity in the character and this pulls the viewer into seeing what happens next. This season has outstanding filming techniques and great editing. These aspects to the show received Emmy Nomminations, and rightfully so. The show's score is written by Sean Callery, and his take on music is perfection. He also won an Emmy for his musical contribution. The writers have a simple but very interesting story to tell, and it holds pretty well for a twenty four episode season. The most intriguing part to the entire show, is that it is in Real-Time Format. This however does cause a few problems in sub-storylines. The character of Teri Bauer is soon a drag on the main story, and it is clear that the writers did not know what to do with her midseason. They do redeem the show in last eight hours with a major twist to the main story. 24 SEASON ONE, is so well put together that it does not really feel like a television show. All the episodes are so connected in succession, that the season feels more like an eighteem hour movie, than a twenty four episode season. 24 SEASON ONE is a must see thrill ride!",1152489600,8,1940,4.756676557863502
1521541,3,B00005JLF2,"Okay folks, it's about time someone said it.  The wildly popular series ""24"" is an entertaining show marred by a streak of misogyny that can't be ignored.  I proudly count myself among the ever-growing number of neo-feminists who are trying to fight the man (quite literally).

I'm not going to spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the show (unlike many of the reviews found here, shame on you all).  But the truth is, without exception, the primary female characters -- Jack's wife, Jack's daughter, and Jack's co-worker Nina, and Palmer's wife -- are all portrayed as either clueless, heartless, helpless, or worse.  On the other hand, the male characters do the decision-making.  They are shown as unwavering in their conviction to ""do the right thing.""  The male characters - mostly Jack and Palmer - are the barometers of virtue.  It's all rather unsettling in this day and age - especially since no one (but me) seems willing to point it out.

If you can get past that (as millions have), the show is admittedly pretty entertaining.  The plot devices show a lack of inspiration sometimes in the second half of this first season, ideas get repeated.  The casting of Dennis Hopper in a significant role was a poor one, as Mr. Hopper chews the scenery unrelentingly - sticking out like a sore thumb amidst the rather subtle work of the rest of the cast.

My wife and I watched it ALL in only a few days, as it became one of the most addicting shows I have ever seen.  There is a perfect amount of action and suspense and Keifer Sutherland has never been better.  He has always been solid in movies throughout his career, but then we didn't see him for awhile.  What a comeback!  He will now always be known for Jack Bauer and it's hard to imagine anyone else screaming into a cell phone, ""MR. PRESIDENT!!!""  Of course, Jack's daughter is annoying (as always!) in this season, but plays a more believable role (than say, working for CTU on computers!).  Nina is great, President Palmer is great, and so is Jack's wife.  The great thing about 24, and definitely proved in this season, is that anything can happen.  Sure, Jack won't die, but anyone else can at any time.  Do yourself a favor.  If you have not seen 24 yet, go out and buy Season 1 AND Season 2 right away.

What a waste of time it ended up being. Sure, each episode ends with a cliffhanger, but the whole story is so far fetched, and so over the top, that I quickly grew quite bored by it. In fact, I was surprised at how much I dislked this series.

I haven't given any of the other seasons a chance, but after seeing this first season, I doubt that I will. However, based on the reviews here and elsewhere, my opinion is obviously very much in the minority.

For a far more engaging series that also deals with counter terrorism, check out the BBC's ""MI-5"" (a.k.a. ""Spooks"") - also available on DVD from Amazon.com.",1151366400,9,694,4.364341085271318
1521578,5,B00005JLF2,"You don't need me to tell you what the show was about, how it's organized, etc. In fact, you'd do better to avoid all of the other reviews (and the ""product description"" above) and know only that it's a sensationalist political/terrorist thriller that purportedly happens in real time. Anything else would be giving away plot devices and twists and turns that would diminish your enjoyment. (I will, though, mention one odd one that I don't see in other reviews: the use of cell phones to continue dialogue and keep characters ""in play"" while they move from one location to another.)

What you DO need me to tell you is that the ""real time"" aspect is a stretch you shouldn't get too caught up in. Since I live in LA, and have travelled many of the routes covered in each of these seasons, I can pretty much guarantee that the travel times are often BS. I can also assure you that some of the cell calls (see above) wouldnt happen as they're depicted, because of lousy cell coverage in some of the locations. (Jack's phone may not be a conventional cell phone, but several other characters' are.)

You also may need me to tell you that while Season One was blisteringly exciting and gripping, from the first scene to the last, the other seasons diminished radically in entertainment value. Season two involved several false starts that didn't add much except and episode or two of confusion. Season three includes some absurd side plots that went nowhere fast and then ""back to square one"" (an overused phrase anywhere, including in this series). I started watching Season Four but, frankly, gave up. The plot connections were growing thin, the character backgrounds had begun to be overplayed, the emphasis on Jack has hero didn't pan out as clearly as the network's obvious need to keep Keifer in the mix - and I wasn't going to risk wasting any more time on episodes that didn't add to the story line.

So, get Season One. Definitely. Maybe even watch in straight through, in 24 hours (taking the 7-minutes-per-half-hour commercial reductions for bathroom breaks, snacks, naps, and/or reflection). Consider watching the second season - and skip the other two unless you're just insanely bored and can't find something better to do with your life - which, one might argue, would be sad. :)",1150416000,,2290,4.777777777777778

Watching on TV week to week, this would drive me nuts.  On DVD, it's hard to stop watching.  If you like Dan Brown's novels like ""Angels and Demons"" and ""Da Vinci Code"", 24 keeps the twists going in a very similar way.

Even if you haven't seen an episode of this on TV, you probably heard *of* it, and undoubtedly the concept behind it. Yes, it's pretty intriguing, and that's what pulled me into renting the whole season to watch over an idle weekend. Maybe I was too worked up, but `24' definitely lacks the polish of other popular TV shows, especially those from the HBO productions. While most of the episodes are quite entertaining, some of the events in the story are simply implausible... and they WILL glare at you and beg for your suspension of disbelief. I would say the same for the characters. They are very one-dimensional, which yields to easy storytelling but rather poor in the department of earning credibility or your empathy.

On the brighter side, you *will* be entertained for 24 hours. I would give this 3.5 stars if I had a choice, but it deserves a 4 more than a 3 for it's unique concept and reasonably good delivery of it.",1150243200,,986,4.564971751412429

See, on the plan I have on NetFlix, I can only get 3 DVDs per time, and I was watching them at a rate that my NetFlix queue couldn't keep up with, so I ended up coming onto Amazon and buying seasons 1 and 2 with overnight shipping.. Expensive, yes, but it enabled me to watch the show whenever I wanted..

If you want really good TV that really gets you thinking, 24 is definitely the show to watch, at times, it gets a little unrealistic, but usually they patch things up with some sort of explanation later on of why something happened..

Out of my family of five, we all have different tastes in television/movies, usually we all clash on these sorts of things, however, four out of the five of us got hooked on this show, with the fifth not liking action and watching very little TV as it is.

It was certainly a highly entertaining show with no end to the action.  It contains murder, espionage, terrorism, traitors, kidnapping and a presidential assassination plot.  And that is all in one day.

The concept of the show is that each episode represents one hour of a day in real time.  The hero, federal anti terrorist agent Jack Bauer, encounters more action in two hours than any 50 average people do in their entire lives.

Although some of the events are certainly implausible in the time frames allotted, it is great entertainment.  Although I am not much of a TV watcher, I may just become one for this show.  I recommend it.",1149206400,,820,4.47972972972973
1521623,5,B00005JLF2,"Wow, there's just too much to say when talking about this TV show.  It is easily my favorite show on TV right now, Season 5 is going great right now with only 2 more hours left.  I've heard about this show in the past but never really thought much about it or even bothered to watch it.  Each season has a total of 24 episodes and each episdode represents an hour in the day, hence the name 24.  The first time I saw an episode it was from the this 1st season when they were showing weekend reruns starting from the beginning of the series.  I was instantly hooked and I've never quit watching it since.

This season starts off with intelligence about a plot to assisinate Senator David Palmer being revealed.  Jack Bauer, head of CTU(Counter Terrorist Unit), is called in at midnight to investigate the case with his people.  Unfortunately, as the show goes on, more of the plot is uncovered and it turns out to be bigger than anyone ever thought it was.  Now Jack Bauer is going against the clock to save his kidnapped wife and daughter, uncover the mole in his agency and stop the assisination plot on the Senator.  This thriller will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you won't be disappointed.  I would suggest this DVD set to anyone and I do mean anyone who watches TV.  It's definitely worth your money...",1147824000,3,1338,4.394308943089431
1521624,5,B00005JLF2,"I've been a fan of The 4400 and Lost and when talking to others they kept saying, ""If you like those shows then you'll like 24.""  So, I finally hit he local video store and picked it up.

And if you can't tell from my five star rating, I'm very glad I did.

Keifer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the director of the CTU (Counter-Terrorism Unit), a division of the CIA.  His mission is to find a group of people determined to assassinate a potential presidential candidate.  However, word has also gotten to Jack that a leak may be present within the CTU.  To top it all off, Jack's personal life isn't going well as his daughter has ran off for a night of fun with a friend.

The interesting thing about this show is that each episode is done in real time.  A one hour episode is one hour of Jack Bauer's life.  Each episode runs back to back of each other so the 24 episodes is a one-day, 24-hour period of Jack Bauer's life.

One thing that I like this concept is that by the end of the ""day"" (season), nearly everything is wrapped up.  There is no hanging on the edge of your seats waiting for the next season to come along.  Nearly everything (everything important, anyways) is resolved.  You can tell that the entire season is thought out from beginning to end so the fear that I have with Lost and The 4400 doesn't exist with this show (there is a chance those shows will be taken off the air and the mysterys will remain unsolved).

This is also a fairly smart show.  It definately keeps you on your feet wondering what is going to happen next.  If you think you can predict how the season ends halfway through, you will be completely wrong.

This show is also pretty intense and with a lot of action.  The last episode has you on the edge of your seat the entire hour (I think I would have benefited form the commercials so I could catch my breath).

There are really only two shortcomings.  One is the real-time aspect of the show.  It amazes me how Jack Bauer can get anywhere in LA at anytime within 10 minutes without dealing with gridlock traffic.  Sometimes it seemed that things were done much more quickly than humanly possible.  Sometimes it seemed, especially between commercial breaks, that some things too continuous.

The other shortcoming is the reality of the show.  Deeper into the season the show gets a little bit more unrealistic and Jack Bauer seems to pull of the impossible way too often.  But there weren't too many so I still think the show deserves five stars.

So, like my friends, I highly recommend this show.  I've since watched the second season as well and found it just as enjoyable.  I can't wait to catch up and start following the show on TV.  I think this show will be fantastic when I am forced to wait a week or so between episodes.",1147564800,4,2776,4.386274509803922

1521626,5,B00005JLF2,"In an age where weak television and movies sell to all. Where brainless action and sex is the focus for every person in America, thank God that '24' is here.

Jack Bauer, played fantastically well by Kiefer Sutherland, is a US Government agent who spends several non-consecutive '24' hour days fighting to protect his family and his country. Written extremely well with an intense soundtrack, this show is what defines excellent television. Packed with an organized/well-developed plot and never-ending-drama, '24' is a show not to be missed; it definitely is not for the weak-stomached/minded. The only negative about '24' is missing an episode. But not to worry, viewers will be updated at the start of every episode.

'24' is to drama and action what Seinfeld is to comedy--the absolute best. What a great show and what better way to start watching it than with season 1? (arguably the best season.)",1145836800,4,902,5.006666666666667
1521627,4,B00005JLF2,"(Sigh)... I know that it's unfair that I compare everything to ""The Shield,"" my current standard-bearer for fantastic television.

But, that said, this first season of ""24"" is pretty damned good, and entertaining. I was a little unsure about how the writers were going to make a real-time drama work, and esPECially, how they were planning to stretch it out over 24 episodes. That's a long season for ANY show, let alone one whose plots HAVE to intersect every week.

Basically, Counterterrorist Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is initially out to keep a black presidential candidate safe from assassination. Before long, however, the plot involves Bauer's family, as well as a motive that has little to do with Palmer's quest for the White House.

However, as we got closer and closer to the end, things started to unravel a little. The final double-cross of the series, plain and simple, just doesn't make a lot of sense. Dennis Hopper does -- seriously -- a Count Dracula impression as a Serbian terrorist. His character's son -- I don't know his real name, but he played D.A. Ed Danvers on NBC's ""Homicide"" -- does a much better job with the accent.

CINEMA/TV GEEK TRIVIA: I don't know what shot first, this or the first season of ""The Shield,"" but there are a TON of ancillary characters from ""Shield"" on here, including:

- Palmer's son, who tried to kill Shane Vendrell in season three of ""The Shield.""

- Some Hispanic guy, who played the thorny-crown-tattoo-bearing leader of the Las Profetas gang, also in season three.

- The agent who led a team of agents Bauer busted played the Sperm-Saving Rapist on season one, as well as playing the cop who got his ear cut off in Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs.""

But all in all, this is a tightly-scripted drama that keeps you pretty much on the edge of your seat. Having started about four seasons too late, some of the cliffhangers aren't, well, as cliffhangy, because it's clear what their resolution will be. But that didn't stop me from going ""What the *$&! is gonna happen next?!"" a couple of times.

Most interesting to me was the transformation of Sen. David Palmer's wife, from the perfect politician's wife at the series' beginning, to a conniving, power-hungry player by the time it ends.

As I mentioned before, the final double-cross seems a bit hokey... maybe I need to re-watch some of the earlier episodes and see if I pick up on it. There is also a little bout with instant amnesia that is tough to believe, but it doesn't have all that much to do with the overall story.

Did I enjoy it? Sure. Is it better than ""The Shield,"" or HBO's ""The Wire?"" No, not really. But it was still very good, and considering the end of the first season, I think I'm beginning to see how Bauer's character takes a turn into darker psychological territory, and I think I'm interested to see how his next assignment works out...",1145836800,3,2888,4.699009900990099

After seeing Season 1 I can say that the only thing worthwhile about this thing is the novelty that it takes place in 24 hrs. Compared with 'The Shield' this is poor fare. Do you really believe that the world is better off with Baur stumbling about. People around him die and he remains. He leads a counter terrorist org. in which no one likes him. He breaks the rules but holds others accountable who act like him. He is a very poor judge of character in that the only ones he trusts in Season 1 are the traitors and moles. He is certainly no leader and shows no ability in that line. Baur's family are also dorks. They don't listen or obey any advice for their own safety and keep Baur more focused on them than his mission. His great mission against the Serbs concocted by the Senator now Democratic Presidential Candidate leaves no one alive but Baur--that figures. The Senator does not have much of a platform but aids and education. If the speeches he makes are written by that speech writer he has and later fires sounds like the people he talks to are also dorks.

His job is to thwart the attempt by all means necessary. This will be ""the longest 24 hours of his life.""

But the terrorists are aware of Jack and know he's assigned to root them out. We quickly learn that Jack's wife and daughter are in danger. They're swooped up by splinter cells of the terrorists and locked away. Now they have some leverage against Jack, and they're going to use it. But they underestimate him. Having been trained in Special Forces before moving into law enforcement, Jack doesn't like being pushed against the wall. Fighting back is his only chance, for him, his family and the Presidential candidate.

Meanwhile, other storylines are coalescing with this one. The office of L.A.'s CTU may be rife with undercover agents for foreign terror groups. Jack and his wife were once on the outs and Jack became involved with Agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) - the second in command at CTU - for a very brief time. Senator David Palmer (the candidate) and his family are having a rough time; they're in the middle of the California primary and Mr. Palmer's wife is enamored with becoming the first lady ...so much so that she's willing to risk just about everything to get there. Palmer's son may also have been involved in the murder of a boy who raped his sister, and the news is just now beginning to break. Palmer's enemies are closing in, trying to kill him and to kill his run for President. And as this unfolds, we learn that Jack Bauer and David Palmer were once involved in a military operation (as subordinate and leader respectively) that killed a Kosovo terrorist ...and, by accident, his family. Or so they thought.

The family of the ""murdered"" man (Dennis Hopper, Speed 1994) may have infiltrated CTU and are prepared to do anything to get Senator Palmer and Jack Bauer.

______________________________________________________________________________

This first season of 24 developed almost a cult following. And there's good reason for it. This is acting well done and nonstop action at its finest. Just when a storyline starts winding down, they pump it back up with adrenaline. Keifer Sutherland (Jack Bauer) was a good choice for the lead character and all of the supporting cast are just as perfect for their roles (from Leslie Hope who plays Jack's wife to Dennis Haysbert who stars as Senator David Palmer, the Presidential candidate.)

The complaints surrounding the series are justified if a bit unrealistic. Most have centered on the lack of realism when it comes to travel times in L.A.; the 24 hour screenwriters put everything at 15 minutes away from everything else in the big city. This is true, they do. But when you have to cover one hour per episode, you can see why they did this; they only have so much time to get new plots across and keep the story moving at a decent pace.

It's great to see a quality TV series making its way into mainstream America. It's so rare for something like this; I was stunned to find so many people (mainly my friends, coworkers, and family) were equally enamored with the program.",1143504000,9,3276,4.808170515097691

This extra light issue is most likely because the DVD was released not long after the show to help pay for production cost for season two. The quick DVD release makes for a far better picture quality since the  master tape of the show did not lose quality siting in a vault at Fox for years like many other classic tv shows.

  The TV DVD's of today have chapters with in each show  so you could go back in to one show 15 min. into it with a chapter number. Twenty four season one does not have this feature. In other words if you stop watching and turn the power off on your DVD player you have to remember the seen and fast forward to it.

I think the 2-4 seasons DVDs of ""24"" are not made like this. I think they are up to todays standers of extras. The acting, story and perduction on this show are still one of the best on air.

The 24 hours involved are the day of the California presidential primary. He learns of a plot to assassinate the front runner and is assigned to work the case. The plotters know their business. They kidnap his family to ease their way but they don't count on Bauer being who he is. They also don't count on the candidate being the man he is.

It's an intense and emotional roller coaster packed with adrenalin rushes and lots of action. There are characters you loathe who turn out better than expected and others you trust who turn out to be dirtbags. Nothing is predictable except that waiting for the next season is tough.

Episode synopses appear below:

12:00AM-1:00AM - The episode starts with Counter Terrorism learning of a plot against a presidential candidate. There is reason to believe that elements within the unit are involved. Agent Jack Bauer is assigned to get to the bottom of it. His methods are ruthless and to the point. They are also effective. There is an hour to get the job done. The clock is ticking but Bauer has other things on his mind as well. His daughter has sneaked out of the house and is up to teenage foolishness of her own. His estranged wife is left to deal with the situation and that makes nobody happy. As the episode ends, the situation is even more tense all around. There is corruption within the agency, the candidate is worried about a skeleton from his own closet, a 747 has been blown up and the daughter has gotten in over her head.

1:00 AM - 2:00 AM - The dirt in the Agency is worse than feared and the plot to kill the presidential candidate has escalated to a whole new level. That means more security but, because the senator has some skeletons in his own closet, he has ducked his security detail. The danger is growing. Its also growing for the wayward daughter who is in with a really bad crowd. She is in danger and so is her friend. The boys she is with have plans for using her somehow, we don't know how, but it will be bad...almost as bad as the turncoat agent.

2:00 AM - 3:00 AM - The Creeps who took Bauer's daughter have a connection with the rogue elements in the Agency. The girls learn something about how brutal life can be. So does the senator. His opposition is playing dirty and is prepared to spread lies(?) about the senator's family. The senator's attempts at damage control make him even more vulnerable. That's not good because the bad guys are out for his blood. The bad guys include some bad gals as well and they are double crossers. Since the Agency has its own problems with loyalty, Jack doesn't know who he can trust. Actually, he does...nobody.

3:00 AM - 4:00 AM - Jack's daughter has been recaptured by the urban scum who are in league with the assassins. Her friend has been left for dead but the scum are having second thoughts about making sure.  A couple of worried parents are heading in the same direction but they are stopped for a traffic violation. The distraught father makes the mistake of mouthing off to the officer and that results in their being delayed from finding the girl. Jack has a lead and gets out of headquarters just before it goes into lockdown. The guy running the lockdown is dirty but it is unclear whether he is dirty regarding the assassination plot. Jack's lead pans out but a cop is killed in the process and the suspect is clams up. Jack does learn one important thing. His daughter's disappearance and the assassination plot are linked.

4:00 AM - 5:00 AM - The dirty agency supervisor is probably just a routine corrupt official and not a part of the assassination plot. This is good because he actually lets Bauer talk to the suspect. The suspect knows about the daughter and he is up to his eyeballs in the plot. Jack's daughter has been transferred to a professional bad guy. There is a contact set up. Bauer has to spring the suspect from the jail in order to make the contact. This hacks off the local police even more. It pays off with a bit of information but not enough to reach the goal. Meanwhile, the candidate has learned some devastating things about his son which may be true...even though they come from a reporter.

5:00 AM - 6:00 AM - Jack finally meets up with his wife at the hospital. He figures that the other daughter may be the subject of an attempt to get rid of witnesses. The girl is in critical condition. Candidate Palmer turns out to be an honest, if misguided, politician. The dirt on his family is true and everyone knows about it except him. The wife is more interested in ambition than silly things like love, family and spouse. The kidnappers get serious with Jack's daughter. They get him away from the hospital and have him under surveillance. Worse, the father of the other girl is not who he seems to be and he now has mom off on a wild goose chase.

6:00 AM - 7:00 AM - The threat of hiving his daughter killed has forced Jack back to HQ. The terrorists want him to replace the ID card they are cracking the code on with a fake. They are afraid he is getting too close. They also force him to get access to the big breakfast with the candidate. His assistant gets suspicious and the only way to get out is to kidnap her. Meanwhile, the wife still has her own problems. She manages to escape the kidnapper but she calls the Agency asking for help. The Agency send some more kidnappers. The place is riddled with them. This screws up everyone's escape attempts. The candidate wants to do the right thing and come clean. He is about the only honest person in this mess but his wife's ambitions may lead him astray.

7:00 AM - 8:00 AM - The rat at CTU headquarters is finally identified. She was suckered into it with the promise that ""nobody will get hurt."" Now, the assassination is about to go down and she won't talk until she talks to a lawyer. That seems like a recipe for assassination and murder. The Secret Service has been apprised of the threat. Now they think that Bauer is the real enemy and are looking for him. Bauer is looking for a way out of a lose-lose situation. It gets uglier and uglier.

8:00 AM - 9:00 AM - The assassination plot has been foiled and Jack Bauer is in custody but nobody is exactly sure what happened. Jack's family is still threatened and so, for that matter, is the candidate. Jack knows that the only way for his family to survive is for him to escape and he is driven to desperate measures to do so. The rat at HQ is still not talking and possesses needed information but takes drastic measures to keep that information from coming out. Meanwhile the wife and daughter have to take some drastic actions themselves to plan a possible escape. Again, the candidate seems to be the most honest person around but his ambitious wife stirs up even more trouble on that front as well.

9:00 AM - 10:00 AM - The day isn't getting any better. Jack is still a fugitive and his family is still being held captive by the terrorists seeking to assassinate the senator running for president. He manages to elude the police but the mole in the agency dies before giving up any information. A new hard case is sent out to take over the Counter Terrorism Unit and cuts the feet out from under those still trying to help him. They do get their first real lead on the power setting up the hit. It looks like they find the money man and Jack is out for blood.

10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Jack has the money man. Now he has to sweat the information he needs out of him. The guys who planned and executed the kidnapping and assassination attempt have lost the trust of the ones who have hired them. The men behind the scenes have a contingency plan and say that both will be dead by the end of the day. It seems like the real bad guys made have a history with Jack from an operation in Serbia. Candidate Palmer has some connection as well. He has his own problems to deal with. His wife is making plans behind his back with his fired chief of staff. She is willing to take part in dirty deals to further her ambitions but her husband is not. When his suspect dies, Jack's only hope is to make it to a meeting with the money man's contact. That reunites Jack with the man who was posing as the father of his daughter's friend.

11:00 AM - 12:00 PM - Jack's prisoner is forced to take him to where the wife and daughter are being held and Jack finally gets reunited with them. The hard case sent to take over the CTU is busy busting the chops of Jack's friends and trying to find out where he is. She is playing agents off against each other in the hope that one of them will break. This puts Jack's whole operation at risk since he is cut off without support. Jack is forced to call his replacement to ask for help. She doesn't trust him and she is suspicious so Jack starts the rescue with his wife, daughter and one of the teen scumbags who has had a change of heart (and hormones). The candidate is trying to protect the doctor who violated his confidences. He doesn't like the guy but suspects that those with political motives will try to kill him to shut him up. The day from hell is only half over.

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM - The big escape attempt has bogged down. Jack's vehicle was destroyed and they have to make their way on foot. It's a game of cat and mouse as Bauer and his family try to avoid being captured by the assassination team while they wait for rescue to arrive. Meanwhile, Presidential candidate Palmer has his world torn down around him. Though he strives to be honest at every turn, he finds more and more corruption within his own staff and family. The puppet masters are trying to get enough leverage on him to force him to continue on with his candidacy. They want him in. The ones wanting his assassination want to prevent that just as much and a second assassin is on the way.

1:00 PM - 2:00 PM - Jack is in custody and his family is seemingly safe but things are not as they appear. Someone is still out to get them even if it is just to make sure there are no loose threads...but there may be something more to it than that. CTU is aware that there are more threats against the candidate but the new team leader is more interested in her career than anything else. She thinks that torpedoing Bauer is a smart career move. The big threat from Serbia is methodically wiping out the first team that failed and is setting up for another attempt. The candidate has been pressured into continuing the campaign but his son is finally developing a conscience and wants to come clean. Connections are starting to be made with Yugoslavia and the candidate thinks this whole affair has been orchestrated by Bauer as vengeance for a failed operation in Serbia that he had something mysterious to do with. To make matters worse, there is a mole within the campaign organization.

2:00 PM - 3:00 PM - Jack is still under a cloud and his family is being interrogated at a safe house when Senator Palmer shows up and demands to speak with him. After pulling some strings, he gets his way. He thinks Jack is part of the big plot. Very quickly though, they both come to the realization that the hit is not motivated by politics. It is revenge for an operation in Yugoslavia several years before. They come to believe that they and their families are all still in danger. They are right. There is one other person who can help, a former operative. He proves useful but he's on the hit list as well. They body count starts increasing and the Senator pulls some string to get Jack reinstated and running the investigation.

3:00 PM - 4:00 PM - The CTU team finally begins to get a few breaks. They find the identity of at least a few of the assassination team. When they warn the senator and his staff is briefed, one of them comes forward as having had contact with one of the shooters. She is willing to cooperate. She will set up one of the shooters. She better hurry because another shooter is closing in on Jack's family. The safe house is not as safe as they had hoped and mom has to take things into her own hands again...with seemingly tragic results. Just to keep the tension ratcheted up, Jack has reason to suspect there is another mole in the CTU but there is no way to be sure. It going to be even harder to figure out since his security clearance has been downgraded. The senator's son has his own vendetta and sets off on his own tangent. This is going to further confuse everything.

4:00 PM - 5:00 PM - The car crash has left Jack's wife and daughter separated and each believing the wrong thing about the other. The daughter thinks the mother has been kidnapped and the mother has amnesia and doesn't remember who she is. The daughter doesn't trust anyone except for the young punk that helped to kidnap her to begin with. This does not sit well with the punk's girlfriend.  CTU is using the candidate's staffer to try and plant a bug on one of the assassins. The nervous woman understandably has a difficult time maintaining the act. The woman scorned has more on her mind than just helping the cops. That thwarts all the plans for the setup. The daughter has problems with being ""the woman scorned"" as well. The only ray of hope is that Jack manages to set up a meeting with somebody involved in the plot but that's for next time.

5:00 PM - 6:00PM - When one of the assassins becomes a casualty, most chances of rounding up the rest of the ring are thwarted until a phone call gets them an opportunity to meet with one of the others. This will involve Jack posing as the hurt assassin and hoping that the other won't recognize him. Unfortunately, one of his back up team has a score to settle with Jack personally. The brass are keeping the information about Jack's family away from him. The daughter is now being held by a minor league bad guy and the mother still has amnesia and doesn't remember who she is. The candidate's wife is still worried more about her own ambitions than about anything else including her husband, family, truth or justice. She gets caught by her husband's sting and he decides he cannot trust her.

6:00 PM - 7:00 PM - The bad guy set up for a contact is dead but Jack does get some information to lead him to another point he thinks is critical. He just doesn't know why it's critical. He heads that way and is shepherded by his boss. He still thinks someone is dirty in the agency and the agency still hasn't told him that there has been an attempt on his wife and daughter and that they are missing. The wife is starting to come out of her amnesia and is taken to her house by an old flame. The bad guys are casing the place looking for another try. Meanwhile, the daughter has gotten herself into another bad situation when she looks up the thug who kidnapped her. Another thug then holds them both while he tries to conduct a drug deal and rip off his source. It is going to get even uglier for her. The senator finally makes his big speech and leaves everyone speechless and some crooks livid. I think I might even vote for this guy and hope his honesty is infectious. Jack makes his way to the next site but the bad guys realize he's there. He still doesn't know what, if anything, he has found.

7:00 PM - 8:00 PM - Jack finally figures out that in addition to the revenge motive, there is a political motive to the assassination attempts as well. The coordinates he finds leads to a secret prisoner and Jack is taken into custody by the defense department which runs the place. Jack convinces the warden that an attempt will be made to do something at 7:20. He learns that a secret prisoner will be transferred at that time but that nobody knows who the prisoner is. When the prisoner arrives, it turns out to be somebody Jack saw die in Serbia several years ago. He is the patriarch of the Serbians who are trying to kill him, his family and the senator. He knows they are going to make another try. The daughter has been picked up by the police who think she is a run of the mill druggie and don't believe her wild stories. The mother is being taken to CTU. The senator learns that honesty really does pay off and that his wife is even more power mad than he believed possible.

8:00 PM - 9:00 PM - The terrorists make an attempt on the secret prison and they manage to capture the place, proving along the way why one should not negotiate with terrorists; they don't keep up their end of the deal. Now, CTU must find a way to rescue them. Jack's wife is back at CTU being a nuisance because she is being given the mushroom treatment. The daughter is still rotting in jail but she manages to get some leverage by actually standing up for herself. The senator sweeps the primaries and his wife is not any more trustworthy than before but he has some new problems. One of his interns has the hots for him. At least he is standing strong and still acting as an honest a decent man. Meanwhile, back at the hellhole, the terrorists kill everyone but Jack and manage to escape. They are about to kill him as well but he has a bargaining chip. Then the daughter gets caught again.

9:00 PM - 10:00 PM - The terrorists have Jack and they have his daughter. They want them both dead but they also want one of their own back. They try to arrange a trade but the political animals at the agency figure it's better to lose Jack than to face possible embarrassment. They write him off. This hacks off some of his team members who contact the senator through back channels to see if he can put some pressure on the agency to go through with a trade. His wife has schemes of her own. She wants the White House and has her own ambitions. Since their marriage is troubled, she looks for leverage. The old harridan tries to set him up with a staffer to gain some leverage but, so far, he is still squeaky clean.

10:00 PM - 11:00 PM - The terrorists are nothing if not persistent. They have Jack's daughter again and are threatening to kill her unless Jack does a few things for them. They want him to get the senator to unlock their funds, and they want him to kill the senator. It looks like the senator is going to succumb to the setup his wife has prepared for him. He doesn't and he finds even less reason to trust his wife. He does trust Jack but Secret Service does not. Jack comes through though and saves the senator again. Keeping the terrorists in the dark though puts up a terrible obstacle: the candidate's wife. She fears that saving Jack's daughter will endanger her own political ambitions. They have more problems. There is still a mole inside the agency. It is one of the biggest surprises of the season.

11:00 PM - 12:00 AM - The terrorists not longer have Jack's daughter but he does not know that. The mole sets Jack up for death by telling him that his daughter has been killed. That puts Jack into revenge mode and the terrorists are going to be toast. That still leaves the problem of the mole. The mole has its own hostage but does not manage to escape Jack's wrath. His hardest decision is the one not to kill it. The mole should have been killed because it killed the hostage. The candidate has his own problem as well. That is his wife. Being the honest man he is, he solves the problem and the day from hell is over.",1142208000,4,19338,4.3567267683772535
1521741,5,B00005JLF2,"You are probably saying to yourself ""oh yawn, some patriotic, xenophobic terrorist propaganda TV show."" Ok, a little, but really not at all. This show is completely captivating, but you must watch it from the beginning to get the best impact. It is action and drama and totally unbelievable plot lines that you will be hanging onto every moment to see. Resist the temptation to fast forward, and just watch. The pacing is unbelievable. The acting and all the stunts are fantastic. I'm not normally a guns and violence show watcher AT ALL, but you can't let it go. What is going to happen to Kim? What about Jack? Who is the mole? You won't believe who they kill off and what twists the plot takes. You'll never guess who the terrorists really are. I'd say give it a try if you are at all inclined. Seasons 2,3,4,5 get even better and better. Truly. As long as you remain in the moment with the action and drama of the show you will get a thrill.

I sat from 2pm until 12:30am watching only some of these discs, because there are so many stories, they're very dramatic, but also fantastic and exciting!!!

This is like a real-time movie, actually. When I ended watching an episode, I just wanted the next to begin, because I wanted to know what would happen!!!

I sooooo recommend this to everybody.

1521792,4,B00005JLF2,"If you are buying this because you haven't seen the show yet, like me, then go ahead. I started watching 24 at season 4 and want to catch up on the first three seasons now. Season one was definitely good but definitely slower than season 4 and season 5 so far (writing this in February 2006).

I want to second what another person said about the DVD lacking some basic things. The episode intros (i.e ""Previously on 24"") are missing completely. This is okay if you watched the whole season in a week like I did. However, if you are going to watch it over a little time then they would be really nice. Even worse than leaving those out though is the fact that starting on the 2nd or 3rd DVD they added a crappy catchup before each episode that is exactly the same and is shown before all remaining episodes. It is really, really bad. They definitely should have just left it off.

Spoiler follows... If you haven't seen this yet then don't read below as it might give away some of the plot.

Spoiler ----------------
Unlike season 4 which has numerous twists and turns this season basically has a single terrorist plot, kill Palmer and Bauer. It simply takes them a while because Jack keeps foiling their plans. It did kind of bug me that after the ordeal that the mother and daughter went through the people from CTU couldn't keep them safe. Personally I thought it was stupid to send them to the hospital without a full, armed detail. Even when Nina thought something was suspicious she kept leaving them alone. It was just silly. And then the safe-house had so many windows and they just let them hang out by them at their leisure. Also, there were supposedly motion detectors every 10 feet around the house and yet no alarms were sounded when the bad guys came inside the house.

All of those are little things that I can excuse but one thing is still bothering me. I think they ruined the show with the last hour and the whole Nina plot twist. I just feel like she was doing too much to help Jack throughout the entire day to suddenly turn bad. She had so many opportunities to stop him throughout the day and didn't. I also think it was really stupid of Jack's wife to go looking for Nina in that back room, enter the room even though she heard her speaking in German, not to mention the fact that she knew it was German. After all that she had been through that day that was a crappy way for her to die. Especially since they had to really stretch to justify the killing: she overhears Nina speaking German, she ask Nina about the German she was speaking, the woman on the phone routes Nina through Germany, and the woman on the phone tells Nina to make sure that no one can connect her with Germany. Simply lame. I still love the show, especially after season 4. I'm hoping that since season 4 was so good that seasons 2 and 3 will also be better than season 1.
End Spooler ------------

1521796,5,B00005JLF2,"For most of us, a busy day might include a meeting, a nice dinner and a night on the town. For Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) that would be a lazy Sunday in the warm August sunshine compared to the single day that makes up the debut season of 24, one of the most daring and exciting television series I've ever seen.

Time - there's lots in a day: 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds, one spin of the earth. The attempt to make a film documenting an entire day, virtually in real time, might have worked in The Truman Show, but I'm sorry to say that my interest would have been less than enthusiastic if anyone other than Jim Carrey had been cast in the starring role. It's just that difficult to make true real-time seem exciting. But that's what 24 does. Going from midnight to midnight on Super Tuesday, the day that would-be United States presidential hopefuls find out if they're going to enter the horse race for the White House, the show's first season is conveniently made up of 24 episodes, each lasting one hour.

John Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) stands a better than good chance of becoming the first black U.S. President, but someone's set up an elaborate plot to assassinate him on the day when his pending nomination is to become official. Enter Bauer, an esteemed member of California's counter-terrorist unit, and the only person with a chance of cracking the case.

Although the time aspect of 24 could be viewed as a gimmick (it is), it's also what makes the show unique and sets the intensity of every episode. As the day carries on, the plot unravels and thickens, and the stakes are raised to near unbearable points for all the characters involved, you're left guessing what's going to happen up until the very last second. This is suspense at its best. Everything is laid out methodically, so that when surprises pop up (and they do every few minutes), they make sense. The writers are not afraid to challenge the audience's expectations, often taking the route least predictable.

With everything that's going on, there's never a shortage of action, especially in the closing seconds of every hour. This is where a lot of the twists happen, as the makers try to hook viewers to tune in again next week. This is where the real-time format shows its greatest weakness. It's strange how everyone seems to get shot in the 59th minute of an episode. This may not have been as noticeable while watching on television during its initial run, but when you watch the whole season over a short period of time on DVD, it becomes obvious that the producers worked to pique interest at the end of every hour. The spins follow a time pattern, but it's still tough to figure out which way the spin's going to go.

We live in an age of conspiracy theories and uncertain global relations. Who are we watching? Who's watching us? The first season of 24 is all about the loss of trust. Bauer, his family, his co-workers, Palmer, even the public at large see the most sacred and intimate of emotions wither away, sacrifices to the television gods, and to my delight. Anyone you play with might just be playing you. Anything can happen in an instant. That's the thrill of time. It's only predictable in the present. 24 starts out by playing with the form of time, simply by letting it run. How long can the gimmick last? Who cares? Season one ranks among the best debuts I've seen.",1139788800,5,3374,4.607321131447588

I was going to buy the package deal offered for series 1 - 4, but after calculating, it was about 28.00 dollars cheaper to by them separate and check off ship together. got all 4 for 133.00.(that is with shipping)  The set offered is 152.00 with out shipping and is not a boxed collectors set. It would be the same exact ones I received. really great deal",1139270400,6,515,4.389473684210526
1521798,5,B00005JLF2,"My brother warned me that if I started watching 24, my nightmares would change as this thriller about anti-terrorist agent Jack Bauer would get inside my psyche. My brother was right. This real-time suspense drama addresses all our terrorist fears and pits hero Jack Bauer against those pernicious forces. The series succeeds in creating fully dimensional villians and heroes. Almost Shakespearean, is the relationship between President Dave Palmer and his devilish wife Sherry.

But of course the real engine of this series is Jack Bauer played with great power by Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland makes a great rebel, always butting heads with government bureacracy and in a way the subtext of this series is the frustration we all feel when the bureacracy slows us down with its turgid self-serving functionaries.

I should warn you that once you start a season, it's impossible to stop. You'll want to watch all twenty-four episodes in as short a time as possible to capture the show's intensity. I've started with season one, and am now starting season four. Watching the episodes in quick succession is a far ""purer"" experience than watching them once a week on TV with commercials.  This is landmark television, with all the drama, production values, and character development of full-feature films.",1138320000,3,1303,5.195238095238095
1521799,4,B00005JLF2,"I think the concept of how the show works is well known by now, some five years after initially being aired.  What remains is the quality of this incredible series.  Its well written, with extrememly great care to what these characters mean.  The entirely plot around David Palmer could make for a remarkable show or film in itself, as could all of Jack Bauers.  And without dropping any grave spoilers for those still privledged to have not seen it yet, the plot twists and grows with evolutions servicing these characters wonderfully.  I cant remeber thinking so fondly of a character like Palmer in quite some time, and certainly not on TV.  He is what I think everyone could ever want and dream for in a President, and yet still as flawed and real as any other person.  Just wonderfully played by Haysbert.  Kiefers Jack has an intense passion for his family, an incredible sense of urgency and deals just as he should given the circumstances.  Fantastic performance.

I shall say that I thought that Hopper was not at his best here, and wow, his accent needs lots of work.  You are nt Count Dracula, Dennis.  There are also some tired bits of music spread throughout, hinting at a multitude of composers, but I don't know that for certain.

All in all, its the most entertaining, suspenseful show I think you can see right now, and one that will have you watching all 24 hours damn near back to back (as I think its best viewed).  When the moments work, they are as tender and touching as anything else right now and the investment in Jack and David is unrelenting.

Highly recommended!",1137628800,3,1591,4.612099644128114

When I ran out of CSI's (all three shows) I went looking for something new, so I picked up 24 Season 1. Man was I in for a surprise. I spent the next few nights up until 2 or 3 in the morning watching it. Even when I knew I should be going to sleep i could not make myself stop watching. Had someone put a gun to my head I probably would not have moved. The acting is amazing. I did not know that TV had such wonderful actors, the best being Dennis Haysbert playing David Palmer. He is the coolest character ever, you always half expect the guy to do the stupid thing and listen to the idiots around him or let something go that should be dealt with then you find out either then or later that he is no where near that stupid. The writers on this are friken geniuses; I mean who could pull this off without doing something totally cheesy.

1521843,5,B00005JLF2,"This section is for people who have NOT seen it yet:

I just finished Season 1 of 24 and I can't believe I waited this long to watch it!  Then again, I'm glad because I don't think I could endure having to watch it week to week - I just couldn't handle the wait and commercial interruptions!  Really the best way to do it is on DVD because all the cliffhangers will make you keep watching - even if you know you have more important things to do or are up way too late on a school night.

I know there have been a lot of reviews pointing out the flaws and I would have to agree that some plot points are so ridiculous that they will bother you, but do not believe for a second that they ruin the show or make it not worth watching.  Overall, the show is just fantastic - a pure rush of pulse-pounding adrenaline.  Kind of reminds me of the Amazing Race in a way - by the time you get to the end of an episode you just HAVE to watch the next one to see what happens.  This is not a show to fall asleep to - it's a show that will keep you up all night.

WARNING - SPOILERS!!!

That said, I cannot resist adding my $.02 on the things that bothered me.  This section is for people who have seen it already:

1)  It has been said before here and I will say it again - having the entire fate of a terrorist plot rest with 2 drugged out teenagers and a hippie van.  To think that they blew up a plane, got an assassin to have picture perfect facial reconstructive surgery, and infiltrated a gov't agency like CTU, yet left it up to Beavis and Butthead to handle the kidnapping is totally ridiculous.

2)  The pathetic women on this show.  Ok let's see, in a 24 hour period we had women as the victims of 3 kidnappings, a rape, amnesia, being suffocated, a female cop shot and killed when she went for the janitor instead of the gunman, and a wrist-slicing suicide (later found out to be murder).  You had the female on the plane get the ID card by whoring it up in the plane bathroom, then her lesbian lover gets shot because she wanted more money, a hysterical campaign employee who when working with the govt under heavy surveillance decides to kill a vital suspect because he LIES to her and says he LOVES her, a conniving first lady, a bright campaign staffer who is too weak to say no to her and decides to flush her career down the toilet to proposition the senator, (oh and that reminds me the senator's daughter was raped too!!) jack's wife teri is unable to find her way down from mulholland drive even though she's been up there like 3 times in one day, her overall inability with directions and inability to find a road, a car, a payphone, or knowing which way to go and which way she should obviously NOT go, oh and how about parking a car on the side of a cliff while we're at it?  This finally brings us to Nina, who before we find out is the evil heartless Yelena we think is just a ho who sleeps with everyone she works with.  WHAT UP?!  Can anyone think of a woman on this show who had ANY redeeming qualities??  Yet EVERY single ""good guy"" male character is noble, virtuous, honest and always does the right thing.  Excuse me while I go barf.

3)  This brings me to the most ridiculous of all and I can't believe it was not touched on more here.  David Palmer.  Love the actor, but COME ON.  This is a POLITICIAN, running for PRESIDENT, who is HONEST.  Do I even need to elaborate on this?  Even if it will cost him his campaign, he will always do the right thing and tell the truth.  I found the whole first story with him about the murder/accident cover up to be boring and a waste of time.  Dude.  Your daughter was *raped*.  What do you care if it was an accident or murder or what?  YOU should've been the one kicking his butt, and you should be happy to cover it up.  But you'd rather send your son to JAIL than just let it go because some scumbag who raped your daughter died afterwards?  PUH-LEASE.  That is even more ridiculous than Dennis Hopper's accent.  Which brings me to...

4)  Dennis Hopper's Hippie/Mexican/German/Wanna Be Serbo-Croation accent.  Let me just suggest right now that the only way to get through those last few episodes is with a lot of whiskey.  Could someone please tell me the point of bringing in Dennis Hopper for the role to begin with?  Why couldn't they just find *anyone* who could pull off the accent?  Sheer torture.  In fact, he should have used his accent as torture/leverage with Jack and he probably would've gotten everything he wanted.",1136505600,5,4494,4.247641509433962
1521844,2,B00005JLF2,"Poorly acted. Plot lines, while I realize that this is tv, are so far fetched it is ridiculous. So many events that happen are so silly, my wife and I did virtually nothing but yell at the tv asking how that ""event"" makes any sense...

OK, so you have these sophisticated terrorists trying to arrange these two assassinations, but their whole plot hinges on the abduction of a teenager by two dim-witted dope heads. How in the world these two are able to drive around in that van and never get pulled over by the cops is astounding.

All that being said, we watched all the episodes...why I don't really know, but we did.

1521846,4,B00005JLF2,"The idea of a season of 24 episodes each of which cover one hour in real time was very creative, but would not have been successful without an amazing story to go with it.  Season 1 has such a story where a counter-terrorism agent has to deal with an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate, one or more moles in his agency, and his family in danger.  What a day!

I am glad I did not watch this when it originally aired or the week between episodes would have been painful to endure.  Even with the series in a box, I suggest viewing this in two sittings (there's a non-cliff-hanger break between episodes 13 and 14).",1134259200,3,628,4.387931034482759
1521847,1,B00005JLF2,"I missed this on telly, initial (UK) broadsheet reviews being indifferent, then suddenly announcing  after a couple of weeks that 24 was the most urgent, unmissable televisual event in a generation. So I bought the DVDs to make sure I had a clear view of the ""unmissable"" event.

Unmissable my arse.

24 is poorly plotted, poorly scripted and dreadfully acted. The plot is so bad that you'd have to be a paranoid conspiracy theorist of a Branch Davidian calibre, or perhaps just a bit dim, to buy into it. It isn't the fact that there are plot holes - though there are many and they are big, deep and wide - but that the plot is so ridiculously contrived and improbable (not to mention pea-brained) that such whopping plot holes could even be possible in the first place.

Let's say you want to assassinate an aspiring presidential candidate on the day of a primary (so he's not even a presidential candiate yet!). Do you, in the space of twenty-four hours (a) infiltrate the CIA's counter-terrorism unit in order to ensure a specific agent is assigned to the candidate, kidnap that agent's daughter (using an extremely precarious, long-winded, and low-probability of sucess plot which relies heavily on two stoner teenagers and a van), tail and then kidnap his wife, send the agent on a wild goose chase, hire a trained assassin to steal the idenity of a photographer then escape from and blow up (all in mid-air) a jet airliner, hack the CCTV system of a hospital, all the while anticipating and dealing with every possible unexpected contingency and ... (sorry, but that's as far as I've got, so you'll have to use your imagination for the remaining eighteen spisodes) or (b) engage a professional marksman to shoot him next time he's at a public outdoor appearance?

You wouldn't be a million miles out if you guessed that option (b) doesn't feature in any of the episodes I watched. The list could really go on and on, and I have only made it a quarter of the way through.

In despair, I resign my viewership of this ridiculous series.

1521848,4,B00005JLF2,"When this series first landed on tv i seemed a little interested but with all the crap on tv nowadays its harder to find a decent show anymore.  After the X-files was cancelled/ended i thought it would be the last decent thing i would watch. I never bothered to try watching ""24"" until episode 6 or 7.  The concept of the show obviously is 24 hrs is the season while each hour is in real-time (1hr per episode or 45min with commericals).  The only issue i see with this show is the drama.  If you were to spend 1 hr to watch 1 episode a day it would be fine but if you had never seen it b4 you want to watch it every second you have.  There are many people who really don't have the attention span for that.

The producers of the show & everyone who is involved in the series has done ""alot"" of work cuz this show is not something that can be done overnight, they had to have planned the entire season out before putting it on video.  I have noticed quite alot of plotholes in all (or most) the seasons where some things are taking longer then it should but yet they went with it. It might have been to make the show less boring to mix drama (ie: the president's issues) with the action & suspense but sometimes it looks like it gets in the way of the main plot.  Either way i guess most people who like this show doesnt mind it.

As for the DVD portion of this show its all good except for the programming.  They definatly needed to put chapters into each episodes instead of putting it into one big long episode.  Granted that TV-DVD's were not exceptinally popular & i guess Fox or whoever manufactured this DVD package thought it would just be faster to throw each episode on one chapter.  But now since they are popular they should have changed it by now.  I recently got this season on DVD & im suprised they never changed anything on it.  Also another thing iv'e noticed too is there is no recap on this dvd set (they figured it would give the viewer more time to watch the set) but there are dvd sets (other shows) that can give you the option if you want a recap or not.

There are alot of flaws in both the series & this DVD collection but its a great concept & a great series.  And hopefully season 5 (& possibly more) will be a great contribute to the rest of the show.  Im also glad there are better shows out there (Supernatural, Prison Break, House) & i think ""24"" was a great help into stringing people back to better television.",1133913600,,2445,4.19017094017094
1521849,5,B00005JLF2,"Kiefer Sutherland, Hollywood's greatest actor (in my opinion) has never gotten a role this incredible. 24 is a show about a counter terrorist office that tries to stop the attempts of attacks within a whole 24 hours.

  JACK BAUER (played by Kiefer Sutherland) is head of the Los Angeles branch of CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit). Jack lives with his wife, TERI BAUER (played by Leslie Hope), and their teenage daughter, KIM BAUER (played by the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert). Jack and Teri had been separated for six months, whereas Jack has finally moved back in to work out his marriage with Teri. It is now 12:00am, midnight, where Kim has snuck out of the house to meet with her friend, JANET YORK, where the meet with two guys named, DAN and RICK. But this meeting goes awry, for the girls find they have been kidnapped. As Jack heads out to find Kim, he is stopped when he gets a call from his office, telling him to come into work, for an assination attempt has been made on a presidential candidate.

  That presidential candidate is SEN. DAVID PALMER (played by Dennis Haysbert). He is in L.A. with his lovely wife, SHERRY PALMER (played by Penny Johnson Jerald) and their two kids, KEITH and NICOLE, where David will be entering the eleventh and final primary, wh ere he had already won the first ten.

  Jack arrives at CTU and is given a heads up by NINA MYERS (played by Sarah Clarke). Nina's position at CTU is one step below Jack's sort of making her the sub-boss to the company. Nina's assistant is TONY ALMEIDA (played by Carlos Bernard). With the help of GEORGE MASON (played by Xander Berkeley), Jack, Nina, Tony, and the rest of CTU begin tracking down the evidence leading them to the terrorists who want David Palmer dead. In the midst of their findings, Nina and Tony discover a traitor within the office. The traitor is killed as Jack arrives at the Presidential breakfast, where he prevents the assination, saving Palmer's life.

Throughtout the course of the day, Teri searches desperately for Kim. Kim has been kidnapped by a man named IRA GAINES. He has Kim kept in an isolated barn, where Rick, every now and then, checks on her, for he cares for Kim, as she does for him. Teri is kidnapped and thrown into the barn with Kim, until Nina and Tony help Jack find them. Jack helps them escape, where they are taken to a safehouse, where Nina asks Teri and Kim of how this has happened, until Teri realizes that, while she and Jack were serparated for six months, Jack and Nina had an affair. But Teri, through some rough thoughts, sucks it up. The safe house is hit by the three assassins, who planned the threat. One of them is a man named ALEXIS DRAZIN, who keeps in contact, with his brother, ANDRE. Kim wanders off, searching for Teri, who has amnesia. Kim heads to Rick's house, but trouble sparks as Dan's brother, Frank tries to make a drug deal, until everybody, including Kim, is arrested.

  Teri gets her memory back, as Tony saves her from one of the assassins. He brings her into CTU. Palmer and Jack, together, realize that Andre and Alexis are doing this for, Jack had killed their father, two years earlier, while Jack was on a mission in Belgrade and Kosovo, which makes Jack a second target. Palmer is a traget, for he authorized the mission. Jack finds out at an underground prison facility that their new prisoner is VICTOR DRAZEN (Dennis Hopper), the man Jack supposedly killed.

  Throughout the day, David tries to comeforth with a confession that Sherry has hidden: the death of a man, who had raped David's daughter, Nicole. His son, Keith, had accidentally killed the rapist, forcing Sherry to finally tell David that she covered it up, but David's forthcoming of the incident, only helps him win more votes for his honesty. But Sherry tries everything this can to take that away, for she only wants to be come the first lady. More lies and more defiancies from Sherry lead David into filing for divorce, after their 25-year marriage.

  At this time, CTU discovers that a second traitor is within their midst. As it would turn out, Nina turns out to be the traitor. She is helping the Drazen's in this whole ordeal, where they tell her to Jack that Kim was killed, leading him into violently killing Alexis, Andre, and Victor. He finds that Kim was never killed and is on her way to CTU, after the police find out of her innocence. Jack and Kim hug passionately, but they find that Nina has killed Teri in the CTU office.

This show is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride and the best way to start off with this show is this brilliant first season. Some heartbreaking moments, yes, but this first season is outstanding. Kiefer Sutherland has always been a talented actor, but this time, he has really proved that he is the best actor out there. This role was made for Kiefer and for Kiefer only! This is one hell of a first season.

1521902,5,B00005JLF2,"OK, so I don't watch much TV.  But I rent a few and I'd heard about this show and thought it sounded kinda silly.  But I decided to put Disk 1 of Season 1 on my Netflix list.

On a recent business trip I took the disk along (45 minute TV episodes are a good length when travelling).  Needless to say, once I started the disk late one night I watched all four episodes back to back!  If I'd had more, I would have watched more despite a severe lack of sleep.  I immediately bought the Season One set, and within a week had watched the whole show.

I knew one of the key spoliers, but even with that the show was grippingly intense.  Very simple story, a few clumsy plot devices, and a few outright manipulations.  But terrific acting by Sutherland, a pretty good supporting cast, and a relentless pacing that will leave you breatheless and worn out.  Try to avoid reading descriprtions of subsequent seasons or this season's key surprises will be spoiled.",1133136000,,954,4.4
1521903,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is the best television show to ever hit the world. The show is based on the life of Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland), a government CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) agent. The show is real time, a season is based on one full 24 hour day. There are 24 episodes, each episode lasting an hour, example: 12:00 A.M.-1:00 A.M.

  This show contains drama, action, shocks and twists. At the beginning of the season, Jack Bauer is told that an there is an assassination attempt on David Palmer, a presidential candidate, that will take place within 24 hours. While Jack is trying to figure out who is behind the attacks, his wife and daughter are kidnapped by the terrorists responsible for the assassination attempt. By threatening to kill his family, the terrorists want Jack to assassinate David Palmer and take the blame of the killing. What will Jack Bauer do?: Save his family and sacrifice David Palmer, or sacrifice his family in order to save the future President of the United States? This is only the first 12 hours of the season!!!

  I highly recommend buying the first, second, third, and fourth season on DVD. In my opinion, the first season is the best. Kiefer Sutherland is sensational playing Jack Bauer, this is his best performance. No one else can play Jack Bauer, because Kiefer Sutherland is JACK BAUER. Here is my list:

  1.) Season 1

  2.) Season 4

  3.) Season 2

  4.) Season 3",1132012800,2,1394,4.690082644628099
1521904,5,B00005JLF2,"In my opinion 24 is the best show on TV by an absolute mile and the first season was the best of all.  Of course by now the concept is no longer original now there have been 4 series (though it still maintains it's excellent standards), but at the time this was an innovative formula.  There are so many twists and turns in the plot and almost every episode ends on a cliffhanger, though at times you have to suspend your disbelief it is amazing TV.  Obviously Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic as Jack Bauer, a role he has completely made his own, but all the actors involved are great, Carlos Bernard as a hostile towards Jack, Tony Almeida, is a great charachter who develops over the future series.  Sarah Clarke is Superb as Nina Myers as is Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer, both these characters were central to the plot in the first series, whereas in future series they were perhaps unessential to the story.

It truly is as great as everyone says, do believe the hype.  I actually missed the first series when it was on TV, however after watching half of the second series i went out and purchased it on DVD, and i was not dissapointed.  Though im sure most people know it by now, the ending is superb and very unexpected, i won't ruin it here in case you haven't seen it, but it is incredible.  Anyone who hasn't watched 24 before should buy this series first and the rest in order, as they are all superb, it will be money well spent.",1130803200,4,1439,4.3632958801498125
1521905,5,B00005JLF2,"'24' Season One is pure genius, a rollercoaster of a thrill ride that always keeps you on the edge of your seat. Its intricately woven story lines are always watchable, the acting is very strong, and the set design is A-grade.

Here are the reasons why '24' Season One is a must-see:

1) The time element of the story (every episode covers one hour of one full day) is essential to the main plot involving Jack and his family. The subplots, especially the Senator David Palmer one, get added tension from the time constraints, and it's wonderful to watch!

2) The acting is top notch. Keifer Sutherland is remarkable as Jack Bauer, a CTU agent who must defeat terrorists and their plot  to assasinate a presidential candidate. Senator David Palmer is played by Dennis Haysbert, who does an amazing job at playing a senator who must protect his family while also protecting himself. Penny Johnson Jerald gives a fantastic performance as his wife Sherry. Sarah Clarke, who plays Jack's loyal friend Nina Myers, does a terrific job at revealing the complexities of her character. Elisha Cuthbert (Jack's daughter Kim) handles her scenes very well, and Leslie Hope (Jack's wife Teri) gives a commanding presence as a mother who will do anything to make sure her daughter is safe.

3) The production values are very good, providing action sequences with realism you don't often get with tv thrillers.

4) Everything on the show (minus the Amnesia plot, which could be argued as realistic) has a ring of truth to it, especially with the show's ending. The ending of the show is honest, shocking, and unflinching. It is emotionally driven and makes the season that much more realistic and great.

'24' Season One is a masterful achievement and is unlike anything you've ever seen. It's the best season of television you could own on DVD. And once you've seen all 24 episodes of this fine season, you will forgive the set's lack of special features. It really is that good.",1130025600,2,1965,4.795857988165681

1)  Driving all over Los Angeles never takes more that 10 minutes

2)  Highly trained terrorists, who seem to be able to infiltrate and murder at will, cannot seem to capture and hold Jack's wife and daughter.

3)  Said terrorists cannot hit Jack or family with high powered rifle with a scope (open shot), yet Jack can instantly identify where sniper is, use a piece of scrap metal to reflect sunlight (in the woods no less) directly in snipers eyes, then shoot him with a pistol

4)  The whole scene in the hospital in the first few episodes where Jack's daughter's friend is taken to - how did anyone in the world know that the girl would end up there?  Yet, the hopsital is completely infiltrated, bugged, camera ready, and there is a car in the basement waiting for Jack.

5)  Cell phones work everywhere, and never run out of charge

6)  Terrorists speak english in front of Jack and daughter.

7)  Jack's daughter escapes terrorists with pot of coffee.

8)  Jack's office looks like something out of GQ magazine - please someone, show me a government office that looks like a nightclub?

9)  Pretty handy that they always seem to have someone on tape from hidden cameras.

10)  While the terrorists seem so high tech and so capable of pulling off some amazing counter intelligence, and seem to have an unbeleivably large amount of money and people resources, they seem incapable of some of the most basic skills when it comes to anything to do with Jack and his family.

1521955,3,B00005JLF2,"From the claustrophobic, labyrinthine sets to the slow-building and sinister incidental music 24 - season one - looks and feels like a cross between a real-time strategy game and a first-person shooter. It also has the addictive element of the gaming experience and as with most games, the feeling that it wasn't really worth our time.

24 is not an enriching viewing experience in the way other series such as 'The Sopranos' or 'The Wire' are. There is very little character development, leaving the viewer pretty much devoid of any sympathy with the fate of the people in the story.

Like it's video game cousin, at times, the never-ending plot twists and turns to the point where we, the viewers, are not as concerned as we should be about what happens next to the characters.

24 does, however, have its moments. The chief reason why there are not more of these moments is the concept behind the show - namely, all the action takes place in the space of 24 hours. The idea has been lauded from all sides yet it is this very thing which prevents the story from really taking off. The characters are so boxed in by this time constraint that it's practically impossible for a satisfying portrayal of the emotional ups and downs induced by the ever-changing circumstances they find themselves in.

In the scene where the daughter is involved in a third kidnapping (in 24 hours, don't forget) one of the FBI (or CTU to be precise) characters exclaims 'I don't believe this!' I couldn't help thinking how long overdue such a comment was.",1125273600,6,1535,4.695167286245353
1521956,4,B00005JLF2,"I missed the entire first season of ""24"" and didn't become a regular viewer of the show until midway through Sesaon 2.  It took me a while to get used to the show.  While I enjoyed the ""real-time"" format, I questioned how, in such a large metropolitan area as Los Angeles, every location ever shown could be just ten minutes from CTU Headquarters -- including a bomb site in the Mojave Desert that took 45 minutes to reach by helicopter the previous week.

I didn't get to watch Season 1 until shortly after the conclusion of the most recent season on TV.  Therefore, I came into the first year with a lot of mystery taken away: I knew Jack's wife, billed as a regular, was not someone in whom I should invest a whole lot of emotional attachment.  Additionally, of the four CTU regulars introduced in the show's first hour, I'd only heard of three... so obviously someone wasn't going to live long past sunrise.

But even watching ""24"" in a way the producers did not intend in the autumn of 2001 -- knowing how certain cliffhangers would end; already familiar with the ""real-time"" format -- I still found the first season to be edge-of-your-seat viewing.  Even when I had the ability to watch the show over six weeks, not nine months, I still felt cliffhanger anxiety whenever the closing credits flashed on screen.  Some could say the show even abused the format, with the repeat drubbings it gave its female co-stars (Kim Bauer on every disc; her friend Janet on the first two discs; and her mother on the final four), but even those plot twists earn comedy value.  The amnesia in this season rivals the mountain lion and the baby, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.

As in later seasons, the producers are able to overcome a soft parade of B-grade actors and their wooden line readings -- there is a lot of Deep Hurting in this set -- with several rewarding extended big-name guest appearances.  I was shocked to see Lou Diamond Phillips turn up late in the day, for example.  Dennis Hopper, who seems to have based his Serbian bad-guy accent on Mike Myers' Doctor Evil, more than atoned for the pain he put me through in ""Apocalypse Now"".  Also great to see Paul Schulze introducing his sometimes sinister suit from Division, a million miles from his equally rewarding recurring role on ""The Sopranos"".

And could this show possibly work without Kiefer Sutherland?  It took me a while to realize just how much he means to the show -- hard to take seriously, at first, a man who is forced to shout ""Drop your weapons!"" every other episode.  However, he maintains such a high level of adrenaline week in and week out that he more than overcomes the occasional plot hole or weird left turn.  Dennis Haysbert does the same in Season 1, not yet the ineffectual Democrat president who got his news in later years from Fox News Channel.

I do wish the producers had put more material onto this set, although I'm aware that subsequent seasons get the more deluxe treatment they deserve.  However, the twists, turns and surprise guest stars in Season 1 should carry the show through repeat viewings, which is the whole point of the DVD format in the first place.",1124496000,3,3167,4.573451327433628

This is a revolutionary concept , especially for this day and age, where so much is predictable and controlled-as in corporation/government controlled.

One might also posit the notion that the ""far-fetched"" conspiracies in this first season are not so far-fetched when one considers there's a war being fought based on complete misrepresentation of the facts.

1522012,4,B00005JLF2,"I perhaps have the strangest history with the FOX television series ""24."" This past fourth season was, in fact, the first whole season of ""24"" I caught from beginning to end. I barely caught anything from Season 1, caught the latter-half of Season 2, and did the same for Season 3. How weird is that? Well, this summer, after watching the wildly uneven but generally satisfying fourth season of this terrifically compelling action drama series, I'm trying to make amends for missing the complete first three seasons of ""24.""

So I write this review not as a rabid fanatic of everything ""24,"" but as merely an interested viewer of the show. And, after catching up with this strong first season, I can see why this was considered such a powerful show when it first blasted onto the television scene in Fall 2001.

The big gimmick of ""24,"" of course, is its real-time format; every season takes place over a span of 24 hours in a full day of the life of CTU agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) as he tries to save lives and prevent danger. Forget about the real-time concept; it's pretty loosely applied here anyway. The attraction of the show, I think, is that it expands the boundaries of the TV thriller. Not only does it embrace the serial concept---every episode follows from what happened before, and if you miss one, you may miss something crucial---but it uses the concept to add extra breadth to the season's convoluted thriller plot. Subplots abound in Season 1 involving, for instance, the personal affairs  of Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) as he discovers the truth about something that occurred seven years ago involving his son Keith (Vicellous Shannon). But, most importantly, the real-time format allows creator Robert Cochran and his team of writers to develop the various characters so that, as the events of this long day unfold, we become emotionally involved in what happens to these people. Not many action movies today even bother to emphasize characters and emotions in quite the way ""24"" does.

This first season of ""24"" is far from perfect. Its second half is much more uneven than its near-perfect first half; the whole ""instant amnesia"" thing in the season's latter half was stupid enough that it almost made me fear that the season would never recover (which it did, handsomely). For a few episodes in the second half, the David Palmer subplots actually seem more interesting than the main terrorist-threat storyline. And the editorial reviewer is right; the final twist doesn't entirely make sense. In short, this season is not the most confidently-made and paced. Still, even as the momentum and tension threatened to dissipate by the season's halfway mark, the show proved to be intelligently written and well acted on a mostly consistent basis, and this was enough to compel me to watch from beginning to end.

I give Kiefer Sutherland all the credit in the world for creating a characterization of Jack Bauer that never loses credibility for a second. His deep desperation as he tries to save both his family and the life of Senator Palmer is vividly conveyed; so is the love he feels for his family (even if his job at CTU means he isn't always there for them). Sutherland is the anchor that grounds this series' myriad plot twists in firm reality; Jack Bauer is a hero, but he's always a human one, and that's partly why he is such a compelling central figure in ""24.""

And then there is Dennis Haysbert, who is almost perfectly cast as Senator David Palmer. Palmer is arguably a less credible figure than Bauer is: Palmer seems to be a noble political fantasy brought to life, since Palmer is a man who never sacrifices his principles in the name of politics, and who is always willing to tell the absolute truth to the American public. (In this show, he doesn't get burned by the public even when he admits to a behind-the-scenes scandal.) The show's conception of Palmer may have seemed insufferably idealistic in other hands, and yet Haysbert somehow makes Palmer a charismatic, authoritative, and above all believable figure (even if what happens to him and his campaign isn't always entirely believable).

Thus, Season 1 of ""24"": an uneven but mostly strong inaugural season that promises more good things to come in the next three seasons. Recommended.",1120348800,4,4302,4.844897959183673
1522013,5,B00005JLF2,"In 2001 the Fox network decided it would take the dramatic television series to the next level with the introduction of one of the most exciting, action packed series' to be created, ""24"".  ""24"" utilizes a unique format for telling it's stories, instead of having individual episodes tell an individual story that would probably have some small impact on the season's outcome, ""24"" chooses to tell one story that occurs in a single day, all season long and have each individual episode count for one hour out of that day.  Using what is now known as the real-time format, which means that each episode is exactly one hour of time that has passed in the day.  Most shows seasons span many days, months, maybe even a year, but ""24"" chose to be bold and stand out from the rest of the competition.  A move that could have been costly in regards to ratings and success, but proved to be the shows most endearing quality and virtually ensures it high ratings each week as people tune in to see what will happen next.

The basic backbone of ""24"" is the lead character, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), a federal agent working at CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) for Los Angeles.  Bauer, along with his fellow CTU agents are responsible for stopping threats to the security of L.A. and sometimes the country.  The first season, or Day One as it is commonly referred to, introduces everyone to Jack's disfunctional family, Jack and his wife had recently been separated but are trying to work it out and his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) is constantly getting into some form of trouble as she is in the full swing of her rebellious teenage years.  As Jack is trying to piece back together the puzzle he calls life, a threat is received on one of the presidential candidates that happens to be visiting Los Angeles to drum up voters support.  Now this isn't just any presidential candidate, this is the first black candidate (Dennis Haysbert) to really have a chance at the White House, so an assassination attempt on his life could be catastrophic to the country's race relations.  At the same time this threat is received, Jack's daughter Kim, sneaks out of the house to hang out with a friend and two boys she doesn't know all that well.  All of this occurs in just the first hour of day one, and propels the season forward with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end of episode 24.

With incredible acting and storytelling that leaves you wanting more at the end of every episode, it's no wonder that ""24"" is one of the best dramas on television.  The only drawback to the show is also it's strongest element which is the real-time format, it's excellent if you catch every episode, but if you miss one or two you pretty much have no clue as to what is going on.  However, there is hope for those who may have missed an episode and the solution is exactly what I'm reviewing now, the season box set.  So, whether you are a fan of the show or saw a few episodes and became intrigued but had no clue what had transpired before or after the point you came on board, this season box set is a definite must have.  Highly recommended.",1120262400,,3153,4.534391534391534
1522014,5,B00005JLF2,"After the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) learns the identity to a ""domestic hate group's"" target in an assassination attempt, Senator David Palmer, CTU Agent Jack Bauer is called in for a mission briefing right after discovering his teenage daughter, Kim, snuck out of the house. As Jack's wife, Teri, starts searching for anything that may lead her to Kim, CTU is briefed on the Palmer hit. In a one on one discussion, Jack learns ""that there may be an element inside the agency supporting the hit on Palmer."" Jack tries to follow through on his orders while trying to do what he can in the search for his daughter. Meanwhile, as Senator Palmer works on his presidential campaign, he receives a disturbing phone call from the media, all the while not knowing his life is on the line. While Jack continues working with these words in mind; ""don't trust anybody, not even your own people,"" CTU learns of an airliner that exploded over the desert; another piece in trying to prevent the hit on Senator David Palmer.

This is a story that deals with the government, politics, a damaged family on the mend, and one in which names have to be paid attention to and remembered. The creators of the show also love to play with the audience leading them in various directions throughout the storyline. To top it off, Sean Callery provides an original score that literally helps the tell the story, and the constant display of the ""real-time"" clock ticking away does its part as well. The pilot is an astounding piece of work by itself; the acting, editing, camera shots, and the story are all one in the same; amazing. In the pilot, as part of character development, Kiefer Sutherland delivers a great line that is one of my favorite quotes of all time; ""You think they were the bad guys? 'Cause they weren't, they weren't bad guys. They were just like you and me. Except they compromised; once.""",1119571200,,1897,4.679640718562874

I like Keifer Sutherland.  He's a great actor and I enjoy his performance in this show.  Solid performances from all of the actors in fact.  But there are just too many ""you have to be kidding me"" moments.  The premise is great, and I give them credit for trying something different instead of churning out more clones of Law and Order or X Files.

The show can be fun at times, but after watching the 16th episode, and literally laughing out loud seeing what becomes of Jack's wife and daughter by the end of it (I don't want to spoil it in case you actually make it this far into the series so you can laugh out loud too!), I absolve myself of watching any furthur episodes.  The suspension of disbelief and cliches is just too much, it's like watching a terrible thriller.

Do yourself a favor and rent this before you even think about buying it.  Myself, I'm stuck with an unfinished season 1 (because I can't bring myself to watch another episode, yes it's that bad.) and an unopened season two and three that will be going up on ebay when I have time this weekend.

Do yourself a favor and check out HBO's ""The Wire"" or FOX's ""Firefly"" (masterfully done, I can't say enough good things about Firefly or The Wire)

The fine performances and original idea save this from a 1-star rating.",1118361600,19,1408,4.45703125
1522049,3,B00005JLF2,"For those of you not familiar with ""24,"" the most-important thing for you to know is that Federal Agent Jack Bauer (Sutherland) is a combination of Dirty Harry and James Bond: he'll do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if it means breaking all of the rules. To quote Homer Simpson: ""It means he gets results, you stupid Chief!"" There is no way anyone in real life would get away with half of the outrageous antics Bauer manages to pull off in just one hour. But that's what makes it so much fun to watch.

""24"" is a terrific serial adventure. By no means is the writing devoid of plot holes, but as long as you suspend any resemblance of reality, it is incredibly fun to watch, as well as addictive. It's funny to me to think that, whereas ""24"" is an entire season of shows that follows one day and has been a success, the show ""Murder One"" followed one murder case for a season's worth of shows and was a ratings nightmare. Regardless, if you're anything like me and enjoy shows that don't follow the usual ""wrap it up in 44 minutes"" formula, you'll enjoy the first season of ""24.""

I didn't start watching ""24"" until the most recent 4th season, which hooked me from the start. I decided to revisit the previous seasons. Having just completed this first season, I enjoyed it overall, but preferred the 4th. The storyline of having to protect Presidential Candidate Palmer was a good one, but was lost for the most part because of Bauer and his family. Granted, I haven't yet seen either seasons 2 or 3, but what I loved about 4 was the complete focus of Bauer on his assignment. Overall, I think the 4th, 24-hour mission was better because of the complete lack of any ridiculous dangers involving his daughter, Kim.

If this is where you journey with ""24"" begins, then you'll have some good surprises in store. Just watch out for Dennis Hopper's Eastern European accent. It has got to be one of the worst ever captured on film.",1118275200,,1938,4.453521126760563
1522050,4,B00005JLF2,"At first glance, the premise of 24 seems like a gimmick - the events of the show take place in ""real time"", meaning that if it takes 15 minutes to drive from point A to point B, 15 minutes will pass in the show.  Therefore, the show requires lots of overlapping stories to fill the gaps that such travels bring.  In this case, thanks to the writing teams and the directors, the gimmick works and the show succeeds very well.  Without giving away anything that doesn't happen in the first few episodes, the main plot involves federal anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer investigating a tipoff that says there will be an attempt on a presidential candidate's life.  The candidate, David Palmer, is African American and a current senator - are either important?  The subplots (which are all ultimately interlinked) include a coverup in the Palmer family about a suspicious death, the kidnapping of Jack's daughter, and the murder of one of Jack's bosses.  To complicate things, just before he dies, the boss tells Jack of traitors in his unit - but he doesn't know who they are.

The plot weaves in and out of these stories, with a cliffhanger in at least one of them to whet the viewer's appetite for the next show.  The shows are action packed - obviously Fox believed in the show right away, because it looks like the effects/stunts budget for one episode would cover the entire season of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI.""  There are many surprises - everything is in play, and any given character could be killed at any given time (except Jack, of course, who has to last at least until the last show).  Just when you think you know what's going on, the writers take a turn - they are unexpected (and unpredictable), but not unfair (they aren't just played for shock value).

There are advantages and disadvantages to owning this series on DVD.  On the up side, there's no commercials or other distractions to take you out of the story - it's critical for a show like this that the viewer remains immersed in the show.  On the down side, there are places where the gimmick breaks down, and these are especially obvious when watching shows in close succession.  For example, at the end of one early episode, a girl is hit by a car.  At the beginning of the next episode (supposedly 5 minutes later), she is already in the ambulance and on her way to the hospital.  45 minutes after that she has had surgery, suffered momentary heart failure, and woken up to talk to the doctors.  Likewise, some characters apparently vanish - for example, the dark-haired girl who negotiates with Gaines in the first couple of episodes.  We see them drive off together in one episode, and then never see her again.  Similarly, the boss's revelations before he's murdered are ignored and/or contradicted by later events.  Finally, all the events seem to take place within a 15-minute drive of the unit's HQ (even in rush-hour LA traffic!)  None of these problems would be remembered by the average audience member watching the series over the course of several months, but are jarring when watched on DVD over a few weeks.

These are minor quibbles (as is the fact that the DVD contains no extras worthy of the name).  The show is generally solid, with lots of great action and suspense.",1117929600,,3257,4.655594405594406
1522051,5,B00005JLF2,"I just started getting into 24 not too long ago since it comes paired with the other show I watched on Mondays in the 2004-05 season FEAR FACTOR. Anyway Season 1 of 24 is by far the best season simply because of Jack Bauer. Kiefer Sutherland does his best to desperately try to save the US from a terrorist attack and also saves his daugther Kim and later tries to save his wife Teri but dies at the end of the season. I personally like the fact that the episodes go by the 24 hour period with each episode being 12-1 AM, 1-2 AM, 2-3 AM etc. 24 is by far the best show on TV and also by far the next best thing to the CSI franchise!",1117670400,,632,3.9453125

Jack's daughter, Kimberly (who isn't real smart) sneaks out of the house with a friend to go meet two guys which, I might point out, they have NEVER met.  Isn't that retarded?  These guys basically have 'kidnappers' printed on their shirts.  Anyway,  Jack is called into CTU when a threat to the African-American, President running, Senator David Palmer is detected.  The story erupts into details too hard to entail in a reveiw.  The next 24 episodes will have you on the edge of your seat as a story of betrayal, conspiracies, and a father willing to go as far as is necessary to keep his family safe unfolds.

I turned my whole family into believers of Jack Bauer and we all watch this show together.  For the price you are getting 24 episodes spread out over 6 discs.  Thats pretty good considering many television shows have only 12-15 episodes.  Also if you enjoy this show check out seasons two and three, which are also available on DVD.

I was curious to read what others thought about this series...particularly this first season, so I came here when I was part-way into the season, and started reading. Bad mistake!

While MOST members posted acceptable reviews, there were WAY too many that posted information about things that happened in the season, without stating that there were ""SPOILERS AHEAD"". Needless to say, the rest of the season had few surprises in store for me.

One writer suggests using the fast forward button on your remote to speed the series along. I suggest you instead just ""fast forward"" past ALL of these reviews and instead, sit down and enjoy the series on your own. You won't be disappointed.

In fact...you'll be surprised by every new twist thrown at you, instead of watching and thinking ""Gee, I wonder when that part that I read about is going to happen?""

If you're still reading, suffice it to say that there is a LOT of entertainment for the money in this set of DVDs. I can't wait to see Season 2...especially the episode where what's-his-name gets killed.  Just kidding. I know NOTHING about season 2 and I'm going to keep it that way until I'm done watching it.

1522089,3,B00005JLF2,"There is just enough drama and action in this series to keep you popping in additional discs and staying up far too late watching things unfold.  Unfortunately, the flaws are so laughable that it's hard to take the experience very seriously.  If you can stand Dennis Hopper sounding like a Mexican trying a Russian accent in order to sound Serbian, look past ""my winning 3-pointer over DePaul"" from a guy who would have been in college far prior to the 3 point rule being adopted, and if you can get yourself into a marathon 18 hours of viewing, this can be fun.

Some suggestions, however:  the series is too flawed to be taken seriously, so have plenty of beer available to drink every time Jack uses his telephone.  Not many will make it to the 3rd hour.  Especially if you throw back a shot when he says, ""hey, it's me.""  A special bonus should be available everytime a character addresses the Senator-to-be-President with ""with all due respect.""

After hour 14 or so, we were just looking for the big finish, which was fairly disappointing.  Obviously Jack is going to go ape in some big finale gun fight, but if you want real action, nothing tops ""Unforgiven"" or ""Open Range.""

1522091,5,B00005JLF2,"First airing in November 2001, 24 quickly established itself as one of the best television series around and solidified itself as a cult classic icon. Utilizing a novel premise, each season of 24 comprises a single day in lives of its characters, with each of the 24 episodes representing a one-hour time segment of that day. Kiefer Sutherland stars in the imminent role of Jack Bauer, a government agent periodically faced with enormous challenges within a single day. Each season is reminiscent of a fast-paced Hollywood action thriller, but it's only a busy day in the life of the heroic Bauer...

Season 1 unfolds in Los Angeles during the California presidential primary as CIA agent Jack Bauer and his colleagues uncover a murderous plot to assassinate front-running candidate David Palmer. With only 24 hours to uncover the identity of the determined killer, Jack must race against the clock if he has any hope of thwarting the plot. Meanwhile, Jack is distracted by his crumbling marriage and the disappearance of his rebellious teenage daughter. The clock is ticking... Can Jack save the man who may become president? And can he do so while keeping his family intact?

The 24 (Season 1) DVD features a number of breathtaking episodes including the season premiere in which the groundwork for the series and the season is laid. Jack plays chess with his daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) before receiving a call from Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke), his colleague at the Los Angeles Counter Terrorism Unit, telling him to report in for an emergency meeting. Meanwhile, Jack and his wife Teri (Leslie Hope) realize that Kim snuck out of the house during the phone call... When Jack arrives at headquarters, he's informed of a plot to murder Senator David Palmer, the first serious African-American presidential candidate... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include (#8) in which Nina and Tony discover the identity of the mole who is working for Gaines, and (#23) in which terrorists threaten to kill Kim unless Jack complies with their wishes...

1522092,5,B00005JLF2,"I first saw 24 when it premiered about four years ago, I think, I actually was so unimpressed and bored that I left before the first half hour was done. What brought me back to the show was my brother, who had watched it from the beggining and one night had it on when I had nothing better to do. I was amazed and pissed at myself for giving up on it so easilly, the show is simply amazing and the writers are talented people to pull togethter a show as complicated as that.

Now as some of the reviews have pointed out there are some very stupid little twists in there that are just wrong, amnesia, and by now you all should know the impossible Nina one. But those are only small problems and don't put down the show too much.

Onto performances. Sutherland is simply amazing in this show and shows a much better performance then any of his previous works. This guy convinces us that he would be willing to sacrifice anything for his family, he is also a very cool kick butt character.

Elisha Kuthburt as the daughter is nothing too speacial, but she works great as eye candy, and every once in a while she will surprise you. Her character is one that will piss you off somtimes because she can act like a spoiled brat, but she always finds a way to make up for it.

The rest of the characters are all pretty good. Just know that the first 12 hours of the season are the best, but don't let that stop you from watching the rest of the show, the last episode is suspensefull enough to drive you insance.

1522093,5,B00005JLF2,"Let me start by saying I hate TV. The only show I've ever watched with dedicated steadiness is the X-Files. I got ""24"" on recommendation of a few friends, and the moment I sat down to watch it my world changed forever. This show is brilliant. Nothing short off.

Needless to say, after reading some reviews on this site I find myself shocked. I've never been this upset about any other review on Amazon before. I can understand how it may not be for some people. I even understand how some people may have issues with certain characters (Bauer's no-nonsense ways or Palmer's righteousness). But I cannot FATHOM how anyone can call it unrealistic, unbelievable or, worse yet, tedious. TEDIOUS??? I haven't slept or eaten normally in the past few days because all I can think of is getting home and watching another episode. Just one more... Just one more... I can't tear myself away from it. No show has ever been able to do that to me.

I am shocked that people find it unbelievable events like these can occur within 24 hours. All I can say to them is, you need to get out more! I've stayed up longer than that without sleep or food and barely a bathroom break, one of those times being in 1993 in a godforsaken Russian train station when a bomb threat was called in. You better believe things like that CAN happen, and they DO. Do you really believe that just because it's not on the 10 o'clock news, it isn't happening? You think you know EVERYTHING that's going on within your government? You don't think there's a Jack Bauer out there somewhere running around without sleep or food to save all our asses even though we have no clue he even EXISTS? Please, don't be naive.

I'm shocked that people are attacking the ""liberal agenda"" of this show - which is absurd. Did you even know that FOX is run by one of the most conservative people in the country? What bleeping liberal agenda? Palmer being black? If there was really a guy like Palmer out there, and if he really did run for president, I would vote for him in a heartbeat!

Everything in this show is top notch. Writing, directing, acting. The cast is stellar, and everyone - EVERYONE - is good match for Kiefer, he does not stand out at all but rather shines ALONG with a number of other stellar performances. A few annoyances (like the insistence that Jack's family always gets into trouble) do not spoil the rest of the show at all.

Sorry, but anyone who says things like ""it insults my intelligence"" are giving themselves too much credit. It doesn't sound like you've got much intelligence to spare if you give this little gem 1 star.",1112054400,5,2600,4.5

And perhaps that is the highest praise, after all. Once started, it is very difficult to tear away from the calamity which is one day in the life of Agent Jack Bauer. Minute by minute, the drama unfolds - a Presidential contender nearly assasinated, daughter kidnapped, wife decived and kidnapped, and again, and again! Jack Bauer beaten, confused, betrayed, and betrayed again!

The proposal is quite attractive: each episode (one hour, minus commercials time=roughly 45 minutes) equates to one hour of real time in the story. At the end of all 24 episodes, you're left with a day's worth of action (and how much action it is), revolving the life of Jack Bauer, a Federal agent who is fighting to save the life of a Senator who is in danger, while he keeps his own family safe.

To kiddnap the annoying girl Kim, also a substantian part of the bad guy's plan, he hires two stupid and intoxicatd teenage boys! How clever!!

Okay, here is the DVD set, lets take a chance. I popped in the first DVD already knowing that this about an elite anti-terrorist unit in LA and that the show plays in real time.

I promised myself I would watch no more than one a day. Sorry no way. You absolutely cannot just watch one. I watched all 4 on the first disk in one evening. This is the equivalent of a book that you ""can't put down.""

First there is the main plot, an assination plot against a presidential candidate. Then there are the numerous subplots all woven together with almost perfect synchronicity.

Each episode is unbelievably action packed and contains at least one major surprise. Few full length motions pictures contain as much excitement as as many thrills as one 40-odd minute episode of 24. You'll find yourself counting the minutes, as ""I'll be there in 15 minutes."" then look at the clock and see that his arival will be at the end of the episode, then practically holding your breath at the interim scenes.

The real time element is so different and innovative I wasn't sure that it would make all the much difference from a normally plotted show or movie but Oh my does it ever add an edge to it that accounts for its ""I can't only watch one"" addictability.

I was very impressed with that element even if it not exactly perfect. I have a hard timebelieving that Jack could drive across LA in 7 minutes even after midnight, but who cares. it flows and it will keep you glued to the set. You won't want to miss a second.

Ther story will rope you in and if you watch episode #1 you can almost walk away from it and say I'll watch #2 tomorrow. Once you get into #2 your only hope will be to force yourself to limit it to one disk ( 4 episodes ) in one sitting.

Production values are superb for a TV series. Acting and writing are all top notch. I can find little to fault the show. The DVD is fine, good even. It has a few minor faults but nothing serious. Picture and sound quality are quite acceptable for a TV series and they presented it in wide format - kudos to the producer for that.

Another reviewer commented on the set up of the disks, no chapter breaks, no previews and the like. The previews are not big deal to me since they'll only make it harder to walk away from a disk. I don't even mind the chapter breaks since it keeps the player on the time line. I have no problem with that at all.

I would have liked to have to option of showing the ""previously on 24"" slice. But the lack of it os no reason to reject owning this set.

The set is a must for fans, but if you've ever heard of the show and are curious, the price is right on the set.",1108080000,5,2772,4.1722846441947565

1522211,3,B00005JLF2,"I bought this DVD series hoping to encounter something as original as the X-files, or at least as suspenseful as Alias. However, what I received is a stripped down ""drama"" that is driven more by its own premise [24 hours IN REAL TIME!] than any sensible plot line.

After the first few episodes aroused my curiosity,I found the experience of watching subsequent episodes annoying. The business about who on the inside is ""dirty"" was played around and around from every angle.  Then, implausible events are scripted so more instant drama can be injected.  Like leaving the captureded ""dirty"" one unattended with a cell phone.  What?  And the inclusion of the seriously overwrought Palmer, Democratic presidential candidate, and his hyper-absorbtion in his son's possible wrongdoing -- takes up way, way too much of the story line.  In fact, if you start stripping away the filler in this series, you end up with something that could be told in 2 hours as opposed to 24.

This is the rare series that was probably more palatable with commercial interruptions in between so you could have a respite from the unrelenting hype-fear-tension-OH NO WHAT'S NEXT rigid atmosphere of this very unoriginal story. Further there is not a hint of irony, self-reflection or humanity with respect to any of the characters in ""active"" mode other than the Sutherland character and possibly his daughter.

I finally had to stop watching it because I began to dread wasting 45 minutes per episode.  I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters -- there is little or no character development here. On the other hand, there is some good acting.  Kiefer Sutherland does a tremendous job within the narrow confines of his part.

1522255,5,B00005JLF2,"The idea behind 24 was one of the best in the history of television -- that of having a single season take place in real time over the course of 24 hours, each episode representing one hour of the ordeal -- but that would have been meaningless had the show not been done so superbly well.  24 was probably the most innovative show in what in retrospect has to be one of the great seasons in the history of television.  Today, with television tremendously harmed by the ubiquitous reality shows, scripted TV--especially scripted TV with long story arcs--has suffered a tremendous decline.  But in the 2001-2002 television season we had such stellar shows as BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, 24, ANGEL, FARSCAPE, ALIAS, THE SOPRANOS, THE WEST WING, and DARK ANGEL all showing at once.  Contrast that to the fall 2004 season, where I have been tempted to watch only two shows:  the last half of the 2004 season of DEAD LIKE ME and the stellar new series LOST, created by ALIAS creator J. J. Abrams.

24 was great when it came out, but it is much better to watch it on DVD.  There is something inherently unsettling about a story that is supposed to take place in 24 hours, but which gradually unfolds on television over the course of nine months.  Ideally one would watch all twenty-four episodes straight through (I'm sure someone, somewhere has done that), but doing so over the course of several evenings is a vast improvement over the original.  Indeed, I think that the widespread availability of television shows on DVD has done more to enhance the appreciation for quality TV and for the enjoyment of its strengths (namely, narrative, something that television does vastly better than the movies, for the simple reason that it has narrative space that movies, with their two hour limit, will always suffer from).  To use an imperfect metaphor, movies are short stories; television at its best (as in BUFFY or 24) can be a novel.  Being able to watch the show without commercials also does a great deal to improve the experience.  I am very near the position that commercials are not merely a necessary evil, but merely evil.  But that is a different debate (scan my other reviews for that hobby horse).

The cast is good but inconsistent.  I'm not sure quite what happened, but some of the actors are absolutely perfect for the show, others are not quite up to their level.  First and foremost, you have to recognize the brilliance of the two main performers, Kiefer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert.  Sutherland in particular was a revelation.  We had seen him in a host of shows and movies over the years, and while often a strong presences, especially when playing heavies (my first memory of him was as one of the punk older kids in STAND BY ME), nothing had every indicated that he could take an entire series on his shoulders and make it work.  He is so superb as Jack Bauer that it is simply impossible to imagine anyone else playing the character.  Dennis Haysbert as Sen. David Palmer was so good in his role as to be shocking.  To be honest, when I first saw him, he was one of these actors who seems vaguely familiar, but when you check his resume you can remember having been in a host of shows and films.  For instance, he played the voodoo-using Pedro Cerrano in the MAJOR LEAGUE films (I seem to remember a scene where guys on the team are trying to find a chicken to sacrifice in order to bless his bats).  At the same time he was doing the first season of 24 he was also filming the exceptionally fine film FAR FROM HEAVEN, in which he was very memorable.  Sutherland and Haysbert give the show its backbone, and they jointly give it a strength it might not otherwise have possessed.  There are a host of other strong performances as well, but I've been impressed in talking with a number of friends at how unimpressive some are by some of the other performers.  I'm still not certain how I feel about Sarah Clarke as Nina.  In part, this is not entirely her fault.  Unlike the other performers, she constantly has to play two roles; her actual character, and the role that her character is playing.  If you rewatch a lot of episodes, it is clear that the directors cheat a bit by deflecting suspicion from her character.  Her true nature is hidden a bit too well, clearly so that there would be a big shock in the final episode (though there is, of course, a hint in the opening voiceovers for most of the episodes), but I'm not convinced that they played fair with her in Season One.  I'm also not too thrilled with Elisa Cuthbert as Jack's daughter Kim.  I am not maintaining that these people were necessarily bad, merely that I'm not sure they did as good a job of casting with them as they might have.  Luckily Sutherland and Haysbert, the two who actually need to be outstanding, actually are outstanding.  I should also note that Penny Johnson, whom I had primarily known previously from STAR TREK:  DEEP SPACE NINE, is appropriately reprehensible as Palmer's power-obsessed wife.  Dennis Hopper does his usual turn as a bad guy, though I have to say that at this point I find him a bit overused in such roles.  He is a great actor, but I would rather see him do other things.

There are some minor criticisms that one could make.  The way that Kim keeps getting into trouble over and over and over strains credulity.  The fact that no one seems to be suffering from severe sleep deprivation seems a bit improbable.  The way they use the satellites near the beginning of the show to track Jack Bauer's path makes you wonder why they don't do the same thing on innumerable occasions later in the season is troubling.  But all in all this are trivial complaints.  All in all, this is a riveting season of television with at least two superb performances, a lot of tension, and a lot of thrills.  One can only hope that this kind of television, and not the seemingly endless reality shows, is the future of the medium.",1099785600,7,5935,4.558490566037736

For those who don't know, 24 follows CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) in a format where each episode represents an hour of real time action (the ""clock"" keeps counting while the commercials are on).  After 3 seasons, the first is still the best.

In the first season, Jack Bauer has recently reconciled with his estranged wife and daughter, but their family reunion is put on hold when Bauer is called in to work one night, only to get caught up in an assassination plot against an African American Senator running for the U.S. Presidency.

While some of the events that occur stretch the limits of the imagination (when you think about it, an impossibly amount of things occur in the 24 hour period), the twists, turns, revelations, and action more than make up for it.

WHATZ GOOD

Action

It's not like a movie but for a low budget TV show, the action and sets were decent, asOverall B-

Suspense

They managed to keep the show suspenseful. As the story unfolded almost all the main characters except Bauer and the Senator and Bauer's family seemed to be hiding something, in cahoots with the bad guys or out on their own agenda. Overall B+

Da Story pros

The story was good in some places and weak in others. Being a TV show, each ending segment was seasoned with a teaser to entice you to return next week. The problems I had with the story will be discussed later. Overall it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Overall C+

WHATZ BAD

Cast

I can't say I really liked anyone in the cast and I actually disliked several actors. It wasn't their acting, I just couldn't warm up to them.

The actor that I liked best was Dennis Haysbert (Senator Palmer), he did a reasonably good job but I didn't like his wife who is a pushy hag. I realize I wasn't supposed to like her but I didn't like her before it was obvious she was a hag. I also thought the son Curt, was miscast.

Another actor who I liked was CTU's third in command Tony Alameda (Carlos Bernard)who did a good job of alternating between being helpful and looking suspicious. Bauer's second in command Nina Myers (Sarah Clark)never gained my interest. She looked too much like a Sunday School teacher.

I also didn't like the casting of Jack Bauer's wife and daughter. They were OK but not great.

As for Jack Bauer himself, hey I like Kiefer Sutherland alright, he's made some good movies but I had difficulty placing him as a big tough former special forces/swat team macho type. Overall D

Acting and Directing

Generally the acting was acceptable but because of the enormous length of the story there obviously was some dull places and the acting and directing slipped in these areas. Haysbert and Sutherland did the best acting. Most of the rest were situational so the acting was more passive. There were numerous other actors involved through the course of these twenty-four episodes who gave performances of fair to good. Overall C

Da Story cons

From a story stand point I think the writers tried to cram too much into their self imposed 24 hours. For instance Kimberly along with her friend gets kidnapped, then escapes, then gets caught, then meets up with her captured mom, rescued by Jack, sent to a safe house, almost killed, escapes again, then gets arrested, gets captured again and more all in twenty-four hours.

How about this, at approx. 8 am it appears Jack has gone rogue. Within two hours a temporary Director is appointed in his place. Then another and before four oclock a third temporary Director is on the job. I find it incongruous that Jack's boss could have even appointed a single replacement in that timeframe let alone implementing three such changes in eight hours. Where were these people hanging out at the corner coffee shop? . Overall F+

Other annoying things

Of course this is because it was a TV show but I really got tired of hearing Sutherland doing his this is the longest day of my life monologue. CTU, have you heard of it? Me either. Stands for Counter Terrorism Unit. Maybe they weren't allowed to use a real agency but if they were I would have preferred it.

So What Do I Think?

After the first two four show discs of six total, 24 had me. It is a grabber and I would have given it five stars. With the next two discs I began to see cracks in the facade. These things are more noticeable when you watch eight episodes at a weekly sitting instead of one. After a while it seemed like we were rehashing old material. Like the travails of Kimberly, in, out, in, out, in, out, etc.

In the last eight hours we got to see head bad guy, played by Dennis Hooper, whose hands Kimberly was of course and he picked things up a little but the ending fell flat.

CONCLUSION

I know a lot of people raved about this show but then again a lot of people rave about Clive Cusslers silly books. What's the connection, nothing unless silliness is a connection.

Like I have intimated, this series would fly a lot better as a TV show than as a DVD mini serial movie. But since it was released that way and that's the way I saw it, that's the way I have to review it. After all we're not reviewing TV shows. In summary, it was exciting but the excitement dragged on too long and was fraught with redundancy. The acting and directing were average and the story was inconsistent. Last, too much happened in their twenty-four hour period. More than could realistically have happened in my world.",1093046400,2,5554,4.570564516129032
1522319,3,B00005JLF2,"WARNING: Possible Spoilers.

The first 5 episodes were great. The drama and suspense kept me glued to the screen. Unfortunately things started to get a little silly midway through the series. A lot of time is spent with Jack Bauer's wife and daughter being kidnapped, then escaping, then kidnapped again, then escaping, etc.

The last episode seems to break continuity with everything that happened before. If you watch the previous episodes, you will know what I mean. One character, who turns bad out of the blue with no warning and no consistency with the plot ruined the show for me.",1092268800,15,587,4.86

It is easily the most vile and manipulative piece of nonsense ever seen on television. Every contrived cliff-hanger and televised death is an indictment on the stupidity that this programme stands for. Kiefer Sutherland cuts a swathe through the populace in a shocking and cynical performance that leaves me rooting for anyone trying to kill him! 24 isn't about drama, it's about manipulating a dull-witted audience into watching the dribblings of unimaginative, unintelligent and excessively greedy ""producers"" (including the vile Sutherland).",1092268800,21,694,5.556603773584905
1522321,5,B00005JLF2,"I'm here to set the record straight on past and future seasons of 24; no one here understands the life of Jack Bauer. In the fall of 2001, 24 aired with a pilot that had been receiving rave reviews from critics, months before it was shown on television. It had been a teaser of what was to come and what fans would later expect from the amazing drama. The show is the biggest thrill rides on television and is easily one of the next cult hits.

SEASON ONE: On the day of the California Presidential Primary (Super Tuesday), the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) is informed of an assassination threat against Presidential Candidate; Senator David Palmer, there are agents who are supporting the hit. Minutes after discovering that his daughter is missing and his wife goes in search of her, Agent Jack Bauer is called into CTU to lead the investigation in order to save the senator's life. Little does Jack know, that in the next twenty-four hours; his wife and daughter will be taken hostage by the assassins and two of the most important people from his past and present will be involved.

This season was backed up with a powerful all-star cast, amazing writers, and a perfect score. The story line had the right number of twists and blows the viewer away. There were a few falters within the show dealing with the daughter and mother who kept making dumb but reasonable mistakes. The pilot and the finale left the viewer asking for more. It's clear why the show was nominated for eleven golden globes. If it had been made into a film, with all of its violence, gore, and drug content, it would have been given a reasonable R rating.

SEASON TWO: A retired and grieving Jack Bauer is called back into active duty by the President of the United States in order to aide CTU in stopping the detonation of a terrorist nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. Knowing what to expect, Jack asks for the guarded transportation of his daughter outside of the blast radius. Only the bombing of CTU throws everyone and everything into a twenty-four hour hell, revealing returning threats from everyone's past.

In this season, not only does Kiefer Sutherland return as Jack Bauer, but he also assumes the role of executive producer. This seemed like a big mistake for this was the worst season of all, anyone who says otherwise is drunk or on drugs. There was no big stars, no twenty-four hour references, no drug dealings, and not even a new score to go along. And sadly, Elisha Cuthbert returns as the dumb and stupid Kim Bauer who keeps making the most dumbest and stupidest unneeded mistakes. This character should have been written out of the show and would be believable with the show's real-time format. The idea of a rouge nuclear bomb was a good one, but the show takes forever to get into important dealings of the bomb and is abandoned a little over halfway through the season. Smaller plots which should have been covered in the season premiere, is covered in the first five slow and mostly dull episodes of the season. The show should have started with episode six and ended with episode thirteen, and is beyond me why it was nominated for any golden globes. As a show, it was still one of the best out there, but sucked as part of the 24 series.

SEASON THREE: After dropping off a contaminated body with a deadly virus, a drug dealer demands CTU's release of his brother from prison or will release the virus in Los Angeles that will result in death of the infected within twenty-four hours. Involvement includes returning rising threats from everyone's past.

An all-star cast returns, along with heavy drug content, and an all new score to back up the amazing season. Once again Kim Bauer returns dumb as ever with a boyfriend who is a field agent only to complicate things. It was cool to make her a CTU employee, but once again, she makes unneeded mistakes and should have been written out of the show. The story line is perfect and returns with amazing twists and turns showing that the writers have redeemed themselves. The season is amazing and has redeemed itself and is worthy to be called 24, it still is not better than season one, but just as good.

SEASON FOUR: All that can be said is; the show returns in January along with its real-time format.

Kiefer Sutherland will return as the notorious Jack Bauer, other returning characters are unknown. With any luck Kim Bauer will be written out of the show forever. (That's probably asking too much though isn't it?) The writers don't understand that fans and viewers tune in for Jack Bauer, no one else matters. Nina and Sherry would have made perfect villains for future seasons, but one after another was too much. Besides, I keep waiting for a season to be about the assassin Mandy. Here's another idea pitch for the writers, a film dealing with the tragedies of Operation Nightfall. And for a future season, how about seeing Jack carry out mission that is suppose to last and hour but goes horribly wrong and lasts twenty-four hours? Bauer is the reason why twenty-four exists, and why it's done so well.

Be it;

- Tranquilize and blackmail a district director

- Cut off a suspect's thumb

- Beat up a fellow agent to avoid questioning

- Break a suspect out of jail

- Take his second in command hostage and shoot her

- Deliver a weapon to an assassin

- Be detained by secret service, escape, and become a fugitive

- Take a waitress hostage

- Detain a mother's son to gain information

- Take a machine tool businessman hostage

- Sneak into assassins' layer

- Assume the identity of an assassin

- Be captured by a secret government prison

- Be taken hostage by a terrorist lord

- Deliver a terrorist bomb

- Shoot a witness dead, cut off his head, and carry it in a duffel bag

- Aide in a terrorist bombing

- Be taken hostage again by terrorist

- Deliver a witness to a rouge military soldier

- Cut a computer chip out of a man's shoulder

- Be captured and tortured by terrorists

- Have a heart attack during a stand-off with terrorists

- Shoot heroin

- Once again become a fugitive from his government

- Knock out and tie up his partner

- Be involved in a game of Russian Roulette

- Break a drug dealer out of prison

- Be captured by drug dealers

- Plan and head a secret government sting operation

- Make out with a terrorist

- Detain a terrorist's daughter and threaten to expose her to a deadly virus

- Cut his partner's hand off

- And finally break down emotionally

1522322,1,B00005JLF2,"To say i feel like my intelligence was insulted would be the greatest understatement possible. This was a great (COPIED) idea (a drama occurring in real time) that went wrecklessly awry. Sutherlands talents were abused by terrible editing, directing, and a convoluted story line that read more like the never ending 3rd world soap opera. I rented the entire DVD series, and skipped about every other disk in order to keep my sanity.  It wasn't difficult to determine who the traitor was within 30 minutes of the first installment.  This series portrays the intelligence community like the 3 stooges, and the criminals like the masterminds (Do we really need more of that?) In addition, if Jack Bauer's daughter was truly that stupid, for God's sake, let the bad guys keep her.  Dennis Hopper turned in a strong performance, possibly being the single saving grace of the entire catastrophe.  The 'Senator' was the only character who drew any respect from me at all. Before emotionally investing in the characters of '24' try watching ""Nick of Time"" (Starring Johnny Depp). Nick of Time was released in 1995 and is eerily similar...hmmmm *scratches chin* Well, anyway, if 'Nick of Time' gets you all excited, then by all means '24' may be the kind of movie for you.",1089158400,28,1263,4.88785046728972

My wife didn't really want to watch it either, but she finally gave it a chance.  She was an instant addict as well!
The show is very well done.  Instead of just one story about an antiterrorist agent, it has many that all interlink.  It is packed with action and suspense that will keep you guessing till

I watched the second season of ""24"" before I watched the first season.  I enjoyed the second season but disliked the twist of the story about half way through.  Season one gives the usual--suspense, drama, action--but I believe the story to be more plausible and cohesive than the second season.  While season one is more cohesive, I do believe season 2 is more exciting, thrilling.
Overall recommendation:  Highly recommended for lovers of action, adventure, spy, or thriller genres.  The second requirement is a A LOT of time--at about 20 hours per season, one needs some serious time to watch these.  A WARNING: ""24"" is very addicting.",1088467200,3,886,4.745098039215686

""24"" sets the course of the day for our hero, Jack Bauer, and for a long and riotous 24 hours. The first episode begins with the beginning of Jack's day and each episodes continues with the next hour till Jack's day is concluded.
This is definitely an ambitious TV series. But, let me tell you, each episode leaves you hanging. To watch this on DVD is much better then waiting a week in between episodes. I spent one whole day watching them, fighting sleep and hunger. I thought I was crazy until I heard other people's ideas on the series. And, I realized I wasn't the only one. Unfortunately, for me, I work nights so I can't see the TV series during it's time slot. But, thankfully, the DVDs are available.
There are so many twist and turns that Jack's 24 hours become your twenty-four hours.
Seriously, this is some of the most amazing television I have ever seen. You will love this! And, not to give away the ending, it's fantastic! You will not believe it.

In its first season, the aboveboard objective never seemed out of focus. Terrorism in the hands of script-writers planning its every breaking maneuver to oust the Presidency of the United States. Rigid and thought provoking that lasted for a good twenty-four hour marathon.
Kiefer Sutherland's protagonist, ""Jack Bauer"" brought the demeanor of John McClane to a whole new generation. The spirit that is somehow incisive and diverting will never fail with an audience. Sutherland's ability to take Bauer and sculpt him into
the ordinary man doing remarkable wonders exhibits strength rarely seen in televison or film.
Outside of Sutherland's persona, this show was brilliantly cast and directed. Its substantial portrayal of its characters made it intensly realistic and firmly believable. Its fast paced directing style was unlike anything before or since. The blastering of gorilla camera angles pounded on the structure that captivated its audience under complete control.
""24"" dvd box set of season one is an amazing joy ride of entertainment. Also included is an alternate ending to the season finale and a brief promo of the complete season.

If you plan to watch one episode per day, it won't work out. I bet you will keep playing the next one, and then the next one until your eyes & body get tired, or you need a biological break.

1522412,3,B00005JLF2,"24 - Season One evoked mixed feelings.
As entertainment, the first half of the season is an innovative roller coster thriller, but the second half falls apart and overstretches the viewer's willingness to suspend disbelief.
As a moral message it just scares me. Jack Bauer will do ""anything to protect my family"". He breaks the law, he jeopardizes the lives of friends, colleagues, and strangers. We cheer him on because hey, it's OK to break the law if it's for a Greater Cause. Who can argue against that? 50 years ago, serial action heroes, e.g. Zorro, broke the law but usually when they were in a corrupt country or region with self-serving officials. Today, action heroes break the law because they are impatient with the system, or because the system doesn't meet their selfish needs. Do we cheer them on for the same reason?

1522413,4,B00005JLF2,"Being the typical television cynic, I read the advance reviews of 24 and seemed intrigued by the premise of one 24 hour period shown in real time, but decided there was no way Fox would keep it all year.  I didn't want to waste my time starting a show that would never have a conclusion.  I was wrong.
I never watched season one on TV, but I became hooked on season two.  Wanting to know the back-story of all the characters' pasts, I bought this DVD set.  Watching this season and knowing going in what happens to some of the characters (I won't spoil the plot twists they way our friends at Amazon have done) can sometimes be bad, but I will say that I watched Nina's actions with an eye I wouldn't have if I had not seen season two first.
I had the opportunity to watch this DVD set in large gulps, three to four episodes at a time - I was in Germany on business and with no English TV to watch, the DVD sets I brought gave me something to watch on my laptop.  Watching the show this way is very satisfying.  There's no waiting for next week to see how things turn out...just click on the next episode.
I was never a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but after watching his range of range of emotions dealing with all that is going on to him as a professional with a job to do, as a father of a teenager, and as a husband trying to repair a damaged marriage, I'm impressed.  He really makes you feel his emotions. You get the feeling you know Jack and want to see him make it out of this in one piece.
Another reviewer mentioned this show is the story of three families, The Bauers, the Palmers, and the Drazens.  I agree completely and will not rehash their thoughts, but I would like to add another family, the one at CTU.  These are folks who have obviously worked together for years and we get to see what happens when they are thrown a curveball (Once again, I will not spoil any surprises).  How they interact with each other and react to outsiders is at least as interesting to see as the other families.
I gave this DVD set only four stars because of the lack of extras and the fact that each episode is one long track; there are no chapters like other TV series that I have bought.  You have to scan through to find the spot in the episode you are looking for.  A minor item for sure, but enough to drop this set from five star perfection.  It is still a fine production.
I spent quite a few nights staying up late watching ""just one more episode"" because this show kept me on the edge of my seat.  This production shows proves that there still are new ideas for television.  It is definitely worth the money, and your time will be well spent.",1084060800,6,2651,4.201183431952662

The plot has a twist a minute and there are some completely unexpected surprises throughout.  All of the characters are believable including his Val-Gal daughter.  Season One feeds nicely into Season Two, but you will have to watch it for yourself.  It will be time well spent.",1083888000,3,551,4.396039603960396
1522415,3,B00005JLF2,"Okay, let me begin by saying I love this series and I'm confident you will too. However, there are some faults with both this DVD package and the overall storyline of the first season. This, however, will not keep you from enjoying what is essentially a 24 hour movie packaged as a weekly television show.
Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Bauer, a federal agent for the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles. Around midnight, Jack is called into work where he meets up with fellow agents Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke), and Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard), among others. Jack soon learns that one of his own people might be working against him in a plot to assassinate presidential hopeful David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). As if Jack's troubles aren't enough, wife Terri (Leslie Hope) calls with news that dutiful daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) has snuck out with a friend and is missing. Jack's day only gets worse from here.
24 is presented in a real-time format. Each episode represents one hour in Jack Bauer's struggle to protect Senator Palmer and his own family. Each hour is complete with surprising twists, and first-rate acting. You'll be stunned more than once.
There are a few problems with the first season that lower the rating of this set. These problems are understandable however. Initially, it looked like the show might be cancelled in the middle of the first season's run, which forced the producers to conclude some story aspects early. Then the show was picked up for a full season, and they were forced to regroup and keep the story going for more episodes. This lead to some lame twists in the middle of season one, though I won't reveal them. Of course, if you've already read the Amazon review, at least one of them has been spoiled for you (note to Amazon, great job with that by the way!). However, said lame twist bothers me a lot less than the season's ending twist, which will leave you saying, ""huh?"" It doesn't make complete sense. Fortunately, you can come up with explanations that make the twist work. It just takes a little stretch of the imagination since the writers never bother explaining it themselves.
24 is very much about stretching the imagination, however. For a series like this to work, you have to let some things slide. I mean, sure it takes Jack three to five minutes to drive to just about anywhere in L.A., but would we really want to see Jack stuck in traffic for five hours? I personally would not enjoy that.
This particular episode compilation is also short on special features. And I mean immensely short! There is one alternate ending and I believe that might be it. So one star off for the far-fetched ending, and one star off for the subpar DVD set. The episodes themselves will mostly wow you. That's a promise.",1083456000,12,2766,4.716942148760331
1522416,5,B00005JLF2,"Don't watch this series on tv. It's only worth on dvd as you coudn't expect for a week to see what happens next.
 This extra long movie - series has it all:
Action, great scenario, good character development, saspens, conspiracy, everything and it doesn't lack in perfection but only in minor points ( has to do with scenario coherence which you won't understand unless you know what to look for).
There is no chance that you will get tired of the series as I saw it in a few days and I really didn't have that much free time.
The cast is great (Sutherland needs to be congratulated by someone near him) and everybody is perfect in its role except Jack Bower's wife whom I didn't like that much (They should put a prettier chick!!!) -Really she sucks and gave it on my nerves-
This series is too much for the tv as never before have I seen something that match 24. I don't know about the 2nd season and what it's story is all about but the 1st was really something else.",1082937600,3,970,4.300546448087432
1522417,4,B00005JLF2,"24 represents some of the best story telling and acting that has ever been on television.  But that does not mean that it's without serious faults.  The most dominant of which is the grotesque liberal writing, especially in Season 2.  The most obvious problem with the writing is the utter lack of concern to writing stories that are polarizing.  You will either love or hate the story agenda.
What we have here are writers that are pushing a liberal notion of saving the world that one will either choose to believe or find offensive.",1082332800,,535,4.659574468085107
1522418,4,B00005JLF2,"Make no mistake about 24: it's groundbreaking television, it's Hollywood-level quality, and it's darn addictive. It deserves most of the accolades it gets.
It's a bit unfortunate, however, that is started as a 13 episode series and got expanded to 24 at that point, because it affects the tightness of the overall story. Throughout episodes 1-13, thee series is just perfect. Yeah, there are cliches, and there's an awful lot of things happening in such a short period of time, but it's so unbelieveably well-plotted and TENSE that you can't stop watching.
Then the series hits episode 13, and it feels like it was just dragged on for the rest of the show. The stories stop making sense (you certainly heard about the amnesia angle...) and the events become less and less believeable.
As the series approach the 24 episodes mark, things seriously fall apart. Plot twists stop even trying to make sense, and are thrown out there for pure shock value without consideration for the damage they cause the story.
Regardless of this, the concept of the show, the acting and the original 13 hours are so awesome, it makes you overlook the flaws of what follows. Make yourself a favor, and rent or buy this series if you have not already. It's very, very rare that we get such quality television outside of HBO, and 24 heralds a time when even Hollywood cannot approach the depth and excellence of what is put out there on network television.",1081641600,3,1434,4.763052208835341
1522419,5,B00005JLF2,"This show is revolutionary in its format and in the topics it covers. There has never been a show like this before and there will never be a show like this again. 24 is the tale of Jack Bower dealing with the most insane day of his entire life. It is also the tale of David Palmer, the first black with a ""real chance at the White House"". Their destinies are intertwined; a past association will forever haunt their future. At first Jack seems like your typical good guy, but as the show progresses you see that he is no straight shooter. He is an accomplished liar and spy. Jack is no conventional hero. Everyone in this show has dirt in their past, secrets that they do not want uncovered. Nothing is quite what it seems. David Palmer looks to be a sure bet for the next president of the United States. His chances are sabotaged by a past cover-up. He is also a target for assassination. Bower is given the job of preventing that assassination, but personal family problems hinder him from doing his job. Jack is a complex, contradictory person. On one hand he is a killer and a spy. He has great instincts and nobody, I mean NOBODY, thinks faster on their feet then him. On the other hand he is a loving father, and like a typical parent has no idea what his kid is up to. So despite the fact that he is Mr. Cool on the job, he is just another fool when it comes to his daughter. His daughter is Kim, and she has inherited her father's guts and brains, as well as his disregard for authority. She is brave but foolish and naive. However, as the show progresses she matures into a young woman, she starts of the day a headstrong girl, but finishes it a seasoned woman. Jack's wife Terri is the opposite of Jack in many ways, but she balances Jack out with her lighter nature. However, in certain fundamental ways Terri and Kim do not really know Jack, they only now what Jack chooses to show them. Jack is a killer, he knows how to torture people, etc. He is a good guy, but he is no knight in shining armor. David Palmer also has his own family issues, his wife is a scheming power mad hag, one of his top political advisors is crooked, etc. Jack is hot on the trail of the assassins but fails to understand the personal nature of the grudge against Palmer, and his connection to it. In a sense there is no ""hero"" on this show although there are certainly a fair share of villains. However, most of the villains even have sympathetic moments, Mandy's grief for her partner, etc. I like the character Rick a lot, he is a realistic portrayal of a small time crook in over his head, he is no good guy but he is no killer either. Jack's associates at work are also shady, Nina Myers is his trusted assistant but she is also a great liar, George Mason is crooked in the sense that he stole drug money from a suspect, but he is a good guy in other respects. People are always lying to each on this show, deceiving each other, either because they have to, or because they think it is the best thing to do at the moment, etc. Now this show does glorify the CIA, it is most definitely an unrealistic representation of that organization. In real life the CIA is simply EVIL!!! But in this show it is only amoral or shady, doing whatever it has to for the greater good. That being said this is a TV show, so reality can take a back seat while watching it. But everyone should know that in the real world the CIA would probably be engineering the hit on Palmer, not stopping it. This series has more twists and turns than any other show in the history of TV, but surprisingly very few of them are groaners. Most of the surprises and plot twists are pretty good, and some are downright revelations. If I had to pick one hour that was my favorite it would have to be 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. WOW!!! That is the most intense hour of the whole series! The whole thing between Ira and Jack, man that was great, especially the ending for that hour, take about a twist!!! FOX deserves credit for being brave enough to put this show on the air after 9/11. I will never forget the first episode that came on about a month later. On the very first episode a plane full of people were killed by a terrorist with a bomb. Now Fox could have pulled that part or changed it but they did not, and it was the right thing to do. Art is supposed to reflect life and pretending 9/11 did not happen would have been pointless. But when the plane blew up on that first episode, oh man, did it hit close to home, it did not seem farfetched at all!!! Never has a show maintained such a high level of suspense for so long, this show is exhausting and very, very violent for regular TV. The ending is BRUTAL!!!! This show covers a lot of touchy topics, race, rape, dirty politics, dirty government agencies, conspiracies, moral ambiguity, etc. Really nothing is sacred on this show. The real time thing is strictly adhered to and the makers of the show managed to make the endings of each hour a cliffhanger. This a show that is not scared to be controversial. This show puts its audience through the ringer hour after hour after hour, until you cant take it any more but beg for more! 24 is shocking, scary, intense, crazy, upsetting, exciting, you get emotionally invested most in Jack's family, especially Kim. Buy 24, watch, then spend the next 24 hours trying to catch your breath!",1080604800,,5342,4.305858987090367
1522420,5,B00005JLF2,"The 24 concept was a risky one. It was a show that, as likely as to become a hit, was likely to be an utter failure. It took great writing, fantastic directing and brilliant editing to make this strictly real-time show exciting enough to work; and though the concept began to fail in the following (still excellent) seasons, in the first one the real-time rule is very strict indeed. Each episode takes precisely one hour (including commercials); the event occurring in each episode take precisely an hour in the reality of the show. By keeping a steady rhythm of non-stop action and suspense, as well as truly surprising plot-twists, and top-notch editing which uses excellent and original technique (split screens, showing different events occurring in different places at the same time), 24 is one of the most suspenseful, exciting programs seen on television.
Risky, I say, not only because of the real-time concept, but also because it is absolutely essential to watch every episode of the season to truly appreciate it. It's very difficult to make the viewers interested enough to watch every single episode. That is why most series give more weight to each episode as a whole, rather than an entire season; in 24, the whole is much, much more than the sum of its parts. Each season of 24 functions as a complete work, more like a 24 hour movie than a TV series. In that aspect, it may be the most impressive product of American television since the first season of Twin Peaks (the one directed by David Lynch). That is why, like Twin Peaks, 24's first season is well worth owning on DVD. I actually know many people who, seeing only some of the episodes while it was aired on TV, were not too interested, but became hooked when they saw it from the beginning on DVD. 24 truly is a series that rewards the loyal viewer like few others.
The leading man here is, of course, Kiefer Sutherland. Kiefer made a transition that is quite the opposite of the norm: he went from a career as a second-rate film actor, to a first class TV superstar. Although the character of Jack Bauer becomes much more complex in the second and third seasons, one of television's most fascinating anti-heroes, Kiefer manages to impress in this season as well. He is overshadowed, though, by some fantastic supporting actors - Sarah Clarke as Jack's partner, Nina; Carlos Bernard as co-worker Tony Almeida, who balances out Jack and becomes one of the most important characters in the following seasons; the impressive Dennis Haysbert as the dead-serious idealist Senator David Palmer; Penny Johnson as his snaky wife, Sherry; Misha Collins, Zeljko Ivanek, Michael Massee and Richard Burgi as the wonderful villains; and a surprising first-rate superstar as the lead villain, whose identity it would be a shame to reveal to someone who is yet to watch the series. And last but most certainly not least, Xander Berkeley as George Mason, the egocentric, the sarcastic, the corrupted, but ultimately the most real and human character on this show. Berkeley becomes especially impressive in the second season, but in this one he does have his moments.
It's hard to write about 24 without spoilers; so I'll kindly stop writing. The bottom line is, this DVD is very much worth the watch, and is a fantastic gift for anyone. I'm yet to meet someone who watched the first episode of the series and didn't become instantly hooked.",1079654400,3,3400,4.8136752136752134

My friend received these for Christmas, and he had never watched them before either, so after he was done, he told me I MUST watch them. I did, and within the first 10 minutes or so of the first episode, I was completely HOOKED!!  I have to say that if you have ANYTHING that needs to be accomplished when you sit down to watch this, you might want to get it done beforehand, because it might not get done at all.  You won't want to stop watching this.  At least I didn't.  I had to force myself away from the DVD in order to fix dinner for my family and clean my house.

Too completely understand 24, you have to watch it from the first episode. Mostly becaase of it's real-time concept, each episode lasting an hour, each series a day, every episode connects to each other, and if you miss one, you miss a vital bit of information.
However, after I bought the DVD set, I watched it in 3 days, (7 on Saturday, because school got in the way) I LOVED IT!!! I didn't think it would be good, but it wasn't. It was great!
24 is about a man Jack Bauer, who must contiuosly save the day, while dealing with personal problems too. The first series is the day of the California Presidential Primary, when Jack has to protect Senator Palmer from an assation attempt. While also trying to find his daughter, Kim, who has been kidnapped. Others are his wife, Teri, and his co-workers, Tony Almeida, Nina Myers, and George Mason.
Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, and his fantastic in the role, Jack Bauer was definately his calling! After taking a break from acting for a couple of years, it was a great comeback. Kim is played by Elisha Cuthbert, who is wonderful at playing her, and getting into trouble. Palmer is played by Dennis haysbert, who is great as a political and family man, while trying to do the right thing for everyone. The other actors make the whole show come together, and they work off each other wonderfully.
I would recommend this set to anyone, whatever age, whatever genre you usually prefer, this set will not disappoint you. I would only say, watch it from the beginning.
Have fun watching 24!!

Dont over analyze!! It's drama!!  Warning to conservative or modest viewers such as myself: I won't reveal anything, but you should be aware there were scenes I was uncomfortable with (in a sexual sense) and had they frequently appeared throughout the series beyond disc one, I would have been disappointed and would have chosen to not continue watching the series. We were disappointed but not suprised that the writers felt they had to include certain scenes to get our interest - we are not so shallow and we may be in the small percentage of people who prefer to watch ""cleaner"" programming. HOWEVER, with that said, it was worth it to ""suffer through"" (you and others may not be as bothered by such scenes). Violence is frequent but necessary to the story line.  We have not completed season two, and again, aren't as crazy about the ""soap opera"" type situations or characters that are woven in, but are still hooked and still enjoying.

1522535,5,B00005JLF2,"In the following I am going to count some of the benefits the viewers get out of watching the amazing ""24"":
1. An insight into the formidable, violent - but also exciting - world of war against terror - ""24"" emerged right after the terror attacks that destroyed the Twin Towers and started to give the horrified, but also curious viewers, a glance at the gray and mysterious area most were vaguely aware of - in a never been seen before approach of 'documenting' events in real time (each episode illustrates the events of a single hour in the lives of the characters).

2. Somebody to admire - There are two dominante roll models in the show:
Jack Bauer, the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) operative, strikes the common viewers as the ultimate hero of all times. Nobody is really close to the level of the combative competence and shrewdness he demonstrates time and again - along side with dedication and commitment to his family and country.
David Palmer, the California presidential candidate, also appears as one of the wisest, most devoted, sincere and patriotic characters ever to hit the small screen.
Nevertheless, both are vulnerable.
3. An escape form reality - Upon watching the series, the viewers are going to forget about everything that bothers them and concentrate on the events that keep on happening by the minute on the screen. The action is non-stop; no other series in the history of television had reached the level of intensity this series has reached. There is nothing else one can think of while watching it that it's almost therapeutic.
4. A family get-together - Finally there's a TV series that can hook everybody - adult and minors - side by side in mutual respect. Yes, it is violent at times, but no more than the things everybody sees in movies and in the news everyday. It is also a great source for conversations and debates about the unconventional, controversial and shocking situations that are presented on the screen in an unprecedented density.
5. Something to look forward to - When was the last time you really waited for a new episode in a TV program? Was it back on the days of ""Dallas""? Well, the drought is over; you are going to stay breathless during and after most of the episodes, anxious to see and know more. The best advice I can give is to take it one at a time.",1068854400,5,2315,4.646341463414634
1522536,5,B00005JLF2,This the best series on the air. I have watched it from the first season.,1067731200,,73,3.933333333333333
1522537,5,B00005JLF2,"Being an action movie junkie, I thought I'd take a look at some of the newer TV programs out these days.  When I was younger, action TV shows, due to low budgets, generally featured everything BUT action (A-Team and Airwolf come to mind), but today's shows come off like big-budget films.  Content is also a lot more liberal than it once was, which is a great plus, as these programs no longer insult the viewer's intelligence.
It came down to a decision between two shows, 24 or Alias.  I checked out both, and although Alias seemed to feature more of the things you'd expect from an action show (ie explosions, lots of gunfights), 24 was the better show.  In fact, when Alias premiered, its detractors dubbed it ""24 for teenagers.""  I hate to bash away, but I agree.  Alias is sort of like a WB show, it has all of the things I hate in TV action programs.  For one, romantic subplots take precedence over the action; there are inane comedic bits; puppy dog eyes between the lead female and male characters; quick build-ups and even quicker resolutions to the action scenes - so that the story may return to the aforementioned romantic subplots.
Now, I don't mean to trample on Alias, and I hope those Alias fans out there reserve judgment of my review until they get to the end.  All I'm saying is, the decision between 24 or Alias comes down to what you look for in your action entertainment.  Alias is along the lines of shows like Smallville or Buffy, save for a bit more of a big budget look.  24, though, is more along the lines of the Sopranos or The Shield; there are no romantic subplots, puppy dog eyes, goofy humor.  There's no time for any of that.  Actually, I can make a better comparison.  If you like action movies like Charlie's Angels or XXX, then Alias is for you.  But if you're more into Die Hard or the first two Lethal Weapons, then 24 is the show for you.
The comparison is apt, because I would rank Kiefer Sutherland's character Jack Bauer up there with the best of the action movie heroes.  Like Die Hard's John McClane, he's an everyman caught up in a crazy situation.  And like Lethal Weapon's Riggs, he's also a very dangerous man, who can get even more dangerous when pushed.  The Bauer character is an interesting spin on the action hero archetype.  Generally there are two types, the Everyman (such as McClane, or the Matrix's Neo), or the Superhero (such as James Bond, or most of Arnold Schwarzenegger's early characters).  Bauer is a mixture of the two.  He's a regular guy as far as his family life and fears are concerned, but when the going gets tough, you start to feel sorry for the bad guys.
Most people probably know that 24 was originally greenlit by Fox for 12 episodes.  Halfway through the season, though, Fox greenlit an entire season's worth, which meant that the producers had to begin spinning new webs out of the threads they were in the process of closing.  This means that the first twelve (actually, thirteen) episodes come off like a first-class action movie, with building suspense and reversals that will surprise even the most jaded viewer.  Episode 14, however, begins a downward spiral (amnesia subplots, domestic disputes, etc) that the show struggles for a bit to get out of.  Luckily, things significantly pick up in the final episodes, particularly with episode 20, which is the first appearance of the main villain behind everything.  The final episode especially comes off like a great action film, with the tension and suspense stretched to the breaking point.
The wishy-washy episodes don't take away from the first 13, not at all.  In fact, episodes 1-13 of Season One are some of the best TV I've seen.  You won't believe many of the things that happen, and the television boundaries that are pushed.  People are killed in violent shootouts, mutilated corpses discovered in abandoned cars, heroin used as a painkiller (!), reversals and betrayals galore.  The final episodes pack a wallop too, with a few surprise guest stars.
Everything is great about the production.  The cinematography is great, movie quality for sure.  There are hardly any of those annoying, documentary-style zooms and pans you get in most other TV shows.  And unlike Alias and CSI, there is a healthy lack of dependence upon computer graphics.  Acting is great throughout; none of the campy hamming up you'll get in your average WB-type show.  (Okay, maybe one actor in particular hams it up; of course, I'm talking about Dennis Hopper, but what can you expect?  That's what he does best!)  A lot of money obviously went into the show, but instead of using the money to make soulless eye candy, the producers instead used it to create a quality program with great writing, great characters, and great actors.
The DVD presentation is fine, but I would have liked more extra features.  There's only one deleted scene, from the final episode, and while the video/audio presentation is good, it isn't great.  Most reviewers mention this lack of extras, but most reviewers don't have the heart to tell you this: there are no chapter stops on this DVD!  I have no idea what the producers were thinking.  It's a minor complaint, but it would be nice to access scenes in each show.  At least this was rectified (as well as the extras department) in the Season 2 DVD set.
In short, 24 is boundary-breaking television, up there with the Simpsons, Band of Brothers, and the Sopranos.  Whatever reservations you might have of Kiefer Sutherland in a role like this, get ready to have those reservations blown out of the water.  Sutherland is ON in every episode; he becomes his character in one of the most memorable performances I've seen.  24 is an action fan's dream: a high-quality movie that just keeps going and going.",1067558400,16,5756,4.701596806387226
1522538,3,B00005JLF2,"This is an addendum to my earlier review of 24 Season One where I indicated the Season started great but got a little silly mid-way thru.
Without giving any spoilers I must also criticise parts of the Season Finale which while offering some possible surprises also make no logical sense based on the actions you have seen in the prior 23 episodes.
In other words, after knowing how the first season ends, if you re-watch the whole season from the beginning and pay close attention to the characters, their actions, the opportunites they have and how things evolve, then the surprises at the end of the series are kind of just tossed in as a way to throw you off rather than having any logic or continuity.",1067040000,8,705,4.559055118110236

The acting is very good which I was very pleasantly surprised about. The only shortcoming, which probably is normal due to the nature of this serial, is that its creators had to find unexpected turns and twists so many times that sometimes they sacrifice the logical storyline to be able to surprise us. But even having doubts in my mind about the certain outcomes of show events don't prevent me from being totally consumed by this show.",1065225600,,550,4.565656565656566

Then, on Labor Day, FX ran a marathon. I sat down to watch for awhile, and managed to pull myself away about ten hours later. Two weeks later I bought the DVD set.
This is top notch television at it's finest. Kiefer Sutherland has brought his career back from near death with his portrayal of Jack Bauer. Bauer, a counter terrorist agent, is so single-minded in his drive and devotion to the job, that he doesn't seem to allow anything to stand in his way.
The personal mission in this first season was two fold, save his family from kidnappers, and save the life of a presidential candidate from a hired assasin.
This series proves two things... writing and acting are the single most important elements of any production. A lesson that should be learned by many more television shows and movies.",1064707200,,948,4.615384615384615
1522600,5,B00005JLF2,"If you've ever even thought about buying an entire season of a television program on DVD, look no futher... this is the one to buy.
I had heard many good things about this series and found myself disappointed that I never gave it a chance during its first season. The premise and real-time style of the show sounded very interesting to me. I've also always been a fan of Kiefer Sutherland. To my surprise, my wife bought me this DVD set for my birthday. As it turns out, it became one of my favorite all-time gifts.
Among the sea of cheezy thoughtless ""so-called"" Dramas (cough cough... CSI), 24 has taken the genre to a whole new level of quality television. The characters are sharp, the story is unpredictable, and the quality of the film-work alone gives you the feel that you're watching a major motion-picture rather than a television show.
I wasn't around in the days of serial-style television and radio programs. However, 24 does an excellent job of borrowing its ""cliff-hanger"" elements from that genre. If I would have watched the actual series on television, rather than watching it on DVD, I'm quite convinced that I would have driven myself crazy, having to wait a whole week to see what happens. With the DVD ofcourse, you can get immediate gratification. In fact, not once was I able to restrain myself to watching just a single episode. Three consecutive episodes was my minimum.
24 is one of the few shows that really does live up to the hype!",1064361600,,1461,4.666666666666667
1522601,5,B00005JLF2,"If you want to talk about one intense and unnerving experience, ""24"" is just that.  One of the most popular shows on Fox is now available to own on DVD.  They're all right here, waiting for you.  ""24"" is an explosive series that brings non-stop action and nail-biting drama right to your door.
Jack Bauer is the head of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit, CTU.  He is about to have one bad day, as there is an assassination plot in the works that targets a presidential candidate.  What's worse is that the same group behind the plot wants Jack and his family dead, as well.  Presented to us in real time (with each show representing an hour), we are plunged directly into the crisis with front-row seats.  The results are unbelievable; that much I can tell you.  These twenty-four episodes will drain every bit of energy out of you... and you'll love every minute.
Once you start with the very fist episode, you are hooked.  Every one of them is a cliff-hanger, which makes it very hard for you to stop watching when you need to.  Trust me when I say this; this show does NOT let you off the hook for one second.  Anything you think that can't go wrong, does; anything that you think cannot get compromised, does.  You have to be prepared to be caught off guard every single moment.  You also have to expect that you're going to have to endure horrifying tragedies along with the short and triumphant victories.
This is a wonderful and addicting show, as hard as it is to watch at times.  The storyline is ingenious, delivering one explosive and mesmerizing plot.  The acting is extremely superb and makes everything work.  Kiefer Sutherland does a terrific job at playing the lead role of a resourceful agent and a caring father.  You want to believe that he'll be able to overtake anybody or anything that gets in his way.
There are some neat special features included, as well.  One of the best things about this show is that it is widescreen (and it's even enhanced for 16:4 televisions).  The picture and sound quality is really great; making you feel that you are watching a real movie.  While the DVD set isn't explosive when it comes to special features, the set includes an intro from Kiefer Sutherland, an alternate ending to the season finale,  and an episode booklet.
""24"" is a powerful and suspenseful series that will knock the air right out of your body.  There's no going back once you start.  No matter how many times you may not want to know what happens next (for fear that you will experience something terrible), you press on and continue with the next episode.  This is ADDICTING; be for warned.  From start to finish, this is one explosive and unpredictable machine that strikes with full furry and unquestionable force.  The clock is ticking... what decision will you make?",1064102400,3,2802,4.6214574898785425
1522602,5,B00005JLF2,"Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland) is having one of those days. He is the agent in charge of the Counter Terroist Unit in Los Angeles. At midnight, Jack gets a call from work saying that there has been a threat on presidential nominee Senator David Palmer's ( Dennis Hayworth) life. He is assigned to come up with a strategy to keep Palmer alive. But this is where the story gets interesting. The terrorists manage to get their hands on his wife Teri (Lesli Hope) and his daughter Kim ( Elisha Cuthbert). The terrorists now have leverage over Jack, and he must find a way to keep the Senator alive without getting his wife and daughter killed. Watch Jack in action as he lives on the edge and plays by his own rules, leaving procedure and protocal far behind...
""24"" is a brilliant show that offers plenty of action and suspense to keep you hooked from the first show on. The format of the show is one that has never been done before, because it is done in real time. This means that each show consists of one hour of a 24 hour day. In my opinion, Kiefer Sutherland gives the best performance of his career as Jack Bauer. Sutherland's performance is so good, that you literally find yourself rooting for him throughout the entire show. Dennis Hayworth is superb as Senator David Palmer. He is the first African American presidential nominee in history. You not only get to see him worry about his campaign, but deal with his extremely disfunctional family in the process. Leslie Hope and Elisha Cuthbert also did an outstanding job as Jack's family. Their performances are very realistic and you actually come to care about their characters. The rest of the cast includes great actors like Dennis Hopper, Sarah Clarke, Carlos Bernand, Penny Johnson, and Eric Balfour.

""24"" has the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspense. The acting is absolutely superb all the way around, and each character has an important part to play that could seriously effect the events of the story. The DVD is definately worth the money. You get to see the show without commercial interruption and with awesome picture and sound quality as well. Definately one of the most original and well made TV shows in quite some time!",1064102400,,2202,4.675257731958763
1522603,5,B00005JLF2,"Alright, I admit I ignored the entire first season when it originaly aired.  ""Kiefer Sutherland, on a Fox program?  mmm...yeah he was alright in Young Guns, but... I feel pretty safe in saying I can live without ever seeing this show.""...(or so I thought.)  Then it started getting all these great reviews.  Even still, I didn't know anyone who had ever seen it.
The night the season 2 premiere episode aired, there was nothing else on tv worth watching. So, I asked my wife since there was nothing else worth watching, if she would mind if we went ahead and gave the season opener a shot, sit through it for an hour so we could say we had seen it, and know for sure that we weren't missing anything.  So we sat down and watched, not expecting much, just something to watch while eating dinner.  You know, ho hum.  Get it over with.  But then we started watching it.  Impressive.  Original.  Good character development.  And then comes the end with the signature 24 cliff hanger ...  We just turned and looked at each other with our jaws dropped...  ""Wow!""  ""I can't believe we missed the entire first season!""  Needless to say, we were completely hooked.
Yes, 24 is that good.
I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said.  Except if you have given the show, the first season DVD, or the second season DVD thought, but hesitate because your not Kiefers biggest fan or don't care for shows on Fox, You are missing out.  Like Novels?  Think Tom Clancy.  Are you a gamer?  Think Syphon Filter.  Like thriller tv shows that leave you on the edge of your seat, are worth racing home too, and worth telling your buds that Tuesday nights are not a good night for guys night out?  Think 24.  Both Season one and two are great, and I can't wait for season three to start.
During a three week break during the second season, we went back and rented season one.  We would watch 2 or 3 episodes at a time, staying up much later than normal.  How could anyone not, with the great cliff hangers?
The are only a couple of drawbacks.  As others have commented, Jack's daughter Kim, is just not real bright.  So much that the character gets annoying.  The only other thing being, for being real time, it's intersting that Jack is constantly on his cell phone, yet the phone never dies, so it must have a pretty good battery life.  That, and he never goes to the restroom.  I guess he doesn't need to, because (as best as I can recall), you never see him eat either.  But these are minor details for a great show.
Whether you are watching it on tv, or renting the first or second season on DVD, 24 is great.  It's an exhilerating, heart pounding, plot twisting and turning on the edge of your seat show, that should not be missed.",1063843200,,2726,4.398797595190381

Kiefer Sutherland gives a break through performance as Jack Bauer and the rest of the cast brings a non-stop guessing story to the screen. Writers give the season the feel of watching an amazing film 18 hours long and wanting more. Editing, acting, special effects, and musical are fantasic and its no wonder why the season was nominated for 12 emmys.

Too many freaking plot holes, like when the cute alien makes the little boy on his bike fly across the moon.  That moon is WAY too large.  I think they fixed it in post.  But I digress.  You spend the first ten episodes of 24 hooked, but as you get deeper and deeper, you realize that the writers fall into the X-Files trap of layering twist upon twist until you wish they'd shot the film on a bloody quasar where each hour lasts only twenty seconds and you're done in time to catch Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.

1522659,3,B00005JLF2,"Every five or ten minutes there's a break in the action in this TV series, and a digital clock comes on the screen.  It tells you the exact minute and second of the action within the hour.  Each episode is one hour long.  But there's a problem.  Whoever filled in the digital clock sequences wasn't watching the rest of the show.  The result is that some scenes that in real time take a half minute, take 15 minutes on the digital clock.  Other scenes that look like they took an hour and a half take only 3 minutes on the ditigal clock.  Toward the end of each hour, when there's supposed to be five minutes left on the clock, the show in real time goes through sequences that are impossible within that amount of time.  Now you might ask, is this really bad?  Who looks at the clock anyway?  (Of course, it's hard not to look at the clock; it's the star of the show.)
No, what's really bad is how sloppy and cheap this all is.  The clock has more screen time than anyone else except Kiefer Sutherland but no one gave the clock a copy of the script.  And the clock isn't quite as versatile an actor as Kiefer, who keeps a pretty straight face.  At least he's read the script.  Obviously the producers here weren't looking at all aspects of the production, and it shows in other ways -- in plot inconsistencies.  I wouldn't be saying all this if I didn't think that 24 deserved to be much much better.  It's well written, well acted, dramatic, intense.  But there would have been more truth in advertising if the show had been titled, ""The Clock That Didn't Know What Time It Was.""",1060992000,6,1581,4.3231292517006805
1522660,5,B00005JLF2,"When 24 first came on the air, I watched it and was amazed at how good it was.  The idea of waiting one week (and occasionally longer) was frustrating because I wanted to know what would happen next.  Unfortunately, I got sidetracked in the middle of the season and having missed a couple episodes, knew I had to wait for the DVD release.
How good is this show?  Even knowing certain key facts about the conclusion (gleaned from second season commercials which I couldn't avoid), I still found the show to be thrilling from beginning to end.
The plot of the show deals with government agent Jack Bauer who has his wife and daughter kidnaped by mysterious figures who also intend to kill a presidential candidate.  There are enough twists to turn this straightforward idea into an intricate pretzel, and though there are the occasional last minute rescues, you never feel cheated by what's going on.
Beyond the story, what adds to this show is that everyone - both good guys and bad guys - are very professional.  Jack is up against some formidable foes, but he is quite formidable himself.  He is human, however, and you never quite know how things are going to turn out.
While the real-time concept of the show often stretches (the characters can seeming zip between any two points in the LA area in half an hour), it never breaks.  Think of this boxed set as an eighteen hour action movie that never lets up.  Actually, this is better than 99% of the action movies out there, so it is well worth the price.

1522664,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" is an intense and addictive show. Many shyed away from this show because they feared that if they were to miss an episode, they would be completely lost. This DVD is the perfect way for those who missed this season to find out what they were missing.
The premise of the show is listed above, so I will not go over it again. The main players are Jack Bauer, Senator David Palmer, Teri Bauer, Kim Bauer, Nina Meyers, etc.
The first 10 or so episodes are simply a work of art. They flow so well, the double-crosses are unexpected, the stories are riveting. Everything simply fits. The suspense is so high that you will blow through these episodes and be unable to stop.
Things do slow down after about halfway through. That doesn't mean things get bad or anything, by no means. The second half of the season is better than practically anything else on TV, just not as brilliant as the first.
In what would look to some as a simple game of intrigue and gunfights, there are real emotions at stake too. ""24""'s characters are believable and the drama is touching. Particularly David Palmer's dilemma over his family's troubles, which he prioritizes far above the assassination threats against him.
The DVD set is good, but fairly bare bones. There is an alternate ending that changes things completely, but it doesn't make quite as much sense as the actual one, and kills a lot of the drama. It's disappointing that there are no chapters, so if you stop watching halfway through an episode, you'll have to fast forward to get back to your place.
This show is one of the best shows on the air, and owning the DVD set is well worth it. There are episodes that you'll want to watch again and again, particularly the pilot episode. Buy it, you'll be glad you did.",1057363200,3,1758,4.531446540880503

1522667,5,B00005JLF2,"I have to admit that when I heard about 24's format -- the entire season's output focusing on the events of one day -- I was skeptical.  No matter how intricate or exciting the storyline was, surely television audiences would not be patient enough to watch the hour-by-hour account of one federal agent's mission to prevent the assasination of a presidential candidate on the day of the California Democratic primary.
Unsure about this concept, I tuned in to the first episode in the fall of 2001...and became an instant fan of 24.  I watched about 22 episodes on first run...missing only a couple due to outside obligations or cable TV outages.  Now that I own the boxed set of Season One, I have seen the entire series and can now write a few words about it.
Although it is very much an action-suspense thriller (closer to Tom Clancy than to Ian Fleming), 24's tale of vendetta-driven terrorists plotting to kill Sen. David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert)on the day of the California primary is also the intimate story of the implosion of three families.
First, the Bauer family.  When we first see Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), the setting is almost dully domestic -- he's playing a game of chess with his teenage daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). But shortly before he gets a call from one of his fellow agents in the Counter Terrorist Unit, we see the domestic tranquility is belied by some tension.  Kim is openly rude to her mother, Teri (Leslie Hope) and will soon sneak out to go partying with her friend Janet....which will be one of the worst choices she's ever made.  And as we watch the series unfold, we'll learn about the straining effects of Jack's job on the marriage and of Jack's affair with fellow CTU agent Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke).
The second family implosion involves the Palmer family.  Just as it seems everything is going perfectly for Sen. Palmer and his picture perfect family, we see as 24 unfolds that all is not well here, either.  Skeletons from the Palmer children's past are surfacing on the very day that David Palmer seems poised to win his party's nomination for the Presidency, and he is forced to see how far his ambitious wife Sherry (Penny Jerald Johnson) will go to keep ugly family secrets out of the public eye.
And finally, there is the Drazen clan. Serb nationalists who supported Milosevic's iron-fisted rule, they were targeted by American forces and lost several family members as a result of a covert operation to take out the Drazen patriarch.  Now they are bent on revenge and will do anything and kill anyone to get it.
Yes, 24 does have its flaws (the travails of wayward Kim and Teri's amnesia are a bit over-the-top for some viewers), but overall this is a fine piece of television drama.",1055980800,38,2738,4.7112970711297075

In all honesty, I don't really watch a lot of TV, but I liked Kiefer Sutherland's films, so I gave the show a chance. I'm glad I did. ""24"" was the perfect platform for Kiefer, he plays the desperate family man and determined government agent to perfection. The show was interesting, much better then stuff that had been released in recent years. Unlike mindless sitcoms, it had weight and issues. Unlike sappy dramas and sensless action sequences, it had intrigue as well as a conpelling storyline. ""24"" was critically acclaimed but not huge hit, FOX wasn't even sure if they would have the full 24 episodes for the first season, but they thought that the ratings were high enough to at least finish the season all the way through. Though the second half of the show was slower then the first, it ended with a bang. Jack Bauer gun fighting with his enemies at the end, a gun in each hand and blasting away was one of the coolest scenes I have seen on TV. The determination of Kiefer's Jack Bauer was admirable, a man that wanted to save his family no matter what, but felt a responsibility to do his job at the same time, it was a conflict that caused you to like him even more. ""24"" was one of the best shows I have seen on TV and better then half of the Hollywood  released into theaters. Season Two if ""24"" was even better but that is a review for another time.

1522711,5,B00005JLF2,"I have always liked FOX's ambitious and inventive spirit as a network, competing against the big three giants of the television industry: CBS, ABC, and NBC.  Some of the network's show ideas have gone under, but 24 defies convention, as it never fails to deliver suspense each hour.  Give 24 a quick look and you are hooked to the very end.  Despite some rather corny, cookie-cutter moments (i.e. Teri Bauer's stint with amnesia), 24 is an intelligent, original, and fresh thrill ride of a show.
Season 1 of 24, dubbed as ""The Longest Day"" ranges from 12:00am to 12:00am, the full day of the presidential primary in Los Angeles.  The story revolves around two men: Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), an African-American presidential candidate, who is the target of assassination on that day, and CTU (CounterTerrorist Unit) agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), the man whose mission is to protect Palmer and thwart the terrorists behind the plot of achieving their goal.  However, Bauer's mission has become personal. His daughter, Kim and eventually his wife, Teri are kidnapped and they, along with Bauer, are also targeted by the very same people threatening Palmer. But why? You would have to see how this plot unravels.  To make matters harder, some of the people Jack works with at CTU, are working for the terrorists.  Jack has the arduous task to protect Palmer and save his family, while having the right frame of mind on who to trust and not to trust in his mission to realize both his aims.
24 is wonderfully crafted and complicated that demands the viewer to watch its episode carefully, because of its meticulous real-time format.  The pulse-pounding suspense can let up at certain points, but the transition scenes, whether it would be a shocking development or a pivotal juncture, kicks up the suspense a notch higher.  But what makes 24 so effective is the superb acting of Kiefer Sutherland, who is in a word, masterful as Jack Bauer.  He portrays Bauer as the gritty consummate professional, who would do just about anything to get the job done, even if it means walking the fine line of good and evil.  At the same time, Sutherland elicits sympathy as a family man, with the desperation of a second crack at family togetherness.  Haysbert pulls out a tremendous performance as Senator Palmer, an honorable and honest politician who believes in upholding the righteous ideals of American democracy.  Worthy of mention is Penny Johnson Jerald, who plays Sherry Palmer, David's wife, a conniving, greedy woman, wanting nothing more than the power and popularity of being the First Lady.  The two Bauer women, Teri, played by Leslie Hope and Kim, portrayed by the eye-catching Elisha Cuthbert, are solid in dealing with the unpredictability of their days.  Nina Myers, played by the sultry Sarah Clarke, is impressive as Bauer's reasonably trustworthy secretary, with something up her sleeve.  The rest of the supporting cast, from top to bottom are also wonderful.
In my opinion, the first season of 24 is slightly better than its successive second season because it is more unpredictable and provides higher shock value.  For those who have not seen 24 in its entirety, it is best not to reveal the story and its highly detailed events in greater detail.  Just sit back and watch how the story unravels, with loads of startling developments and intensity, leading up to the unforgettable, piece-de-resistance ending.  I highly recommend this along with the second season DVD set, which is slated for a September release.",1055462400,34,3543,4.98471986417657
1522712,2,B00005JLF2,"The concept of the show is very good, it s true, but the story is plain stupid.

To guess what s going to happend next, just ask yourself ""what could go wrong ?"" and it ll happend.

1522713,4,B00005JLF2,"Let's face it, good shows on TV are hard to come by.  This is especially true of FOX, which seems almost eager to kill off anything even remotely interesting (""Futurama"" and ""Brimstone"" just to name two) in order to make room for crap like ""Joe Millionaire"", ""Mr. Personality"" or ""American Idol.""  Never the less, FOX has managed to make one smart move: the show ""24"", which has just miraculously been renewed for a 3rd season.
Quite simply, ""24"" is the only thing really worth watching on FOX, except possibly for ""The Simpsons"", which is starting to show its age.  Kiefer Sutherland is literally awesome as Jack Bauer, a man willing to protect his family and his country at any cost.  It's Sutherland's convincing and charismatic acting that makes it all too easy to forgive and forget the show's faults.  Equal praise must also be given, however, to Dennis Haysbert (Senator David Palmer), Penny Johnson (the scheming Sherry Palmer), and Zeljko Ivanek (the chilling Andre Drazen).  Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeida) and Xander Berkeley (George Mason), make their first appearances here, but neither really shine until later in Season 2.
The show makes good use of the real-time format, which is both its strength and weakness.  It makes the show incredibly addictive (its like the TV form of Crack), but only if you catch it from the beginning.  Even with the recap (which is conspicuously absent from this set), you'll just be too lost if you come in at the middle of the season. (Thankfully this is not a problem with the box-set.)  When you watch it, you'll be amazed how much can happen in a limited time period, even if it isn't actually a full hour.  FOX ought to do what they did at the start of Season 2 and just show each episode uninterrupted.
When focusing on Jack, the writing is top-notch.  His tendency to bend the rules gets him into trouble as often as it gets him out of it.  The show throws one obstacle after another in front of him, giving Jack (and the audience) little time to breathe until the episode's end.  Haysbert's Senator Palmer faces a similar fate, juggling a presidential campaign, an assassination threat, his wife's dishonesty, and a scandal involving his son.  Despite this, the show's pacing (which the format contributes to) never seems excessive.  It's a roller coaster ride, but one that's never jarring or uneven.
Unfortunately, when the show switches to the kidnapping of Bauer's daughter and later his wife, the writing starts to get bogged down.  After a while, the kinds of perils they face begin to border on the ridiculous (Daughter Kim gets kidnapped or almost kidnapped more time than can be counted, Wife Teri develops temporary amnesia.)  Also, the writers seem to have trouble with women characters.  Both Kim and Teri are remarkably whiny even beyond what might be expected for what they've been through, and Kim has all the common sense of a sleep-deprived spider-monkey.  Nina Myers has one or two good scenes, but her character doesn't get really interesting until the end of Season 1.  Sherry Palmer is about the only interesting female character on the show.
Despite these flaws, ""24"" is still easily the one of the best shows currently on TV, blowing CSI and even the latest seasons of Law & Order completely out of the water.  In fact, ""24"" easily ranks up with ""The Sopranos"", ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", and the earlier seasons of ""Law & Order"", as one of the best shows TV has ever aired. So forget...""American Idol"".  Tune in an hour later for ""24"".",1054857600,,3516,4.7864238410596025

In my opinion, the episodes on disk 3 are most important (and also most entertaining) to all viewers, whether you are watching this series all over again or just watching it for the first time, because not until now does its intriguing plot begin to unfold, and boy does it unfold in a brilliant manner. I had to watch episode 12 twice in a row and enjoyed every minute (yeah, some pun intended) of the initial and intense confrontations between four main characters, Jack/David and Teri/Nina. We rarely see television actors perform their roles this well, trust me. Actually I gotta say that I am kind of disappointed about Penny Johnson being cast as Sherry Palmer and Vicellous Reon Shannon as Keith Palmer, but I am totally amazed at the performances of Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Leslie Hope and Sarah Clarke, as Jack Bauer, David Palmer, Teri Bauer and Nina Myers, respectively.",1051574400,,974,4.769230769230769

1522785,5,B00005JLF2,"RELENTLESS!  If there is one word that can describe what watching ""24"" is like, it's relentless.  There are few TV shows on the air today or that have aired throughout history that have the ambition to try what ""24"" tried and the skill to pull it off so seamlessly.  For those who have been living under a rock for the past two years, Season 1 of ""24"" tells the real time story of the events surrounding an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate.  The caveat is that this is no ordinary candidate.  David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is the first African-American candidate with a legitimate chance to win the White House.  His potential presidency is of paramount importance to the country.  His assassination would prove disastrous.  To compromise Palmer's security, the terrorists have managed to infiltrate Los Angeles Counter-Terrorism Unit (CTU) on the day of the California primary.  The security breach allows the terrorists access the man whose responsibility is to weed out the terrorist threats and keep Palmer alive, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland).  The terrorists kidnap his family and keep Jack jumping through hoops in a dual-pronged effort to save his family and protect Palmer.  All of this occurs over the course of one 24-hour period.  It's the longest day of Jack Bauer's life.

The concept of ""24"" seemed very difficult to buy into at first.  As a result, I did not watch any of Season 1 when it was broadcast and have not watched any of Season 2 so far.  Yet, glowing reviews and recommendations led me to get this DVD collection and watch it from start to finish.  It is an incredibly well-produced and well-acted show.  Most big-budget movies are not as well-crafted as ""24"".  The concept of telling the story in real time presents many difficulties and is rarely attempted as a thematic device (see 1995's Johnny Depp movie ""Nick of Time"" for a big screen example of this device).  It does add to the suspense and drama, however, because every event must happen in a realistic time period.  For example, you couldn't very well have a character hop in a vehicle one side of Los Angeles and be completely on the other side by the time a commercial break is over.  So, even the smallest of details, like a long red light, play a major role in impacting all developments in this ongoing story.  The production team for ""24"" doesn't miss a trick, though.  The real time element is kept as honest as possible and not one single episode feels as though it's filler that is just using time to get from one point of the plot to the other.

Excellent storytelling and tight plotting aside, ""24"" would not be able to work if it were not for the outstanding performances of a highly skilled cast.  Kiefer Sutherland is the most well-known of all the actors and he brings his own special brand of harried desperation to the role of Jack Bauer.  Sutherland is the perfect actor for this role because he brings the perfect blend of sympathy and uncertainty to his role.  The audience truly feels for Bauer as he deals with the events of this day, but they also feel on edge because they don't know how far over the line he is willing to go to achieve his objective (he shoots one of his superiors in the leg with a tranquilizer in the first episode just to get some withheld information from him.  Haysbert brings a true sense of presidential bearing to his role as Senator Palmer.  He's a good man that the audience can easily believe is presidential material.  (Heck if David Palmer were a real candidate, I'd vote for him).  Leslie Hope (Teri Bauer) and Elisha Cuthbert(Kim Bauer) demonstrate the appropriate level of terror one would espect them to feel as the captured wife and daughter of Jack Bauer, respective.  Sarah Clarke is also quite good as Jack's second in command at CTU, Nina Meyers.  Even smaller players like Tony Almeida (played by Carlos Bernard) and George Mason (played by skilled character actor Xander Berkeley) provided added weight to the already strong story.

It's important in this review not to reveal any of the twists and turns that take place throughout the 24 hours.  If you haven't seen the show yet (as I hadn't before seeing it on DVD), the story developments will blow you away.  ""24"" is truly a masterful piece of work and I cannot wait until Season 2 is available so I can watch that from start to finish, too",1050883200,5,4367,4.68503937007874

It was hard to imagine a show of 24 episodes portraying what a movie might cover in one-tenth the time. However, it is very active (not just jiggly cameras and rapid scene transitions) and keeps your attention. There is a lot going on and it is done very well -- almost movie quality viewing.

The DVD is great!  Not only can I watch this show on my own time frame without missing an episode but having a DVD has caused me to use the pause and rewind features quite often.  With so many little clues, the DVD works wonders in terms of having control over reviewing details I had questions about. (for example, is that man really calling Janet for his own ""daughter's"" best interest? Rewind and pause to see from where he is calling from!) It also enabled me to pause and think about what is going on without missing the next scene in this fast paced drama.

It feels like a rush job, from the lack of extras (no trailers, no TV spots, no commentaries, no special features, virtually no language options, just a 90-second intro by Keifer Sutherland) and the alternate ending to the final episode (which really isn't that different, it only differs from the regular episode by a few minutes, the bad guy is still the same, and the only thing that changes is the status of Bauer's wife).  On at least one occaision the transfer is fuzzy with a hair on the screen, and there is no chapter selection in the episodes.  Lose your place and be prepared to fast-forward through the whole thing until you find where you left off.
  As I mentioned above, the quality of the series is excellent.  If the rendion of this show onto DVD was as good as many other series such as the X-files with it's whole disk of bonus features and extras, then I would not be able to recommend this product highly enough.  Of course, critics will point out that this is beacuse the X-files have been around nearly 10 years now; it makes sense that they would be able to take their time making a quality transfer.  This is true, but I still think it would have been worth the wait if they had taken their time and done a better job of it with 24.  While this is a great way of getting your hands on every episode and being able to fully enjoy the series at your own pace, I must say I am disappointed by the format.",1046736000,12,1864,4.337175792507205

I was hooked immediately!  24 has everything: a great plot, excellent characters, and so many twists and turns that you are always on the edge of your seat.  There is always something going on and very few slow spots.
Since the show is all about one day, you should really watch them in order, and the DVD allows you watch them commercial free and continuously.  I was so addicted I watched four episodes (one disc) a night.  If I weren't working, I could watch the whole season straight through.",1045872000,,637,4.138211382113822

The character development, the interaction between good and evil, and the amazing action scenes (especially the scene at the dock in the last episode) have made this my favorite television series. Owning the DVD makes it that much easier to relive the incredible events of the first season. I could not recommend this more highly to anyone who loves good television. You could even treat this as a 16-hour movie, in which case, it's definitely worth watching. The real-time format of the show is a gimmick that works very well, but even without it, ""24"" would still be a gem.",1045526400,,623,4.777777777777778
1522948,5,B00005JLF2,"The first 12 hours of this series are so unbearably suspenseful the DVD ought to come with some sort of warning for the infirm, the faint of heart, and those expecting a traditional spy flick. Never has gut-wrenching terror been so much fun.
The plot is the same CIA/political assassination/family in danger hugger-mugger we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference here is the beautiful execution. Few feature films have been so unnerringly directed for maximum suspense. The writers somehow manage to make most of this super-plotty intrigue spring from their surprisingly complex characters. Despite the real-time, the drama comes from choices as much as logistics.
It's also amazingly sustained. Though the series takes a slight breather after episode 13, the thickening plot and solid characterizations keep it addictive. Only in the final three hours does 24 run out of gas, as Dennis Hopper's direct-to-video Serbian accent signals a descent into standard action flick silliness that includes a misguided repitition of the done to death family-in-danger bit, a 'shocking' final twist that makes little sense and does nothing for the story, and a tragic ending made to somehow seem irrelevant to everything else going on.
But, why quibble? Taken as a massive single story, 24 is punishingly addictive, a genuine thrill ride. If it can't sustain all the way to the finish, few would have expected it to get so far, so fantastically.",1045440000,2,1447,5.188034188034188

The first night we intended to go out and meet friends, but ended up calling to cancel. The next day we both had work but phoned in ill. The weekend began but we entirely missed it. The pizza delivery guy even started to call me by my name, even if it was difficult for anyone else to recognize me because of the beard I'd grown from not shaving. Don't be fooled, this DVD set of the first series is addictive. Kiefer Sutherland and the rest of the cast are brilliant, the action non-stop, and each episode ends with a cliff hanger that will leave you with no realistic choice other than to watch the next. Start watching it and you might as well forget about eating, seeing friends, going to work, or doing anything else productive. Just make sure you have plenty of beers in the fridge, the phone is switched off, and your TV can cope with nearly 24 hours of non-stop usage. Brilliant!",1045440000,4,986,4.364130434782608

1523011,5,B00005JLF2,"Watching a couple episodes of ""24"" on TV, enjoying its structure and non-stop plot, I bought the DVD package of the show's first season because I didn't get to see all the episodes. Because I'd missed key twists, I didn't watch the full series, so I was incredibly glad when they released this so quickly.
In my own time and at my own pace, I could watch how the day unfolded for CTU agent Jack Bauer and his family. I could try and figure out the villains of the show, and I could try to understand how presidential candidate David Palmer and his wife Sherry were working against each other on the day of the primary. Using the DVD, as well, I could go back and forth over the twists, analyzing things that I'd missed, and determining what clues could help me figure out what was going to happen next.
""24"" is fun - brilliant, suspenseful fun that keeps you enthralled for a very, very long day. It manages to juggle the fates of dozens of characters without much confusion. Few plot twists, with the exception of Teri's late-in-the-game amnesia, are completely out of left field. And the ending shocker is a payoff to anyone who's invested time in the show.
The format and pacing of ""24,"" clever as they are, wouldn't work without the quality acting and directing in the show, though. Penny Johnson Jerald, Keifer Sutherland and Dennis Haysbert are standout talents.
The second season, which I've been watching every week, is even better than the first, so I'm hoping the DVD for that one is released quickly.",1043971200,3,1511,4.6
1523012,5,B00005JLF2,"For those of you who missed the boat last year, here's your chance to see the best and most innovative show on television.  For those of you that have just started watching this year, you now can find out what happened between Nina and Jack.
For those who don't know, ""24"" goes in real time.  That means each 24 episode represents one hour that shows events as they happen within that hour.  The plot revolves around an assassination attempt to kill a Presidential candidate.
Kiefer Sutherland is simply outstanding as Jack Bauer, the CTU agent trying to stop the plot.  He is intense but, at the same time, very caring for the people around him.  Most of the rest of the cast is outstanding, including Dennis Hopper, whose role I can't give away without ruining the show.  The story is excellent and filled with twists throughout the show.
The only drawback to the show (both this season and last) is Jack's daughter Kim.  She is simply one of the stupidest characters in television history.  I can't give too much away, but, if you've seen this season, you know what I'm talking about.
If you're a fan of suspense and good television, you have to have 24 in your collection.",1043884800,6,1176,4.5933014354066986
1523013,5,B00005JLF2,"When I saw commercials for ""24"" a while back, I thought Fox just created another awful show.  In fact, the initial ratings were so bad that there was a distinct chance that 24 would only last 13 episodes (Fox only ordered 13 episodes to start with).  Well, as we all know, it did finish, and they started a new season.  I was shocked because all signs showed that ""24"" would not have been renewed.  Then it occurred to me - they might have kept it around because it was good.
Critics were saying it's a great show, but then again, these were the same critics that found shows like ""Will and Grace"" funny, so I gave them no thought.  Out of pure boredom I rented the first disc.  I was instantly hooked.  This series was unique.  Every scene was action-packed, fast paced, intriguing, smart, and well written.  When I say fast paced and action packed, I'm not talking about mindless explosions, senseless killings, and pointless car chases.  I'm speaking of mystery, fallibility, surprises, and suspense.  This series is filled with twists and turns, but unlike ever-other show with twists and turns, these twists enhance the plot, force us to think, and are never, ever contrived.
The show concerns an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate, which mingles the lives of Jack Bauer, his wife, his daughter, his coworkers, the terrorists, and the presidential candidates' family.  Unlike a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, this movie avoids every clich in the book.  Characters development occurs, and people's true colors, motivations, failings, and strengths all show up.  The typical dividing line between good and bad is divided and spliced with every episode.  The best way to put it is that the real-time action kept me on the edge of the seat, the plot and characters kept me hooked.
There were some flaws with it.  After the 13th episode, there was a considerable drop-off in quality (a character suffered amnesia for a while, causing me to say ""oh no""), but the final episodes put the series back on track.
DVD, not TV, is the best way to watch it.  It is something that deserves your full attention, and should not be spread out over 24 weeks with commercial interruptions.  In terms of extras, this DVD does offer much, except an alternative ending and a small commercial, but then again, it doesn't need to.
So quit reading this and start watching ""24""!  It's the greatest action show ever!",1043798400,5,2402,4.800486618004866
1523014,4,B00005JLF2,"This show started with a bang, kept me enthralled throughout all the episodes, and showed that experimentation with style can be extremely rewarding.  My only real complaint stylistically is that it seemed to take itself too seriously and yet not seriously enough at times.  There are surprises all throughout, yet many felt forced and would have been better if they had been planned out further ahead of time in the writing.
Yet do not be fooled, this is one of the best action shows that have hit television in recent memory.  Fine acting as well.
Highly recommended.",1043712000,,569,4.845360824742268
1523015,5,B00005JLF2,"Although season one of ""24"" contains its fair share of plot holes, massive contrivances, overheated dialogue, and far-out ideas, all is easily forgiven. ""24"" makes for some seriously addictive TV because it offers something that's in painfully short supply in Hollywood, whether on the big or small screen: genuine suspense. I had sort of a vague feeling throughout that things would turn out for the best, but with people getting killed left and right it's obvious that no one's safe. The show's writers prove themselves to be masters at keeping the plot moving along while throwing so many surprises your way you'll probably give up trying to guess what's going to happen about halfway through. The next stunning twist or revelation is never far away, and you can rarely be sure who's good or bad. As the interwtined plots develop, they come to encompass a combination of international cloak-and-dagger workings, back-room political machinations, revenge plots, and family melodrama. Although ""24"" has plenty of bullets flying around, it's definitely not an action show.  Rather, it's a suspense show with action in it.  It's more about building tension, and showing how the tension effects the characters, than anything else.  Kiefer Sutherland gives an appropriately serious performance as Jack Bauer, the noble government agent who's trying to piece his family back together after the demands of his work has driven it apart. The supporting cast is mostly excellent as well, and the foreboding score helps crank up the already tense atmosphere. ""24"" broke new ground here, and it's continuing to do so with its so-far excellent second season. This six-disc set is worth every penny.",1043712000,,1687,5.194852941176471

1523017,4,B00005JLF2,"It's just after midnight at the Bauer home.  They're getting ready for bed when Jack gets a phone call asking him to report to work at the Counter Terrorism Unit in Los Angeles.  There he's briefed on a plot to assassinate Presidential candidate David Palmer.  Meanwhile, his daughter Kim has snuck out of the house to meet some guys who are bad news.  His wife Terri is finding trouble searching for Kim.  And Palmer is facing a crisis of his own concerning something in his family's past he didn't even know about.  It's going to be a long day for everyone.
This thriller series is innovative.  Each episode represents just one hour in the day.  I wasn't sure they could pull if off, but the writers managed to keep all the plots going and make the gaps between seeing characters believable.  It quickly turned into a weekly addiction that had me glued to my seat and dreading commercials more then normal.  Some of the plots loose steam in the afternoon, but it builds up tension again for the climax, which was the best hour of television last season, period.
Unfortunately, this set wasn't all it could have been.  They removed the ""previously on 24"" recaps, which are very useful if you just want to pop a random disc into the machine.  Ironically, they also don't have a play all feature, which would go well with no recaps.  The worst thing, in my opinion, is the lack of chapter breaks in each episode.  The season 1 intro (on the last disc) is ok and includes a mention of this season.  Of course, at this point, we're far beyond anything they would have told us in the set.  The best feature is the alternate ending.  While (to my surprise) I prefer the original, it's nice to see what might have been.  As you would expect, the picture and audio quality are top notch.
It's a shame this great show didn't get the DVD treatment it deserved.  I'm willing to overlook the lack of extras because of timing, but the lack of the recap & chapter breaks really bothers me.  Even so, it's a good set of a great show worth using to catch up or remember this innovative program.",1043280000,129,2079,4.464190981432361

Ok theres the plot now heres the review of the DVD
Picture-4.9 out of 5 there was a couple glitches not to big though.
Sound-4.5 out of 5 is was Dolby not 5.1 though
Cover Art,DVD discs-5 out of 5  The Cover was stunning as well with the discs!
Special Features-1 out of 5 Only 3 extras?! They only had the alternate ending,alternate ending with commentary,And Kiefers intro to 24 with Season 2 teaser which was him talking,not scenes. Season 2 is going be better although one was excellent! They should have put more extras hopefully the will with Season 2 DVD like commentary,bloobers,etc
Overall-9.5 out of 10
Thats a A only problem was the extras,the sound I minded. So I use the ratings 1,2,3,4,5 as A,B,C,D,F  5 Stars a incredible show.

1523151,5,B00005JLF2,"I have felt, as did so many of the other reviewers here, that current television programming quality may slowly be circling the drain. The one shining beacon of hope on the landscape is the Fox series ""24"", a show clearly in another league-heads and shoulders in quality above the rest of the current crop of television offerings.
I never paid much attention to ""24"" during the 1st season; upon hearing about it from others I decided to watch a couple of season 2 episodes, and was understandably confused. Upon receiving the Season 1 DVD set for Christmas, I plunged in, watching 4 to 6 episodes at a time! In fact, I feel that the best way to watch this set is to view 4 or so episodes at a time; that way you get continuity and yet don't experience total emotional burnout. :)
I am a long-time fan of international espionage stories as well as those about political intrigue; I appreciate the works of Tom Clancy, Nelson de Mille and John LeCarre, as well as the great political novels by Allen Drury. ""24"" seems to blend international intrigue, military might, political gamesmanship and basic law enforcement stories with aplomb, moving seamlessly from one world to the next and back again, while creating new and unexpected alliances between.
No punches are pulled where the depravity of man is at issue; the evil ones here are ruthlessly cruel and thoroughly corrupt in their pursuit of their agendas. This helps to create the overwhelming sense of dread and hopelessness which characterizes Jack Bauer's mood throughout the entire series (and overwhelms the sympathetic viewer as well).
The musical underscore by Sean Callery is first-rate. Fans of television's La Femme Nikita series may recognize similarities with Mr. Callery's scores for that show. (Being a composer myself, it is always rewarding to come upon a  new voice in the field.) Mr. Callery blends orchestral muscle and lyrical emotional depth with contemporary drum loops and percussion soundscapes to communicate an urgency and a global feel that support the spy-terrorism-intrigue setting with great success.

I have a huge collection of movies, all on DVD, and that's what I liked to watch until one day I didn't feel like watching a movie and decided to tune in to Fox just for kicks. It was then that I incidentally stumbled upon the premier of season 2 for 24, and I've been hooked ever since, so much so that I did not hesitate to buy the first season... I got so hooked that I took time off from work just to watch this box set, something my boss was teasing me about for days after the fact.
 I cannot discuss the plot for this show, because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing piece for anyone who might be interested, all I want to say is that this box set is well worth the price, as it is significantly less than the average price of an X-Files box set, yet it contains only one less disk, while at the same time containing 24 episodes, each one being an hour long, each hour being an hour of the day, starting at midnight, and ending at midnight the next day. It's intense, gut wrenching, and addicting. I have already made a commitment to buy every new season on DVD as they become available.

I heard many good things about Season One, but never watched a single episode.  I had the chance to catch the season opener for season 2, and have not missed a single one of Season 2.  My girlfriend bought me the Season One set for Christmas.  I sat down on the morning of December 26 and figured to watch an episode or two.  As the episodes progressed, I found I could not possibly stop watching episode after episode.  I finally had to get some sleep at 6 AM the next morning.  I finished the final 3 episodes this evening (Dec 27) and have to tell you to get this DVD set, get some coffee, and have an absolutely intense couple of days watching these.

1523158,5,B00005JLF2,"When I first heard about this show, I wanted to watch it.  But for some reason, I never got the chance to see the show last year.  Now that they released the DVD of season one, I can say that I am sorry I did not see this show when it was running.
Of course, everybody knows the movie(I mean show) is about Jack Bauer, a Counter Terrorist Unit Agent, who is having a horrible day.  The day consists of him trying to prevent an assissination of the soon-to-be president Palmer, and also trying to find his kidnapped family.  Somehow all this is connected.  In addition, there seems to be someone in the agency against him.
This is the greatest tv show I have ever seen!  Every episode was gripping and left me with suspense until the next episode.  It is like reading a great mystery and each chapter provided more clues or twists to keep the reader in suspense until the end.  Now I am watching season two and am taping each episode so I don't miss anything.  I will end up getting that DVD set as well next year.  It literally makes you want to watch to see what happens.  Never has a show make me not want to miss a single episode.  It is exactly as how they described it:  INTENSE!!!!!
With the DVD, you don't have to wait each week for what is going to happen because its all in there in one set.  And this show really felt like a 18 hour movie and the last episode ends the season terrifically!!  This is a must-have for DVD sets!!!",1040515200,,1437,4.212454212454213
1523159,5,B00005JLF2,"I kept hearing about how terrific the new ""24"" television show is so I had to check it out for myself at Blockbuster. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. I wasn't really a big fan of Keifer Sutherland and the whole ""government agent trying to stop potential harm to a presidential candidate"" storyline sounded a little overdone, but I was in shock after I rented the first two volumes of the series. I admit you do have to sit and be patient through the first 15/20 minutes or so of the very first episode (so we can be introduced to the main cast), but then...thats when the action kicks in and the plot thickens. I became an addict to this show as I got to the end of the first show! ""Edge of your seat"" excitement was more than an expression...I really was sitting on the edge! The writing is superb along with the acting and the way the show is presented in ""Real time"" is an innovative approach to tv entertainment. There are alot of plot twists as you sit and go through the episodes and this is far from being a predictable show. Keifer's characters in other projects haven't always been likable but he does a great job portraying the dark hero. I only rented this because I didn't think it would be the type of show I'd watch again, but I'm ready to watch it all over again! If you're trying to watch the episodes on tv now with its 2nd season, you'll probably feel lost. You have to watch the first season first and its better to just wait for repeats or the dvd release of the 2nd season before beginning that. Take a chance on this set.

1523232,5,B00005JLF2,"My strongest memory of watching Season One of ""24"" was at the end of episode 12, where I thought that we had finally arrived at a moment where Jack Bauer could take a deep breath and catch his bearings for a moment.  Of course, I was wrong, because this is a series where things go from bad to worse and well beyond as Jack Bauer experiences ""the worst day of my life.""  Creator Robert Cochran worked brilliantly within the confines of his grand design, where events happen simultaneously and in real time.  The official mission might be heading off an assassination attempt of presidential candidate Senator David Palmer on the day of the California primary, but there is always some pressing task at hand as the hits just keep on coming from start to finish in this show.  ""24"" is a series where the obvious goal was to throw everything at Jack Bauer and the other candidates, including a large number of kitchen sinks, mostly with regards to his family.
I think the casting of Keifer Sutherland as Jack Bauer was strategic, because as the one ""movie star"" in the cast he stands out as larger than life against the rest of the ensemble.  The Sisyphus analogy is not meant to be superficial, because any sense of success at any given moment in the series is transitory at best.  Sutherland's performance holds the series together, but the true star is Cochran and his team of writers.  It is the story that gets you hooked and sweeps you along for the roller coaster ride as the bad things just keep happening.  Watching the show a second time (and in a shorter time span) gave me a better appreciation for how things were set up, which you do not really notice so much the first time through because you have to absorb all the rapid fire developments.  The second season is following the same pattern, and I fear it will be disappointing simply because the ending cannot have the emotional impact of what happens with Season One.  I would be surprised if Jack Bauer and company make it beyond 48 hours, but we shall see.
Finally: One of the ""advantages"" of watching the complete first season of ""24"" on DVD is that you can do it less to start watching it straight through some time (of course, you have to start at midnight).  I am too old to engage in such a dedicated effort, but that is no reason for the rest of your not to give it a try.",1039824000,41,2344,4.453271028037383
1523233,5,B00005JLF2,"After paying no  attention to the first season, i made an effort to watch the second season to see what all the hype was about. After the second episode i ran out and bought the complete first season. This has to be the greatest television event ever written. Each episode is written by a completley different person and if you thought you had a nail-biting problem before, better get out the hydrogen peroxide because all you will be left with is nubs.
As one fellow reviewer so correctly stated, you need to watch about four episodes at a time to really appreciate how great it is. Try to do it all together and you will be hurting as bad as Jack Bauer and his family. My father got into with me, but read the booklet which gives away each episode and even he was still supriesd, so even if you heard about it from a friend and think the shock will be wasted, pay no mind, it is still a thrill-ride multiplied 24 times. My mother, who can never be pleased, has christened 24 her most favorite show EVER.!!
Each disc contains 4 episodes, without commercial interuptions. It is fun to see the clock fade in and out where the commercials would be because the timing is based on individual scenes. Talk about cardiovascular exercise, 24 will keep your heart going the entire time. Imagine a 24 hour movie with an actual story and great acting that will really suprise you. Each character has their own identity and they realistically grow as the day/season goes on.
You will be guessing out loud with your loved one's or by yourself at the suble twist and turns that you will never figure out. Too many suspense shows/movies make it easy for the viewer to figure out. In this show if you figure something out, it is a small piece of an enormous jig-saw puzzle that is very under-rated and worth every measley penny.

1523234,5,B00005JLF2,"There's TV & there's 24. 24 takes action suspense & drama to the next level, it is the next step in the evolution of television. The unique concept behind this brainchild is that the show takes place in real time. During the regular season with commercials of course (during the season the commercials equate to travel time or nonessential portions of the hour). On the DVD you get through an hour in about 40min. The action still takes place in real time with out waiting for all that travel, BONUS! If that was all why bother. What hooks you is the story line. An assassination plot against the first African-American with a real shot of being elected President on the day of the California Presidential Primaries. Just when you thought you knew what was going to happen or who is lying, spying, cheating, or betraying who the story yanks the rug out from under your feet and you stare at the TV with your mouth hanging open mumbling no they did not over and over. Warning don't start watching 24 untill you have some serious time to devote to it because once you start you can not stop. I watched all 6 disks in 3 days (and I have a job and kids). I am a devout fan of 24. It is the only TV show I schedule my life around and once you watch this box set of season one you'll understand why. A Word of Caution if you are planning on giving this as a gift and you havn't seen it who ever you give it to will force you to watch it once they are through!",1039392000,,1453,4.211469534050179
1523235,5,B00005JLF2,"24 is the most engaging television experience ever put on the air. I saw my first episode of 24 in July of 2001. One of my friends worked for a marketing agency and FOX television was one of their major clients. In order to prepare their staff to develop marketing plans for the upcoming FOX television season, employees were asked to screen tapes they were given of the upcoming pilots/season premiers. I watched the tape of the 24 pilot 2  months before it was set to premiere and knew then that it was going to be a smash. Any of you who currently watch the series can imagine how rough those months were considering the anticipation you are left with at the end of each show. 24 is a show you get sucked into. Unfortunately, it is hard to get sucked in mid-season or even mid series as several show elements rely on information acquired from previous episodes. Many loyal viewers such as myself have become slaves to the series, and find it difficult to relate all the background knowledge you pickup from the series to other potential viewers who find this knowledge gap to be an unacceptable hurdle that prevents them from enjoying the series to the same extent and on the levels as you.
This DVD set changes the rules and gives loyal fans and other would-be 24 viewers the chance to enjoy the first season for the first time, or all over again. For those unfamiliar with the show's concept here is a brief description of how this and every other season of 24 works...
...24 episodes are aired each 1 hour long comprising an entire season that will chronicle the happenings of a single 24 hour day - hence the title 24. Everything occurs in real-time as the show follows several different plot lines that cross and converge throughout the day often employing split screen effects to allow the viewer to experience several different events as they happen simultaneously. The plot centers around the day of Federal Agent Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland - who won a Golden Globe for Season 1) as he attempts to foil a terrorist plot to assassinate a Presidential candidate, and the lives of those persons who will eventually cross paths with Bauer's investigation...
...Needless to say this method of storytelling provides gut-wrenching plot twists and perplexing character developments that will have you developing your own conspiracy theories throughout the viewing. Each hour of the series leaves you anticipating the next. This lull in the action otherwise known as, 10:00pm Tuesday Night - 9:00pm the next Tuesday, has now been dealt with for all you new viewers w/ this DVD set.
 I'm not going to waste your time remarking about extra added features, bonus footage, and the alternate ending that though enjoyable, not to mention, intriguing, do not represent the core of this set. The action, suspense, drama, and humility present in 24 represents television at its best. Owning this set is a testament to my love of the series, and my intention on sharing it with those not fortunate enough to have gotten sucked in as early as I was.
 Season 2 began a few weeks back, and I am back to a celebrated Tuesday night tradition. This set is a steal when considering the hours of enjoyment you will have watching it and the seasons of 24 yet to come on FOX. I am by no means an avid TV viewer, as I only watch about 6-10 hours of TV a week (that includes the hour of news I watch each morning), but I make sure that at least 1 hour of that is reserved for 24. Treat yourself to some quality archived television by checking out this DVD set. You will thank me later.
If you still have your doubts, see if you can pick up the first episode of season 1 at your local video store, or a taped copy from one of the millions of viewers. If my words have not motivated you to own this DVD set, those 60 minutes will be all the convincing you will need.",1039392000,2,3847,4.55635838150289
1523236,5,B00005JLF2,"""24"" is _not_ ""like a soap opera"" except in the superficial sense of a story that more-or-less continues from week to week.
The closest analog I can think of is a saga like that of the Monkey King being translated to a series format for Asian television. But I don't think there has been any series ever before envisioned and executed with the tight structure and story line of ""24.""
I made the mistake of renting episodes of the first season (now available at my Blockbuster on DVD). I had seen maybe two and a half of the episodes in the first season when they aired, then gave it up because I didn't want to watch it through to the end without having seen the lead-up. Watching it all at once is like reading a novel that you can't put down. And I realized that that's what this is: a novel, in cinematic form.

The show is most obviously unique in the minute-by-minute gimmick. But the gimmick is itself deceptive -- going minute by minute suggests a naturalistic, ""slice of life"" approach, but in fact the direction and script are tightly stylized. (And because the show keeps cutting between different developments, it's not _really_ minute by minute.) The show is realistic and persuasive, but very highly selective in what it shows and how it shows it, always achieving the maximum effect by minimum means.

This is a complete visual novel -- not a condensed translation of a novel, like a mini-series adaptation. It is a complete novel with individual chapters. No other series has ever done this. Many have elements of continuity, etc., with characters developing over time and various sub-plots developing. But except for two-parters, the individual episodes are almost always self-contained. Not here. That's because the goal is to present a visual novel, not just to cover a 24 hour period with minute-by-minute suspense. ""24"" is also the opposite of soap operas, whose stories never reach any closure.
I also appreciate ""24"" for never thunking you over the head with the effects it is generating. It avoids cliche altogether and always assumes that the viewer will ""get it.""  I think in the first season there was only one misstep, and that was the casting of Dennis Hopper as a bad guy with an accent.

Somebody is going to figure out that the same cinematic-novel approach will work with other kinds of stories, not just something with a time deadline, and then we'll see more of them. Right now I don't think people realize something new has been invented here. A cinematic novel done from scratch. Done perfectly the first time out of the gate.",1039392000,,2562,4.737668161434978

I am incredibly impressed with how this show and concept was carried out and the depth and diversity of the main characters.

The DVD is perfect for this. No more waiting.

I confess that I missed several episodes last year of the series so it was great for me to watch the episodes that I hadn't watched as well as to rewatch the episodes I had.
24 plays out exactly like a good book, ending with a cliffhanger in every single episode leaving you desperate for more! Good thing is, with the first season on DVD you can watch them one after one, not having to wait a whole week like last year when it was on TV.
I know that I watched several episodes one right after the other over and over, making 24 play like a REALLY long movie!
Another great thing about having the first season on DVD is that there are no commercials meaning, where as each episode used to run for a hour, now they only run for about 40 minutes, meaning you can watch more without the annoying advertisements!
Another good thing is that the entire season on DVD is presented in anamophoric widescreen, making it really like a movie!
The ""Special Features"" are a two-minute alternate ending with optional commentary and a one-minute season one introduction by Kiefer Sutherland. My only gripe about this otherwise expertly crafted six-disc set is that it offers no commentarys for each individual episode which is sort of a letdown.
But nevertheless, this is a boxed set that all action lovers should own! The story is spectacular and the design with the real time concept is totally original and works great to the film's advantage! The performances are for the most part, steller, with regard to Dennis Hopper's horribly botched accent in the last 5 episodes. 24 is certainly a day (or season) to remember!

(although not in yearly order, of course)...
I have never been one to laud the criminal law/crime type TV shows, so this was an unexpected thrill for me. This is definitely one of the most intellectually thrilling shows I've ever witnessed on television. I was hooked from the first hour...i think it surpasses all the above shows for many reasons...it has so many plot twists and turns....the split screen imagery shows us more than we can see in one turn...one thing turns out to be another thing entirely, and it leads us on and on, then twists again....i didn't see it on TV, since I missed the first episode, and I'm glad I chose to see it on DVD...it brings the plot into clarity and really is the prime way of seeing the whole twisted story brought into play...
the plot leads you on and on....and this simple pleasure, this leading on, will find dedicated viewers wanting more...and those who may get lost behind will be bewildered....if anything, i give it a massive thumbs up!",1036972800,,1208,4.495454545454545

The quality is far better than any other series I've ever seen on TV, and better than almost any film too.  This series is very engaging, and the dvd format allows you to view it without commercials, and without waiting a week to see the next episode.  Overall, this is incredible entertainment.

When the show aired I was held captive every Tuesday night for an hour, watching the realtime countdown clock tick away the minutes. I couldn't wait until the next installment, and marvelled at how deftly the writers, directors and actors handled something so raw and new. In what is a tired medium, this was a revelation. Let me tell you, the DVD set brings back the ""out of control"" joy I felt watching the original broadcasts- and more. I can study the detail and see just how on the edge the production is- twists and turns of plot are still exciting, and hindsight makes everything that is said and done resonate with doom.",1036540800,2,829,4.684931506849315
1523375,5,B00005JLF2,"Every television series has a dud episode every season. Whenever The X-Files focused on its central alien conspiracy plot, doldrums set in. Whenever The Simpsons made Abe Simpson the lead in an episode, there were more yawns than laughter (thankfully, this only happens maybe once a season). And majority of shows also have had their share of dull episodes that exist only as a filler for an entire season.
But with 24, the case is different. Yes, a subplot that's introduced late in the season is there just for filler and it comes across as rather unlikely, but even at its weakest, 24 is still always thrilling and breakneck paced. Put it this way, this show offers every bit of the same adrenaline rush cinematic actioners such as Speed and Face/Off provided, but improves upon such films because of its great characters, complex script, and director Stephen Hopkins' surprisingly adept eye at mixing high-octane thrills and touching drama.
In case you haven't heard much about 24, the plot revolves around CIA agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland, making a career resurgence) who, specifically, is one of the heads of CTU (counter terrorist unit). He's having a little trouble at home around midnight, when he finds that his somewhat estranged daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), has run off for the night. Before he and his wife, Teri (Leslie Hope), can search for her, he's urgently called to work, as it's believed within the next 24 hours there will be an assasination attempt on Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), a black presidential candidate who stands a good chance at becoming the next leader of the free world.
Plot-wise that's all you really need to know. The joy of the series comes from the unexpected plot twists, the nail-biting situations and the ways Jack Bauer improvises upon these numerous dilemmas. Unlike most thrillers, 24 doesn't cop out; the clever script adds little nuances that'll put a smile on your face (when Bauer is desperate to interview a henchman alone, watch what he does). The central plot holds together amazingly well, and never bogs down in confusion. The final plot twist is a doozy, and while it might be a little puzzling at first, it makes sense after some careful thought.
As stated before, the only time the script really stumbles is in that one subplot, but othewise, this is an unexpectedly well-written thriller that's both intelligent and thought-provoking. There's a lot of attention paid to characters (the villains aren't one-dimensional thugs) and detail, examining the interesting political structure behind a candidacy, as well as the people that make it happen.
24 is directed like a movie, meaning we get very crisp, often brilliant editing and outstanding cameawork. On a technical level, it's hard to fault the show, all the more impressive when you realize the series is in real-time. Such seemingly minor details as traffic lights are not ignored, and these little additions add extra tension, building upon an already unbearably suspenseful storyline. The musical score also adds another layer of suspense, and unlike most TV series, doesn't rely on a repeating theme that gets tiresome and annoying.
As a thriller, 24 delivers an abundance of exciting action sequences. There are shootouts, chases, and nail-biting games of cat-and-mouse that that are set-up magnficently and feature equally satisfying pay-offs. The final episode is perhaps 24's most thrilling segment, featuring an intense gunfight that actually resonates dramatically. There's also an awe-inspiring, heart-pounding game of chicken between two passing cars that possibly represents the series' most compelling confrontation (and believe me, that's saying a lot). These action scenes work not only because of how well-choreographed they are, but because you actually care about the situations and the outcomes.
Unlike most films about assasination attempts, the candidate whose life is at stake is a superbly developed character. As played by Dennis Haysbert in a compelling performance, we actually care about what happens to this man because he's a likeable, flesh-and-blood individual and not just some macguffin that drives the plot forward. A dilemma within this character's own family and campaign adds an intriguing extra dimension that a lesser film or series would have ignored.
But the actor who truly makes the series gel is Kiefer Sutherland. The man has always been an underrated actor, delivering solid performances on a consistent basis. But this his best work to date. As Jack Bauer, Sutherland is riveting, creating a character that works as both a family man and as a tough man of action. With a magnetic presence and dramatic range, this is a wonderful performance that was entirely deserving of the Golden Globe Sutherland received. Leslie Hope, as his wife, adds warmth to the series in a performance that's often touching, and always believable. It's nice to see she's no damsel in distress, either. The rest of the cast is quite good, I especially loved the adding of Dennis Hopper as a villian, but honestly? What's NEW? HE IS The VILLIN (""Speed"")
The season ends on a surprisingly powerful note, as if though the creators made certain conclude the story with a bang and not a whimper. They certainly succeeded. The main story arcs are resolved, but each character has a price to pay. It's in the final scenes you realize 24 has transcended beyond the realm of great entertainment and into the pantheon of genuine masterpiece. Believe me, there's no better show on television today.",1036540800,23,5546,5.129281767955801

** 2/13/2006 UPDATE **

My how things have changed.  That first season was excellent, but subsequent seasons have been very disappointing.  I read that the head writer left after season one.  Perhaps that would explain the downward spiral of this series.  These days, I'm halfway tempted to not watch it at all.",1036368000,,483,4.654761904761905
1523466,5,B00005JLF2,"In a time when 'Survivor' ruled the ratings board, '24' emerged as a truly innovative idea. A real time TV show. An entire day in one season. The idea was critically acclaimed, but so was 'Monster's Ball'. What does that tell you? Each of the six discs has four 48 minutes episodes (the other 12 minutes were taken up by commercials in the original broadcasts) that chronicle Jack Bower as he tries to unravel the truth behind the planned assassination of the first black man with a real shot at the White House. Jack must contend with moles, kidnappings, ransom demands, and even a CTU sniper that blames Jack for the incarceration of his old partner.
I was skeptical at first at the idea. While it was imaginative, it sounded very technically taxing, and most TV writers buckle under that kind of pressure. But the plot kept moving by throwing in twist after twist. The cast was extraordinarily talented, and the speed with which the plot moves makes you anxious to see what's going to happen once something's resolved. All the lies, secrets, illusions, double-agents, and wrong-place-wrong-time scenarios make '24' an indespensable title for espionage libraries.
The last disc, which features a pointless introduction by Keifer Sutherland, contains an alternate ending which is very dissapointing in its feeling (or rather lack thereof). The commentary that went with it summed up my feelings when it said ""I think we sort of sabotaged ourselves [to get the ending we really wanted]."" The original ending is superb, though a little predictable. Oddly, the ending is the only part that you can see coming, when even the most predictable movies can have a totally surprising finale. THat's what this feels like, a movue, not a TV show. Buy this for the story, not the special features. Without a doubt, it's a TV history-maker.",1036281600,,1828,4.919093851132686
1523467,5,B00005JLF2,"Each of the episodes is about 45 minutes long, so it's really an 18-hour action movie giving you 6 hours to sleep, plus there are 20 seconds of credits at the end of each episode giving you time to go to the bathroom or to grab food from the fridge.  As you can tell, I've been totally immersed and addicted to '24' and you will too, especially if you watch it over 24 hours or over a single weekend.  For fans of action especially that with elements of political intrigue and family drama, this is a wet dream come true.
In terms of quality of acting/action, I would give it four stars.  Keifer Sutherland is perfect for the role of director of counter-terrorism who frequently departs from department protocol.  His associates, as well as the first-family-to-be and the terrorists all do a fantastic job.  The plot is filled with all kinds of twists and subplots while managing for the most part to be believable to a CNN-conscious audience.  The subject matter and the themes in the '24' are extremely relevant to our time.
It gets a fifth star because it's such a great value.  Although [it] might seem a bit pricey at first, what you're getting is the equivalent of 12 movies for the price of 2.  And it has replay value beyond watching it in one weekend or lending it to friends.  See it the first time for the suspense, the second time as a mystery to look for clues with the ending in mind, and a third time just to see the action again.  The only reason I did not follow the entire series when it was on TV was because I don't like cliffhanger endings in between episodes, but that's why '24' was made for DVD because then you don't have to wait a week to see what happened next.  You can experience events as Jack experienced them--with a lack of sleep and rest and driven entirely by adrenaline and caffeine.",1036281600,,1819,4.416167664670659

1523473,4,B00005JLF2,"""I promise you,"" has to be the most uttered phrase in this excrutiatingly tense psycodrama. Dripping with implausibility (people leave their cell phones on even as they are sneaking up behind people with guns who want to kill them), it is made compelling by its powerhouse acting, frequent plot twists, and paranoid visions of families challenged by relentless dark forces. I say ""families"" (plural) because this drama cleverly interweaves the destinies of several different families, not just the family of key character Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland), the head of the CIA's Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit. As the series opens Jack and his wife Teri (Leslie Hope) are trying to mend their troubled marriage when their only child, daughter Kimberly, is kidnapped. For this family, the events of the next 24 hours forces them to reestablish their bonds. Another family drama that unfolds is that of Presidential candidate Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). Jack's assignment is to protect the Senator and his family from a known assassination plot. As the day unfolds the Senator slowly comes to realize how little he knows the other members of his seemingly ""picture perfect"" family. And playing off against these two families are the Drazens, the terrorists behind the abductions and assassination attempts...showing, I guess, that villains need love too, and have family bonds as strong as ""good"" people (but I guess if you also watch The Sopranos, you knew that already). And yet another family is apparent in the mix--Jack's family of coworkers down at CTU headquarters. What we have is a complete smorgasbord of dysfunctional families ricocheting through a single day, clashing and combusting occasionally, but mostly proceeding according to their own perverse logic. Everyone's loyalty is questioned at some point, friends become captors and captors friends. But through it all everyone manages to stay in touch through cell phones and satellite technology. ""Patch me through,"" is the second most uttered phrase.
As exciting as the series is, it does have its false moments. I found the frequent I love you's and I'm sorry's a little hard to take. And there's one scene when Senator Palmer manages to break away from his secret security protectors in order to conduct some business. He encounters a couple of vandals in a parking garage, spews a little presidential-timber type jargon at them, and manages to get away without a physical encounter. The scene felt like an out-take from ""Stand and Deliver."" Oh, and there's the de rigueur amnesia scene in which both the onset and recovery are the result of traumatic emotional shocks.
Technology is ubiquitous and glamorous in this story. Gunfire virtually unending. It's tempting to say ""Don't anyalyze this story. Just roll with the punches and enjoy the ride."" But ""24"" has a lot to say about human values, the fragility of the family, the false faces we present to the world to achieve our equally false goals, the myth of individuality, and the myth that we lose our individuality when we join forces with others, and the arbitrary nature of risk and choice. Try watching the ""24"" episodes in quick succession. I promise you, when the ride is over, you'll have plenty to think about.",1035676800,2,3252,5.103189493433396

I can not praise this show enough and the DVD really brings it to life even more. Since the show plays like one long movie having no commercials at all really moves the story along at an even more breakneck pace. Its really exciting. I often imagine this show on HBO with even less restictions on content and an extra 10+ per episode, but even as it is now 24 is something not to miss",1035331200,,740,4.21830985915493
1523506,5,B00005JLF2,"As most people who watch television know, every show out there has a dud episode that simply exists as filler. But with 24, the case is different. Yes, there is a silly subplot introduced late in the season that's obviously there just to take up some time (let's just say it involves amnesia), but even at its weakest, 24 is still capable of providing more of an adrenaline rush than three summer blockbuster actioners combined. Yes, that's how thrilling this series is, and when you factor in the great characters, complex script, and Stephen Hopkins' surprisingly adept eye at mixing high-octane thrills and touching drama, then you've got yourself an innovative, masterful thriller that follows through on its real-time concept with verve and supreme confidence.
For those unfamiliar with 24, the plot revolves around CTU agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). He's having a little trouble at home around midnight, when he finds that his estranged daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), has run off for the night. Before he and his wife, Teri (Leslie Hope), can serach for her, he's urgently called to work; it's believed that within the next 24 hours there will be an assassination attempt on Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), a black presidential candidate who stands a good chance of becoming the next leader of the free world.
Plot-wise, that's all you need to know. The joy of the series comes from the unexpected plot twists and the crescendo in suspense as you wonder how Bauer is going to get himself out of this mess he's in. Yeah, there are some minor plot contrivances here and there, but they're hard to notice, and it's only after some extreme nitpicking you're going to notice a few flaws. The central storyline holds together amazingly well and never bogs down in confusion. The script also adds a lot of little nuances in the plot that'll put a smile on your face (watch what Sutherland does in episode 4 when he's desperate to interview a prisoner).
In concept, 24 probably sounds easy and gimmicky, but in reality, the show must have been ridiculously hard to pull off. Little details such as traffic light can no longer be ignored. Action must immediately pick up from where it last left off and the filmmakers have to juggle several subplots together without forgetting the constraints in time. And somehow, they pull it off. Not for a moment does the series ever lose momentum or drag in pacing. Not for a second did I ever find myself less than completely engrossed by the converging subplots. And I most certainly never contemplated pressing the fast forward button (I watched 24 on DVD).
24 delivers its share of action sequences. There are shootouts, chases, and cat-and-mouse games, which might sound requisite and perfunctory, but all the action here is tightly choreographed and work in service of the story. Thus, the tension is ratcheted up a few notches during some of the gunfights and chases. The final episode is probably the series' most thrilling segment; capping off with a two-fisted gun battle that actually resonates on a dramatic level and then a shootout between two passing cars, a ""money shot"" scene if I ever saw one.

An aspect of assassination plots that's always bugged me is that the guy whose life is in danger is usually nothing more than a macguffin to drive the plot forward. 24, thankfully, doesn't fall into this trap. As played superbly by Dennis Haysbert, Palmer is a fully developed flesh-and-blood individual who's ultimately compelling and likeable. The turmoil developing in his campaign an inriguing dimension to his character that a lesser film or series would have ignored.
Good as Haysbert is, it's Kiefer Sutherland who steals the show. After years of second-rate roles and glorified supporting performances, Sutherland finally gets back on track, showing why he's one of the most underrated actors around. Simply put, he delivers the best performance of his career, creating the perfect balance between tough action hero and everday family man. Leslie Hope is equally as good as his wife, Teri, carrying a Lion's share of the series' emotional baggage and pulling it off without a hitch. It's a pity she didn't get a nomination or two for her terrific work. The rest of the cast is quite good, though Elisha Cuthbert has gotten some criticism here and there. It's not a bad performance, but admittedly, she's least convincing when she shouts.
24 ends on a surprisingly powerful note, a dramatic punch of a final scene that transcends this series from great entertainment to the realm of cinematic masterpiece (okay, no complaining, I realize this is still TV). Just ask yourself if any of the other networks would have had the guts to end it the way they did. Kudos to the series creators and Fox for delivering such a memorable conclusion. The main story arcs are resolved, but everyone has a price to pay. 24 is, without a doubt, the best show on television today and I absolutely cannot wait for season two.",1035244800,8,4979,4.899289099526066
1523507,5,B00005JLF2,"From hearing the first voice-over from Kiefer Sutherland in the pilot, ""The following takes places from 12:00 PM to 1:00 AM on the day of the California Presidential Primary. Events occur in real time,"" I was hooked. And you should be too.

Every episode is incredibly well-crafted. The use of picture-in-picture and widescreen are especially expertly done. A digital clock appears on the screen on occasion, and it ticks before commercial breaks and at the end of every episode. This ticking sound soon becomes haunting and heart-pounding. It is one of the elements that keeps your eyes wide open, your blood pumping, and your breath short. Literally. I have on many occasions had to take a water break during commercials.
The story is incredibly suspenseful. Even those who would never speak to a television would find themselves shouting, ""No!"" ""Oh my god!"" and ""Why?"". Although we know that in the magic realm of television, order will be restored, viewers are frightened for the characters. The writers do an incredible job of building suspense and bring the characters to life, as do the actors.
24 has been blessed with a fantastic cast, which, coincidentally, is mostly Canadian. Kiefer Sutherland obviously stands out as Jack Bauer, the federal agent with incredible love for his cause and his family, but a feverish temper as well. Whenever Jack threatens someone, you know he's serious. And you're afraid. Dennis Haysbert and Penny Johnson Jerald have incredible anti-chemistry as Senator Robert Palmer and his wife Sherry, who have a great deal of friction. In front of the press, they're loving and close, but once they are away from the press, everything is different. They test each other. These are only examples of an incredible and believable cast.
24 should have won all of the television awards it was nominated for. The only major award won so far is Kiefer Sutherland's Best Actor in a Drama Golden Globe, which he deserved far more than any other nominee.
I could not let myself miss an episode of the sublimely insane first season, and as soon as Season Two starts, homework will have to wait. It's that good.

1523511,5,B00005JLF2,"When 24 premiered on Fox in 2001, the hook of the show was that each episode represented one hour in the day of the presidential primary in California.  Each episode opens by telling you the hour that is taking place and that the events are in real time.  This is, of course, is a radical new concept for tv, which usually speeds up time for the sake of a story line.  But a format can only get you so far.  A show must be entertaining to hold your attention and 24 is extremely entertaining.  The show is a literal rollercoaster ride.  Kiefer Sutherland stars as Jack Bauer who works for the Los Angeles based counter terrorism unit of the federal government.  Dennis Haysbert is David Palmer, an African American senator who has a real shot at winning a presidential nomination.  It has been discovered that an extremely credible assassination attempt will be made on his life that day.  Jack is put in charge of finding out who is behind the attempt and to stop it.  He is also advised that the people behind the attempt include dirty agents within the organization.  In addition to all of this his daughter and then wife are kidnapped.  The tension is high as Jack struggles to unearth the plot against Palmer, save his family and even himself.  A clock shows up every now and then (usually where there is a commercial break and then when the show would comeback from the break) to keep you up-to-date on the timing.  The show also breaks the screen down into sections at times, so you can see what's happen to several characters at once in order to keep the show in real time. Each episode picks up where the last one ended, there are no flashbacks or recaps.  There are times when the show does ask you to suspend reality for a bit, but basically it is completely believable.  You do lose some of the cliffhanger feeling of the original run of the series as you don't have to wait a week in between shows, but the DVD retains the exciting, high quality drama, superb acting (especially by Mr. Sutherland) that earned 24 high praise and several Emmy Awards.",1034812800,6,2062,4.502688172043011
1523512,3,B00005JLF2,"Picture quality: 4.5/5
It looks nice and crisp, but isn't perfect.  I noticed that there was a hair or some sort of fiber for the entirety of one camera shot in the first episode.  I'm sure experts could spot more.
Sound: 4/5
The sound is great and really comes out in a nice audio system with subwoofers, but it's merely stereo and wasn't enhanced with 5.1 surround.
Extras: 1/5
I thought the packaging was nice when it first arrived, with an unfolding booklet with a portrait of six of the characters showing through a transparent disc holder.  Then I couldn't close it one day.  The disc holders are fastened down with only rubber glue!  I had to peel it off and restick it down.  I can only hope that it doesn't fall out of place again.  As for extra features, well, there pretty much are none.  I couldn't find the so-called season two teaser trailer as listed on Amazon and the outer packaging, so I'm assuming it's part of Kiefer's season one introduction, where he basically only says that season two will be even better.  What's worse, they put the introduction on the last disc!  Please enjoy season one, now take the last disc out, don't watch the last four hours yet or you'll spoil everything, and then put the first disc in, please.
I won't talk much about the plotlines and the quality of the show.  It's just one of my favorite shows of all time.  I only have one complaint about the actual show, and I'm sure other fans will know.  They should've made someone else the mole at the end.  It just didn't fit with the rest of the show.
The ""previously on 24"" bits that you see between the show logo and the start of the episode aren't in this set.  Even though what happened in the previous episode would be obvious and redundant to a home viewer with a box set, it's still a part of the show.  The recaps were stylishly done as well, keeping you refreshed on who the characters are and what's going on if you're a bit lost.  The worst thing about these parts missing is that sometimes, you notice that the score has already started at the episode beginnings, and seems like the beginning of the score is missing and chopped off.  The composer scored the entirety of what was aired, not just the relevant new footage of the episodes.
For such a great series with its loyal following, it is a travesty that hardly anything was done for this box set release.  I would've liked to see a feature where you can listen to the score by itself.  Cast biographies should be on every DVD release.  Deleted scenes; I've heard that there was more footage to Mandy's scenes involving the airplane.  Outtakes.  Cast and crew interviews.  They could've put just fifteen minutes of extra footage in this set and I wouldn't complain, but they hardly did anything.
My guess is that this DVD set was just a promotional tool to get people, curious about the buzz, into the show and watching the second season.  If the second season goes well, they might release a new first season set with everything we want, except charging at least [money] more than it is now.  If so, I hope they have a rebate for those who bought the original set.
Overall, I guess it is your money's worth.  50 bucks for 24 hours minus commercials is a pretty good deal.  I've paid over a hundred for other sets that are only ten hours minus commercials.  It just could've been done a lot better.",1034726400,4,3363,4.458265139116203
1523513,3,B00005JLF2,"Somewhat torn on how to write this, I will say two things and let you decide. First, there's really good acting (for the most part), the overall storyline is extremely well thought out and some of the scenes are very intense and even shocking. It's addictive as well, especially if you buy the box. So be warned, it will be hard to stop once you've started. The intricacies of collusion, self interests, and sheer ruthlessness of some of these characters will all lend to your entertainment. So you ARE going to get your fill of TV drama.
Remorse? I finally finished and looking back, I'm somewhat dissappointed, it's basically the same show over and over. I'm glad I saw the whole thing, but I feel like they wasted alot of time with peripheral drama. This could've made a great movie (minus the minutia).",1034726400,2,806,4.643356643356643

If they're releasing the entire season on DVD, there's no way I can miss it! Kinda silly of me. 24 is interesting as a TV show, but it is still at its core a garden-variety TV show and nothing but. The narrative gimmick is indeed interesting, but beyond that, the show doesn't take any risks. The acting often becomes... unnecessarily operatic... and the story quickly becomes obsessed with surprising the viewer. He's good! No, he's bad! She's in trouble! No, she's not, because she's badder than he is! After awhile, I just stopped caring.",1034553600,8,680,4.722689075630252

1523576,5,B00005JLF2,"When I first heard about this program during the Summer of 2001, I was eager to check it out, because the concept of an entire season taking place in the course of one day appealed to me.  Because I'm thinking to myself, 'They've must've packed this show with so much in it to sustain this type of thing for one entire day, for certain things to always be happening in each hour.'  When the show finally began its run on Fox, I was glued to my television screen, always checking my watch, and every time the hour ended, I was anxious to know what was going to happen next.  The show was definitely addictive, and Kiefer Sutherland is definitely unbelievable as Jack Bauer.  He definitely deserved that Golden Globe, and since he didn't get the Emmy this year, I hope he gets it next year.  I hope this show continues for at the most 7 years, because basically if you do seven seasons, that's seven days, one whole week basically.

It features heaping mounds of mindless exposition, lots of running around (the purest form of dramatic filler), laughable plot contrivances (Jack's daughter being kidnapped 5 TIMES over the course of ONE DAY, his wife a PREGNANT AMNESIAC), and a villain that is the live-action equivalent of Boris Badenov.
Rent it if you're curious, but trust me...this is not the sort of entertainment that holds up to repeat viewings.  It's virtually all surface flash with no deeper meaning or genuine artistic merit.",1033776000,15,597,5.28421052631579

1523579,5,B00005JLF2,"I've been debating with myself what to grade this.  It is not a perfect piece of drama.  There were some annoying aspects and characters plus predictible plot moments.  However, on balance, the fact that this kept both hubby and me glued to the screen night after night, going through at least 3 episodes at a crack, is very telling on just how big a guilty viewing pleasure this DVD set is.  This is the story of federal agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) who experiences crisis after crisis in one very long day.  The pivotal point is that both Bauer and the African American presidential candidate are at extreme risk on this day in California because of some Serbian terrorists who are out to revenge past wrongs against them.  Their idea of revenge extends to Bauer's wife and daughter as well. Both hubby and I enjoyed the extremely devious wife, Sherri, of David Palmer (presidential candidate) whereas Bauer's wife was such a goody two shoes that she began to grate on our nerves.  Jack's key agent at the bureau is Nina.  He's also had an affair with her and Jack's wife learns of this while Nina is handling her case. Nina is a key character too, one who never looses her cool under fire. There is also a very attractive Serbian terrorist who is having an affair with an aide to the presidential candidate to get information out of her.  She becomes aware of being used and the ensuing scenes between these two, where she knows he's used her, are the very best in the whole set.  Kiefer Sutherland, like many top actors, has a wonderful, memorable voice.  He is marvelous as agent Bauer. Dennis Hopper is the key Serbian villain.  I can't say it was a huge surprise to find him playing this role.  He's ok but I'd rather see him go back to directing.",1033430400,,1762,4.555555555555555

A riveting, complex, terribly satisfying show, 24 nevertheless became frustrating in later episodes when it relied too heavily on amnesia and easily scapegoated villains when it had for so long forced us as viewers to question our own expections, our own sense of security, even our television watching patterns themselves.  But perhaps most disappointing, the show built up a series of interesting, developed female characters only to ultimately have each of them either be manipulative, villainous, whiny, or self-punishing.  The feelings of male triumph at the end of this are really troubling.  Aside from this misogyny, though, the show brilliantly manipulates the entire viewing experience, and for that reason alone I watched every week without fail.  A good example of what compelling television can be like.",1032739200,2,923,5.20945945945946
1523656,5,B00005JLF2,"Yes, it's true.  This show broke me out of the constant grazing mode, and gave me something to look forward to every Tuesday night.  This series, quality is A+, has given me hope, that the usual drivil dripping on us can be eclipsed by such as 24.  It has some contrived moments ... and notice I said moments, not scenes, plots, cutting, etc.  Those moments that make me snort out a ""What was THAT!!"" soon are covered with the sheer power of this series.  I have a new respect for Mr. Sutherland's craft  (When can we work together?). As Jack Bauer, he realizes (I guess it would be ... comes to his senses) his family is number one and he is driven to preserve it, juggling his job, and other responsibilites throughout.  The senator, with an intense moral compass, is welcomed with OPEN arms.  I root for the man to stay true to his course.  Moral strength has become a joke in most series, and this character revives a plethora of virtues that challenges (and is disdained by) his ""entourage.""  Terrific contrast to his wife.
Details are marvellous. You will find that a couple actors are weak, and those are soon removed ... well, there's one left and I hope to see less of that ilk this fall.  Oh my, yes, I am a hardened critic.  And even more amazing is, I do not write this type of review, or comment about anything within the internet venue.

First of all, don't expect a sneak preview of season 2, there isn't one (even though it says on the box that a ""season 2 teaser"" is included.) Secondly, as other reviewers have pointed out, its not even in 5.1 surround sound. There are very few additional features on the discs as well. Fox cheaped out on what could have been a great DVD.

1523658,5,B00005JLF2,"The Sopranos pushed the envelope, but 24 tossed it into the fire.  While The Sopranos has the edge in brains -- complex characterization, moral dilemmas and deep-reaching psychological explorations -- 24 walks all over it in terms of brawn, delivery visceral impact that's often dizzyingly powerful.
The premise of real-time narrative is impressive, yet the writers, directors and producers of the show are smart enough to make every moment count.  The danger of showing a story in real time was that you could get bogged down in mundane details, but the writers have managed to whip up kaleidoscopic scripts that never let up even for a minute.  There's always something interesting going on -- and because of how tightly packed with action this show is, it probably contains enough plot and relationship developments for two seasons of a normal show.
Make no mistake, though -- this show isn't just about a gimmick.  24 aims for the jugular, grounding itself firmly in great emotional connections that keep you interested in the hyperstylized approach of the show.  Kiefer Sutherland, as agent Jack Bauer, makes one of the biggest comebacks in recent memory, reminding us that when he's saddled with a good role, great writing and excellent direction, his brand of simmering, low-key intensity is just fantastic to watch.  Dennis Haysbert is amazing as morally upright presidential candidate David Palmer -- the conscience of the show.  Many other beautiful supporting performances abound -- Sarah Clarke as troubled, intelligent agent Nina Myers; a deliciously smarmy Xander Berkeley as Bauer's difficult and untrustworthy boss; newcomer Elisha Cuthbert as Bauer's daughter Kim, who undergoes a compelling life lesson in responsibility and self-awareness over the course of the season; Karina Arroyave as tech whiz Jamey Farrell.  And I just had to mention Kara Zediker, who plays Sen. Palmer's naive aide Elizabeth Nash.  It's a small part that only appears in two episodes, but her suspenseful, emotionally complicated 'dance' with Misha Collins as a Serbian assassin is simply mind-boggling to watch.
24's production values are exceptional.  With feature-film-worthy cinematography, an extremely aggressive camera (most of which must be either handheld or steadicam), jarringly energetic editing, an amazing score, fine direction both of actors and camera, and sweeping geographical coverage, this is probably the first TV show I've seen that seems capable of truly surpassing the conceits of TV.  The action sequences are excellent, and the lighting is cinema-worthy.
I have but a few gripes.  First, there seems to be a misogynistic leaning to the design of the characters -- a majority of the female characters are either scheming, lying, callous Lady Macbeths or victims designed to be killed off for emotional effect.  The portrayal of Sen. Palmer's family seems to employ several stereotypes about black people, as well.  And then, there are several plot twists that don't seem consistent with the rest of the show.  Of course, when you have as many plot twists as this story, it's a wonder how at least 90 per cent of them work, and work extremely well.  The final twist *is* a little forced, but at least it makes emotional sense, even if it may not make metaphysical sense.
This show is still a tremendous achievement in television.  Indeed, it's heartening just to see the creators of this show take so many risks, even if some of them may not pay off. Just for its gutsy style, narrative conceits and white-knuckle tension, 24 deserves its own page in the annals of TV history.  A milestone.",1032652800,7,3608,5.159519725557462

Kiefer Sutherland plays government agent Jack Bauer who is put in charge of uncovering a plot to assassinate presidential candidate David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) sometime before the day is out.  Unfortunately for Bauer, stopping this plot becomes more complicated when his own family is placed in danger.  There are a lot of nifty little things to like about the show (including it's usage of split screen effects during key sequences, cliffhangers that make you want to see what happens next), and all of it is balanced out by strong performances from the cast, and some really shocking turnabouts that are dripping over with tension.

1523707,5,B00005JLF2,"Most of what has been mentioned here is right on the money. I just want to add two comments:
First, the twist at the end is only ""ludicrous"" if you expect a Hollywood ending. I was shocked at the ending (trying not to give it away), and any OTHER ending would have been a cop-out...
Second, for those of you who have never met someone with instantaneous temporary amnesia, now you have, ME! When I was 16 I was sucker punched by someone in an emotional situation causing me to hit my head on cement, and the result was that I had amnesia instantly for the remainder of the day. I only snapped out of it the next morning when I woke up (which was strange, since it took me a while to realize I didn't remember going to sleep the previous night). Mine actually disabled my short term memory. You could tell me something and I would forget it 5 seconds later. Today I have memory ""flashes"" of the time I had amnesia, but unlike typical Hollywood, the majority of my memory of this time is completely lost to me (and now thats it's been over 30 years since, chances are it never will). By the way, most of my recollections here are based on second hand information from people around me at the time (think about how weird that is to me). I can't imagine how amnesia could ever be something that ""slowly develops"" in an individual. It's not like you remember half a person's name, or drawing a blank first on one hour of one's life, then two, then three. No, in my experience, it's an all or nothing instantaneous infliction. As is the recovery (partial as it is in my case)...
I forget now, what was I saying (not so subtle satire)? Oh yeah.  I was hoping this series was going to be released to DVD, and I got my wish. So many people I know missed this show, and many episodes were never shown twice (in Los Angeles anyway). And, I really couldn't recommend someone start watching it after the first few episodes, now could I? That being said, again not trying to give too much away, there IS a point in the middle where one could jump on board. This is only because it is obvious the producers didn't know if the show would go the full 24 episodes at first and it kind of naturally concludes, tying up most current loose ends, somewhere in the middle. Enough said... :)

Alias is definitely THE show to watch and get hooked on, with neverending, edge-of-your-seat excitement and action.  Plus, the cast, featuring Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber (both nominated for Emmys), is just tremendous, and deftly pulls off storyline after storyline.

At first, I wasn't too big a fan of Kiefer's work, but that changed after watching the first few episodes of this great great show. True, I agree with others when they say that some of the plot twists are out there, and I didn't quite care that much for the ending. However, this set features an alternate ending to the last episode. When this set comes out next week, I'll be at the store with money in hand.",1031616000,,488,4.147368421052631
1523711,5,B00005JLF2,"Fox's brilliant 24 is original, intelligent with edge-of-your-seat knockout suspense and thrilling action sequences--plus brilliant casting. Kiefer Sutherland, in easily the best role of his 17-year career as weary but determined federal agent Jack Bauer, gives a tour-de-force performance.  His Jack Bauer is someone with whom we instantly identify; however, he is nonetheless stronger, more patient, more resilient than are most of us, and certainly goes through what can only be described as a 24-hour personal and political nightmare of the highest order.
Dennis Haysbert plays Senator Palmer, attempting to claim the historical distinction of being the first African-American to become President of the United States, and his performance is both powerful and compelling. The danger he faces on two fronts (the assassination conspiracy & his broken home life) is overwhelming, yet somehow believable, and adds to the sense of immediacy we feel while watching.  The other supporting characters are all well-cast and well-played.
In television history, 24 goes down in TV history with such legendary series as THE FUGITIVE and RICH MAN, POOR MAN.  This will be remembered as a watershed in our time, as well as the diamond in the middle of the usual television network roughage in the year 2002. If you missed the series on TV, then by all means buy the DVD! Trust me on this one. :) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1031270400,6,1404,5.231111111111111

1523713,5,B00005JLF2,"With the possible exception of ""The Sopranos,"" there was no more exciting, compulsively watchable, edge-of-your-seat TV show last season than ""24."" It wasn't just the momentum of the conspiracy plot that kept us watching, but the profusion of deftly sketched, impeccably cast characters. It was a fascinating guessing game to figure out which ones were clean, which ones were dirty, which ones would get killed off that episode, which ones would prove integral to the plot, which ones would disappear and never come back, etc. It will be interesting to see which ones left standing at the end will figure in next year's story! One thing that's certain is that Kiefer Sutherland has the role of a lifetime as Jack Bauer; if Bauer doesn't do for him what Andy Sipowicz did for Dennis Franz or Tony Soprano did for James Gandolfini, there's no justice in Hollywood (and of course there isn't, but occasionally deserving actors DO get recognized). The show had its flaws; one could rightfully complain that Dennis Hopper hammed it up a little too much as Victor Drazen, or that Teri's hysterical amnesia was a little too convenient (though if any character in TV history had a right to hysterical amnesia, it was Teri Bauer!). Nevertheless, the show was so strongly plotted and written in general, and so full of breathtaking surprises, that it deserves to be ranked as one of the classic action-suspense programs of all time.",1030924800,15,1422,4.929166666666666

1523756,4,B00005JLF2,"The show itself is of course magnificent for the most part. Innovative, exciting and very well acted. A landmark in modern TV drama, despite a brief drop -off in quality in some of the late afternoon episodes. The DVD picture quality is wonderfully sharp, and the sound is nicely crisp.
Important to note if you are buying this package having not seen the show before (having heard about it from others but too late to join in watching it on TV) that there are spoilers all over the presentation. the enclosed booklet includes short summaries of every episode and not much else, so don't look at it until you've seen the whole show. Similarly the menus feature clips from the show which is nice to watch if you aren't worried about information being given away, as the clips on the menu for each disc tend to reveal major plot points.
Also, the DVD extras are actually pretty poor. The alternative ending is dull and obviously only shot to keep the true ending secret. The teaser for season 2 comprises only Kiefer Sutherland talking in very vague terms about the general concept of 24, with no real information about the second series.
Worst of all is the fact that the footage on the discs is only the footage that was originally broadcast IN THE US. In the UK the broadcast footage included an extra couple of minutes for each of the episodes 7pm - 12pm. This footage contained scenes that was cut from the US broadcast for adverts, whereas in the UK 24 was shown on the BBC where there are no adverts.
These scenes ranged from nice additions to important points: one cut scene had a major impact on the crucial events in the final episode and another even greatly improved the climactic battle between Jack and the bad guys.
Fox haven't included this footage on the DVD versions in either the UK or the US, meaning that us poor Brits have scenes that we miss and this has led to calls for a recall and replacement with the full footage. For the US viewer, this is actually worse, in that you are never going to see these great scenes. There are no running time issues on DVD, unlike on TV, so why not let those fans willing to pay for the box set have bonus footage integrated into their box sets?
Bizarrely, this doesn't affect the VHS British release of 24, only the DVD, so if you want those extra scenes you'll need a PAL compatible TV and VCR.
Why not drop Fox an email congratulating them on making such a great show and asking for them to include the full footage as was broadcast on the BBC?",1029974400,293,2503,4.455337690631808

It is an utterly brilliant concept, I remember watching a movie some years a go with Johhny Depp (Nick of Time) this I think was one of the first shows I watched that was in Real-Time, didn't think much of that movie.
But with 24 it was totaly different, evey episode has some great plot twister like the time that......... don't worry I won't tell because that will spoil the fun.

An excellent engaging series, hurt on television by the medium: you've got to see every episode and you've got to see them in order, or it won't do much for you!  Even with FX repeating episodes a week later, it was hard to keep up (many episodes were never aired again after their original week).  This is why delivering a DVD of the whole season is perfect, perfect, perfect.  I was so glad to hear that Fox had decided to release this to DVD.
Although the series is slated for a second season this Fall, the first (this set) can easily be viewed as a stand-alone plot-line (no apparent cliff-hangers were left, for instance).  It is also rumored that Fox has some special features planned, such as including an alternate ending (!)  I'd also like to learn more about the changes they made to the first episode (it was filmed before 9/11 but slated to air after, and needed some sensitive touch-ups relating to its terrorists and particularly an incident with an airplane) and hope that these will be detailed on these DVDs as well.
I definitely plan to buy this right away.  The price can't be beat for the scope (24 hours of tv!), the plot, or even the casting.  You should get it too.",1029024000,,1220,4.5181818181818185

I think everyone should see this series, you have to think of it like a very long, long, long (24-hour long) movie. Everything takes place on one single day, from midnight to midnight.  Each episode covers one hour (real time) and that's why there are 24 episodes and that's why the show is called ""24"".

Hopefully he will get an Emmy nod for his brilliant performance.  This character is very complex and he is totally believable as a man who feels unglued as the wall between his ""agent"" life and family life crumbles down.  I like that his marriage is flawed and Terri Bauer gets angry at him for shutting her out so much in the past.  All the characters are so well written that even the bad guys are unique.

Every Monday I would be so excited for the next day, and on Tuesday's I could barely think. I can't wait for the DVD! I am very looking forward to seeing the first half. One of the goals (Well the only one) on my ""TO DO Before I Die"" list is watch the series, from midnight to midnight!! (Unless it's less because of no commercials, or whatever you'll do. Just from midnight to whenever, hehe!) Great series!!",1022371200,,587,4.297297297297297

I'm looking forward to the 2002-2003 season.",1022198400,6,272,5.113636363636363
1523941,5,B00005JLF2,This series is the definition for great action and suspense on television.  I hope that now that every series is being brought to DVD that FOX doesn't waste time putting this one on the format.  It's intelligent and witty and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole 24 episodes.  It's a roller coaster ride with lots of twists.  Just simply incredible.,1022198400,2,356,4.430769230769231
