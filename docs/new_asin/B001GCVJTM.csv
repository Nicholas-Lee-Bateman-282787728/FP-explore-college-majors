My only complaint is why is episode 3 and 4 not available on DVD.  I bought the 3 dvds that were available but would be nice to have the entire series.
Please Amazon look into this!!",1389571200,2,208,4.2
8305000,1,B001GCVJTM,"Well, it is an episode from season 1, but for $20 plus s&H, I (naively, granted) expected I was getting the full season one.  I know...I know...it said in the body of the write up that I was getting ...what, 86 minutes, and It was up to me to see that it was not ""season one""...just an episode from season 1...still I bet I am not the only one to make this mistake...Buyer Beware!!!",1257120000,36,382,4.162162162162162
