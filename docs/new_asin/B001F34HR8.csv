3564072,5,B001F34HR8,"Aunque nunca vi la novela en TV, compr el dvd sin saber mucho de ella y  me gust mucho. La trama, locaciones, vestuario, iluminacin, dilogos, todo estuvo impecable, se nota que le invirtieron muchas ganas a ste proyecto y el resultado fue muy bueno.

Obviamente, al ser editada para dvd, se notan cortes o algunas sub historias que uno descubre/deduce durante la novela, pero an as no son relevantes para la trama principal y no interfieren para nada en sacarle el mayor gusto al dvd.",1244937600,,484,4.682352941176471
3564073,5,B001F34HR8,"I bought the dvd because of William Levy who plays Vasco and so far have not seen the whole dvd but I could see it is a really good story. And it helps to watch someone as gorgeous as William.
Compre este dvd simplemente porque supe que William Levy iso el papel de Vasco y me fascina este actor. No ha visto la novela entera pero parese bien buen auque ""Vasco"" ayuda mucho simplemente por estar en ella.",1244592000,,404,4.1923076923076925

3564075,5,B001F34HR8,"I thought it was great, I had not seen the orginal so the fact that it did not show all the episodes did not bother me as much as others I have purchased and than found a lot of the important scences missing.  But I strongly recommended this telenovela I really enjoyed it and the price was great.  If you are a Fernando Colunga fan you will enjoy this telenovela.",1238544000,,364,4.185714285714286

Recently purchased Destilando Amor and Pasion.  Completed watching Destilando Amor and was getting ready to open and watch Pasion, when I discovered it did not have English subtitle!  What is with Xenon Pictures not including English subtitles?  Surely this had to be a mistake on their part!  I had to return the product for a refund.  If Xenon Pictures releases a version with subtitle, then I will re-purchase.  Until then, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU NEED TO HAVE SUBTITLES to follow the story.  It does not have them!",1231113600,21,786,5.955357142857143
3564077,1,B001F34HR8,"This soap opera is wonderfull, but unfortunatelly the DVD is not a full version. In my opinion, the customers would prefer to pay a little more to have a full version than to buy a DVD and discover lately, that there are completed cut out scenes that are very important to understand the story. It is a pitty. Before watching the DVDs, I was about to buy the other soap operas but I won't do it anymore.",1230163200,10,403,4.246753246753247
3564078,5,B001F34HR8,"Televisa Home Entertainment has gotten much better in releasing thier novelas ALMOST complete. Compared to the first two they released back in 2005, ""AMOR REAL"" and ""ABRAZAME MUY FUERTE,"" ""PASION"" is practically in its original form, including the theme song and the soundtrack! If you did not see PASION during its air on television, then you would not even notice what scenes were cut off. I saw the entire novela from the very first episode to the last during the course of almost five months. I must say that I am very satisfied and impressed. Not suprisingly, it is currently one of the most popular novelas ever produced! Unlike previous ones, PASION includes a lot of battle scenes with pirate ships in exotic locations. Fernando Colunga, the star of PASION delivers a powerful performance, as he always does. His co-star Susana Gonzalez is equally captivating. In fact, all of the actors are very good. PASION has everything anyone could ask for; action, adventure, danger, suspense, drama, and above all, romance. If you like novelas such as theses, you will NOT be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!
PS THIS NOVELA UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES!",1229040000,33,1169,5.062176165803109

3564080,5,B001F34HR8,"I love this soap opera.  I first viewed on Univision not too long ago, I think it was great, costumes, actors, storyline, scenes are very well worked, it was an excellent master piece put together for the viewers by a great spanish producer named Carla Estrada, Monica Miguel and Staff. I  hope this release has not been shrinked too much but if it is, still it will be worth while to have.",1224201600,3,390,4.402777777777778

3564088,2,B001F34HR8,Picture quality is good but it's missing too many episodes. I thought it was gonna have the entire soap novella!!,1398038400,,113,4.7
3564089,5,B001F34HR8,"Excellent period series. Long live the Pirates, arrrggg! The costumes are perfect as well as the weapons and fighting. The quality of acting is also unforgetable. All this adds up to top quality entertainment.",1397779200,,209,5.176470588235294
3564090,5,B001F34HR8,"I just love Fernando Colunga's acting and everything about this period of time, therefore is the perfect combination of both.  I saw the original a long time ago and recently again when it was shown.  It's a pity they could not provide all the scenes, even though the most important scenes were included, if you did not watch the original one, many strings were left dangling.  I recommend it as part of the Colunga's collection.",1396915200,,429,4.693333333333333
3564091,5,B001F34HR8,I love this movie . It has a great story line. Amazing.  If ur looking for love and action. Love it,1395705600,,99,3.7142857142857144

3564093,3,B001F34HR8,"Yes the novela is a really excellent period piece filled with pirates, bits of treachery, action and at the heart romance.  I can't say how many times I have watched it. I watched the novela when it was on air from the the very first episode to the last. At times it made me cry, laugh, anxious, and feel extreme dislike. *( wanted to smack a few people :) *
 While the novela it self is great I can't quite say the same for the DVDs.  They are missing chucks of the story.
*Spoiler* it didn't include the story of the two characters Hemenia and Mario it seem to cut out all of their relationship. And I could go on about little parts that were also cut although I won't.
It would be better if they would put the whole novela like it aired on tv.  I could make do without all the extras they put on in favor of just keeping the full story
Hopefully the will make another copy if they did I would for sure buy it again. This novela is my top favorite",1394841600,2,949,4.0588235294117645
3564094,5,B001F34HR8,"What more could I ask for, plot isn't what I expected and sad that my spanish is so rusty but I love the pirate scenes and I love Fernando!!!! This for me was a break from the Johnny Deep Pirates of the Carribean films, I often need to see real piracy romantic and dashing adventure and lay off the silly comedy.",1389484800,,312,4.131147540983607
3564095,5,B001F34HR8,I had seen one episode on TV but they never aired it again so I found it here and bought it I'm glad I did,1386288000,,106,3.28
3564096,2,B001F34HR8,"I found it complicated, and it has no subtitles.  I live next to a church and they had their chorus practices and sometimes I could not  hear that well, and at times the audio was not he greatest, but if it had subtitles, I would not have missed anything out.  I did not even finish seeing the movie,I got completely lost in the drama.  My favorite actor is Juan Ferrara, but here he looks like another Juan Ferrara that I do not know.  From what I saw, it was rather disappointing.",1383436800,,482,4.252747252747253
3564097,4,B001F34HR8,This soap opera is wonderfull. I strongly recommend buying it and sharing it with others.  Very romantic and moving!!! Buy it.,1376611200,,126,5.0

3564101,5,B001F34HR8,"Pasion es una novela que es muy entretenida,  Como siempre Fernando trabaja muy bien con mucho sentimiento; hay mucho de verdad en esta novela las personas son egoistas y ven su propio provecho, son muy pocas las que son honestas y ayudan al projimo. La musica esta muy bien escogida y es divina, acompana muy bien de acuerdo a cada momento de la novela.  Si eres romantica y te gusta un poco de accion esto es para ti.",1363046400,,419,4.358974358974359
3564102,4,B001F34HR8,"I will say this is one of the better Telenovelas I've watches over the years. The more I watched , the more I was drawn into the storyline.  My only dislike is the fact that it is edited so much.  I would gladly pay more for the entire Telenovela as much of the underlaying plot is cut to shorten Pasin to 13 hours.",1362787200,,315,3.984126984126984
3564103,5,B001F34HR8,"Ya la habia visto cuando la estaban emitiendo y volverla a ver a sido una delicia, hubo escenas que me hubiera gustado que estuvieran pero entiendo que no se pueden poner todas.
Creo que alguien que no la haya visto completa la disfrutara... digo yo, con ese protagonista tan sexy...
Las escenas de amor te estremecen y no son cursis. Tambien hay escenas fuertes que te haran llorar pero tambien reiras. Te enamoraras de todos los personajes hasta de algn malo y odiaras a algunos, lo que demuestras que tan bien actuaron
No me arrepiento de a verla comprado",1354579200,,558,4.646464646464646
3564104,2,B001F34HR8,Disappointed because the Novela is incomplete. Most of the important parts of the story are cut and it is not worth the money. I Love telenovelas and would pay more if the version were complete. Do not recommend the purchase.,1347667200,,225,4.65

3564107,4,B001F34HR8,"El Dvd es Exelente, la Portada, los Discos, el Diseo etc...
El Producto me llego Barbaro.
El Detalle de la Impresion de los Discos esta muy cuidado, tiene la Imagen de los Personajes en cada Dvd, cosa que me agrada mucho, y pienso que deberian hacerlos todos asi, pues son de mayor calidad y no estan expuestos a que se rayen tanto, como otros, que ya me ha pasado varias veces.
En cuanto a la Edicion, esta muy bien hecha, tiene coherencia, se entiende perfectamente sin perder detlles importantes en la Historia.
Contiene Extras muy interesantes, Detras de Camaras, como se hizo la Entrada, Entrevistas y mucho ms...
Una cosa que si hubiera querido es que en el Final, dejaran la Salida Original de ese Capitulo, que se veia a Sara Brightman y Fernando Lima cantando el Tema Pasion, pero en el Dvd no esta, se ve otra Salida con los Creditos Finales.
En cuanto a la Telenovela, me hubiese gustado que Daniela Castro tubiese mas participacion como Villana, si bien hizo un Exelente Papel como Lisabeta, considero que le falto mas fuerza al Personaje.
El Final de Lisabeta estubo Exelente, tal como se merecia pero durante toda la Novela carece de hacer Maldades, despues de todo era una de las Villanas, y hubiese estado muy bueno que tubiera mas protagonismo. Pero esa es una Critica a la Novela, no al Dvd.",1298505600,,1309,4.646551724137931
