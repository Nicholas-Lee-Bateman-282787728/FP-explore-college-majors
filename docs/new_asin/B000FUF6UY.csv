2588616,4,B000FUF6UY,"This was a strange event, and possibly even more controversial than the infamous UFC 3.  But unlike that tournament, this one couldn't have had a better finish.

It all starts with the original Huntington Beach bad boy, David ""Tank"" Abbott, an extremely nasty piece of work who's spent some quality time behind bars.  He obliterates cluless dolt John Matua in the first round, producing the scariest moment in the history of this event (and given what happened at UFC 2, that's saying a lot).  Next up is Paul Varelans against Cal Worsham, a free-swinging slugfest won by Varelans.  Then the eternally enigmagic Patrick Smith comes out to face even more enigmatic Rudyard Moncayo and wastes no time stomping a mudhole in him (another one of those spectacular matches that, like Severn vs. Macias, needs to be seen to be believed).  Finally, Oleg Taktarov, humiliated by Dan Severn in the previous tournament, gets a small measure of redemption by outwrestling surprise runner-up Dave Beneteau.

Then things get ugly.  Varleans, normally a disciplined warrior with a variety of skills, gets absolutely abused by Abbott, then after his defeat, makes a small scene to the boos of the crowd.  Smith has to pull out due to ""stomach cramps"" (later turned out to be a fabrication), opening the door for Anthony Macias...who goes down in 12 seconds to Taktarov, then the fastest UFC match in history (later revealed to be a fix).

From slow-paced to lackluster to dirty.  Could the Superfight and the tournament final turn it around?

Well, they did.  And not only that, they were two of the most memorable fights of the year.  Shamrock, under fire for fighting Gracie to a draw, shows his true talents in an entertaining grappling duel against Dan Severn.  And Abbott gets a cold, hard reality check as Taktarov, despite not being as powerful as Severn, turns out to be extremely hard to beat.  Hampered by the thin air, it truly becomes a struggle for either man to do anything, and it looks like it might go the distance, until...

So, does the strong finish make up for everything that came before?  You be the judge.",1180396800,,2113,4.822222222222222

Casper Events Center

Casper, Wyoming

As the UFC continued to develop, on this night we would see the 2nd UFC Superfight... This time it would be between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn. We were all hoping that it would be more exciting than the Shamrock/Gracie ""superfight"" of UFC 5.

John Mutua v. Tank Abbott:

This time, we have Michael Buffer doing the ring announcements... nice. This fight doesn't last long and it has been seen on highlight reels ever since. This is one of Tank's finest UFC moments. We are given an entertaining few seconds of fighting and we are introduced to a new type of fighter in the UFC...

Cal Worsham v. Paul Varelans:

Worsham, the much smaller combatant, is getting the better of the standing exchanges. The fight is a straight brawl. No technique. Not even any composure. Just fists flying wildly. Someone catches a shot and it ends. I feel the better and more technically sound fighter lost this fight, but that is all a part of mixed martial arts. That's what happens sometimes when you throw a striker in with a slugger.

Rudyard Moncayo v. Pat Smith:

Smith is back again after his losses to Shamrock, Gracie and Kimo (in K-1 competition) to give the UFC another go. He lands an opening rushing front kick to put an exclamation point on his return and basically dominates his opponent. This is another quick one, but it's doubtful that Smith has what it takes to compete with the very best.

Dave Beneteau v. Oleg Taktarov:

Taktarov does what we were all expecting when he takes Beneteau down. Beneteau does the same when he is able to land some decent strikes before being guillotined and taken out.

The semi-finals are looking pretty good at this point...

Tank Abbott v. Paul Varelans:

This should be a good one. Two big fighters who love to strike will go at it. The fight doesn't end up being all that competitive, but it's still very interesting. It ends fairly quickly, as have so many other fights in this UFC event, but we get to see a but of showboatin' from Tank as hopes rise higher for the slugger to win it all.

Pat Smith suffers from stomach cramps and can not continue. I knew the semi-finals wouldn't be as good as I was expecting. They never are, with the multiple-fight format, people just get too beat-up to be competitive in the 2nd or 3rd fight of the night. SO... Anthony Macias steps in as an alternate. He got tossed around and dominated by Severn, but hey, maybe he'll fare better tonight against another world-class fighter.

Anthony Macias v. Oleg Taktarov:

What do you think happened? Over almost as quickly as it begins. Goodbye, Anthony Macias.

The Superfight

Ken Shamrock v. Dan Severn:

This time around, the superfight starts off looking like it might actually evolve into a good fight. A wrestler and a shootfighter stand in the ring battling for a dominant position until someone gets it. Not an amazing fight, but LIGHT YEARS beyond the last superfight in terms of entertainment value. Shamrock/Gracie was a nightmare for the fans, but this one at least gave us something to cheer about.

The Finals

Tank Abbott v. Oleg Taktarov:

This ends up being a much better fight than I was expecting. I figured that if Oleg made it through the first Tank flurry, then he would be able to take a tired Tank out fairly easily with a submission. The fight ends up going on for so long that both fighters become exhausted nearly to the point of losing consciousness. Oleg actually looks dead on the bottom at around 8:00 in with Tank resting in his guard. Tank actually seems to be getting the upper hand by a slight margin for a good portion of the fight. There is one last surge that ends the fight...

The DVD includes an interesting and worthwhile UFC 6 retrospective. Another good piece of UFC history.",1159747200,2,3793,4.618479880774963
2588618,5,B000FUF6UY,"In the early days of MMA, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) would be hosted in many obscure venues in the U.S. Such was the case when Casper , Wyoming would be the site for a meeting of two individuals on top of their respective MMA careers. On one side stood decorated Greco Roman wrestler Dan Severn versus seasoned Shootfighter Ken Shamrock in a battle to determine the first ""Superfight"" champion of the UFC. Along with this battle, the standard 8-man tournament format would bring back a couple of proven veterans along with newcomers eager to make first impressions and more. In the thin air of Casper , Wyoming the stage was set for a UFC ""they"" still talk about.

The 8-man tournament began with a paralyzing barrage and ended with two exhausted men lying on the Octagon gasping for air.

Three veterans who fell short of winning previous tournaments from past UFCs were back to stamp their name in the MMA history books as UFC tourney champions.

Canadian wrestler David Beneteau who was a finalist in UFC 5, was back with his heavy hands to claim what was almost his in the previous UFC. In UFC 5, Beneteau who was entered as an alternate defeated Asbel Cancio in an alternate elimination fight via strikes in only: 21 seconds. Beneteau assumed his night was over, but was called up after Jon Hess pulled out due to injury. As the alternate, he obliterated Todd Medina via strikes on the ground to advance to the finals against Dan Severn. In the finals, Severn was too much for Beneteau as he key-locked the tough Canadian to glory. In UFC 6, he was clearly regarded as one of the favorites to win.

UFC 1 and 2 participant, Pat Smith was back to win the tournament he twice let slip by. In both UFC 1 and 2 he was the hometown fighter with heavy support from the local Denver crowd. In Casper , he had a decent following as well. His only losses in MMA were against respected fighters (Kimo Leopoldo, Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock), so he definitely brought experience to the show. His Achilles heal in all three losses was his inability to defend himself once the match hit the mat. His fighting experience was a key to his aspirations of coming out on top.

Sambo stylist Oleg Taktarov, who participated in UFC 5 too was back to show the world he was capable of winning the tournament. In his first round fight in UFC 5, he defeated a hard striking kempo stylist Ernie Verdicia via neck crank. His ground game was smooth and his set up for the crank was a textbook elevator sweep from the guard. His second round opponent would be none other than the ""Beast"" Dan Severn. He would hold his own against the bigger Severn and actually come close to an arm bar, but the Beast lived up to his nickname by opening cuts on Taktarov's head. With Oleg bleeding terribly, referee John McCarthy had no other choice but to halt the match and award it to Severn . Taktarov had to prove he could defend himself and avoid being cut very bad as he was by Severn .

The newcomers to the UFC were all looking to make an impact and perhaps steal the show.

David ""Tank"" Abbott was billed as an experienced ""Pitfighter"" from Huntington Beach . While his ""discipline"" was in question, his demeanor and size alone appeared to back up his claims. He wore the ""black hat"" with pride and showed no respect to any opponents. His rumored hard hands and power would be put to the test.

The biggest man, poundage-wise, John Matua entered the tournament with the ancient Hawaiian art of bone braking, Kuialua as his discipline. On tape, he appeared very quick for a man weighing in at 400 pounds. His size alone could add an extra advantage.

Rudyard Moncayo claimed to have been a ""Todo Dare"" champion of South America . He was a bit of a mystery, but by a couple of accounts seemed to have a Kenpo background. Coupled with a decent build, his quick strikes could pose problems to any opponent.

Standing an impressive 6'8"" and weighing in at 300 plus pounds, Alaskan native Paul Varelans was properly coined the name ""the Polar Bear"". While his discipline was a question mark (Trap-Fighting), his size alone was his biggest weapon.

Spiritually sound Tae Kwon Do expert Cal Worsham brought a confident demeanor to the UFC 6 Tournament. His dedication to his students and his close ones was the fire that brought him to this point of his career.

The aforementioned Tournament final would last an incredible 17 plus minutes! Two fighters entered quite fresh, but would both succumb to the thin Casper air. After a game battle, the winner was lifted up and strapped on with a nice shiny belt. He was carried out by his teammates showing enthusiasm behind an exhausted face.

With the tournament out of the way, the Super Fight was next. In UFC 5, a similar Super Fight was contested between UFC 1, 2, and 4 Tournament Champion Royce Gracie against Ken Shamrock who had earned glory in Japan as ""King of Pancrase"". Their fight would go the distance including a 5+ minute overtime period. In the end a draw was announced as the verdict to a dejected crowd. Both fighters were asked to headline the main event for UFC 6, but Royce Gracie decided against it. With Ken Shamrock only accepting, the UFC decided to pit him up against UFC 5 Tournament winner Dan Severn. The battle made sense and would pit two fighters that were rated at the top of the MMA world. Their battle would start off cautiously, but a costly error would be enough for the eventual winner to capitalize and become the first UFC Super Fight Champion!",1158537600,4,5509,4.569402228976697

He brought much to this sport in a time when Royce Gracie was beginning to become less and less talked about. Always exciting, both inside of the octagon and outside, Tank was a huge draw.

8126615,4,B000FUF6UY,"After the 30+ minute manly embrace between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie in UFC 5, there were a lot of questions coming into this event.  First, would fans return after the last event caused a widespread coma outbreak?  The UFC attempted to solve this problem by allowing the referee to stand a fight up if two guys are just belly-jousting for too long.  Second, would the UFC continue to succeed with time limits the Gracie family both out?  Finally, why in the world did they continue to let Jim Brown, a man who apparently knows nothing about martial arts, continue to be the commentator?

FIRST ROUND
The biggest story of UFC 6 is Tank Abbott.  Coming from nowhere, he epitomized what every tough guy claimed to be.  He was a throwback of sorts, a rugged glamorization of bar fights and machismo from the likes of James Dean or Steve McQueen.  A manly man.  Hard drinking, hard living, hard punching.  His first opponent, 400lb John Matua, learns of Tank's prowess in less than 18 seconds, as he gets caught with two monstrous right hands that cave in Matua's face, start UFC 6 off with a highlight reel KO, and begin Abbott's mercurial rise.  Regardless of future success, Tank immediately gained fanatic supporters worldwide.
**Cal Worsham and Paul Varelans -  Just plain sloppy, devolving into a Toughman competition.  The bigger guy, Varelans, wins unspectacularly.
**Pat Smith, octagon veteran, which isn't saying much considering the UFC's age at this point, against Rudyard Muncayo.  Muncayo is Spanish for ""gives up his back with little effort.""  No surprise, Smith wins via rear-naked choke.
**Fresh off his disappointing defeat to Dan Severn in UFC 5, Oleg Taktarov makes quick work of Canuck Dave Benneteau, choking him in a guillotine in less than a minute.

SEMIFINALS
**Tank Abbott continues to back up the trash talk as he chews up Paul Varelans and spits him out.  At one point he actually smiles at the crowd before attempting to turn Varelans' face into raw hamburger.  Referee John McCarthy stops the fight mercifully, despite the fact that the obviously concussed Varelans protests by declaring, ""Daniel Larusso is gonna fight!""  The Tank Abbott legend grows.
**Taktarov and Anthony Macias, a substitute who happens to train with Taktarov.  Inspired by the previous fight, and the connection to his opponent, Macias tanks the fight in a performance less believable than James Van Der Beek's accent in Varsity Blues.  This is the only fixed UFC fight I've ever seen.

FINALS
An exciting fight in which both men show their heart, their toughness, and their lack of conditioning, an exhausted Tank Abbott eventually succumbs to the superior skilled Taktarov.  Unfortunately for Tank and his ample beer belly, the term well-rounded is usually in reference to skill, not shape.  Give Tank credit for lasting over 17 minutes, but give more to Taktarov for possessing enough endurance to secure a legitimate guillotine for a legitimate win.

SUPERFIGHT
To be honest, the Super Fight between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn is kind of boring.  Shamrock eventually wins, displaying yet again that a good MMA fighter needs a variety of skills, and wrestling alone will not suffice.  Good win for Shamrock, not a snooze-fest like the previous ""super"" fight, but nonetheless unsatisfying.",1283212800,,3296,5.0220994475138125

The one guy who I thought did good but at the same time I  kept wondering as I did the reviews..Was Pat Smith..who in all his UFC appearances looked good but only lasted one round  or 2 before pulling out due to injurys..I know you can get hurt here in UFC...

8126620,5,B000FUF6UY,"UFC Classics, Vol. 6 heralds the debut of another (albeit debated) legend in MMA/NHB - ""Tank"" Abbott... True MMA stars will always make a splash, having that kind of magic about them.  It was true for ""Tank"", who quickly levels a formidable Islander to a frightening knockout.

""Tank"" Abbott is the reason for many rules that are a part of UFC today and why the cage was made several feet bigger.  He used the cage in a future event to gain a submission by grabbing the fence in a man's guard, then forcing his face into the fence with his head.  He also tried to throw a guy out of the cage and almost did, which was hilarious.  In this DVD, we see why you are not allowed to ""Fishhook"" an opponent in modern times, a rule they implemented in the very following UFC.

The event is chock full of quality early bouts and slugfests.  Worsham/Varlens is great, Oleg/Beneteau is another good one.  UFC I and II star Pat Smith delivers a front kick from hell.  And Shamrock/Severn is a good early fight as well, with shades of where the sport would go with quick submissions.

The final fight of the tournament is outstanding.  You need to watch it.

Though TUF noobs might not appreciate the savage grace of the past, it is necessary for those people to watch this piece of classic gold to truly appreciate how far MMA has come...",1181088000,2,1326,4.433884297520661
