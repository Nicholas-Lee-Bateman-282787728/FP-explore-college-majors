2244435,4,B0007U1YBC,"If you liked the Part I and found it useful, you should by all means get this DVD. All the excellent qualities of Part I, such as clear presentation, pleasant video and sound quality and multi-angle shots, can be found here except there is a lot more. It is jammed and packed with moves and you'll be spending a lot of time mastering them. Congratulations to the makers of this DVD for a job very well done; I don't know how they plan to top this one in their Advanced DVD.

However, there are some caveats that buyers should be aware. For beginners and even intermediate salsa dancers, this DVD may be difficult to swallow without buying the Part I DVD first. A big reason for this is that the style of salsa taught here is rather unique; I would almost say that it is new, except it really isn't new either. I'm tempted to call this a sixth style of salsa; others being LA style, NY style, Cuban style, Cumbria style, and Casino Rueda. The first four (LA, NY, Cuban, Cumbria) are for two people, while Casino Rueda is a synchronized dance where many couples dance together in a circle. Quick and Dirty salsa (which is apparently referred to as Cuban Miami style) is essentially Casino Rueda modified for couples. In fact, this DVD would work fairly well if you are interested in learning Casino Rueda; this video covers a large number of intermediate and advanced Rueda routines (although you do need to make some minor modifications). Thanks in part to this and its companion DVD, the Cuban Miami style is getting increasing attention elsewhere (even if it is just a rumor in many places).

So what does this all mean? Once you and your partner master the lessons in this DVD, you will look fantastic. However, you likely will have difficulty using the lessons here to dance with other people in your area initially. But then again, I also think it could be good to be a trend-setter, don't you think?",1119916800,19,1904,4.548104956268221
2244436,5,B0007U1YBC,"This DVD is an excellent follow up to the first salsa dvd. After learning all the moves and wowing everyone at my local salsa club, I was excited to see that a new video was released! Just in time for summer. And once again with the very mesmerizing instructor Gigi! This DVD has an amazing energy flow that will inspire you to learn more complicated and eye popping moves that will fool people into thinking you spent TONS OF MONEY on your very own salsa instructor. Funny thing is purchasing this Salsa DVD is even better and very affordable for all! Perfecting my moves with Gigi and Pedro will last me a lifetime of salsa club dancing!",1116201600,10,639,4.47008547008547
2244437,5,B0007U1YBC,"The instruction is very clear and compelling -- it builds nicely on  Q&DG to Salsa Part1, and even though the complexity of the intermediate level is much higher, this video has the same easy-gliding feel about it as Part1. You don't have time to get scared, next thing you know, you are already doing the moves you thought were the domain of the pro dancers! And above all, this video gave me the inspiration I needed to work harder than ever, it triggered my ambition!!!",1113091200,6,472,4.552941176470588
2244438,5,B0007U1YBC,"This DVD is awesome. If you are a decent Salsa dancer, this DVD is the resource that you always wanted. It might take you months to master all the moves, but it won't cost you thousands of dollars that you will have to spend otherwise in classes like a few of us has done.  It's packed with hot Cuban moves that will make any good leader drool. The followers love it when you execute the complex and traditional turns on this DVD. My girlfriend had a smile on her face all evening when I clumsily tried the turn ""Beso"" with her. Beso means Kiss.

Highly Recommended.",1112486400,9,566,4.330188679245283
2244439,5,B0007U1YBC,"I am a regular user of this DVD.
To begin with, this DVD is a great transition from Part 1. Just when you begin to get comfortable with the basic steps and want to move ahead, here comes Part 2 with a wealth of new moves, steps, turns and taps. I love the 'tap' and I think it's the best introduction in Part 2. It just adds so much more to every step and turn.

The overall faster pace of this DVD is also appropriate. You don't really want to take that much time over every step, now that you are in the intermediate level!

I find the instructions, moves and steps depicted in a very explicit and vivid style, so much so that even if you just watch the lessons, you seem to remember the steps and the sequences very well. (I guess it's also the multi-angle!).

This salsa DVD part 2 is just so good and I hope the best is yet to come with Part 3!
Digifilm has a way of breaking every other as well as its own record with each new DVD it releases.",1111881600,8,949,4.01058201058201
2244440,5,B0007U1YBC,"As much as the Part I of this extraordinary DIGIFILM  series impressed, this Part II is so fine that it goes beyond just being the excellent way to learn Salsa.  This combination of attractive instructors, easy to understand movement demonstrations, and spicy music is the best of its kind.

But even more impressive than that is the giant leap forward in the three-angle camera work technology this disc represents.  DIGIFIM is in the frontrunners category of maximizing the viability of filmed interaction.  This DVD is so fine that it merits watching it just for the entertainment of the technology.  It is almost like the superb salsa instructions by Gigi and by Pedro Curbelo are the bonus.

If you can't master Salsa with these two (Part I and II) DVDs, well...better look for another entertainment form!  Grady Harp, March 05",1111795200,10,832,4.9352517985611515
2244441,4,B0007U1YBC,"I liked this DVD almost as much as the first one.  The format is the same, except at a much quicker pace, which is fine if you've seen and practiced all the steps on the first dvd.

My only complaint is that in the ""Review with music"" section on this DVD, the steps from this dvd weren't explicitly called, and I'm not sure how many of them were actually reviewed in this section.  Now, don't get me wrong, the dancing in this section is spectacular and looks like a lot of fun, I just wish that it had followed the same format as in the first dvd.  And I think Pedro almost dropped Gigi in one of the moves.",1111276800,4,608,4.084033613445378
2244442,5,B0007U1YBC,"DVD is outstanding follow up to Part I. Just as with Part I, moves are easy to follow and learn. The number of routines are extensive and build upon each other. If you can duplicate the routines, you will be a salsa standout wherever you go!",1110326400,4,241,4.260869565217392
2244443,5,B0007U1YBC,"This dvd is a follow on from the World's top selling salsa dvd of 2004.

This dvd introduces the intermediate techniques of Miami Cuban Salsa dancing.

This dvd starts off straight into the techniques as it is assumed you have brought the first dvd.

This dvd is packed full of moves.

This dvd again uses the three angle view that the first Dirty Salsa dvd used. You can watch the dvd from the front, above, back angles of all the techniques.

The first Dirty Salsa dvd was hailed as a breakthrough in learning dance by dvd in 2004 for this ability.

This second dvd is a great way to learn how to dance Salsa.

It's our first must buy for 2005.

Highly recommended.",1109289600,14,667,4.365853658536586

8051795,5,B0007U1YBC,"... Part 2 is just as amazing. After taking it slow in part 1, part 2 moves at a quicker pace but you'll be surprised how good you've become after practicing all the moves of part 1, you're not a beginner anymore! Gigi also looks even hotter then before in her exiting outfit. So get even better and prepare yourself for part 3, ADVANCED!

Also be prepared to practise on your own, cause this time, Gigi won't guide you through the review with music by yelling out the steps, you're on your own to be as creative as you want.",1173312000,,525,4.25
8051796,5,B0007U1YBC,"This DVD teaches you the kind of Salsa used the most all over the world, when you look at people dancing cuban salsa it looks fantastic and amazingly hard. But with the quick and dirty guides honestly anybody can dance like a professional. Gigi and Pedro are so clear on their steps and take their time with you. It's almost like having private training. Within an hour of part 1 and the same amount of time of part 2, you can impress anybody in your local salsa club. I haven't seen a dvd better then this one yet.",1172793600,,515,4.26530612244898
8051797,2,B0007U1YBC,"I thoroughly enjoy salsa, and enjoy learning from DVD's and tapes.  The title and reviews of this product suggest one will learn great things about this lovely dance.  Unfortunately, it is not clearly stated that this is for salsa rueda, not salon style or club salsa.  Although the moves are nifty and presented in a reasonable fashion, rueda requires the expected step to be called out, somewhat in the latin version of square dancing.  So if you are looking to turn your date around the floor in your own style, leading with non verbal ques, this is not your DVD.",1172448000,,566,4.63
8051798,5,B0007U1YBC,"The very attractive Gigi main instructor and Pedro her coinstructor, continue the teaching series on Miami/Cuban style salsa dance lessons ... building on previous skills learned in DVD 1. Anyone who loves to dance salsa will want to learn more advanced steps and arm holds to enhance their enjoyment of this popular dance. The music and dancing are addictive and anyone enthusiastic about salsa can learn the intermediate dance moves with confidence, providing they have a dance partner who is just as interested. Anyone who loves the heated rhythms and sizzling beats of Cuba and Puerto Rico will want to improve their dancing ... The superb teaching and special features of this DVD will provide hours of pleasure in learning this style of salsa ... at a very reasonable cost. This is the real thing!

Gigi and Pedro's instructions and demonstations on this DVD are very excellent, their enthusiasm and energy are contagious! The steps are not difficult to follow as the multi-angle programming allows one to view the moves from forward, above and from behind. This unique feature provides the extra boost and confidence the student needs to learn the foot work and arm holds properly. The DVD provides many outstanding dance moves that are beautiful to watch and with practice ... practice ... practice ... can be mastered. The DVD allows you to see the steps and arm positions from different views which enhances the learning. Debdoot Das Productions have created an outstanding series of salsa dance lessons ... I live in southwest Florida and this is the hottest most popular dance to hit the Suncoast. It has been around for over 25 years and is enjoying a sensational revival.

8051799,4,B0007U1YBC,"* Teaches a lot of miami style turnpatterns, se below

* The patterns are shown in a straight forward way and are easy to watch and understand

* There are not a lot of details about leading and following or other technique

* The counting of steps is 123 456 with no mentioning of the structure of the music. This could be confusing if you are used to counting 1234 5678 with steps on 123 567. No great disadvantage though - you soon get a hang of this way of counting

* You can't read which turns are on the DVD on the box. This is a disadvantage. Of course you can write out the list from the homepage

* The menu system when using a DVDplayer-remote is a bit complicated. You have to press a lot on the arrows on your remote if you want to select among the different turns. On your computer it is a lot easier

8051800,5,B0007U1YBC,"I would say before buying this DVD make sure that you buy the Beginners Guide. This is the only DVD that I have come across that allow one to view 3 different angles of the dance steps being performed. It is clear, concise and I'm glad that it is not easily available in Europe being a semi-pro salsa instructor myself, I would prefer the competition to stay your side of the Atlantic.

I would say it is the Best Instructional Salsa DVD on the world market.",1138665600,6,458,4.325581395348837
8051801,3,B0007U1YBC,"Of the 10 instructional DVDs I own, I'd have to say this one is a top un-favorite. Admittedly the instructors are cute, and you can see the steps at different angles, but the teaching leaves a lot to be desired. Gigi whizzes through the steps like she'll miss a flight. More than that, there's an overuse and an unnecessary focus on names of steps and names of components of steps. More than the explanation of how the steps are to be done, tips on technique etc, you hear the names of each piece of each step until it seems like all that is needed is for you to know the name--and all else will be known. A few minutes of this and you feel you've got yourself a talking dictionary of cuban dance terms. The emphasis on names is, in the end, quite quite distracting and I found myself putting the DVD away for future refernce rather than attacking the steps with the usual eagerness I have when I get a new DVD.

That said, there are a huge number of steps on this DVD. They're all in a Cuban style--or variant thereof--and seem to have a certain sameness about them. If you dance in a place where they do a lot of LA style salsa, I'm afraid these will be a bit lost. No dramatic moves, no Hollywood style flair, no shines, no dips and falls. Compared with other styles, these steps are not really very challenging. You may be able to see them from many angles, but you don't really need to at all. The components are used again and again as well, so they don't need to be observed that carefully throughout.

There's no dwelling on style and technique on this DVD at all. In fact, the steps are demonstrated (rather than taught) with thumping pounding emphasis and are completely lacking in style and grace or sensuality.

Overall, a good reference for Cuban steps, and smoothly video-graphed, but rather unvarying and distractingly full of names.",1123545600,16,1848,4.461538461538462
