I am  the biggest fan of ricky here in Lima, Peru so believe me ! i'm telling you  the truth!",958348800,4,589,4.078260869565217
1048123,5,6305603723,I got this video during last xmas time. I really think it is a nice small collection of the better ricky songs from vuelve nad from his new one in English. One never got to see the spanish videos if they were in the usa.  so this is an extra special treat.,956966400,,256,3.923076923076923
1048124,5,6305603723,"I thought this video collection wouldn't live up to my expectations, but it surpassed them by far.  This video collection is so great, I love to see Ricky dancing and singing his little heart out.  I also liked to see some  of the hispanic culture they showed from time to time in Puerto Rico.  I'am  trying to learn Spanish right now, so I really enjoyed the Spanish version  of his songs, I would like to see more of his videos to some of my more  favorite songs.  This video collection was superb!",946425600,6,500,4.358695652173913
1048125,5,6305603723,"To all you Ricky fans, this is a must have video.  I bought it just after seeing his concert live in person and I am totally in love with him.  Perdido Sin Ti and Vuelve are extremely well done.  I had never seen those  videos before.  All the videos show how much karma he has!  Buy this one  right now!",944697600,5,304,3.966666666666667
1048126,5,6305603723,"What can I say...I own all of his albums! BUT, it is awesome to SEE the music performed. The content aside, sound & video are top quality. Artistically breathtaking. If you love Ricky Martin, this is the DVD/video  to buy. I love the little ""extras"" that are on the DVD...up close  & personal interview with Ricky! A ""thumbs-up"" on this one.",943920000,3,341,4.573770491803279
1048127,5,6305603723,"This collection will be GREAT for a relatively new fan, but may be a disappointment for someone who was hoping to see some of his older work from previous albums like Vuelve, A Medio Vivir, and Me Amaras.  The  collection has both the English and Spanish versions of ""Livin' La  Vida Loca"" and ""She's All I Ever Had/Bella"", and they are of  course the SAME video with just the different songs -- perhaps they could  have used the space in the collection more efficiently with some of Ricky's  other older videos.
The picture quality on the DVD is excellent, and it  does contain a great ""interview"" with Ricky -- actually it is his  Video Press Kit that was released with the English album this Spring -- and  the videos for ""Vuelve,"" ""La Bomba,"" and  ""Maria"" are fabulous and likely new to a lot of the USA, plus  there is the fabulous Grammy performance which took the USA by storm in  February -- arguably the most significant performance in his career.",943488000,37,956,4.5588235294117645
1048128,5,6305603723,"The picture and sound quality was fantastic. Really a good bargin especially when it is almost impossible to get in the stores here.
I like the mixture of songs that they put on the DVD from both his latest and  previous albums. Although I don't understand a word of Spanish, his Spanish  songs were the ones I liked best from the DVD.
The behind the scenes  feature gave a peek into the  artist as a person. Wished it was more than  just the few minutes that they had.
If you're a fan and love his videos,  I recommend this collection.",943401600,,536,4.31

7891661,3,6305603723,"I purchased this DVD to replace a VHS tape. I forgot that most of the videos are in Spanish and are not that good. The best videos are Livin' LaVida Loca and She's All I Ever Had. Plus, I really also wanted the videos ""Shake your Bon-Bon"" and ""She Bangs"". The Cup of Life from the Grammy's was not as good as I remembered, just ok. I give it a C+. Sorry Ricky, you're still HOT but your DVD's not!!",1276646400,,398,3.9875
7891662,4,6305603723,"Within the last couple of months, Ricky Martin has made the public announcement that he is gay. So, what do we experience when we see and hear The Ricky Martin Video Collection? For one, we see an incredibly talented young man with considerable performance skills in the area of vocals and dance. We also see a well orchestrated entertainment and marketing endeavor to link Latino popular dance and romantic music with US popular music sensibilities. We also see a beautiful fellow who must have had considerable dissonance in his life as he plays the romantic Latino heterosexual male. The videos have English and Spanish versions of ""Livin' La Vida Loca"" and ""She's All I Ever Had/Bella'.
The videos are excellent, well choreographed, well directed, photographically attractive, all showing Ricky Martin at his best. He is an energetic entertainment machine, every camera loves him.  The orchestration is also excellent with excellent musical accompaniment on each song. The videos that used female models selected incredibly beautiful women. The choreography of both Ricky Martin and the other dancers and actors in the videos is top rate. One video, ""Perdido Sin Ti"" is in Spanish, and the narrative thread takes us into a strange world of loss of a supernatural love.  The ballads have a somewhat overly romantic aspect characteristic of Latino sensibilities.
As I watched the videos I was struck by the vast entertainment infrastructure that has been invested in Ricky Martin and for all practical purposes he was the perfect centerpiece of this strategy and undertaking. He has it all; vocal talent, dance ability, charisma with the audience, attractive slim athletic body, and a face that every camera loves. With so much ability, I am curious as to how he will re-invent himself should he decide to remain in the entertainment industry.",1276387200,,1845,5.1466666666666665
7891663,5,6305603723,"This is a very good collection, but it only includes videos from 2 cds, Vuelve(1998) and Ricky Martin(1999). It also includes his 1998 grammy performance of ""The Cup of Life"", and an interview. Most of the songs are in Spanish. Only two are in English (Livin' La Vida Loca, and She's All I Ever Had),and two are in Spanglish (Maria, and The Cup of Life). Since 1999, Ricky has put out two more English Cds and a few more Spanglish songs. I like listening to his Spanish  songs,but as one of his English speaking fans, I would like to see a new video collection for us.",1258070400,,568,4.3584905660377355
7891664,4,6305603723,"Ricky Martin's greatest talent is his effervescent showmanship, which he pours out to his audience with all his heart; I'd like to see a camera set in front of him, and just let him ""do his thing"", without the fancy camera shots, the endless edits, and the plethora of writhing babes that occupy most of the screen time. The video of ""La Vida Loca"" is the worst offender for this, which if you totaled up the time Ricky was on screen, it would probably be a lot less than what the wiggling dames get.

I also prefer him singing Spanish, and luckily we get 6 videos in Spanish in this collection. Total running time is 40 minutes.

The videos are:

""Livin' La Vida Loca"" (English), Ricky's super hit.

""She's All I Ever Had"" (English), this ballad has some nice special effects, with a dramatic, changing sky.

""La Bomba"" (Spanish), this is probably the best track musically, and by far my favorite track in this collection. It's got a terrific rhythm, piano and brass arrangement, and it's Ricky at his very best.

""Perdido Sin Ti"" (Spanish), a ballad with terrific b&w imagery, taken right out of Wim Wenders' film ""Wings of Desire"".

""Livin' La Vida Loca"" (Spanish)

""Vuelve"" (Spanish), filmed in what must be a Frank Lloyd Wright house, the architecture is fabulous, and the beauty of this ballad is that it's 100% Ricky, no babes.

""Maria"" (Spanish), this is a fun, up-beat video, with Ricky looking young and very cute, filmed in what looks like Barcelona.

""Bella"" (Spanish), the Spanish version of ""She's All I Ever Had"".

""The Cup of Life"" (English), Ricky wows them at the Grammys. this is the live performance of the official 1998 World Cup song.",1100563200,27,1656,4.675862068965517
