1550068,5,B00005JOO9,This is a very funny short.  It's done with the tongue in cheek attitude of Desperate Housewives!!  Great Job,1128384000,,109,4.684210526315789

1550070,3,B00005JOO9,"The director wrote that if his short made me laugh, he'd be happy.  Well--I laughed, so good job!  This is well done, but I just can't bring myself to give this film a higher rating--though the ending is funny, the lapses in logic preceeding it (he doesn't recognize someone else's name on the mail, he doesn't recognize any of the furnishings, or the house itsef...) are too great to be forgiven.  Also, this is really more of a clever joke than an actual movie.  Certainly deserves to be in the finalists, but not to win.",1128297600,,523,4.473684210526316
1550071,1,B00005JOO9,Are you kidding me?  When this guy is driving down the street every house on the block looks different.  Is he some sort of special education graduate?  This movie a sad story about a some poor soul with a terrible memory problem or a man with 'special' needs not a comedy - unless it's audience is 'special' as well.,1128297600,,317,4.338983050847458
1550072,4,B00005JOO9,"Okay, I read the sypnosis and I thought, I know what's going to happen next.  Yadda yadda yadda... I've seen this before.  WRONG!

It's so different from what I thought it would be. It's a film that we can all relate to.  We all have that psychological fear that one day our mate will cheat on us and that we'll walk in on them in the action. This film plays on our fear and presents a humoristic twist to this paranoia.

It sure made me laugh and at a $10.00 budget?  I think it's an excellent film.  It causes you to feel the desired emotion with so little film time and so little effort.  I watched it a second time after reading a couple reviews and I found that I could watch it again because I didn't have to committ to a 6:58 time frame like all the other films.",1128297600,7,769,4.08

I also wished that all the houses looked the same. I wished the actor wouldn't have looked up after saying ""junk."" That was ""Actorish of him."" Otherwise good job.

1550227,3,B00005JOO9,"This reminded me of English humor. I liked the set up and punchline. I think the film maker really took the Short Film genre to heart. I didn't think the overall joke was funny in an original way, but amusing none the less.",1130025600,,223,4.209302325581396

1550229,2,B00005JOO9,"I can only rate this is as ""fair"" because it feels like I was robbed of a bigger payoff. This works great as a skit or a joke --- maybe I could see it as a quick segment on a show like Mad TV. But I don't feel like shorter is better for a short ""film"" unless the filmmaker can still somehow explain why this character makes this mistake. Did he have a bad day? Doesn't appear that way. Is this a cookie-cutter neighborhood? According to the establishing shot, obviously not. Is he mentally handicapped? If so, it wouldn't be funny. It was a good start (or ending), but it needs more to become a story instead of a joke. Sorry!",1129939200,2,626,4.181818181818182
1550230,4,B00005JOO9,"This film is far and away the best one of these finalists. I laughed out loud, the cinematography was great, sound design was good, it is a fine example of taking a typical film/narrative pitfall and using the audience's expectations to devise a comedic scenario, and it was only as long as it had to be. This is a GOOD COMEDY (which is a really hard thing to make) and, in my opinion, the only GOOD FILM of the five. Thank god for this film; without it, I don't know how I would have maintained my sanity watching the other films and realizing they are FINALISTS. Thank you Greg, THANK YOU. I didn't give you five stars ONLY because no film is ever perfect, and I think the acting could have been SLIGHTLY better.

Congratulations on making a great film, and beating the competition with a film not even half as long as any of the others.",1129939200,,839,4.343949044585988
1550231,3,B00005JOO9,"This film started out so well, I wonder how much better if might have been if you'd spent $100 instead of only $10. I liked the shot of the car coming home. The scene at the front door was well framed and set up great expectations. So, have a bake sale and embellish this short with the proceeds! Great acting!! Have fun.",1129593600,,321,4.193548387096774
1550232,1,B00005JOO9,"The idea was unrealistic.  The title was deceiving.  An ordinary man would recognize he's not at his house before even exiting his car.  Pretty stupid idea, pretty stupid film.",1129507200,2,176,5.0
1550233,4,B00005JOO9,"This is a very well done film as well. Excellent use of the 1.5 minute time space. Excellent cinamatography and great use of music.

1550337,5,B00005JOO9,"Indeed it made me laugh. It reminded me of a Buster Keaton's film in which something similar happens (The Frozen North, 1922). I have to admit that the impact on this one is much stronger, and besides the off screen spaces give it a peculiar tension. I really liked it. and it really made me laugh.",1129075200,,298,4.339285714285714

1550340,3,B00005JOO9,"Coming Home is a funny one note sort of film that is traditionally reserved for television commericials.  In fact, one could almost hear a Geiko Announcer or Toyota or some kind of car or real estate announcement at the end even though there isn't one.  The director has stated that he looks for simplicity and he got it, but it would have been very interesting if he could have pursued this idea further...  The film invites itself to expansion.  There is something interesting about this man, so oblivious to his -generic- surroundings that one house looks like the next house.  One Bedroom is reminescent of his own bedroom.  He seems just out of touch with modern reality like Tati's Mr. Hulot.  He looks for simpicity in today's supposedly complex world and finds everyone else confused.  But alas, all we have is Coming Home in three minutes...  I laughed, but not as long as I wanted to.",1128988800,,894,4.67948717948718
1550341,5,B00005JOO9,"Haha, amazingly simple, yet funny! When this started all I could think was ""Great, another cliche my-wife-is-cheating-on-me movie""! A classic!",1128988800,,142,6.15
1550342,3,B00005JOO9,"Nice try.....short, too short actually.  I think the creator has fear of flying problems.  Just didn't build me up long enough to create that laugh.  Sort of a premature chuckle problem.  I think they should try again.",1128988800,,218,4.8108108108108105
1550343,3,B00005JOO9,"It's a humourous idea, but I don't find it that funny. I didn't even crack a smile. I like to laugh too, but this just didn't do it for me.",1128988800,,139,3.6666666666666665

1550345,3,B00005JOO9,"I give kudos to the filmmakers here to keeping it brief.  There's nothing worse than a one-minute idea made into a five-minute drag of a film (think of the worst SNL bits you've seen).  Those that have complained that this is too short aren't thinking clearly.  Sure, it could have been longer, but would that make it better?  The filmmakers didn't think so.  With all that said, I can't rate it higher than three stars simply because it didn't do as much for me as some of the other entries.

Some may say, ""Rate it by itself.  Don't compare it to the others in the competition.""  Folks, we rate everything compared to other things we've seen and since we're looking for a winner here, I have to compare them.  I'd love to see another piece from these folks to see what they do with more content.",1128988800,,797,4.404109589041096

Your entry is obviously very funny and I laughed out loud the first time I saw it. Out of all the other films from the first leg of the contest, your project was literally the first one my wife told me she really enjoyed. She called me from her office to say she couldn't wait for me to see it. I/we wish you all the best.

1550442,4,B00005JOO9,"Of the films submitted, this is the best one. Is it revolutionary in the way it approaches an old theme (man comes home from work and finds his wife in bed with another man)? No. But, it IS an undommon twist on this theme. A more ""common"" twist is the man who comes home to find his wife in bed with someone and it turns out to be another woman... or, a small group of people (a cornerstone of the plot line in the recent movie, ""Old School""). I was glad it wasn't something so played out. Perhaps because I was expecting something so common, the resolution at the end of the film had greater positive impact?

There's just enough suspension of disbelief. He glances at the mail and says, ""Junk."" But who looks at the addressee of their mail when leafing through it and the end of their workday? The front door is open so there's no issue of having a key that won't fit, etc. So, if you went back and really broke the story down, although you could justifiably think,""Yeah, right. Like that could ever really happen."" this isn't obvious, so the oversights the main character makes are understandable and the level of suspended disbelief becomes acceptable.

The return to character/premise after the revelation has additional impact as well. It can be dangerous because if it doesn't re-enforce the joke, it would have been a detraction. But, ""Here's your mail"" is relevant to the storyline and cranks up the payoff just a little bit more.

Plus, it's extremely short. Not short simply for the sake of being short, but the movie maker understood the limitations that come with a short film and leveraged this well. Too often, film makers try to force a feature presentation to fit a short film format (every one of the other entrants do just that). The approach should be closer to that of making a glorified television commercial. Expand on that approach, rather than trying to condense a feature film and the chances for success become much greater. Great job of understanding this and making a good ""short film.""",1128729600,,2015,4.638655462184874
1550443,5,B00005JOO9,"Hello everyone!  This is Greg Benson of Mediocre Films (mediocrefilms.com), the writer, producer, director, editor and star of ""Coming Home.""

I want to thank you all for your votes and comments, no matter how positive or negative they may be.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and all thoughts and opinions are welcome here.  As a filmmaker, I find your honesty interesting and helpful.  Obviously, all filmmakers have access to read the comments on their own films, which is a wonderful, rare (and free!) glimpse at a ""test audience"" -- and that's an unexpected bonus in this festival!

I'm thrilled to be a finalist in this festival, and I congratulate all of my fellow finalists.  (I look forward to meeting you the Tribeca Film Festival screening in April, which I have no doubt you will attend!)  Just like the lead character in my new favorite show ""My Name is Earl,"" I believe in good karma, and I enjoyed watching the other films and rating them honestly.  I feel very fortunate that I truly believe my film is, from a filmmaking and storytelling standpoint, the best of the top five.  I hope that the other filmmakers are also enjoying the good spirit of this race, and respect the hard work of their fellow artists with dignity and honesty.

Some of my funniest ideas do in fact come to me in dreams.  The idea of a man finding his wife in bed with his best friend is certainly a well known cliche, and I have no doubt it has been parodied many times before.  But I can rest easy in the knowledge that this particular twist (simply changing whose wife it actually is) did in fact come from my own crazy brain.  Of course, all humor is subjective and I take no offense if you didn't find my film funny.

As for the running time of my film, I believe short films should be only as long as they need to be.  (One of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen was a hilarious 10-second animated piece called ""Bambi Meets Godzilla!"")  It's true that this festival allowed films up to seven minutes in length, but a simple story like mine did not need to claim any extra time.  Besides, like many online viewers I have a very short attention span.  If you visit my website, you'll find that 8 of my current 10 shorts run well under five minutes.

Believe it or not, this short did cost only ten dollars.  I pride myself for making all of my shorts (except one) for under $50.  The only equipment I own is the Mini DV camera (a Panasonic DVX100A).  I found a great D.P. who had his own jib, dolly and lights and was willing to work for free.  We shot the short at my best friend's house, and he and his wife played themselves.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my cast and crew once again: Carl Ratajski (director of photography), Jeremiah Alley (assistant director/grip/gaffer/whatever else), and my on-camera talent David Hussey (who also held the boom mic for my shots) and Tonilyn Hornung (who also supplied food for the crew).  Also special thanks to my amazing wife Kim Evey Benson (for her wonderful and helpful suggestions, including the killer tag line), Allen Barton (the extraordinarily talented pianist), Michael Mayer (who loaned me his boom mic), Mike Rainey (who loaned extra lighting equipment) and Margo Feiden at the Al Hirschfeld Gallery (who allowed a marvelous Hirschfeld print to appear in the film).

Again, congratulations to all of the contest finalists.  We've all worked very hard on our films (yes, even an exhausting one-night shoot) and we should be proud to have our films on view here, and at the upcoming Tribeca Film Festival.  That's a big deal!  Hooray for short films!!!

Thanks again for your time and interest,

This deserves to be on somewhere else like  albino blacksheep or atomfilms not amazon.com. Good but Short, and only one laugh = 3 Stars",1128384000,,295,4.462962962962963
1550772,4,B00005JOO9,This short is either a hit or miss with folks out there.  I liked it.  Good laugh right after getting home from work.  Could add a bit more suspense to it along with more emotion (not way over the top) from the actor.,1128384000,,217,4.0
1550773,1,B00005JOO9,"I know short and sweet sometimes seems the best way to go but this was to short. It played like one of them saturday night live bits. Not alot of style or technique went into this film, but I have to admit it did make me laugh. The film was cute, I'd like to see more from these guys. Congrats on making it this far.

I wish I could remember who wrote it or what it was called so that I could prove it. All I remember is that it appeared in The Big Book of New American Humor,  by William Novak and Moshe Waldoks. I thought it was funny, but it would be a very big coincidence if he dreamed up the exact same joke. I apologize if I'm wrong.",1128384000,,492,3.92

1550777,4,B00005JOO9,"While the premise is rehashed, the delivery is still fresh and funny.  The every-man quality of this piece - that out of habit or job-induced haze one can end up in the wrong house is farcical but plausible and that is what makes it funny.",1128384000,,239,4.311111111111111

7941360,5,B00005JOO9,"This short film, unlike many of the others, truly embraces the caracteristics that a short film must have to thrive. It is bare, simple and extremely funny. I find myself watching all the other short films and realize that the plots are either boring or they are fantastic but to complicated to be a seven minute film. This one and a half minute film has a plot which is neither complex, nor stupid but a blend of strange and humorous making it entertaining and interesting. Despite being short it has wonderful production values which seems to be one of the larger problems for a grand majority of the films. However, I am not insulting anybody's movie; I admire all the contestants and thank them for putting in the work that they did because in some way I took something from every movie. But I truly enjoyed this one in particular!",1131753600,,835,4.573333333333333
7941361,4,B00005JOO9,"I caught this in the original phase of the competition, and it was the only short (besides a quirky little number called ""Murder"") that made me laugh out loud.  This is a terrific idea, executed perfectly, with dead-on facial expressions by the lead actor.  Congratulations, Greg!

Just about the only thing missing: a (tell-tale) shot of the man driving down his street showing a row of identical-looking houses in a row. It's such a common sight, audiences wouldn't think much of it, but then would remember having seen it after the film ends.",1130198400,,454,4.536585365853658

Although I'm not sure how he did not realize he was in the wrong house, it didn't matter because we, the audience, didn't know either.
