523682,4,6302880882,"Sade is ideal to kick back after a day of work and a light dinner. It was my first reason to buy this DVD. Like many of you, I knew a couple of Sade's songs, heard regularly on the radio. One day, my alarm clock radio, tuned in to Today FM, woke me up with the famous ""Sweetest Taboo"". And then, a strange thought came to my mind: ""what does the video look like?"" I wondered.
Generally, my weird morning existential questions vanish after breakfast but not this one. As Sade is definitely a recognised artist, I eventually purchased the DVD of her videos.
Surprise. Big, big surprise.
Two things immediately attract your attention. The colours and the hypnotic effect of the picture. Sade sings about Love and she *shows* it; the power of her videos comes notably from the different palettes used to match the mood of the lyrics:
In ""Never as good as the first time"", black and white represents lost Love. The superb ""Hang on to your love"" is replete with highly contrasted colours to symbolise the tearing of a man between love and game. The desertic tones of ""Feel no pain"" enhance the cruelty of isolation and despair caused by unemployment. Three examples, among many many others.
Peaceful and originality are two other terms that come to my mind. ""Kiss of life"", for instance. The song is like a tender, a sweet lullaby telling the story of an explosive passion. But the voice of Sade remains soft, peaceful precisely. It's there again that the colours suggest the force of this passion. The magnificent blend of purple, dark green, violet and other warm colours, all constantly following the melody, provoke such an intense emotion that you could almost cry of joy!! You're in peace with yourself.
I said originality? Oh, sure. Originality in lyrics, in music, in scenarios.
Sade's lyrics, though frequently related to love, are able to say something deeper than a simple ""I love you, babe"". She masters love in all its complexity: affection for a child (the cute ""Paradise"", shot in South America), masochism (""Is it a crime""), sympathy (""Feel no pain""), uncontrolled passion (""Smooth operator""), tolerance (""No ordinary love"").
How to describe Sade's music? Oh, but you probably know that yourself. She can't be easily classified. She's a genre by herself. Of course, I could tell you, R&B, but I know she refuses this appellation. Whatever her style may be, it is well served by a soft, sometimes murmuring voice but always... loving. That's it! Loving. Even in the sad ""Feel no pain"", where she talks about lay-offs. The song is soooo beautiful and enriched with an unusual structure. I guess you'll never forget her final ""Ohh, did you ever see a man break down?...""
Some videos have a neat scenario. You all remember the hit ""Sweetest taboo"", don't you? Did you know that ""Is it a crime"" is all but its sequel? ""Sweetest taboo"" tells the story of a nascent love. ""Is it a crime"", its brutal ending. The latter involves the same characters but contrasts with the former for tainted with regrets and conjugal violence.
The DVD is quite complete by itself. It compiles all of Sade's videos from ""Your love is king"" (1984) to ""By your side"" (2000). The picture, as I said, is excellent. The sound, PCM Stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1 keeps its promises.
But there's more, much more.
The features include an almost complete discography (the album ""Lovers Rock"" is curiously not quoted, despite the fact that the video of ""By your side"", excerpted from this album, appears in the DVD, but as a bonus, that's true!)
The lyrics can be displayed in their original version (English) but also in French or Spanish.
What else? My God, you are greedy, hehe!
Well, there's a complete and verrry interesting biography of Sade. I learnt a lot of things about her life and her career. No gossip. Just the real but riveting facts that you need to know. Did you know for instance that she was born in Nigeria? That she started to compose songs purely per chance and as a hobby with old school friends?
What I appreciated as well in this DVD, apart from the usual instant access to the songs, is the quality of the navigation: the menu is very well done, which allows you to enjoy the DVD on your player as well as your computer.
Furthermore, the menu appears *immediately*, no useless presentation beforehand. If you really want to see the logo of the publisher (SMV), you have an option for that in the menu but I never use it... oops, it slipped out *blush*
The only caveat I could say is, I didn't like ""Turn my back"". The video, shot in Las Vegas, is nice but I just can't stand the song. Ah, well, I just have to skip it and then, all things considered, fancying 15 videos out of 16, contained in a fine DVD worthy of Sade's talent, why should I complain?
I don't give it 5 stars because it hasn't reached the mighty emotion I felt with the fabulous, splendid, marvellous Fleetwood Mac's ""The Dance"".
That said, these 4 stars are fully deserved. Go ahead and enjoy!",995760000,37,4959,4.655644241733182
523683,5,6302880882,"Is the bomb.  If you wat to see SADE at her very, very, very best get this video you will never be sorry. I just wish they would come out with a CD of the same tunes. I would buy that to.",994204800,4,187,3.4523809523809526
523684,5,6302880882,"LIFE PROMISE PRIDE LOVE reissues the popular videoclips collection by SADE that was originally released in 1993.  On DVD, the viewer now has the option of excellent-sounding, remastered 5.1 sound, plus there are other minor extras (a discography, a biography, chapter access, and an option to display the lyrics on the screen in several  languages as the videoclips play)...plus one major one (the addition of the year 2000 videoclip BY YOUR SIDE).
Several of the oldest videoclips have somewhat dated visual storylines, yet without exception the music itself remains fresh, with Sade Adu's understated yet emotive vocals (and commanding visual presence), plus a jazz-tinged accompiament that to me sounds like an obvious starting point for the so-called ""acid-jazz"" movement that made occasional inroads into popular culture in the 1990s across the world.  Besides the previously-mentioned bonus clip, fifteen hits from Sade's first four albums covering 1984-1993 are presented here.
Sade fans--or anyone looking to return to this memorable music periodically--should be happy with either this video and/or the simultaneously-issued concert DVD (SADE LIVE).  In fact, for those who only want one or two Sade items in their collection (and don't mind not being able to play it on a CD player), I would recommend this DVD over the greatest hits CD that came out a few years ago...whether the television screen is on or off, you've still got a great-sounding audio document of Sade's greatest hits.

523767,5,6302880882,"Sade not only makes beautiful music, she's able to bring them to life in her videos. I usually wouldn't bother getting a dvd of an artist's videos (well maybe Aaliyah or Janet), but Sade is an exception. The videos featured on Life Promise Pride Love (a combination of the titles of Sade's first four albums) fit to a T with the lyrics and are illustrated quite beautifully with various locations and lots of color and style.

Your Love is King opens the set with Sade singing along and a few shots of her bandmates playing their instruments in the background. You can tell Sade wasn't completely comfortable in front of the camera since she's a bit stiff, but gorgeous as always. Smooth Operator spoofs the gangster movies of the 30s and 40s with Sade playing an undercover spy who must seduce a bad guy in order to capture him. Hang on to Your Love tells the tale of a man in a casino who's faced with being a good family man or caving into his gambling addiction. Sade and the guys are featured as well as a few ""shady"" folks in the background.

The black and white colored Never As Good As The First Time finds Sade riding a black stallion across a desert in the middle of nowhere with some shots of old men playing cards, two boys playing a game, and an old woman putting her laundry out on the line in a small village. It might sound boring, but it's far from it. Trust me. The Sweetest Taboo and Is It a Crime go hand in hand. The former has Sade and the band grooving to the music with flashbacks of Ms. Adu spending time with a love interest. Apparently things went wrong between them since the latter video is made up of said love interest reflecting back on the good times as well as what he did to drive her away. He takes a cab to the abandoned building Sade's singing in in order to win her back. Does he succeed? You'll have to watch to find out.

A Mexican village is the setting for Paradise. Sade, sporting simple clothes and a cowboy hat, dances across the village with a little orphan girl late at night. Despite the rumors, the girl is not played by Sade's daughter Ila, who was born 8 years after the filming of the video. Anyway, it's pretty sweet with the village's inhabitants dancing to the song and just having fun. Nothing Can Come Between Us is another B&W video simply featuring Sade and the boys performing the song with backup vocalist Leroy Osbourne busting a move or two towards the end. Sade and the guys get a chance to run around and be silly on the streets of Vegas in Turn My Back on You. Love is Stronger Than Pride is simply stunning with Sade walking along the beach in a gorgeous red dress.

No Ordinary Love depicts Sade as a mermaid who ventures from her underwater home to land where her human lover resides. The image of Sade running through the streets in a wedding gown is memorable and a bit depressing since it's obvious their relationship won't work. In Cherish the Day, Sade plays a guitar and sings on top of a NYC skyscraper, while her bandmates and everyday people vibe below her. Peaceful and inspiring.

Kiss of Life is the best of the Love Deluxe videos imo. There are so many explosive colors while Sade waits for her lover in a Miami hotel room. She sings seductively while under the sheets of the bed and sitting against a rainy window. Love the last few moments of her slow dancing with her man. The last of the B&W videos, Feel No Pain is set in the Arizona desert. Wrapped only in a gauzy sheet, Sade wanders the barren wasteland in confusion and despair. It's an amazing clip.

Last but not least is the special treat: By Your Side. The sets are reminiscent of the fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers, they're so surreal and magical. Sade walks through a magical forest, dances with an older couple in snow, and grooves down a lushly green hill with a white rose in her hand.

There is no video here that I skip. Whether she's singing in an abandoned building, on the beach, or in the desert, Sade remains elegant and a joy to watch. One side note, I would have really liked a ""behind the scenes"" section of the making of at least some of the videos. Just a little something extra. Kick back and enjoy, guys!

523784,5,6302880882,"Sade reached the highest highs in her career with these songs and videos. She and her band accomplished something that other British based or U.K. jazz-pop bands of the 80's didn't (The Style Council, Matt Bianco, Working Weekend, and Animal Life---anyone remember or recall them at all?... probably not). What did they accomplish? Worldwide popularity and a few big smash hits. Sade ;the epitome of cool. Full of suave and sensual sophistication the likes the other top 40 and New Wave acts did not possess at the time. Yet, Sade was not New Wave but rather retro in a sort of 50's or 60's cool cat jazz way tinged with Latin influences. Then, as the years progressed Sade took on a smooth almost soft urban r&b contemporary feel (if that's the appropriate description)...Her current offerings are nowhere near the Diamond Life period or sound...after all, an artist must evolve or change.
Each early video represents a time when music videos were shot in the film format vein with story lines coinciding with the lyrics of the song. No computer graphics or bling-bling, just good ole fashioned cinematography steeped in rich sepia tones, black and white or full film like color quality...Subject matters deal with, well, what else, ups and downs of the powerful human emotion of love. I will not dissect each video here but only say that the viewer can see the different directions or ""evolving"" venues used throughout the years by different directors that capture the beautiful essence of Sade both musically and visually ! ...
Add this to your musical dvd collection and reminisce or discover !",1075852800,7,1598,4.9222222222222225
523785,4,6302880882,"Aside from absolutely loving this music, I am always enthralled when I watch Sade sing:  her look, her voice, her moves ... all so enchanting.  I'd be inclined to give this DVD a 5-star rating, but I can't since I've already seen the ""Sade Live"" disc, which I consider to be virtual perfection in a musical performance DVD.  Overall, ""Life Promise Pride Love"" rates a ""5"" for music and sound quality, and a ""3"" for the videos.
THE MUSIC.  Timeless and still moving.  I dig the songs more now than when they first hit the airwaves back in the 80's and 90's.  There's a good balance of hits representing the first four albums:  three each from ""Diamond Life"" and ""Promise,"" and four each from ""Stronger Than Pride"" and ""Love Deluxe.""  There's also a bonus hit, ""By Your Side,"" from the most recent album ""Lovers Rock.""  As Sade fans can well understand, it's hard to tire of this alluring music, especially in 5.1 (fantastic!).
THE VIDEOS.  While this compilation makes a great addition to anyone's musical DVD library, I have to admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by the outdated storylines and mediocre production quality in several of the videos.  No surprise really:  the first ten tracks are vintage 80's productions, with the most common settings being bars, nightclubs and casinos, occasionally frequented by a cast of underworld characters or other mystery men (whatever).  As far as I can tell, the videos are ordered chronologically, and both the production value and creativity improve as you keep watching.  Most are in color, but the four b/w videos are especially noteworthy for their artistry:  ""Never as Good as the First Time,"" ""Nothing Can Come Between Us,"" ""Cherish the Day,"" and ""Feel No Pain.""  Directors Sophie Muller and Brian Ward chalk up the most video credits with five and four, respectively.
DVD FEATURES.  Nothing extravagant, consisting simply of a discography, biography, and a couple options involving the displaying of lyrics.
All things considered, this would be a worthwhile purchase for just about anyone.",1028073600,10,2041,4.955882352941177

523787,5,6302880882,"1st Off Big thanks To"" jazzbrat from SoCal, USA "" Read his review its first rate.

 I was undecided for the longest on buying this DVD of Sade Video's. As I only remember seeing a few of them back in the mid 80's.  I'd given up on watching MTV and VH1 to see any of Sade songs a long time ago, All THEY do is recycle the same Singers who have little or NO talent BUT, Look good on screen, You Know the ones I'm talking about.

  But I was very Surprised by the Videos Sade had done since Her 1st album, If you Compare them to other artist's music  videos, she'd win an Grammy for Class Act. The Sound & Video Quality is excellent and mixed well for the 5.1 Dolby crowd.  You will also love the lyrics placed in small lettering so as not to detract you,, That are Timed with her singing. A great idea for as much as I love, her music there were one or two words in her songs, that I had no idea what she said.
  Don't pass this DVD by,, It also has a Bonus video from her New Lover's live album, 'By Your Side' song. The bonus section also has a Biography",1013212800,17,1054,3.9526066350710902

7832328,5,6302880882,Sade's best music videos are on this DVD. While they look ok the sound on each video is the best i have heard them. Only am able to hear the Stereo PCM version since have yet to re-hang my surround speakers in my room. The picture quality leaves a little to be desired since they used straight masters of each video converted to digital which have a little dust and lack detail. The music videos could have been remastered for better picture quality. Either way this collection of videos will make any level Sade fan happy they purchased this disc.,1461283200,2,548,4.49
