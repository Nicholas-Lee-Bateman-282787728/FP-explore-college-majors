Cult superstar David Constantino was supposed to be in this but does not appear in the movie at all. On his IMDB it lists him being in a vampire movie from 2009 from same team so I figured this was the same. It's not. If your looking for Dave action go elsewhere",1465171200,,281,4.222222222222222

On the contrary, since they obviously had no real money for sets they did a good job with filming in outside existing locations. Also the make up and special effects were believable enough.

Orlock (Dracula) starts out as the classic younger romantic version of Dracula. But while on his way to England he transforms to an old, bald, pointy-eared, rat-like vampire paying tribute to the original Nosferatu. This is similar to the transformation of Dracula in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" only in reverse. The only problem its never explained why he transforms.

The actor who played Orlock was too young for the role and his gritty, cliche evil guy voice was so over the top it was almost laughable. With tribal tattoos and a goatee soul-patch, his look was much too contemporary. He seemed more like some goth kid they pulled out of a high school drama class rather than a Vampire in the 19th century.

Then there is the actor who played Reinfield, who has to be taught the virtues of a subtle performance. Every line is so over acted and the voice he puts on is ridiculous. Although he may be doing an homage to the over acting from the original silent Nosferatu. Actors in silent films over acted all the time to help express emotion with out actually speaking. But considering he's the only one acting this way in the movie it just doesn't fit. Most of the other actors were pretty stale and emotionless. Seems they were all either trying too hard or not hard enough.

Also not to be mean, but the girl who played Mina was not attractive enough. The brides and Lucy were much better looking. Again I say this not to be cruel but we are suppose to believe that Orlock is so enamored with Mina'a beauty that he travels all that way from Transylvania to England for her. She should be the most attractive woman in the movie, where as here shes the least.

I didn't buy this movie I watched it on youtube. At $19.99 its far too over priced for what it is. If you want a remake of Nosferatu buy the 1979 Werner Herzog version.",1317945600,2,2192,4.525252525252525
8363093,3,B002C4JUMQ,"This new remake of FW Murnau's silent classic would be worth watching but doesn't match up to the original. Based on Bram Stoker's novel,this movie has scenes that are absent from the silent original and stays true to the novel. The only problem is,it contains scenery extracted from the silent version and fails to feature new scenery that most movies based on Stoker's novel contain. Not bad,but you might as well stick to the silent version.",1274400000,,444,4.855263157894737
