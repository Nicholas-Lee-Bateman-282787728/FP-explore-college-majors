7854863,5,6303908969,"I was a HUGE fan of Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders when I was younger and saw it on television, and I was terribly disappointed when it went off the air.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore!  Jewel Riders is a colorful world of friendship, love, and adventure, with very little violence and ""suggestive"" themes like most of today's cartoons have.  The main characters are wonderful role models, and the show promotes love and friendship and believe in magic despite all odds.

I think this is the weakest volume of the few episodes they released on video, but it's still good.  First, the Jewel Riders enter the snowy mountains of Wizard's Peak, where they face strange powers and freezing ice.  Chaos breaks loose when Kale's dweasels free a genie from a locked box in an old wizard's hideout!

Then, Princess Gwenevere and her winged unicorn Sunstar try to master their flying as well as the powers of the Sun Stone while searching for the very first of the seven Crown Jewels in the Northfields.  The absense of these seven jewels cause chaos such as dancing dweazels, singing trees, and a dance floor in the middle of the sky!",1122249600,,1147,4.6716417910447765
