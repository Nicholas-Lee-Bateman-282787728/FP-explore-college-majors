2510054,5,B000E8QVBK,"This is simply good family fun.  My aunt, was one of the child instrumentalists (bassoon) in the movie.  She is now 88 years old.  My family (children and grandchildren) were amazed at the humor and action scenes and loved the complete story.  My elementary school general music students are amazed at the piano quartet and duet.
We could use more of this style, just silly fun - not so heavy on the sex scenes, in our movie going society.  Thanks to Amazon for connecting me to the source so I could purchase the DVD.",1299110400,,518,4.468085106382978
2510055,2,B000E8QVBK,"""The Big Store""  and ""Go West"" were supposed to be the last films for the Three Marx Brothers, after a tremendous career and a half dozen film classics that remain funny even today - ""Cocoanuts"" (1929), ""Animal Crackers"" (1930), ""Duck Soup"" (1933), ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), and ""A Day at the Races"" (1937). By the end of the 30s, Irving Thalberg was dead, the Marx Brothers films were getting repetitious and their contract with MGM was running out, and the great comedy team of Abbott and Costello were churning out the comedy hits with ""Night in the Tropics"" (1940), ""Buck Privates"" (1941), and ""Hold That Ghost"" (1941).  In April 1941 Groucho told the LA Herald - ""Our stuff is simply growing stale. So are we.""

Unfortunately, ""Go West"" and particularly ""The Big Store"" continued their decline, and they were  so bad the boys decided to make a few more films to try to go out on top. The gambling debts owed by Chico were another reason to continue making films. In any event, they made two more films - ""A Night in Casablanca"" (1946) and ""Love Happy"" (1949) and thank goodness for that - ""Casablanca"" was up to the standard they set in earlier films and ""Love Happy"" gave Marilyn Monroe one of her first screen appearances.

That being said, we have in this duo some of the worst of the Marx Brothers films. Now a bad Marx Brothers film is not necessarily a bad film, but you get the point.

""Go West"" is the worst of the pair. It has a lot of ""bit pieces"" that don't really fit into anything else, and are staged like burlesque acts. Of course some of the one liners are funny and there is a good bit at the end when the boys dismantle a train to provide fuel to keep it going. And there is a funny scene where Harpo faces Robert Barratt in a gun fight. But otherwise the musical numbers are forgettable, as is most of the film.

 ""The Big Store"" pairs the 3 brothers with long-time comic foil Margaret Dumont as well as Douglas Dumbrille. This was Dumont's last film with the boys, although she would continue to make films right up until her death in 1965, and even showed up in an Abbott and Costello film, ""The Little Giant"" (1946) thanks to the influence of director William Seiter who had directed the boys in ""Room Service"" (1938). Dumont was a terrific actress, one of the best straight men ever to grace the silver screen, but her performance in ""The Big Store"" is only mediocre. One of the problems is her early acceptance of Groucho's advances. In her other films, it takes a lot of effort for Groucho to woo her. In this film, she is entranced from early on, thus reducing the comic tension as Groucho tries and tries again.

The production numbers, like the comedy, are mediocre. Groucho said that ""Tenement Symphony"" was the worst number he'd ever seen. A bee bop number in an elevator (the lead up to Groucho's ""Sing While You Sell"") is completely out of place. Tony Martin's solo work is good, as you'd expect from a recording artist with several top 10 recordings.

Should you see these films? If you're a Marx Brothers fan, you probably should. But it's their early work that is truly great.",1294012800,,3121,4.498233215547703
2510056,3,B000E8QVBK,"These films are only Ok but if you are a Marx Brothers fan, they are essential to own.  The brothers are still full of antics and craziness, but the films seem underproduced and not as momentous as they used to.  MGM generally tended to treat comedies as B level pictures and  after Irving Thalberg's death, the Marxes were not accepted as A level stars.",1252195200,2,354,4.5
2510057,4,B000E8QVBK,"""Go West"" is your typical Marx Bros masterpiece. For the life of me, I can't understand why it's so despised. Plenty of wonderful verbal comedy from Groucho while Harpo and Chico are great with their unique brand of physical and nonsensical dialogue. The plot moves quick and the terrible MGM romantic subplot isn't so terrible. 8/10

""Room Service"" is another story. Very bland and family-friendly. The Bros' comedy is not very inspired here, but the weird setting is fascinating and makes for great ephemera. Watch this when there's nothing else on. 5/10",1250121600,3,556,5.043478260869565
2510058,3,B000E8QVBK,"Despite not having a reputation as one of the better Marx Brothers films, I still found ""Go West"" to be a typical MB movie with crazy scenes and a few songs. No, it may not have been as funny as their better-known films of the 1930s, but I didn't think it much below them, either.

It's not as totally outrageous as the boys' earlier stuff but it also has fewer stupid stuff, too. Make no mistake: it has its share of genuinely funny material, both in dialog and in sight gags. The finale is a wild chase scene on a train that is very, very entertaining. That holds true for a wild stagecoach ride earlier in the picture. Once again, Chico comes up with the funniest lines.

THE BIG STORE  -  The final 15 minutes ""saved this film,"" as most of it is not up to MB standards. I guess by the 1940s, the boys were in a decline, for various reasons. The jokes in here - and the songs - are too dated and, frankly, appealing.  However, I personally enjoyed the hectic last 15 minutes with a chase through a department store. That was classic slapstick material and it still works.

OVERALL -  For $13.49 (current price), it's a good deal, even if only one of the movies is good.",1243382400,2,1172,4.276018099547511
2510059,4,B000E8QVBK,"Go West- I'm glad I watched 'A Night at the Opera' because that caused me to want to watch more Marx Brothers movies! Groucho is my favorite, because he's always hilarious in a stressful situation! Groucho plays an embezzler named S. Quentin Quale, who tries to rip off Joseph and Rusty Panello at the train station. Later, they all work together and stop a greedy rich man from building a town on an old man's land. The Marx Brothers help get the deed back and stop the bad guy. I love the awesome show-down on the train and how they tear up the entire framework for more firewood. If you love classic comedy, and The Marx Brothers, you'll love GO WEST!!!

The Big Store- The Marx Brothers get better everytime I see them! Groucho plays out-of-work Detective Wolf J. Flywheel who has been hired to go to The Phelps Department Store and protect Tommy Rogers from being killed. Wolf gets help from Wacky and Ravelli. I thought it was awesome toward the end when they all go through the store on roller skates, trying to stop a bad guy from getting evidence that shows he's tring to kill Tommy. If you love classic comedy, and the Marx Brothers, you'll love THE BIG STORE!!!",1223596800,4,1172,4.502347417840376
2510060,3,B000E8QVBK,"This DVD offers two of the later films by The Marx Brothers; they're not the very best movies but that is because L. B. Mayer at MGM Studios simply didn't like them. The brothers got lesser quality scripts as a result. Sigh.

Go West was surprisingly funny; I expected a much slower plot bogged down with corny songs. Yes, there are a couple of brief musical numbers but make no mistake about it: There are plenty of gags in the flick that are sure to make you laugh!

The action starts at a train station when S. Quentin Quale (Groucho Marx) is trying to raise a little money to go west to seek his fortune. There's a very funny routine Quale does with Joe Panello (Chico Marx) and his brother Rusty (Harpo Marx); and somehow all three manage to eventually go west. By a chance meeting Joe and Rusty loan an old man some money and as ""security"" for the loan they get a deed to Dead Man's Gulch. What none of the men realize yet is that Dead Man's Gulch is actually precious land because it is wanted by a wealthy railroad company. The railroad wants Dead Man's Gulch at almost any price to make a huge, profitable rail line from New York all the way out west.

Quale soon hitches a ride further west on the very same stage coach that Joe and Rusty are on; and from here on in the plot becomes even more hilarious. Quale, Joe and Rusty wind up in the town where the railroad company wants to buy the deed to Dead Man's Gulch; and look for some zany plot twists as the deed passes back and forth amongst several men.

There's a weak subplot about two younger people from feuding families falling in love--if the railroad deal can go through; and the scenes with some Native Americans are embarrassingly dated. Ouch!

Will Dead Man's Gulch finally be safely in the hands of people who want to build a railroad and do good deeds--or will the crooks 'Red' Baxter (Robert Barrat) and Beecher (Walter Woolf King) beat them to and milk the railroad company for way more than the land is worth? Will the young couple marry? How will Quale, Joe and Rusty get the deed back to New York? No spoilers here folks; but the train ride near the end of the movie is an elaborate and wonderful climax that lasts a good fifteen minutes or so. You'll love it!

As for The Big Store, this again is not the best Marx Brothers movie although Marx Brothers fans will want this in their collection. The plot moves along but is often interrupted by musical numbers; and one or two numbers are tiresome. The acting is convincing and Margaret Dumont plays the straight role for Groucho's one-liners.

The action begins when Phelps Department Store mogul leaves half the store to his younger relative, Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin). Unbeknownst to Tommy, people are planning to do him in and get total control of the store. Douglass Dumbrille does an excellent job playing department store executive Mr. Grover who keeps trying unsuccessfully to have Tommy murdered; and Grover's plans to court Martha Phelps (Margaret Dumont) are another scam to get his hands on her half of the store and then bump her off, too!

Martha Phelps suspects trouble is afoot and she hires Wolf J. Flywheel (Groucho Marx), a loser detective if there ever was one, to track events in the store. Although Grover and his cronies are against it, Martha Phelps wins and Wolf J. Flywheel is on the case.

Look for some funny scenes between Wolf J. Flywheel and Martha Phelps; Margaret Dumont and Groucho Marx have many of the best lines in the film as he pursues her romantically. It's too bad that this was the last pairing of Dumont with Groucho Marx and his brothers. In addition, Harpo is paired with Groucho for the first and only time while Chico plays a guy simply named Ravelli who also wants to protect Tommy Rogers.

Virginia O'Brien's ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"" is too unnatural even if it was meant for her to deliver it with an expressionless face. ""Tenement Symphony"" is good but wedged into a film that it doesn't belong to but Harpo's playing of the harp is always welcome.

In short, these two mediocre Marx Brothers films are good for some entertainment--but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to see these two films unless I was a diehard Marx Brothers fan.",1198540800,3,4209,4.517739816031537
2510061,3,B000E8QVBK,"There are Marx Brothers Classics out there and Go West isn't one of them, although longtime afficionados who must have read negative reviews of their latter films somewhere along the way, might be very surprised at the number of clever, successful gags, and energetic performances by the comedy legends.
The somewhat complicated plot (feature comedies in the '40s were big on plots with bad guys and young lovers who are threatened by them and seek the aide of the starring comedy team) involving the search for gold, land deeds, corrupt sheriffs, and a few other things, actually involves the stars (they're not used as ""comic relief"", a typical device of the times).
The problem is that the good stuff sometimes over-milked, for example, the climactic scene of the Marxs' attempt to keep the train chugging by breaking up the train into little pieces and tossing them into the engine, needed a strong comedy director and editor to keep it from getting tiresome.
There's an entertaining musical number near the end of the film in which Groucho sings and plays guitar - always fun for the fans. Unlike the scene in ""Horse Feathers"" in which Groucho sings and plays for Thelma Todd, unfortunately the booming baritone of John Carroll is also heard, along with Chico, and a great chance is lost. Okay, Carroll is the handsome co-lead (?) but the credits list GM first, and let's assume that most fans paid to watch Mr. Marx. [Speaking of production numbers, in the 1947 ""Copacabana"" with Groucho, at center stage he performs a number originally written for Go West!].
Of course, there are depressing aspects to this film, which can be expected for the period - a sequence in which the boys and the lovers stop off on the trail on a Native American ""reservation"", and, hence, the stereotypically cliched dialogue and situations. However, something miraculous happens, Harpo happens upon a stringed object, transforms it into a harp and plays in duet with the ""Chief"", who plays a woodwind instrument - it's actually a great scene, which fades with the latter placing his hand gently on Harpo's shoulder. One of those rare, touching moments; the brothers were quite capable of injecting pathos into the proceedings when the moment was right.
The Big Store is contemporary - this time the Marxs' help the lovers retain a huge department store, despite tentative credentials as store detectives. Here's another one which has some good bits and pieces, contrary to the generaln consensus of film critics. We don't have over-milked gags as much as one lost opportunity after another; some of that disappointment actually due to the fact that surreal comedy was really a thing of the past by 1941. For example, in The Big Store we find Groucho asleep in the bed department. The effect is ruined by one of the supporting actors prefacing the scene with mention that Mr. Flywheel was up all night examining the books and it was okay for him to sleep there. Another scene has Harpo dressed in Revolutionary War era attire and playing the harp in duet with himself - a beautifully crafted scene. But, alas, it was in his imagination.
Margaret Dumont is on hand and she's always a pleasure to watch - she's given some decent dialogue in a typically wild courtship scene with you know who.
Both Go West and The Big Store have plenty of music, and that's not a negative, as they successfully showcase the performing talents of the Marxes. It's really astonishing to note that they could perform all kinds of comedy, plus play classical music quite impressively, even kick up their heels - Flywheel's dance moves are absolutely balletic in the otherwiseoverdrawn, impossible ""Sing While You Sell"" number.  The viewer/fan can make up his/her mind with both entries as to whether they're watching a musical comedy, a comedy with music, a comedy, or....the Marx Brothers. For deep fans there will be a plethora of coulda-shoulda(s) - both features are in a completely different cosmos from ""Duck Soup"". DVD Extra Features are entertaining for both fan and historian, including an apparent radio promo/sketch for Go West.",1178409600,7,4100,4.92485549132948

8107377,4,B000E8QVBK,"Being a film graduate with about 5 professional careers under my belt, as well as film: I have been and always will be a great fan of AMAZON. I simply must take a minute and say a few words about THE BIG STORE.
1) The well known Marx Bros. movies like DUCK SOUP have gotten most of the glory. I can say that The Big Store, is fresh and in my mind, more entertaining.
2) It seems more pure. The music is dynamic. The skits really uncluttered and with fantastic timing and action stunts.
3) The boys seem to be having a fun time.
4) The character actors are well..character actors. Wonderful.
5) The theme of this giant store selling products in this 1940 film lampoons ALL insane retail of that era.
6) Camerawork from camera operation, dolly moves, lighting, blocking, composition is all excellent.
7) Original. I love the idea of the skit with sales room deluxe fold-up wall beds and the children going nuts.
8) The gags: The elevator stunts, the roller skate chase, the gun in the camera, the photo in the dark of the bad guy being developed. The car repossession in the final scene. Recording a live record for a music fan.
9) The great Groucho lines. Referring to this black and white MGM movie: ""Technicolor is too expensive.""
10) Harpo playing cello, violin, piano, and dual harps in mirrors.
11) Artie Shaw the great clarinet player co-wrote the romantic ballad that the star sings.
12) The pace, it  really moves!
13) A nod to writer Norman Cousins, who wrote ""The Healing Heart"". He would rent a hotel room and set up a film projector and laugh along with movies such as this to recover from heart issues, away from the
hospital, and later teach at the UCLA CA Medical School, about the power of laughter.

Bottom line. Yes, I am kind of a ""bottom line-summary"" type of person. It is easy to overlook such films like this. If you get it in an Amazon Box Set or on this Combo DVD with GO WEST, just get it.
Then study it. You will enjoy it as much as I did, and find repeated viewings- rewarding.",1333929600,,2004,4.4135135135135135
