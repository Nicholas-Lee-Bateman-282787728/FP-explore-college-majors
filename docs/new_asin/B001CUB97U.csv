3520235,5,B001CUB97U,This scientific dvd is entertaining and informative. You'll learn the truth about the global warming hoax that is being foisted on us!,1235347200,5,134,5.136363636363637
3520236,5,B001CUB97U,"I just watched this program on the History Channel and was fascinated. In this age of interest and causes of climate change and the impact it can have on our lives, this program explains a lot. It talks about the impact on history and society and in the last 10 minutes addresses thoughts on the future. However, it has no difinitive causes(s) for the mini-ice age and shows there is much still to learn - and it gives no definite scenario to our future, just possibilities and potentials. Definitely a thought provoking program!",1234051200,17,529,4.698924731182796
3520237,5,B001CUB97U,Everyone should see this because it explains that global warming is not due to human intervention but is more likely due to weather cycles. I have seen this dvd before and will watch it again.,1407974400,,192,4.514285714285714
3520238,4,B001CUB97U,Saw this on the History channel recently ... immediately following the TV view went on line and ordered this DVD for my file.  VERY interesting period in earths history ('who knew' experience watching it).  Recommend,1407456000,,216,5.142857142857143
3520239,5,B001CUB97U,also has the Black Death DVD in it.  very good  DVD. I will watch it again and again. gives a preview of what we might have to face by looking at the past.,1380153600,3,155,3.6666666666666665
3520240,4,B001CUB97U,"Anyone who thinks ""global warming"" is a new phenomenon should at least read this book. The world and weather did not begin the day before yesterday.",1370476800,,148,4.730769230769231
3520241,5,B001CUB97U,Fun movie for the kids but the requirement for all these words is rediculus and time consuming so I suggest you cut it down if you want me to continue posting...:).,1368403200,,164,4.32258064516129
3520242,1,B001CUB97U,"This DVD is advertised with a run time of 100 minutes which is incorrect as the DVD I received had a run time of only 50 minutes.

3520243,4,B001CUB97U,"This is a very good DVD for family viewing, and was very popular.  It does not have any bad language or vulgarity either.",1351641600,,121,4.260869565217392
3520244,5,B001CUB97U,"When, oh when will I be able to watch this gem on Kindle Fire?  This is one of the best wanna-watch-it-all-the-way-through documentaries I've ever seen.",1339459200,,152,5.08
3520245,5,B001CUB97U,I was so impressed with this program that I bought the DVD for my grandson. It underscores how intertwined weather and history truly are and makes the subject come to life. Well done!,1309305600,4,183,4.575757575757576
3520246,4,B001CUB97U,"I did like this documentary, especially because it did not continue rehashing same tired facts every fifteen or twenty minutes to bring the viewer up to date on current and relevant events it had already brought to our attention. Omitted certain important facts, however. Facts like the mini-ice age's responsibility for being the cause of the demise of the Viking civilization. And also the reason the island of Greenland, once a lush and fertile land overgrown with trees and grass and populated with people and animals during the great warming, has since become a barren wasteland covered in thick layers of ice and snow, incapable of supporting any type of plant or animal life. Otherwise, even though there are better books on the subject, for a video, it is a captivating documentary.",1298678400,5,790,4.992424242424242
8289968,5,B001CUB97U,The show was exactly as I had seen on the History Channel.,1492387200,,58,3.9166666666666665
8289969,5,B001CUB97U,This is an interesting review a piece of history based on the impact of weather rather than the actions of man (or evolution).  Puts things in a perspective that I hadn't considered prior to seeing the program.,1477440000,,210,4.675675675675675

8289973,5,B001CUB97U,Enjoyed this documentary when it originally aired.  Anyone interested in the climate change debate (from any side) should watch this documentary.,1448496000,,145,5.904761904761905
8289974,5,B001CUB97U,"Summer 1816--northern Europe. The summer never came. Percy and Mary Shelly pass their ""summer"" vacation inoors writing scary stories. Result: Frankenstein. New England was  hit with snow in June (5 days) and some more in July. Crops died. Birds fell out of the sky, frozen to death. Lots of people head west to get out of New England. Cause of the weather: a volcano that erupted halfway around the world 14 months before. This event happened around 40 years before the end of the Little Ice Age, which had been going on for around 500 years.

Average increase in temperature was around 4 degrees. So many consequences from seemingly minimal change. 150 years later, we're now warming up. What will happen next?

You learn a lot about history but you don't realize how this climate change was responsible for so many of its outcomes. Extremely fascinating movie, and believe me, you don't have to be a science whiz to enjoy it.",1445126400,,927,4.745341614906832
8289975,5,B001CUB97U,"I watched this program on TV and was so fascinated by this previously unknown to me event that I wanted to purchase the DVD.  The program isn't preachy about 'climate change'; it's just an extraordinary peak into the not so distant past.  I also purchased the book ""The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History"" by Brian Fagan.  Also a great read.",1438128000,,347,4.564516129032258
8289976,5,B001CUB97U,Excellent! Wonderful and thought provoking.,1424563200,,43,7.8
8289977,5,B001CUB97U,"Amazing story of the Little Ice Age, about 1100-1850 AD.  This era followed the Great Warming which itself led to a flourishing of European civilization.  Because of the extreme change, Greenland may not have been a Viking real estate scam. after all.  The giant island may have had a more generous border of greenery during the Great Warming which froze in the centuries following, isolating Viking settlers from resupply from Iceland, threatening their fishing by an southern-expanding ice pack, and, ultimately, dooming the colony of legendarily tough people.  The Little Ice Age had other effects, such as insuring that Americans grew up a beer-drinking rather than wine-drinking people.  The documentary also points out how the Year Without a Summer in the early 1800's resulted from this trend, compounded by major volcanic eruptions ...which may have had more impact on weather change than is usually credited.  This History Channel special report is very illuminating and makes a good case for the Little Ice Age.",1416873600,5,1021,5.233128834355829
