2702456,4,B000LC52BE,This is a decent movie to watch.  It is a little different than the other Christian based movies I have watched in the past.  It is little more sci-fi than Christian.,1401667200,,166,4.32258064516129

2702459,5,B000LC52BE,"Different take on the UFO phenomena that is gripping the world today. Really liked the spin on this topic and the role UFOs may have in our Christian belief.

2702488,5,B000LC52BE,"While it's an interesting fictional story, it's also an excellent exposition of the truth behind UFOs and the paranormal.  Unfortunately, you have to endure the extremely obnoxious Christian-hater - the guy you never encounter in real life, only in Christian movies.  It's one of those movies that you wish unbelievers would watch, but rarely do.",1341964800,,346,5.2727272727272725

Unidentified goes into UFO sightings/abductions and the fact that most of these are from people who dabbled into the occult.

2702493,4,B000LC52BE,It was a good film.  It brings up some interesting ideas as to the answer behind the UFO phenomenon.  It also deals with doubt and faith.  I would recommend it.,1296432000,,160,4.266666666666667
2702494,4,B000LC52BE,Great movie. Gave you a whole new perspective on the UFO thing. Glad I bought it.,1286755200,,81,4.125
2702495,5,B000LC52BE,"This movie has a good message for Christians that think UFOs and aliens are legitimate. But more importantly, it is about ones relationship with Jesus Christ.

The production quality of this movie could be a little better but it's not at all bad and the message is excellent. If you enjoy Christian movies, you will probably like this one.

If you are not sure what to think about UFOs and aliens, you might want pickup a copy of ""Alien Encounters"" by Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman. It's a very informative book.

I really enjoy Christian movies but some of the older productions could be painful to sit through because of the amateurish quality. I am glad that the quality of the acting, directing, and filming techniques within the Christian film industry are improving. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience.",1279065600,,820,4.801418439716312
2702496,5,B000LC52BE,"This movie was shown at a local movie theater and it got great reviews from the audience. I purchased it to watch with my family and it was a very entertaining and thought provoking film!  My family had a good discussion about it afterwards. The movie, ""Unidentified,"" doesn't need all the Hollywood special effects because it addresses the question,""If UFO's aren't real, what explains them?""  People are divided on the issue of UFO's.  Some are sold on them, others refuse to believe them.  Until this movie came out, no one was bold enough to address this theory.  Maybe because people ""don't want to believe it.""  I recommend that people watch the movie and be ""open"" to it's answer to UFO's, you never know...it may be true. There are already so many ""blockbuster"" Alien/UFO movies on the market that point a moviegoer in only one direction (that there ""are"" UFO's and you never know if you will be the next abduction).  ""Unidentified"" is definitely not considered a Hollywood ""blockbuster,"" but this movie helps a person begin to think maybe UFO's are not what they appear to be. Some people may say the movie is pushing a message, I say it's a theory worth thinking about.",1244592000,2,1179,4.75
2702497,4,B000LC52BE,"If you believe in aliens but not in God, Then you ""must"" see this movie! IT might just change your mind, and cause you to think about where you're going when you die!",1226448000,,166,4.0606060606060606
2702517,5,B000LC52BE,"Absolutely loved this movie. I've been a huge fan of Rebecca St. James for awhile now. And I completely support her decision to go to movies and become an actress now.

She did an amazing job in this film! I can't wait to see her next film.

It was even cooler that I got to see this film on my Sky Angel box in my home. It def. was alot easier than having to drive down to the nearest Blockbuster and worry about late fees.

2702518,5,B000LC52BE,"I'm a CHRIST follower, AKA born again Christian. I will be the first person to agree that a lot of the early christian movies and even some today have low quality about them. Usually being a low budget film the makers have little to work with, but that's not why the movie is made. It's being made to get people to think about their eternal destiny. The reviews that complain about this movie seem to either not really seen it or if they saw it seem to miss certain points the movie has in them. A review claimed the people abducted were not shown to be involved in the occult, witchcraft, drinking, etc. The movie said or someone close to them is involved in the occult or witchcraft. Nothing is mentioned about drinking?? One last thing, do I hear a sigh of relief from the ones who didn't like the movie?? The 2 reporters one was a confirmed non-christian but the other as the review said was fence-sitter who isn't sure if he should accept Jesus as his Savior. But in the movie he had accepted Jesus as his Savior at a young age, but his faith was being shaken because he hadn't allowed Jesus to be part of his every day life. I consider this to be one of the better christian movies, Dave & Rich Christiano, keep cranking them out!!!",1214611200,19,1238,4.3405172413793105
2702519,2,B000LC52BE,"The film is about investigative reporters that write for ""The Other Side"" magazine.  While they are trying to figure out what story to write, they stumble upon an alleged UFO abduction.  They are dispatched a day early to Texas to cover this story (They were originally sent to Texas to cover an Oil crisis).  None of the people involved are willing to talk about it with the media, due to the ""Men-In-Black"" getting to them first telling them to ""Keep quite, this is a matter of national security"".  Two more abductions, happen, one in Louisiana, another in California (I suppose).  The abductee is unwilling to discuss it, but the witness is, willing, even after being threatened by the MIB.
One of the reporters gets a call from an unknown and anonymous source to meet him at a library, where he explains that it is a spiritual, not extraterrestrial.
They interview a woman that was abducted by them aliens, and says there will be a great evacuation of those that are impeding the advancement of the human race (she is referring to the Christians and the rapture).  One of the reporters puts it best, the there is nothing at the end of these paranormal mysteries.
The first guy that was abducted is willing to speak, but not over the phone.  So the reporters go and visit him.  Where they inform him that is demonic, not aliens from another planet.  They pray with him for deliverance.
The old ex-Special ops guy returns, and explains to them that they are dealing with the demonic, and to press forward with the truth.
Then they pull a rapture prank on the Australian reporter.

I give this film TWO stars.  Because the most interesting dialog was either cut-out/cut short or the Australian report kept accusing people of being drunk or having hallucinations, which made it irritating. If the writers and directors allowed the Ex-Special Ops guy and the female abductee to have a bigger role, and did a scene with the MIB this film would be four stars.

If you are into or know some one that is involved in the occult/paranormal, this film is definitely for them.

This film seems to have been largely based off a book titled ""Lights in the Sky & Little Green Men: A Rational Christian Look at UFOs and Extraterrestrials"" (ISBN-10: 1576832082).",1211241600,2,2248,4.704081632653061
2702520,5,B000LC52BE,This is an excellent movie! If you can watch this movie and not catch the message and understand about Christ coming back to gather his children then you are for sure going on my prayer list. This movie has a very powerful message to it....maybe you should try to watch it again and really listen to what they are saying.,1211241600,3,321,4.366666666666666
2702521,3,B000LC52BE,"Not a bad film as Christian films go.  The message is good and should,as I'm sure the intention is, give some of those who would be drawn to the occult something to think about and those of us who are Christians and know that we are not being visited by beings from other planets, an explanation for why otherwise credible witnesses might be experiencing these things.  One thing that kept me from giving this film a higher rating and frankly something that surprised our family was to see a Christian film in which the writer felt the freedom to stereotype small town southerners as ignorant and backward. Not once but several times. Shame on you.  You should know better. I know that most of the comments came from the antagonist in the film but as a southerner I felt you could have come up with a better way to create doubt as to the credibility of the first witnesses than to use a ""Hollywood"" sterotype.",1208044800,2,909,4.496969696969697

2702523,3,B000LC52BE,"Our family is always excited for the opportunity to watch an overtly Christian movie. This movie was pretty good, not great. (I'd recommend another Christiano film, ""Time Changer"", over this film.) I would have liked to see the Christian characters be less abrasive in the office, a little more Christ-like; they could have reached the same end and been nicer along the way. This movie is not a big alien or UFO movie. It is more about Satan causing UFO-type experiences to make people believe in other life forms and abductions so that when the Rapture occurs and good folks are taken ""up"" out of the midst of everyone else that the remaining people will chalk it up to aliens and not God. It was a fine movie.",1196640000,,711,4.5625

2702579,4,B000LC52BE,"My gosh!  I read all the reviews to this film... and then I bought it nontheless because I KNEW this was a Christian film with a message.  Duh!  It is a CHRISTIAN film, for crying out loud.  I read the reviews and one would think it was a Hollywood type gone beserk or something.

But then again, I guess this is what people think Christians are: loonies.  First off, the film makes no pretenses about where this is going.  Secondly, it has a Christian message to all, whether one likes it or not, you will be on the side of Jesus or you are not.  Plain and simple.  The UFO phenomena is so strong and so delusional that unless you see it for what it really is, demonic activity, you miss the point of the film.

Rich Christiano has been putting out some decent movies of late and are getting better.  He may not have the big budgets of Hollywood movies... and believe me, if he had the $80-$100 million budget, whoa! this would rival any big time Hollywood movie.

The film itself could lend to some better dialouge or even a ""heftier"" plot but its main message is that UFO is just demonic activity to delude people into believing what they want to believe and not wanting to be held accountable to the truth.  The truth is that we need Jesus to get to Heaven.  Period.  Most will not like my review but I am not here to win a popularity contest with all you ""intellectual"" types or ""real"" film critics.  I am here to tell you that this film was excellent in bringing its timely message to the masses.  This world is going through a major delusional period that is so strong that even some Christians could be even deceived.

This film has merit and is based on what is going on today.  The acting was really better than one would expect.  The story is certainly credible.  I applaud Rich Christiano for putting this forward.  I can't wait for his next project!",1183939200,81,1862,4.351744186046512
2702580,3,B000LC52BE,"I was very excited to see this movie.  Being a Christian film about UFOs, I was expecting to hear about Genesis 6, sons of God, Nephilim, etc., but there was nothing like that here.  In fact, there really was not enough about the UFO phenomenon at all.  It started out promising, but quickly digressed from investigating the UFO incidents to an interoffice debate about being saved or not.  I think it is important to include the message of salvation in Christian entertainment; however, this movie did not live up to its billing. Also, I think the end ""joke"" was very cruel and distasteful.  Maybe someday they will make a movie of Lynn Marzulli's ""Nephilim."" For a Christian perspective on UFOs, Chuck Missler is a much better resource.",1177200000,6,738,4.7795275590551185
2702581,3,B000LC52BE,"I've been hoping to see a good movie on this subject from a Christian perspective.  This isn't it.  The premise is good, the storyline and acting not so much.",1176768000,,158,4.413793103448276

UFO things always sell. And there's a strong belief in the Christian community about a UFO-demonic connection. So we make a movie about it.

What you ultimately get, however, is a lot of dangling plot lines that are never resolved, wooden characters, wooden dialogue, illogical conclusions, and ham-fisted proselitzing. This sort of work does more damage to those it's seeking to win over.

The problem is aside from some decent acting, this is really a bad movie, and done on false pretense. There is nothing wrong with trying to give the message, but maybe with a little more honestly. If you're making a UFO movie, at least show something. ""I don't believe in Aliens, but I believe in Demons"". Classic bad line.",1174953600,8,480,4.465909090909091

I threw away the movie.  I thought Hulk Hogan's ""No Holds Barred"" was the worst movie ever, but this one surpassed it 10 times over.

Bottom Line Premise - UFOs are actually the Devil.  If Jesus is not in your life you will go to Hell and might be visited by a UFO.  Also you probably have some one in your family who's a nut and is a devil worshiper or a witch and likes rotten eggs.  Heavy handed religious overtone that insulted my intelligence, with a ""you better believe"" just in case message in the end.

Acting was amature, stiff, like out of a bad play of high school students.  The music was the only saving grace.  Don't buy it.

2702586,3,B000LC52BE,"""Unidentified"" is a Christian-themed film that supposedly deals with the UFO phenomena.  What it does, however, is take the UFO phenomena and bend it to fit into a message of salvation.  There's nothing wrong with that at all, but a film promoting the Truth should make sure it has its facts right on the other ""truths"" in the film as well.

**SPOILERS**

This tale centers around the ""alien abductions"" of people and two reporters sent out to cover their stories.  One of the reporters is a firm non-believer and the other is a fence-sitter who isn't sure if he should accept Jesus as his Savior.  As the story unfolds, we are told that all of the abductions are happening to people who are into the occult, witchcraft, drinking, etc.  This ultimately leads up to a supposed ""rapture"" event that opens the eyes of the non-believing reporter.  The only problem is that it's a hoax meant to force the non-believer to think and search out his soul.  The situation with the abducted people is never resolved.  We're just left to think that it was the Devil trying to scare people into not believing and since this one non-believer is saved, there's no need to continue the abductions.

So, here's where my problems with this film stand.  First of all, not everyone who claims to have been abducted by aliens has an interest in things such as the occult, witchcraft, alcohol, etc.  Many of them seem to be fine members of society.  Secondly, scaring a person in the way that it was done in this film in order to save his soul comes off both cruel and unnecessary.  Would you honestly want to go to church with people intent on scaring you to salvation?  There's nothing wrong with explaining to someone why they should accept Jesus as their Savior, but tricking them into it is, well, just un-Christian.  I was also surprised how easily the ""Darren"" character could entice people to become Christians.  I don't know what planet he's on, but I've seen only a few cases where people are so abrasively presented with the Gospel message and so easily accepted it.

In essence, this film presents its message in a way typical of many (hopefully well-intentioned) self-proclaimed Christians.  They try to jam it down the throats of non-believers and, in my opinion, do a better job of driving away potential Christians than actually convincing them to seek out the truth.

Before going one step further, I should state that I'm a Catholic (former Protestant).  There are quite a few reasons why I left the Protestant belief system.  As regarding this film and this review, one of the reasons I left was due to mean-spirited and hateful actions of so-called Christians trying to literally force people to become Christians.  That's not the right way to do it in my opinion.  I don't fault the actors, writers, director, etc. in this film for doing what they did, because I am sure that that is what they believe will bring people to Christ.  However, I just wish Evangelical Christians would try a different tactic than forcing their religion on others.

So, I'll probably get a few nasty comments for this review.  I'm prepared for that.  But like St. Francis said so long ago:  ""Preach the Gospel at all times.  When necessary, use words.""",1172275200,15,3230,4.724508050089446
