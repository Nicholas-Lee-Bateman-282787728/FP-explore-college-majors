8411728,5,B0040319SA,"Initial D.  Anime's take on street racing.

Stage 1 Part II contains the second half of the first season of this wonderful anime series that was originally released in the late 90s.

This particular DVD collection contains the episodes involving Takumi's races against Shingo of the Night Kids, Impact Blue, Kenta of the Red Suns, and of course Ryosuke Takahashi of the Red Suns.

Stage I Part II introduces many new characters into the series, but none are more popular then the female racing team of Mako and Sayuki.  The first disc of this box set contains the romance story between Iketani and Mako which eventually leads to the race between the 86 and Sileighty.  It is one of the most memorable stories in Initial D.

The last four episodes center around Takumi's final battle against the legendary White Comet of Akagi, Ryosuke Takahashi.  The last four episodes are full of drama and excitement that it is hard to turn away from the movie screen when watching it.

Funimaton does an excellent job with their dubbing of the series, and reverts back to the original Japanese names of the characters that Tokyo Pop originally changed in order to make the series more ""American.""

If you watch the DVD in Japanese, there will be slight changes to the music during certain parts of the series, for example the conversation between Takumi and Ryosuke before they race has different background music depending what language you watch it in.

To sum up this particular DVD Box........the second half of season 1.  Takumi officially becomes the best in Gunma.

Impact Blue.  The romance between Mako and Iketani.  Ryosuke Takahashi.

Nuff Said.
