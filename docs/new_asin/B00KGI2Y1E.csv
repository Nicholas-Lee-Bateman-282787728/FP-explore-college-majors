6425264,3,B00KGI2Y1E,"The plot for ""Hell's Caretaker"" is a well thought-out concept that screams terror. Unfortunately that terror becomes lost in translation when acted out. The cast give good enough performances, even though the characters seemed a bit two-dimensional. The dialog and most situational moments play out convincingly enough and feel authentic, but a lot of little inflections and interactions seem nonsensical-not true to human nature, so the feel of those moments drop a bit. Cappello creates a nice enough story that should have been a tight nightmare, however I never felt any suspense or chill as a horror fan while watching this film.

The special effects here are obviously where budget cuts were made in ""Hell's Caretaker"" because the kill scenes seemed rushed and pushed off as ""just another scene to get through"". The blood and gore was almost nonexistent, not that every film needs it or that I have to have it to appreciate a film, but if you are gonna have a story tease and take you to that moment then the director should deliver it. Cappello never really delivers on it-it being the horror and terror aspect of this film.

Overall ""Hell's Caretaker"" is a bummer of a horror film, feeling more made-for-TV than actual indie horror. It does manage to bring to life a good drama, even has a small amount of haunting suspense in certain moments of the film, unfortunately not enough to satisfy me personally. The acting is standard with characters that are clichd but relatable and the story arch is completed. So those elements offer so compensation for the time spent watching ""Hell's Caretaker"". The real problem with the film and how Cappello chose to bring this nightmare to life is the unwillingness to show the actual horror, I am all for ""implied or suggested horror"" but I don't want to have to do all the work, I wanna see some bloody gruesomeness to help get me there.",1431907200,,1885,4.814814814814815
6425265,2,B00KGI2Y1E,"Obviously, when I picked up this movie, I wasn't looking for Oscar material.  I just wanted a good old fashioned slasher flick to curl up with on a chilly October night.
 Even by slasher standards, it was awful.  I didn't like it at all.  The caretaker was an irritating jerk.  Among the victims we had the girl who was too conceited to be likable, and the stoner who only cared about getting wasted.  Cliche after cliche.
 The whole movie was a waste of time.  There was even, (I kid you not) a ten minute scene in which the caretaker, in a emotionless monotone, explains to the group what a fisher cat is.  Who cares?
 The only redeeming quality about this movie was the dog.  The dog has a brain tumor, and his owner is thinking about putting him down.  The dog is the only one in the whole movie I cared about.",1414108800,3,814,4.282894736842105

6425269,1,B00KGI2Y1E,Sad!! I'm guessing actors worked for free to get use to the felling so when a real movie opportunity can along they could say they had some experience.,1472774400,,151,4.428571428571429

6425273,4,B00KGI2Y1E,"Actually I thought the movie was pretty good.  Good acting and the dog was adorable.  So here is a BIG spoiler alert............DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN""T WATCHED THE MOVIE.......but I have a question.  What happened to the Marine?  He was alive.  Did he die from the elements?  Or was he the one still alive or were they talking about the dog??  Other than that I thought the movie was good.  I would have like to seen more make it though.  I like a happy ending.",1472515200,,464,4.3023255813953485
6425274,2,B00KGI2Y1E,Ok all I can say is what the hell did I just watch. Not sure I even watched most of it lost interest and left it playing in the back ground and yep didn't miss a thing in the 10 to 20 min i was away. would not recommend.,1472342400,,220,3.510204081632653

6425276,1,B00KGI2Y1E,"Undoubtedly THE worst, and most lame attempts at action scenes I've seen in a very long time!  A waste of over an hour of my time trying to watch this poor attempt at a slasher movie.  The directing was none existent, and the audio was horrible throughout this movie.  The dog was the most compelling character in this film.",1471564800,2,324,4.4576271186440675
8658403,2,B00KGI2Y1E,"This movie is absolutely lame!

We see people partying as someone gets beat up in an upper room.  While playing table hockey someone mentions wearing a jockstrap.  The female competitor says ""Who wears a jockstrap? An old man trying to prevent a hernia?""  I like the punk song that plays here.  It says the f word a lot but it sure is catchy!  Meanwhile we see a woman running around from a hockey mask wearing killer outside.  A man pulls up and asks if she's out there.  It's now the next day.  We see a man driving... and the catchy punk rock continues!  He arrives to the home and barn he's renting.

The story is messy so far.  We see a group of young men and women arrive to a home, and this scene goes back to men and women in a bar partying and having conversations.  The bartender mentions it's never okay to shoot someone's dog and compares it to the black guy dying last in a horror movie- you just don't do it.  It might not be noticeable yet, but the dog theme continues in a strange way later on.  At the house a finicky woman screams over a mouse.  The neighbor.old man says the power outage might last a while.  Since the phone's are out there must be some real damage due to the cold or snow.  They'll need to rely on a generator.  The men and women ask about a wheelchair and ride for their disabled friend.  The old man can make it happen.  He won't let a serviceman ride in the back of a U-Haul.

The old man tells a story about a car rear ending him... after he landed an airplane.  He stopped driving planes after that.  He mentions a skiing trip and invites the young men and women to come along.  They walk to the back yard and light a fire.  For some reason the finicky woman wants to light it.  A nice country song plays here.  It lasts a while while the finicky girl wants to know where she can get a phone signal.  She goes inside and gets a shower.  Meanwhile a woman lets the dog in from outside.

The old man comes by and asks if these people need anything.  He mentions there's a creature outside called the fishercat.  It doesn't eat fish and it's not a cat.  It's called a fishercat because it's more of a ferret than a skunk.  Fishercats eat porcupines.  The old man says he saw a fishercat bite a porcupine right in the face.  They can eat small cats and dogs.  The people continue to sit around talking and listening to slow country tunes.  The finicky woman reveals she's an actress while riding in the truck with the old man.  He keeps grabbing her while they're having a discussion about animals and it's hilarious.  No wonder would continue a conversation about that!  He says ""I like nice pink skin"" while touching her hair.

The old man gets out of his truck to call a deer.  The old man asks the girl to call a deer.  He was nice but now he's obviously a total jerk.  Touching the girl's leg just adds more to his jerkness!  He says ""I told you to call like a deer- not bark like a fish!""  He then wraps a bag around her body.  He says he'll take care of her and says ""Nobody judges the hunter"".  He then tosses a spear into her back as she tries to run.  ""Looks like that grave will have to be a little bigger"".  The old man... then does something... with his truck door open... and to be honest I don't know what it is.  The dog's right in front of him though.  That's all I'll say!  It's clear a hunter and an actress being together are like water and oil though.

The men and women back at the house get the generator started while partying.  The old man drops by and asks if anyone needs help.  What a nice man!  The old man hangs around and plays the steel drums and cards while saying it smells like a marijuana factory in here.  One of the guys can't sing at all and he's annoying.  The old man talks about drugs and porn that belonged to the one guy's father.  That catchy punk song we heard in the beginning returns.  They continue to party while this old man basically invites himself along!

The teens have a dog funeral outside with terrible music while the old man pushes the girl he killed in a wheelbarrow.  It looks like he's pushing the girl towards the funeral which would be fitting, but no, he's taking her to his barn.  The old killed a deer and plans to quarter it tonight.  The one guy wants to know when they're going skiing.  Yeah, about that skiing.  And the plane ride!  Why are these characters not doing these things and instead staying here partying and having animal funerals?  How depressing.

Okay here we go.  Plane rides and skiing, while the second catchiest song of the movie plays again.  Uh oh he's up there in the plane alone with a woman.  It's okay-  he teaches her how to fly instead of grabbing her legs.  The same country song plays when the group returns.  Wow, the same 3 songs... play again... in the same order as before!  Not that I mind these songs but wow is this movie low budget.  The female who doesn't like seeing animals tortured happens to stumble into the room where the old man's butchering a deer.  She sees the dog that was supposed to be put down.  The old man couldn't bare to see it killed.  Funny he makes her promise not to tell and the first thing she does when she walks through the front door is yell ""Porter lives!!!""

The me and women puts the pieces together and realizes the finicky girls wallet is still here so something is wrong.  The old man bashes a bottle over the young guy's head before the old man gets knocked out by someone else.  They decide to head into town to figure out what's going on.  The old man pulls out a gun and shoots the one guy in the stomach in a VERY bad acting performance.  Maybe he was shocked that he just got shot, but it was bad.  The girls outside think the boys are just messing around when they hear a gunshot, LOL!  The girls see the old man walk by the upper window of the barn and question what's going on.

The old man does some rearranging then drives after the two women who are running away.  He runs the one over in a very poor moment of suspense.  The girl who hates animals being tortured and eaten finds out what's going on.  The old man storms in the room and asks where she went.  The girl heads to the basement while the man looks for her.  As she tries to drive away, she sees her dead friend on the ground.  She fires an arrow and shoots the old man.  She puts the dog in the truck and grabs the serviceman who's in the basement.  He climbs up the stairs and the girl pulls him to safety.

The old man walks outside and shoots the woman leaving the serviceman alone in his wheelchair.  The old man walks up to the serviceman and he punches the man, then bashes the old man with a flashlight.  It seems he takes forever to turn his wheelchair around while the old man had plenty of time to retaliate if he wanted to.  The serviceman gets in the truck and runs over the old man's feet.  We see all the victims who died lying on the ground together including the old man.  So weak!  The cops find the dog alive.  Thank goodness!  He's the most important one of the group.

This movie is beyond bad I'm afraid.  The old man just isn't a good bad guy.  He's really not.  He can't even portray someone who's secretly a vicious murderer.  He's too kind.  He was the wrong choice for this role.  The acting's bad too.  Avoid.",1500681600,,7290,4.218181818181818
