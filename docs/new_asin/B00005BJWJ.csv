1425070,3,B00005BJWJ,"A 1951 French-Italian production, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's unjustly maligned ""Atoll K"" deserves another look  particularly in regard to the now-available German version. If you have only seen the mutilated public-domain dupes of ""Utopia"" (the 1954 U.S. release), the 87-minute ""Dick und Doof erben eine Insel"" is quite a surprise in terms of its excellent print quality and the additional subplot with co-star Suzy Delair. The team's cinematic swansong includes some memorable sight gags and a surprising amount of political satire. Though somewhat marred by Stan and Ollie's declining health, the admirably offbeat ""Atoll K"" remains superior to the team's post-Hal Roach efforts.",1294617600,3,686,5.596153846153846
1425071,2,B00005BJWJ,"While the silent-era comedies of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are well represented on DVD, the majority of the team's sound films remain unavailable here in the U.S. The fact that UTOPIA, their final film, is readily available everywhere is a bitter pill for most of their fans to swallow.

In 1950 Stan and Ollie traveled to France to make the movie, which was originally titled ATOLL K. In this uneasy blend of political satire and slapstick, the boys inherit a yacht and wind up on an uncharted atoll, which they try to establish as a new country. This ill-fated little picture saw limited release in Europe during 1951-52, and received scant distribution in the U.S. as UTOPIA in 1954.

Aside from the erratic quality of the script and the production, the biggest drawback is the unhealthy physical appearance of the boys themselves. Hardy is at his all-time heaviest, while Laurel contracted dysentery during location shooting and wound up losing over 50 pounds. Here, their ""fat and skinny"" personas are more like ""obese and emaciated."" That they're still able to rustle up a handful of laughs and perform with some degree of enthusiasm speaks volumes about their dedication to their craft and their comedic gifts. To his dying day (February 23, 1965), Laurel considered the film one of the most painful experiences of his career.

This Goodtimes edition is one of the better-quality copies in circulation, though it doesn't compare to the sparkling 35mm print I saw at a revival theater back in the 1970s.",1132358400,19,1512,4.921568627450981
1425072,4,B00005BJWJ,"I'm kinda surprised at all of the negative reviews here.  I had been staying away from this film because of the negative reviews and the low price which is usually an indicator of quality of the work.  Don't miss this one!!  For review reference, I personally think Sons of the Desert is the boys best film, I did not find Pardon Us or Flying Dueces too funny, but I thought Utopia was hilarious with plenty of great laughs in the first five minutes alone.  Sure the plot get's a little too involved towards the end but what movie doesn't?  The entire first hour was great with lots of the signature comedy you're looking for!

Even when he was old, sick, and overheated from the hot weather on the island, Stan Laurel proves himself to be one of the, if not THE, finest comedian in film history. Although the sound and picture quality here is more like a 1930's film(it was 1951!?!), I am glad to own this one. The Boys' last 30 seconds on film was most appropriate and is just how the world will always remember them.  Not to be missed!!

For reference, the DVD release by the Goodtimes is currently the best picture quality available for this title - some of the other releases are almost unwatchable.

Don't be fooled by the low Amazon rating.  Even the two star reviews here cite remarkable performances and that the Boys still have some of the old magic left. I think the negative reviews here probably stem from people hard to accept the boys as old and sick and the overall production values(Stan was too ill to participate in editing the film and it does suffer a bit as a result).

Trust me, the bits here are just as funny or even funnier than most of their feature length stuff. John Wayne was sick and tired when he filmed his last movie, The Shootist, which proved his high caliber performance ability just as Utopia does for Stan and Ollie.  ""It ce'tainly does!""",1127692800,19,1877,4.472140762463343
1425073,2,B00005BJWJ,"The Boys' last and supposedly worst film together. It has a notorious reputation and much of it is justified. Stan DOES look old and frail. Ollie DOES look dangerously obese. It's poorly dubbed (apparently none of the other performers could speak English), the picture quality is far worse than their 1930s material even after DVD treatment and the gags are lame, tired and in places cringe-inducingly childish. The plot, while pretty original and perhaps even daring for the time is convuluted and as far from the classic Laurel and Hardy as ever.

What does redeem the film are the performances from the two leads. Their acting was remarkable considering they were not well men at the time. Oliver Hardy's acting was as commandingly brilliant as it had always been and a further example of how much of an under-rated actor he was. Meanwhile, Stan Laurel was amazingly physical here despite his obvious illnesses. There's at least one scene where both men are running along a beach. Which comes to the observation that the scenery was very pretty!

'Atoll K' is probably the worst Laurel and Hardy film ever made. But it isn't as bad as some would make out.",1124668800,4,1158,4.814070351758794
1425074,2,B00005BJWJ,"I have mixed emotions about this one. Laurel and Hardy fans SHOULD see this one, because it is the last film the boys did.
But be prepared, Stan was in poor health at the time. He was a diabetic and suffered terribly during the heat. He was only 60, but looked like death warmed over. The film is NOT typical L&H comedy, but a poor attmept at political satire. Sorry folks, that just WASN'T the boys style. With poorly dubbed dialog for the non-English speaking performers, it's a little irritating at first. There is still some magic left, like Stan ""burping"" his pet lobster, when he and Ollie take the boat engine apart, only to have the pieces fall overboard and where Stan pours oil over troubled water. I just wish the film had been made when the boys were in better health and could have had more controll. In his final years,even Stan called this film an ""abortion""  True fans of L&H should remember them in their prime, like ""The Music Box""
and ""Way Out West""",1048118400,14,968,4.468926553672317

1425077,5,B00005BJWJ,"Still funny after all these years.

Laurel and Hardy's comedy dates back to the 1910s and 1920s. This movie,""Utopia,"" was released in 1951. It was their last one together. Their brand of comedy, despite decades of show biz, never gets old. It's like old vintage wine; it gets better, richer, more full-bodied with the passing of time. If one wants to trace the nuts and bolts of movie comedies, one would start with Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, Fatty Arbuckle, and Buster Keaton. Laurel and Hardy's comedy dates back to the silent era.

This movie, Utopia, starts out with Laurel and Hardy visiting inheritance lawyers in London. Stan's wealthy uncle had left him money in a will, plus a Pacific Island, in the Atoll, Polynesia, and a yacht. Once the lawyers finish calculating, charge their fees, and taxes are deducted, all that remains are the Island and the boat.

Off they go to unchartered Pacific waters. On board are Antoine, who got fired from his other job on a boat, and Giovanni, a stowaway. Antoine is picked to be the chef. While eating in the cabin, someone steals Stan's food. Then someone steals Ollie's food. They think the culprit are each other. This missing food sets up a comedy routine between the two graceful comedians. In the end, they find out a stowaway has snuck onto the boat, and is the one stealing their food.

Funny routines as the missing food is paced throughout the movie. Also there's one when the boat's engine dies, Stan borrows Ollie's pants to use as a sail to propel the boat. Comic routines continue when the boat hits rocks, and they are now shipwrecked. On the Island, which Ollie names Crusoe Land, the four settle in. After a few more comic routes, Cherie shows up. Played by Suzy Delair, she is a nightclub chanteuse fleeing her jealous newly wed husband, Lt. Jack Frazier, who is in the navy and is content that she had left him after their marriage.

When Cherie sends a distress message, Lt. Frazier is notified, and wants the navy boat to rescue her, plus the four shipwreck members. Lo and behold, others also discover the Island and move there, creating a village.

The new community impeaches Ollie as Mayor. A new Mayor is elected, and he plans to hang them.

Brutal yet all is done with humor. There's a chuckle every minute. Visually, one could see Ollie had gained weight, and Stan aged, yet they are still their wacky selves.

For some odd reason, however, possibly to add  drama, the navy finds the Island is loaded with Uranium. The once uninhabited island becomes packed. Instead of the four shipwreck castaways of Crusoeland, the island is now inundated with settlers and navy personnel.

As tradition from the old days of show biz, Ollie tells Stan, ""Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into."" Yet, it's more ""like another fine comedy."" From the days of silence movies to the talkies, Laurel and Hardy have made audience laugh, laugh, and laugh. From the early days of silent movie continued all the way through the beginning of the 1950s with this movie ""Utopia.""",1443398400,2,3042,4.733459357277883

The opening music identifies the actors. The story starts in London where Stanley inherited property. It is in paper money: pounds, francs, and lira. Charges and taxes are deducted, the pile shrinks. There is a boat in Marseilles and an island in the South Seas. There are more fees and taxes for the boat. Some cats are aboard. There is a life raft too. ""What about me?"" Their supplies are carried aboard. A stateless man is on the dock, he is not allowed to land. They find a way to relocate him. [Do they repeat their old skits from the 1930s?] They brought along Antoine, a cook. Stan misses a piece of food. So does Ollie. ""Here's how!"" A hidden hand helps himself! Will the wrong man be blamed?

Can Olllie fix the engine? The gas tank is empty! They find a stowaway on board. [Were some voices dubbed?] There is comic confusion. A life preserver sinks. An emergency sail works. But the weather changes as a storm arises. More comic gags below deck. The wind breaks the mast. [Note the use of models.] The sea tosses their boat upon an island. The cook gathers lobsters. They plant crops on land. Elsewhere a bride says she will continue her career. The groom disagrees and leaves. [Part of modern life?] A boat passes near the island. A girl lands to find a refuge. The men share a bedroom. ""Goodnight Ollie."" Ollie snores. But bats enter the bedroom for comedy. Stan finds a new use for sandpaper. Cherie's dinner causes the men to weep. The men build her a house.

Can the Lieutenant rescue Cherie? ""No."" This island is loaded with uranium! What country will own this island? Whose citizen first landed on it? The stateless man landed first! An international commission will decide who owns this new island. Can they create their own country from Atoll K? Yes, and they write a constitution. Ollie is elected President. Stanley is ""the people"". They adopt a flag. Crusoeland has no immigration laws or taxes! People arrive by the hundreds. Mining operations begin for the valuable ore. Soon some people create trouble. There will be laws and taxes now. People object. ""What did he say?"" What if there is a revolt and a new President? Cherie calls Lt. Fraser for help! Can she rescue the condemned? ""Hurry up!"" The crowd runs off, then chases the four original settlers.

Another storm arises to drive away the people. The island sinks again below the waves. The five are rescued by a ship. Lt. Fraser will marry Cherie for years of happy marriage. We see the fate of the others. The boys are put on their rightful island with food supplies. But there is a problem due to their non-payment of taxes! Their supplies and island are confiscated. `Well, here's another fine mess you've gotten me into.""

Did the underlying theme reflect their financial problems? Their pre-war wealth may have shrunk with post-war inflation and rising taxes so they needed to make another movie for money. Those who invested in land in the 1930s became wealthier. This international cast is a novel feature. Was this less funny than there earlier short comedies? Too philosophical? Full-length comedies are rare, they need a good story or drama. You can't have a government without armed forces to defend people and borders, and collect taxes.",1340409600,,3249,4.72310405643739
