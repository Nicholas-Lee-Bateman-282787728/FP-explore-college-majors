8204262,5,B00005R1MH,"One of their best performances caught on film. Jello at the end is a great bonus. Highly recommended. The VHS version has an extra song on it, ""Great Balls of S***"".",1480118400,,165,4.354838709677419
8204263,5,B00005R1MH,"bought this originally  on vhs and was sad 2 think it was the end
DOA have been one of the true punk bands from the late 70s
they meant what they say and never compromised
love every minute and jello was great 2
also get the companion lp or cd
glad it wasn't the end
joey keep rocken on",1301097600,,286,3.847457627118644
