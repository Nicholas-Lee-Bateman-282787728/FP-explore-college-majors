I was so glad when the parents were able to tell their children they got their Visas - what a joyful scene!",1444867200,,266,4.520833333333333
8416196,5,B0044LWL94,"This was a refreshing and touching true story. I liked the fact that it wasn't sensationalized or manipulative like so many ""reality"" TV shows are. The special features are also very helpful to those wanting to get a visa. Makes you realize many people have huge roadblocks to seeing family.",1286409600,,291,4.84
