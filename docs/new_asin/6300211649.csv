261785,3,6300211649,"Not A bad movie, bought the VHS version back in the 90's. The late country star Dottie West has a featured role in the film. Dottie's not in it very much, but makes good with the little screen time she's given. It's not a bad little movie, but some of the special effects are kinda hokey. I only recommend this if you are a fan of any of the stars of this film. As a Dottie West fan, I had to have this DVD.",1318550400,2,407,3.857142857142857
261786,1,6300211649,"A good history legend made crappy by overzealous hollywood writers. As is typical of most movies from the mid eighties era. The writing is crappy, the actors could just barely pull it off. And who cares about a lil kid with progeria. Id rather have a real life midget in makeup play the alien than the kid with no acting experiance. This all seems like a Make-A-Wish foundation event gone horribly wrong. Dont waste your money!!!!",1233014400,3,430,4.671052631578948
261787,2,6300211649,"Almost a sub ""B"" movie.  If I didn't like scifi so much, I would probably give it a one star.  It's difficult to try to judge a movie on the character based on the time and electronic wizardary available when the movie was made.  The acting is stilted and a little stale.  If you think of this movie as a re-enactment of supposed events, it's tolerable.",1215302400,,353,4.303030303030303
261788,3,6300211649,I saw this movie as a kid and I loved it.  It stars a child actor with progerian disease as an alien stuck in Aurora.  A few children and a crotchety old man become friends with the alien and help him.  Its quite cheesy but its a cute little tale  with lots of magic.....a true 80's movie.....but definitely one of the cheesiest.,1056585600,12,329,4.258064516129032

7806488,3,6300211649,Disappointed this doesnt carries closed-captioning or English subtitles. Hope there will be release with newer update that comes with English subtitles.,1517529600,,152,6.285714285714286
7806489,4,6300211649,An interesting story. The acting and theatrics were ok. Check out the Internet information on the event.,1503446400,,104,5.176470588235294
7806490,5,6300211649,"I live about 18 miles from Aurora and had seen the movie a long time ago.  I bought 2 copies, one for my Aunt, who had read about The Aurora Encounter and one for me!",1497398400,,166,3.742857142857143

7806492,3,6300211649,"This is a super cheesy movie. But I'm from the area the movie is about, so it was worth the purchase to me.",1380672000,,107,3.6956521739130435
7806493,2,6300211649,"I did not expect to see a ET type movie about this widely reported event in Texas!
Disappointing. Fanciful and goofy! p",1378944000,,119,4.454545454545454
7806494,2,6300211649,"I viewed this movie on Cinamax when it was free with your cable account when cable first came, it seems to me after purchasing this DVD a lot has been cut from this DVD, the main story remains but there are missing scenes, likely lost scenes from degression sitting collecting dust in heat of summer or cold of winter, where ever it was stored, what does remain is very much worth a viewing, it is spiritual though not religious...",1345075200,,431,4.468354430379747
7806495,3,6300211649,Based on real events slightly. I thought the movie would be a little more mysterious like an 80s sci-fi movie but it played out more like an after school special. Id watch it again for laughs but it was worth watching and would be interesting and fun to watch at 11 years old. Buy it for a sleepover.,1341532800,,300,4.189655172413793
7806496,5,6300211649,"This was a fun and entertaining film about the supposed crash of a mysterious alien airship in Texas during the old west. Filmed strictly for entertainment, and not meant to be serious, but a neat story and good acting.",1341360000,,219,4.641025641025641
