7905436,1,B000009DIW,"Having started watching the show not at Vol. 1 but at Vol. 2, I may have missed something. However, I most sincerely doubt it. While I do not know why Ken is running around with two little annoying kids, or why one of the female character's hair color seems to change, or why people think it's possible to put one's fingers through another person's flesh, I do know that I was COMPLETELY disappointed with this feature, and wasted the $4.99 that I bummmed off of my pal and now owe her.
I understand that this dates way back to the eighties, but the animation is so dissinteresting that I could not push myself to watch past the second episode on the tape. Ken's eyebrows are too big, and Shin... well, Shin's just plain ugly. The plot is boring, and the voices are irritating. I don't even WANT to try to sit through the dubbed version of this crap.
I apologize to everyone who's a fan of Fist of the North Star, but I'm just not seeing it. I begged my friend to buy this for me anticipating guts and violence, and all I got was a three ring circus of multi-colored mohawks, ugly blonde-haired guys named Shin, and eye brows that look like wooly-worm caterpillars. Spend your time with another ""classic"" and try to avoid the mistake I made by purchasing this title.",1087171200,,1266,4.437768240343348
7905437,5,B000009DIW,"In this second tape, containing episodes 4-6, Kenshiro continues his quest to find Shin, and begins to find a connection between him and Lord King. In the original comic, Kenshiro reaches Shin's castle and fights him immediately, but the TV series draws out the storyline; Kenshiro makes it to his castle, but instead of Shin, a mysterious adversary named Joker awaits. The soundtrack and voice acting are excellent despite the somewhat old animation. Buy this.",992908800,,461,5.16
7905438,4,B000009DIW,"As another reviewer said, they have taken out the song at the end of each episode (nor did they bother to sing it in English, they merely left the words out).
I was at a convention when I bought this and I realized too  late I had gotten a Dubbed version.
All of the original blood, gore, etc.  is still there, but with the annoying high pitched voice of the girl, and  the dead-pan voice over of Kenshiro, I am looking forward to putting this  to a fire and getting myself the Subbed version. I suggest you do the  same...",935107200,2,523,4.19
