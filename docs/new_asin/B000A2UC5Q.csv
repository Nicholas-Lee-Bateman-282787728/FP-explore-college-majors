8072803,3,B000A2UC5Q,"This is a strange series, and I've only seen this installment of it.  I caught the story in the middle, it seems, because I was a little lost at first.  As a result of some experiment gone horribly wrong, the sky turns into a shimmering psychadelic mirror, electronic technology (computers,etc) no longer function, and children start being born with all these strange psionic (or magical?) powers.  There seems to be two opposing groups of these powerfully endowed children...one group, nominally the protagonists, under the mysterious, dark Countess, and a more renegade, terrorist-like gang known only as Gilgamesh.  They are led by the mad scientist whose horrible experiment wounded the sky.  His daughter and son are allied, nominally, with the Countess and her charges, but they'd rather be left alone, but are forced to choose sides by the circumstances.  The countess strikes a bargain with a scientific team that is seeking to reverse the effects of the original experiment, in order to fix the sky.  But the Gilgamesh gang keeps sabotoging their project.  This installment ends as the two groups clash at the project site (right when it was just starting to get interesting).

The voice dub acting in English is good, althought based on the way the characters are drawn, I would've gone with British voice actors, but that's just my personal aesthetic choice.

Story starts off VERY slow, but it draws you in.

It's a little creepy, and there's some hint of incest between the older sister and younger brother, or at least inappropriate attraction.  All the characters are really ambivalent, and there's no clearly defined ""good"" side.",1150156800,,1645,5.074349442379182
