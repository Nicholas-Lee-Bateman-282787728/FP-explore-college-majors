8145732,5,B000IJ6V56,"Porn in the 70s was better than anything produced today. Seka, Vanessa Del Rio, Linda Lovelace...man they were the best at what they did. Though John Holmes was good, I think Johnny Keyes was better because he really seemed to enjoy the moment (if you know what I mean). Maybe I feel this way because I was a kid sneaking into my uncle's stash, but I will take the 70s porn stars over any other era. If you enjoy adult entertainment, add this DVD to your collection.",1275609600,,466,4.367816091954023

8145734,5,B000IJ6V56,"What a great DVD set.  If you love silent films, that get down to business, this is one for you.  Along with all of 42nd Street Pete's other collections, this one is what porn was and always will be about.

More bang for your buck!!!!!!",1173312000,6,236,4.2
8145735,2,B000IJ6V56,"Visually, these are a step up from the other colection of loops that 42nd St. Pete has made available. Again, Pete's intros and histories are more interesting then the actual loops, which are tedious and kind of dull. They are truly a case of ""if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all."" Yep, that's a young John Holmes or Seka, and so what? There's a slight historical interest in seeing what passed for porn in the days before VCRs, but that only goes so far. These at least have a much better look then the stuff shot in the 60s, so that's a blessing, but these really are for a specialized taste, or for an older viewer who might be nostalgic for what turned him on way back when. I'm not that viewer, so a few of these loops go a long way.",1170201600,12,742,4.195804195804196
