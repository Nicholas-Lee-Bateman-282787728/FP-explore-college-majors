8472959,5,B004XZI7E4,"First saw this show on the interwebs years ago and thought the guy hosting was a bit of a tool with his mindless chuckling, but I have to say, this is a great show and Stacey is a real car guy.
he does find a way to make things interesting and relevant.
I found myself wanting to go out and work on my projects after every episode, Stacey's enthusiastic banter is just the nudge i need to motivate me to try more difficult repairs and maintenance.
A must for all budding car builders or enthusiasts.",1318377600,2,499,4.2631578947368425
