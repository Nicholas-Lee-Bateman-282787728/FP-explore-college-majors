8140081,3,B000HKCSY4,"I was surprised there was no Tab or Music sheets to acompany this DVD, It's a learn by watching the screen. They could of spent a little more money and added the song sheets.",1378598400,,174,4.147058823529412
8140082,5,B000HKCSY4,"This is a great collection of fiddle music done by a great fiddler including some of Randy's originals. What a shame that we lost this person before he had a chance to share more of his talent with us. There is no sheet music with this, so learning to play the tunes requires ability to play by ear. He does slow some of the songs down so you can work on some of the more difficult sections. Some of the close ups show his finger placement well. Since it is in video form, I was not able to use my audio slowdowner to play it at reduced speed. I believe there are some video slowdowners available now that would be helpful for someone wanting to work out all the great embellishments that Randy puts into his music.",1353196800,,715,4.226277372262774
8140083,1,B000HKCSY4,"Randy is, hands down, a phenomenal player.  He not only performs each of the thirteen piece superbly, but additionally provides some interesting discussion of the material.  However, as instructional material without any sheet music or tab, it falls well short expectations.  The ""instruction"" apparently consists of video of Randy's left hand as he plays each piece slowly - this is really good, but without any sheet music to go along with the DVD, the student is required to follow along trying to mimic what Randy's doing.  This could have been a great instructional tool had sheet music been included.

All of this, of course, just my opinion.",1325116800,,648,5.018691588785047
