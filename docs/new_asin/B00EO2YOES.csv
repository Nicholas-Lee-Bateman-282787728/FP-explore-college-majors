One thing about movies that aren't that good. They make easy movies to write about and take up less time. This is one of those movies.

A London gangster is captured and wakes to find himself in a small Italian town. He has no idea why hes there or who has taken him. He gets glimpses of what was going on just before, his being shot in the middle of a club in London, but never enough to quite be sure of what is happening.

As the story moves forward he meets an elderly business owner in town and befriends him. This man continues to ask him if he remembers anything but refuses to reveal what is happening and why he is there. He sees various things happening to the old mans family. He sees a young man who is after the old mans granddaughter and doesnt like him but cant quite say why. He also continues to have flashbacks to his own father from when he was young.

To find a way to let you know whats happening, which most will figure out early on, and it not be a total spoiler is near impossible. Suffice to say that by the end you don't really care. The pacing is terrible, the acting is okay and the most anger inducing thing it that Ray Winstones name was used to sell this picture to fans but his part is so small. No, thats not him in the lead role, hes the dad that is remembered.

This is one of those movies that you watch and at the end realize you had it figured out within the first 20 minutes and wonder why you bothered with the following 70 afterward. It leaves you feeling nothing. The best I can say is that it wasn't the worst movie Ive even sat through even though it tried to be that film.",1445904000,,1673,4.103975535168196

8607294,2,B00EO2YOES,"Tony Lord (Glen Murphy) is lying in a pool of blood in the first scene. The next thing you know he is in Italy, covered with blood. He enters a small village which we quickly figure out is an existentialist setting. Tony meets Francesco (Giovanni Capalbo) the only man in the village that will talk to him. Francesco is concerned about his daughter (Serena Iansiti) running off with an Englishman (Christopher Hatherall) who is a bad seed. Tony has flashbacks to his own life both as a child and an adult. He sees the negativity in his life and must come to terms with the idea that his mother would have been better off had she stayed in Italy.

The film was boring. There wasn't much action, just low grade drama. It seemed that Tony couldn't recognize his own parents as youths which added to the confusion of the story. For those who expect to see a good crime drama need to look elsewhere. This is more like an art film by people who don't know how to do art films.",1397088000,4,970,4.359116022099448
