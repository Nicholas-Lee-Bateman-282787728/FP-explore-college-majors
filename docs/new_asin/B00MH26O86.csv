8672212,4,B00MH26O86,"This DVD is great if you want a lighter cardio workout. The instructor is friendly. The 30 minute workouts seem to go really fast. As another reviewer wrote, I don't really break a sweat until about 20 minutes in and it is only a 30 minute workout. This is for a beginner to intermediate - not for an advanced exerciser. All in all, a good DVD. Great for those days when you want to workout without killing yourself. It's mainly cardio as I am not sore in any specific area after doing either workout.",1430697600,2,501,4.340425531914893

8672215,3,B00MH26O86,"I'm of two minds about this DVD. I can see how it would be helpful to beginners, but only to beginners. It's got two different half-hour workouts that incorporate alternating toning (weights and other resistance exercises) and cardio segments.

The cardio segments are inspired by kickboxing. I say ""inspired by"" because it seems apparent that the instructor does not have any training in actual kickboxing. (Neither do I, but I've done workouts designed by actual martial artists and their form is quite different.) The ""ab crank"" move in workout 2 is like nothing I've ever seen in an actual kickboxing workout. And if the uppercuts being shown were actually thrown in a match, you'd end up punching someone much shorter than you who was at least an arm's length away. However, if you are just looking for some cardio moves to do, these are fun enough. I didn't really work up a sweat until about 20 minutes into each workout; unfortunately, the workouts are only 30 minutes.

The bulk of the DVD is low-impact, though there are a few jumping moves (but there's a demonstrator who avoids most of the jumping if you need that modification). You don't need a lot of equipment, just a single set of weights. In workout 1, the instructor says you need light and medium weights. But then you never actually pick up the medium weights at any time during the workout. I'd suggest starting with at least 5 pound weights unless you're super new to exercise, and then you might want to go down to 3. You could also just substitute a single medium (say, 8 pound) weight during the exercises where you're only holding one weight.

There is apparently an app associated with this DVD; I don't have a smartphone so I can't comment on that. However, the DVD says the app comes with two free workouts, so if you are looking to get the most for your dollar, it might be worth checking out. (I prefer to do workouts from a full-sized TV screen, but that's just me.) Unfortunately, the menu choice for ""calendar"" directs you to a website that I could not access from my TV. So I don't know how long (in weeks/months) you would have to work out or how many workouts you'd have to do per week to lose the claimed 5 pounds.

The set is a large, clean, spacious room with a lot of pink in the background (but it's pretty simple and not distracting). The music isn't too memorable. The respective volumes of the music and the instructor's voice are appropriate -- you can always hear what Ms. Brin is saying. She's very fit and perky (and the demonstrators in the background also clearly know what they're doing; one does advanced moves and one modifies to make things easier). And she does have some good things to say about taking time for yourself. Since this DVD is apparently directed at mothers (Ms. Brin seems to be involved with a group called ""Moms into Fitness""), that's a nice message.

If you are new to exercise and are pressed for time, you will probably find some value in these. If you are intermediate or advanced, and want to do the same type of workout (i.e., cardio interspersed with strength training), or if this has become too easy for you, I'd recommend most of the full-length DVDs from The Firm. (Although there are some options in this DVD for making certain moves more difficult, and you should definitely challenge yourself with those as you move along, it's not quite the same as having an advanced workout available.)

In the end, this could work for beginners who are pressed for time. But once you start to get fitter, you may find that this simply doesn't challenge you enough.",1421798400,,3589,4.617554858934169
8672216,5,B00MH26O86,"I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD; prior to this purchase, I had never heard of Lindsay Brin, so I was a bit hesitant.  I work out 6 times a week mostly using Jillian Michaels' DVDs, but I wanted to try something different.

I am so glad I ordered this DVD (and for such a great price)!  Lindsay's approach & style is different from Jillian Michaels. Lindsay alternates between 3 minutes of toning & 3 minutes of cardio kickboxing.  I personally loved this style & technique.  The kickboxing segments were fun & really got my heart rate up.  Lindsay is also warm & friendly, but not cheesy & annoying.

Like another reviewer mentioned, these workouts are TOTAL body workouts; you will work your glutes, biceps, triceps, chest, abs, etc.  All in 30 minutes!!

I can't wait to try other workouts from Lindsay Brin!",1419897600,5,819,4.671328671328672
8672217,4,B00MH26O86,Fun workouts!  The time goes by fast and I like that there are different difficulty levels demonstrated,1419811200,,103,5.0588235294117645
8672218,4,B00MH26O86,"when I first popped this into the DVD player and it came on, I thought ""ugh, it looks cheaply made... it's gonna stink"" - BUT - I was wrong! I kind of like it!!!! I am a big Jillian Michaels, Tony Horton, Shaun T fan - so I like the big personality type of teachers. This girl, Lindsay, is cute and sweet (and from the south possibly?). (Her abs are amazing btw)
I thought I wouldn't appreciate her teaching style and that she was ""too basic"" but she mixes in pilates, planks, kickboxing, yoga and good old fashioned pushups and bicycle abs! I like that its a true total-body workout - not just cardio, not just abs, not just hand weights. She does it all and it's 30 minutes.
I gave it 4 stars only because I'm not dripping like with Shaun T and Insanity - but that's all cardio - you're supposed to be all sweaty. She makes you move, she makes you tone and you will work up a mild sweat.
There are two workouts (wish there were more to prevent boredom) and there is a beginner, intermediate and advanced level within each video. I might think this is ""too easy"" for a die-hard exerciser, but for an intermediate (and definitely a beginner) you will enjoy adding it to your workout DVD rotation. I am going to look for other videos by this girl. :)",1418342400,7,1249,4.274261603375527
8672219,4,B00MH26O86,"Lindsey is likeable & easy to follow.  2 half hr. workouts.  One advanced & 1 beginner to follow, Lindsey intermediate.  Cheesy set.  Not too strenuous compared to Jillian or Bob Harper but good for those days when can't face a hard workout.  I liked it for a change of pace, and that she uses a lot of kickboxing moves.",1417996800,5,320,4.3559322033898304
