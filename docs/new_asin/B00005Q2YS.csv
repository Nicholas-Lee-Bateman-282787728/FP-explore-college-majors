1644415,4,B00005Q2YS,"I won't give you a long, windy synopses of the movie.  I won't wax poetic about the symbolism found within Bride of the Wind, or discuss the social ramifications of such a flick.  I won't even bore you with a protracted discussion about the technical aspects of filmaking in relation to this film or the accuracy of the historical details.
Frankly, who cares about all that?  You just want to know whether or not you should buy/rent this movie.  My answer is YES.  If you like haunting love stories and tales of human drama, like Immortal Beloved or The Red Violin, you will enjoy this film.
If you are an avid scholar of art and history of this time period, you may find some inaccuarcies with which to pick the film apart.
But, the bottom line, it is a highly worth watching film.  I viewed it for the first time eighteen months ago, and scenes are still vivid in my mind.
Oh, and I noticed Amazon compared this to Iris.  NO WAY!  This film is not nearly as dreary and depressing as Iris.  True, there are some emotionally charged scenes in this movie, but they hardly compare to the torturous tale of a brilliant woman slowly losing her mind.",1043020800,6,1145,4.440191387559809
1644416,5,B00005Q2YS,"I may be too generous with the star-rating, but this is merely personal.  I have been a Mahler devotee for so long and know the music very well.  I have read several books on the Life and Times of the Mahlers and have visited Vienna many times.  I know the art of Moll, Klimt and Kokoscka from repeated visits to the galleries housing them.  So, to see the characters portrayed on screen somehow humanised them for me and inspired me to reread, to re-listen and to now concentrate my studies on Alma Mahler.
Whilst I agree that the film may not be 'unforgettable' it will touch the hearts of the lovers of Vienna, music, art and even the coffee houses as it did mine.  I am so happy to be the owner of this DVD.  What I do miss, perhaps, are some 'the making of...'scenes, but no matter.  If your heart is in the right place and you love music, go for it.  The appearance of Rene Fleming singing an Alma Mahler composition was just superb!",1042243200,7,939,4.295454545454546
1644417,4,B00005Q2YS,"I am writing this review to balance the incredibly negative reviews
I have read about ""Bride of the Wind."" I read the reviews before and
after seeing the movie, and I am aghast at what I've read - reviewers
who happily give 4 (out of 4) stars to (I won't say it) like ""Breaking the
Waves"" and ""Signs"" give this 1/2 star. Or how about ""Fargo"" and ""The Big
Lebowski?"" I think it's a travesty, and I wonder if there isn't some agenda
that big-budget movies with top stars have to be reviewed favorably for the
reviewer to be ""in,"" while a movie like this can be trashed so unfairly. ""Bride
of the Wind"" deserves more merit than most movies if for no other reason than
it attempts to seriously portray the life of one of the 20th century's finest
(opera) conductors/composers, though here obviously focusing on his talented,
beautiful, outspoken, sometimes even callous wife, who indeed has numerous
affairs before, during (!), and after his death. Clearly the moviemakers focus
on Alma because she outlives Mahler by more than 50 years, and has a more
""racey"" life.
 I've been a fan of Mahler's symphonies for years, and I felt that the
producers of ""Bride of the Wind"" correctly chose to focus the bulk of the
movie on Mahler and Alma. I found the performances of the actors who played
the great composer and his wife more than acceptable, though not for a moment
would I call them ""perfect."" I was pleased with the selection of some of Mahler's
symphonies and songs (though the musician who recommended the movie to me said
that the conducting sequences were very poor!). I enjoyed Alma's frankly saying
what many have felt about Mahler's long, operatic-like symphonies when they first
met - that is a topic of its own, for sure, though Mahler has won out over time,
thanks to supporters like the greats Bernstein and Shostakovich. If not, perhaps
no one would have ever made this movie. I also thought that the movie did a good
job of portraying the tensions in the Mahlers' marriage, the problems Mahler had
because he was a Jew who had to convert to Christianity to advance his career, the
outspokeness of Alma, as well as the tragic death of one of their daughters
(foreshadowed well and accurately during a scene when Alma asked Mahler why he
was composing music that sounded so tragic, when their lives were going so well).
I could go on and on praising what I felt were the good parts of this, the bulk
of the movie. The cinematography was also very well done throughout and realistic.
The lines for the minor players were for the most part well written and acted.
 Indeed after Mahler died Alma went on to a number of relationships
with artists of the highest talent, and I won't argue that this part of
the movie was as well done as her time with Mahler. But few movies, especially
movies that attempt to deal with complex lives and issues as this one, are perfect,
and other than the weird portrayal of the architect who became her second husband
(and who knows if the man wasn't as depicted in his personal life?), I found
the performances decent. The actor who played the passionate, expressionist painter
who somehow survived after being shot and bayonneted in WWI did a superb job.
 I must repeat, ""Bride of the Wind"" is maybe only a slightly above
average movie, but compared to the big-budget nonsense that praise
prostitution, misrepresent aliens and crop circles, trite ""who dunnits,""
to say nothing of the gore and violence that are the mainstay of Hollywood
fare, the movie is easily worth watching (and enjoying) in my opinion.",1039305600,18,3547,4.653907496012759
1644418,4,B00005Q2YS,"Although ""Bride of the wind"" focused on the romantic adventures of Vienna's renowned femme fatale Alma Mahler, it also provided us with interesting data on such famous artists as Gustav Mahler, Oskar Kokoschka, Franz Werfel etc... The cinematography could be considered a bonus, but what I particularly enjoyed was the charming music score. On a side note, this was Sarah Wynter's first leading role after ""Lost Souls"", ""6th Day""..., and her European-style beauty was quite fascinating -- especially in the steamy love scenes (...) Only after watching this movie did I look up Ms. Wynter's profile on IMDB to realize she was born in Newcastle, Australia. Another pleasant surprise.",1031184000,7,681,5.256880733944954
1644419,2,B00005Q2YS,"Folks, i wanted this movie to work.  The austrian art scene of that era was very interesting, and fireworks should have sparked.
I'm not sure if it was the screenplay or the editing which failed here.  Period pieces can succeed when executed well (i.e. Merchant/Ivory productions) and being helmed with a firm director's hand. Alas, the film only succeed in its parts and not as a whole.

Regardless, its always good to see Jonathan Pryce, and the Perez character seemed to walk in from a far more interesting production going on somewhere else down the street.",1016496000,3,561,4.822916666666667
1644420,4,B00005Q2YS,"Personally, I liked the movie.  I enjoyed the charecters.  I felt they were portrayed with much depth.  I enjoyed Sarah Wynter and I enjoyed Jonathan Pryce.  This movie appealed to my sense of creativity.  Not having read anything regarding Alma Mahler, the movie inspired me to seek out her autobiography.  I felt her marriage to Gustuv Mahler was her foundation for her success.  His love for her was unconditional and although he was shown to be somewhat selfish, he was also very understanding of his wife's actions.  That type of love is irreplaceable.  I felt the series of relationships after Mahler were simply wrong choices with the exception of Franz Werzel.  He was seen as a man who appreciated her talents and her beauty and supported her in kind.",1011484800,2,760,4.821705426356589
1644421,3,B00005Q2YS,"There once was a woman named Alma Mahler, wife of the composer Gustav Mahler.  After his death she either bedded or married some other well-known men in the Austrian artistic community in the early part of the 20th century.  This film is about her life and loves.
Sarah Wynter, a very pretty Australian actress is cast as Alma.  She wears some beautiful clothes but her acting is wooden.  Perhaps it is the script, but she never came across as real.  In fact, the real Alma became a well-known sculptor and did compose some minor works, but some of the dialogs about her ambitions seem a little too politically correct for their time and place.  And the film was more about the men in her life than it was about her own accomplishments.  Jonathan Pryce, cast as Gustav Mahler, does a fine job as the older husband who adores his young wife, mourns the death of one of their daughters, and composes brilliant music.  The score contains a lot of Mahler's music, which should satisfy the music lovers.
The best part of the film, however, is the costumes and the sense of Austria prior to WWI.  It's a festive and joyful place, full of music and art and parties and beautiful clothes.  I got a sense of the place in a very real way.  Too bad the characters were one-dimensional and belonged in a soap opera.  The romances, while sometimes quite steamy, never quite seemed real.  I can only give this film a lukewarm rating.  It was pleasant, and nice to look at.  And I did get a sense of a little bit of history.  But you won't be missing anything if you don't see it.",1008374400,6,1565,4.43859649122807
1644422,5,B00005Q2YS,"I was lucky enough to see this movie during the one week it spent here in New Orleans, and I knew to look for it because six months earlier a fellow art/music/film/eccentric lifestyles maven had alerted me to it.
  What I know about the life of Alma, I know from the film, so I cannot judge its veracity with historical accuracy-- although I am familiar with all of her lovers and husbands'  work. I thought it was thoroughly enchanting-- here is why:
  It is set in one of my favorite periods of European history, the fin-du-siecle up to post WWI, and the costumes and settings alone are truly gorgeous. Gustave Klimt makes an extended supporting appearance here; the immersion of the intelligentsia and high society in the aesthetic and cultural ideas of each period are ubiquitous. The art direction and research were masterfully undertaken; the light that appears in this film, both outdoor and indoor, contributes effectively in every scene. It is rare indeed that I am so aware of the light itself in a film as a primary ""actor"". From scenes set in elegant halls, to a sanatorium, to boulevards, to Oscar Kokoschka's wonderful studio, the sets alone inspire my admiration.
  But of course that is not enough to sustain a movie-- the story here is a basic one: Alma Mahler was a woman of intelligence and artistic gifts who was continually put in the position of aesthetic concubinage because of her beauty and skill at the ""feminine"" role. The notion of a woman being needed to be ""The Muse', the inspiratrix of Art, has not only been historically popular with (male) artists but has by definition precluded the active expression of said woman's talents.
  There are women (and men) who even today suborn their inner ""genius"" in order to serve as the helpmeet to someone else's ability and career, while the inner creator within them becomes stifled from lack of expression. Alma did this with three men in succession, all of whom, while acknowledging her abilities, felt that her talents were only in evidence to be of service to them. Only her fourth husband, Franz Werfel, appears to have been secure enough both in his masculinity and his position as an artist to have encouraged her to revive her efforts on her own behalf. The movie closes with one of Alma's pieces debuting (soprano Renee Fleming sings) for the first time.",1007164800,40,2336,4.776674937965261

The lead actress is just stunningly gorgeous -- she provides a restrained performance as Alma, and gives a sense of what kinds of compromises smart, attractive women had to make in their lives.

The relationships with the men are complex -- and she does seem to run through a number of them before finding a writer who was captivated by her musical talent and encouraged it. The other men seemed mostly to be captivated by her other charms and did not do much to nurture her creative and independent spirit. I liked it -- and am disappointed that the actress (Sarah Myles) hasn't made more films!",1316563200,,845,4.552631578947368
1644454,4,B00005Q2YS,"I have read all of the biographies of Alma Mahler including her autobiography. She was very free with the truth as well as with her virtue. The film sticks to the facts but takes Alma's view that she was potentially a great composer thwarted by Gustav's view that he needed support and felt threatened by her.
Her surviving songs show that she was a very minor composer far more interested in her sexual conquests than composing.
But you can't fault the acting and the settings of a decadent society filled with self-indulgent characters.",1304121600,2,538,4.795698924731183

At times the film can look quite well.  But the script is so banal that it invites parody.  And as Alma, a woman who fascinated a series of the greatest artistic figures of her time (and by no means only the three that she married), Beresford cast an Aussie ""girl next door"" who was pretty enough but projected not an ounce of charisma.  Perhaps the best spirit in which to watch this film is as a case study in how an experienced and frequently-successful director was able to get so many different things wrong in a single project.",1287273600,,678,4.663865546218488
1644456,4,B00005Q2YS,"Bruce Beresford's Bride of the Wind (VHS), is a film that dramatizes the life of Alma Mahler (Sarah Wynter), told against the backdrop of her successive marriages to composer Gustav Mahler (Jonathan Price), architect Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven), and novelist Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg), as well as her various affairs and friendships with other great creative men of the early 20th century, e.g., the artist Oskar Kokoschka (played by Vincent Perez).

In general, I enjoyed this artistic film. The cinematography is stunning and (I think) appropriately conveys the overall feel of the early 20th century. The music (especially excepts from Gustav Mahler's Symphonies Nos. 3, 5 and 6, and some examples of Alma Mahler's songs performed by Rene Fleming, et al) is outstanding throughout. In general, the performances of the actors range from good to excellent; and the direction is quite good.

Needless-to-say, I'm not really sure of the historical accuracy of this movie. However, whether ""Bride of the Wind"" is intended to be considered as a `romance film', or a `historical drama', this presentation raises some unanswered questions in my mind; specifically:
1. Why did Alma agree to marry Gustav Mahler knowing that she would be required to give up her career as a composer? Specifically, according to this movie, Gustav told Alma `upfront' that she would be required to give up her career as a composer as a precondition for their marriage (i.e., `Gustav's music' would now be considered `Alma's music'); and she evidently consented.
2. Knowing that she felt that her talents were stifled in her marriage to Gustav Mahler, why did Alma repeatedly enter into other relationships wherein her talents would, indeed, again be stifled?

By the way, I've just begun to read the book that this movie is based on titled, ""The Bride of the Wind: The Life of Alma Mahler,"" by Susan Keegan. Right up front, the book postulates, and promises to explore, the following questions:
1. ""What unique quality did Alma have in order to attract and hold the attention of so many outstanding men for so long?""
2. ""What effect, if any, did she have on their work?""
3. ""Why, in the light of her early promise, did she have such a slender output as a composer (she published only fourteen songs in her lifetime, none dated after 1915)?""
Since the movie, itself, doesn't seem to explore these questions, I'm eagerly looking forward to reading this book! Once I finish the book I intend to watch (and enjoy) the movie again.",1284336000,5,2509,4.983293556085919
1644457,3,B00005Q2YS,"Bride of the Wind as far as I am aware, had no cinema release after being viciously savaged by critics (see 'Rotten Tomatoes').  As well as my DVD copy, I was fortunate to attend a cinema screening presented by Director Bruce Beresford and to briefly discuss the movie afterwards with him.  I said that I found the film to be a 'quite OK' biopic and was surprised at the critics' treatment.  I thought a slow release night gather speed via word of mouth, but the response was that no distributor would take the risk.  I consider that the critics are wrong.",1270684800,,556,4.475247524752476
1644458,2,B00005Q2YS,"Alma Schindler apparently acted as a muse for some of the great creative minds of fin-de-siecle Vienna.  Artist Gustav Klimt, composer/conductor Gustav Mahler, artist Oskar Kokoschka, architect Walter Gropius and novelist Franz Werfel flit around the charming Alma like so many moths to a flame. Nonetheless, in Bruce Beresford's 2001 film ""Bride of the Wind"" (the title of one of Kokoschka's uber-passionate masterpieces which featured Schindler) Australian actress Sarah Wynter's one-note performance does little to illustrate to the viewer just why the glamorous Ms. Schindler exuded such immense appeal.

In ""Bride of the Wind,"" we get the impression early on that the highly-sought-after Alma loves playing consort to Vienna's intellectually famous. With an amazing level of self-confidence and assuredness, she puts all those famous gold-digging wannabes from the Housewives of Orange County and Co to 21st century shame.  Alma enjoys mining cerebral power that she harnesses for her own pleasure with a Teutonic efficiency that puts the ""p"" in passionless.  Initially we watch the flirtatious teen collecting famous brains cavorting with notorious letch and Secessionist movement founder Gustav Klimt against step-father Carl Moll's wishes, stealing kisses while tinkling on the piano with composition tutor Alexander von Zemlinsky and indulging in soulful discussions with her actress mother regarding the whys and wherefores of marriage. Alma aspires to be a great composer and works diligently on her scores in spite of urges from parents and friends to do what suits women of her station best: a concentration more on society and less on music.  Despite the feminist theme, Alma's calm, cool and collected machinations nail her the ultimate prize in yesteryear's Millionaire's Club--the esteemed yet misunderstood Gustav Mahler, nineteen years her senior.

Jonathan Price's Mahler seems a true portrait of the tortured genius, although the emphasis is sadness rather than maniacal energy.  Forced to renounce his Jewish origins to obtain position, he seethes with inner demons that Alma has no problem growing into full-sized devils--first by pushing her desire to compose herself, acting bored with his reclusive lifestyle and culminating with a wild affair with architect Walter Gropius that she meets while spa-ing in Styria.

Once Mahler kicks the bucket, Alma moves on to other lovers in particular Oskar Kokoscha (Vincent Perez), but we never get a sense from where her wanderlust with regard to love actually stems.  The film suggests that all that itchiness comes from a desire to compose but that theme is not really developed until Franz Werfel enters stage right and tells her with piano accompaniment what she needs to hear regarding her musical ego. We never understand Alma's sensibilities or philosophy; we are not privy to what they are.  We don't know if she was simply promiscuous or the epitome of fin-de-siecle modernity as propelled by the new sex-motivation thoughts of Sigmund Freud.

Whatever the case, Alma's life was definitely one interesting entanglement after another.  However, authentic costumes, lovely backdrops and a parade of famous lovers factor in positively but overall does not a good movie make. The extra depth that should be present--psychological motivations that make sense of all the absurd passion between Alma and her various lovers is noticeably absent and cannot redeem a vacuous but otherwise lovely-to-look-at costume drama.

Bottom Line?  ""Bride of the Wind"" almost mechanically relays about twenty years of Alma Schindler Mahler Gropius Werfel's life.  Ms Wynter plays the lead with a cold robotic intensity that makes it tough to understand why Alma was such a belle of the ball.  Wynter's slight almost gaunt sizing is reminiscent of Keira Knightly's uncomfortable display of wig balancing in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duchess/dp/B001L57ZZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duchess</a>""--instead of the expected voluptuous femme fatale we get a focus on Wynter's moue of perpetual intellectual disappointment framed by an upsweep of auburn hair.  Recommended only as a jumpstart to your own intellectual foray into the world of fin-de-siecle Vienna.

1644479,4,B00005Q2YS,"Welcome to the life of Alma Mahler, literally enslaved by Gustav Mahler who did not realize it, but Alma could not cope with it, just submit and suffer. Then she had a passion for Walter Gropius with whom she will eventually marry but the passion will vanish as soon as the wedding will be consumed, or nearly. She will have some liaison with Oskar Kokoschka, before and after Gropius, but that will only lead to drama, even melodrama.

Finally she will fall for Franz Werfel who did not come out of the drabness of the setting too much and more or less kept up with appearances. Alma Mahler may have had some potential but we will never know. She never really performed as a performer, a pianist it could have been, and it is not some seven or so songs published quite later that can tell us what she could have done in music if she had not been stifled by the fame of her husband and then the grandiose vision of her next two men.

But the film does not show well enough how she was the real inspirer of Gustav Mahler, the woman who gave him the courage to renege his religion to capture the director's position at the Vienna opera. He will never survive this killing of not only his God, but of God altogether, and when he found out he had killed God he discovered in the wake of this realization that life was dead and that death had invaded life completely and that only the earth was left, the earth on which we tread before being buried in it. Earth the perpetual and eternal shroud. The death of their younger daughter, Maria, was probably the straw that broke the camel's back.

He had to accept the call from the earth, from death and go into total darkness now the gate of light that does not cast a shadow was dead, had been killed along with God. That feeling of death, of absolute voidness and vacuum in the world, is so Jewish and yet so beyond Jewishness. That's probably what Alma could not stand up to, the constant contact with death that is so typical of Mahler's music. And now we have re-discovered the music of the Old testament, the Hebraic music codified and organized by King David, we can compare and we can discover its main accents are the same as some of the darkest music pieces Gustav Mahler composed.

His wife was just fascinated by this morbidity she felt in the music and could not identify, and that fascination became a sense of duty after she had fallen into the snare and then, when the snare released her, she could never free herself from that call from the bottom of the grave of life itself. This particular film sets the emphasis on the fragile uncertainty of Alma's successive passions that lead to some kind of melodramatic approach and that does not satisfy my real curiosity and consciousness about this world in which Mahler committed the worst crime possible, to kill his own people's God.

And God knows history was going to make his people pay for that assassination, which was not only Gustav Mahler's. Maybe it was a crime committed by a whole civilization and imposed in a cathartic way onto the Jews by this civilization turned materialistic.

But - the script is poorly written; it seems as though the author found a collection of quotes by the various characters, and then set out to write a movie about Alma, casting her as a victim.

But Alma was no victim - she was beautiful, intelligent, and in possession of an innate ability to attract men of the highest caliber - and she wasn't afraid to use it.

Ms. Wynter completely fails to capture the wit and intelligence of Alma, and as a result, she comes off more like a fin du siecle version of Paris Hilton.

1644482,4,B00005Q2YS,"""Bride of the Wind"" is a very appropriate description of Alma Schindler Mahler, the wife of Gustav Mahler.  Like the wind, Alma was really never able to settle down, always moving from one man to another.

This breathtakingly beautiful and consummately coquettish woman was married to:  Gustav Mahler, the composer, Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus architect, and Franz Werfel, the novelist.  Between and during these marriages, she found time for many real and rumored affairs with such artists as Gustav Klimt, Alexander Zemlinsky, Oskar Kokoschka, and many others.

A fascinating life, to be sure, and a perfect subject for a movie.  And now, the pluses and minuses:

Negative:

  It appears that an over-zealous militant feminist has tried to turn Alma the playboy or playgirl of Vienna into a victim.  They portray Gustav Mahler as crushing Alma's artistic creativity, and stifling her advancement as a composer.  True--Mahler warned her that she would be marrying a man for whom Music came first--unfortunately even ahead of his wife.  But knowing this, she still eagerly married him.  The sad facts of history are that, as a composer, she really wasn't very good.  She wrote many songs, some sonatas and other musical works, but they simply were not remarkable.  Her teacher Zemlinsky told her so, and she admitted it herself numerous times in her diaries.

Positive:

The scenery, costumes, and acting are beautiful and excellent.  Sarah Wynter is stunningly attractive, which helps demonstrate why so many famous men were attracted to Alma.

Some might argue that Wynter (Alma) just walks through the story as each new lover takes his turn in trying to win her.  Yet that is essentially what Alma Mahler's life was really like.  Every man who met her couldn't resist her.  She enjoyed being the quintessential flirt, and she was great at it!

If she never acheived her own artistic possibilities, perhaps it was because she was too occupied with falling in love.

a Caution:  (or maybe this is another positive) There are some steamy love scenes and some nudity, but they do all seem appropriate.",1144281600,7,2100,5.049562682215743

Badinage crammed full of interminable, moronic name-dropping (""Alma, meet Franz Werfel."")?  Check.  Endless parade of lifeless dialogue scenes lumbering through beautiful rooms?  Check.  Passionate heroine who inspires the hero (or a multitude of 'em, in this case) to invent that serum/write that symphony/paint that masterpiece?  Check.  Nude romps on the Beautyrest to the accompaniment of some potted version of classical music?  Check.  Frequent dialogue updates to ground us in history (""The Archduke's been shot in Sarajevo!  By TERRORISTS!!"")?  Check.  And in the center of all this ennui plods Sarah Wynter, a pretty, unremarkable Australian actress, giving a pretty unremarkable performance here as Alma.  As the decades crawl by for Our Heroine (and, seemingly, the audience, as well), she changes hairstyles and dresses, but never expressions.  Too old at the beginning of the film, too young at the end, and not satisfactory in the middle.  Were the real Alma this boring, she'd never have made it past her neighborhood coffeehouse.  The usually reliable director Bruce Beresford comes a real cropper here.",1118016000,14,1303,5.376237623762377
1644485,4,B00005Q2YS,"This is a very enjoyable movie. It doesn't delve deeply into Alma's life and there are a few historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie shows Gustav Mahler conducting his Symphony No. 8 and inserts text saying it was in 1910 at Carnegie Hall in New York City -- that is incorrect; Mahler gave the premier performance of his Symphony No. 8 in Munich, not New York City. So, the historical research behind this movie, while generally okay, is superficial. But it is a movie and much of what it says about her relatioships with these geniuses is accurate. I would have preferred the sound track to more accurately convey Mahler's music rather than the serious editing and watering down that was done here to supposedly fit more as background sound. But I did very much like the way Mahler's Adagietto from his 5th Symphony was used as background to the Mahler/Gropius/Alma scene where Alma was forced to choose between Gustav and Gropius -- very poignant. I recommend this movie, though keeping in mind that some of what is presented is not that accurate.",1073001600,14,1057,4.781420765027322
1644486,3,B00005Q2YS,"Filmmakers who attempt biopics -- lives of the great and near-great -- face a daunting task. Great creative souls are not like you and me. Their lives are usually filled with the kind of ambition, arrogance, dedication to art (and themselves), and personal tics that make them poor dinner companions. But anyone setting out to make a movie -- an inherently popular medium -- will soon feel pressured to fashion characters with whom we can sympathize, even identify. Hence the weaknesses in ""Bride of the Wind.""
Alma Mahler Gropius Werfel either married, or had affairs with, half the great creative men of early 20c. Vienna (thank you, Tom Lehrer!) What did she have that they all wanted? To find out, you'll have to look elsewhere. This film's Alma never reveals the passion, intelligence, and wit that got her Gustav and Walter and Franz. Instead, the movie implies that she gets Mahler interested in her by making a few insulting (and shallow) remarks about his music.  When their relationship begins to cool, it's because, among other things, he's been forgetting her birthday.
Mahler himself comes off as an odd combination of diffidence and arrogance; onscreen he displays little of the legendary manic energy and hyperemotive behavior that made his performances at the Court Opera seem revolutionary.  I guess the director wanted to stress, in conventional screenplay terms, that he was an Older Man. Even the music he conducts onscreen is taken at a geriatric pace, slower than any of the great recordings of those scores.
Things pick up once Alma moves on to Gropius, and especially when she takes up with Kokoschka and Werfel. Yet a kind of dusty solemnity continues to hang over the proceedings, aided by the beautiful but underlit settings and some very pedestrian dialogue.  Renee Fleming fans will enjoy the last scene, and so will folks who enjoy parodies of ""American Graffiti.""
For music aficionados only:  The guy with the bald head in several scenes is Arnold Schoenberg, a genius whose wildly unconventional music helped form the basis of 20c. classical style. Unless I fell asleep (and I may have), he doesn't get to utter a single word. I consider that symptomatic of the whole movie's effort to turn these tortured souls into Ordinary People.",1070064000,15,2265,4.984126984126984
1644487,4,B00005Q2YS,"I stumbled upon this film knowing that it was based on Alma Mahler, the woman who was married to classical composer Gustav Mahler. Since Mahler is a huge fascination of mine, I was compelled to watch this film. While Gustav Mahler seemed to be the central focus of the story in the first half, Alma Mahler gets more of the spotlight during the second, which makes this seem like two different films.
Like another reviewer stated, if you're a history/research buff, you may notice some loopholes or inaccuracies within the story. However, I'm guessing that this wasn't really intended to be epic material. Other than that, the film is quite artistic, beautiful and seductive. In the first half of the movie, it was nice to see Mahler (played by Jonathan Pryce) conducting parts of his 5th symphony, and some of his other pieces, while gaining a little bit of insight into the personality and thought-processes of the composer, however accurate they were. Some of those scenes were painful to watch (especially when Mahler found out he had heart problems, and he was going to die.) Elsewhere, like the critic said on the page, Sarah Wynter as Alma, had a seductive air about her, as she portrays a woman with talent, lust, passion and heartache. Some of the love scenes in here were quite steamy as well.
Overall, if you have interest in Gustav Mahler, Alma Mahler or any of the other historical figures involved in the story, I'd recommend that you view this. Despite not being the most serious or epic of documentaries, there's more than enough ear and eye candy to keep you fascinated.",1056672000,19,1586,4.7709090909090905
1644488,4,B00005Q2YS,"I must admit, I did rent this specifically to see Rene Fleming (in her very first film role!).  My plan was to drudge through a boring movie so Fleming's appearance would make sense to me.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to abandon my plan when I found myself not falling asleep, but heavily engrossed in this fascinating and compelling story!  First off, Sarah Wynter, an unfairly neglected talent!  What a committed and involved actress!  She was totally dedicated to this woman.  You could tell that she researched this woman's life and throughout the filming, really BECAME Alma in the process.  Simple mature sophistication in her acting all the way -- a class act.  Gregor Seberg, who plays Franz Werfel gives a convincing portrayl of his wonderful funny charming character.  Big kudos to Vincent Perez who plays Oskar Kokoschka.  Oskar has a lot of depth and Perez captures this extremely convincingly!
The story kinda drags in the beginning but eventually creates a compelling plot.  I thought Alma was written so so well.  She was such a developed character and person.  I grew to really like her.
And of course, Rene Fleming was spectacular.  Such a round, rich, velvety cream chocolate of a voice.  Too bad there's less than 10 minutes of her.  However, I'm such the movie's soundtrack has more.
I thought this movie was good.  It didn't change my life or anything, but it was very good.  Out of a 5.0, I give it at 4.0.",1055203200,4,1436,4.7682926829268295

7949689,3,B00005Q2YS,"This is a very sad film. It is about the very good composer, Gustav Mahler, a man whose music I like, who mistreated his wife Alma very badly. Mahler loved music. He loved to compose and to lead an orchestra. He was willing to give up his religion, Judaism, so that he could do so, for the anti-Semitic people of Germany and Austria would not let a Jew lead an orchestra. He was not alone in having to give up Judaism to get ahead in his community. Nor was he alone in writing beautiful music while being a bad person. I think of Wagner whose music I like, but who was a vicious anti-Semite.
So engrossed in his music, although he married a beautiful, vibrant woman, who also composed, he insisted that she give up everything, including her own music, and devote herself entirely to him. As a result, as normal people would expect, she felt that he crushed her spirit, gave her pain, only used her, that he thought of nothing but his music. In the film, she even loses control and shouts at him, I hate you and your Jewish music, even though his music is not Jewish and actually more Wagnerian than anything else. As a result, unable to find fulfilment and happiness at home, Alma has affairs.
He is right, of course. His music is far better than his wife Almas music. But he was wrong, viciously wrong, tragically wrong, in the way he treated his wife. He should have recognized her as a human being, a person needing her own needs, and not stifled her and thereby forced her to seek happiness elsewhere.",1503187200,,1505,4.41726618705036

Alma and Gustav Mahler were two of the most fascinating and passionate people of their era, but these portrayals, along with the lacklustre script, hardly bring this out. The astonishing opening party scene, a decidedly decadent view of Vienna, suggests that what follows will be more like a Ken Russell film. Actually, Russell' film 'Mahler' also takes factual liberties, but is much more exciting and sympathetic to its subjects.",1458518400,,572,5.095744680851064
