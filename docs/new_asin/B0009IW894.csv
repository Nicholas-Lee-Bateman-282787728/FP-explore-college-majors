2294227,5,B0009IW894,"Season 3 was, IMO, the best of the entire series.  Almost every episode was a classic.  Everything worked: the writing, the acting, and the charisma of the stars.  First rate TV entertainment.  Note: notice how slim Larry Hagman is in the last few episodes.",1116720000,8,257,4.7727272727272725
2294228,5,B0009IW894,Dallas was always must see Tv back in the 80's. hard to believe it's been 25 years since who shot JR Ewing? talk about a Larger than life role? this was probably the Ultimate Dallas season&everything about the Show was in Prime&Peak feel&vibe. I can't wait to get this collection on DVD.I use to watch this show all of the time back in the day&this show is One of the Greatest ever IMO.the Whole Cast was on point.,1116720000,7,414,4.32051282051282
2294229,5,B0009IW894,"This is it, the season of Dallas where JR is shot, finally coming to DVD!  It's also considered by many to be the best year of the series, and it certainly is top notch.  With all the original cast members including Barbara Bel Geddes, Jim Davis, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Larry Hagman, Steve Kanaly, Ken Kercheval, Victoria Principal, and Charlene Tilton, it also was the first full season which the writers planned ahead of time to be a continuing serial, thus it flows and feels 10 times more like classic Dallas than season 1, which took a while to take off.  With announced special features including cast interviews about Who Shot JR, it's also sure to be a better DVD than the last one too.  Anyway, if you are an absolute Dallasatic like myself, you will need this DVD the day it comes out, and will have to rewatch every episode numerous times.  Also, though it's been said before, their numbering system stinks and this is really the 2nd season.  Just tape a piece of paper over the title that says second in your head.",1115337600,10,1030,4.54054054054054

2294250,5,B0009IW894,"I remember in 1980 and probably before, Dallas coming on every Friday night.  I was too young to get into the story line - but I knew the characters, I was curious about who shot JR and I would sometimes catch myself humming the theme as I played during the day.
After I was older and married I started watching them in Repeats on CMT I believe it was.
This was a series that I loved and was addicted to.  One I would watch over.
It had been a few years since i watched them, so I decided to buy my own set.  While I would have loved to have purchase the complete set, I decided to start buying 2 a month until I had the complete set.
While I won't say anything in this review that might be a spoiler to someone, I can say this is a must see tv series.
The first couple seasons are great, but everything is just falling into place in those.  They are showing you the story lines and the personalities.  This season I believe is going to get you hooked, if you aren't already.",1457654400,,975,4.057291666666667

2294296,5,B0009IW894,"remember watching this show as a kid....one of the all time best soaps of its era...larry hagmen was such an under rated actor...he could do physical comedy as well as drama and was born to play JR Ewing as Joan collins was Born to play Alexis Colby (i cried like a baby when he died) Linda Gray was also under rated as an actor she emerged from a behinds the scenes role in season 1 to really be given some meaty storylines and she rose to the occasion.....with all this said by season 9 they had run out gas and interesting characters, the writing,characters and storylines were no longer fresh or interesting(they really lost alot of credibility when they decided to make season 8 a dream just to bring bobby back).. ....Miss. Ellie and Clayton no longer fit or seemed to have a place by season 13...... the new dallas also has some very good talent and male eye candy and while the writing fits today's soaps it still lacks something for me and without a larry hagmen (JR. Ewing) you have no true dallas.",1406419200,,1008,4.454054054054054

She really likes the old Dallas TV show and these DVDs play great. They're packaged well, have episode descriptions, good color and sound, and very readable subtitles in English that we appreciate because the big TV set we watch is an old RCA analog and doesn't have close-captioning.

2294316,5,B0009IW894,This was one of my most favorite shows of this time.  The build-up when JR gets shot was award-winning.  I still love watching.  rest in peace JR.  Great acting !!!  It was fustrating because we had to wait atleast five more shows before we could find out who actually shot JR.  I kept thinking it was Sue Ellen.  Who would have thought it was her very own sister !!!,1380672000,,367,4.231884057971015
2294317,4,B0009IW894,"Betty Lou - Alan's girlfriend was played by the lady who played TERRY on Falcon Crest
Phillip - the lawyer from Falcon Crest - was a business colleague of JRs

I initially watched Dallas on a black and white tv so I was shocked to see all the flowers, panelling, and shag carpets from the 1970's and 1980's during the episodes. I mean the DECOR of the homes was horrible.  In addition, these people are RICH yet they have very small closets and I saw Ms. Ellie's clothes hanging on cheap wire hangers.

I loved the jeans though; I am looking for Gloria Vandervilts online as we speak.  I received the jeans and in person 1970's jeans don't look that good. LOL!

As for the episodes, SueEllen is dating Dusty Farlow.  Pam has decided not to have a child out of fear the child will develop neurofibromytosis.  I looked up this disease and it seems unlikely that Pam would have passed this on to a child.  Also, Pam and Cliff survived so they could have tried to have a child.  Furthermore, a surrogate could have been used.  I am not sure why the writers made such a big deal about pregnancy for women in the 1980's and 1990s on soap operas.  On Falcon Crest, they also took away Melissa's ability to have a child after she lost a child.

Cliff was controlling the OLM for a while which was driving the Ewings out of business.  JR then funded Cliff's campaign for Congress and then Cliff quit the OLM and Ewing Oil was back in business again.  Jock, however, had to be tried for a 28 year old murder.

JR is dating SueEllen's sister, Kristen.  Kristen thinks JR will leave SueEllen for her one day.

Ellie has breast cancer and loses a breast.  Jock has an ex-wife that is in a sanatorium. """"Are you going to leave me like you did AMANDA?""

My opinion: This was a good season, but the shooting was definitely overly hyped.  I find the show entertaining though.

NOTE: I bought my set BRAND NEW from Amazon.  Several of the discs were scratched and would not play.  I don't know who packaged these DVDs at the factory, but they clearly watched the DVDs before they packaged them.

Note 2: Amazon sent me a replacement set and these two sided DVDs get stuck in the player.  Netflix has them one sided (I think) so I likely will not buy anymore sets since they are double sided and cause issues for the DVD player.",1379635200,,2309,4.376470588235295
2294318,5,B0009IW894,"Purchased the entire season, and the transaction was as smooth as any other amazon purchase.  Sometimes it takes a little longer to load an episode: I pause it, go do something else, and when I come back it's ready to play all the way through.

2294332,5,B0009IW894,"Every Friday night back in the day I watched Dallas. It remains to this day the only soap opera I've ever watched in my lifetime. A nighttime soap opera in prime time with great (and cool) characters. Daytime soap operas? They're for girls. Those have dark, depressing rooms where some woman is sipping wine and talking about her ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex, ex husband. Dallas, on the other hand, was in prime time. It had J.R. Ewing, Bobby Ewing, Sue Ellen, Miss Ellie, Jock Ewing, etc. It was about Texans in the oil business. Lots of drinking, fighting, arguing, etc. Lots of good stories and drama unfolding. The whole ""Who Shot J.R.?"" thing was a national phenomenon. When you have a cast that has Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Victoria Principal, Barbara Bel Geddes, Patrick Duffy, Charlene Tilton, etc., you can't go wrong. This third season was awesome.

I highly recommend these Dallas DVDs. They'll bring back memories of when TV was actually good and watchable, rather than the crap that's on TV nowadays, like American Idol, The Bachelor/Bachelorette, and all the other crummy reality TV shows.",1364428800,,1138,4.747474747474747

While this season has the most intense and most talked about episode of the series, I still think that the show was just starting to find its groove; this was the breakout season for sure. Jock is as rugged and fiesty as ever, while Miss Ellie remains the pillar of strength for the family. J.R. is simply the wittiest and cockiest of them all, while Bobby is the peacekeeper. This is television drama at its finest. In a way, it's almost hilarious how the writers of the show come up with the craziest plots and their many twists. No family is perfect, but the Ewing's not only define 'dysfunctional', but take it to a whole new level. This third season is must-see TV.

The great thing about watching a show from the 1970s and 1980s is that no one has computers or cell phones....refreshing!

Just so that anyone interested is aware, Episode 18: Jenna's Return has an extremely long introduction (black screen).  I originally thought that the episode would not work; however, I accidentally discovered that it was just a long intro.  Every episode I had watched up until that point played fine.  When we got to it, we thought that it did not work.  After a few calls to tech support, they informed me that it was a ""bandwidth"" issue on my side.  That seemed ridiculous since every other single episode played fine.  Anyway, I happened to just let it ""play"" and after about 45-60 seconds, it just started playing and worked fine.  There are a few minor audio issues here and there throughout some of the episodes, but nothing that I can't tolerate.  It is overall good quality for something that was originally produced in the 1979-1980 range.  If not for those minor flaws, I would rate it five star, but that was enough for me to drop it one rating.

After an exciting introduction to the Ewing family at Southfork, a devestating tragedy struck right away, followed by high-stakes drama which included-in no particular order, mind you-power, greed, deception, domestic disputes, money and of course, women. The second season ended with an emotional cliff-hanger which had Sue Ellen nearly dying in the hospital while in labor.

The third season begins with a bang, and never lets up. The high-stakes drama and intrigue continue, with money, greed, women, deception, domestic disputes and even murder playing a hand. The writing, which was strong ever since the first episode and continued throughout the five-episode first season and the second season, only gets better during season 3.

2294369,5,B0009IW894,"**NOTE - This review contains major spoilers**

Perhaps one of the most famous seasons of ""Dallas"" for no other reason but the cliff-hanger finale where viewers all over the world were left with the million-dollar question, ""Who Shot J.R.?"".

Before we get to that milestone episode however, the Ewings and their friends and enemies have plenty of drama to endure.

The season begins with Sue Ellen's baby being kidnapped from the hospital; shortly after Pam gets pregnant a second time but loses the baby AGAIN, only to learn later in the season she may never be able to give birth to a healthy child due to a genetic disease she's inherited from Digger. As a result, she becomes strongly attached to baby John, until the neglectful Sue Ellen begins taking an interest in the child. Later, as Digger lay dying Pam discovers her real father was a ranch hand who was murdered and buried on Southfork thirty years prior. All of these emotional events take their toll of Pam and Bobby's marriage, and he pleads with her to help hold their union together.

Miss Ellie undergoes a mastectomy and grows distant from Jock when she learns he had a wife before her, whom he's been keeping in a mental hospital for the past 40 years.

Sue Ellen begins an affair with drifting cowboy Dusty whom she meets at the annual Ewing Rodeo. She begins trying to beat J.R. at his own game but only ends up back on the bottle with J.R. determined to have her re-comitted.

J.R. further alienates the family by mortgaging Southfork for a risky business deal and gets Cliff Barnes to resign from the Office of Land Management by secretly funneling cash into a phony campaign to get him elected to the State Senate. He also bribes slimy young hotshot Alan Beam to woo Lucy and get her off Southfork for good.

I was sorry to see David Wayne (the original Digger Barnes) replaced by Keenan Wynn this year. Wayne had landed a full-time gig on the Wayne Rogers/Lynn Redgrave sitcom ""House Calls"" and was much better in the role, IMO. Wynn seemed better-suited to comedic parts and I didn't care for his portrayal. I can say the same for Francine Tacker who appears as Jenna Wade. Tacker had big shoes to fill because she seemed so plain compared to the glamorous Morgan Fairchild, whose persona was tailor-made for prime-time soaps.

The one cast switch I was thrilled with was the arrival of Mary Crosby as Sue Ellen's sister Kristen (taking over from Colleen Camp). Of course, Kristen has a very pivotal role this season--luring J.R. into bed, getting him to put her up in an expensive condo and hire her on as his temporary secretary. The devious Kristen makes short work of using J.R.'s shady business dealings as ammunition. Despite her backstabbing ways, Crosby imbues the character with a vulnerability and desperation at times that made you feel for and relate to the character. Though she wasn't the best actress on the show, her unique beauty and engaging style made her the most interesting to watch.

The writers cleverly plot the scripts in the final third of the season so that any number of characters are motivated to point the barrel at J.R. and pull the trigger: Is it Sue Ellen, Allan Beam, Cliff Barnes, Kristen, Donna, Vaughn Leland? Of course, you have to buy Season 4 to find out.

The stories are even more engrossing that those in the S1-2 boxset, the picture quality on the dual-sided discs varies, and the sound is rather low, but I still highly recommend this third season of ""Dallas"".",1298246400,2,3485,4.689034369885434
2294370,5,B0009IW894,"Season three of ""Dallas"" began in the fall of 1979 where it rested comfortably on Friday nights on CBS where it became a Top 10 series. This is the year that led up to ""Dallas"" becoming a television phenomenon as every single character would be embroiled with the lead character of J.R. Ewing, the evil obnoxious son of the show's leads. Those characters would all be tied into the storyline known simply as ""Who Shot J.R.?"" when the final episode of the year aired on March 21, 1980. In the final moments of that episode J.R., while working late at night at Ewing Oil, is shot twice, falls to the floor, and is presumed dead. It was a shot known as ""heard around the world"".

 This season box set contains all 25 episodes on five discs, all double-sided. Bonuses include audio commentary by series stars Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray as well as the documentary ""Who Shot J.R.: The Dallas Phenomenon"".

 Unlike other primetime soaps of the '80's like ""Dynasty"", ""Knots Landing"", and ""Falcon Crest"", ""Dallas"" has seen all its 14 seasons released on DVD so purchasing this set is a wise investment.

 Cables' TNT station is currently in the process of filming a brand new updated pilot of ""Dallas"" and both Duffy and Gray are currently signed on board. Larry Hagman is in negotiations to reprise his role as J.R.. The series will mainly deal with the new generation of ""Dallas"" characters while still featuring the old leads. Miss Ellie and Clayton have passed on, Bobby has remarried, and Sue Ellen has become a powerful, strong, independent woman.

2294374,3,B0009IW894,"I love Dallas.  I am not giving the acting or actors a 3 but the season itself.  I just find this season rather boring. Other than just a few exciting moments and the ""who shot JR?"" I think the overall season is quite boring compared to the excitement the others have.  I usually can't wait to see the next episode and I am on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the set in a trance, but not with this season.  The first 8 episodes are really slow.  I expected this season to start of with a bang because how season 2 ended with Sue Ellen being in the crazy ward.

I grew up with Dallas but I am now looking at it as an adult.  My story on Dallas is that I found seasons 7 and 9 for 6 bucks each so I bought them and got hooked!!  I wanted to start from the beginning so I bought seasons 1&2 and loved it!  Seeing that there were so many seasons I knew I would end up spending a fortune so I started to check them out at the Library.  So I am so glad that season 3 was the one I got from the Library because I would be upset that I wasted my money.  Since they are at the Library I am going to keep on going because I have a feeling that season 4 is going to get back to more excitement.  Like I said before, the rating is on the season and not the actors or the disk themselves.",1267401600,,1285,3.789473684210526

2294376,4,B0009IW894,"I'm new to ""Dallas"" only having seen brief random snippets here and there up to now when it was syndicated on broadcast TV years ago and I was channel surfing.  I am now watching the DVDs from the very beginning.  So far, I believe this Season (called ""Season 3"" but really this is Season 2 since ""Season 1"" on DVD was in fact the miniseries) is a step down in quality.  Now video quality has definitely gone up compared to the prior season box set (colors are snappier and the video a bit sharper), instead I'm talking about a bit of a decline in the show as a whole.  Some people have applauded the cast changes made in this season, but I prefer the original versions of Kristen, Digger Barns and Gary Ewing.  The plots (writeres) now have the cast members also liking to talk to themselves in this season.  I don't think the shark has been jumped yet, but there is a bit of a letdown in my opinion, thus the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.

I got a brand new set of discs and yet disc 1 on both sides has several places where the show would stop entirely, yet the discs are physically pristine.  I checked on a brand new DVD player to determine this isn't a problem that can (almost always) happen with older players.  I also noticed this issue to a much lesser extent on a small part of one episode in Season 1/2.  Be warned, hopefully you won't have a problem.",1256774400,3,1361,4.24031007751938

No commercials obviously is a plus too with watching them on DVD.

2294379,5,B0009IW894,"This is the third season's worth of ""Dallas,"" CBS' classic prime serial, from 1979-80 (actually, it's the second full season's worth, but Warner calls it #3 for DVD release). In this season, the drama is ""kicked up a notch"" (as Emeril Lagasse would say), with stories ranging from the kidnapping of the Ewings' newborn son, to Ellie's mastectomy, to J.R.'s mortgage of Southfork. Even brother Gary gets in on the action, in a special Thursday episode that sets up ""Knots Landing,"" the long-running spinoff of ""Dallas"" that would run on Thursdays (although I'll say no more beyond that). Follow all of these stories through, as well as the others, and the dedicated viewer will eventually see where they lead-- like a long, dark tunnel, the light is at the end of that tunnel, in the form of the classic episode ""A House Divided."" In this one, the pieces of the puzzle finally fall into place. J.R. did so many bad things over the course of this season that someone (who it was, I cannot say; you'll have to see the first episodes of #4 to find that out) decides that he is too bad to live, and pumps two lead slugs into him while he is working late at night in his office. Again, we know why the deed is done, but over the summer and part of the fall, we'd have to wait to discover the perpetrator (because of an actors' strike that delayed the start of #4 until November). Even then, the mystery isn't solved until, I believe, episode 4 of #4.

This cliffhanger, and others like it, are what made ""Dallas"" one of the greats; the whole season is the road to the cliffhanger, and the cliffhanger leaves you practically hanging in suspense until the eventual resolution.

Now, onto the technical aspects. The video is generally pretty good, though it has a lot of film dust and specks in it, and the audio carries the stories across very well. The discs (4 doubles and 1 single) are packaged in a somewhat space-saving manner. Like the opening two-pack, the discs are in a digipak. The 4 doubles are stacked atop each other in overlapping trays, and the last disc, the single-sided disc that has the season finale, has a holder all its own on the right-hand side. The way that these discs are packaged (4 doubles on top of each other, and one single to the side) makes for a slimmer package than the opening two-pack, which had all 5 discs (all doubles) in a neat row. When the discs are removed, there is an image of the Dallas skyline under them. On the left-hand inside, there is a pocket that contains a fold-out pamphlet with episode listings, airdates, plots, and producer and director credits; the final episode is described on the back cover. The front image of this pamphlet sums up the major story of the season very well-- J.R., the victim of two gunshots to the chest, is laying on the floor of his office (though, like I said, we know why it was done, we had to wait until November of the following season to find out who did it).

As for bonuses, this season contains two. One is a documentary on the cliffhanger of J.R.'s shooting and what it meant to the series up to that point. A word of caution: If you're just coming into the series on DVD, I would recommend that you first see the episode that sets up the cliffhanger, and then the episodes of #4 that resolve the cliffhanger, then you can come back to the documentary if you want, see it, and then either continue with #4 or rewatch #3 (whichever). The reason why is because the documentary gives away the name of the perpetrator in J.R.'s shooting, and that would take all the fun out of discovering who shot him.

The other bonus is commentary on two episodes: ""Sue Ellen's Choice"" and ""A House Divided,"" the latter being the episode that sets up the cliffhanger. These commentaries are delivered by Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray. As for languages and subtitles, there is only English audio, but there are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. There are 6 chapter stops per episode-- one for the preview and opening titles, four for the body of the episode, and one more for closing credits. Because the first four discs are doubles, Warner Bros. has made it easy to tell which side you're on of which disc. If the side you're on has writing, that is side A; no writing, side B. This is better than double sets that have writing on both sides, thereby leading to confusion. One other thing is that the single-sider that has the cliffhanger setup episode has no labeling on it, and thus some people might mistake it for one of the doubles. The package is in somewhat of a teal-green color, probably representing the financial aspects of ""Dallas"" and the Ewings.

The menus are just like the opening two-pack, with the screen taking on the color of the package, a shot of the Ewing family on top, the ""Dallas"" title on the bottom-left, and the disc menu on the bottom right (with options for playing all episodes at once, choosing a random episode, and selecting languages and subtitles). There is one other thing that I did not like, and that is the fact that the disc menu always had an option for bonuses, despite the fact that the only bonuses are on the fourth and fifth discs. The miniseries opening theme plays in the background on the main menu screen only.

Overall, ""Dallas"" #3 is a well-made release from Warner Bros. of the third season's worth (actually, the second full season's worth) of one of television's classic serials, and comes highly recommended not only for content, but for presentation as well.",1232150400,,5494,4.5669371196754565

2294393,5,B0009IW894,watching this dvd set was great. I had forgotten how much went on in the lives of the Ewings. It was a regular night time soap opera of it's time. It was great fun to watch.,1178668800,,173,3.8333333333333335
2294394,4,B0009IW894,"Season Three of the long-running primetime soap opera Dallas featured quite possibly one of the busiest television seasons ever and featured what is called the greatest cliffhanger in television history in the final episode.

Of course throughout its run, Dallas was known for having great cliffhangers, but in season three, the writers and producers really hit the nail on the head. To someone who was watching the show in 1980, the final scene of the final episode of season three probably came as quite a shock. I knew what was going to happen and I was still a little taken aback. That's what great television is all about.

And season three completely plays up to that moment right from the start. With all the lying and cheating and backstabbing that take place, the writers are building viewers up so that when the big moment happens, it seems justified, yet at the same time, still comes as a shock.

The shooting of Ewing Oil president JR Ewing (Larry Hagman) created quite a buzz in the television world and when it was revealed who shot him near the beginning of season four, that episode ranked as one of the top-rated television shows of all time. But surely just about everybody would say that JR deserved the bullets.

In the age of the Internet and all other forms of information, even though I have never seen an episode of Dallas beyond the first three seasons on DVD, I know who shot JR, but I still will buy season four and get the inside track on just what he or she was thinking when pulling the trigger.

Season three certainly ran the gamut of emotions, with no time to stop and catch your breath. It began with the two part story about the kidnapping of JR and Sue Ellen's (Linda Gray) baby, John Ross Ewing III. With suspects aplenty, the Ewing Oil magnate's first thought turns to his brother in law, Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) who may or may not be the baby's father.

When the youngster is finally returned to the family, Sue Ellen becomes cold and detached from the child, while Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal) grows attached to the child after losing a baby of her own in a horseback riding accident. Sue Ellen continues to grow detached from John Ross and an affair with Dusty Farlow, who's family would come to play a huge part in future seasons, and trips to see a psychiatrist just estrange her more. As the season ends, the entire Ewing family is concerned about Sue Ellen's drinking and JR is ready to commit her to the sanitarium, much like he did in season two.

Bobby (Patrick Duffy) and Pamela Ewing have an up and down season, as they lose a baby and also have to deal with the fallout between her brother Cliff and the Ewing family. After Pamela loses the baby, she grows very attached to John Ross, which upsets Bobby as he wants to have a baby of his own. But unbeknownst to him, Pamela is scared that a disease she may carry could affect her child. She goes on a search for her mother when it is revealed that her father Digger is not really her father. As the season winds down, Bobby and Pamela are leaving Southfork after another of JR's schemes pushes Bobby over the edge.

Ewing matriarch Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes) faces a battle with breast cancer, which forces her to get a masectomy. She keeps everything to herself as she is afraid that the change in her life will stop her husband Jock (Jim Davis) from loving her. Jock also faces a tough fight from Miss Ellie when it is revealed that he was married before he met her and divorced his wife when she developed mental problems. Jock, JR, Bobby and ranch foreman Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly) go on a hunting trip that finds them being shot at and JR and Jock's lives at stake thanks to Jock's business tactics many years earlier when he still ran Ewing Oil.

Young Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton) is enrolled at college and starts dating a lawyer named Alan Beam (guest star Randolph Powell) who JR is using to set up Cliff Barnes. Lucy dates the young man mainly because she thinks JR hates him, but secretly, he and JR are working together to get Cliff out of the Office of Land Management. They become engaged as JR hatches a plot to get Lucy out of Dallas for good, but his plan backfires when Jock gets Alan a job in Dallas. Lucy also gets to spend time with her parents, Gary (Ted Shackleford) and Valene (Joan Van Ark) who also spin off into their own prime time soap opera Knot's Landing, during this season.

And of course JR. His biggest storyline of the season is his mortgaging of Southfork to finance oil wells in Asia, wells which strike it rich and become a boon for Ewing Oil. But nationalization of the Asian wells sends JR scrambling to sell off most of his shares to his ""Business partners,"" who in turn are dealt a staggering loss, giving any of them a motive to shoot him in the finale. He also has an affair with his wife's sister Kristin (guest star Mary Crosby), who plots with Alan Beam for revenge, giving both of them, as well as Sue Ellen, who he is planning on sending to a sanitarium, a motive to shoot him. It seems JR had a lot of enemies. No wonder the ratings were so high for the who done it show.

As for extras, this set has a couple of good commentaries with Linda Gray and Patrick Duffy, including on the ""A House Divided"" episode, the final cliffhanger at the end of the season. There is also a featurette on the show and its popularity, particularly in dealing with the cliffhanger of JR being shot.

All told, this was a great follow-up to a solid releas of the first two seasons. I never watched this show on television, mainly because I was too young, but I am thoroughly enjoying the episodes on DVD.",1153699200,4,5666,4.463768115942029

I discovered that this was going to be the season's cliffhanger, (while watching the documentary) but the network wanted more episodes for the year's season, due to the show's popularity and audience draw, for more commercial time to be bought.

2294414,5,B0009IW894,"Season 3 of 'Dallas' really had it all - tight, suspenseful writing, excellent actors, higher production values and a more general all-round sense of professionalism than before.

This DVD set is one of the finest examples of TV conversion that I own - the episodes are full, uncut and (for the most part) crystal-clear in audio-visual terms.

Reprising their roles as the Ewing clan, the main cast of characters is joined by a host of recurring extras - most notably Mary Crosby as evil Kristin, Joan Van Ark as wholesome Valeen and hot-as-hell Jared Martin as handsome Dusty Farlow. Also, for fans of camp, Joycelyn Brando (yes, Marlon's sister) can be seen here as JR Ewing III's nursemaid - she was also Barbara Bennett in camptastic movie 'Mommie Dearest'.

While there are more excellent moments in this season than can be put down in a single review, here are some particularly good points:

Barbara Bel Geddes: Although not as prolific in the first two seasons, Bel Geddes' Emmy was thoroughly deserved for her performance in Season 3 of 'Dallas'. Her 'Mastectomy' two-parter is every bit as powerful and relevant today as it was originally. She's a brilliant, brilliant actress and one without whom 'Dallas' certainly wouldn't have had the balance that it did.

Linda Grey: Breaking out of the mold of dutiful alcoholic, and not yet in the mold of adulterous alcoholic, Linda Grey's crescendo portrayal of a woman coming to terms with postpartum depression and a lousy husband is spellbinding. Another great actress breathing likable life into a thoroughly dislikable part.

Larry Hagman: Nobody does Evil better. Not even Joan Collins at her most Alexisesque could outshine the genius talent of Larry Hagman. How, tell me, do you take the character of JR Ewing and actually manage to generate sympathy in the audience? I don't know, but Hagman certainly does that.

The return of Gary Ewing (again!), the paternity of baby JR Ewing III, the Digger-Barnes feud, the Southeast Asia oil deals.... Season 3 grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you in, and doesn't let go until the final climactic cliffhanger. It's worth the ride, oh, so worth it - and you'll be amazed at how good 'Dallas' actually is. In terms of acting and writing, nothing today can touch it.

A word to the wise: If you buy this box set, buy it with Season 4. You'll HAVE to see the season cliffhanger resolution :-)",1141257600,,2394,4.8504901960784315

A BIG thank you to Warner Home Video. Please keep these Dallas seasons coming quickly.

Now to my review of DALLAS Season 3. DALLAS is the best drama ever from the 80s, which is why it was number 1 in the Nielsens during most of its first seven seasons. I thoroughly recommend this DVD. You'll get hooked on this TV show, which, in my opinion, is better quality drama than today's primetime soaps.

After waiting frustratingly for ONE year for this season 3 DVD release, I am delighted that one of the best seasons of DALLAS is out on DVD. This was the season that put DALLAS on the map, so to speak, and turned it into a phenomenal worldwide success and made ""J.R. Ewing"" a household name. 300 million people around the world heard the shot in 1980 when the dastardly J.R. Ewing, with all his malice in Dallas, got his comeuppance in the season finale ""A House Divided"", which is ranked as one of the most watched episodes in TV history. DALLAS was that big!

In season 3 every episode is a classic and each has ingenious plots and storylines and are all well written. The actors do a fine job of portraying their characters convincingly. Jim Davis, aka Jock Ewing, has a strong on-screen presence which you don't often see in actors on other shows. And Bing Crosby's daughter, Mary Crosby, is great as Kristin who makes this season extra special!

DALLAS has 14 seasons and we DALLAS fans hope Warner will now be releasing the seasons much quicker on DVD. Thanks!",1129680000,6,1671,4.4983498349834985

2294419,5,B0009IW894,"The third season of Dallas had viewers all around the world posing the famous question ""Who Shot JR?"" by the cliffhanger in 1980. Indeed JR had done some despicable deeds this season to push those around him to such extremes. Viewers had to wait until that fall to find out who the assailant was. This season definately changed the face of Dallas the series. Before it held respectable ratings, this cliffhanger definately pushed it to the top for years to come. No cliffhanger though compared to this one.

It's not a great season just for the cliffhanger. The build up is what makes this watchable. Pamela and Bobby faced many problems in their marriage this season as Pamela found out that she had a neurodegenerative disease which could prevent her from having children. She also lost her father, and ultimately pushed Bobby away for these reasons. JR and Sue Ellen's volatile relationship took many turns as Sue Ellen started having an affair with Dusty and tried to distance herself from JR. Even Ellie and Jock faced problems in their marriage after Ellie found out that Jock had lied and had in fact been married before he wed her. Ellie also discovered she had breast cancer. Lucy fell in and out of love with Alan Beam, who JR had hired to take down Cliff Barnes. Ray also fell in love, with Donna.

Just a general overview, there were tons of great moments, lots of tears, and more. The third season of Dallas remains as one of the best in the show's 13 year history.",1128297600,3,1478,4.61596958174905
2294420,5,B0009IW894,"Dallas Season 3 has no shortage of backstabbing deals, illicit love affairs and melodrama.  This was the season that cemented Dallas's spot in the ratings an caused countless millions to ask the question, ""Who shot JR?""  I enjoyed every episode of it from the first to the last.  Some of the storylines were simply delicious and I spent many a night glued to my DVD player eagerly waiting to see what happens next.  I think the best thing about these box sets is that we get it all; the entire season in one big viewing marathon and we don't have to wait till next week to see what happens .  JR of course is the driving force and most of the storylines centre around him.  I think the business subplots are the best and clearly show how far JR is willing to go to meet his ends.  I have to say however unlike it's counterpart ""Dynasty"" in ""Dallas"" there are not that many strong women.  I found most of the main female characters simply too weak.  Sue Ellen tops the list with her constant victim mentality and ""I can't live without a man"" excuses.  She truly comes across as completely pathetic.  Her alcoholism just adds to her wretched

 persona.  At times you simply want to scream out, ""Get a life woman!""  Her coldness towards her son in the beginning of the season was almost too painful to watch and just shows how messed up this woman truly is.  Next is Pam who maybe a working girl but ultimately results to tears and tantrums when things don't go her way.  The storyline about the rare genetic disease that might kill her baby if she had one was okay but too drawn out.  I simply could not believe she simply could not tell Bobby about it from the start.  Miss Ellie comes across as more stronger then the previous two and she had one of the best storylines in this season.  Unlike Pam or Sue Ellen she at least isn't afraid to lock horns with her Ewing man.  Lucy at times seems nothing more then a sperm receptacle.  I mean really; couldn't they have written some interesting sub plot for her?  She simply jumps from one boyfriend to another and at the end remains single.  She even doesn't know how to pick men all that well either.  Her parents returning again was okay but it quickly grew boring.  What exactly is wrong with Gary Ewing anyway?  I think they should have made him gay in my opinion just like Stephen was in Dynasty.  Can you imagine JR having to deal with a gay brother?  He would have fed him to the sharks in no time.  I have to say I found Allan Beame JR's underling quite interesting and for some reason quite sexy.  I kept hoping that he had some dark secret to hide but it turned out to be just Betty Lu.  Then there is Kristin; the conniving sex kitten who teams up with JR and even tries to best him at times.  She was clearly one of the best female characters in the season.  Ray the foreman really didn't have much to say or do in this season say for an affair with Donna Culver which truly evoked the viewer to suspend disbelief.  I mean apart from a good roll in the hay what else could he offer such an accomplished woman?  Finally as for Pam's brother; I never liked his character.  He is just too creepy and weird and not at all attractive.  What did Sue Ellen ever see in him?  Overall, this was an exciting season with a grand finale at the end.  Highly recommended and please bring out season 4 soon!",1127952000,2,3350,4.306089743589744
2294421,5,B0009IW894,"I absolutely adore Dallas and am so pleased that they are being released onto DVD's. I was not born when most of the series was shown, but watched reruns when I was a teenager. Now that I am an adult, I am really into it. I just wish that they would release them more rapidly. One season per year is not nearly enough.",1126656000,,318,4.063492063492063
2294422,5,B0009IW894,"""Dallas,"" the complete third season, is the epitome of great television. I'm 21, so most of my tv-watching days were defined by situational comedies and shows with actual plots and scripts. Well, I was just taken-back by how great ""Dallas"" was as a show. This is definately a TV on DVD set that you need to own.

What's so great about ""Dallas"" is the plot. Yeah, the Ewings are involved in the oil industry, but there are a lot of other things going on. Sue Ellen deals with motherhood and her ""desperate housewife"" lifestyle. In season three, we watch her begin to emerge as JR's equal more than his subordinate wife. Marriage and relationships take center stage in season three as everyone faces some relationship issue; Jock and Miss Ellie have to get beyond their secrets; Bobby and Pam still have that newlywed hump to get over; JR has his affairs while Sue Ellen has her own set of problems and extra-marital interests. The list goes on from there.

I loved how every character had their own plot and time in the spotlight. Few shows these days manage to shine the spotlight on each and every character, even the supporting cast, and give the actors/actresses a chance to show off their talents. I was intrigued by Linda Gray's portrayal of Sue Ellen, while at times I could be moved by Barbara Bel Geddes' emotion-heavy Miss Ellie moments. You get the sense that this is a family; dysfunctional, but it's a real and accurate portrayal of a family that has to deal with a variety of subjects, including drinking, children, divorce and breat cancer. The only character that perhaps didn't get enough screen time was Lucy.

Season 3 is a must have, regardless. High quality writing, great plots, superb acting. Issues from seasons 1 and 2 are not forgotten as things are woven into the big picture. The finale of course was one of televsions greatest moments, a definate must see. As for other aspects of this release, I really didn't mind the packaging. I thought that a few more extras wouldn't have hurt but the one on ""Who Shot J.R.,"" where Hagman, Gray, Duffy, Tilton and others do an interview was fun and informative. Most of the episodes looked great in their DVD format; there were only a few that looked really dated and at a slightly lower quality. Otherwise, in a rare situation, I'd definately give this five stars. A must for your collection and viewing.",1126483200,,2372,4.683453237410072

2294424,4,B0009IW894,"The season is excellent - there's no question about that, particularly the Jock on Trial, Dove Hunt and of course the House Divided (Who shot JR?) episodes.
As with the previous box set, there aren't a lot of extras, but that's probably because the show is 20 years old and there's not much footage available. There are a few comentaries and a ""Who shot JR: A Dallas Phenomenon "" Documentary on the last disc.
The only major problem I had with this box set (which stoped me from giving it 5 stars) is the DVD Packaging.  The way they have packaged the DVD's caused damage to a couple of episodes (they've laid one DVD ontop of another, causing the bottom one to scratch).  I'd be watching a scene and then it would suddenly skip to the next scene, most of the time mid sentence! It was annoying at times.
Overall a good buy and a must for any true TV fan.",1126310400,2,855,4.304347826086956

This season is trully fantastic. Wonderful storylines n wonderful acting, especially by Larry Hagman and Linda Gray. JR and Sue Ellen for ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2294430,5,B0009IW894,"The fine folks at Warner Home Video released ""Dallas: The Complete Third Season"", a 5-Disc collection of DVDs, on August 9th, 2005. This set contains all 25 ""Dallas"" episodes from the 1979-1980 season (which marked the second full season for the series, following the 5-episode ""Mini-Series"" that aired in April of 1978).

Disc 5 of this very pleasant DVD boxed set contains THE biggest cliffhanger in television history, which is episode #25 of this third season (""A House Divided""). J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) crumples to the floor in his office building after being struck with multiple bullets that were fired by an unknown assailant. But....who pulled that trigger? Who shot J.R.? That was the big question during the summer of 1980 after J.R. got plugged. We'd have to wait until November 21, 1980, to find out the answer to that inquiry which took the nation by storm that summer and fall. The wait for the cliffhanger's resolution was even longer than normal, extending the suspense still more, when an actors' strike in Hollywood delayed the beginning of the 1980-'81 TV season.

A/V TALK --- Video and audio quality for this collection of Dallas episodes would rank in the ""above average"" range, IMHO. These shows look and sound darn good to me, in fact. Colors look quite natural, while the audio comes through clean and clear.

There's a bit of grain and fuzziness during some parts of some episodes (especially during the opening and closing credits), but overall I'm very happy with the way these shows look here. .... The screen ratio is the original TV ratio of 1.33:1 (Full Frame); while the audio has been encoded with care in Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono (English only).

These 25 episodes appear to me to be the full-length versions, except for the end-of-episode ""Coming Up Next Week"" trailer clips, which have been omitted here, just like they were on the 'Seasons 1 & 2' set. But the ""previews"" shown before each show are intact here. Running time per episode = approx. 48 to 49 minutes.

Chapter breaks are included for all episodes. There are 6 Chapter Stops per show, divided up just perfectly in all the appropriate locations. A break just after the Main Titles is included, so you can skip directly to Act One of each program.

THE PACKAGING --- I just love the image we find on the front cover of this set. It's a copy-and-paste job, sure -- but it looks great IMO -- with J.R. beaming with sinister glee (like he always does before pulling the rug out from under some poor, unsuspecting sucker in a fixed business deal). And then we've got a dandy pic of Sue Ellen, whose expression here conveys perfectly what her character was all about. Her smile here exhibits just the right blend of sleaziness and contempt, which were two of the oft-seen parts within the mixed bag of emotions that Linda Gray brought to the role of Sue Ellen throughout the long run of ""Dallas"". And she did it with such style and grace too. Gotta love that ""S'Ellen""! Fantastic cover design!

This ""Dallas Season 3"" set comes in a slimmer package than the first (Seasons 1 & 2) set. Same number of discs in each of those sets (5), but the S.3 package contains fewer flaps and panels within the nicely-done Digipak case. This due to the fact that four of the five discs are arranged in ""overlapping"" disc trays. A lot of collectors hate this overlapping design with a passion; but I think it looks pretty good actually, and reduces the amount of space required to completely unfold this type of packaging.

These hubs/trays are fairly nice -- not holding the discs too tightly. So the discs can be freed without too much risk of physical pain and/or disc-bending resulting.

When all Dallas #3 discs are removed, a nice picture of the Dallas skyline is revealed on the case underneath (similar to the previous 'Dallas 1 & 2' set).

Four of the five discs are double-sided, with episodes on both sides of Discs #1 through 4, while Disc 5 contains just the last episode of the season (""A House Divided"") plus a bonus ""Dallas"" documentary.

Normally, dual-sided discs are kind of hard to read, because there's no labels on them (only tiny writing on the inner ring of the discs to identify the side numbers). But with this DVD set, Warner Bros. has done a clever thing IMO (some people might disagree, but I think it's a much better way of labelling double-sided DVDs) -- they've placed writing on just Side A of each dual-sided disc, with the ""B"" side left totally void of printing/labelling.

In my opinion, this one-sided labelling is much nicer and user-friendly, because it's obvious which side is Side A or B by just glancing to see if there's any writing on the disc. There's no need to read the writing at all -- if you see any writing, it's Side A. No writing = Side B. Good idea. No eye strain to read the itty-bitty ""A"" and ""B"".

I'd much prefer single-sided DVDs for all releases. But if we have to have double-sided ones, the ONE-sided labelling procedure is a good method of identifying the side numbers, in my view.

Since Disc #5 of this set is only single-sided, it would have been nice (IMHO) to have included some disc artwork for that platter, but none is included (I guess in an effort to make all five discs look the same). And since that disc contains just one episode, which is the big hullabaloo-creating cliffhanger, it would have been a nifty touch by Warner Bros. if perhaps they had put on that disc a picture of J.R. lying wounded on the floor after receiving his ""just deserts"". But, oh well, ya can't have every little trivial thing I guess. :-)

EXTRAS --- As far as bonus DVD materials, there's a 20-minute ""Who Shot J.R.?"" documentary on Disc 5 of this third-season set, which was quite good (although I wish it was a bit lengthier; precise run time is 19:53). Copyright date for this bonus is 2005.

Cast members Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Charlene Tilton, Linda Gray, plus series creator David Jacobs give new filmed interviews and talk about the unbelievable ""Who Shot J.R.?"" phenomenon that swept America (and the world) in 1980. Various ""Dallas"" episode clips are seen throughout this piece.

The featurette opens with a clever ""Main Title"" sequence, which inserts present-day pictures of those participating in this program into actual ""Dallas"" opening-credits footage.

I would have enjoyed seeing some of the behind-the-camera stuff that was filmed (which I assume still exists in some Hollywood vault someplace) showing various outtakes and goings-on on the Dallas set during the making of the classic cliffhanger episode (""A House Divided""). I recall seeing that behind-the-scenes footage on some ""magazine""-type program in 1980 prior to the opening of the '80-'81 TV season. Unfortunately, though, none of that footage is included in this DVD documentary.

""Who Shot J.R.?"" Documentary DVD Specs ---- Video is 1.33:1 Full Frame. .... Audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo. .... No subtitles. .... No Chapter Breaks.

Plus, there are Audio Commentaries provided by stars Linda Gray and Patrick Duffy for two episodes (""Sue Ellen's Choice"" and ""A House Divided""). Some fun and interesting tidbits of info can be gleaned by listening to the two Commentary Tracks. I also like the way these audio tracks were recorded -- in 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo, with Linda's voice dominating one speaker, while Patrick's comments predominantly fill up the other front speaker. Nice stereo effect.

BOOKLET --- Unlike Dallas 1 & 2, the third-season package includes a multi-page (fold-out style) booklet with episode information for the twenty-five programs included in the set. This booklet includes some nice photos too, including a really outstanding publicity still of Sue Ellen and sister Kristin in front of the Southfork main house. The cover of the booklet has a picture of a wounded and crumpling J.R. Ewing after he's been filled with hot lead. Nicely done.

MENUS --- The ""Dallas Season 3"" Menu design is the same as the first Dallas DVD release. Upon initial disc load-up, the familiar and rousing opening theme music is played (and will repeat until a Menu selection is made).

All Menus feature ""static"" (non-animated) images, with the Main Menu offering up a good-looking group photo of the Ewing clan, which is the same picture that can be found on two of the fold-out panels of the inner packaging for this boxed set.

These Menus are ""anamorphic"" in nature. I can't quite understand, though, why Menus for a Full-Frame (1.33:1 ratio) TV show like this would be anamorphically-encoded when the programming contained on the discs is not in anamorphic widescreen? Many Full-Frame DVDs are like this however; certainly not just this one. Oh, well. Just another trivial matter that's of little consequence in the long run. It's just something that doesn't seem to be necessary, IMO.

""PLAY ALL""? --- Yes. A ""Play All Episodes"" option is located on all discs in this set. It's labelled simply ""Play"" on the Main Menu screen. It cannot be accessed via the ""Episodes"" Sub-Menu however.

SUBTITLES? --- Yes indeed. English, French, and Spanish subtitles can be accessed for all episodes.

---------------------

Closing Props.......

Dallas fans, as it says on the back cover of this DVD box -- ""This is the one"". .... That, indeed, it is. A very good collection of top-notch ""Dallas"" dramas, complete with large doses of backstabbing, boozing, and bickering. Plus, of course, that whale of a season finale, when J.R. finally ""gets his"" (in the shape of a couple of well-placed bullets). What more could anybody want?",1124755200,8,9549,4.841104294478527
2294431,5,B0009IW894,"Watching the third season of Dallas on DVD, I was struck at how good the writing was for this season.  When you watch the early episodes, with the introduction of Kristen and Alan Beam, you realize the writers were weaving together an engrossing tale.  So, by the time that shot is fired at J.R., everything comes together.

The season itself is extremely entertaining, from Pam and Bobby's troubled marriage, to Cliff's ill-fated run for office,  to Miss Ellie facing a personal struggle, and of course, the  marriage from hell between J.R. and Sue Ellen.  Forget Carlos and Gabrielle on Desperate Housewives, J.R. and Sue Ellen defined ""dysfunctional marriage"" 20 years ago.  Like a previous reviewer wrote, it's a shame that both Larry Hagman and particularly Linda Gray were not awarded Emmys for their performances; they're simply brilliant.  Nobody could play sexy, heartbreak, conniving and vulnerability like Linda Gray could.  She's completely watchable, from her affairs with Cliff and Dusty to her put downs on J.R., and her evolution from stone cold child bearer to loving mother is completely believeable and moving.  The rest of the cast is great as well, although I always thought Charlene Tilton, aside from a few episodes throughout the seasons, was the weak link in the cast.

If you loved Dallas, you will enjoy this collection.  Aside from the occasional outfit and hairstyle, the show is still as edgy and entertaining as it was years ago.",1124582400,7,1460,5.0375
2294432,5,B0009IW894,"First let me say it should ""not"" have taken a year to release the third season of this fantastic Primetime Soap!!! Hell, I finished watching the 1st and 2nd seasons in less than a week, so needless to say I was ready for the next season pronto!!!

Naturally, I had to have the third season dvd set in my hands the day it was released and popped the first disc in immediately! Ah, what a wonderful journey back to the rich indulgences of Dallas and all it's colorful characters. I especially enjoyed the antics of JR Ewing, starting with his toxic marriage to Sue Ellen,the tacky affair with Kristin( I cringed everytime she said ""Uncle Jock"",considering he was not!), the shady business deals, and the neverending desire to break up Pam and Bobby!

There were also some really touching stories between Jock and Miss Ellie. It's a shame Jim Davis' time on the show was cut too short. This was definately one of the best seasons of the series, which led up to the shooting of JR! It's amazing how the writers did such an excellent job weaving together all the storylines for the season cliffhanger. PRIMETIME TV WILL NEVER BE THIS GOOD AGAIN!!! I'm having major Dallas withdrawals already, so Warner Bros don't take too long to release Dallas Season 4!!!!!",1124496000,,1254,4.6441441441441444
2294433,5,B0009IW894,"Finally, Dallas Season 3 has arrived on DVD and it is a pleasure to own.  This is the season where everything started to fall in to place ... and you can definitely feel the shift in pace from the pilot and first season DVD.  Dont get me wrong, the first DVD is still a treat to watch, but it is patchy in parts, whereas this new season brings high quality episodes again and again.  Larry Hagman is simply brilliant as his role of JR continues to evolve just as the other characters do.  We also see the pain that plagues Bobby and Pam as they come to the realisation they will never have children.  And who can forget the late Barbara Bel Geddes as the ever loving Ms Elley?  Barbara brought 100% class to this show.

As another reviewer stated, this season wasn't really the season that the world anticipated ... it was actually the next season because people were desperate to learn the killer's identity. Still, this season has plenty of action in the build up to JR being shot - everyone hated him and you were left wondering who could have done it. This season was the very first soap to introduce a cliffhanger which captured the world. But interesting to note, the JR cliffhanger was not the originally intended cliffhanger for this season.  Extra episodes were produced because of the show's incredible popularity, so there was a last minute decision not to go with the original cliffhanger of Jock being put on trial for murder (about four episodes before JR got shot).

DVD FEATURES: The episodes have had some clean-up done, but alot of dirt and softness in still evident - but considering the age it has to be expected. There are two episodes with commentary from Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray.  The documentary ""Who Shot JR Phenomenon"" is a fantastic 20 minute presentation starring Patrick, Larry, Linda and Charlene reliving the magic and mayham of this cliffhanger, and how it affected their lives. Pure gold.

COMMENT ABOUT WARNER BROS:  It is unfortunate that Warner Bros are so slow to release Dallas seasons on DVD. It has taken them a year to release this latest season, and according to reports, this is what will happen with the next installment (August 2006). Technology is rapidly moving, and I think Warner Bros should reconsider. DVD technology will be replaced before we know it.  With 9 seasons all up, it would be great to release them all now (please!) thank you.",1124409600,16,2395,4.660332541567696
2294434,5,B0009IW894,"""Dallas's"" place in television history is cemented and Larry Hagman's ""J.R. Ewing"" ranks as one of the medium's most despicable yet captivating characters.  That said, the third season (actually the SECOND full one) has more to tout than Mary Martin's son and the cliffhanger-to-end-all-cliffhangers, ""A House Divided"".

This is the season that introduced Mary Crosby's wickedly alluring ""Kristen Sheppard"". The role had been originated by Coleen Camp in two earlier episodes but Bing's daughter made it her own, assuring her place in the annuls of television crime with an episode that would premiere in the following season.  Also on hand is Martha Scott as Sue Ellen's mother.  Scott had a lengthy Hollywood career and is best remembered for her motherly roles, having played Charlton Heston's mom twice in both The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur.

This is also the year that Gary Shackleford took over as ""Gary Ewing,"" the estranged son that would later be the star of the ""Dallas"" spinoff ""Knots Landing,"" also starring Joan Van Ark (""Valene Ewing"").

""Dallas"" also featured a variety of supporting players, culled from some longstanding character actors, that added to the success of the series.  Dennis Patrick (""Vaughn Leland""), George Petrie (""Harve Smithfield""), veteran Morgan Woodard (""Punk Anderson""), movie legend Keenan Wynn (""Digger Barnes"") and even Marlon Brando's sister Jocelyn (""Mrs. Reeves"") are colorful additions to the ""Dallas"" gallery.

In addition, season three introduced Jared Martin as ""Dusty Farlow,"" the true love of Sue Ellen's life, as well as the fictional son of future cast member Howard Keel.

""Dallas"" also continued its occasional jab at contemporary and provocative issues, especially with the two-parter ""Mastectomy,"" featuring bravura work from Barbara Bel Geddes, as ""Miss Ellie"" copes with the emotional and physical aftermath of the surgery, and Jim Davis's ""Jock Ewing"" having to make his wife feel that she is still the woman that he fell for forty years earlier.

But, more than anything, this is the season wherein Linda Gray (""Sue Ellen"") emerged as one of television's best actresses.  She ran the gamut of emotions as the much-maligned wife of the lecherous J.R., showing both supreme strength and extreme vulnerability.

It is a shame that neither she or Hagman ever received the coveted Emmy for their efforts.

The DVD compilitation features two episodes with interesting commentary by Duffy and Gray.

The only downside is the double-sided disc format.  This seems like episodes ""on the cheap"" and a show of this stature deserves better.",1124323200,27,2592,5.318627450980392
2294435,5,B0009IW894,"I've thought of this 1979-1980 as my favorite season for a long time (it's really the second season of the show, not the 3rd, as WB is packaging it.  We fans don't consider the 5 part trial run a season, which WB did count it as a season in the first DVD set).  I've been watching other seasons as they've appeared on Soapnet.  This just confirms to me this is the best season, IMO. There are so many great storylines... Miss Ellie's mastectomy (played magnificently by the late Barbara Bel Geddes), Jock's trial for murder, JR mortgaging Southfork, to name a few.  I even like the secondary characters that appeared this season, Alan Beam and Kristin.  Alan was such a snake as he first helped JR scheme against Cliff Barnes, then Alan tried to turn against JR. Then one of the best episodes of the entire show ends this DVD set...""A House Divided"", which ends with JR being shot.

I highly recommend this season of ""Dallas"" and hope WB doesn't make us fans wait almost another year for the next DVD set!!  I see so many other TV shows being released by WB much quicker.  They need to start releasing ""Dallas"" 4-6 months apart like they are with the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" and ""Gilmore Girls"", for 2 examples.",1123891200,5,1206,4.5

2294437,5,B0009IW894,"Nominated for 18 Emmys and 15 Golden Globes in its thirteen season run, Dallas is the epitome of the prime-time drama/soap opera genre. Premiering in 1978 as a five part mini-series, the show combines the usual sex and innuendo of classic afternoon soap operas with the freewheeling adventure of Texas wildcats and filthy rich capitalist oil barons. The combination of business dealings and rampant affairs tested well with both the male and female demographic, prompting CBS to make Dallas a regular part of its prime-time lineup. The result was one of the most successful television shows in history. In fact, the so-called 'Who shot J.R.?"" episode (""A House Divided"" Air Date: 3-21-1980) still reigns as the second most watched TV show in history (the season finale of MASH is #1). With one of most memorable characters ever created (the man everybody loves to hate), it's no surprise that Dallas held the #1 or #2 spot in the Nielsen ratings for most of the 1980s...

Dallas spent most of its television life in the Friday night time slot following the successful CBS series, The Dukes Of Hazzard. Creator David Jacobs originally intended to create a series around a poor Texas girl, Pam Barnes (Victoria Principal), who marries into a wealthy family (The Ewings) with whom her family has been feuding for decades. The first five episodes mostly center around the family discord faced by Pam and her husband Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) as they attempt to bring their families to a truce. But it soon became apparent to producers of the show that Bobby's scoundrel of a brother, Ewing Oil President J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), would be the true star of the show. Son of Ewing Oil founder Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and his wife Ellie (Barbara Bel Geddes), J.R. sought to make Ewing Oil the largest independent oil company in the world, and he intended to go to any lengths necessary to get what he wanted. And as you'll see, sooner or later, J.R. always gets what he wants... Along the way, he butts heads with life-long rival Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval), drives his own wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to alcoholism, and even mortgages the beloved Southfork Ranch (Miss Ellie's childhood home and the current residence of the majority of the Ewing clan). Southfork foreman Ray Krebs (Steve Kanaly) and Ewing grandchild Lucy (Charlene Tilton) add flavorful subplots to a series often dominated by J.R.'s nefarious schemes. In short, Dallas offers its viewers everything - money, sex, violence, conspiracy, intricate business dealings, etc. If you haven't seen it, then immediately start watching from the beginning episodes of Season 1. You won't be disappointed...!

The Dallas (Season 3) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""What Ever Happened to Baby John"" in which Sue Ellen returns to Southfork after recovering from the previous season's car wreck and delivering the Ewing's first grandson, John Ross. But Sue Ellen is not joyous. In fact, she sinks into a deep depression marked by bouts of alcoholism. Meanwhile, J.R. has taken on a talented lawyer, Alan Beam, as his understudy... John Ross remains in the hospital, recovering from his premature birth, until the family learns that he's been kidnapped. Everyone offers a theory on who did it, but it takes Pam's powers of observation to solve the mystery... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Ellie Saves the Day"" in which the family learns of J.R.'s devious plan to mortgage Southfork in order to drill for oil in Asia, and ""A House Divided"" in which J.R.'s crooked deal of selling the rights to Ewing Oil's Asian wells to his friends (because he knew they would soon be nationalized) comes back to haunt him when the season finale ends with his being shot in the most famous cliffhanger in television history...

2294438,5,B0009IW894,"The third season of ""Dallas,"" which aired in 1979-1980, opens with the questioned parentage of baby John Ross Ewing III, and with the addiction troubles of Sue Ellen, meanwhile, in full-swing. Jenna Wade returns, this time played by Francine Tacker. Pam gets pregnant again and miscarries, Miss Ellie has her mastectomy and, of course, Kristin worms her way into J.R.'s office and his life. (And we all know how that ends -- the shot heard 'round the world!) This season really sealed ""Dallas"" as a TV powerhouse. Thankfully, the show would only get better as the seasons progressed.
