It's one thing to read about the Holocaust in history books, but it is something entirely different to hear the stories from an actual survivor.",1363046400,,309,4.535714285714286
8565835,4,B00BC4GSN6,"Really interesting film. While presented in a basic Q&A format, his stories are very compelling. You can really see how affected he was by the unexplainable, horrific tragedy he lived through. Also, a bit of general history is presented at the beginning of the film, putting his experience into perspective.",1363046400,,307,5.16
8565836,5,B00BC4GSN6,"This documentary was both compelling and intriguing. Mike Vogel was able to thoroughly describe life inside the concentration camps and convey an image that stuck with the audience. This video also shed light on the numerous atrocities that took place within the camps as well as how they were maintained. His emotions were real, truly seen when speaking of his family's last days, and I thank him for telling this side of an absolutely terrifying story.",1362873600,,454,4.9868421052631575
