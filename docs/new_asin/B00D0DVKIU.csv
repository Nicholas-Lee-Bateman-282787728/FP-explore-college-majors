8588191,5,B00D0DVKIU,Good flick very naughty. I like chuck conners portrayal of the bomber. I like the main detective too. I love older movies this one did not dissapoint me,1486944000,,152,4.464285714285714
8588192,3,B00D0DVKIU,"Good enough as a 70's cop show. A bit racy with some good reasons to be rated R. Mostly it was good as a trip down memory lane and to see the old actors again. As a cop show, and I have seen many, its only average. The acting is good but the story line is a bit strange for my taste. Neville Brand and Chuck Connors don't disappoint.",1482192000,,333,3.8405797101449277
8588193,4,B00D0DVKIU,"Don't Buy this DVD from these rip-off sellers here at Amazon.com You can go right over to Diabolik DVD and purchase the same Code Red version for 20 bucks! The film itself is great, and very underrated. Still wish they made police dramas this gritty & filthy.",1435449600,,259,4.531914893617022
8588194,3,B00D0DVKIU,"Chuck Connors plays a really wierd, creepy, crazed terrorist bomber. Rapist Neville Brand is another weirdo who witnessed Connors blow up a hospital. Vince Edwards is a cop that believes in excessive force who knows that when he catches the rapist, he's got the bomber. This movie is from the early 70's and without all the tattoos, shaved heads, and body piercings that we have today, the police connection looks like it was filmed on another planet! With this uncut version, you mainly get to see the beauty of women's bare backsides and bouncing hooters, with welcome full frontals that had me wanting more and it really delivered on that. Connors as the bomber will make you cringe and gets a great comeuppance at the end. Just as Brand is finishing taking matters into his own hands in his private porno shack, he gets a special delivery from the bomber, a little thank you for turning him in. This is the full uncut version with a lot more nudity and a little more blood and action compared to the geneon release. 16X9 dvd has great picture and sound. Extras are trailers from other movies.",1382140800,5,1096,4.654639175257732
8588195,5,B00D0DVKIU,"What can I say about this CULT classic from the early 70's?  I first saw this movie at a movie theater in downtown Oakland with a group of friends back in 1973.  It was under the title THE POLICE CONNECTION.  We were all about 13 years old.  All of us were shocked and stunned that this masterpiece of sleaze only got an R-Rating.  It should have been X-Rated back then.  Today, it would be a ""Hard-R"".

This film was released on VHS and Television under the title THE MAD BOMBER.  Beware, these prints are all heavily edited and not worth your time.  But now, thanks to Code Red DVD, this uncut theatrical version is now available to the public for the first time in a remastered ""matted"" 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio.  I bought my copy from [...]

I'm not going to give a synopsis.  Just look up THE MAD BOMBER and you will get the story layout.  I have many other things to say about this film.

""THE COP"" is played by Vince Edwards (Ben Casey), doing his best to imitate 'Dirty Harry'.  His character's name is ""Geronimo"".  Yes, no kidding.  He's after a Mad Bomber who's out to kill as many people as he can.

""THE RAPIST"" is played by Neville Brand.  Imagine a greasy, pockmarked drooling Shemp and you have Neville Brand.  His character is obviously unemployed, and has a special ""work room"" at his house that is plastered with posters of his naked wife.  He spends his days watching porno films of his spouse while he ""pleasures"" himself.  Yep!  So, I guess you can call him an ""artist"" at photography and masturbation.  At night, he prowls his suburban neighborhood looking for hot young flesh to assault.  He's important to ""The Cop"", because during an assault on a deft mute, he saw ""The Mad Bomber"" and can identify him.  With me so far?  It only gets better!!

""THE MAD BOMBER"" is played by Chuck Connors in the role of his career.  (Yes, better than ""99 & 44/100% Dead"" or ""Tourist Trap"")  Connors wears a goofy looking suit and 2 inch thick bifocal glasses that makes his eyes look three times larger than they are.  Connors takes full advantage of this.  Every human being that he encounters during the entire film he verbally pummels.  Yes, he has some serious issues.  He even verbally assaults a police officer!!  Today, the cop would have ""tazered"" him, hog-tied his ass and thrown him in jail.  You must see these encounters to believe them.  All the other human beings that Connors encounters gets blown into next week with one of his bombs.  An example of this is when he encounters a ""women's-lib"" meeting.  He doesn't like what he hears.  I'm sure you can guess what happens.  So, anyone who encounters Connors in this film has two choices: #1: get verbally pummeled, or #2: DEATH.  That about sums it up.  At the end of the film, Connors decides that he'll blow up half of downtown Los Angeles, and upon completing his mission, ""everything will be okay again"".  Connors savors every moment that he is on screen!!

This low-budget piece of sickness has it all: Perversion, Voyeurism, Strippers, Blood, Excessive Gore, Rape, Murder, Nudity, Explosions, etc.  And now you can see it all in this unedited DVD from Code Red.  Don't let this movie slip by.  You better get a copy now while you have a chance before they are all gone!!!",1380931200,5,3246,4.553819444444445
8588196,5,B00D0DVKIU,"I first saw this movie on a late-late show in the 80s but nothing prepared me for the uncut version.  The violence in this film is closer to the Italian police thrillers that came out around this time, but the biggest draw is Chuck Conners' performance as the mad bomber that ranks with his loony in Tourist Trap.  If you have any recollection of this movie you'll love this DVD.",1376092800,3,379,4.4
8588197,5,B00D0DVKIU,This is the UNCUT VERSION RESTORED to its original intact Release a must have if you have been looking for the uncut version on DVD CODE RED is a GO GREEN.,1372204800,5,155,4.032258064516129
