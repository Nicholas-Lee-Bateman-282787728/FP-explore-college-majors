4489061,5,B004WQ2L7S,"Yes, everyone has heard and seen Humperdinck's H&auml;nsel und Gretel, and it has become a holiday staple in opera houses around the world.  But few, at least in the US, have heard of another work by Humperdinck - K&ouml;nigskinder - that receives a sterling performance here. The opera dates to 1910 and was hailed as the most important new opera since Parsifal. But in the century since, outside German-speaking countries K&ouml;nigskinder is rarely seen on stage.

The story is involved (the opera is 3 hours in length) and flows as follows: Once upon a time a witch cast a spell upon a king's daughter and held her in servitude as a goose-herd. A prince found her in the forest and loved her. She loved him in return, and would gladly have gone away from her sordid surroundings with him, though she had spurned the crown which he had offered her in exchange for her wreath of flowers; but when she escaped from her jailer she found that she could not break the charm which held her imprisoned in the forest. Then the prince left the crown lying at her feet and continued his wanderings. Scarcely had he gone when there came to the hut of the witch a broommaker and a woodchopper, guided by a wandering minstrel. They were ambassadors from the city of Hellabrunn, which had been so long without a king that its boorish burghers themselves felt the need of a ruler in spite of their boorishness. To the wise woman the ambassadors put the questions: Who shall be this ruler and by what sign shall they recognize him? The witch tells them that their sovereign shall be the first person who enters their gates after the bells have rung the noon hour on the morrow, which is the day of the Hella festival. Then the minstrel catches sight of the lovely goose-girl, and through the prophetic gift possessed by poets he recognizes in her a rightly born princess for his people. By the power of his art he is enabled to put aside the threatening spells of the witch and compel the hag to deliver the maiden into his care. He persuades her to break the enchantment that had held her bound hitherto and defy the wicked power.

Meanwhile, however, grievous misfortunes have befallen the prince, her lover. He has gone to Hellabrunn, and desiring to learn to serve in order that he might better know how to rule, he had taken service as a swineherd. The daughter of the innkeeper becomes enamored of the shapely body of the prince, whose proud spirit she cannot understand, and who has repulsed her advances. His thoughts go back to the goosegirl whose wreath, with its fresh fragrance, reminds him of his duty. He attempts to teach the burghers their own worth, but the wench whose love he had repulsed accuses him of theft, and he is about to be led off to prison when the bells peal forth the festal hour.

Joyfully the watchmen throw open the strong town gates and the multitude and gathered councilors fall back to receive their king. But through the doors enters the gooseherd, proudly wearing her crown and followed by her flock and the minstrel. The lovers fall into each other's arms, but only the poet and a little child recognize them as of royal blood. The boorish citizens, who had fancied that their king would appear in regal splendor, drive the youth and maiden out, burn the witch and cripple the minstrel by breaking one of his legs on the wheel. Seeking his home, the prince and his love lose their way in the forest during a snowstorm and die of a poisoned loaf made by the witch, for which the prince had bartered his broken crown, under the same tree which had sheltered them on their first meeting but the children of Hellabrunn, who had come out in search of them, guided by a bird, find their bodies buried under the snow and give them royal acclaim and burial. And the prescient minstrel hymns their virtues.

Ingo Metzmacher conducts the Zurich Opera House Orchestra and Zurich Opera House Chorus and the impeccable cast includes Liliana Nikiteanu (Soprano), Jonas Kaufmann (Tenor), Reinhard Mayr, Isabel Rey (Soprano), Marie-th&eacute;rese Albert, Wiebke Lehmkuhl (Alto), Oliver Widmer (Baritone), Kai Florian Bischoff, and Boguslaw Bidzinski (Tenor).  The most memorable in this fine cast is the extraordinary performance by Jonas Kaufman who continues to prove to the world that he possesses one of the finest tenor voices with a wide range and the physical prowess to create credible characters even when we know little about an opera.  Humperdinck's frequent bows to Wagner's music serves Kaufmann very well.  The entire opera is excellent here but the star is indeed Kaufmann.  Grady Harp, October 12

4489062,5,B004WQ2L7S,"compare to his other work Hanzel and Gretel, Konigskinder is relatively less known and less performed. In fact when I looked for a dvd, this was the only one. Intended as a family opera it is a fairy tale with witch, prince and princess. But adults can also enjoy for its dark insight on human nature and a nice terrible ending. Recently seen a live performance in Germany with my friend who thought Engelbert Humperdinck was a pop singer, the chance meeting with the opera and this dvd I bought at the venue gave me some useful reference points.

First this is for sure the best of what is out there which is an easy competition since there's only one.
Second, although modernised, this is a coherent, intelligent and beautiful production by reknowned Zurich Opera.
Third, I'd give a higher points on its theatrical level but the musical part was also brilliant.
Fourth, this is surely a much better production than what I saw on the stage for 60 something euro.

The work, although two protagonists suffer injust and die miserably without any rewarding consolation except some petty hallucination, is short and easy to swallow. Since it has star tenor Jonas Kaufmann as a main role, will be a good introduction to this work even for an opera newbie.(In this case my female friend)

My biggest complaint is there's no extra features in this dvd.",1350432000,20,1346,4.719148936170213
4489063,3,B004WQ2L7S,"The singing generally is on a very high level, but the work itself really
isn't of the first division. The composer's Hansel und Gretel is so
tuneful that you keep expecting something wonderful to break out, but
this lengthy and almost plotless piece just keeps chugging along. The
staging, furthermore, gives one very little to see, and the cast seems
to have shown up in their street clothes. But all praise to Decca for
making this available, and those interested in offbeat repertory will
no doubt be gratified. And Kaufmann really does make the visit
worthwhile.",1367020800,9,567,4.916666666666667

4489065,5,B004WQ2L7S,"An all-round splendid performance of an opera that should be far better known - this is a very welcome addition to anyone's DVD opera library.

Jonas Kaufmann, as expected, is stunning from all points of view; the other Knigskind, Isabel Rey, was perhaps too old at the time to be completely convincing (we have all become so demanding!), but she sings very well and her characterization is extremely touching. All the other parts are very well cast, including the minor roles, and the production is logical and attractive; excellent effects are delivered with simple scenic means, and our involvement in the final tragedy is total.  Splendid conducting from Ingo Metzmacher as well.",1364515200,3,683,5.089285714285714
4489066,3,B004WQ2L7S,"It is a delightful little fairy tale musically not too impressive.
Kaufmann, as usual, is the show.  I'm not sorry that I bought
it.",1364428800,,132,4.5
4489067,5,B004WQ2L7S,"I confess that I am totally unfamiliar with this work.  I have considerable difficulty following the story with its biolab setting, which otherwise should be in the forest.
This is one of the famous Zurich knapsack productions of the 21st century.  No trace of the Mrchenoper, but there are still reminiscents of the Anderson-like folklores, though.
In that sense, this production should not count as a failure, however unlike the original setting.
Certainly, in its most important sense - music wise, this is a first rate performance.  Ingo Metzmacher orchestrates the folklore materials in a grandiose manner, and the result is very luxurious to the ears.  On top of the rich sounding orchestra, of course we have the 21st century tenor king Jonas Kaufmann performing the title role of the King's son in one of his perfect renditions.  Kaufmann covers himself in total glory here, from singing to acting to stage presence, even though only dorned in everyday modern attire (this is a waste, in a way).  Not since the days of Pavarotti has one seen an operatic tenor singing and performing on stage with such total ease and utter abandon.  He is not singing or acting; he is just communicating via a media called opera - communicating to the audience, with his co-performers, with the conductor's orchestra, even communicating with the composer and librettist.
In a similar vein is Isabel Rey as the King's daughter, disguised as the goose girl.
I never realised what a great operatic performer Ms. Rey is - I have seen her in many other recordings: with Florez, with Harnoncourt, and others.  Here, she is so completely immersed in the character that you easily forget that she is acting.  The voice is not particularly thrilling, but it has a very warm colour and she modulates it so well that there is complete vocal acting every time she opens her mouth.  This soprano is on par with the excellent Kaufmann and makes a perfect match as the Konigskinder.
This performance would have similarly gained outstanding success if issued as a CD, for the rest of the cast is also wonderful.  The witch, the minstrel, even the chorus, there is not one single weaklink.",1361145600,11,2163,4.866485013623978
4489068,4,B004WQ2L7S,"A witch, a young King finding his Queen. Great ingredients for a fairy tale. But this one has a sad ending.  The plot is rather simplistic. It is the music that makes it work. It starts as a fairy tale, but develops into a real life situation, with bad people, the grownups, and good people, the kids that through their innocence recognize the fairy tale.  It is juxtaposition of the fairy tale world and the real one. Regrettably, this production forgot about the fairy tale side, and brings everything to a modern world. It looks awkward and certainly not effective. But... the music is great and makes the separation easy to identify. Kaufmann is the star of this production. His acting compensates for the misplaced production. Rey is also good, but not brilliant.  At some point I was tempted to turn off the image and keep the music only.
This opera was a great success when premiered in NY, later to be almost forgotten. Kudos to Zurich Opera for reviving this opera. I wish the staging would have been different. Since it is a seldom produced opera, I strongly recommend you get the Blue-Ray. I also recommend learning more about Ernst Rosmer (pseudonym of Elsa Bernstein-Porges). Her father relation to the composer and Wagner is quite intriguing.",1357344000,3,1256,4.778801843317972
4489069,4,B004WQ2L7S,"There was only one disc in the container; therefore Act III was missing.  This opera does not measure up to Humperdinck's masterpiece, Hansel und Gretel.  Kaufmann, however, is excellent as usual.",1356739200,2,196,5.290322580645161
4489070,3,B004WQ2L7S,"The quality of the recording is excellent, but it was incomplete.  I received only one DVD which means that the entire third act is missing.",1353715200,4,140,4.6
4489071,5,B004WQ2L7S,"I have the blu-ray of this performance and I love it.  One definitely needs to know something about the story before they watch it.
To remove any confusion that may arise. the work is in three acts. In this performance Acts I and II are done without an intermission between them.

The production is very workable and the singing and orchestral playing in it are very fine.  It is not a traditional production but you cannot have everything.

The work should be done more often.  If one checks Metropolitan Opera history it can be seen that Konigskinder was performed by that company 39 times between 1910 and 1914.  And Geraldine Farrar sang the Goose Girl in all 39 performances.

I highly recommend this performance to anyone interested in good opera and anyone interested in exploring new things.",1352592000,13,799,4.788321167883212
4489072,1,B004WQ2L7S,My copy of the DVD included only one DVD. The plastic package had room for only one DVD. But the DVD itself claims it is DVD1. It holds the first and second acts. DVD2 is nowhere to be found. Further the booklet describes the entire opera as being on one DVD. Someone goofed on this one. I assume this is true of all the packages shipped at least in this country.,1351987200,10,363,4.126760563380282
8445604,3,B004WQ2L7S,This production is fair but nothing like the Sarasota Opera's production from a couple of decades ago.  This opera and Kienzl's DER EVANGELIMANN are two late romantic operas that should be mounted far more often.,1519862400,,212,5.057142857142857

8445608,3,B004WQ2L7S,"A totally typical Eurotrash production which does no justice to the storybeing told. It may look like a fairy tale but it is NOT .
My DVD came with two discs AND the entire third act.  The story is is tragic and dark; why was it turned into a modern mishmash of styles?  My guess: it saves money on costumes and props. The three stars are for the singers and the orchestra.  The kind of opera I listen to without watching.  A pity it does not have an competition, and is only the second Humperdinck opera in the catalog.",1409702400,3,520,4.222222222222222
8445609,4,B004WQ2L7S,"I did get this opera after driving Amazon crazy because somebody wrote that one has to get the Blu-Ray version to get the complete opera and I don't have Blu-Ray facilities. But, as usual, Amazon came through for me and confirmed that he plain vanilla DVD contained the whole opera as well - which it does.
If it weren't for the atrocious first act, I could have easily given this recording 5 stars. It's not that the remaining acts are the greatest and offer us the fairy tale that this opera deserves, but the first act is totally beyond the Pale. As a matter of fact, if it hand't been for Kaufmann's outstanding singing and acting, I might never have finished watching the whole recording. I did and I'm glad.
The music, although not well know, is wonderful and so were most of the other voices. And as I am not a great lover of ""Haensel and Gretel"", I was more than pleasantly surprised.
I usually pick subtitles in the language in which the opera is sung - if given the choice. This way, I had a lot of fun with the atrocious, far fetched German. However, I have not forgotten how closely Humperdinck worked with and admired Richard Wagner. So it figures.
This opera is neither frequently sung nor recorded. I only have one other version of it on CD. Despite a few really valid negatives, altogether this opera is definitely worth having and, once you get over the first act, you will most certainly enjoy it as well.",1402444800,4,1423,4.476923076923077
8445610,2,B004WQ2L7S,"If I were rating this DVD on the performance, I would give it four or five stars.  Jonas Kauffmann is, as always, sensational, and the rest of the cast is very strong.  But I am giving it only two because the production is another exercise in directorial stupidity.  I'm not a big fan of modernized productions, but they work in some cases.  In this one, it doesn't.  This is a lovely and ultimately tragic fairy tale opera which is robbed of all its charm, coherence, and pathos by the ridiculous concept of a director who - like too many directors these days - thinks he knows far better than the composer and librettist how the opera should be done.  Instead of being set in the forest, the first act takes place in what seems to be a laboratory full of potted plants, where the witch, in a white lab coat, appears to be a mad scientist.  The Goose Girl's geese are just cardboard cutouts on sticks which are put into the plant pots.  The second act is set in a fast food restaurant where the employees wear silly cardboard crowns a la Burger King.  In the third act, for reasons which are not apparent, the director decided the Fiddler should be blind.  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  After listening to my old CD recording of this work, I was deeply moved at the end.  At the end of this DVD performance, I was outraged.  Unless you have to have every Jonas Kauffmann performance or have a very high tolerance for directorial nonsense, skip this one.  Or just listen to the singing with your eyes closed.",1387929600,10,1523,4.3736654804270465
8445611,4,B004WQ2L7S,"I really hated the staging of this opera; it's a fairy tale forced into a contemporary setting. I had expected something different and had a hard time relating to the opera although the music was beautiful and the singers were everything you could wish for, and more. I think that once you get used to the unattractive, dull staging and know what to expect, you can enjoy the opera nevertheless.",1382659200,4,395,4.6571428571428575
