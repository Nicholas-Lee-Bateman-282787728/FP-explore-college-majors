8085916,3,B000BF2KI4,"It was the year of 1994 when Sid was exposed to his first venture into the world of the Truth or Dare Saga. We strolled into a local video store looking for a nice horror flick when we came across something that looked so B it just had to be done. Once we reached to counter the guy took one look at the film and said ""I don't know what this is and how it got in here"" but luckily he rented it out to us. The next couple hours went down in history opening our eyes to possibly the worst film ever known to man. It made The Final Sacrifice look like a Martin Scorsese oscar winning masterpiece, which naturally leads us to this weeks review. We found out that the very unknown writer/producer Tim Ritter slapped together his third installment of this disastrous saga and we just had to torture ourselves one more time.

Screaming for Sanity leaves off where the last mess ended with the copper masked madman sitting at a table with Tim Ritter accompanied by his 3 ft mullet and Dr. Dan Hess(Joel D. Wynkoop) talking about playing a game of truth or dare. It's sounds all a bit homo-erotic to us but it doesn't matter anyway. So now the coppermasked killer is on the loose again and Dr. Dan Hess has to bring him to justice. The film literally just jumps from scene to scene with no explanations of whats going on. All you get to see is the copper headed monster taking out a few dead beats in Florida and the robust Dr. Dan chasing him around like Sid chases women with a pink turkey baster. Now despite the zero plot situation there were some really hilarious scenes that allowed us to keep the movie running instead of cutting it off early for a couple boards of Sonic. Two memorable moments were: 1) When the killer breaks into someones house (who has a Rumplestilksen poster) and kills him with a bottle of drano, 2) The ending fight scene with Dr. Hess and Copper head which made the worst dubbed martial arts movies look like works of art. That actually wraps up the film. In typical fashion the ending credits seem to pop up out of nowhere and leave you looking at you buddy asking ""What was this movie about?""

All in all this one was just terrible. Even for a movie shot entirely with a personal camcorder from 1987 it was so bad. It recieved 3 stars more on sentimental value then anything else. In a normal persons review Screaming for Sanity wouldn't have even recieved half a star. Actually a normal person wouldn't even go near this trash. But if you do decide to give it a shot be prepared because you could find much much better acting & quality in a porno.",1218153600,4,2572,4.345114345114345
