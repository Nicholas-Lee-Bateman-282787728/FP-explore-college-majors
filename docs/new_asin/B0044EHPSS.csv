This product has four movies starting with the 1959 movie Psycho from Alfred Hitchcock. It was a big hit but seems tame by later standards. The carefully edited scenes suggested more than what you saw. One scary part was the sound of a knife blade piercing flesh. But a butcher knife is designed for cutting or slashing, it lacks a hilt to prevent the wielders hand from sliding down the sharp blade and getting cut. Why would a horror film be so successful? Some say a recession or depression creates a market for horror films (as with the current Great Recession). These films feature Anthony Perkins who plays a crazy maniac very well. The first movie mentioned the new highway bypassed the motel and caused a loss of customers. Does poverty cause an increase of violence, crime, and mental illness? Are there benefits from these changes? See the individual reviews for more details.

Psycho from 1959 was from a short story based on a true crime. Marion Crane takes a large sum of money and goes on a long drive then stops at a motel for the night. [Note how she has white underwear before the theft but black underwear afterwards!] Is the motel manager a nice young man who obeys his mother? A private investigator tries to locate the missing money and visits the Bates Motel. Sister Lila and boyfriend Sam try to find Marion. The good guys win in the end. A psychiatrist explains this story. Are there other missing persons?

Psycho II from 1983 shows Norman Bates released from a state hospital because his psychiatrist says he is cured. [No mention of politics cutting the budget so inmates are released earlier, or the use of drugs to control his condition.] Will Norman still obey his mother?

Psycho III from 1986 shows Norman Bates again returning home after many years. Not much has changed, for better or worse. They show parts of older movies as a reminder. You know what is going to happen, but there will be one or two surprises. Note how people who do wrong wind up getting killed, like in some classic mystery novels.

Psycho IV from 1990 shows the historical background to Norman Bates madness. This is by far the worst of the series, as if they ran out of ideas or were on a lower budget. No mention of the local voters or any control over a dangerous house.",1501200000,,2320,4.553956834532374
