8017115,5,B0001WTW9M,"This was a gift and the person who got it said the following: ""I love the DVD and I'm happy you bought it! The image resolution was less than stellar but that's to be expected of a DVD that's this old. (I've been forever spoiled by Blue Ray). Overall a great walk down memory lane"".",1468108800,,282,4.1454545454545455

8017120,5,B0001WTW9M,"Hombres G's 2002-2003 ""Peligorsamente Juntos"" tour took the band to a higher level, where their dedication and hard work were all about the fans. For this hugely popular Spanish band, this tour was a response to a massive audience that had prayed and waited for their reunion. This album embodies complete fulfillment of expectations in matters of music and performance. It also holds great symbolic value because it's the essence of a dream come true to their followers.",1085356800,7,471,5.051282051282051
8017121,4,B0001WTW9M,"Hombres G is a Spanish band with a simplistic catchy style. Their lyrics often edge in the comic side, such as a guy throwing ""itchy dust"" to another guy for taking his girlfriend or crocodile girls biting guys at nightclubs. The music is fresh and far from presumptuos and, for the third time, catchy. This DVD is the live recording of a reunion of the band that will leave all those who are familiar with them very satisfied.",1081987200,10,427,4.487179487179487
