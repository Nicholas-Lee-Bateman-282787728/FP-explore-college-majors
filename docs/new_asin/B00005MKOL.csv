1625747,5,B00005MKOL,"I did not experience the packaging nightmare described by earlier posters, rather it seems that the manufacturer has switched to two boxes with 8 discs in each.  They are easy to access and seem secure.  I'm enjoying these episodes from the 1960's series.  I'm not bothered by the relatively primitive video reproduction, since that's what the series was like originally.  The sound, fortunately, seems to have been enhanced, or at any rate, is at an acceptable volume and easy to hear, not always the case with these early TV shows.  This is a great price for these great episodes from a classic series of the TV era.",1518220800,,618,4.738317757009346

1625753,5,B00005MKOL,"""THE AVENGERS"" Is a uniquely stylized 1960's detective series with a charming British flavor.  The cool personas of the two sophisticated stars, Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee, are reminiscent of Myrna Loy and William Powell of ""The Thin Man"" movies and their endearing tongue-in-cheek view of life. The key elements that most clearly define and distinguish the ""Avengers"" series and make it distinctly different from others in this genre, are 1) the show's electrifying and engaging original music that is an integral part of its sublime magic; 2) the often thought-provoking bizarre stories and characters; and 3) the offbeat camera angles and artistic imagery. In addition, the show's overall cinematic artistry generates an eerie yet charming aura of exciting mystery.  The episodes are fun and seldom fail to engulf the senses and activate the imagination.  A viewer is ultimately attracted to the cool and unflappable personalities of these two stylish, cultured, and intelligent crime fighters.  No matter how hopeless or mystifying their situation, Steed and Mrs. Peel always manage to find a logical solution to the problem.  (They remind me of another pair of English sleuths named Holmes and Watson).I'm sure you'll find ""The Avengers"" to be a most enjoyable series, and will award it its own special place in your collection of vintage classics.",1517788800,,1356,5.288372093023256

1625824,5,B00005MKOL,"Steed and Mrs. Peel, a post-war Nick and Nora; were the 1960s British detective duo extraordinaire. They had a relationship dynamic that was full of wit, innuendo, respect and a lot of quirky British silliness.  Steed, always the gentleman with impeccable manners even in the face of goofy dangers; and Emma - sexy, intelligent, confident and very low-key greeted viewers in each episode opener with the clinking of champagne glasses. After watching a few episodes for the first time in decades, I was struck by the excellent editing and creative stage props for that time period. The story lines are mostly fantasy but great fun. The boxed set includes the years Mrs. Peel worked beside John Steed. Very enjoyable. The DVD packaging they are housed in is a mess, with many of the discs loose and impossible to keep in place. When you open the box, the discs come tumbling forth. Oh well, a small inconvenience for what awaits.",1510790400,,927,4.830188679245283

1625833,5,B00005MKOL,"Classic 60s. Some reviews had complained about the grainy appearance. It was like that when it aired on public TV, so that is part of the charm. It is like owning an LP record or an 8 track player. If you want the sight and sound of the old days then you must experience it. People are spoiled by high def.

1625860,5,B00005MKOL,"I remember seeing a few of these episodes on television while growing up. I have already worked my way through the first DVD in the set and I am excited to see all the episodes in this set.

PLEASE NOTE that the packaging seems to have been greatly improved from the sets that some of the other buyers received.
In the set I received, there are two plastic DVD cases in a larger cardboard slipcase. Each of the two plastic cases holds eight DVDs - none of which overlap. Much more convenient than the older packaging.

Hope this helps.",1505952000,,535,4.393939393939394

1625905,5,B00005MKOL,"Any book/DVD/ or anything else that has the title of ""The Complete Emmy Peel Megaset has to be good. If you are too young to remember Diana Rigg as Emma and Patrick Macnee as John Steed, this series will be a treat. The two work for the British Government and deal with all types of evildoers in an suspense but also very witty series. ""The Avengers"" was one of the best series in the history of television.",1501200000,,407,4.298701298701299
1625926,5,B00005MKOL,"Yes, one episode from this megaset featuring all the content starring Diana Rigg opposite the unflappable Patrick MacNee was enough to confirm this is one of the classic, and timeless television series from the 1960s, and to state the obvious, something US television could not replicate.",1501027200,,288,5.282608695652174

Fabulous costumes for Diana Rigg, and way ahead of its time. Picture and sound very well remastered to fit full widescreen and Dolby equipped smart TV's. The black-and-white episodes are crisp and sharp, and the color is fine. No subtitles though, so if you're hearing-impaired you're going to need your hearing aides in good working order.

1625929,5,B00005MKOL,"I used to own the 1967 series on video back in the day. I have loved this show ever since it made its way to American television back in 1967. Now, in this collection, I have all the Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) episodes, the black & white and the colored episodes I will say, I seem to love the black & white episodes better. They were better written and acted. The colored episodes were good, but a bit cheesy by today's standards. The Avengers were spies that worked for the British government, and were always assigned the big murder capers. The show dabbled in mystery, science fiction, murder, and time travel. One never knew what the next episode would bring to these wonderful characters. The 'Mrs. Peel We're Needed' stunt got a big cumbersome at times. O, well. One of my favorite episodes in the series is the last one Rigg did - The Tie-Me-Knot. In this episode we say goodbye to Mrs. Peel, and hello to Tara King. The show undergoes some new changes to accommodate the new partner. Watching Mrs. Peel say goodbye to John Steed was a bit touching, and I would say - very real. The chemistry between those two characters was real and really made the show a much more watchable event. This is one of my all-time favorite television shows, and I still enjoy watching it so many years later.",1500422400,,1293,4.483050847457627

The final episode introduces Mother, and Tara King who replaces Emma Peel (Series 6, 1968-1969), but that is the end of the collection.  I didn't realize that there were Series 1 to 3 (1961-1964) aired also, with John Steed for most and Dr. Cathy Gale for part of Series 2 and all of 3.

The unique mix of adventure, mystery, violence, fantasy, tacit sexual tension, and science fiction, along with the incorporation of a female co-lead whose significance was 50:50 with her male counterpart, was surely notable for a TV show in its day.

After viewing the entire set, only the two criticisms are of note: 1) the hand-to-hand fight scenes are at times downright silly (even by 1960s US broadcast TV standards)  at its worst resembling spirited gymnastics routines; 2) the 1966-67 season (the color episodes) definitely lack story originality, and depth  i.e., that inanimate essence that so captivated the viewers in the 1965-66 season (the b/w episodes) is subdued; in addition, viewers will also note Mrs. Peels attire takes a more traditional turn.

Otherwise, the set is surely recommended.",1479945600,,834,5.384615384615385

1626104,4,B00005MKOL,"While I have not made my way through the whole set, I have been pleased with what I have seen so far. I watched this series back when it was originally broadcast on ABC here in the States. I am about half way through the '65 programs and the only thing I miss is the tacked on opening that was done for the US market. My only ""minor"" complaint would be that A&E did not do a full restoration of these episodes. Improving the video glitches would be nice, but would have certainly added to the cost significantly.

The episodes are representative of the time. Not too serious in tone - think tongue in cheek - and the fight scenes are unrealistic. Imagine being able to knock someone out just by throwing them into a wall or flipping them over somersault like. Gunshot wounds rarely evidence any blood escaping from the victim's wound. It could be I'm too influenced by the way fight scenes are done today - some of which are way over the top in the other direction - and that colors my reaction.

The delight, for me, is the interaction between Macnee and Rigg. They work very well together. The cool thing is that, while Steed is the ""top professional"" and Peel is the ""talented amateur"", Rigg's character is presented as a highly intelligent, cutting edge individual - a role usually left to the man in this era. Refreshing to say the least. It's also fun to be reminded of what fashion at this time was like. While Macnee is presented as a stylish gentleman from an earlier era, Peel is attired in a quite trendy style. Another interesting facet on this subject, during this time period women were presented with ""pointy"" bosoms - not the rounded, more natural look of today. Another sign of the time in which this series was produced.

Would you - or should you - like/buy this series? If you're set for a not too serious set of storytelling along with a nostalgic look back into the mid 60's the set would be worth at least renting as a good representation of possibly the first spy-fi series. Serious fans will want to own the set. I have no regrets buying it for myself.",1470528000,,2077,4.446194225721785

I only saw bits of the series in the US when I was a kid.  Too young to appreciate the whole magic of the Avengers.  I was enthralled by Steed's umbrella cane with the hidden sword and Emma Peel's kick-ass fighting.  Shows how easily impressionable little boys are. ;-) Only after getting a tinge of nostalgia on YouTube (always liked the theme music) and the vintage style of the series did I pick this up.

1626258,5,B00005MKOL,"Marvelous tongue-in-cheek spy/mystery/suspense series that never fails to entertain. In this, the 'Complete Emma Peel Megaset', each episode is laced with the amusing interplay between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. I enjoy the fact that Steed is always impeccably dressed, complete with bowler hat and umbrella, while breaking into places or fighting with the bad guys.  Mrs. Peel is intelligent, independent, deadly, and always alluring. Together, they wage a never-ending battle against saboteurs, madmen, assassins, spies and just plain whack jobs, each of whom is out to do damage to some facet or other of British life.
 My opinion is that this series was the inspiration for the US TV series 'Wild, Wild West'.  In an era that gave us far too many James Bond knock-offs on film and  TV, this show dared to be different.  All in all, great fun.",1450051200,,850,5.0

The 2nd disk is the more recent, in color, and Emma gets to romp a bit more. It looks like all the shows I remember seeing on TV (about 1967) are there. It even has one episode I missed on TV that shows their boss and where he works. Of course, this is not something for the serious mystery fan, used to Ellery Queen or Agatha Christie... this is just a romp and spoof of the popular 60's spy/cloak & dagger. I sometimes wonder how many times they had to shoot a scene when Emma (Diana Rigg who is a serious Shakespearian actress) could not keep a straight face... especially hokey (on purpose) was the Z.Z. von Schnerk Production where the bad guys prepare to saw Emma in half with a 6' blade at a sawmill....

Each disc has three episodes, with the exception of the final Disc (16), with four episodes.

1626493,5,B00005MKOL,"This is a classic TV show from my childhood that made a big impression largely because of its stylized characters and quirky scripts. When I put the first disc in, the opening theme music immediately transported me back to my 1960's living room. This box set gave me a chance to start from the beginning and watch the evolution of the show. This show, I understand now, was really a love story between John Steed and Emma Peel and I think that's why it worked so well. If women were looking for strong feminine models back then, Emma Peel fit the bill. Her cool, urbane intelligence is uniquely western as she karate chops and high kicks her way through the weird assortment of villains. The dry wit of both characters is classically British and it sort of relates to the type of humor seen from the Beatles at the time. This was why British culture had us all so captivated back then; it was ""mod"", intelligent and never took itself too seriously. But you also knew that as long as Emma and Steed were around there was a bigger, more interesting world out there beyond your commonplace New Jersey backyard. The only technical complaint I have with this DVD box set is that the sound level between the introduction music and the shows themselves is a bit uneven, requiring the viewer to turn the volume up when the show begins.",1427587200,,1327,4.533333333333333

I now find it lacking in any real sense of our intrepid duo being in real danger by today's standards. While there is a lot of subtle wit from both Mr. Steed and Emma Peel, it seems to be badly dated and of another era. The dangers they face are mostly set-ups and you know they will outwit the villian.

You might not guess it if you watch her in Game of Thrones or the Doctor Who episode she was in, but she defined it back then. In retrospect, it was more her attitude than anything else.

Steed was so cool and Emma was soooo hot. A sexy lady in leather body suit [ every teenager boys dream] and she could kick some serious assets. The series was off the wall, we had never seen anything like it. It's still a lot of fun to watch with all the quirky plots and characters and Emma still looks hot in her leather outfit.

Also, it would cost me much more to buy all the Linda volumes than just this one, and both girls with the consistent Mr Steed make for good shows. This is definitely worth the price, but as I find a good many clever things about it, and some funny, nothing still beats the Linda Thorson episode with John Cleese guest-starring. Just the funniest Avengers episode I have ever seen! The episode I speak of can be seen here:

1626802,4,B00005MKOL,"I have to admit that I ordered this set with some trepidation after reading the reviews about the poor packaging, but I went ahead and ordered it based on the most current reviews. I have no complaints about mine when it showed up 4 days later. The two disk holder boxes have what I would describe as a staggered layer format for holding the disks that works very well. The disks are held securely in two disk boxes in order and are numbered and are easy to get in and out of the holders. Viewing the disks brings back memories of stuffing clothing under the door so that my parents wouldn't hear me watching at night back in the 1960s, the show was on at nearly 1:00am. I had forgotten about glorious black and white TV, the disks show quality is at least as good as the original broadcast TV but in some places in the episodes it gets rather dark, ""Castle De'ath"" notably so in the scenes in the castle hallways. Still its Steed and Emma as they were meant to be and now years later I catch a lot of sexy innuendo that I missed in my youth going on between John and Emma. All and all a good purchase worth the money and at a much lower price than other ""complete collections"" of the show running over two hundred bucks.  Very little in the way of extras except some stills of the production about 6 per disk dealing with the shows on the disk and nothing else.  A digital remaster would be much appreciated for this old series much of which was taped (indeed some of the very first episodes were filmed) and then transferred to disk without clean up, but that might have raised the cost substantially so I will deal.

If you're interested in funny episodes, ""The Correct Way to Kill"" and ""Murdersville"" absolutely shine. If you want much stranger and thought-provoking, perhaps try ""The House that Jack Built"" or ""The Joker.""

You'll find that Steed is the quintessential gentleman, complete with a steel bowler and an umbrella with a few secrets. Mrs. Peel is witty and doesn't take nonsense from anyone; she is perfectly capable of beating up the bad guys.

This gentle and clever spoof doesn't have blood, guts, swearing, or sex. The action is cheesy and characters cheesier. It is well worth every penny of the price.",1406332800,,904,4.895424836601308

Many of the stories, indeed, have a timeless quality to them, so the series as a whole is only dated enough to add to its charm. The humor, the quirkiness, the brilliance of the plots have all survived well into the next century. My quibble is with the atrocious packaging. The DVD disks arrive in a clumsy, fragile package, and spill all over the place once you get it opened. Yes, it's worth the inconvenience to own the entire series, but keep several DVD ""jewel boxes"" on hand to repackage the disks.",1404950400,,641,4.487179487179487

Good news.  It turns out there is indeed a package with all episodes in them.  And I have just finished watching the last of them.  I highly recommend paying the extra amount and getting the full series.  There is a lot to be seen in all the episodes, and dare I say that I liked the other Steed Girls just as much as Emma.  I feel sad for anyone who limits themselves to only the Emma Episodes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
My only problem with this set is that it is what it is, only the Emma episodes.  I get that many people are happy with just these episodes since they are the most popular; so it is great that this option exists.  But the entire TV series has just shy of 170 episodes.  I would have been very happy to buy the full 170 episodes even if they are not ""restored"", and without any ""bonus"" disc, for 150$ (same basic 1$/episode price).

1626888,3,B00005MKOL,"Let me qualify my review with this point. I was about 10 to 13 years old when I watched the Avengers on television. I thought Patrick MacNee was the James Bond of weekly television and Emma Peel was the best female on television. She was pretty, incredibly smart in all areas and she could fight. That was then and now almost 50 years later the show really cannot stand the test of time. My first complaint is that the fight scenes are horrible by today's standard.

Now that I got that out way, the storylines are pretty good and most do stand the test of time. Surprisingly, my wife who was not born when the series was on television actually enjoyed these dvds. She sees similarities between The Avengers series and the Thin Man movies we have in how they work together to solve crimes. So at this price, with 51 episodes I am quite sure that you will find enough episodes to get your moneys worth.",1404518400,,901,4.395209580838324
1626889,5,B00005MKOL,"The Avengers franchise existed before Emma Peel arrived and stayed around after her departure, but I think Peel and John Steed were, by far, the best team of the series. Suave, wry and smart, Steed could be ruthless when necessary. Peel was Steed's equal, rather than just being a pretty face. The series is set against swinging London of the mid-1960s and has our two heroes battling everyone from Soviet invaders to mad scientists, all tongue in cheek, of course. Lots of fun! The transfers are pretty good, considering the vintage of the episodes. A real bargain compared with the price of this set from a few years ago.",1404518400,,623,4.724770642201835

I am not reviewing or giving stars for the series itself.  Would-be purchasers are probably familiar with the series anyway.

The disks seem to be in pristine condition. The packaging is excellent, cramming 16 DVD's into space conserving two-box set that looks like it would do a good job of protecting them during normal handling.

Other reviewers have berated the quality of the packaging and the condition of the disks upon arrival, but mine look very good so far.  I have played or tested about one-half of the disks so far, and found no problems.

Edited a few days later - I am awarding the fifth star after all.  After viewing about ten episodes on my HDTV and Blu-Ray player, I found the video quality good-to-excellent, especially considering the age of the master tapes.  And I have now tested all sixteen disks with no problems.

Other comments - half of the episodes, from 1967, are in color.  The color quality is very good.  The video quality of the color episodes is slightly better than the quality of the black and white episodes from 1966-67.",1403308800,,1270,4.675675675675675

This packaging though has two flaws:
1. The discs are merely numbered and you have to look at the back of the box to reference an episode.
2. The discs are packed so tightly that you have to walk on eggs to get at the one you want, and then carefully lay aside the ones not in use.

I have the EP megaset issued by A&E some time ago, These are exactly the same only the Splash Page reads ""Lionsgate""

I was hoping someone would issue these programs un cut and unedited with scenes never seen before, From my research I know they exist. Also, why not a digitally enhanced version and even (although it may cause a tempestuous debate) the 4th season ""colourised"". (poor attempt at British spelling.)",1400284800,,782,4.386206896551724

1626953,5,B00005MKOL,"I just recently learned of the availability of this set and I had to have it. But i was spooked by some user comments about inferior packaging resulting in damaged discs. As a result I requested that the set be shipped securely packed in a box rather than the typical bubble-pack envelopes that are common for DVD shipments. I needn't have worried. My set arrived earlier today in perfect shape.  It consists of two DVD cases each containing eight discs  with four swing-away double-sided trays in each case. Both cases come in a snug sleeve that duplicates the info on the cases. Bottom line, excellent packaging, NO problems. i have no clue what the complainants received but it obviously wasn't this set. My only advice is to open the case carefully as the two halves are a very snug fit. This is good but requires care.

HERE'S WHAT I THINK IS A HELPFUL HINT:  The first thing I do when I receive a new DVD or a DVD set is to play every disc at a reasonable fast forward speed and watch the screen for any hang-ups or glitches. I have a fairly large DVD collection and there are still many I've not yet gotten around to viewing.  I've found  that checking them this way in advance of viewing normally is a must. If a DVD has a defect it always seems to show up in a reasonable  fast forward  speed. Fortunately It's fairly rare that I receive a defective disc but it does happen occasionally. This saves the unpleasant surprise of finding out after the return period has passed that there may have been a bad one in the bunch.

Beautiful, super intelligent, able to hold her own with any man (including John Steed) and above all the ability to keep a cool head no matter what was happening.( and in my case tall, but of course that never came about) there was a sexual tension between Mrs. Peel and John Steed that fairly pulsated thru the television screen at times, but of course this lady is cool and the tension remained unfulfilled. The pleasure has been all mine to sit down and re-watch this wonderful cult series from Great Britain (the first to be shown in America). Many feel the classically trained stage actress Diana Rigg was wasted on this series, but I am so glad she did it. She gave us a new ideal for women to strive for in a changing new world.",1397260800,,938,4.305084745762712

I would wear my dance leotards and tights or ""stretch pants"" (what we called stirrup pants then) to try to look like Mrs. Peel.  This brings back so many memories, and it's still fun to watch.

It took a few episodes to get into the swing of things but by disc 2 I was really enjoying this comical, entertaining, dry, witty British romp of two Brits saving the day in all kinds of crazy 1960s ways. One of the many fascinating things this show has to offer is time capsule insight into what was popular in the 60s in British culture as well as contemporary thought in science, psychology, extrasensory interests such as ESP and hypnotism, and more. The Avengers has fun story lines supported by Patrick MaCnees wonderful depiction of an eccentric and seemingly aloof character that is very talented and quick witted in any situation, and the adorable Diana Rigg as Steeds super intelligent, karate chopping original fem fatale side kick. If there is a downside it is the appearance in that is was made in the 60s but story and fun definitely carry the line: enjoy!!",1397001600,,1140,4.45933014354067

The set released by Lion's Gate is the exact one done by A&E they are not hiding the fact since the menu on the discs say A&E right there.
The quality is good but there are some blemishes on early black and white episodes. These are still more than viewable and the charm of the show is intact. This show was and is one of a kind and the writing is the reason. The show was never very serious when Diana Rigg came on board which helped it be the highly watched show it was. You quite literally have to see some episodes to know what I mean.

However, I also always thought she was the most entertaining of the Avenger ladies as well as the prettiest, although her martial arts seem to be on-again off-again. (I also preferred her as a Bond Babe over Honor Blackman). And of course Patrick MacNee was the ultimate suave understated British gentleman spy.

I loved the series back when it was on TV and I think this Emma collection is a good value.

Ive watched about half so far and the transfer seems good quality, given the age of the series. And it plays on the PC. Sadly not much in the way of special features.

Several people panned the packaging in reviews so I had my fingers crossed, but it seems to be adequate. It came in two sub-sets of eight discs each, and all the discs were in their appointed slots with no scratches in evidence.",1396742400,,916,4.434523809523809

This is the probably most responsible project that either has ever undertaken and fortunately they are only responsible for the demise of disks.  This is why I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 because the content at this price is a steal.

At $25, I felt I could not pass up the opportunity to complete my set of the Emma Peel episodes, I already had about half of them.  I figured if it came damaged, I could send it back for another set and it would still be worth it.

I was lucky, when my package arrived, I could hear the disks rolling around inside, but none were damaged.  I took them all out and put them in individual cases that I bought in Staples.

1627112,3,B00005MKOL,"I see from some of the reviews that the packaging for this Emma Peel megaset seems to have been revised.  If that's the case, great.  But I just got this set for Christmas, and it's March now, so be advised that there may still be some of the older packaging hanging around.  The old version is as bad as everyone says it is.  In some cases you have to remove three disks to get to the fourth one beneath them.  That's just goofy product design right there.

There are a couple of other things to watch out for.  Are you hard of hearing?  Then take a long pause before ordering.  There are NO closed captions -- not embedded in the DVDs, nor in the vertical interval (which some shows carry as they are broadcast).  Imagine my surprise when I bought a new HDTV and found that I could barely understand anything Steed and Mrs. Peel said.  (As I discovered, HDTVs have even worse speakers than older CRT televisions.)  I resolved this problem by buying a soundbar which is known for its great speech reproduction.  I'm actually glad I got the soundbar, because it makes EVERYTHING sound a heck of a lot better -- but in this day and age, there's no reason why people with hearing problems should have to resort to expensive workarounds.  (And without closed captions, what will I do in ten years when my hearing is worse and even the soundbar won't help?)

The other thing to be aware of is that these DVDs don't seem to play on computers.  At least, they don't on mine.  Your mileage may vary.

All those caveats aside, these episodes are a lot of fun.  As others have noted, the transfers have some odd color here and there, but that's unfortunately par for the course.  Many classic TV shows have the same issue.  Hopefully you'll be having so much fun watching Steed and Mrs. Peel cavort through one weird murder after another, that you won't notice.  If you can deal with the issues I mentioned earlier, then sit back and let Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg take you back to a time and place that was both simpler and more charming.",1395360000,,2033,4.437837837837838

As I watched this as a teenager in the sixties, I was so enthralled by Diana Rigg, and was so young that I missed a great deal of the wit in the series. And parodies of other spy dramas... Of course, in 1967, all of us caught the jab at the ABC TV series BATMAN. But now, watching as an old adult, I've caught quite a few little asides made by Steed or Emma, and directed towards the viewer, breaking the glass wall...very subtle, but there...Rigg's first Xmas episode in glorious black and white, opening Steed's greeting cards finding one simply signed ""Cathy""- Mrs. Gayle, Steed's first partner. Patrick McNee takes the card and talking  to himself-and us:""Ah, Mrs. Gayle, postmarked from Fort Knox! What can she be doing there?""  Well, Honor Blackman, who portrayed  Mrs. Gayle, left the Avengers to become a Bond Girl in ""GOLDFINGER"" as Ms. Galore...I thought that a neat little treat. In another episode, the proprietor of the barber shop is "" Todd Sweeny"", and so it goes.... And of you watch even a bit carefully, you'll see some unbelievable continuity gaffes...Steed in immaculate brown Edwardian suit...in the next scene he visits the lair of the bad guy, Dr. Frank N. Stone(played by Christopher Lee, life long friend of McNee) all decked out in a grey striped suit , but as he leaves, he's back in the brown suit. Lots of costume errors on both characters, but the stories are still well worth watching..Outdated yes, but a fond memory of the era. And you'll spot many soon to become British film and TV celebrities as they started out.  I cannot recommend this set more highly, especially to all you other boomers! It's a shame the big screen revival of THE AVENGERS  did not do well in reintroducing the genre to the new melinnieum.
 Note that just recently a hoax on the Internet claimed that McNee had died Feb. 28 (2014). Nope, he is 92 and enjoying a semi retirement(till the next guest spot offer comes in!) living in Palm Springs. I was surprised to learn he became an American citizen long before he went to the UK to portray John Steed!  And Diana Rigg is now Dame Diana Rigg, still involved in theatre and acting, at age 75. Her daughter is British actress Rachel Stirling.",1394150400,,2550,4.542483660130719

1627214,5,B00005MKOL,"After reading other reviews I was pleasantly surprised at what I received: a box holding two DVD cases in slip sleeves. The cases held each DVD in it's own, swing out plastic page. All the disks were firmly in place when I opened the cases.

Okay, these are dupes from the original magnetic tapes that recorded the film of the shows, and an occasional dirt fleck appears on the screen. Probably these tapes were made for syndication purposes for TVs of the sixties and seventies. If your are old enough, theaters presentations all had these dirt flakes on the print, even though the later theater projects employed special running cleaners.

The DVDs were not remastered from original negatives or prints, because the originals probably don't exist. This has occurred many times in the Movie Industry (e.g., ""Catch 22"" and ""Mash"" feature films, which were put together from prints, negatives, and collections.) Of course one could remaster this show digitally, but the price of the DVDs would likely be two or three hundred bucks or more per collection. I'm also guessing there are not enough fans of the show willing to pay such a high price.

As to these DVDs, the Dolby 2 stereo sound is flawless on my high-end audio system on the few I've played from the oldest B/W to the latest full color.

These, in my opinion, considering all factors, are excellent, not to mention, lots of fun watching the two of them doing their things.",1394064000,,1432,4.762096774193548

Each disc is fitted onto its separate hub, and each disc hub is mounted on a separate plastic ""page"" that allows easy flipping through, disc by disc.  The discs are securely fit on their hubs, so none came off in shipping.  None of the discs are scratched at all.  Perfect shape!  There have been other, excellent and positive reviews of the shows themselves, including sound and visual transfer.  I share these positive sentiments.

The only reason I bought this set is because I lost my previous collections of the individual season sets.

Not a precursor, nor a prototype, rather one idea that was in mode at the end of the 60's.
Detectives behavior got to be cool, risky taker, driving expensive car's. In fact Diana Rigg became a Bond girl.
  After two seasons Diana Rigg left the show and the world audience was disappointed with the new Avengers girl, Tara King.

1627446,3,B00005MKOL,"My big sister introduced me to The Avengers over 40 years ago. We both have a few episodes on VHS, but not a complete set. When I saw the great price on this DVD set I thought I'd get one for myself and one for my sister as a Christmas gift. I hesitated since the reviews of the packaging were so bad, but since nobody had serious issues with the DVDs themselves I decided to go ahead and order two sets and put the discs in slim jewel cases if the packaging was as bad as people said.

Oh boy, the package was even worse than I expected! Whoever designed it didn't have using the DVDs in mind when they made it. Four sections each contain four discs stacked on top of each other so you have to remove three to get to the fourth. In both sets, five discs were loose (none scratched, fortunately). I think they were not properly inserted in the first place, because the remaining 11 discs were locked in with an iron grip which required a good deal of patience to remove without damaging them. It took me a good 20-30 minutes to transfer each set to slim jewel cases.

I won't review the show itself, since I'm assuming you're familiar with it if you're interested in buying it. The DVDs themselves (of the ones I've gotten to so far) play properly and look OK. The video quality varies somewhat from one episode to another. Some look very clear, some look kinda grainy or even slightly faded, but overall the quality is quite acceptable. I compared some episodes on this set to the VHS tapes I already had, and they looked about the same. The lower resolution of the tapes, however, tended to soften any imperfections, while the DVDs higher resolution made some flaws a bit more obvious.

Bottom line, this is a great value for the money, even with the added cost of transferring the discs to new jewel cases. The episodes are as enjoyable as ever, and that's what counts.",1386979200,,1872,4.389048991354467

The packaging is the worst I've experienced and I've purchased many many DVDs, Blu Ray discs and collector / box sets.  Upon receipt before I even opened the package I knew there was a problem.  I could hear several discs sliding around inside the box.  After opening the box 12 of the 16 discs were lose in the plastic translucent container.  Not very happy about this.  All those discs sliding around during transit and handling along with the hard spindles inside the box caused plenty of damage.  Really disappointed with this set.

1627497,5,B00005MKOL,Emma Peel - the first female action heroine.  This series is clever - witty - entertaining - and - exceptional on all counts.  The chemistry between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg is truly what makes this series work.  The scripts are innovative and entertaining - just enough offbeat without becoming corny.  I've enjoyed this series for many years - and - expect to do so for many years to come.  p.s.  I have not yet seen the earlier series with Honor Blackman - but - can unequivocally say that the follow-on series with Linda Thorson was a major disappointment - both - in terms of script writing and her acting abilities.

I thought to replace them with used versions since they were out of print, but to my surprised the used copies cost enough for down payment on a car!  Netflix ran them steaming for a spell, but then pulled them.  The only way to see them on Netflix is order the DVD -- tedious and tiresome.

And when I saw this at just over $42 I had to have it. Of course, I just got it not to long ago but so far the quality of the discs seem to be good. Slight flutters and fluctuations in picture but that is to be expected. The show was shot in England and they are at different standards from ours. Our television signal was at 30 frame per second and theirs is 25. So the broadcast standards are different Then there is the fact that they are crossing international lines of commerce.

1627569,5,B00005MKOL,"Holy crap, Batman! The full Emma Peel set in a compact case and affordable. Lionsgate has been bitched about for releasing without remastering but they don't really have to if the titles are good in the first place. Their Miramax Blu-rays are very good so why fix it if it ain't broke?

Not having seen the originals these appear to be exact copies of the A&E, they even have their logo on the menus.

Quality is very good except for some interlacing.

Now let's talk about the packaging. Much more compact than the A&E box set so it fits nicely on the shelf. However, all of the discs are two to a hub and the offset stacking means you have to take the top two out before you can access the bottom discs. If you look at the pictures in the listing you'll see what I mean. Half of the discs are on two hinged holders.

A word of caution, they do lock to the front and back but, when I did that I noticed a couple of the lower discs had come off and were rattling around when I closed the case. From the looks of it the hub on the hinged holder lines up with the one on the inside cover so it presses against it causing the disc to pop off. No damage but didn't happen when I didn't lock them.

As with most A&E DVD sets there is no subtitles or Close Captioning. I haven't watched all episodes but did check all the discs for the additional features and the all had small still galleries. An interesting feature on the '67 set was a resume feature from the main menu. The discs are not labeled as to what season they are and the back cover only lists the episodes per disc.

As was mentioned in other reviews, the coveted 17th disc is missing. I can see it listed for about $20, used, so you might be taking a chance. Can see one on ebay for $69, also used.

Kind of wish A&E had kept this and remastered like they did with The Prisoner. Did a side by side with their original release and there is really no comparison. It's absolutely beautiful and well worth the cost.

Of course there is the Optimum Complete Avengers with all seasons (except the ""New Avengers""). Rumor has it there were some issues with some discs but, they were exchanged by Optimum.

Any way I do highly recommend if you are an Emma Peel fan.

UPDATE:

Got the Optimum set from Amazon UK. Really beats this set by a country mile. The transfers are sharper and no interlacing as far as I can tell. Here's the thing. The first three seasons were not shown here in the 60's. As they were shot on video, they were not up to the US standards as most of our shows were filmed and Soap Opera were on tape. As a result the forth to sixth were shot on film and shown here.  The only release for the earlier seasons was on the original A&E videos. Seriously, if you don't care about getting the full Avengers experience, stick with this set.

The interesting thing about this set is that it includes the last Emma Peel episode which was not the last of season 5 but the first of season 6 with Linda Thorson. If you don't have the last season you're kind of left hanging.

You can still find the last season on ebay but, it's going for twice this one and really wasn't as good as these. That, however, is just my humble opinion.

1627570,3,B00005MKOL,"Having loyally watched almost all of these episodes when they were first broadcast in the 60s, I was surprised that I do not like the collection more. Steed and Mrs. Peel are still enormously cool, but the stylized plots have simply not aged well. An unexpected delight has been recognizing actors playing bit parts who in later decades had success in BBC series and even playing villians in some of the Bond flicks.

Seeing the programs now has caused me to reflect upon the fact that from the 60s to the 80s, I apparently dated and/or married only women who resembled Mrs. Peel. Go figure.",1382313600,,591,4.628571428571429

1627572,4,B00005MKOL,"I was 14 years old when The Avengers premiered Monday nights on ABC.  Since I was already a big fan of other British series like The Saint and Secret Agent, I decided to watch it.  I enjoyed it to some degree but it was a little bit too off the wall for me so I discontinued watching after several episodes.  For the next couple years my history with the series was the same.  ABC would bring it back as a replacement series, I would watch some episodes before giving up and going somewhere else.  (I actually think I might have enjoyed the Tara King episodes more since Linda Thorson and myself were fairly close in age and I had a nice crush on her.)
Anyway I really did not think too much about The Avengers until about 20 years later when WABC in New York started showing them latenights at about 2 or 3 in the morning.  I would tape them on my VCR and watch them back without the commercials.  There were a few annoying things going on in my life at the time and I can't tell you how much I started enjoying this show again and recognizing it for the classic it was: an immensely imaginative series that held up greatly. When things got difficult, I would get such great enjoyment out of watching them.
When I saw that this series was going on sale, I ordered immediately.  (I already purchased most of the Tara King episodes on DVD years ago.)  I tend to agree with many others that the packaging is poor.  Many of the discs were loose and I hate the idea of pronging  the discs in two disc sets back to back.  I have only watched one episode so far, (""Return of the Cybernauts"" with the great Peter Cushing,) and the quality seems adequate: nothing great, but better than other old tv series on DVD  I've seen.
In conclusion, this is a very nice set featuring all the episodes starring the stunning Diana Rigg.  It is worth getting, but the packaging could have been so much better.",1382227200,,1889,4.314447592067989

As for the episodes they are as good and sometimes better than I remember, especially the B & W ones, whether your an original fan or a newbie wondering what the fuss it about, this set is essential.  Pure escapism, from a time when TV shows were made for everyone of any age or background to enjoy, no CGI or pointless end of season climaxes, arguably the greatest show ever made.",1382140800,,793,4.351351351351352

I have to agree with a previous comment  on the packaging case, it is poor, too many discs jammed in the one case.

A great set, no doubt about it. I am still watching it through for the first time and hanging on every episode. The writing is classically creative, the situations border on the whimsical and sometimes depraved side of science fiction and Steed and Emma just make it rock!

1627612,5,B00005MKOL,"Like many fans of the show, I managed to miss the boat on the first two DVD releases of this program  but I did painstakingly buy them all one set at a time. When I saw that it was going to be re-issued a third time, I jumped at the chance if for no other reason to free up about a foot and a half  of shelf space for a slimmer single box.

I don't believe these were re-mastered but the quality was fine for me. I tend to look for details like fine texture in wood or even hair in beards, and chips in paint. I am three discs into it and I'm pleased with the quality of the source (yes, if may be the same digital files as the two earlier releases). I was briefly put off by the stark back and white of the original opening which seemed over-bright, but the brightness of the episodes was fine.

There were very few imperfections in the source material that I could see. Sound quality was satisfactory.

The source material is great - whether or not the stories are straight-forward or outlandish, they are fun and they are well executed by an able cast of secondary actors supporting Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg.

Of course, doesn't every guy want to have John Steed's style and work with Emma Peel???

I'm happy with the set, and yes, and if they eventually re-release it in Blu-Ray, I'll buy it again.",1381708800,,1307,4.245967741935484
1627613,5,B00005MKOL,"I've always loved this show since I saw it as a kid so I'm happy to get all the Emma Peel episodes at a great price. Looks like all Lionsgate has added to the party is their logo. It would have been nice to include at least some of the additional stuff from the missing 17th disc or better yet new interviews with Steed, Gale, Peel and King.

I give this 5 stars strictly for the show but the packaging was responsible for more than half the discs being loose when I opened the case. I've moved them all to a dvd album now when I would have preferred to see 8 2-disc slimline cases in a cardboard slipcase. Now I have to find some way to repurpose this monstrosity with 8 posts. Could have been worse, I suppose, if they'd stuck all 16 dvds on one big centerpost.

 The bad packaging makes me reconsider whether I'll buy an Honor Blackman or Linda Thorson Megaset.",1381622400,,864,4.224242424242425
1627614,4,B00005MKOL,"I really cannot give this a poor rating, because of it's packaging or video quality. The set contains every episode Emma Peel was in. The video quality is not spectacular, but not too bad. My dad originally bought me some VHS tapes a long time ago and they were bad. This is a big improvement for my collection. When this was first advertised, the description said it came with the bonus disc. Amazon mixed the A&E box set up with this one(Which this set is made by Lions gate, Not A&E).Now the packaging
is terrible, when i received my set and all the discs fell out. there could have been better options for repackaging these discs. Here is an example, I really liked how the Secret agent man(aka Danger Man) was repackaged. I really want them to release the complete series.

1627635,1,B00005MKOL,"This set is simply a re-release of the original A&E megaset, this time without the bonus 17th disc! Hence the 1 star!  The series itself gets 5*. I have made comments about this on others' reviews but have decided to post this in the hope that a US distributor will take notice and release the new restored prints. American fans deserve it!

In the UK & Europe all the series/seasons of the original Avengers (not the NEW) have been re-released with completely new transfers and complete restoration and looks absolutely stunning. The series has NEVER looked better. There is hope of Blu-ray releases in the near future. This will be great as the series from Diana Rigg onwards was shot on 35mm film. The sets also contain archive material never released before (including small reproductions of the original ""promo"" booklets that were sent to the press to advertise the upcoming season). Plus new interviews with Honor Blackman on her season sets. She has been tremendously supportive of these releases and did the chat-show circuit at time of release in UK to promote them. There are also commentaries on each set from various directors and on some sets by writer/producer Brian Clemens. On the Diana Rigg B&W set (series 4) there is the bonus of the ""armchair theatre""  tv-play called ""the Hothouse"". This was the play that directly led to her being cast as Emma Peel. Plus on the same set there is an audio interview with Elizabeth Shepherd, the original Emma Peel, who gives her version of why she was let-go and the part re-cast. I found this fascinating to hear.  (There is a ""complete"" set available that comes in a briefcase-style packaging and contains everything but it is VERY pricey!)

I think there are rights issues (isn't this always the case?!) preventing these from being released in USA. Interestingly the cover for this ""new"" set is taken from one of the re-released UK sets. There is obviously still mileage in using the old prints, whoever is selling them, until the rights expire! So until someone new buys the rights and issues the new prints with all the extras the US will be stuck with the old prints. Not satisfactory at all but there you go i'm afraid!

Update: also see new update below (( :WARNING!! if you have a multi-region player and are thinking of buying from UK be careful. The individual 1st releases of series 2/4/5/6 contained audio or video glitches on certain discs -all discs on original set 5- and disc replacements were made available from manufacturer ""Optimum Releasing (UK) Ltd"". (The ""complete set"" has all the corrected discs). Amazon UK withdrew the faulty individual sets and are ""supposed"" to be selling corrected sets but recently some customers report that they have received a faulty set! So the manufacturer may still be sneeking through faulty sets!! As Steed might say ""Bad Show!""))

****NEW UPDATE APRIL 2014*******. The new stock on Amazon UK, by all accounts, now contains the corrected discs. However, If buying from one of the amazon sellers you may be buying an old 1st issue set. If you are willing to accept some audio/video faults on one or 2 discs (sets 2/4/6) or on ALL the discs (set 5) then you may feel it worth the lower price. If not only buy new stock direct from Amazon UK itself. Please also be aware that the sets do NOT have subtitles-I know that is important for many. Hope this helps!",1381449600,,3367,4.75513698630137

So you'll see some compression artifacts, color noise, low-contrast B&W video. Audio seems fine. I assume this is a re-release of previous version, and no worse than that.
I ignored the Bonus DVD description because the packaging and description says 16 dvds (bonus dvd would be 17), so I didn't expect that.
However, the Amazon description does say Thinpaks - the super thin dvd cases which can hold up to 2 discs (one in each side). Instead they used clamshell packaging with 4 ""pages"", 2 spindles each. The spindles sandwich 2 discs together, overlapping another 2 disc spindle. Like everyone else, there were discs swimming loose in my case, some looking scratched but luckily were just markings that could be rubbed off. Yeah, saves maybe an inch of space overall, but what this really shows is how the industry feels the once mighty DVD is a disposable commodity - so much for the 100 year life span of DVDs.",1381449600,,1033,4.84180790960452
1627638,2,B00005MKOL,"If I were rating this solely on the series itself, 5 stars wouldn't be enough. The Avengers is clever and fun and after 50 years still holds its own against anything on TV.

But this 2013 release is a mess thanks to both A&E and Amazon. First, A&E inexplicably chose to leave out the bonus features that were included in the previous 2006 release, a poor decision only made worse by Amazon's mistaken advertising of said features, leading their customers to believe they were getting something that was not there. It's bad enough that Amazon lumps reviews of different releases into one confusing heap, so that it becomes a major research project to discern what people have said about successive releases of DVDs, but now they're recycling product descriptions of content that has gone missing.

Secondly, A&E tried to reinvent the wheel and come up with a single small case to hold all sixteen discs they did include (sans bonus features disc). I appreciate space-saving packaging, but you need to make sure the thing actually works. The design of this package is such that opening it tends to pop discs off the spindles and fling them out like throwing stars. Does no one test these things before mass producing them? It takes all of two seconds to spot the design flaw, and I'm tempted to get out my X-acto knives to fix the ridiculous things myself.

So, here's my rating: series, 15 stars; bonus features, -5 stars; packaging, -1 star; product description, -1 star. That averages out to the 2 star rating given above.",1381449600,,1523,4.761363636363637

1627641,5,B00005MKOL,"I have loved this show since its first run in the 60's. The chemistry and partnership of these 2 was so special then and now. When this came out on VHS from A&E I couldn't wait to  get them but they weren't cheap and did not have the means to get all of the  Emma Peel set when they were released. I would look for them the past few years occasionally but when I had any means they were still too expensive a luxury and stopped looking aftera while.

I was so happy to see this coming out now at such a reasonable price. I am concerned though about the packaging. I plan on taking my time to watch these so I won't know for awhile if they are damaged aside from looking for obvious scratches.

Four of the discs were not snapped into their holders at all so have been loose and moving around the whole time they were in transit. That seems to be all that was needed,once snapped in they stay tight. It doesn't appear that they could have just fallen out. Unless the whole thing was thrown hard at one point I don't see how they could have come out on their own, so it appears to be an issue of quality control at the initial manufacturing/packaging point. I have other sets with multiple discs that use the method  these use and have had no issue with them though it does make for more handling to get the one you want to see and replace one you have just finished.

In addition the cardboard box it shipped in was not taped shut at one end, the whole thing could have fallen out and been lost. For such a treat as this set is and the joy it will bring to see them again a bit of extra care ensuring their safety is all that is needed, not a whole revision of the packaging.",1381363200,,1674,4.103975535168196
1627642,4,B00005MKOL,"The long awaited return of The Avengers Emma Peel Mega-set comes not a moment too soon. ""The Avengers"" is one of the seminal programs in television history. A part of the British wave into America during the 1960s, the show featured Patrick Macnee as the always dapper, indefatigable John Steed and the lovely Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel, the ""muscle"" of the team as it were. The unique chemistry between the two actors along with the beautiful photography, adventurous story-lines and ""diabolical masterminds"" made ""The Avengers"" one of the most popular shows during its era.

The episodes themselves need no review as loyal fans know them by heart while those new to ""The Avengers"" can discover the humor, action and unique atmosphere that is delivered in all 51 separate episodes. I will state that the first season of black and white or monochrome episodes are generally superior, but that is a matter of taste. The best monochrome episodes include, ""Quick Quick Slow Death"", ""The Gravediggers"", ""The Hour that Never Was"", ""Honey for the Prince"" and two favorites, ""A Touch of Brimstone"" featuring Mrs. Peel in a barely-there outfit and ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" which may be the best of the lot.

The move to color for the second set of episodes includes favorites such as, ""From Venus with Love"", ""The Winged Avenger"", ""The Hidden Tiger"", ""Death's Door"" and the highly unique episode ""Epic"" which is either the best they've ever done or the worst depending on your point of view. The final episode ""Forget-Me-Knot"" was actually filmed during the following season, but served as an introduction to Tara King, Steed's new partner as Diana Rigg left the series.

Long out of print from A & E, the original Emma Peel Mega-set along with the separate volumes that were sold individually fetched a very high price, even the individual volumes were more expensive that this new, complete package. So, perhaps the best aspect is the price itself which makes it very affordable for those who have yet to experience the pure joy of these episodes. Admittedly, it would have been nice to include more information about the episodes themselves, behind the scenes or other extras, but considering the price such expectations are rather beyond the intention of this particular set.

However, and this cannot be stated strong enough, the overall packaging is quite poor. When the set arrived four of the DVD discs were loose and bouncing around inside the plastic box. Because there are sixteen discs, they are stacked two-deep in each holder with one set above the other. This means that to pull out the bottom disc, you have to remove three DVDs first. Also, the discs do not fit well into the plastic box in the first place.

Barring a move to Blu-Ray, which would certainly reduce the number of discs, a better solution would have been to provide 8 two-disc thin plastic holders within a larger cardboard box, much like the ""Monty Python Mega-set"". While that is hardly a perfect solution, it would be far better than this mess, so I'm docking this package one star. However, this should not reflect on the show itself which is still glorious and a must-see for all Avenger fans and those who may only know Diana Rigg from her recent appearances on ""Game of Thrones"".",1381276800,,3259,4.864864864864865

1627690,3,B00005MKOL,"I discovered the Avengers in the mid-1970s when I was a teen. (It was shown at obscenely late hours on a then-unknown Atlanta cable station called WTCG, just purchased by Ted Turner who would turn it into TBS.) Fell head over heels in love with Steed AND Mrs. Peel. I wanted to be her; she was perfect. And I wanted to go places with him. His imperterbability on those wild adventures was heavenly, his charm, his taste in clothes divine, and who didn't want a brolley with a built-in saber or a bowler with a steel plate inside?

In later years I saw the Tara King stuff and later still, the girls who'd come first. But Mrs. Peel and Steed went together for me like chalk and cheese, as they say. So I had to get this set.

The adventures are very much as I remember--kooky and wild and often psychedelic. Mrs. Peel is still the ultimate lady--who's still able to rip a guy's head off without breaking a nail. Steed is still the perfect gentleman who can get knocked into a cactus and still look good. (And how can you not love a man who'll shoot Santa Claus?) I love this show and can foresee a long time of watching these adventures. Funny, sexy, silly, totally unrealistic and just plain fun escapism into a land where dreams attack you and cats are really tigers. Makes me want to wear a suit and a bowler and drive around in a Bentley or go ride dressage.

Video quality--what I've seen so far, anyway--is good. Not great, but good. I'm surprised the set does not seem to have been remastered. In the color (colour??) episodes the tones are a little off and occasionally they blur into one another. Sound is good; again not great. Loses one star for not being cleaned up a little better. But then for under $40 maybe we shouldn't expect that much.

But where they lose me is on packaging. Oh good heavens. Everything is in one ungodly thick plastic box, eight disks per bi-fold section, four facing each other. They're piled on top of each other; two disks stacked on each side. Which means if you want to watch disk #4 (or #8, #12 or #16) you've got to pry out the 3 disks above and astride it. Now picture this--you open the box and five disks are already disengaged and falling out. It's horrible--more impractical than some of the shows' plots! So far I haven't come across any scratches, but after all that rattling about I thought one of the disks must have shattered, so I wouldn't be surprised if one (or more) of them is messed up. Boo to the packaging. Even Star Trek TNG from a few years back had better packaging than this, and it required fighting with it for five minutes to get the box open. The Avengers packaging you fight to get the box open, fight to get the dvds out, and since you have to slip them UNDER part of the section joint to replace them, it takes an act of Congress to get them back in the box (and you know how successful acts of Congress are).

So, summary: if you're a high-def nut, you'll be disappointed; if you just want the show looking pretty much as you remembered, it's fine. But there's no way ANYONE can approve of the packaging. It's a nightmare and would leave even the unflappable Steed and Peel hysterical and crying for ""mother."" (Or was he not until Tara? memory fails.)",1381104000,,3225,4.3953098827470685
1627691,4,B00005MKOL,"Coming our way on October 8 of 2013, they could have called this ""The Complete Emma Peel Megaset: Take 3,"" as this is the third time the Emma Peel episodes have been collected into a single package.  I'm a bit concerned about this version only being 16 discs, though.  The first Megaset (released in 2001) was a 16 disc collection that simply gathered together the eight double DVD volumes that had previously been released.  Then came the second Emma Peel Megaset (2006) that came with a bonus 17th DVD full of AVENGERS rarities:  The surviving footage from the very first AVENGERS episode ""Hot Ice,"" some vintage AVENGERS promos, and the two surviving Dr. King/Dr. Keel episodes (""The Frighteners"" and ""The Girl on the Trapeze""), a 1992 half-hour documentary (""Avenging the Avengers""), as well as a 1977 episode of THE NEW AVENGERS that featured a flashback cameo by Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel.  Surprisingly, that 17th disc seems to be missing from this new triple-dip of the Emma Peel collection.  (To A&E's credit, they sold the bonus 17th DVD on its own for the benefit of customers who had already purchased the earlier releases.  These days that disc shows up online for about $45...three times its original price.)  Have those bonus goodies been incorporated as extras on the 16 discs, or simply been abandoned this time around?",1380153600,,1333,4.8933333333333335
1627692,5,B00005MKOL,"I was seven years old when my parents said, ""There's a show on you might like -- it's called THE AVENGERS."" And wow, were they ever right! I watched those color episodes being run on the U.S. ABC network and was totally captivated. In my late teens I watched the series again, rerun as part of the CBS LATE MOVIE (in those pre-David Letterman days), while the videotape revolution of the '80s brought me many of the black-and-white Mrs. Peel episodes I had never seen, with A&E offering a complete run of the series, from Cathy Gale through Tara King, in the early '90s. (By that time, THE AVENGERS had forever spoiled James Bond for me -- who can suffer the mysogynist Bond when one can watch the urbane Steed going through life with a smile always on his face and a good-looking lady always on his arm?)

Given that background, it's no surprise I have the complete run of AVENGERS (and its '70s successor, THE NEW AVENGERS) on disc on my shelves; around the major holidays I tend to select an episode and stay hugely entertained for the better part of an hour. While in Britain the Cathy Gale episodes are still very highly regarded, and many in France consider the Linda Thorson run the creme de la creme, for us Yanks it's the Mrs. Peel years that represent the quintessential AVENGERS ... and it is delightful to know they will be once more available to entertain 21st century audiences.

If you like understated humor -- if you can enjoy the ambiguity of not knowing if the lead couple are ""doing it"" -- if you can accept a certain degree of camp, always made palatable by the deft work of Patrick Macnee, Diana Rigg, Brian Clemens, Albert Fennell, and their guest stars and directors -- if you'd like to see an early televised example of feminine equality (MAD MEN viewers, project into that atmosphere the effect a character like Mrs. Peel would have on the women -- and men! -- of the 1960s) -- and if you can accept the fact that action sequences have evolved in fifty years, but that these represented a high-water mark for the '60s (and several still hold up -- the Steed/Cartney duel in the episode, ""A Touch of Brimstone"" is exceptional!), then you'll definitely want to meet THE AVENGERS, or be reintroduced if you don't already have this series in your home.

By the way, my favorite episodes include ""The Gravediggers,"" ""Silent Dust,"" ""Quick-Quick Slow Death,"" ""The House That Jack Built,"" ""Escape in Time,"" ""The Bird Who Knew Too Much,"" ""The Correct Way to Kill,"" ""The Joker,"" ""Who's Who?"", and ""Dead Man's Treasure"" ... feel free to stack your favorites up against mine!

Now that the series is released on DVD at a reasonable price, I think I will treat myself to an upgrade;  if nothing else, it's only a matter of time before no-one's making videotape players any more.
I grew up in the UK, and was aged 7-10 when this series was shown.  Several reviewers have credited the BBC with this production, but in fact it was one of the UK's commercial channels which produced it - ABC I think.  I remember how everyone in my household - from my grandparents down - was infected by the show's quirky humor from a cast of eccentric characters, both the heroes and the villains, as well as the various interlopers.  It always seemed that everyone in the house was in a silly but cheerful mood after watching an episode of 'The Avengers', most especially during the Emma Peel years.  I loved the imagination behind all the plots, then and now.  In fact, that's the essential difference between these old shows and the sorry selection available today;  it seems everything today has to be 'reality-based', such that everyone is supposed to turn on their TV to embrace reality.  In the old days, people turned on their TV to escape reality.  And I still do, hence I'm still watching all the old shows that indulge that sentiment: The Avengers, The Prisoner, Star Trek, Mr Ed, The Ghost and Mrs Muir, Dr Who, etc.
Old-fashioned heroes take on old-fashioned villains; the kind who we're impressed to believe were not so much evil, just mischievous; almost lovable, in a perverse way.  My favorite Avengers' episode was 'The Joker'; where Emma was lured to the country home of an old friend for a weekend, only to arrive and be told by an eccentric and eerily sinister young maid that the master of the house was 'away for day or so', but she was welcome to stay and wait for him.  But Emma soon became aware that she was being watched, in a house full of foreboding worthy of Hitchcock!  That episode alone, plus the timeless 'Touch of Brimstone' (not shown in the US; not sure if that was active or passive censorship) make the whole series worthy of the purchase price.
A little trivia;  The Avengers was written by Brian Clemens, who I recently learned shares a 19th Century ancestor with Mark Twain (yes, THE Mark Twain!).  Mr Clemens also wrote another excellent UK series 'Thriller', also available from Amazon, or for rent from Netflix (this was a 1973 production, not to be confused with the earlier US series featuring Boris Karloff).  And the name Emma Peel?  According to credible legend, one of the essential requirements for the character was that she must 'appeal to men'; the secretary taking notes in short hand at that meeting wrote that as 'need M Appeal' - and the name came from that!
I'm so glad that this has been released on DVD.  Thank you Amazon for making it available at an affordable price!",1377216000,,2937,4.604606525911708

1627718,5,B00005MKOL,I was a young boy when this series first was on TV and I found John Steed to be quite witty and Emma Peel quite sexy and sophisticated. Now at age 59 I see I was correct in both cases.,1377043200,,184,3.625
1627719,4,B00005MKOL,"I was 13 years old in 1966 flipping through the 5 television channels then available when I came across the scene of a man dressed as a giant bird climbing the outside of a city building.  There was very little in the way of science fiction or comic book related video entertainment on television at the time so I eagerly kept watching.  I was lucky enough to have found an episode of The Avengers and, in one evening, became a lifelong fan of both that series and of British programming in general.

The Avengers ran from 1961 through 1969.  But the value of the stylish British import lies chiefly in the episodes that paired Diana Rigg with Patrick Macnee from 1965 to 1968.  Rigg had replaced Bond girl Honor Blackman as English superspy Emma Peel for the show's fourth season, the first to be available in the US, and nothing like her had ever been seen on the television screen.  The cat-suitted Peel used a kung fu fighting style to defeat England's enemies.  John Steed would occasionally draw a sword from his umbrella or raise a fist if forced by circumstance but the muscle of the team was the female lead.  When not tossing bad guys around the screen, Rigg's character was cultured, stylish and wonderfully intelligent.  It was virtually impossible for a 13 year old boy not to be entranced by Emma Peel.

In 1965, ABC paid the unheard of price of two million dollars for 26 episodes of The Avengers.  The series first aired from March to December 1966 in the 10:00 time slot because of subject matter deemed to be too mature in the States. There were in fact 5 shows that were held from distribution in the US (including Emma's appearance in a dominatrix outfit in ""A Touch of Brimstone"") because they were thought to be unsuitable.  Besides the obvious charms of Ms Rigg and the sparkling on screen chemistry between she and Macnee, The Avengers presented a perfect mix of adventure, humor and style.  The show is also a wonderful mirror of the times as Emma Peel represents the swinging London sixties scene contrasted with the Edwardian image of John Steed.  The Avengers looked like a Bond movie at times and satirized everything from The Man from UNCLE to Mission Impossible to Batman.  The look of the show was often cinematic and it took great care with its eccentric, secondary characters in a way reminiscent of Dickens.

The only reason I am giving one the favorite viewing experiences of my life 4 stars is that I am a bit disappointed by its release in standard format.  I'm not an engineer so I'm not sure that Blue Ray treatment would make a difference with a show produced in 1960 as some reviewers have suggested.  But I did purchase a Blue Ray version of The Prisoner last year, another BBC produced series from the same era, and found the color and clarity striking and surprising. I've waited a long time for a definitive version of The Avengers (possessing a carton of A&E VHS sets from the 90s) so the non Blue Ray release is a bit of a let down.

Make no mistake, though, I have pre-ordered this standard format DVD if for no other reason that its producers had the taste to break out the Emma Peel episodes, including her final, touching leave-taking of John Steed, into a stand alone set.  Younger viewers may be thrown by some of the period satires but should enjoy contrasting the young, sexy Diana Rigg with the matriarchal and no less compelling character she portrayed in the latest Game of Thrones season.  In any case, there are worse ways to spend your viewing time then watching the complete Emma Peel Megaset.  Put an episode on each Monday night at 10 for period accuracy or, if you fell for Mrs Peel like I did, clear the evening and settle in for an Avengers marathon.",1376784000,,3718,4.576168929110105

The Complete Emma Peel Megaset'

The Avengers - Diana Rigg in 'The Complete Emma Peel Megaset' Returns to DVD!
All 51 episodes starring Dame Diana are back on DVD this October.
Posted by David Lambert on 7/24/2013 at tvshowsondvd d o t com

Before she famously became the only woman to ever marry James ""007"" Bond in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, she was ""Emma Peel"" for 3 series (seasons) in the legendary U.K. program The Avengers. Now Dame Diana Rigg has come back into the spotlight with a recurring role as ""Lady Olenna Tyrell"" in Game of Thrones, as well as a guest role as ""Mrs. Gillyflower"" in the 2013 Doctor Who episode, ""The Crimson Horror"" (note that her character's daughter, ""Ada,"" is Rigg's real-life daughter Rachael Stirling). So what better time than now to re-introduced Emma Peel to DVD?

In early 2006, A&E Home Video released The Avengers - Emma Peel Collector's Edition on DVD, a 51-episode collection with all of Rigg's appearances in the show. It came on 16 discs, plus a bonus 17th disc featuring three previously ""lost"" episodes from the pre-Rigg era of the program. That item originally went for $179.95 SRP when it first came out, and was later reduced in cost to a $99.95 list price. However, it's been out of print for a long time now, and ""new""-condition copies can often go for HUNDREDS of dollars more than the original list price!

Today, A&E and their current distributor Lionsgate Entertainment informed retailers that on October 8th they will re-release these 51 episodes on DVD with The Avengers - The Complete Emma Peel Megaset. You'll get all 3 seasons with Diana Rigg as ""Emma Peel"" - 51 episodes - on 16 discs for just $49.98 SRP. The DVDs will come packaged in one big plastic case this time (the previous set used a whole slew of plastic cases, in volumes which were also sold separately, that slid into a cardboard box slipcase), with brand-new artwork featuring Sneed (Patrick Macnee) and Peel on the cover. It looks fantastic; check it out!",1374624000,,2231,4.7642487046632125
1627760,5,B00005MKOL,"These episodes of The Avengers represent the height of the series and showcase the character of Mrs. Emma Peel, perhaps the sexiest, most sophisticated heroine to grace television. Combined with John Steed's charm, the two encounter numerous suspenseful, well-written adventures in espionage. The series comes from a productive time in British television that also produced Danger Man, The Saint, and The Prisoner. As with these other shows wit and intelligence is prized over brute force. All in all an intelligent, entertaining, collection of episodes from a classic television show.",1374105600,,585,5.584269662921348
1627761,5,B00005MKOL,"It's all here folks, the entire list of episodes both b/w and color episodes.
My all-time favorite episodes including ""The House that Jack Built"" , The Cybernauts"" and sadly ""The Forget-Me-Knot"" (Dame Rigg's exit episode).
Although Linda Thorson tried....she was never able to fill Rigg's shoes.(Not to mention those cat-suits)  Sorry. That's my opinion. She was very good. But there is only one Emma Peel!",1372377600,,406,5.246153846153846
1627762,5,B00005MKOL,"In this household, on the topic of man appeal, yes there is indeed someone who finds the fabulous Ms. Rigg delightful, in many ways, but also, these episodes are so much better than the unfortunately dark (literally due to the transcription or original filming conditions etc.) and very menacing Honor Blackman vs. Patrick Macnee preceding ones. (They do seem to have animosity toward each other and at any rate it is not pleasant to watch their interactions for whatever reason.)

I have read that Rigg was a formally trained actress and having recently bought an old BBC DVD and watched her do ""Bleak House"" I can see how good she was in a ""serious"" role -- supposedly she did Mrs. Peel tryouts as a ""giggle""! Amazing.",1368057600,,720,4.714285714285714

1627764,5,B00005MKOL,"I love this DVD set.  It's so great to watch these episodes again.  Diana Rigg and Patrick MacNee are so perfect together, and I love to see the transition from the more formal, serious Emma in the black and white episodes to the more playful, sexy Emma in the color episodes.  Love the English scenery, and the pristine perfection of the entire series (no blood at murder sites, everyone perfectly dressed, even the bad guys, emaculate scenery). Watching this just takes me to another time and place.  Love it!",1364169600,,511,4.707865168539326
1627765,3,B00005MKOL,"The Avengers in its best and truest form. But, at the same time, sadly inconsistent.

To be sure, the first of these two long seasons from the show's middle period starts out in solid fashion -- absurd fun with wild plots, tart chemistry and an eclectic fashion sense. They strike the perfect tone -- less formal than the early Honor Blackman episodes, less daffy than the later ones with doe-eyed Linda Thorson, but with a bit of both.

And Rigg is a true English rose. Not to diminish her gifts as an actress (which are not inconsiderable), but this is  the only TV show I've ever watched in some part simply to breathe in the emphatic womanhood of one of its stars. Rigg's screen presence can't undo the ridiculous or close the gap between bad and good, but it can make the mediocre watchable.

And there's a fair amount of the mediocre here. The Megaset requires a very long walk on what proves too short a pier. The great episodes are very spread-out.  For example, there is far too wide a gap between the classic The Cybernauts on Disc 1 and the delightfully bizarre The Girl from Auntie on Disc 6 (a perfect example of how the right music can ramp up the mood) and then the truly creepy The House That Jack Built on Disc 8. Extended viewing tends to draw out the formula, and in too many episodes, it's mainly formula that is on display. The stories are often predictable and stretched-out, the end-of-episode fights are uniformly unconvincing, the staging is too often uniform (or close to it), flat and spiritless and the concepts quickly grow repetitive -- essentially a reduction of assorted English icons and stereotypes to a fixed 50-minute recipe.

Happily, the show gets better in the second season. There's a long, brilliant run of episodes beginning around Never, Never Say Die on Disc 12, with its wonderfully solemn performance by Christopher Lee. The addition of color does give the show a greater sense of depth, but also ramps up the kitschy, late-'60s feel and there's an odd formality about the production (summed up in the new ""We're needed"" sequences -- cute once, unbearably cutesy when repeated), as though the two stars had suddenly lost their easy way with each other. And we began to weary of the set long before it ended.

There -is- fun to be had herein, if you know where to look for it, and the extras disc includes everything you could want -- including Rigg's brief appearances on a New Avengers episode in the 1970s. (She turned down the invitation to reprise her role, so they used old footage instead. Classy!) But you'll have to search for the fun, and the downtime and the high price makes it a poor bargain.",1363910400,,2650,4.625531914893617
1627776,5,B00005MKOL,"Trust me--all Avengers fans need this.  Not necessarily because it's Mrs. Peel out the wazoo, but those 'lost' episodes from the very first Avengers series ever are on one of these DVDs.  I had scraped together my own EP collection, so I have most of these episodes.  However, you should just go for it if you find one in good condition for a decent price!

In my youth, in the '60s, I used to dash about the house, tossing my hair back off my face as Emma Peel did! Ah, to have been she--a dashing, beautiful super-spy who could more than hold her own with the gallant Steed! And she was better than he at the spying game--as women in non-traditional roles in the 1960's HAD to be, in order to be respected in the same (masculine) field. I am so grateful to have had Emma Peel as a role model, even as I struggled to rise beyond the diapers and dinner-making that my gender had channeled me into without really internalizing any other options. But Emma Peel taught me that I really could do anything, and eventually, I did! Two children, two husbands, two graduate degrees, and 20+ years of college teaching later, I am blessed in my retirement to again be able to dash about the house with the hero of my youth, tossing my hair off my aging face with a grin. And you young women who find Mrs. Peel's sly demure to Steed disgustingly subservient, look at the original broadcast dates again.",1345680000,,1291,5.297560975609756

1627785,5,B00005MKOL,"I was a teen when I first watched The Avengers. This entire set brought back feelings and memories that have lain dormant. Yet, it's not the nostalgia that makes this collection so engaging for me. Instead, it is the unfolding relationship between Mrs. Peel and John Steed. His dapper approach to all things was a perfect counterpoint to her underlying sensuality. For those who deny such things, just watch some of the fight sequences. They are neither particularly realistic nor brutal. They just engage the eye and the mind on that central female character. The Steed - Peel relationship was brought to a delicate and touching end in the last episode. What a terrific collection this is.",1285804800,,690,4.905982905982906

1627809,5,B00005MKOL,"It's so wonderful to be able to have DVDs of one of my favorite shows, ""The Avengers."" This is 2010, and I just heard there's a new movie coming out titled ""The Avengers.""  Imagine my disappointment when I found out it's about a group of comic book superheroes, and not a replacement for that horrible, miscast Avengers movie they made in the '90s. At least with these DVDs, I can still have fun with the Avengers I know as friends.

Unlike some, I like all five women in Steed's life: Cathy Gale, Emma Peel, Tara King, Lady Diana Forbes-Blakeney, and Purdy. I can still see Tara King assuming a stance in miniskirt and boots, blasting away with a machine gun. But no doubt Emma Peel is the best remembered, especially by Americans since she was the first Avenger we saw. All of Steed's women had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief. To my taste, they were some of the sexiest women to ever walk the earth.

One of the main reasons is that their sexuality was never overt, but always hinted at. The Amazon.com reviewer mentioned one example of the sexy banter between Steed and Mrs. Peel. Another one I remember quite well was in one of the black-and-white episodes when Mrs. Peel, wearing a somewhat low-cut evening gown, is going to visit a phrenologist (a person who reads character by the bumps on your head) to get some information out of him. Steed remarks, ""If that doesn't work, just show him your bumps."" Her mind elsewhere, she looks at Steed blankly and says, ""Hmmmmm?""",1271548800,,1539,4.650735294117647

1627811,5,B00005MKOL,"The British invasion of the 'sixties included not only music, but James Bond and all manner of English imports. Although The Avengers started as a black-and-white series starring Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman
(soon to become Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger""), the series really hit its stride and came ashore to America when Diana Rigg (Emma Peel) became the co-star in 1965. This boxed set includes every Mrs. Peel episode including one that did not originally air on ABC in America because of racy S&M undertones. The series was witty and intriguing with tongue placed firmly in cheek. The chemistry between Macnee and Rigg was perfect
and the scripts were ingenious. Whether investigating robots, possible alien invasion or shape-shifters, Steed and Peel always resolved mysteries with wit and a reasonable explanation. The musical score by composer
Laurie Johnson was the perfect complement to the proceedings on screen. This is the best version of the show (as opposed to the original version with Honor Blackman, ""The New Avengers"" sequel, or the attempted feature version with Ralph Feinnes and Uma Thurman.

It is a bit of science fiction, adventure, espionage and comedy mixed in altogether.  So fun, so exciting to watch.  Even the music is great and memorable.  The disk also contains a documentary on the show and several lost episodes from the 1st season and The New Avengers.  The lost episodes are pretty good but The New Avengers episode makes very little sense and is terrible.  During the documentary I was shocked to hear that Diana Rigg was disliked on the set except by Patrick Macnee and the things they say about Linda Thorson isn't so nice either.  The writers seem to feel sorry that when the show became bigger and financing was taken over by the US, they lost out.  Which they probably did.  I am glad that they were there to create this wonderful show but feel sad that they fail to recognize how great it really is and how great Diana Rigg was in the part of Emma Peel.

Chemistry between the partners is super, with more sexual tension than I remember (i was only 14 when Diana Rigg left the show).

Some of the sets are a little cheesy, and the editing leaves a bit to be desired (you can easily tell when a stunt double is being used). But, all in all, it's been great fun to watch again. Love the clothes, Steed's and Mrs. Peel's respective flats, and the tongue-in-cheek dialogues.

Especially love the relationship between the two - equal partners with complimentary skills. Steed is the old-school, debonair agent. Mrs. Peel, by contrast, is the hip, techno-savvy one.

The opening sequence never gets tiresome, nor does the theme music.

1627830,5,B00005MKOL,"What a woman! Beauty, martial arts skills, and, not least, brains. In an early episode we see Mrs. Peel working on a paper on thermodynamics. And when Steed has to take an intelligence test to infiltrate a Mensa-like organization, she feeds him the answers. (When she's asked her I.Q., she answers matter-of-factly, ""Well above average."" Obviously she's not the least bit concerned about being accused of elitism.)

And don't miss ""A Touch of Brimstone"" on disc 7. Like all the episodes, it's highly entertaining, with delightfully underplayed British humor -- but there's more: As the Queen of Sin, Diana Rigg will make your jaw drop and your eyes pop. She designed the outfit she wears -- it's so kinky that it, and the events that follow, resulted in the episode being banned from U. S. television. You can see it here for the first time.

The DVD quality is excellent in this set, which contains all 51 episodes in which Rigg appeared. Just one word of warning: the episode notes on the back of the individual DVD packs are wittily written, but they often contain plot spoilers, so it's best to enjoy them after viewing the program.",1228262400,,1136,4.761421319796955

Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee have a wonderful chemistry together on screen that has rarely been matched since. There is also a ""film noir"" quality to many of the episodes from the black and white years with ""Emma""...Castle Death, Too many Christmas Trees, Dial a Deadly Number, The Town of No Return and How to Succeed...at Murder among others all display the ""noir"" touch.
Before Closing I have to mention the bonus 17th CD thats contains a couple of the lost episodes of the very first season of the Avengers along with a third of another. I thought these shows were tremendous. I love live TV and thats what this was. A shame really that there are not more of them.

1627850,5,B00005MKOL,"The year was 1967, my mother waited up until 10:00 PM to watch a special program, religiously. As a very young child I was quite curious to see what the fuss was all about so one evening I stayed up late with anticipation and watched from the hallway , hidden from her. The program was THE AVENGERS and I was hooked. I don't think it took much persuasion, she obviously knew my high expectation on taste and allowed me to watch it with her. I was enthralled by the presence of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), she was sophisticated, witty and had true sex appeal. She was in a class all her own, wore the latest fashions and had the coolest pad in town. Diana Rigg, age 28, was selected from more than 80 actresses who auditioned for the part. She took the place of Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman) who later became the famous Bond girl Pussy Galore in GOLDFINGER. Femme fatal, Diana Rigg had true ""AMPPEAL"", prancing around in her fetish leather cat suits delivering pernicious karate chops and kicks to vengeful villians. She was the true Catwoman. Teamed with John Steed (Patrick Mc Nee) who started off as a producer, refined and dashingly dandy was the true meaning of the Renaissance Man. The perfect crime fighting pair with a Chelsea sense of humor taking on the most eccentric assassins, mad men, cybernetic villians, and even a man eating plant. This urbane couple had a taste for fighting crime with elegance and defending the free world, not to mention vintage wines and champagne. Business and pleasure never mixed so well. So you can always depend on THE AVENGERS for a first class punch. This one is a must for all you vintage collectors, I couldn't live without mine. Produced by Brian Clemens who later did the THRILLER series. Also, if you like THE AVENGERS you may also like THE PRISONER starting Patrick Mc Goohan.",1184976000,,1820,4.62037037037037

1627870,5,B00005MKOL,"I only recently got into The Avengers. I realize I am 40 years too late, but anyway, call it a sheltered life.  After countless emails from my buddy Keith Snowdon in England extolling the virtues of Emma Peel and Tara King, I decided to give it a try.  All I can say is what took me so long.  The Avengers has since become my second favorite television show. In case you are wondering, nothing can top Doctor Who.  The Avengers features Patrick Macnee as John Steed, the quintessential English gentleman who portrays a British security agent. Emma Peel is played by the lovely Diana Rigg, a 60s hottie indeed.

The concepts in The Avengers range from the bizarre to the fantastic.  From the very first episode in this set, The Town Of No Return (arguably the best story), the viewer will be on the edge of his seat, as a mystery will unfold, a threat to the nation's security, hostile take-overs by enemy agents with Russian and East German surnames, using fantastic devices such as dream-inducers, lying serums in milk, hypnotic trances, boots which allow the wearer to scale buildings, death rays that seem to originate from the planet Venus, and even a device planted inside cat tags to unleash the ferocious beast inside all cats!  Cat lovers take heart. No cat was harmed fictionally or otherwise in the making of that story. What I love about The Avengers is the silly (in a good way) comic relief sprinkled throughout each story to keep things from getting too intense.  Steed and Miss Peel interact very well, their timing impeccable.  Plus check out some of the outfits Emma wears. Very revealing for the 60s.

This is an Emma Peel DVD set, but let's not forget the Tara King era, featuring the curvy Linda Thorson.  The King era is not well-liked by fans, but it's only a slight drop-off from the Emma Peel era.  This era represents a change in The Avengers in that finally a boss figure is seen, a fat man named Mother who is confined to a wheelchair and is aided by a blond amazon who never speaks.  Only The Avengers can dream up concepts like this.

And being a fan of Doctor Who I love recognizing guest actors that have appeared in Who, and believe me there are plenty.  Even third Doctor John Pertwee had a limited guest role in From Venus With Love.  The only bad thing I can say about The Avengers is that the stories are limited in number. There are 51 Emma Peels in this set, and another 32 in the Tara King era, available on separate DVDs.  However, as with any show from the past, it eventually ended.  Fortunately, these stories are worth many repeated viewings. And who knows? Keith tells me the Cathy Gale era was pretty good too.  So maybe I will try those next.",1170547200,,2689,4.518595041322314

1627878,5,B00005MKOL,"I was a big fan of The Avengers as a kid and excited to see it available on DVD. Watching the show again brings back great memories. I don't often buy tv shows on DVD, but I consider the Complete Emma Peel Megaset (Collector's Edition) a good purchase--worth the money. Here are a few reasons why...

Sophisticated, witty writing makes this show a classic. As an adult, I've often been disappointed when I watch a show I loved as a kid. A lot of the time what was once fun and entertaining becomes stale and dated, or cheap special effects and poor execution become a distraction. Not true with The Avengers. Yes, special effects have come a long way, and the fight scenes are pretty silly, but the writing and acting is timeless and classic.

Digitally remastered. It's like watching the show for the first time. Again, great job A&E.

This is a great set! I must commend A&E for the way it produced the series for DVD distribution. Smart move. Like many, I was so happy to see a set that included, but was also limited to, all the episodes with Diana Rigg as Patrick Macnee's co-star. I was only interested in the shows with Diana Rigg. And, the set is organized by each show's original release date. (Whoever was responsible for producing the Space 1999 series for DVD release should have taken notes. Check out the product information and you'll see what I mean.)The Complete Emma Peel Megaset (Collector's Edition) also includes lots of extras.

Great price! At Amazon's 50% off the regular price (at least as of 5/08/06) the $89 seems like a bargain.",1147046400,,1556,4.606498194945848
1627879,5,B00005MKOL,"Previously released by A&E on DVD, ""The Avengers Emma Peel Megaset"" brings the episodes featuring Diana Rigg and Patrick MacNee as John Steed altogether in one complete smaller set with extras. You get all the episodes that Diana Rigg appeared in packed into 16 discs with 3 or 4 episodes per DVD. The DVDs are packaged in slimline cases making it a bit easier for storage purposes particularly if you have a lot of DVDs.

The big attraction for fans is the disc of ""Lost Episodes"" featuring 2 and 1/2 of the earliest episodes when the show first aired. Featuring Dr. Keel (Ian Hendry ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"") and John Steed fighting the bad guys. Hendry becomes involved with Steed and becomes an ""Avenger"" when his fiance is murdered. Unfortunately the rest of the first season episodes have vanished and these 2 1/2 episodes are all that remain of the first season. The first season tone is more serious than later ones. It would take another season before the show would finally hit its stride with the introduction of Dr Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman-Pussy Galore from ""Goldfinger""). As mentioned elsewhere this 17th disc is available separately so don't feel compelled to purchase the whole set again if you bought it in 2001.

Image quality is extremely good throughout. There is quite a bit of analog speckles and spots on some episodes but the blacks are rock solid and the colors despite a bit of fading looks extremely good as well on the later episodes. The image quality is a bit softer in the color episodes when compared to the earlier black and white episodes. Sound is solid throughout the set.

We also get ""Avenging The Avengers"" a short doucmentary on the series featuring Macnee, Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. ""The Strange Case of the Missing Corpse"" is a promotional short made to promote the show's move from black and white to color. We also get the alternate version of the opening of the show shot for America where the characters are on a chessboard. Finally we get The New Avengers ""episode K is for the Kill: The Tiger Awakes"". The reason we get it is a cameo by Diana Rigg. It's actually a scene from the 1967 season intercut with footage of Patrick Macnee speaking with Mrs. Peel on the phone. It's a bizarre and contrived cameo that came about when Diana Rigg turned down a request to appear on an episode of the show.

I was never a fan of ""The New Avengers"" the show just didn't have the wit of the previous one and was far more predictable. We only get the first half of this two part episode which is kind of a problem if you're interested in how it ends and don't want to go out and buy the set it's a part of.

While the earlier episodes are fine they can't match the later ones with Rigg for me simply because I grew up watching them and the writing on the show hit its stride. Mrs. Peel passes the mantel to Tara King in the last episode of the 16th disc. Linda Thorson did an admirable job in her role as Tara. Brian Clemens notes that he feels the writing was best in the last season of the show featuring Tara and Steed. While I would disagree the last season held it's own with the Rigg and Blackman years.

The image quality is to notch with occasional bits of flecking but is free of dirt. The episodes look terrific overall (although there is the occasional bit of damage to the original prints, etc. that crop up). The blacks look rock solid. The color episodes also look quite good although not quite as sharp. The colors pop (and have the dayglo look of pop art).

By the way other retailers are selling this set for significantly less than amazon.com so shop around. Costco has the set for $99.99 a big savings in the US!",1141948800,,3683,4.471726190476191

1627886,5,B00005MKOL,"I have had this precious set since it was first issued.

Informatively, I had the pleasure of seeing Diana Rigg in London, in the play, ""Lady Macbeth,"" many years ago.

I recall staying in a London Hotel when the Avengers were shown on television. In those days one had to rent a TV, as it was not stnndard equipment. I made it a point that where ever I was in the City to hail a taxi and return to the hotel as quickly as possible in order to see the scheduled Avengers program. This procedure lasted as long as it was scheduled.

Not long ago on BBC America, Diana Rigg was interviewed by Parkinson, a popular talk show host. Diana must have been in her Sixties. On her appearance she received a thunderous applause.

I was glued to the set. At her stage in life, she was most charming in addition to her intelligent and beautiful personna.

Every word she uttered was like music. One realizes how musical the English language is when spoken by Diana. Her interview was most interesting and sadly I do not possess a copy, but am checking the internet to locate a video of her interview.

Now to business:  Every episode in the collection is a treasure.

In every episode Diana Rigg assumes the appropriate role.  At the same time one is aware of the complete Diana Rigg persona.

Diana Rigg as Emma Peel does her own stunts, whereas her most compatable partner, Patrick Macnee uses a stunt man.

Being retired, and living a rather semi reclusive life, I have a daily routine that rarely varies. After looking at the evening news 6PM to 7PM, I must confess that I cannot help but be depressed.  In my mid 80's, as you can guess, I have seen much of the world abd was part of the events of the day. When I started this daily routine, at the completion of the news, I would sit quietly and ponder what was shown on the news.  Realizing that at my time of life there was nothing I could do but just witness the terrible things that were going on in the world in general.

One day, out of the blue, as they say, I chose an Avenger DVD,

of the Emma Peel collection.  What a delightful surprize.

I was shielded from the outside world, and for a too brief period, I was completely mesmerized. So, I made this a daily event for a number of years, and have enjoyed each episode, many times, with the same pleasure as my first viewing. At writing, I am looking forward to choose a DVD for this very evening.

As an aside, the other day on the Larry King Show featuring the memory of Marlyn Monroe, with a few beauties of the 50's and 60's,I could not help but compare them with Diana Rigg who is close to 67. Looking at them and hearing them speak plus a clip showing Monroe gyrating and speaking in her manufactured little girl voice, they paled compared to the charm, dignity and vocal expression of Diana Rigg.  In my opinion she is the epitome of femininity and a grace to the human race.

Finally, if I were to be stranded on a desert island, completely on my own and was offered only one consolation prize, I would choose a DVD player with the complete Emma Peel (Avengers) set.

To those who are not acquainted with the Avengers, I heartily recommend the entire set. I guarantee it will give you hours of

pleasure no matter how many times you view repeats.

1627887,5,B00005MKOL,"One of the most popular partners for John Steed was Mrs. Peel, Diana Rigg.  She really brought the series to life.  When Diana Rigg left the Avengers to pursue far greater roles, the series declined to its' cancellation.  This box set gives all the Emma Peel adventures in uncut digitally remastered state.  This is much better than the old days of broadcast TV.  It is interesting to note, back in the 60-70's, how really hip and modern all this seemed.  Now some of the episode have lost that 'edge' but they still are great fun to watch.  Even my kids like to watch them.

All the episodes are here..some of course are better than others.  From ""Too Many Christmas Trees"" to ""The House that Jack Built""...the Avengers fan can't go wrong. My favorite is 'Dead Man's Treasure' about a road rally with Steed and Emma getting put with different driving partners.",1121990400,,861,4.6490066225165565

Frankly, I can't abide Tara King -- she couldn't drive Emma's car.  What really makes this series so great is Diana Rigg, who must have decided to do this series as a lark, and for the paycheck, since she was and is a serious actress, Royal Shakespeare Company, no less.  When I watched this series as a teenager, I (and many of my friends) all wanted to be Emma Peel.  One of my friends took up fencing, and wore catsuits, and wore her hair in a perfect Emma Peel flip (I couldn't get mine to do that....)  Anyway, the plots are often silly, but the dialogue is always fun, tongue in cheek, and very adult (in an era when comedy was Petticoat Junction, and drama was Peyton Place).

1627891,5,B00005MKOL,"I can still recall the first time I saw Diana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel.  This was a breath of fresh air for female stars of this period.  Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale had opened by eyes, a woman dressed in leather and pants(!) and could hold her own, was intelligent, and did not always need the male to ride to her rescue, WOW!  This was totally missing from the women role models on telly in that era.  Diana Rigg took that foundation and really made it her own, so everyone quickly forgot about the woman who came before Mrs. Peel.  Young girls of today cannot begin to understand what reinforcing role model this was to the ""new image"" of women.  They have no idea how it was frowned upon for women to wear pants.  I recall being in the US at a restaurant in the late 60s and it has a sign up behind the register ""women in pants will not be served""!  Hard to believe, but yes that was the attitude for women's dress of that day.  So Emma was the new wave for the independent woman.  And what a role model!  She was charming, beautiful, but depended upon her mind more than her body.  She dressed in Carnaby street stylish jumpsuits, boots, drove like a demon and fought like a man. The whole time with a twinkle in the eye!  She was gorgeous, but in a very real way, and wow, did I want to be Emma Peel when I grew up!

I have many of these episodes on tape, but to have them in pristine condition on DVD, it's just a thrill.  She and Patrick Macnee, created sparks, though they romance was kept at a distance, and more importantly, they respected each other.  So this was a series that was ahead of it's time and with two classy actors, that took the world - and my heart and imagination - by storm.

I still wanna be Emma Peel!!",1097366400,,1731,4.181268882175226
1627892,5,B00005MKOL,"Are there any words that can adequately express just how downright quirkily good the original Avengers show is? For someone who grew up watching a couple of episodes of the Joanna Lumley NEW AVENGERS and whose most recent brush with the series was the truly terrible 1998 movie, the COMPLETE EMMA PEEL MEGASET is a revelation.

Yes, I had never seen these episodes and (driven by an adoration of Diana Rigg) I went straight for the Megaset, it could have been a disaster but thankfully it wasn't and now holds an honored spot in my DVD collection.

One of my passions is the James Bond movie series as many people here on Amazon know. Of all the leading ladies in the series Diana Rigg is one of the best, and surely the only actress whose beauty and charm could have melted 007's heart enough for the superspy to propose marriage.

However five years before she made her mark on one superspy series as Tracy, Diana Rigg was making her mark on another superspy franchise on the small screen as the daring, intelligent first true kicka** action chick- Mrs. Emma Peel.

I think it's telling that Emma  Peel/Diana Rigg is the only AVENGERS character/star to yet get her own Megaset. At a recent poll held on commanderbond.net she was a runaway landslide winner and it's not hard to see why.

From the opening minutes of the first episode when a man walks out of the sea in a giant ziplock bag you know you are in for a treat.

It is a show that is miles ahead of its time and this is no more apparent than in the initial appearance of the cybernauts (who would return in later episodes (including in THE NEW AVENGERS). Here we have a mad wheelchair bound eccentric scientist who uses robots to eliminate competitors seeking to woo a Japanese tech company. Some of the gadgets and gizmo's demonstrated by the scientist were obviously in the realm of science fiction in 1964, but today they are science fact.

The thing I love most about these shows (apart from Ms. Rigg) is their quirky offbeat plots. Stretching the envelope in a way that no show before (or since) the AVENGERS feature some really unique and original storylines that leave the viewer guessing.

Take the episode THE HOUR THAT NEVER WAS for example. Steed and Emma Peel are on their way to a party to mark the closing of Steed's old World War II airbase. Attempting to avoid hitting a dog Steed swerves and crashes into a tree at 11 a.m. Walking the half mile further to the base they find the place deserted and every clock at 11 a.m. What could have caused this? Where is everyone and just what is happening? The viewer is left to wonder until the closing minutes. Add to that, the mystery only deepens when Steed is regains consciousness later on in his car, once again  at 11 a.m. to find the military place teaming with service people, but no sign of Emma Peel. Classic Avengers and great entertainment.

Digitally remastered and showing it I was hard pressed to spot any signs of aging, even on the black and white episodes that were so clean and crisp that they could have been shot yesterday rather than 40 years ago.

Audio is also first rate, there is a slight imbalance in the opening seconds that may have you reaching for the remote to up the sound a little, but then this is often the case for movies made in 2004. The dialogue is clear and the music as fresh and appealing as it no doubt appeared to audiences tuning in back in 1964.

Only around half of the episodes in this set are in black and white, with the rest in color and I Iove both equally. One previous reviewer complained about some cheap production values on the show, but I noticed only a couple of instances where this was apparent (and they did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the show). In fact I read that review here on Amazon wondering if we were talking about the same DVD set, his views and observations were so far from my own.

There are over 50 episodes spread over 16 discs with the only special feature to speak of being stills galleries for each episode. I also enjoyed some of the trivia that appeared on the keepcase packaging such as the fact that the first episode of the Peel era had to be totally reshot when the producers realized the first actress - Elizabeth Shepherd - was not right for the part. How lucky for us fans of Diana Rigg that they realized their mistake!

Compulsive viewing - I pretty watched AVENGERS nonstop upon receiving the set - this show is everything and more than I expected. The plots, storyline and acting is all first rate. I am sure I will pick up DVDs from the other eras but for now I am in awe of the worlds first action chick, over a decade before Wonder Woman and almost 40 years before ALIAS' Sydney Bristow - Emma  Peel.",1092614400,,4724,4.450231481481482
1627893,5,B00005MKOL,"To understand why this TV series worked so well requires a bit of historical perspective. Britain in the early/mid-1960s was a culture in which long-accepted norms were threatened by powerful social forces. The youth movement was forever redefining attitudes toward authority and government, Britain was birthing a type of music that would soon sweep the world, and, particularly important to The Avengers, the women's rights movement saw many a woman demand more from her future than a lifetime of housewifedom.

When Diana Rigg's character of Emma Peel was first introduced to The Avengers in 1965, the show had already been going for several years. The character of John Steed was well-established as a conservative, stiff upper lipped, tea drinking, bowler hatted, ex-military, prime example of upper crust middle-aged traditional British masculinity. Then along came his new partner Emma Peel: young, irreverent and outspoken, sexually aggressive, dressed in provocative mod fashion AND possessed of four doctorates. Bear in mind, at this time in Britain it was almost unheard of for a woman to be a doctor at all. Not only did Emma Peel defy that convention, she did it times four.

To John Steed, exemplar of the-way-things-are-and-should-be, Emma Peel was the living embodiment of forces threatening to destroy everything he held dear, everything to which he'd devoted his life, his duty, his sacred honor. To Peel, Steed was the sort of hidebound reactionary she'd been fighting against her entire life in order to be the sort of woman, the sort of whole person her sense of individuality demanded. The great thing about the John Steed/Emma Peel Avengers episodes was watching these two very different people, each representing social forces the other had every reason to despise, over time learn to value and respect what the other had to offer, eventually even to love each other. An endless source of debate among Avengers TV fans is whether or not Steed and Peel's relationship ever became sexual or was simply platonic. Whichever opinion you embrace, there can be no doubt the love and respect were there.

The Avengers TV show was profoundly fortunate in its casting of John Steed and Emma Peel. Patrick Macnee perfectly portrayed the somewhat stuffy, exceedingly proper man of action. The heart of a noble knight in a three-piece suit and bowler hat. But as good as Macnee was, Diana Rigg's casting as Emma Peel was the masterstroke. For Emma Peel to accomplish everything she had in life before ever meeting John Steed, she must have been a high-level genius. Fortunately for the show, in real life Diana Rigg has an IQ that looks like a zip code, as well as immense class, polish, sex appeal, a strong will, and the thespic skills of a successful Shakespearean actress. When Diana Rigg played a high-level genius with multiple doctorates it was believable. I can't imagine anyone else who could have portrayed Emma Peel so well.",1091059200,,2946,5.070103092783505
1627894,5,B00005MKOL,"Sorry, but I just had to get that out of the way. Dame Di spent her teen years in my home town of Leeds in the UK. Swoon.
Emma Peel was an incredibly important female role model at a time when blond bimboes were pouting, being dumb and twisting their ankles while being led by the heroes as they fled from the bad guys.
Emma Peel, warrior woman, took on the bad guys, and usually won. Xena: Warrior Princess, played so masterfully by Lucy Lawless - also 5'10"", owes a great deal to Mrs. Peel, who was immortalized by the insanely talented, classically-trained actress, Diana Rigg.
I actually loved the black and white episodes - apart from the stories themselves being intriguing, they have an Art House quality about them.
Likewise, the color episodes, which are of superior quality, are just as magical in their own way. The Avengers, even down to the score by Laurie Johnson and unmistakable indidental music, was just flawless, with Macnee and Rigg beng every bit as magical and compelling a screen couple as Bogie and Bacall.
Absolutely wonderful to have these as a single package. If I recall, the name Emma Peel came from the time when they were trying to develop a female character who would have Man Appeal or M-Appeal... hence Emma Peel.
Whatever the reality, in Diana Rigg's Emma Peel, they succeeded mightily. Possibly the most perfect woman who ever walked the Earth.

1627896,5,B00005MKOL,"The Avengers episodes with Diana Rigg rank up there with The Twilight Zone and Star Trek as being among my all-time favorite programs to ever appear on the small screen. A right touch of mystery and a surprising amount of science fiction were often woven together to create episodes that were conceptually fascinating. For instance, A Surfeit of H2O showed how dry ice could be used to create precipitation, but it also, though in a far-fetched manner, revealed how this instance of meteorological tampering could be practiced for evil purposes of flooding out isolated sections and persons of a particular region. A little insight into botany was also gained from watching Man-Eater of Surrey Green; in this episode, it was pointed out that propionic acid, which is commonly identified as an antifungal for skin treatment and as a mold inhibitor in perfumes, could also be used as an effective herbicidal additive.
Though often characterized by its quirky dialogue, The Avengers, I believe, served an educational purpose. With the aforementioned examples concerning the science fiction, The Avengers covered several different topics, ranging from biology to agriculture to the then-Cold War technological ideas and innovations, many of which are just starting to come to fruition. In its own way, the series showed that knowledge is powerful, and with this exposition, it also affirmed that though the work of one machine could do the work of several ordinary men and women, several of this same kind of machine might not be capable of replacing one extraordinary individual.
As added props for educating us viewers, history lessons were also prevalent. In what is perhaps my favorite episode, which was the tabooed (and banned from U.S. television) A Touch of Brimstone, it was brought up that there was an eighteenth-century English group called the Hellfire Club, an organized mob consisting of those who tried to use intimidating tactics and secret meetings so that their hedonistic personal and political  purposes might be met. Initially, I thought that this tidbit was idealized fiction, since American and European history narrators rarely seem to  associate any factions of western society in the 1700s and 1800s directly with pagan practices and rituals of ancient Rome. As it turns out, such a group did exist but under a different name. Though shocking, it was still not as surprising as the out-of-control behavior displayed by the villains encountered by Steed and Peel (even Steed and Peel, themselves, were on the fringe of getting totally in the mix) or the display of Mrs. Peel in the sexy Queen of Sin outfit.
All in all, the format of the several productions and layouts of these episodes fostered this viewer's desire to learn various subjects. Where many universities can make what is otherwise fascinating to learn seem too dreadful to even deal with, The Avengers does the exact opposite. On a parallel note, for you young baby boomers out there, didn't these shows and the cartoon, Jonny Quest, also do the same thing for you?  Or were you too mesmerized by the appearance of the lovely Diana Rigg? LOL.",1059955200,,3129,5.083657587548638

For the uninitiated:  John Steed and Emma Peel were the coolest, suavest, hippest, sexiest pair of crimefighting secret agents ever to grace T.V.  He was old-school British upper-crust orthodoxy and money, she was the chic young-blood, hip-flip, proto-feminist karate expert in boots, leather pants and miniskirts.  Together, Steed (""top professional"") and Mrs. Peel (""talented amateur"") weekly ""avenged crimes against the people and the state,"" which ranged from evil plots by average Cold War Russian spies to ambitious megalomaniacs to everyday organized killers-for-profit.  Their foes included makers of murdering robots, terrorists manufacturing atom bombs in department stores, clandestine military invaders and/or saboteurs from foreign shores, and even a mind-controlling plant from outer space.  The show was part spoof, part parody, part sci-fi, and a lot of straightforward supersleuthing action/adventure.  It was clever and colorful, smart and fashionable, funny, witty, and even thrilling.
There are very few bad episodes in this entire bunch, and even the worst of them is elevated by the phenomenal chemistry between the two stars, Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, whose witty repartee and general unflappability were always the most genuine magic of the whole series.  The bond between the two's characters is formed of the noblest qualities:  courage, patriotism, moral fortitude, mutual respect and devotion, and the willingness to risk their own lives for each other and the safety of the world at large, if need be.
Sadly, the recent badly-made movie severely damaged the desire of a new generation to see what all the grand fun of the original series was all about; but believe me, it's well worth rediscovering, and every bit as good today as it was when it debuted, almost forty years ago.

1627903,2,B00005MKOL,"I'd never seen The Avengers before buying this set. But being a fan of Patrick McGoohan's ""The Prisoner"" and ""Secret Agent"" series, and knowing of the awesome reputation of The Avengers, I gave it a try. I decided to go for the whole Emma Peel set at once instead of trying the individual volumes first. I regret it now. I watched several episodes, and while they were mildly entertaining, they lack realism, to say the least. This is one of those fake shows where you can obviously spot the stand-in who comes in every few minutes to double for the actors anytime they're required to fall down or get in a fight. They give a top hat and umbrella to a stuntman who looks nothing like Patrick MacNee, film him from behind and we're supposed to be fooled into thinking it's him, I guess. This happened so much that I wondered why the wimpish MacNee even bothered to show up for filming. Also, the painted backdrops used as scenery are so cartoonishly fake that they're laughable. Any time you see an open door or window, you'll see the badly-painted 'outdoor scenery', wobbling on the soundstage as if it's about to fall down. I understand that they probably had a fairly low budget, but most of it is just unexcusably bad. The Prisoner and Secret Agent never looked this phony, probably because McGoohan cared more about realism than cuteness. Another major problem I had was with MacNee. His bland, unoriginal acting style is mediocre at best, and he gives the impression, to me at least, that he would probably have been an unpleasant person in real life. Wrong guy for the part; it is totally unbelievable to me that a beauty like Emma Peel would be interested in an ugly, creepy fop like Steed. How MacNee got the part, I'll never know. I found myself watching the show just to see Diana Rigg, a charming actress who did the best she could with the often poor scripts. There is a subtle charm to some of the episodes, the ones that were well-written like Cybernauts, but too many of them are ludicrously plotted and laughably acted. The shows are all riddled with hero/villain guy clichs: bad guys kick, punch, and shoot at at the heroes, but can do no damage, while the heroes can easily knock a guy out cold with only a fake karate chop to the neck, and they have perfect aim every time when shoooting a gun. I was expecting the Vulcan nerve pinch at any moment. It's *really* phony stuff, unwatchable to me. I could only make it through about 10 of these DVDs, trying to give the show a fair chance, but soon I knew I was done with The Avengers for good. I've sold my set, I gave up on them and won't miss them. I can see why so many people like the show, they like the style it had, the actors, and the occasionally well-written storyline, but those of us who need an acceptable amount of realism in shows we watch should stay away, unless you want to weed through dozens of boring, ridiculous episodes to get to the few classics. I don't demand complete realism at all times, or expensive production values, but Steed being a stud, and fake painted blue skies with fake painted clouds as backdrops...come on. I guess if you accept the pair as infallible superheroes, and the show as nothing but a live-action cartoon, and that's *all* you expect, you might like this show. But personally, I found the tremendous reputation of The Avengers to be unfounded. It's not garbage by any means, but it is mindless fantasy fluff - not usually the material legends are made of.",1017964800,,3475,4.526232114467408

The Black and White episodes aren't perfect quality, but that's the fault of the original source material.  However, the B&W episodes on these DVDs still look better than any broadcast that I've seen.  The color episodes are nearly perfect quality and colors are brilliant.
I can't say that there is one episode that I really dislike in the whole of the Emma Peel run.  Good quality stuff and well worth the price.  This set is a terrific value, as the cost to buy the 8 2-disc sets separately would run about double the cost of this set. Extras are a bit thin, just production stills.  However, there probably isn't a lot of behind the scenes material for these episodes.

Also, Dave Rogers' 'The Complete Avengers' is the definitive guide to the series.

1627905,5,B00005MKOL,"I am to young to fully understand this importance of this show compared to other people, yet this is an amazing box set. The transfer to DVD is great. And the story lines are to me cool. It is easy to see that if you like this show you will have a grasp of England in the 1960's in terms of fashion, style and ect. Also Diana Rigg is not only great for the part but she is beautyfull. She really brings life into some shows and John Steed adds just the right spark to the show to give it that classic quality that a lot of TV shows now a days just does not have. for anyone young or old this is a set to check out. At a ripe 24 i wish i could be a little older to really get the full impact of what the show was about. But for the money it was very much well spent, if you ask me.",1014336000,,780,3.7048192771084336
1627906,5,B00005MKOL,"<The Avengers> The immensely popular ABC series called ""The Avengers"" has long since achieved legendary status since it appeared back in January 1961. Since then there have been 161 episodes, which break into four major sections. We have the early episodes (1-26) with Patrick Macnee as John Steed and Ian Hendry as Dr. Keel. Then the ""Cathy Gail"" series (27-78) with Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale, the man-tossing, leather-covered intellectual who broke new ground for female characters on television. Even more popular was the black and white series (79-104) with Diana Rigg and Emma Peel (read ""M[en] appeal ""), which led not unexpectedly to the color series with Rigg (105-129). Then the final section with Linda Thorson as Tara King (129-- in which she co-starred with Rigg-161).
As of this writing, the early episodes in the Gale series and all of the King series are not yet available. However, A&E has just released all of the Rigg entries, both the black and whites and the color, in a wonderful boxed set called ""The Avengers: the Complete Emma Peel Mega-Set."" And Mega, I suppose, is as good as any adjective to describe the enjoyment value of the contents therein. We have here all the Rigg episodes, including the transition entry in which Tara takes over for Emma, on 16 DVDs, each holding 3 episodes with an occasional 4th as a ""bonus.""
Those who have never seen them before will want, of course, to watch them in order. Others will want to jump to their favorite episodes, which is pretty easy on DVD. You will notice that the black and whites were less studio-bound and the sets in general more realistic. With the first color episode, the series took a strong science fiction bent; and the sets, as the producers admitted, were more a view of England as the Americans would like to think it is.
You will also have a lot of fun spotting stars-to-be. There is Donald Sutherland, Brian Blessed and Charlotte Rampling in ""The Superlative Seven,"" Peter Bowles in ""Dial a Deadly Number"" and ""Escape in Time,"" Geoffrey Palmer in ""A Surfeit of H2O,"" and Christopher Lee in ""Never, Never Say Die."" It was a policy that no actor could appear more than once a season, so Bowles and Lee, for example, would have to wait for the King series to play other characters. In fact, the only characters as such to reappear in the color Rigg series from the black and whites is the bumbling Brodny (Warren Mitchell) who can be found in ""Two's a Crowd"" and ""The See-Through Man"" and the evil assistant (Frederick Jaeger) to the Cybernaut-master.

 And for more fun, see how many actors from ""Are You Being Served?"" you can spot? There are three in all.
The most frequent repeat actor seems to be comedian Roy Kinnear, who also has the honor of being in the very last King episode in the role of Bagpipes Happychap. And then we have rotund Patrick Newell who was murdered in the very first Rigg entry, drugged in a color one, and wound up as Mother in the King series.
But all in all, it is the interplay between Macnee and Rigg that really made this program work. Unlike Cathy Gale, who seemed actively to dislike Steed when she was not merely tolerating him, Mrs. Peel had a genuine fondness for him and was not averse to stirring his tea (anticlockwise, as he preferred it). And as for the question of Peel and Steed being lovers, recall that they are fictional characters and have no life off the screen.
The dialogue was light hearted, and you seldom if ever saw blood after a mere trickle in their third episode. You also never saw a policeman, an element that for some reason the producers thought would be a jarring note. (You figure out why; I cannot.)

 The best episodes? There is no question that ""The House That Jack Built"" leads the pack. This is the one in which Emma finds herself in a house designed to drive her mad and Steed appears only at the start and end. The worst? Possibly ""Silent Dust."" The silliest? That has to be ""Epic."" The most serious? ""Murdersville."" So what if the package costs a small fortune? You could purchase them separately, of course; but think of what you would be missing.",999475200,,4111,4.635116598079561
1627907,5,B00005MKOL,"A Digital Video Disc that is.  Or should I say 16 of them. I had the intention of buying these discs as they came out originally, but am glad I waited for this box set.  This is all 51 episodes of The Avengers that Americans were introduced to.  Of course the Cathy Gale ones (what few times that they have aired in America) are good too but everyone will agree the chemistry between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg is worth it's weight in Platinum.  Now we can watch the real Steed and Mrs. Peel adventures all we want at the pace we want.  Definitely a must buy.  By the way, you'd think ""Dame Diana"" could put a good word with the empire and get Patrick knighted by now :-).  Update: 12/15/08:  If you can find one, the 17th disc of the reissued mega set in 2006 [which features 2 full David Keel (Ian Hendry) episodes plus half of his first episode (unfortunately before he meets Steed), a New Avengers episode that Dame Diana makes a cameo in and some other rare goodies including the American showing openings deleted from the b/w episodes in this set (with chessboard vs the shoot the cork off)] may still be available separately.",996796800,,1135,4.423076923076923

Lost a star for that.  Otherwise a set of good quality DVD's. Half are B&W as was the original series, half are in color (or colour).",1524700800,,275,4.612244897959184

7945668,5,B00005MKOL,"Just arrived going through disks now.
Pros:
* OOPS Almost forgot to mention Price... Very affordable.
*  Lionsgate production. :)  I liked that touch right from the start.
*  16 quality DVD's well packaged
*  Two cases with each DVD individually spindled two per each of the four plastic inserts in each case
*  There is clear episode listing on outer set case and each dvd case
*  Menu structure very straightforward and there is even production stills I'm assuming on all disks from looking at the first two
*  If you fast forward once quickly after your episode starts it will skip the open and get right into your avengers TV show

Cons:
*  You have to wait through the intro before you can make any selections.  The intro however is short and well done.

Okay so there you have my short review of this MegaSet.
Disclosure:  I'm Amazon Prime and paid full price for this Prime item.  No compensation was given for this review.",1522972800,,930,4.530120481927711
