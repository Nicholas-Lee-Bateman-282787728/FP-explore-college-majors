2354798,2,B000A345C6,"I agree with reviewer Jerry Hunt. I love the Fractured Fairy Tales themselves; they were my favorite part of Rocky and Bullwinkle when I was growing up, and that's saying a lot. I put this DVD on my wish list and was thrilled to receive it for Christmas.

The stories are as gloriously crazy as I remembered (though I had not remembered how minimal the animation is). And it's a huge treat to watch one after another of them!

HOWEVER, having to sit through a REQUIRED, LONG commercial at the beginning makes this DVD a huge disappointment to me. I will not (as I was imagining) watch it over and over again. I will watch it maybe twice, and then it's going right into the recycle bin.

If it were not for the introductory commercial which cannot be bypassed or fast-forwarded through, my rating would be five stars rather than two. I am really tempted to give only one because of this design item which makes the DVD pretty much worthless as far as I'm concerned.

Huge disappointment.",1200700800,37,986,4.522471910112359

Pair it with the companion book (Fractured Fairy Tales, A.J. Jacobs) with 25 tales for even more fun. I just purchased this disc from Amazon and have enjoyed rewatching these great shorts from my childhood. I couldn't find a list of the included episodes anywhere before purchasing, so here's the rundown in case you're wondering too! The disk includes these 15 episodes:

* The Brave Little Tailor
* Rumpelstiltskin
* Cinderella
* Snow White
* Sleeping Beauty
* Pinocchio
* Ridinghoods Anonymous
* The Ugly Duckling
* Cinderella Returns

The VERY irritating menu demands that you sit through too horrible trailers for terrible kid's movies before you can get to the main menu.  They won't even fast forward or skip to main menu.  Why would Sony insist on this very Disney-like irritation.  What would Jay Ward think?  This disk is for collector's, not brain-dead children who want to watch ""Frosty the Sequel"".  The disk also has menu problems once you get to the main menu.  I've contacted Sony and hopefully they will fix the problem.",1138924800,169,642,4.87962962962963

It is still a refreshing blend of child humor and sophisticated wit. Jay Ward managed to interlace a children's show with political humor, adult humor and sardonic satire by turning the scripts in so close to the deadline that network censors didn't have time to review them before they aired. Some think Shrek, Toy Story and The Incredibles are new breed of child comedy with adult jokes-they are not.  Pixar's success is simply producing feature length Jay Ward cartoons with higher production values. And as good as Pixar 's flicks are- Jay Ward's are better. Nell is in love with Dudley's horse, Mr. Peabody is a brilliant dog with a little boy as a pet, Boris Badenoff is indeed bad enough and his slinky femme fatale Natasha is the sexiest bad girl on TV in 1961. Fractured Fables  was narrated by the inimitable Hans Conreid. Conreid will be remembered by many as the reoccuring ace aviator Wrong-way Feldman on Gilligan's Island.

2354993,5,B000A345C6,"This series is even funnier than Mr. Peabody and Sherman and the reason is the voice of the great comedy actor, Edward Everett Horton, who
was the narrator. As of of the many excellent actors who played in the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, Mr. Horton had a long history of playing
comedy roles in the movies especially in the 1930s.
To prove my thesis is correct, when you watch Fractured Fairy Tales, turn off the sound for a few minutes, then rewind it and listen to the voice
of Mr. Horton.
I am not sure whether Mr. Horton would be happy to know that most people recognize his voice than his physically acting ability, but I have
a feeling that as long as you enjoyed yourself, he would not mind.",1444867200,,697,4.369230769230769

Take a collection of your favorite childhood fairy tales, twist them around until they're better than the originals, and throw in Edward Everett Horton to narrate them, and you will be hard-pressed to find a better way to pass away a perfect afternoon. It never ceases to amaze me just how good Jay Ward and friends really were. Rocky and Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Boris and Natasha, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, Aesop's Fables, Frostbite Falls, Minnesota, The Way-Back Machine- I'm having a nostalgia attack! If you should ever get the chance to watch this show, or any of the other a fore mentioned CARTOONS, you will not ever be able to watch Sponge Bob, American Dad, Family Guy or anything else of that ilk that passes itself off as the new era of cartoons without realizing just how much a shortage of talent we now have in this genre. It's like comparing ""All In The Family"" against any of the disgusting array of reality shows that proliferate the air waves. Reality shows are popular with networks because they don't have to hire actors, script writers, or experienced camera operators. The only possible reason I can see for their popularity with viewers is that we haven't seen anything that stimulates our brains in so long, we've lost our ability to appreciate well-written satire.

But now since I've grown up to be a person in their 60s (that is: the year 2015 minus the 1950s = 60ish, give or take) I've had great fun reliving the ""Tales"" of the past.
The episodes are still funny, amusing and watchable but life and age has made me realize that every thing about the show is ""BRILLIANT""!
Everything about the show is/was ""BRILLIANT"" and far ahead of its time.
I say ""was"" cause I didn't know what ""BRILLIANT"" meant in the 50s.
But now I know better.
The writing (especially the writing) and the animation and the music are undeniably awesome!
Too bad it was looked on as a ""cartoon series"" way back in the day.
It is definitely more than a ""cartoon"" and people should start re-watching it to see how ahead of it's time it actually was.

I think they get a kick out of seeing the tales they know so well turned on their heads.

They get some of the quirky because they know the fairy tales, but some of the innuendo is lost on them - for now at least!  Funny thing is I heard them playing the other day and talking about ""the contract"" which is a reoccurring theme.  They don't miss much!  Of the 3 I ordered - Tennessee Tuxedo, Peabody & Sherman and Fractured Fairy Tales, I'd have to say this is the favourite at the moment.",1358121600,,535,4.155339805825243

2355374,3,B000A345C6,"I actually downloaded this video for my children.  I remember the whole Bullwinkle series fondly, and I remembered the Fractured Fairy Tales as being clever and funny... BUT on viewing it again, I must say that the Tales don't hold up as well as I would have thought.

My children -- who are currently 9 and 11 yo -- were immediately drawn to the voices and images, however they didn't want to view it again.  Bad sign.

I watched them and my response was 'meh'.  The stories were interesting.  I still liked the narrator and idea of the stories but they were not as clever as I remembered.  The plot twists, weren't that twisty.

THE SKINNY:::
Worth watching.  I loved the trip down memory lane and can't wait to watch some of the old Rocky and Bullwinkle shows.

I'm thinking that for today's TV savvy kids, that the Fractured Tales might be more suitable for younger viewers -- 5 to 9 years perhaps.",1302912000,11,902,4.478527607361963

The collection here includes a great selection of tales read by the wonderful Edward Everett Horton. His wonderful voice overs helped make the show. While kids may enjoy it, I think adults would enjoy them more for the clever jabs at life that are still funny. These cartoons were part of the rare animation that may have been marketed for kids, but was enjoyed more by adults. They don't make them like this anymore. You do have to sit through some annoying kid previews, but the cartoons are worth it! A must have for your collection.",1298073600,,669,4.583333333333333

If memory serves me, it was composed of an episode of a serial featuring the titular heros, an episode of Mr. Peabody or an episode of Fractured Fairy Tales, then another episode of the serial. (For those who discovered R & B in it's incarnation as ""The Bullwinkle Show"" this was, I believe, before the advent of ""Aesop and Son"" or ""Dudley Do-right""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Dudley-Do-Right-Vol-1/dp/B00080ZFZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Dudley Do-Right, Vol. 1</a>.)

Although over 40 years old, this collection of 15 cartoons from the original ""Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Bullwinkle-Friends-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00009PJT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends - The Complete First Season</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Bullwinkle-Friends-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000A2X0KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends - The Complete Third Season</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Bullwinkle-Friends-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B0002ABU5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends - The Complete Second Season</a>show are still a treat.  They possess that delicate balance of wit and silliness that the Jay Ward cartoons were noted for, and along with ""Mr. Peabody's Improbable History""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Mr-Peabody-Sherman-Vol-1/dp/B00080ZFZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Mr. Peabody & Sherman, Vol. 1</a>,  were always one of the spots in the show that I eagerly awaited.

This collection is copyrighted 2005 therefore it is possible given the vagaries of the DVD industry that it will not be available much longer.  Also while it is labeled Volume 1, I strongly doubt that Volume 2 was ever issued.  (It may not have been possible to issue a Volume 2 due to lack of material.  However, given that this is touted as the ""Best of"" one can only assume that there is more in the series that could be released.)

I will end this here as ""I suddenly feel an overwhelming urge for a salad made of Rampian, a variety of European bell flower.  If I can't have it, I will surely die.""",1220572800,9,2498,6.802507836990595
2355386,3,B000A345C6,"These fantastic tales would have been given a five star rating except that all I can say is SHAME ON the distributors who repackaged this collection. How can any marketing guru think that by continually punishing us by forcing us to endure the non related promotional tripe that they attach like a virus in the form of unrelated promos will sell more dvds? Happy? NO. Ready to lynch the people who did this? YES.

I can only assume that these people weren't even born when we first viewed these timeless masterpieces as children and somehow feel threatened by the competition. It's enough to make you hunt down a dvd pirate who could make a copy with just the fractured fairy tales only. That's the only way I can think we will be able to repeatedly watch this dvd minus the opening advertising epics that we certainly didn't pay for.",1215648000,28,834,4.597315436241611
2355387,3,B000A345C6,"The material is great, but I can't recommend this DVD because its programming is so irritating.  The viewer is forced to sit through several tedious previews for some truly unimpressive children's videos.  Attempting to fast forward or skip to the next item is produces the message ""Operation Prohibited By Disc.""  This is unforgivable.",1215302400,177,336,5.30188679245283
2355388,4,B000A345C6,"Say what you will about Jay Ward's cartoons, but it's all been said before. Yes, the animation wasn't the greatest, but to me they were just plain funny. I appreciate them more as an adult than I did as a child because I understand the jokes which makes them funnier. I loved them as a child and I still love them. So go ahead and just laugh, laugh, laugh. You'll feel so much better.",1210377600,3,384,4.202702702702703
2355389,5,B000A345C6,"I remembered Fractured Fairy Tales from my youth and wanted to share them with my kids (age 12 and 10).  They loved them as much as I did (and still do).  There are 15 episodes and of course the trademark openings (Bullwinkle with wings, the gnome and the fairy).  If you want a bit of nostaglia (and some good laughs), it's worth the money.",1206316800,3,341,4.296875
2355390,5,B000A345C6,"I just received this DVD from Amazon and watched it right away.  I don't know what other reviewers are saying about the previews on this disc.  I just fast-forwarded to the menu and skipped the commercials, no problem.  I like that you can choose to play one specific cartoon or select to play all.
The cartoons are just like I remember them, including the intro and ending to each one.  I really enjoyed going back in time with one of the main reasons I watched Rocky & Bullwinkle at all.",1205798400,7,489,4.4
8073637,5,B000A345C6,"I almost threw the DVD out it had some sort of kids advertisement, as if this collection had anything to do with brood. Someone doing the packaging evidently did not view the product. Wait there is more you can not fast forward; you can not go to the main menu; your and not pause. You just can not do anything but turn the sound off on the set and go to the fridge while waiting.

If you are lucking and have a DVD riper and copier you can fix the problem.

Once you finally get to view the disk it is worth your time. The 15 fairy tails are in blocs of five. Finally you get the fairy tale as it was meant to be unabridged and unvarnished.
