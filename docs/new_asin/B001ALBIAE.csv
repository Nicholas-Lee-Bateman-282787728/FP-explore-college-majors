8277935,3,B001ALBIAE,"""Deep Freeze"" begins with an overview of the freezer refrigeration system at the Blue Bunny ice-cream plant that keeps product at -20 degrees F. - so cold that workers are limited to 40 minutes inside at a time and much of the work is performed by automation.  Twenty-six large 50-ton ammonia compressors are used.

Then its on to cryogenics - temperatures of -238 degrees F. or lower.  Liquid nitrogen (-320 degrees) is created by pressurizing the gas to 100 psi, removing water vapor, and the quickly expanding the gas to cool it.  Product costs approximate $1/gallon.

Vacuum Dewar (large thermos bottles) containers are used in a number of cryogenic applications, including keeping a reserve of food seeds in a repository 600 miles N. of mainland Norway in the event of a catastrophe.  The cold temperature is expected to extend the seeds' lives from about 30 to 450 years.

Recycling tires is made easier by first shredding and then freezing them - allowing mechanized hammers to shatter the rubber and then easily remove the rubber from the steel wire using a magnet.  The recycled rubber is used for new roads, playground surfaces, etc.

Very low temperatures also allow creating superconductors that carry 2-5X the amount of current normally allowed.  However, the application shown only involves .25 mile distance and seems more of an experiment than a useful application.

Blasting frozen CO2 (immediately turns to gas) onto fragile objects allows cleaning them without leaving scratches that eg. sandblasting would.

Dry ice has about twice the cooling power of water-based ice.

Liquid oxygen and hydrogen (beach ball-sized volumes reduced to golf-ball size) provide liftoff power for American space rockets.

""Deep Freeze"" closes with a tour of a cryonics facility in Scottsdale, AZ. where those stored (brain = $80,000, entire body = $150,000) hopefully later can be restored to life after medical science makes the requisite advances.  Baseball's Ted Williams is probably the most famous ""resident.""",1223510400,,2014,5.211180124223603
