2163681,4,B00063EDJK,"My kids and their friends all loving watching this dvd. Their ages range from 2 - 12. The first time my oldest son, who is 7, sat through the dvd he was disappointed because he thought it was going to be really funny. After watching it the second time, and many times since then, he has grown to love it and sings the songs randomly in the car with his buddies.",1169164800,,361,4.098591549295775
2163682,4,B00063EDJK,"Not just model RR accidents (real or contrived), this is a good educational video, definitely targeted toward the younger set. Songs, animals, and train wrecks, this one has it all.

Our 3 year-old loves this video, which, I feel, is a healthy alternative to non-reality based shows like Barney and Dora. In other words, it's a touch point to a time when earning a living meant getting your hands dirty without anti-bacterial wipes coming to the rescue, yet is still very relevant to modern culture and values.",1141084800,,510,4.862068965517241

2163686,5,B00063EDJK,A hilarious irreverent comedy.,1479081600,,30,6.75
2163687,1,B00063EDJK,"Don't waste your time with this. Not funny, just stupid and tired. In fact, check it out just to see how right I am.",1478995200,,116,3.875

2163692,5,B00063EDJK,"My son loves this video! He will sit completely enthrall end watching all the trains! The jokes are goofy, but some great train footage!",1390176000,,136,4.708333333333333
2163693,1,B00063EDJK,Mostly a lot of outtakes. Not as funny as I'd hoped it would be. The little commercial we saw for it on one of the other I  love Toy Trains videos showed some cute clips (making us want to buy it) but what you saw in the clips was pretty much the best of it.,1362441600,,258,3.690909090909091
2163694,3,B00063EDJK,"This production is probably a little long and does not live up to its advertised funny bloopers.  It is still a fun DVD for the very young toy train enthusiast and is still enjoyed by them.  However, its a little hard for the adult to get through and tends to ""lose"" the focus of the very young enthusiast due to repeated actions throughout the presentation and the length.",1356739200,,373,4.470588235294118
2163695,5,B00063EDJK,My grandson has been asking for this video for a long time and I finally got it for him.  He loves it and it's really fun to watch!,1354579200,,131,3.6785714285714284

2163697,5,B00063EDJK,"Oh No! has been a favourite of our 7 year old for about two years.  He never tires of it, and neither do his other train fanatic friends.  It is a very simple concept, and it works.  Highly recommended for kids who appreciate the absurd (and trains).",1293494400,,250,4.276595744680851
2163698,5,B00063EDJK,"Child says:

Buster crashing into his shed is so funny.  Every time he crashes, they say ""Oh No!""

There are funny songs that they sing while the trains are going.

I hope I get another movie like this.  I really like this movie.  It's a good one.  I sure wish we could watch it every day.

Mesmerizing, funny, and innocuous -- good clean fun.  It's VERY interesting.",1282089600,2,410,4.714285714285714

2163702,5,B00063EDJK,"My 5 year old requested the OH NO DVD, and he's watched it every day since it arrived. We've owned one of the DVDs in the I Love Toy Trains series for a number of years and his favorite parts were always the ""oh no"" parts and of course fabulous Buster, a train that lovest to silly and foolish and crazy and nuts.
