5731516,5,B00COT74RW,"I used to love this show growing up, and now my kids do, too! I'm really glad they've released this on DVD...I own both volumes 1 & 2. The picture quality is surprisingly good, even on a large TV (55""). Get it while it's available...you won't regret it!",1395532800,,253,4.291666666666667
5731517,5,B00COT74RW,I am so so so happy they finally released on dvd. I love this cartoon and i really don't understand why they don't release complete sets rather then volume sets. Its sad how you have to wait a lifetime to rewatch your childhood cartoons yet some shows might never get released on dvd. i was 15 when i use to watch this on tv after schools or satarday mornings now am almost 30 and i finally get to rewatch on dvd,1390953600,6,412,4.098765432098766
5731518,5,B00COT74RW,Goofy is one of the best Disney characters and I loved Goof Troop and all the other Disney Afternoon shows and hope that Disney will do right by their fans and give all of their shows old and new full releases on dvd.,1369353600,8,217,4.069767441860465
5731519,5,B00COT74RW,"After a disappointing 3-episode DVD release in 2006, Disney has finally given Goof Troop a better DVD release with Volume 1 and 2, available exclusively from Disney Movie Club. Each volume contains 27 episodes spread across 3 discs. The episodes in Volume 2 are:

28. Hallow-Weenies
29. Tub Be or Not Tube Be
30. Major Goof
31. A Goof of the People
32. Goof Under My Roof
33. Everything's Coming Up Goofy
34. Good Neighbor Goof
35. Goodbye Mr. Goofy
36. Lethal Goofin'
37. Frankengoof
38. E=MC Goof
39. Pete's Day at the Races
40. In Goof We Trust
41. And Baby Makes Three
42. The Incredible Bulk
43. Mrs. Spoonerville
44. For Pete's Sake
45. Big City Blues
46. Rally Round the Goof
47. Window Pains
48. Nightmare on Goof Street
49. Where There's a Will, There's a Goof
50. Winter Blunderland
51. Gymnauseum
52. Come Fly With Me
53. As Goof Would Have It
54. Calling All Goofs

Episodes 33 and 34 are actually the original hour-long special that started the series in it's split syndicated format. These episodes probably should have been on Volume 1 as Episodes 1 and 2. The discs are housed in a standard size DVD case and are stacked. The video quality is in line with other animated shows from this era, like Ducktales and Tale Spin. Disney Movie Club charges $19.99 for each volume. I wouldn't recommend paying much more than that outside of the club.

After these 2 volumes, there are still 24 episodes of Goof Troop left to be released, so I'm hoping they will make a Volume 3. There was also a Christmas special that was released several years ago by Disney Movie Club.",1369094400,16,1577,4.526315789473684
5731520,5,B00COT74RW,"I really liked this show. And with episodes where Pete ends up the butt monkey to Goofy's Shenanigans, it's really worth it! My favorite of the set is ""For Pete's Sake,"" where he ends up paranoid over someone trying to kill him, after he ran over his own Swiss Army Hedge Clippers.

We need a Volume 3, even if it would be a Digital-Only release, or at least a DMC Exclusive, and a new Widescreen DVD Print of A Goofy Movie, because the Gold Collection print doesn't do it justice.",1500595200,,481,4.344444444444444

5731522,5,B00COT74RW,As a kid I loved the show. It was always fun to watch even if I saw the same episode over and over again. I got this dvd set when I ordered Disney movie rewards' mystery dvd. I had no idea this was even on dvd so it was a quite a surprise. It has 27 great episodes compiled onto 3 discs. Watching this brings back childhood memories. So worth buying,1496620800,,349,3.9295774647887325

5731525,4,B00COT74RW,"These are all hilariously great. Many thanks for putting them out on DVD.

One complaint I have about it is, why in the world did Disney never include a Disney's Goof Troop: Volume 3, 3-disc set, which could have contained all of the rest of the remaining 25 episodes, including the Christmas special? After how long it's been since these first two sets were released, I wish that such a third volume that contains all the rest of the left-over existing episodes would get released as soon as possible from who released the first two, and with enough demands.",1473465600,,559,4.646464646464646

5731528,4,B00COT74RW,"This appears to be the same release as the collection put on sale in 2013 as it has the same episode list peculiarities (Pilot episode included on Volume 2?). The episodes themselves are of pretty good quality as far as 90's animated television releases go as well. The only real downside to this collection is how the discs are held in the case. This isn't going to be an issue for everyone, but for anyone who is not a fan of the stacked disc in one holder method (like me) may be upset to see their brand new discs come out of the case with minor scratches on them. I've also collected the episode list (as numbered by the episode original air date) below in case the review that does this from the previous release isn't showing up here.
