8626173,5,B00GPWEPQ2,"This was a really wonderful show when seen on TV.  It had enough twists and turns to keep the plot moving, and the characters were fun to watch.  While rooting for Alice and Cyrus to find their way to each other, the characters of Will, the Red Queen, and Jafar constantly changed up the story's path, allowing Wonderland to have a much different story of its own.  It was enjoyable watching from beginning to end, and its one season was enough to provide a complete and satisfying story.  I'm hoping eventually it will be released on a DVD of its own, for those of us who prefer DVD's instead of downloading.",1472947200,6,609,4.45945945945946
8626174,5,B00GPWEPQ2,"I LOVED OUATIW!!! I was disappointed when they cancelled it. It took me a minute to figure out where we were in the Alice timeline, but it was great. I loved that Anastasia was the Queen of Hearts. I wish we could've seen more of Cinderella in OUAT besides the one episode she got. And from what i understand, there are supposed to be 2-3 more episodes before the finale but they cut it short. I wanna know what happened in those missing episodes dagnabit. I can NEVER get enough OUAT.",1470096000,,485,4.34065934065934
8626175,5,B00GPWEPQ2,"This was an excellent stand-alone spin off of Once Upon a Time. It was only intended to be one season. Alice & Cyrus & Will & Anastasia need to come home to my movie shelf!
Naveen Andrews as Jafar is some of the casting crew's best work.  He is deliciously evil.
Please fix this horrible oversight!",1467590400,10,298,4.321428571428571
8626176,4,B00GPWEPQ2,I enjoyed the show until they cancel it.it would have been epic to see a cross over between the two shows once upon a time and wonder land. And the dvd never came out don't be fooled keep asking maybe it will.,1459036800,5,209,4.0
8626177,4,B00GPWEPQ2,"I've watched every season of Once Upon a Time. Was really looking forward to buying and  watching Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, then it never came out! Now it's looking like it will. And I really hope it does.
The only reason it is four stars instead of five is because I have never actually seen the show besides clips and trailers. But when/if I do I am sure I will love this show and it will be five stars. If I remember I will update my review when I see it.",1454889600,11,464,3.989247311827957
