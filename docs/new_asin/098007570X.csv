7800952,5,098007570X,"This is a beautiful and useful tape with real healing powers. The scenery is breathtaking and the subtitles simply plant an idea and then go away so that you can taske the imagery further in your own mind. Excellent music.
  The second half is words only and was less successful for me.",1076630400,,286,4.480769230769231
7800953,5,098007570X,"Dr. Simonton and his team have created one of the most encouraging, empowering tapes (video) that I have found in my wellness journey.  I've listened to dozens of cassette tapes - some of them also by Dr. Simonton - but none equals this in its ability to invite you into a healing, comforting space. It puts illness/wellness into a healthy perspective and helps one see that both can be viewed as part of life. Since buying it I have hardly missed a day watching and relishing its soothing effect.",981763200,4,497,4.584269662921348
7800954,5,098007570X,"This video is calming, soothing, promising and wonderful.  Even better and more effective is Dr. Simmonton's audio cassette called ""Getting Well""... this cassette deserves about 10 stars, as it is so necessary  and effective towards the fight against cancer.  I hope anyone who reads  this will order it for themselves or someone they love who has cancer.  Dr.  Simmonton has the proper ideas on how we will beat this terrible disease.  I wish you well!!",924566400,5,454,4.973333333333334
