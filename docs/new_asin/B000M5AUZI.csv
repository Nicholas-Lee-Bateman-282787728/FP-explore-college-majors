8166416,4,B000M5AUZI,"THIS IS IN CHINESE WITH NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. Also, the cover is plain B&W text. That said, this is a nice routine, ~6 minutes long at a moderately slow pace. The space required is moderate, about 15x15ft area. The instruction is broken into four sections. Li Fa Jun performs the routine with grace and deft fajin, and performs the instructional segments as well; however, the only audio is a separate narration, which I'm pretty sure is not Li Fa Jun. So, the lack of subtitles is not too much of an issue, since it designed mostly as follow-along, not in-depth teaching. There is additional video afterward that looks like a home video of temples and surrounding areas - somewhat odd to be included, but oh well.",1509321600,,714,4.674603174603175
