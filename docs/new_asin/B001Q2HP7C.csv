8334929,5,B001Q2HP7C,"Unclear on what Product Contains!

DVD set only has episodes 1-10, instead of all 26 episodes!  I would recommend buying by volumes it is less expensive then this set.  I got burned badly with this purchased.  I would have been better off going to Best Buy.  Do not spend $149.49 for this collection, because when brought separately the whole series cost only $105.00-$120.00 dollars.

I highly recommend this anime series.  The story line and artistry are of the highest quality.",1263168000,12,480,4.925

(REAL NAME)
The Emperor's younger son has been possessed by a water demon. Social norms demand that the Emperor kill his son, but in order to prevent the public from learning of the disgrace to the honor of the ruling family, he has assassins arrange for a fatal accident. The anime begins when a wandering female bodyguard named Balsa foils yet another ""accident"". The Prince's mother knows what is going on and hires Balsa to protect her son.

The culture is similar to Japan's Heian Era (before the rise of the samurai as a distinct social class) but the two moons in the sky belies that. I have to say in all honesty that this is one of the best anime series that I have ever seen. For me it's as close to perfection as I am ever likely to experience. In fact I was so taken by it that I saw all 26 episodes in only 4 days. I don't think I've ever done that before. (Well, maybe the first time I saw Record of Lodoss War. It was so long ago, I'm not sure.) In terms of character, voice acting (Japanese---as a rule, I don't like dubs), story, action, animation, and BGM it is top-notch. Whether it is the sweep of natural vistas or the pomp and splendor of life at court, the visuals are stunning. It takes the time to develop the characters so that they feel like real people. Chagum, for example, grows from a pampered prince into a young man. One of the things I really like is that the story has no true villains. Even the assassins who are sent out to murder Balsa and her ward are behaving as their society dictates by being loyal to the Emperor. Even the ""bad guys"" have nobility of character. If Hayao Miyazaki were still making TV series, this is what they would be like. It has much in common with Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. As much as I liked that movie, Moribito is better. It is directed by a young guy named Kamiyama Kenji, who also directed GITS-SAC I & II and GITS-SAC: Solid State Society. He's a protg of Oshii Mamoru and a director to be watched.",1252281600,6,2082,4.295165394402035
