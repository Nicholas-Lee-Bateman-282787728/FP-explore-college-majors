3850747,3,B00263ZHX4,It was okay. I wish if she would have given information about proper breathing techniques when lifting. Not bad for a beginner level weight training tape.,1294963200,,154,4.961538461538462

8351795,5,B00263ZHX4,"I purchased The Body Basic Weight Training Workout from a different source.  I had never heard of Gloria Kamil, but was going to give her a chance because the 2-4 minute preview seemed to be effective compared to the library of other workout DVDs that I have.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who desires to change their body and who is committed to achieving his or her physical fitness goals.

Gloria is a no nonsense and get right to the point type of instructor.  She is relatable.  She allows you to see that she worked hard for her chiseled body in a classy way, which is inspirational.

I look forward to my workouts with her.  I wish she had a website and a library of workouts that I could use in rotation.

I am seeing AWESOME results thanks to Gloria sharing her workout methods.",1496534400,,796,4.404109589041096
8351796,4,B00263ZHX4,This is a good basic video. It had adequate demonstrations of various exercises.,1461801600,,80,5.230769230769231
8351797,5,B00263ZHX4,This video is excellent.  You truly feel it working.  Wish she'd come out with another one.,1458518400,,91,4.625

8351799,4,B00263ZHX4,I have yet to do the tape but I think it will be very  beneficial.,1456012800,,66,3.4
8351800,5,B00263ZHX4,I don't remember where I bought this video or how long I've had it stacked with all my other unused workouts.  I got it out a couple months ago just to see what I was missing and man I'm glad I did.  It's true there are a lot of squats and the lower body segment is long longer than the rest but being pear shaped that is just fine with me.  I love that its not a bunch of chatty chatty nonsense she just gets right to the workout.  I could tell a difference in my whole body within  2 weeks.  I wish she had more videos.,1428105600,5,521,3.822429906542056
8351801,5,B00263ZHX4,"I have noticed results after the second sessions. Of course, I can't do the entire workout session yet, But I have obtained positive results in my lower body.",1392336000,2,158,4.678571428571429
8351802,5,B00263ZHX4,"This lady is clearly educated in this field. Mor importantly she knows how to educate you, I definetly recommend this purchase to anyone that is trying to lose a few pounds and/or get in shape.",1347408000,3,193,4.542857142857143
8351803,3,B00263ZHX4,"This video is good for a person with good legs looking to get great legs.  She spends close to 40 minutes on legs. If your legs are weak or you're not used to doing a lot of leg work or squats, you'll have a hard time walking in the morning after doing this video. I lost count of how many squats are in this video, but there are a LOT...A WHOLE LOT...regular squats (with calf lifts), plie squats, butt squats and probably some other squats I missed. I'm also not sure why there are so many squats and no lunges or dead-lifts in this video.

There was also way too much ""stand-up-lay-back-down"" going on for my taste.  When I'm on the floor, I want to do EVERYTHING I need to do that requires me to be on the floor and be done--abs, chest and of course, more legs--none of this ""stand-up-lay-back-down"" stuff.

I felt she rushed through the upper body--probably because she spent so much time on the lower body.  She completely left out shoulder work and did two back, two chest, two bicep and two tricep exercises one of which I thought was considered a chest exercise--the push up.

Lastly, personally I feel a good video has a cool down section in addition to the workout--even if you elect not to use it.  A lot of people probably don't know how to really stretch it out after working with weights and that's missing from this video.

PROS:  She gets to it, no fluff, inner and outer thigh work
CONS:  Too much lower body work, no shoulder work and no cool down or stretching section

As dated as it is, I still think ""Weights I (and Weights II) The Ultimate Body Sculpting Workout"" by Francesca Fisher is the best overall video if you want a well rounded workout with weights.  She'll superset you to death, but it's' worth it!!",1331596800,17,1734,4.401253918495298
8351804,4,B00263ZHX4,"I ordered this DVD as I was looking for a TRUE weight training video, not a dancy one. She delivers straight weight training in this one for your full body. Her delivery is a bit boring but the workout is good! She looks fabulous so I was motivated to do it!",1300492800,3,258,4.078431372549019
