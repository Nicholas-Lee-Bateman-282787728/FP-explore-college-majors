8739259,4,B017HMM45W,"Voices from the Grave is a new horror anthology that if you are a fan of Creepshow, Twilight Zone or V/H/S you may want to seek out. The title of the film comes from a novel that as the film opens we see this guy read this novel in stories. The first story is entitled All Hallows Eve. This story really captured the fun of old school horror about a man who feels so responsible for the death of his brother. As you can tell by the title this has something to do with that October 31st day and yes it does because this guy is just so down in the dumps over the death he is not in the spirit for Halloween. Well, he gets a visitor who may change his life.

The shocker to this short is that it really was so effective in its feel and tone. This short will make you really want to turn a light on while you watch. As good as the first of the three was, it was number two that I will sing the praises all the night of that being Invitation. When I named Twilight Zone earlier this was why, this feels like something that was lifted from the original show. Have you ever gone to a party and everyone seems to know who you are but you have no clue exactly who anyone is? That is what happens in Invitation. Two men go drinking in a bar, the business man who is visiting leaves and when he gets to his car, there is a note inviting him to a party signed with one letter, W. We learn as the story goes on that it is not a W, but an M. I want to go more in depth but I will end this by saying, whatever price you have to pay for this dvd, Invitation alone is worth every dime.

Story three is called Re-Possessed. I will say this was the weakest of the three for the sole fact that the first two stories had fun and an odd way of giving us fear, this story just seemed to exist just to exist. Cheapskate tells his girlfriend he wants a car, the car costs a whopping 700.00 he buys it, later on finds out that the car belonged to the guys dead brother. Guess who has come back to claim his car? The Christine references to the film were ok, but this short from the acting to just how hokey it felt just was such a fail. Now that being this short may appeal to others, if people are new to horror they may appreciate this more than someone who has seen the majority of films. As a whole I loved the bulk of this film and would really recommend the first two stories the most and maybe the last.",1455580800,,2384,3.954261954261954
8739260,5,B017HMM45W,Saw it in Tempe AZ at the theater premier showing great indie budget film. Purchasing my copy right now reminded me of the tales from the crypt film. Loved it !!!,1455321600,2,162,4.258064516129032
8739261,5,B017HMM45W,"I had a chance to see this in a Theater prior to it's DVD release and it is a terrific Halloween Horror anthology, It features a story from Howling author & Horror Icon Gary Brandner. I would Definitely recommend this to Horror & Anthology lovers. Three tales of the supernatural, well written with a Twilight zone feel you don't wanna pass this one up.",1446422400,3,353,4.53125
