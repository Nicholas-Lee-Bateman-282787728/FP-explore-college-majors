I do not get bored watching these! They are simply phenomenal. I recommend them without any qualifications!",1455753600,,284,5.195652173913044

8666930,5,B00LNID1GI,"I purchased the entire 10 episode series and I absolutely love all ten. I ordered another copy of the first two episodes to send to one of my sons.
All ten are excellent but the first two are particularly poignant because they are about who Jesus is (1), and (2) His teachings. Father Barron's presentation is wonderful. He has become one of my heroes in the Catholic faith. The on location filming adds extra meaning to what Fr. Barron says. It's almost like taking an actual tour of the areas where Jesus lived and taught and where the early Church began.
As I said in an earlier review, it's a faith builder for Catholics and very informative for anyone wanting to know more about Christianity.",1421712000,,697,4.584
8666931,4,B00LNID1GI,This is a fine production.  I have listened to only about thirty minutes of the first disk.  I have the entire five disk set.  The photography is excellent.  My only negative thing I have to say about it is the quite loud background music.  It sometimes drowns out the commentary.  So far it is interesting historically regarding the clash with empirial Rome.  Jesus as God is a challenge to Ceasar who considers himself to be god.,1421020800,,431,4.592105263157895
