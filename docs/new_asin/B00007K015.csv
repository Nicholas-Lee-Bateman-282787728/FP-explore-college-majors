Well..... mabye the cheesecake.

What this is a a terribly funny, deliberatley camp little series.

Tomy (the people responsible for the losely connected series of plot holes known as Zoids chaotic century) put together a plot to promote some toys, which was then assembled into 90 minutes of silliness by people responsible for the slayers, bubblegum crisis, excell saga and lodos wars.

IF you want some of ""great director nabeshin""'s earlier work, you cant go past this insane, inane little gem.

If you want something worth devoting some actual time and brainpower to however, you've come to the wrong people.

Worth wtching in dub simply for the strangly cute accients of the robot AI's.

Well worth fishing out of your local anime stores' any old junk, $8 a tape bin.",1138665600,,902,4.933774834437086
7977123,1,B00007K015,"Battle Skipper is a three episode mini-series about
school girls from two different clubs wage war by
using mechs called Battle skippers. One club called
the Etiquette Club, has five girls in its membership
whom happen to be ditzy and shallow. The Etiquette
Club are the the forces of good that try to save
the world from: the rival club called the Debutante
Club. The Debutante want to rule the world, though
it is never explained how they planned to do it, they
just say ""some day we will rule the world"". I'm pretty
sure that this anime was meant to appeal to girls
since it contains a magical-transformation sequence,
but there are better girl shows out there, (ie...sailor moon).
So whom is Battle skipper going to appeal to?
The answer: no one

The artwork is dated but looks average, the animation
quality is also average and the action is forgettable.
The english voice-acting is as terrible as can be. The
battleskipper mechs are weird looking, stumpy mechs,
which actually don't look like mechs at all. In the final
battle there is a spaceship shaped like a rose/flower and
then it was revealed that the battles was just a ""game"".
Why waste your time and money watching anime like this when
you could be watching something else. Contains three
episodes ends on episode three and never makes a comeback.
Okay for teens.",1134172800,2,1328,4.724137931034483
7977124,1,B00007K015,"It's hard sometimes to describe what exactly it is that makes a show lousy. Is it mediocre dialog? Lackluster action sequences? Lifeless and uninteresting characters? So-so animation? Or how about a incredibly unoriginal clique-ridden (slapped together)plot that puts you to sleep? In other words, this anime is just plain bad, and there's nothing really to redeem it from that status. No compelling characters, no cool designs, no great music, nothing. Save your money and skip this one. There's better stuff out there.",1096243200,5,520,5.353658536585366
7977125,4,B00007K015,"Set in the not-to-distant-future, Battle Skipper is a 3-episode OVA series(despite the fact its labeled as a ""movie"")that deals with the five members of the Etiquette Club in one of Japan's most prestigious schools are secretly a group of crimefighting mecha pilots called the Ex-Stars. Their main competition is the school's other club, the Debutante Club. Their leader is planning on taking over the world with her own army of mechas. So, the Ex-Stars try to foil their plans, while still keeping a decent grade average! This series was based on a Japanese toy line, but became its own unique and dynamic action comedy series. For fans of Project A-Ko or Sailor Moon, Battle Skipper is a hilarious anime with lots of great gags and a wonderful sense of fun!",1074297600,4,759,4.846153846153846
