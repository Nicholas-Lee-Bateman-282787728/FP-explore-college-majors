8424354,3,B004CZZZTU,"David Hemmings is highly effective in ""Fragment of Fear,"" a film that drags you around the whole way without you knowing what's really going on. The film acts like a paranoia thriller, much like one of Alan Pakula's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/trilogy-of-paranoia/dp/B000HZI0HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">trilogy of paranoia</a>&nbsp;or Kafka's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trial/dp/B00K5M2DDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trial</a>, and you stand up for Hemmings and the unreal things that seem to be happening to him all the way through. Then the end comes and you find out the real story.

Hemmings is an Englishman engaged to be married who seems to think someone's following him, breaking into his flat, making off with his stuff, etc. He makes a very good case for this to the police and just about everyone else that will listen, but they all seem to turn against him right when he needs them to work for him. Even his fiance seems to have doubts about some of his stories.

Shot on a slim budget, most of the action takes place in an around Hemmings' London apartment, a dingy place you wouldn't want to live in. I don't recall where I lived in 1970 but I'm fairly certain it was better than his cramped little place. But I wasn't living in London either.

There isn't a lot of action, plot or character development in this little film that has only a handful of scenes, most in the apartment.

I think this movie is worth a turn on your video player or download system if you are interested in this sort of thing. It tends to keep you guessing until the end -- unless you are more astute than I was or a better guesser at what's going on.

If you like this film or are intrigued by it, check out Robert Altman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Images/dp/B00009Y3NA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Images""</a>&nbsp;for a more subtly nuanced view of a woman with similar problems.",1409011200,,2025,5.540453074433657
8424355,4,B004CZZZTU,"I first saw this film on television in the 1980s, and was on the edge of my seat.  This is, perhaps, a must see for all fans of David Hemmings, who delivers a totally believable perfomance as a former drug addict turned successful author.  The plot involves the mysterious murder of the young author's aunt, plus an intricate web of blackmail, and the possible involvement of prominant political officials.  The real mystery is exactly what the murdered woman was involved in, and with whom, since the murder is never solved.  Furthermore, the possible political nature of the affair is made even more suspenseful by several attempts to drive the former drug addict insane, which are carrried out by someone who mysteriously knows everything about him.  In the end, the viewer is left to decide exactly what did or did not happen, since there are no concrete answers, but only subtle implications.  This is a brilliant and underappreciated suspense thriller that I highly recommend.",1306195200,7,982,4.993865030674846
8424356,3,B004CZZZTU,"""Fragment of Fear"" from 1970 stars David Hemmings the same year after he did ""The Walking Stick"" with Samantha Eggar and was directed by Richard C. Sarafian, the director who did ""Vanishing Point"" and then ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing.""  He is the same author who worked on Warren Beatty's ""Bugsy"" and ""Bulworth.""  ""Fragment of Fear"" is beautiful to watch, but as the disclaimer says, ""Go ahead and tell the ending, if you can fit all the pieces together!"" it is fragmented to the point of frustration and does not seem to let up and with the film being available now through Columbia Classics, one can watch it over and over to get all the clues.  The writing by Oscar winner Paul Dehn and cinematography by Oscar winner Oswald Morris are standouts.  Hemmings was a new kind of hero.  But it all depends on that missing cohesiveness that one wonders if it is really there.",1299801600,5,875,4.583333333333333
8424357,5,B004CZZZTU,"Another golden nugget from perhaps one of the best years in film, 1970. Fragement of fear is right dead center in a time when films looked wonderfull, natural lighting abounds in this film along with a soundtrack that is as important as the rest of the parts.  Hollywood take note...you lost your way, now you need to find the path back to the vocabulary, look and forward thinking of 60/70's. It's long past due.  Hat's off to director Richard C. Sarafian!!",1265587200,11,458,4.6419753086419755
