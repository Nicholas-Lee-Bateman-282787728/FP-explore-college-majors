4852096,5,B005ODD1UY,"If you've ever enjoyed a Masterpiece Classic like Upstairs Downstairs you might want to give this gem of a series a try.  The Jewel in the Palace is a wonderful story with some unforgettable people, sets, costumes and locations.  It is easy to see why this series was so popular it has even inspired a theme park, you really become immersed in 16th century Korea and life from peasants to the palace.  If you have any interest in cooking you'll particularly love the scenes in the palace kitchens.  You'll hate the villains and love the heroine and her hero.  There is even some martial art action from time to time, some comic relief and lots of nail biting tension.

Be warned, it is addictive!  At 54 episodes you'll find that at half way through it you are saying, I can't go to bed till I see what happens next.",1333238400,20,816,4.436241610738255

4852099,5,B005ODD1UY,One of the best Korean drama ever made.  Excellent subtitles for the Poh Kim (PK) version. Great value for 80 bucks considering there are 54 episodes.,1430870400,,150,4.769230769230769
4852100,5,B005ODD1UY,"Great Story, Great Plot! But 2nd half has very Poor English Subtitles!  translated from Korean into Chinese than a Chinese person  translated the Chinese subtitles into poor English that doesn't make any Sense.  In Asian Languages (Chinese, Korean and Japanese) they say things backwards. Instead of I'm going to the store. They say ""Me Store Go"". So the English subtitles are all backwards.

Great story! Jewel In the Palace is arguably the first successful historical feminist drama, retelling Jang Geum's rice-to-riches story during the Chosun Dynasty 500 years ago. Jewel is the real story of Jang Geum, (Starring Lee Young-ae) a young girl who is the first woman to become the King's supreme royal physician in a male-dominated society. Behind her child-like eyes lies an ambitious working girl with a 21st century mindset. See how Jang Geum goes from being a virtually abandoned child to maid, to cook and than finally becoming the King's doctor. Which is unheard of as it was a male dominated profession at the time. This unforgettable drama of epic proportions tells the touching and tear-jerking story of a true underdog.
Great Plot!  ""Jewel in the Palace"" is based on a True Story about a legendary girl (Jang-Geum) who after much struggle and heartbreak became the first woman of the Chosun Dynasty to be the supreme royal physician.  In a time when women held little influence in society, young apprentice cook Jang-geum strives to learn the secrets of Korean cooking and medicine in order to cure the King of his various ailments.

10th highest rated Korean drama of all time. Produced for US$15 million, it was later exported to 91 countries and has earned US$103.4 million worldwide, becoming known as one of the primary proponents of the Korean Wave by heightening the popularity of Korean Pop Culture abroad.

4852103,5,B005ODD1UY,"About 500 years ago during the time of Chosun Dynasty, Korea boasted a rigidly hierarchical and male dominated social structure. Set in this period, ""Jewel in the Palace"" is based on a true story about a legendary girl named Jang-Geum who became the first woman to be the supreme royal physician of her times.
Despite her poor condition as a low class girl in the male dominated society, Jang-Geum overcame a series of social discrimination and landed herself as a royal cook, later becoming the royal physician, then ultimately the physician in charge of the king.
She was even given by the king the title ""The Great Jang-Geum"".

4852105,5,B005ODD1UY,"this is a brilliant series about a young girl who enters the palace as a kitchen maid and ends up something else entirely.when i received this boxset i quailed at the sight of 14 dvds,but as i started to watch it, i was immediately hooked.the first episode looks a bit ropey and it's a little slow but it picks up as soon as jang geum get into the palace.the politics and backstabbing,as the cui family try to keep their monopoly of trade to the palace and the way jang defeats them by sticking to her principles no matter what happens to her makes this show addictive viewing.even my 10 yr old nephew liked it! the one fault i have is the bad subtitles.mostly they were ok,but every now and then they turned into gibberish or the wrong words were used.mind you they were quite funny.all in all, a good watch!",1420675200,,809,4.4

4852109,3,B005ODD1UY,"I bought this series from a Malaysian seller at eBay, but it may be of a different version. It is on blu-ray discs and consists of 2 separate boxes with red covers showing only one Jang Geum's picture on the front cover. All are good and beautiful until it reaches episode 33 when suddenly the translation seems to be changed by a machine. All the persons' names and titles have been translated into ""long now"" (= Jang Geum), ""adjust together"", ""remaining is not"", ""end now"", ""the"", ""resist the building of tallest temple"", ""adult"" (= sir),  etc and all in small letters to make it even harder to understand. And then all the sentences are gibberish words in English. For examples:
1) Ask your belly.
2) You stare the why I see.
3) You are how can here?
4) You arrive how can here come?
5) Not yes.
6) Helping you likes bulge.
7) If he gives the cent unjust, perhaps can also manages the dirt.
8) These problemses will exsists still off.
9) Is (= yes).
10) Is a (= yes).
I can say 99% of the sentences are like the above. Initially my family and I are laughing, but after a while it is so painful to watch it. I am now up to episode 36 and it is still like that. I have never seen a movie with such an extremely terrible translation.

I write it here because it seems there is no option for me to write a review at eBay.",1412553600,11,1320,4.192913385826771
4852110,4,B005ODD1UY,"The beautiful drama series with the subtitles with Chinese Korean English. It should be made directly from Korean to English.

I am into historical mini-series.  Empress Ki is the best Korean series I have seen so far.  The King and I is another pretty good one.  Other series I like:  Hornblower, Elizabeth I (2005), Noble House, The Tudors and North and South.",1407456000,,412,4.575342465753424

4852114,5,B005ODD1UY,"In my opinion, this is the greatest Korean drama ever. Although I haven't seen every single Korean drama (it is impossible), I have seen quite a few in my lifetime. This drama, in my view, is the best of the very best.

What makes this drama special? It is about so many things we hold dear that includes love between child and parents, love between teacher and student, love of food and medicine, and love of truth and honor. Most of all, this drama is about redemption.  In my view, to live a meaningful life, one must choose to live a difficult one. Dae Jang Geum displays that in the most masterful and compelling fashion.

The acting is special. It isn't just Lee Young Ae (Jang Geum), but I felt Kyun Mi Ri (Lady Choi) who plays the antagonist gave the best performance of her career. In drama such as this, the antagonist must be as formidable as the protagonist and I felt the antagonist's performance was just superb.

The writing is second to none. The writers, in my opinion, were very experienced and understood the nuances of power and politics. For example, despite all her special talents and superhuman perseverance and determination, Jang Geum couldn't achieve success alone. One of her special and critical abilities were her ability to develop relationships with the right teachers and sponsors. If you want to understand politics and power, then this drama should be seen just for that reason alone.

This drama has been an international hit. It isn't quite as well known in the US and Europe, but it is practically a household name in virtually every other continent.

I recommend this drama especially for children. It has no sex or violence. Yet, it teaches some of the most valuable lessons in life one could learn vicariously, even for adults.

Pros:
1)Superb storyline that is compelling. It is about overcoming all obstacles in life by turning crisis into opportunities. It is about love and redemption. To live a meaningful life, one must choose to live a difficult one.
2)Superb acting. This drama has some of the best acting Korea has to offer. Many actresses were at the peak of their abilities when this drama was shot.
3)Unforgettable characters. I just will never forget them.
4)Hits on all cylinders except sex and violence (there is none).
5)Great for children.
6)Superb portrayal of the nature of politics and power.

Cons:
1)Takes about 5 episodes to get going.
2)Goes little overboard in terms of number of persecutions Jang Geum has to face.
3)Last 4 episodes drags on the series little too long.",1402358400,,2536,4.787185354691076

4852116,5,B005ODD1UY,"We loved this series so much, we wanted to own it. Many of these historical Korean dramas are so exciting, it is hard to not want to watch them late into the night, just to get to a part you feel you can finally wait for and still get good sleep! The acting is amazing and the subtitles are okay, although we do notice some grammatical and incorrect word usage at times.

4852119,5,B005ODD1UY,"I used to have this series before, but gave it to my grandson.  It was an inspiration to him, as he was going on the wrong path.  As I told him there is no excuse for people to do the wrong things because of what happened to them as children, because we are in control of our lives and we have choices to make..  I had him see this series and he changed his ways. Thnaks so much for making it affordable so I could get it again",1377993600,,427,3.8295454545454546
4852120,3,B005ODD1UY,"Story line and the actors were brilliant, but the quality of ALL the action (fighting) scenes were blurry. Quite disappointing. Had these were recorded skill fully it would have worth the money.",1376870400,10,194,5.09375
4852121,4,B005ODD1UY,"The content first.
The story is interesting, Knowing that it is based on a real person makes me wonder how it really was back then. Seeing Korea and learning a bit of it's culture is good to. I am watching it with my Korean girl friend who loves it. For me the style is a little simplistic but it is still watchable.
The content is probably worth 3.5 stars ***** I have just finished watching the series now.  I have increased my overall rating to 4 stars. I will now say that the story is worth 4.5 stars.  I stand by my earlier comments, however I think that the story (and possibly the acting or I have gotten more used to the style)grow as the series proceeds. I really like shows that have a long story arc and this show has one that goes from start to finish. It has some very poignant moments.
Next this edition
The outer case is fine, but the discs are just in CD type soft slip covers (very cheap and as soon as I saw this I was worried that this might be poor quaility).
Fortunately the video does seem to be fine, however the production of the discs has been skimped on in a few annoying ways.
A) there are no episode lists on each disc, just chapters.  This makes it very annoying if you are returning to a disc part way through (there seems to be 4 chapters per episode).
B) Poor quality subtitles. The translations are poor (maybe barely acceptable), the length of time they are on screen is ridiculously short most of the time and occasionally way to long and there are frequent miss spellings.  This detracts from the whole experience quite noticably.  With good subtitles, when you think back on the program the next day it should feel like the characters were speaking your language, but these subtitles make it feel like the characters were mute.
C)The volume (especially of the disc production credits)is set very high compared to all other titles.  Be prepared to get blasted as you start it.
This edition is probably worth 2.5 stars.

In summary, because of the poor production of the discs it takes quite an effort to watch, so make sure that you are ready to concentrate. However with practice it does get easier to deal with the bad subtitles. I can now say that I think the effort is worth it if you cannot get a better edition.
Hope this helps",1376784000,13,2270,4.390476190476191
4852122,2,B005ODD1UY,"The quality of the picture was just about perfect- not the issue.
But, my main issue and why I returned this boxed set is that the English subtitles are NOT good.
I watched the first series from Netflix but it only went up to Episode 16.
The English subtitles were great.
They made sense & you were given enough time to read the lines.
I wish I had read the reviews on this one as other customers said the translation was from Chinese not Korean and it was awful- and it was.

4852124,5,B005ODD1UY,"This is a great and dramatic movie to remember. This movie is worth buying because of its foods, arts, actors, and backgrounds. I also enjoyed the fighting. The actors seem like they are really in the moment. This series inspired me to study more about the Korean Language. It didn't only inspire me to study about the history of Korea (like how it became a country, how they came up with their write system, and how Korea was divided into North Korea and South Korea) but also how started, and it how it was craved and worked on as time went on (and one of the things they have improved on dramatically as time passed is their food, man it is good!).
The series is about an orphan, Dae Jang Geum, which lost her parents when she was the age of 6. Before the mother died, she set goals for her daughter, but the main goal was to become the Highest Court Lady. The orphan sets off to an adventure to fulfill her goal and on the way, she learn some very important life lessons. It is a movie that tells about life in Korea in the 16th century and how anyone can change history forever.
This series is one of the most addictive series I have ever watched before. This is a have-to-watch kind of movie and it is seriously worth it.",1366934400,,1227,4.2703862660944205

It looks like a 4th generation knock off, blurry, pixelated, and menus that do not work reliably. If you watch this series online, you'll see what it should look like.

I had to play the final episode and then consult Wikipedia, DramaWiki, and AsianWiki to forensically confirm that I had received a complete series. To make matters even more confusing, the DVD I received lists the final episode as #70, whereas it would appear that there were only 54 official episodes. Because of this discrepancy, I had to fast forward through the ""final"" episode to see whether the last scene on my DVD matched the descriptions on the various Wiki sites I consulted. Furthermore, it is fairly evident that the DVDs I received are copies made from other copies. The quality is low definition such that it appears is if everyone is wearing some kind of plastic mask.
