921217,3,6304773366,"High school science nerd Scott Baio develops telekinetic powers after mixing marijuana and plant food.  He and buddy Willie Aames scheme to use it while gambling, playing baseball, and opening blouses...not necessarily in that order.  Actually pretty funny (those who don't care for this sort of thing might want to pass) with a great supporting cast:  Stuffy Robert Mandan as the principal, Sue Ann Langdon as a horny teacher, Heather Thomas as the snotty blonde bombshell, and Scatman Crothers is hilarious as the custodian.  Baio's parents are particularly funny.  Mindless fun for the ""Porky's"" and ""Ridgemont High"" crowd.",1013126400,4,626,5.346938775510204
921218,4,6304773366,"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).
NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!  Speaking of, there are at least 2 terrific songs on the soundtrack, ""Got to believe in Magic"", ""King and Queen of Hearts"", etc.  Worth the price alone.",1012348800,47,1312,4.468354430379747
921219,5,6304773366,"Let me start this review by saying that I am a little biased.  I LOVE Scott Baio!  I have Chachi boxer shorts, a Charles in Charge poster above my bed, and I celebrate his birthday every year (Sep. 22).  Now let me tell you that Zapped is the best movie about a high schooler with special powers (as if being Scott Baio isn't power enough!) I have ever seen!  Baio and Willie Aames have splendid chemistry.  These talented stars are alomost at the level of C. Thomas Howell and Peter Horton!  You should really do yourself a favor and buy the movie that started it all for this spectacular pair.  The one thing that will be Zapped! is your funnybone!  Sensational!",982195200,,664,4.429752066115703
921220,3,6304773366,"A very interesting movie...funny at parts with strong supporting performances from Felice Schatcher (who played Nancy on the Facts of Life's first season) and buxom Heather Thomas (who looks too OLD and well  developed to be a high schooler). Scott Baio developed telekinetic powers  and mainly to use it for personal gains. The ending of the film borrowed  heavily from the film Carrie...but with a twist of course! Clothes started  coming off everyone in the prom with interesting results. Watching the  final scenes you get the impression that teenage girls DO NOT wear bras and  that guys wear red bikini briefs with the Rolling Stone's lips logo on the  crotch.
A funny film nonetheless and is not supposed to be based on  reality (GOD FORBID!)",957916800,4,749,4.936
921221,1,6304773366,"There is pain.  There is anguish.  And then, there is ZAPPED!.
The nicest thing that can be said about this picture is that all 10 fans of ""Charles in Charge"" can gather in one room and thrill to the  first onscreen pairing of Scott Baio and Willie Ames.  Baio plays Barney  Springboro (and with a name like that, you know it's nerd time, despite the  actor's then-irrefutable teen idol status), a brilliant high school student  who, thanks to a rather convoluted and ridiculous chain of events (see  below), falls prey to a chemical explosion in his lab, and awakes with  telekinesis, which we all know is the ability to burst open and then tear  off entirely the clothing of nearby actresses (not to mention Heather  Thomas' stand-in).
Now, even to a comic book fan like me, the  circumstances leading up to Barney's accident are mind-staggeringly stupid.  As near as I can tell, mixing Jack Daniels, and then beer, with a  rapid-growth plant fertilizer will a) result in a violent explosion that b)  will endow any mammal nearby with the power of mind over matter.  One can  almost hear the film's producers saying through chomped cigar stubs,  ""Who cares HOW he gets the powers -- just get to the naked  girls!""  I mean, come on, folks -- booze plus fertilizer = Uri  Geller??
Believe it or not, things go downhill from there.  Willie Ames,  looking only seven or eight years too old for his role, is the ""bad  influence"" on the personality void that is Barney, convincing him to  ""use his powers"" (heh) to win baseball games and fights with  bullies and roulette exhibitions.  The gorgeous but unfortunately-named  Felice Schachter (late of ""The Facts of Life"" and, as far as I  can tell, nothing else) is the nerdy, nosy, brainy, bespectacled student  reporter who wants the scoop on the transformed Barney...and if you think  she has any chance of avoiding her fate as The Girlfriend/Conscience/Raison  D'Etre (TM), then this is clearly your first movie.
There are several  references to other films at work throughout the picture that must have  been intended as humorous, but are in fact too lame to even be called  ""spoofs.""  Fortunately, STAR TREK, THE EXORCIST, MAGIC, and of  course CARRIE -- whose prom night sequence seems to have inspired the very  creation of ZAPPED!, thus cursing forever the houses of Stephen King and  Brian DePalma -- are made of stern enough stuff to withstand the ravages of  ZAPPED!.
Throw in some incredibly cheesy early-80's puppy-love tunes, an  inexplicable sub-plot about the principal's affair with one of his  teachers, and the late, great Scatman Crothers' marijuana-induced vision of  Einstein, Ben-Hur, and salami -- must be seen to be believed, I swear --  and you've got yourself a perfectly vile, steaming hunk of celluloid that  no true aficionado of bad film should be caught dead without.  Me, I keep  ZAPPED! on the shelf between SUPER FUZZ and GLEN OR GLENDA... neither of  which have exclamation points at the end, but probably should.",918432000,12,2995,4.860834990059642

Then we have  Bernadette who spies on the boys and finds what has happened. This is the typical type of movie for the time, harmless enough but with the occasional lady parts shots to keep the teen boys involved while the teen girls at the time got to swoon over Scott and Willie.

921425,3,6304773366,"Olive Films have done a wonderful restoration job on ZAPPED even though the movie isn't above average the transfer is terrific. Scott Baio plays a high school lab geek who gains powers of telekinesis when an experiment goes awry.

In 1982, Baio was king of the teen magazines and had a huge following so its no surprise he was given the lead in this alongside Willie Aames (EIGHT IS ENOUGH). The chemistry is so good between the two they were paired a few years later in the CBS/Syndicated sitcom CHARLES IN CHARGE. In fact, this whole movie kind of feels like a feature-length sitcom what with its goofy subplots about horny teachers (Sue Ann Langdon is a hoot), and ineffectual, buffoonish parents performing exorcisms as well as the cast made up of faces familiar to anyone who watched TV in the 70s or early 80s. Heather Thomas (THE FALL GUY), Robert Mandan (SOAP), Scatman Crothers, LaWanda Page (SANFORD & SON) are all here as is Felice Schachter who was one of the original girls on Season 1 of THE FACTS OF LIFE. Schacters FACTS character, Nancy, was one of the fast girls on that show, so its fun to see her playing a more reserved, almost nerdy girl here. And the guy who played Blairs boyfriend in the FACTS pilot also appears as Heather Thomas college boyfriend.

Since younger teens were the primary audience for this, the nudity and coarse language is kept to a minimum and like I said, its a cross between CARRIE and an 80s sex comedy, right down to the chaotic prom sequence at the end.

Fun to view at least once for nostalgia, but no lost classic. THREE STARS.",1466294400,,1578,4.549295774647887

921427,5,6304773366,"I grew up watching this movie on TV so often that I have every line memorized and really can't be objective about how it holds up.  It's a sweet, corny teen flick that could have qualified as a movie-of-the-week if not for the occasional flash of nudity.  But what I can be objective about is the quality of the blu-ray... and I'm utterly blown away by the clarity.  The opening credits end with a scene at a school pep rally, and you can clearly the see details of faces in the crowd.  Shots with overlaid credits/FX don't fare quite as well - but they're still a significant upgrade over MGM's old DVD.  Not much has been done to improve the audio, which is probably a good thing - it's accurate for the movie/time, and too often they screw things up with 5.1 remixes.  The chapter stops also leave much to be desired, as huge chunks of the movie are lumped together in 8 chapters.  As is standard for Olive Films' releases, there's not an extra to be found anywhere on the disc, which is thoroughly disappointing given the movie's cult status.  However, despite the lack of extras, if you're a fan it's worth upgrading because you'll see details you've never seen before in this remarkable HD transfer.",1465430400,2,1205,4.52073732718894

921463,5,6304773366,"Zapped has always been one of my favorite movies from the 80s.  One of the reasons I love Blu-ray so much is because it can give movies new life and Zapped is a perfect example.

I had the DVD since release and it was never ""wow"" in terms of PQ.  The Blu-ray is an incredible step upward.  Given the age of the movie, it is never going to look like it was made yesterday, but I was really impressed by the over picture quality.  The picture is anamorphic so it fills the full screen.  I did not notice any picture artifacts, dust, scratches, pops, etc.  This is a very clean print although a bit on the soft side.  The only problem I noticed was a scene where the camera switched between Barny and Bernadette where Barny looks a bit yellowish.  It was distracting, but thankfully a short scene.  There is a minor grain field which does not distract and never intrudes on the viewing experience.  If you are a fan of Zapped, this is a must have upgrade in terms of PQ, but please don't pay Amazon's ridiculous $30 price for it, especially since the pre-order price was only $13.99.

I can't really provide an adequate review of the Audio as I watched it on my 2.1 system.  It is not a very sound effect heavy movie, but I did have to turn up the volume kind of high, however I am using small speakers on that setup.  Dialog was clear and sounds effects and music did not overpower.",1464220800,5,1380,4.277992277992278

This is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time right next to ""The Karate Kid"" movies starring Ralph Macchio & Pat Morita! For those who've never seen or heard of ""Zapped!"", it's about a teenager named Barney Springboro (Scott Baio, ""Happy Days"", ""Charles In Charge"") who's trying to get his research done for a science project that deals with rats. One day, an accident happens and something explodes in Barney's face which gives him telekinetic powers. He uses them to move things, make things come to life, and to defend himself from bullies. His friend, Peyton (Willie Aames, ""8 is enough"", ""Charles In Charge"") wants to make money off of him, his girlfriend, Bernadette (Felice Schachter, ""The Facts Of Life"", ""30 Years Of Life"") wants him to become famous, his parents (Roger Bowen, ""MASH"", ""What About Bob?"", & Mews Small, ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Sleeper"") thinks he's possessed by a demon. When he goes the prom, crazy stuff happens! This movie makes fun of movires like ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Carrie"". This movie became a cult classic at the box office! IMDB gave it a 4.7 out of 10, I give a 9.4 out of 10 which is higher then ""The Godfather"" which people call it the movie with the highest rating on IMDB. Ever sence I saw this movie, Scott Baio & Willie Aames was became one of my favorite actors of all time!

Welcome to ZAPPED!, a classic example of teen sex comedies from the 1980s such as PORKY'S, PRIVATE RESORT, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, PRIVATE SCHOOL, etc. combining awkward adolescent romance with a breast obsession that is somehow both leering and innocent. There's not much plot to speak of: Barney (one-time teen heartthrob Scott Baio) uses his powers to win a baseball game, get back at his oppressive parents (who try to have him exorcised), and help his best pal Peyton (Willie Aames, Eight is Enough) get laid with the aforementioned busty cheerleader (buxom blonde Heather Thomas, The Fall Guy).

Along the way there are peculiar fantasy sequences about Star Trek and Einstein, as well as a strangely drawn-out subplot about the school principal (Robert Mandan, Soap) placing a personal ad. ZAPPED is sprinkled with nudity and four-letter words, but what's even more striking is how the budding relationship between Barney and would-be reporter Bernadette (Felice Schachter, The Facts of Life) feels genuine and sincere--far moreso than the plastic, prefabricated romance of contemporary teen comedy. In fact, up until the berserk prom sequence when Barney goes into a weird, horndog-CARRIE frenzy of telekinetic clothing removal, ZAPPED is surprisingly sweet and will provide a dose of warm nostalgia for guys who grew up watching these movies.

This comedy flick takes me back to memory lane to when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1982 when I was 9 going on 10 years old in the 4th grade when we had all those budget cuts going on, due to the recession we had in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was president.",1387411200,,1856,5.098684210526316
922375,4,6304773366,"Sure ""Zapped"" has never been seen as high art, or high caliber filmmaking, but for those looking for an 80's comedy that's never boring with a likeable cast, then this one is for you!
Scott Baio stars in this one as a science nerd who gets the power of telekinesis after work in the school lab goes horribly wrong. What will he do with his new power? And will him and his fellow nerdy classmate get together and stay together by the end credits?
That about sums up the plot, and it is a silly one. That being said, it never tries to be more than it is, and it ends up being a whole lot more fun then it really should be.
The cast here is quite good! I found it a bit hard to believe that 80's Scott Baio was the nerd who couldn't score a date, but that's the movies for you! He carries the film very well, and is very likeable in the lead role. Everyone else is also quite solid, and Scatman Crothers is particulary fun in a supporting role as the school baseball coach.
The film's rated R, and it does contain some nudity.

""Zapped"" may not be the funniest film ever made, but it sure is entertaining, and that is what really matters here. It may sound cliche, but they truly don't make them like this anymore.

The underdog nerd scientist who, after an accident in the lab has the power to move things with his eyes! Telekinesis! Every underdogs dream! I used to long for that power. With a mother & father that supresses him Barney finds himself with his new look on life. He takes the losing baseball team to the top and gets himself off the subs bench and astounds everyone with his fierce, powerful batting. All with a little help of course. The bullies get the comeuppance and humiliation they deserve. Throughout the whole story Barney is dealt with lessons in what's right and wrong. He even falls in love with student council president Bernadette! Only three people know about Barneys gift, himself, Bernadette and his best friend, rich kid, sex maniac Peyton. Peyton has ideas that gambling is the road Barney should go down with his power after a very successful winning streak on the roulette table. Controlling the ball Barney and Peyton send the rich popular jocks in a spin as they win every game and lots of money. Barneys conscience is tugged throughout the whole film by Bernadette who fears he's selling out in doing what Peyton makes him. Love concours all in a heart warming finale. The senior prom is a prom to remember a bit like Carrie. But Barney does not kill everyone he wants to teach a lesson he uses his powers to strip the whole year of their clothes and causes chaos! All leading to the dramatic ending. All this set against the beautiful soundtrack of David Pomeranz power ballads ""Got to Believe in Magic"" and ""King and Queen of Hearts"". Zapped is a cross between Grease and Carrie! A real light hearted cheesy comedy you can't help but smile at! So pleased it finally made it to DVD!",1300492800,6,1854,4.553892215568863

I LOVE IT!

When forced by friends in late night gab fests what movie they'll never admit to anyone they love, ZAPPED! almost always tops the list (with Spielberg's ""1941"" a close second) - I'm talking about myself and close friends my age.

It's hard to predict whether this movie will have lasting impact on future generations - I mean, the clothes, feathered hairstyles and make-up of the early 80's are dreadful (i.e. Aames's Jordache jeans), but for anyone in the mood for a good d*** and fart joke (not to mention a belching dog), I highly recommend.

I grew up in the early days of cable tv and ZAPPED! aired a lot back then, almost as often as THE BEASTMASTER. Since then, it's been like an enigma - like a bad relationship you know will never work, yet you can't walk away from and try to hide from everyone at all costs.

the plot

Barney Springboro is the high school geeky sort who spends most of his school and after-school hours in the science lab. When his best friend Peyton Nichols saw an opportunity to take advantage of the fact that Barney had the run of this room at school, he hid some marijuana plants behind the principal's prized blooms in order to sell the stuff and make a fortune. While Barney was studying and doing experiments, Peyton would show up from time to time and check on Barney and his secret plants. One time, while Barney was studying with mice and their motor skills while intoxicated, Peyton poured some of his beer in the test tube Barney was working with. This new concoction somehow gave one mouse telekinetic powers, and when the test tube accidentally smashed on the floor, the vapors Barney inhaled gave him this power as well.

Another student, Bernadette, who is with the school paper, finds out Barney's secret as well as Peyton. While Peyton nudges Barney into cheating at sports, having the upper hand at gambling, and securing him dates with the hotter opposite sex, Bernadette wants Barney to use his power for the scientific good. Barney tends to go along with Peyton, as his ideas are somewhat more fun.

Barney and Bernadette seem to grow closer as a couple until she becomes fed up with Barney's willingness to comply with Peyton's devious requests. Will this permanently tear apart this new relationship? Will Barney end up in jail when he's found out? Find out when you watch Zapped!

the breakdown

After watching Zapped! so many years after when I first used to enjoy this flick in the mid 80s, I've come to the conclusion that I must have been so obsessed with nude breasts on the screen. These things alone have earned Zapped! a five star rating from me for a long time. Finally, I viewed this movie after not seeing it for at least a decade I was quite let down. I thought this was very funny in my own twisted memories, watching it today I don't remember even letting loose a snicker from under my breath. It also could be the signs of the times and how things have changed. Back in the early 80s, promiscuous sex was virtually risk free, drug use was just a victimless crime, and women were merely objects of desire. These days casual sex is like playing Russian roulette, drug use is frowned upon by society, and women...well maybe that hasn't changed too much except that more men have dropped their standard that objects must belong to the opposite sex. This signs of the times' argument may have some validity now that I think about it. Someone must have thought that Scott Baio and Willie Aames have made a great comedic duo as they were teamed up for a successful TV show Charles in Charge. Then again, they both could have just had pretty good agents working for them back then.

In any case, it doesn't matter because Zapped! sucks today in 2011. Scott Baio and Willie Aames were OK with what they had to work with. They keep your interest as telekinesis in the hands of a high school student is always interesting, but as this is labeled as a sex-comedy, this doesn't really keep up with its end of the comedy bargain. Actually as far as the sex goes, it feels kind of tame especially for the era. The big draw for topless chicks here would be Heather Thomas, but the one time we witness her without her top on, we get a body double. Felice Schachter, that sexy brunette from the first season of the TV show -The Facts of Life, plays Bernadette, Scott Baio's love interest. As most leading ladies from the 80s sex-comedy heyday are excused from participating in the topless frenzy.

What we get instead of a true 80s sex-comedy is a limp noodle with no laughs. The closest this film gets to funny is when Scott Baio has to freak out his mother with his Charlie McCarthy dummy in order to get out of his house. They didn't approve of Barney spending all of his time in a science lab, yet they were OK with his bad influence best friend. Just another example of how parents are clueless I suppose. This was just an almost boring basic collection of 1980s stereotypes as far as a high school movie should have. We have the hottest chick who dates a college jock, the nerd who gets all the chicks, drugs, stupid adults (principal, school faculty, parents), and chicks that always seem surprised they're naked. I'm not sure if this film was intentionally spoofing Stephen King's classic horror film Carrie, but especially with the whole prom scene toward the end it feels quite blatant that the writers were out of ideas. Oh yeah, one more clich, and one of my most hated, is the said jock getting thrown into the prom table with the punch bowl. Really? Pass this one up. I'll give it two stars.
