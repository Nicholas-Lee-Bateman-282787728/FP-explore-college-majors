8546909,5,B00A6GCJ5C,"I saw this on PBS near Memorial Day -- outstandingly well done and recommended viewing for everyone.  I support PBS but $17 is high for a documentary you will probably watch once -- at this price this purchase makes more sense for schools, libraries or veterans groups who will get multiple uses.  Individuals should first try to search out viewing on PBS (request rebroadcast by your local PBS station) or streaming when available, IMO.",1436400000,,437,4.891891891891892

8546912,4,B00A6GCJ5C,"This is the best documentary covering the American home front during World War II, but that's mostly because it's the only one that I'm aware of.

I teach the novel ""A Separate Peace"" in my high school English classroom. The novel essentially takes place during 1942 against the backdrop of the war. Before I begin the novel, I try to give my students a sense of the impact the war had on the civilian population. I have been using portions of the Ken Burns documentary ""The War,"" but barely twenty minutes of that actually covers the home front.

Steven Schlecter's 1985 documentary ""The Homefront"" covers some aspects of civilian life that Burns' excellent film does not, but at only 85 minutes Schlechter spends too much time focused on the battle front:  the conflict in Northern Africa, concentration camps in Germany, D-Day, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan.  Certainly these are events to be covered in any film of WWII, but as the dvd back cover states:  ""'The Homefront' is the story of the American people during WWII:  how they lived, what they thought, and how they were forever changed."" Schlecter too often loses sight of this goal.

There are, however,  two areas that this documentary covers in significant detail:

1. The emergence of the woman in the work force. For the first time in modern America, women became an integral part of the work force. The role of women was forever changed. (Although following the war, most women returned their the more traditional role of housewife.) This changing role of women was not without its downside. Children had increased unsupervised time after coming home from school. Juvenile delinquency was on the rise as well as the drop out rate. In addition, the year following the end of the war saw the highest divorce rate (up to that time) in our nation's history.

2. Racial tensions were also exacerbated on two fronts. Distrust of Japanese-Americans led to the internment of  more than 100,000 citizens for much of the war. In addition, prejudice against blacks kept them out of most of the better paying jobs. (I was especially taken by one newsreel clip that showed a protester with a sign that read ""Let Hitler win--he hates Negroes, too."")

But for every aspect of the home front that is covered in detail, many are given short shrift. These topics include rationing, scrap metal drives, war bonds, the USO, Civil Defense. For example, most civilians were limited to three gallons of gas per week, no driver could own more than five tires, and the national speed limit was 35 mph. However, you don't learn that from this documentary.

Through the use of stock photos, newsreel footage, radio broadcasts and present-day (1985) interviews; Schlecter tells a fascinating story, and there is plenty of information and first-person accounts presented. Unfortunately, some of the coverage is too brief to make this definitive. RECOMMENDED",1386979200,,2905,4.92827868852459
8546913,1,B00A6GCJ5C,This DVD is horrible. Don't buy it. Poorly written. Badly acted. Not worth your time unless you like that sort of thing.,1380067200,3,120,4.5
8546914,5,B00A6GCJ5C,"I have been using this film in my US history classes for 22 years.  While other films became dated or better ones were made, this one has stood the test of time. It is relevant, accessible, funny, tragic, and real. It covers the changes caused by the watershed events of WWII--for teens, women, Integration, internment, men, child care, disabilities, economics, etc., as well as highlights of the war theaters.",1379635200,,410,4.942028985507246
8546915,5,B00A6GCJ5C,"I've been teaching history at the college-level for fifteen years and I'm always looking for documentaries that that offer complexity without boring students to death.  If a teacher design the perfect documentary, it would educate but also enthrall students by drawing them into the drama of the historical moment.  The Homefront does this in spades--it somehow walks this very nuanced line between evoking pride in one's country for the remarkable wartime efforts of ordinary people on the homefront while at the same time excavating the underside of the wartime experience--the internment of Japanese Americans, race riots and discrimination, juvenile delinquency and latch-key kids, the social pressure placed on women to marry GIs, etc....  It does this all with wonderful interviews with ordinary people, amazing footage, and a classic soundtrack.  Using personal stories, it highlights the way that the war transformed individual people's lives on the homefront, but also shows the larger national shifts taking place, as America would emerge from the war an economic powerhouse, but also a society that was more urban, more industrial, more corporate, and more impersonal than existed before.  It underscores also the vast social changes for women and minorities that would occur in the wake of war.  Great, great, great movie.  Students love it.  So will everyone else.",1372291200,,1377,5.431924882629108
