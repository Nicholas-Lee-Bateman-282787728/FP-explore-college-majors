8294828,5,B0014CKCFG,"I'd never seen or even heard of this show before, but it looked like fun so I took the plunge and bought the set. This is great escapist entertainment. The setting is stunning (and, ok, so are the women!) and it's just a really great fun action show. A special mention has to go to the hilarious Fabio pose in the opening credits , boy does that man fancy himself!",1254614400,,364,4.214285714285714
8294829,5,B0014CKCFG,"Acapulco H.E.A.T. is a series based in a tropical paradise setting located in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. It's about a group of people that would go undercover on a mission in Mexico, the Caribbean and South America combating injustices and international terrorists. The cast included: Catherine Oxenberg, Alison Armitage, Brendan Kelly, Michael Worth and others. Also, appearances from Fabio. I purchased seasons 1 & 2, the complete series, and enjoyed them.",1247270400,2,456,5.5285714285714285
8294830,5,B0014CKCFG,"When Acapulco H.E.A.T. debuted originally it was at a time when a lot of fluff and eye-candy was very popular. With the array of sexy ladies on display, this show looked like one more bit of fluffy fun for the guys who liked to look at shapely babes in bikinis. For the ladies in the viewing audience, there were an equally impressive selction of sexy young studs, including romance cover model Fabio. However, if you watched the show, you soon discovered it was cleverly written, well-acted, and always a lot of fun. Not to be taken too seriously, it was nonetheless a pleasant and sometimes very effective drama. The theme song is catchy in the extreme and lingers in the memory. So, if you're in the market for something smart, sexy, and yes, a bit fluffy - you can't go wrong with this wonderful packaged set of the two series that were made of the show!!",1214006400,12,859,4.512820512820513
