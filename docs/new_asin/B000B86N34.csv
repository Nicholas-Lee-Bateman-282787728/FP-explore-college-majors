8324981,4,B000B86N34,I don't get this movie at all. It has some music and video of kids playing around. The parts I find the most boring are super fun for my kids. I don't get it but they LOVE it. They like to mimic the things the kids are doing in the movie and get excited when I put it on. Kids love it. I think its weird but I can't deny its appeal.,1299542400,,332,3.625
