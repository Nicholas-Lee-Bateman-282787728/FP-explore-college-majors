If you don't already have the set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-Whisperer-With-Cesar-Millan-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000EGDALQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog Whisperer With Cesar Millan - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;then this is great--otherwise, it's redundant. IMO, you can buy the entire season for about $30, and it is VERY worth the money for any dog owner.",1200441600,55,567,6.888888888888889
2517542,5,B000EGDAM0,"I do not have a dog nor want one,  but I have been sent Cesar's videos here in France and I feel that the fellow is amazing.  Not only does he love and have a deep respect and way with dogs, he also has an uncanny ability to help people to be the best they can be.  Watch how he observes the owners, empowers them to ""act as if"" they were the pack leader and you can see the spring in their step as they realize how easy and rewarding it is to be in tune with nature and themselves. He has a true calling as a ""social"" worker not only in his service to dogs but to all of us.  Bravo Cesar.",1199232000,9,589,3.7642276422764227
2517543,5,B000EGDAM0,I highly recommend this dvd and any other caesar millan series to all dog lovers and anyone who wants to expand their mind. Its dog psychology and human psychology. Its awesome!! Highly recommended!!!,1198972800,4,200,5.090909090909091

2517545,5,B000EGDAM0,What talent this man has.  I have watched these videos over and over.,1178409600,9,69,4.3076923076923075
2517546,5,B000EGDAM0,"Let me start by saying that since reading Cesar's book and watching his DVDs, I've changed the way I interact with my two high energy dogs and we are all much happier and much healthier thanks to the rollerblade sessions and rules and limitations I have implimented. He doesn't claim to be a genious who came up with some wonderful idea, he is simply translating dog psychology into words we can understand as humans.

Some will say Cesar uses fear and pain in his methods. These are the ones who have never read his book and have never made an effort to understand his methods.  If they had made an effort to understand, they would know that he uses energy (posture, state of mind, eye contact etc.) to help dogs understand that he is in charge and that they are to follow his lead and they don't have to worry about decision making in a strange human world.  Simple as that...no pain, no fear.  He uses physical contact only when absolutly necessary and never to the point of injury.  A dog is probably much more likely to hurt itself by pulling on its leash ahead of its owner than by the quick corrections Cesar makes.  I've never heard a dog under Cesar's control yelp in pain and my dogs have never communicated pain or fear.

It is true that the view of a strict hierarchy in wolf packs has been dismissed; however, there is still leadership in packs. It's not a democracy. They don't vote on where to go or what to hunt.  The strongest and most assertive wolves make the call.  ALL CESAR IS TRYING TO GET ACROSS IS THAT WE, AS HUMANS IN A HUMAN WORLD, MUST CONVEY, THROUGH ENERGY, THAT WE WILL MAKE THE CALLS.

Everyone is entitled to choose their own way of teaching their dogs, but putting down another point of view is childish and a sign of ignorance.  For those of you who think Cesar's technique should never be used in any situation, I invite you to come on over and I'll hand you a pitbull trained to fight and you can click at that dog with your little clickers and hollar commands 'till your heart's content. I'll have an ambulance standing by.",1170979200,21,2062,4.41424802110818
2517547,5,B000EGDAM0,"When i read these lying reviewers that accuse Cesar of being mean to dogs, scaring dogs, mistreating dogs all I can think is, ""hmmmm their crappy dog training book isn't selling, they're jealouse and they used their friend's amazon id to slam the greatest gift God ever gave to Dogs.""

There are monsters in the world. Some are big monsters, who start wars for profit. There are little monsters who steal candy from children. Then there are the medium sized monsters who out of jealousy cause people who need Cesar's help to turn away at the sight of a monster's lying review.

I doubt if God sends everyone to hell for lying, but this kind of lie, that does this kind of damage, preventing dogs and their owners from getting help they truly need - oh yeah, you betcha they're gonna burn.",1167955200,14,788,4.542253521126761
2517548,5,B000EGDAM0,"Cesar's approach of using calm assertiveness is gentle and effective.  If you are using pain or fear to force your dog to behave how you want, then you are doing it wrong.  He uses no tension on the leash unless doing a quick touch or leash movement to redirect the dog's focus - not at all to bring pain.  He meets the dogs on their level and helps to 'train' humans on dog psychology, correcting the idea that all dogs are little humans.  They aren't, and approaching them using dog psychology works, gently and effectively.  Our dog is a lucky recipient of this training method, and he is not only happier, but healthier from the new routine Cesar has outlined for us in this video and in his show on National Geographic Channel - The Dog Whisperer.",1161388800,39,752,4.45985401459854

2517560,5,B000EGDAM0,As always Ceasar is a great trainer and always gas the greatest training practices he trains the owner and rehabilitated the dog. You will love how ge works. Great video I would recommend this DVD,1330560000,,196,4.628571428571429
2517561,1,B000EGDAM0,"For those ""Dog Whisperer"" enthusiasts who have watched Season One -- well worth watching -- this is a disappointment, in that it simply recapitulates several of the cases presented in the first season. In other words:  If you've seen Season One, you've already seen, ""Cesar's Toughest Cases"".  You remember the Chihuahua that Cesar ""took to the mat"" (so to speak)?  That's right in here.  Remember the Great Dane that was afraid of slippery surfaces?  That's in here as well.  And so it is with the rest of  this DVD.  There is, however, a salvation which may peak your interest:  The show's Out-Takes.  And that is well-worth watching.

Included is a surprise and unheralded,  ""Bonus Materials DVD"", which demonstrates the show's ""back story"", generally referred to as, ""Out-Takes"".  You will see how the ""Great Dane episode"" was made, finding yourself amazed by the number of people involved in the making of one episode, and how extensive is the preparation for that single show.  Throughout, you'll be reminded that --  although a ""reality show"" -- minute attention  is afforded  to lighting, to microphone placement with its attendant ""sound checks"",  to logistics, to location and to catering.  Moreover,  the show's  ""blocking"",  meaning: every single movement)/gesture, must be designed and rehearsed.  ""Walk-throughs"",  rehearsals and then ""takes"", are numerous before they are accepted as being worthy of the show's standards.  Only through this minute attention to detail, can the viewer's very necessary ""suspension of disbelief"" come into play during the actual viewing of each episode; for, truly, there are 40-50 talented crew members who attend and contribute to the filming and distribution of the, ""Dog Whisperer.""  Post-production time is acknowledged only by implication in that you will be amazed at the miles of  ""footage""  that are left on the editing floor.  Given this, you will be surprised by how ""succinct"" each episode becomes following the editing process.  Keen scrutiny follows before completed release of the episode.

Throughout this entire back story, you will come to appreciate the role played by the show's and Millan's staff -- talented, all --  as well as their dedication to excellence.  For that  reason alone, you might want to purchase this DVD; for the ""Outtakes Segment"" is new material, and it is  truly interesting and certainly entertaining.

 Otherwise?  Although a ""Dog Whisperer"" aficionado myself, my advice?  Unless intrigued by the ""back story"" of the ""Dog Whisperer"" -- as was I --  I advise that you not waste your money on this particular DVD, for you have already seen a good majority of it.

I appreciate your time!",1320019200,6,2675,5.17096018735363

2517563,5,B000EGDAM0,"Like anything that comes from Cesar Millan, this is a great dvd!

2517565,5,B000EGDAM0,"Cesar Millan is truly the ""Dog Whisperer.""  If everyone did what this man says there would be fewer dogs destroyed because of their unacceptable behavior. Cesar is an amazing observer of dog behavior and knows how to save a difficult dog from the local shelter. I have every one of his DVDs.  If you cannot socialize your dog with other dogs; if you cannot take a walk with your dog without getting a tension headache, then Cesar's DVDs are for you!",1255219200,4,449,4.530864197530864
2517566,1,B000EGDAM0,"I sat in astonishment throughout the viewing of this DVD. It reminded me of cowboys in the late 1800s breaking wild mustangs. I have been involved with dogs for 25 years, am a student of dog psychology and have observed many different trainers and their techniques over the years. What I saw was a man putting dogs under incredible amounts of stress to the point where they had to give up fighting for their lives. His customers who were awed as his results must not be aware of such professionals as Victoria Stilwell or Martin Ruetter in the German-speaking countries. I prefer working WITH my dogs and having them enjoy working with me. Pinning a dog to the ground with a death grip and taking being bitten for granted only demonstrated to me how primitive his methods are. Sad.",1252972800,,781,4.625899280575539

2517569,3,B000EGDAM0,"Cesar is always great - he has a lot of wisdom and a gentle way of sharing it.  I enjoyed the tape, but don't know if they were his absolute ""toughest cases"" having seen his first two seasons.  I also bought his third season (but it is a Christmas gift for my husband so I haven't seen it yet).  I think buying the full season sets is a great way to go as there is so many variety of problems addressed.  But if you can't afford a season I, II, or III, this short disc is worth seeing at least to get started.",1223251200,7,509,3.912621359223301
2517570,5,B000EGDAM0,"This DVD is definitely one that every Dog Whisperer Fan and beginner is going to want in their ""Tool Kit""-DVD collection!  Seeing Cesar's
calm, assertive energy at work with the dogs most would run from, is just more positive proof of how ""Cesar's Way"" can change lives!  It's another way for dog owners to see problem dogs in action and see just how effective Cesar's Way is. We of course can't do what Cesar does with the Worse Cases, but we can learn so much about our body language and our dogs body language just from our DVDs of Dog Whisperer. I highly recommend this one, no regrets for adding it to my growning collection. (Can we ever have enough of Cesar Millan-Dog Whisperer tools that have improved our relationship with our dog(s)? No!)",1222992000,4,749,4.582089552238806
2517571,5,B000EGDAM0,"Sorry guys, I'm writing from Germany, so my English is not that good. What I had seen was really exciting, fresh and new and helped me to understand my dog (Mr. Schroeder, one eyed, handycapped Pug-Mix) much better.  Now I am working harder to help this little dog to feel more safe (with other dogs / meeting dogs when he is on the leash etc.)- means: I am sweating and Mr. Schroeder is having a nice time.
Hopefully Cesar Millan will come over to Germany soon to show his work. It just started here, that some people discuss his methods.
The cases are shown on this video are really frightening. I never saw a person doing this things with aggressive dogs. And kids - don't try to do it at home with your neighbours puppy! Ouuch!",1218240000,3,731,4.375
2517572,5,B000EGDAM0,I found this DVD to be absolutley brilliant. I work with problem dogs in a animal shelter in New Zealand so am always keen to learn new ways to deal with unwanted behavior. Cesar's a fantastic teacher! His love and kindness for dogs shines through for me as a student but most of all the dogs.,1217635200,12,293,4.25
2517573,5,B000EGDAM0,"Any of the Dog Whisperer DVDs are excellent!  He covers so many of the quirks that we just normally accept in dogs.

2517575,5,B000EGDAM0,"Admittedly, I didn't think that I needed the Dog Whisperer. I only started watching the show because my niece wanted me to watch it with her. Anyway, our family dog is a 9 year old pug who would get really excited at the worst possible times. He would wake up our baby by barking at the door or for food. He also would run under our feet when we would go into the kitchen or try to feed him. When he was a puppy, my husband accidentally knocked him down some stairs because the dog ran under his feet.

Since I've watched Cesar's show, I've understand that our reactions only makes our dog more excited. The louder we become, the more excited and wild he becomes. Now, instead of thinking that our dog is misbehaving and not listening to me, I am now taking a calmer approach and just waiting for the dog to calm down before feeding him or rewarding him with a treat.

I have also been using some of the dominant behavior techniques that Cesar describes. For example, when our dog is too excited, I ask him to sit down and if he doesn't listen, I walk towards him slowly and calmly and he calms down too. Our dog is still a work in progress - but he is a testament of Cesar's methods.

Our dog has been excitable all of his life and now he is becoming ""calm and submissive"" - I think he is much happier too because he is older and has arthritis -- it is much easier on him being calmer. I think he feels more secure in his position in our household as well. He doesn't get negative attention and he is rewarded for his calm behavior.

I disagree with the reviewers who say that Cesar uses harsh methods of discipline. He does firmly touch them (kind of like a poke) but that's about it. Also, if those people have watched his show, many of the dogs that he works with don't have a peaceful home life. Most of the owners have tried obedience training and many of the dogs are aggressive and dangerous. Many of the owners are at the end of their rope and Cesar has saved countless dogs from losing their homes and/or lives.

Cesar has made a positive impact on many dogs including our old little pug dog.",1210982400,6,2102,4.245
