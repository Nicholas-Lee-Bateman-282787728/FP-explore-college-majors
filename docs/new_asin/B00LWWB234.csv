8668636,5,B00LWWB234,"How nice to have a set devoted to women directors from around the world.  It's about time!  These are all award-winning films chosen from the Film Movement catalog, and therefore each also comes with a short film as a bonus.  The films have nothing in common aside from their quality and the fact that they are directed by women, but that shows in itself that women directors should have more attention than they do, since they are every bit as good as men, with just as much to say in their films.
