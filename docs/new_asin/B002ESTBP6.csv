8368313,4,B002ESTBP6,"Amazon: All About Dung, 100 minutes. DVD  2007.

 The terminology used throughout the video is limited to dung and poo.  Various segments can find good use by a teacher (who has established a solid reputation in the classroom) in lessons on science, agriculture, nutrition, entomology and social studies. Grade level for various segments could vary from middle school to college.

 The ten sections that will cue to the DVD controls are all narrated by Monty Halls who brings some occasional machismo to parts but keeps the humor appropriate. The introduction is rather short.

 The first topical section on fossilized dung uses the term coprolite and eases the viewer into the topic and its scientific value as an indicator of food habits, etc.

  The third section on Holy Cow illustrates the extensive use and value of cow dung in the culture of the Indian subcontinent.

 The fourth section in Africa provides some excellent footage of the variety of dung beetles that inhabit rhino and elephant dung, as well as the Egyptian value of the scarab beetle as an object in worship.

 The largest amount of dung is the mountain of guano produced over time by bats; the resulting environment being a microcosm of other organisms that thrive in this ecosystem.

 The sixth segment traces the invention of gunpowder from saltpeter that in turn was originally derived from precipitates from excrement.

 The use of excrement as food includes the production of a variety of very expensive coffee from beans that pass through the digestive tract of a civet cat.

 The ninth segment examines how we process the huge amount of waste, with a brief vignette on the discovery of waste-born pathogens.

 Finally, the use of wastes as sources of biogas and other beneficial products concludes the video.",1450137600,,1789,4.989830508474577

Being a Texas girl, I wonder now, why,  the History Channel left us out.  Tossing cow 'chips' is one of our favorite pastimes.  :)",1400371200,,297,4.8
