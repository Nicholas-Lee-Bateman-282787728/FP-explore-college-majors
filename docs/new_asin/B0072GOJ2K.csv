Great picture quality!
Great films!
Great entertainment!",1374192000,3,299,4.711538461538462
5049746,5,B0072GOJ2K,"These 2 great films are 2 of the best examples of what Shaw Brothers brought to the film industry, particulary, the martial arts genre. These films highlight so many styles of martial arts and the actors/martial artists are superb for the characters they play. Not saying that these films should have won awards for the acting, but for what it is, it is simply amazing! Avenging Eagle is a tale of revenge for past wrongs and without giving anything away, everybody has to pay for their wrongs. Blood Brothers is a tale of brotherhood, greed, lust, jealousy and envy. Both films are full of great martial arts fight scenes. I highly recommend this 2-disc set!",1372550400,4,659,4.739130434782608
5049747,3,B0072GOJ2K,"If you are a fan of the kung fu genre, you can do a lot worse than these two movies.  So, pop them in the DVD player, sit down with your popcorn and enjoy some fun time.",1370995200,,169,3.5675675675675675
5049748,4,B0072GOJ2K,"The movies are great and they have good Picture quality. Cheap buy for 2 movies in one pack and its 2 discs.

The bad for me is the art work from Dragon Dynasty. The art is bad and the clothing and weapons in the art are not even in the film. They have done that for the last 8 movies I think. But I am not hurt by it as the  Picture quality is more important.

I give this a 4 the movie them selves get different ratings
Blood brothers 4 out of 5

8508869,5,B0072GOJ2K,I grew up watching Kung Fu movies and The Avenging Eagle is my all time favorite! But what surprised me is the picture quality! I'm talking HD all the way! You'd think the movie was released in 2015 instead of 1978!,1425340800,,215,4.2682926829268295

8508873,5,B0072GOJ2K,"One of my favorite movies is the Avenging Eagle. I even got a few of my friends hooked on it, so they too went out and bought the original VHS, then upgraded to DVD (thought the quality wasn't that great).

When one of those friends told me that Dragon Dynasty had released the movie on DVD and the quality was much better than the washed out 70's transfer we use to have on DVD, I had to get it. I'm glad I found this double-feature version for less than $5.

Watched Avenging Eagle with my four kids this week. They too loved it and the dialogue got some good chuckles out of us, ""Wait. Get 'em!"" (must see the movie to know what I mean).

I was very, very happy with the quality of the transfer. Nice colors and clear.

I've never seen Blood Brother's, but we'll probably watch that later this week.

This is totally worth it only for Avenging Eagle.
My kids make a new generation of fans of the movie. Viva la Avenging Eagle!

**Update 6/21/14**
We wound up watching Blood Brother's today.
Long drawn out movie with lots of people rolling downhill. We did not like this movie much at all.",1403308800,2,1092,4.302439024390244

8508876,5,B0072GOJ2K,"Dragon Dynasty may have just paired these two excellent Shaw Brothers flicks together for having Ti Lung (and fans of his are certainly going to love his performances in both films) in common, but there's an added benefit that one is very strong on action and the other is very strong on characters and story.

Avenging Eagle stars Ti Lung as a skilled fighter who breaks out of a ""once you're in, you're always in -- unless you kill absolutely everybody to get out"" evil cult. Along the way he gets some unexpected help from a warrior played by Sheng Fu. The story in this one is light, however it's jammed packed with action. I hadn't seen anything directed by Chung Sun before, but he definitely had a skill for keeping things exciting. Like most Shaw Brothers films, the cast is full of familiar faces, all of whom put on a good show. There's not a dull moment through the entire film.

Then, on the next disk, you get Cheh Chang's character driven Blood Brothers (which has been remade as The Warlords with Jet Li and Andy Lau, although I've yet to see that film). The story in this one is less standard for golden age kung fu, following a group of three close-knit bandits through much of their lives as they grow in power and aspirations -- or in the case of one of them, fail to grow in aspirations. Ti Lung shines as the most ambitious of the three, a man bent on growing up from skilled, yet small-time bandit, to being a rebellion crushing general in the service of the emperor. A vicious love triangle develops along the way, and unravels into a vicious, bloody, fantastic climactic battle. The film frames the story within a trial and confession which works very well. The opening scene immediately reveals the end result, but Cheh Chang's excellent direction makes it wonderful to watch the story unfold. The acting is marvellous, especially for a kung fu film, there's not really any ""hammy"" moments, and the few battles stay strikingly realistic.

All in all, for a good slice of Shaw Brothers, this is a great combo dvd. I have others of their combo and multipacks, but while they all feature great kung fu movies, only this one provides an astounding balance between two styles. Whether you're just looking for an addition to your collection, or looking for a place to start, I strongly recommend this pack, especially as it's also wonderfully priced. Oh, and if you've not met Ti Lung yet, there's another reason to pick this up. I had only seen him in John Woo's Better Tomorrow films and was impressed with him there -- it was good to see that he was just as impressive and magnetic in the previous decade.",1393113600,2,2627,4.573248407643312
