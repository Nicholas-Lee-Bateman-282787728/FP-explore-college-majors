8190304,4,B000PC6X36,"In this video from her ""Time Saver Workouts"" series, instructor Keli Roberts presents a fast-moving workout focused on upper body and core work.  Keli and her two background exercisers are in brightly lit, colorful studio, and they use light dumbbells plus small medicine balls throughout the workout.

The workout is structured into five mini-workouts, or rounds, each of which consist of an upper body exercise with weights, an upper body exercise using the medicine ball, and finally, a core exercise (usually incorporating the ball).  Keli begins with a quick-paced, 4-minute warm-up that consists of moves such as shoulder rolls, squats, reaches, knees, and a jump in and out of plank.  The exercises in each round are listed on the back of the DVD case as follows (note that every round contains some type of push-up and/or plank move, so those with wrist issues may have problems):

Workout 1
Bilateral bent over row - Push up with ball under hand - Med ball hand to foot pass core stabilization

Workout 2
Unilateral row sequences - Push up with med ball roll hand to hand - Med ball under feet plank/hip extension balance

Workout 3
Clean and press - Push up with hands on med ball - C V-sit med ball rotations with touch down

Workout 4
Bicep curl w1/leg balance - Lateral raise & external rotation - Back extension with med ball in hands overhead

Workout 5
Push up and Row - B Rhomboid lift - Opposite hand and leg raise

Keli concludes the workout with approximately 3 minutes of nice stretching for the upper body, bringing the total time in just shy of 30 minutes.  Each round is individually chaptered, so you could easily shorten/customize the workout.  The Main Menu of the DVD list's Keli's Introduction (very short overview), Play all Workouts, Select Workout (chapters), and Bonus Features.  Bonuses include 3 3-minute clips from other workouts (Breakthrough Lower Body and Core, Flexibility for the Inflexible, and ASAP: Abs, Spine, & Posture), bloopers and behind the scenes, and previews of other workouts by Keli.

Overall, this was a pretty solid workout, and the time just flew by.  I was a little put off by the fact that Keli used light weights throughout--her light dumbbells were appropriate for some of the exercises, such as the rhomboid work, but most of the other moves demanded heavier weights.  However, there is a lot of flexibility to this workout, and it probably could be customized to meet the needs of most experienced beginner to intermediate exercisers.",1189382400,14,2498,4.897862232779097
8190305,4,B000PC6X36,"Keli Roberts is one of the best instructors out there.  She's definately in my top 5 favourites.  She's motivating, knows her stuff and will give you results if you stick with these kinds of workouts.
This workout is very varied where you quickly go from one kind of movement to the next.  Going from move to move, you work all muscles from head to toe.  Within working each muscle, you work those same muscles in different ways like a regular push up and then a push up on a medicine ball - so to work the same muscles with different types of intensity and depth.  She cues this really well like usual and it's fun to do.  You will feel the burn, but the results are going to come with consistancy.  I've done this twice already and love it and while I'm sore the next day, it's a good sore and I enjoy this workout a lot.  Another great Keli dvd.",1187308800,11,848,4.22360248447205
