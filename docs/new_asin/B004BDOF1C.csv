4316282,4,B004BDOF1C,"No spoilers here, because I hope you'll see this fun film!

The title gives you the main plot.  Aliens encounter Earthlings, but they don't do it in the modern era, but back 125 years ago, perhaps 20 years after the Civil War.  And why not?  Do aliens wait until the present time to decide to take a side trip to good ole Earth?

Playing as a straight Western, which is where most of the movie is set, Cowboys and Aliens is a pretty darn good one.  Based upon a graphic novel (fancy comic book), C&A has a great look.  It's dirty and dusty, and the small, dying Western town looks just right. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique uses the New Mexico locations to his advantage here.  The rugged landscape is forbidding, stark, and desolate.

The plot as a Western isn't terribly original, but it's a decent one.  There are good guys in the town, and bad guys, with a ne're-do-well son of the town's richest citizen making trouble as they just seem won't to do.

Then, the aliens show up.

The special effects, some of which are done by Industrial Light and Magic, and as good as you'd expect (although why do aliens always have to be so complex looking?  They ooze mucus, they have body parts which open up and reveal surprises, and they just don't look as streamlined as, say, humans do.).  Anyway, the special effects are excellent, the flying craft excellent, and the explosions are very well done.

Over all, the film gets four-and-a-half stars.  Harrison Ford is looking as craggy as he ages nicely.  Daniel Craig is as tough as they come, and Olivia Wilde (best known as one of the docs from 'House') is pretty, thin, and angular as you remember.  The pace never falters, and the action non-stop, and there are the predictable surprises that bring a big gasp from the audience.  There are a few plot 'huhs?', such as the reason for the aliens moseying down the space trail to Earth, but it is internally consistent if you buy why they are here.

Recommended.  A good, solid, big-budget summer blockbuster from Dreamworks.",1311984000,24,2024,4.61344537815126
4316283,2,B004BDOF1C,"I have to say that when I first heard about the concept of Cowboys and Aliens I laughed out loud.  It sounded like fun - like Blazing Saddles meets Space Balls - and I'd have loved to see a serious satire about aliens invading the old West.  Then I read they meant to keep it serious, like maybe True Grit meets Predator.  That sounded good, too.  After all, if there really were aliens  who had the capacity to come to Earth it makes sense that they wouldn't just visit L.A. in the present.  Why wouldn't they show up in medieval Europe, or even the wild West?  I'd love to see what the man with no name does with a xenomorph.  I really liked what Favreau did with Iron Man, and liked the Star Trek reboot by the writers of this show, so I ended up deciding to check this out when it played in our local theater.

It turns out, though, the film didn't live up either to its initial hilarity or the subsequent promise of a serious Western in which the townsfolk are abducted by aliens.  They should have gone for funny, because my wife and I laughed out loud as the film hit clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;.  I believe it's supposed to be loosely adapted from a graphic novel, but it felt like the writers decided to watch a bunch of Westerns and sci-fi flicks and then tried to come up with a plot that would give them a chance to hit them all.  The nameless drifter with a criminal past, the apparent prostitute with a heart of gold, the manipulative cattle boss and his psychopathic son, the native Americans with their wisdom rituals, the toothless bandits, the familial reconciliation, the ride off into the sunset...and then why is it that after Alien every sentient being from outer space has an outer shell that opens up to reveal internal mouths and other body parts?

They hired decent actors and then gave them lines that were laughable.  They tried to sell Harrison Ford as a greedy and vicious man, who had the whole town under his thumb - in a role reversal of the type that worked brilliantly when Sergio Leone cast Henry Ford as the cruel force of evil in Once Upon a Time in the West.  It didn't work here - both because I didn't find Ford convincing as a bad guy and because the writers chickened out and let him turn out to have a soft side.  They ended up explaining why Olivia Wilde seemed so implausibly awestruck by the sight of Daniel Craig - but even when it was clear who she was her story didn't make sense.  Without revealing anything specific I'll just say it's utterly implausible that, being who she said she was, she'd be there just waiting for the coincidence that Daniel Craig's character happened to have the knowledge and the power that she'd travelled so far to find.  That's just one among many loose ends in the story.  I have a lot of patience, but I found the first half of the film to be overly boring and long.  Eventually it had a few thrilling moments - they didn't entirely waste their special effects budget - and that's why I'm giving it two stars, since if you were distracted and bored at home there might be worse things to do than waste time watching this one.",1311897600,,3114,4.39198606271777
4316284,2,B004BDOF1C,"I worry for Daniel Craig. It seems like it will take a lot for him to prove to the world that he's capable of doing more than playing James Bond. And furthermore, it doesn't look like he'll be any more able to pull off a performance as Mikael Blomkvist in the upcoming Dragon Tattoo remake. Because just an hour ago, I got out of the movie that may just be solid proof of his inability to act outside his comfort zone... Cowboys and Aliens.

I'll admit I didn't have any expectations for this movie except just a fun and enjoyable blow-em-up alien flick. In fact, something with such a title as ""Cowboys and Aliens"" should not be boring. And a cast like Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde should help offer SOMETHING of that promise. Unfortunately, the movie has its head so far up in the clouds, it thinks it's something other than what it should be.

I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.

Anyways, back to the ""plot"". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later innthe film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.

Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.

Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign.

In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway. In fact, we see more spaceships than aliens. And the aliens look dumb anyways. Do they give razzies for CG? Because they look so bad, they make the aliens in Battle LA look awesome.

The movie gets two of three stars for Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde, both the best things about this film, and the third star for the beautiful Arizona locations. The rest... yawn.

OVERALL: 3/10

Pros: Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford give good performances, as well as the location is great.

Cons: Cowboys And Aliens is essentially a fun-less, boring, slow and plodding dirge with boring action and pointless subplots that do nothing but drag a film that should be 85 minutes to a boring 2 hours.",1311897600,7,3338,4.352090032154341
4316285,5,B004BDOF1C,I just saw this in the movies and i would start off by saying that this film is well worth watching it starts off with jake lonerman a man who knows nothing about his past. the film quickly picks up after the first 15-20 minutes of the films start and does not stop. If i were to compare this film with any universal film it would be the mummy part 2 and 3 the way the action was in those films were very much like the way they filmed this movie. the end were the cowboys and the indians come together (yes there is a battle scene were the aliens and the humans fight. a big but well done battle scene) was like id4 in my mind were people came together and fought the aliens. I really really encourage people to watch this movie it is worth checking out! I think it is really sad when people have to bash a film just because it mixes two different ideas. People just give it a chance it is a great idea and a great movie but like i said before this movie is done in somewhat the same manner that the mummy 2 and 3 where done. not a great story but not a bad one story. lots of action but not to much action. trust me it is a great film.,1311897600,5,1136,3.9220779220779223
4316286,5,B004BDOF1C,"A man awakens in the desert to complete memory loss. The only clue to his past is a picture of a young woman and a metal contraption locked around his forearm. When he arrives in a nearby town of Absolution, trouble isn't far behind. But when strange lights from the sky arrive and begin shooting up the town and abducting its residents, the survivors decide to risk all to hunt the kidnappers and find their loved ones.

Daniel Craig plays the amnesiac who comes to be known as Jake Lonergan. Craig is a stoic, hard man with a soft heart. When his past is revealed it's a bit of a shock, since it seemed to be against his nature. Harrison Ford also stars as Woodrow Dolarhyde, a tough war veteran, now rich and feared by the town and his employees. Sam Rockwell is Doc, a saloon owner who tries to toughen up to save his wife from abduction. And Olivia Wilde is the mysterious and beautiful Ella who seems to know something about Jake. The acting is solid and believable. Each character stands out and made the film worth watching.

The characters and their stories are really what made the film. While the men had rough and tough exteriors, there was still plenty of heart. The feel was definitely a Western meets Alien, with plenty of violence and intense suspense and action. Clever one-liners throughout gave the film some much-needed laughs and light-hearted moments. Fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat excitement from beginning to end, Cowboys & Aliens certainly lives up to the hype.

The story is only roughly based on the original graphic novel. This is a different story, yet still has riveting characters, a mystery, and non-stop adventure. This was the film I was looking forward to most this summer. And I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. The Old West setting was charming yet gritty. And the aliens are brutal and extremely powerful, but underestimate humans, so it's not a completely hopeless situation, nor silly. Both genres are treated with respect. Flawlessly blending Western action and gun-slinging with a high-tech alien invasion, this summer blockbuster is completely unique and altogether fantastic.",1311811200,227,2124,4.894444444444445

A posse is formed but tracking down the whereabouts of the aliens isn't as easy as it seems.  They keep running into people who seem bent on killing them.  All these distractions aside, they do eventually make it to their objective.  They circle the space ship and attack, with mixed results.
Neither sci-fi nor a western, this strange hybrid is considered to be one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.  The big budget was 163 million, making a measly 174.8 millionbarely breaking even.

Its right up there with Snakes on a Plane, when it comes to the bonkers scale (and the the title says it all scale). Yes, this is hokum of the highest order and yet it works, just about. The script is far from subtle and the characterization is as hackneyed as it comes, but its fun to see the high-tech threat of alien invasion transposed to the old Wild West. There are some humorous touches, even though the film does take itself rather too seriously most of the time. The cast are all excellent in their roles and the special effects are good if a little underwhelming. Of course, the whole movie relies on the fact that the aliens, despite being able to build interstellar spacecraft, are all as dumb as a bag of rocks and unable to find almost any significant target even with their advanced weaponry.

""First contact, last stand"" - ""Aliens & Cowboys"" movie tagline.

Four STEADFAST Stars. Cowboys & Aliens combines two separate genres into an adventurous plot. Aliens come to Earth in the 1870s and cause a ruckus among the cowboys and women of Absolution Arizona who are terrified. The movie uses very good CGI to bolster the action scenes. There is some predictability near the end. Starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach, Abigail Spencer, Walton Goggins, Clancy Brown, Buck Taylor, Keith Carradine, Matthew Taylor, Cooper Taylor, Paul Dano, and more. Directed by Jon Favreau. Four UNUSUAL Stars. (Universal pictures. Rated PG-13. Color. HD. LCC. Time-1 hr, 58 minutes.)",1503014400,2,710,5.339285714285714

While it was a somewhat enjoyable film in many ways and quite entertaining in a mindless way, I probably would go with such a low rating because they've done something that so many others do--they've made the aliens so strong and fast that it's absolutely ridiculous to think that they could be defeated by a ragtag group of outlaws and Apache warriors, along with a guy with a super-weapon on his wrist.  It's just silly--you can make aliens strong to make the audience admire the victors for having defeated them, but not so strong that they're practically invincible.",1501372800,,859,4.644736842105263

I had to do a retake on my thoughts on choosing this movie anyway, I mean aliens VS cowboys? What I actually thought I was going to see was cowboys in the 21st century instead of the 18th. My bad I guess. Overall it's mildly entertaining. The aliens are brutish things and it make one wonder how they could even conceive of the vessels and machinery they had brought to earth with them. The animations CGI was the industry norm for this film so that made it watchable. I thought the story line was rather vague and wandering. Still I watched it all the way through.

4316728,4,B004BDOF1C,"(NO Spoilers). Because of the confusing way I think Amazon handles reviews for movies (they tend to combine all movie editions into one set of reviews, making it difficult to know which version/edition of a movie is being reviewed), I now notate the particular edition/version of a movie I am reviewing at the beginning of my reviews when possible. This particular review is for the 2011 2 disc extended edition blu-ray version of this movie (UPC: 025192107184).

Sometimes the title of a movie tends to send someone off in the wrong direction. For example, I kept encountering the title of a movie called Killer Klowns of Outer Space and thinking that with a title like that, it couldn't possibly be a movie to take seriously. One year, I finally decided to give in and gave it a look. It turned out to be a hilarious, very entertaining movie which I now watch regularly.

Similarly, looking at the title Cowboys and Aliens, I didn't think that it could possibly be a worthwhile movie. I started looking into it in more detail however and found an impressive list of movie making names associated with the movie in one manner or another:

Harrison Ford
Daniel Craig
Ron Howard
Steven Spielberg
Lucasfilm
Industrial Light and Magic

Since these are some pretty big names in the movie industry, I decided to give the movie a closer look. First of all, despite all of the Hollywood horsepower associated with the film, it apparently was a box office failure. Its not particularly clear why this happened although some say it is because the combination of aliens and the wild west was too unusual. It is precisely because of that combination that I found this movie so intriguing however (I also wonder if the movie was as heavily promoted as it could have been at the time).

Just having Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford starring in the same film would be enough to recommend the movie on its own but I found that this one gives you so much, much more. There are so many UFO/Alien movies that have been made over the years it is probably impossible to count them all. I cant recall having ever seen one that combines aliens in a western though, particularly one as well made as this one is.

First of all, the look of the movie on blu-ray is absolutely spectacular, as is the audio. I think that movies which have a great amount of outdoor scenery look particularly good on blu-ray when well done and the cinematography here is outstanding. Also, the movie is almost completely set outdoors and the special effects are spectacular (as you might expect from Lucasfilm et al). There really isn't much to the plot but there really doesnt need to be. While the movie is not a comedy, the dialogue is quite tongue in cheek in many places and Harrison Ford in particular seems to be really, really enjoying himself in front of the camera.

Overall, I am glad I happened upon this movie and after having it for only a few months, I have already watched it several times. Dont let the negative reception of this film scare you off. Cowboys and Aliens is several hours of good, fun entertainment.",1464134400,,3083,4.635531135531136

4316730,4,B004BDOF1C,"Not quite a 4 star movie, but the liberal amount of strong LFE had me give it an extra 1/2 star to make it 4/5. Movie is kind of cheezy, but then again I figured as much prior to viewing. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford give good performances and the supporting cast also did well. Blu Ray quality was very good and the audio was also very good, with solid scenes of LFE. Good one to get if you have a capable subwoofer.",1463875200,,419,4.0602409638554215
4316731,2,B004BDOF1C,"Wow, not that good and it was already painfully long enough, certainly does not need this extended directors cut.  Slightly deserving of more than one star because of high production work, at the end of the day there is nothing really that stands out about this film in a positive way.  The character development is poor, roles are weak, plot pretty average, and while some some special effects are good many are quite bad. Considering all the famous names associated with it the movie is a solid stinker.  Rent at first for sure if you are curious.  Even Harrison Ford or Daniel Craig fans will likely find that one viewing is enough.",1463875200,,635,4.642857142857143

4316814,3,B004BDOF1C,"Some unconscious man wakes up in the middle of the American dessert apparently not knowing who is, how he got there, how he got this mysterious bracelet on his wrist, etc. We, as the viewer, really don't know this at this point but kinda guess it. Three strange men show up on horses and ask for directions. Then the man kills them all, picks over their bodies and rides to the nearest town. The town's rich guy's son is drunk and shooting up the town. The sheriff shows up and arrests the son and the strange man as the strange man is evidently a horrible criminal who has been wanted. As the sheriff is about to ride the chained criminals up state to turn them over to the state police the dad shows up. He gets knocked down. So the sheriff starts off again on for aliens, yes, aliens, to show up and start ""lassoing"" people from aircraft, taking them off to wherever. The prisoners break free. Everyone bands together to go fight the aliens and return the towns people with the help of some strange woman who follows them.

I think the way the movie started off you would think it was a ""true western""--tough, rough, etc. But the PC stuff creeps in when the rich guy cries over his lost Indian son and the Indian son was loyal to his white dad. Gag. The aliens were rehashed creatures. The reason that they were here has been done many times. Even their ""nest"" looked like a NASA rocket. How lazy is that? It was little weird to see James Bond in a western. He even wore his over zealously tailored pants (can that man wear underwear in these movies with his pants so tight?). And like all other British he spoke so low to speak in an American accent I could barely understand him. I think they thought it might work given his loner incognito persona. But it was just annoying.",1457308800,,1780,4.36144578313253

Some big names were associated with this movie, including Spielberg and Ron Howard.

So much fun seeing Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford playing opposite each other in very competitive roles. Marvelous, plot, screenwriting never off, timing is never off. The action and special effects look like they were done this year! This film combines two genres Western and Sci-fi and is not even remotely cheesy. The real story is about how men who have indulged in violence, hatred, bigotry and selfishness discover a different reason to live, a different way to live and well redemption. And that's not cheesy either... And there is an incredibly beautiful woman-like lady-thing in a climactic scene where she is clothed in nothing but flame and smoke.

I know that they were designed to be a scary monster type alien, but thats exactly why I thought it took away from the overall theme of the move.  Why did the writers think they had to be so hideous?  It would have been much more interesting if they were more like the Klingons in Star Trek.  I grew up back in the 50s and 60s watching movies like the Blob, we need to get away from that type of alien and make them more realistic.",1448582400,,535,4.066666666666666

4317035,4,B004BDOF1C,"Despite a title that suggests a very bad comedy, Cowboys and Aliens is actually a very entertaining action film that stays surprisingly true to the classic Western genre. Yes, the plot does require a pretty generous leap of faith to accept, even in terms of movies, but think about itis the basic concept really any more far-fetched than Independence Day or War of the Worlds? But still, the story does sound a bit bizarre at first blush. Daniel Craig plays a man who wakes up in the Arizona desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. A strange metal bracelet is fastened on his wrist, one that doesn't look like anything fashioned by mortal man and won't come off. Looking for answers, Craig's character rides into the nearest town, one where Woodrow Dollarhyde (Harrison Ford) lords it over the townsfolk with his money and fearsome reputation. But there's also a strange, alluring woman named Ella, a woman who knows something bad is coming, and who may hold the key to the benighted cowboy's past.

And something bad is comingstrange flying things from the sky, things that have weapons no Earthman has ever seen before, things that grab people from the town's streets and take them up into their depths. What are these strange invaders? Are they demons? Beings from another world? And how can they be defeated? Somehow, Craig's mysterious cowboy holds the key.

It's an original take on a couple of old Hollywood standby'sthe Alien Invasion flick and the classic Western. Amazingly, the two polar opposites come together quite well. The Western setting is gritty and unforgiving, while Craig and Ford play their characters with a sincerity that makes suspension of disbelief a little easier. Olivia Wilde is her usual gorgeous self, and her character remains full of surprises all movie long. The alien invaders themselves are extremely vicious and rather imposing creatures, the perfect movie villains. Special effects are outstanding, and the action nearly nonstop.

Director Jon Favreau fashions a fantastic but not altogether unbelievable tale out of it all, and even if the combo of sci-fi and gunslinger shouldn't work, it does.

4317072,3,B004BDOF1C,"I had expected Cowboys & Aliens to be an entertaining turkey about drunken desperadoes fighting little green men from Neptune. In reality, the film is a surprisingly competent western/scyfy crossover. It begins as a typical western, with all the usual ingredients. Guns and guts are the law in the small town of Absolution, run by a sociopathic Civil War veteran and his handpicked sheriff. When the local despot's arrogant son shoots a deputy and is roughed up by a wanted gunfighter, we all expect the boys to gather at the OK Corral for a last stand-off.

Then, UFOs show up

Surprisingly enough, the evil aliens and their space craft blend in perfectly with the Wild West universe, don't ask me how! Whoever made Cowboys & Aliens did it with an entirely straight face and got away with it. Indeed, there's less humor and one-liners in this flick than in most other Hollywood productions. I have seldom seen such a serious movie with such an impossible plot! I won't reveal all the plot twists, but they do include alien abductions, missing time, a lot of Apaches, a gold rush and a human who isn't what he/she seems to be

Cowboys & Aliens will never beat Clint Eastwood alias Blondie, but it works pretty well as Friday night entertainment. I therefore give it the OK Corral rating, three stars!",1436659200,2,1300,4.71806167400881

There is so much going on that it will take repeated viewings to sort it all out, and that is fine with me, 'cause it is therapeutic watching the aliens get kicked out.

Not a show for young viewers but there are none of them here. I think the next time we watch we will use the subtitles. Some actors speak so softly and the background is loud, but that is almost a non issue.",1436486400,,608,4.109243697478991

4317133,4,B004BDOF1C,"Finally got around to watching this one. Bought it about the time it became available and it just sort of hung about there in my Amazon Cloud Locker or whatever they call that thing. Not sure why that was...maybe it was my fear as a fan of both Westerns AND Science Fiction that it might let me down on SO many levels that put me off.

I should've had more faith.

This movie is FUN!

Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are...well...you know what you're going to get with them and you, by God GET it! They NEVER disappoint!
I can only compare Harrison to the late John Wayne in his ability to age gracefully and still play tough characters believably (and without any CGI redesign of his person) past the age of 50 AND 60 AND 65 just as Wayne did.

When he looks at Craig and says ""Oh, no, you ain't James Bond"" (whips out a picture of Sean Connery) ""My DAD is James Bond!"" I nearly fell off my seat suffocating with laughter.

What? That scene isn't in the movie? Not even the extended edition DVD?

Huh.

I must have dreamed it then.

Too bad...would've been a good scene.

ANYWAY...what you can expect: Think ""Snakes on a Plane"" only with Cowboys, and aliens, and no planes.

Think Keith Carradine (son of John and younger brother of David) whom I haven't seen since he got thrown off a train by Lee Marvin in Emperor of the North Pole. (well, and that ""Material Girl"" video by Madonna all those years ago).

Think Clancy Brown (THE HIGHLANDER, PET SEMATARY II, BLUE STEEL. BIKER MICE FROM MARS)

Yeah, BIKER MICE FROM MARS.

(Well, at least I didn't have to say LLAMAS WITH HATS).

Moving on: Think Olivia Wilde.

Yes, men, (and gay women) think Olivia Wilde.

(Pause for thought)

WELL, THAT was fun!

Moving on we've got Native Americans, we've got Aliens. we've got UFOs, and we've got Jake Lonergan and that thing on his wrist that recalls ""D's"" weird hand ""thing"" in the Vampire Hunter D anime movies.

We've got action, adventure, and things blowing up.

I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford and have come to enjoy Daniel Craig over the past ten years in various performances.  There is a lot of action and some subtle physical humor in this film that I really enjoyed.  What makes this film unique is that mankind is not even remotely close to the technological advancement of the aliens; unlike, say, movies like Independence Day; this leads to a real uphill battle for the good guys.  The science-fiction aspect of the film makes for several interesting twists.  I like that they have taken two different film genres, the western and science-fiction, and merged them so convincingly that the end product is completely interesting, fun, and does not stretch the viewer's credibility meter out of proportion.  This is an entertaining film that will not be a waste of time, which is the one factor of life that cannot be replaced.",1432944000,,1027,4.735955056179775

Daniel Craig was the perfect choice, But Harrison Ford should not have been cast for his character. He was great in Star Wars and as Indiana Jones but not in this movie, The bar owner was a laughable character as was Harrison Fords son, The advanced aliens didn't even have a language, they just grunted.

4317325,5,B004BDOF1C,"Based on a comic book of the same name, & similar plot.  Fantastic sci fi action adventure movie that mixes the time honored genre of the old wild west with modern space alien fantasy.

Cowboys vs Aliens, a fun idea made into a film.  Daniel Craig & Harrison Ford are an awesome duo, plus Olivia Wilde is beautiful
 Basic plot; Wild outlaw cowboy Daniel Craig has lost his memory & identity for unknown reasons, & walks into an old west town finding he has this mysterious high tech space age wrist device on his body he cannot remove.  When in danger the magical device becomes a ""Star Wars / Star Trek"" like weapon, making him virtually invincible to other adversarial cowboys who cross him.

 When mysterious space aliens attack a remote town & kidnap it's residents, wealthy established cattle rancher, former Civil War soldier Harrison Ford teams up with Craig & a small posse of town survivors to lead an expedition to investigate the cause of the abductions, and rescue and avenge the victims of an all powerful space alien invasion force.

 With the help of the beautiful and mysterious Olivia Wilde, along with teaming up with other outlaws and Native American Indian warriors who were also victims, the group of heroes takes on the alien menace to save the Old West and the world in an intergalactic showdown.

1.) Interesting note, Daniel Craig has one of the alien's weapons at his disposal, giving him a drastic tactical advantage over other cowboys but he is still out numbered when he is pitted against the aliens themselves who have the same technology.  Thus Craig is forced to not only use his physical skills, but his mental intellect to outsmart these diabolical other worldly monsters.

2.) Ford's character is dark tormented soul because of the horrors he had witnessed in the Civil War & the loss of his wife, whose alliance with outlaw cowboy Craig & their crusade to save the Old West makes him realize that a Native American ranch hand under his employment is more of a son to him then his own flawed & foolish biological son.  In this team up with Craig's character he also realizes that he is a good man, who has a responsibility to his Old West town to be a better human being, a better business man, and a real leader for their town.  Both Craig and Ford's characters are redeemed through their mission to save humanity against these demonic creatures.

 One element I could not fully get at the film's conclusion, which victim does Daniel Craig's character morn for more?  His wife or Wilde?

 I think this movie sets up for a sequel and I would honestly love to see Wilde & Daniel Craig return for another wild west space aliens adventure.

 Just a simple line in this movie actually says an awful lot to masses of people around the world, ""God doesn't care who you were son, just who you are now.""  That is pretty darn profound when one thinks of the meaning of that message and it makes the entire film work. What if a man or woman did make big mistakes or were bad guys. negative actors on the world scene, can that person become someone better and find redemption through good deeds now?

 Very powerful insight for a film that is simply a sci fi tribute to retro movies of the past.  A- for Ford, Craig, and Olivia Wilde.",1424304000,,3258,4.575862068965518

You'll be a PR dream to ol Crazy Joe. He may want to rectal probe YOU. Ah the irony.
I guess just stay were you have been staying since you've been here with your Scientology protectors and their pretty baby blue clubhouse. And no, not all humans are 4 1/2 feet tall. Get over yourselves. Tom Cruise can't help it. Just Pretend that you believe their nonsense and never be caught behind that useless e-meter.  They'll soak you for every alien dime you have on you. Then whose gonna pay for gas going home??  Head back to Texas and over to hacienda de Bush. Your way in ...., fawn over his cute paintings.

4317491,3,B004BDOF1C,"This is movie works pretty well as a western and pretty well as Sci-Fi.  I enjoyed it, overall.  But I do have a complaint which bugs me about so many movies of the Modern Era:

Why in the hell do directors think that all the actors must continually whisper their lines, or at least speak in a very low tone?  How do they expect you to hear the dialogue?

No matter what the situation in any given modern movie, you are continually forced to try to hear low-volume dialogue against the background sound effects, and music (?).  Perhaps this works well at a theater where the sound volume is pumped up to a deafening level, but when you have such low-volume dialogue, on the DVD version you have to continually adjust the volume louder and then down again when the next blast occurs.  Please, Directors.....give this some thought.  It is not natural for people to whisper when they are just conversing normally, and especially not when there is a tense situation at hand.  When you watch this movie, notice how often the actors can barely be heard.

Older movies, during the first 40 or 50 years of making 'talkies', kept the sound volume at a listenable level.

The three extras on the disc, totaling around 20 minutes overall, are pretty interesting in showing how the stunts were performed and how the special effects were done.",1416096000,,1330,4.617021276595745

Daniel Craig, in the lead role, plays a pretty good cowboy for a man from across the pond.  Harrison Ford, with his withered looks, is always believable in a role like this.  He was not far from his Indiana Jones role.

There is enough fun and action to keep you interested.  When it comes down to it, that's what it's all about.  This is worth watching a few times.",1414886400,,592,4.223214285714286

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The intermingling of genres like science-fiction and the western is really nothing new in film, but the CGI-laden 'Cowboys & Aliens' aims to feel like something audiences haven't seen before. While not exactly as intelligently topical as Michael Crichton's 'Westworld' or amusingly subtle as Joss Whedon's 'Serenity,' Jon Favreau's action flick brings a good deal of engaging entertainment and exciting spectacle to the proceedings. It might not please every viewer out there, but it satisfies the wide-eyed fantasies of long-time devoted followers of both genres or at least, of this particular viewer.

1873. Arizona Territory. A stranger with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde [Harrison Ford]. It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breath-taking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realises he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. With the help of the elusive traveller Ella, he pulls together a posse comprised of former opponents-townsfolk, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde and his boys, outlaws and Apache warriors-all in danger of annihilation. United against a common enemy, they will prepare for an epic showdown for survival.

The films genre-mashup is quite overt and in your face, which could be seen as a bit of a drawback because it definitely shows a lack of finesse. It commences with a western theme and setting, suddenly switching to an alien invasion storyline that runs through the usual obstacle course. The change is surprisingly not as jarring as one would reasonably expect, although it takes some time to find its proper footing afterwards. The glue holding the marriage together is Jon Favreau's direction infused with several stylish nods to the archetypes and thematic of both styles, ranging again from explicit to sly.

Jake Lonergan [Daniel Craig] stars as our Man with No Name hero in the literal sense, waking up in the middle of a scorching desert without any recollection of who he is or why he carries a mysterious iron bracelet on his wrist. After a quickly determined fight with three bounty hunters, a clue into his past is revealed which nicely sets off that whole morally-ambiguous protagonist feel we love in a good 'ole shoot 'em up horse opera. Wearing Indiana Jones' fedora, the mystery man rides into a town conveniently named Absolution. This, too, pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film that is a little of the wittily clever mixed with the obvious.

It's not a complete loss, however, since it turns out 007 also makes a great anti-hero gunslinger. This is probably the best performance for Ganile Craig of a tough as nails and ill-tempered loner since Clint Eastwood's own iconic outlaw graced the screen, but to be perfectly honest, I wish it were seen in something far better than this, not that Jon Favreau's film isn't any fun though it is somewhat weighed down at the beginning of the second act. When the aliens finally attack the town, allowing Daniel Craig to discover his charm bracelet is actually a futuristic handgun, the thrill of sci-fi elements mixes well with the western ideal, but afterwards, things quickly slow down.

The outsider is set on his quest to free those kidnapped, as well as to obviously absolve past sins, in typical frontier justice style. His ragtag posse consists of local folk, each playing to the strengths of their clich. Harrison Ford is the most formidable as wealthy cattle rancher Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde. Beautiful Ella Swenson [Olivia Wilde] is the knows-more-than-she-lets-on Ella. Doc [Sam Rockwell] plays his part in his typical quiet fashion as a saloon owner with a medical background, while Percy Dolarhyde [Paul Dano] does the opposite as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhydes troubling-making son. Best surprise is Nat Colorado [Adam Beach] as Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde's Native American hired hand, bringing a welcome emotional subplot to an otherwise straightforward tale.

Sadly, that aspect to the script can only be seen fully on the extended cut of the film, which you will see on this Blu-ray disc, which adds 16 minutes of dialogue and scenes that explore it a bit more, also making it the superior version. What was seen theatrically surprisingly eliminates more sequences with the Native Americans doing a war dance and Nat Colorado [Adam Beach] is feeling disconnected from his people, like he doesn't belong in either world. It's a necessary component that makes a later heartfelt scene more powerful. In either case, 'Cowboys & Aliens' is a very enjoyable, action-packed thrill ride, serving the perfect popcorn-entertainment blend of two very beloved genres, but the extended cut of the film is definitely the preferred version.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Cowboys & Aliens' debuts on Blu-ray with an excellent, near-reference 1080p encoded image, filling the entire screen with tons of beautiful panoramic shots of New Mexico. Framed in an awesome 2.40:1 aspect ratio, Matthew Libatique's cinematography simply looks stunning, displaying incredible vistas of the desert plains and natural rock formations. The freshly-minted transfer shows remarkable clarity and definition, exposing the small, fine lines in the various wood buildings, the stitching on costumes and every pebble scattered about the ground. Facial complexions are beautifully detailed with lifelike textures, revealing the tiniest blemish, wrinkle and smudge of dirt on the faces of actors. Part of this rich, distinct clarity comes from a pitch-perfect contrast balance, extending visibility into the far distance. The picture carries an attractive cinematic appeal that's vibrant, crisp and glossy all around without feeling artificial or ruining highlights. The color palette is equally flashy with terrific, bold saturation, providing the image with lots of energy and pop. Being a western, of course, saturation hues pull their weight with a good deal of warmth and giving facial complexions a healthy tone that's accurate to the region. Blacks, on the other hand, are where we run into a bit of trouble, appearing inky and intense for a good chunk of the movie, but once indoors with natural, dim lighting, they look rather drab and murky. Since shadow delineation doesn't falter greatly during these sequences, it's possible it could all be the result of the photography and not a fault in the transfer. Taken as a whole, Jon Favreau's sci-fi western is spectacular on Blu-ray.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The genre-bending actioner audio track also serves as the perfect partner in crime, furnishing the excellent video with an equally exceptional 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. Being a cross with the science-fiction genre, the original design features a great deal of activity in the rears, especially during scenes with the alien spacecraft's. What appear like scout drones whiz by overheard convincingly and pan between the speakers with persuasive ease, extending the sound field with exciting effect. Imaging is widespread as other small atmospherics fill the back area, most notably when the posse spends the night inside an upside down steamboat. Even in the many segments of supposed silence, the track brings a satisfyingly immersive experience. Things remain first-rate in the front soundstage, feeling quite expansive with lots of detailed clarity. Off-screen effects and channel separation provide spacious warmth that's highly engaging thanks to a brilliant, room-penetrating mid-range. The upper frequencies are sharp and crisp, maintaining the loud noise amid the many moments of action clear and discernible. The low-end, also, comes with a heaping helping of powerful, very responsive bass, giving each gunshot and explosion a compelling force and weight. Dialogue and a few whispered conversations are delivered with great intelligibility and nicely focused in the centre of the screen, never drowned out by the rest of the action. Ignoring a very small numbers of inactive scenes, this sound mix of 'Cowboys & Aliens' sounds absolutely amazing and is exceedingly satisfying.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director John Favreau: John Favreau is very laid-back and relaxed; director Jon Favreau talks viewers through various aspects of the movie, primarily on cast, crew and characterization. It's a welcoming and easy-going conversation which clearly shows his love of filmmaking, the final outcome of this project and movies in general. It's also great hearing his thought process as auteur, the decisions he made while on set and what he was striving for in many scenes. Of real interest is finding the commentary track available on both versions of the movie and John Favreau acknowledges that by stating the one for the theatrical cut is edited. He also admits he prefers and believes the extended version is better, which I agree. It's good and pleasant track fans can get into.

Special Feature: Conversation with John Favreau [2011] [1080p] [80:00] A great collection of interview-like conversations of the director. Each can only be watched separately and shows Favreau chatting with his cast and crew on a variety of topics. It features Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof. What was interesting about this extra, is that Jon Favreau was originally going to film in 3D, but after test shooting, decided that the perspective would of be very off putting and would not enhance the final outlook of the film.

Special Feature: Igniting the Sky: The Making of `Cowboys & Aliens' [2011] [1080p]  [18:00] The making-of documentary is a much better look at the production and pretty comprehensive in its approach. Broken into five separate sections that can be watched seoerately or in all one go, and each one touches on various aspects such as the casting & characters. Each documentary is broken up as the following Absolution; A Call to Action here you have a closer discussion on John Favreau the director. The other three are Finding the Story; Outer-Space Icon and `The Scope of the Spectacle. Some of the contributors to these separate documentaries are as follows: Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Steven Spielberg, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, Jon Favreau, Olivia Wilde, Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Paul Dano, Keith Carradine, Adam Beach, Sam Rockwell and Ana de la Reguera.

Finally, Jon Favreau's 'Cowboys & Aliens' is an entertaining blend of two much loved film genres: the western and sci-fi. With strong performances of western archetypes, the mash-up of frontier-justice gunslingers and alien invasion disaster is far from perfect, but the story sticks to what it promises and delivers without completely going overboard. Daniel Craig stands out as our morally ambiguous anti-hero and it would be great to see him again in the same genre with stronger material. The Blu-ray invades homes with an excellent near-reference audio and video presentation, and features a wealth of exclusive supplements, making it a recommended package for fans and the curious alike. What I really love about this film, is its very different look on the Cowboy type genre film and is so different from anything I have seen before and is a very adventurous in its outlook and that is why every time I view this film, I get to see different things that I missed before, because there is so much action going on and it definitely keeps up the pace and the ending is a very satisfying experience and I am so happy to add this to my Blu-ray Collection and is also a brilliant reference Blu-ray disc for your Home Cinema set up, as with the surround sound, you will think you are in the thick of the action. Highly Recommended!

4317727,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and Aliens is fun. Let's drop the pretense of quality film analysis here, leave that to the pro critics and those that aspire to that lofty profession. Basing a review of this film on it's ""realism"" is sort of like writing a thesis on the historic accuracy of slime usage in Ghostbusters. Realistic to what? Aliens or Cowboys? How they would battle it out in the 1800's? Most don't have a point of reference to hostile space aliens, if you do, you have my sympathies and/or congratulations depending on your individual experiences being an abductee. The cowboy front seems to go well enough, some scenes you almost feel that inhaling will present you with awkward personal hygiene issues. Real enough for me. Cowboys and Aliens is indeed not an epic hyper realistic historically accurate masterpiece. It certainly relies on a few standard plot functions. It still surprised the galactic tarnation out of me as to how entertaining it was, but I kept those low expectations going in. If you do too, you might be pleasantly surprised. It's corny, of course, reference the title. It's well paced fun. This film does not appear to be going out of it's way to be more than a fun ride. It succeeds. True to an old western style to the point of leaning on clich more than a little, not to mention the weird aliens, just to be weird it seems in the vein of other hostile alien depictions, with extra appendages tucked away in the body. I enjoyed the fact the film does not take itself too seriously, clearly a bit out there in concept. One can see this being pitched to a film studio. OK, imagine for a moment...It's got cowboys...and you were going to guess? Well yeah it has them too AND...Aliens. How ridiculous. I mean the title says it all folks. I watched this twice and had as much fun the second time. If you enjoy sci-fi, westerns, or both, or just a bunch of fun and...yeah Olivia Wilde, ok what can I say, I'm a guy...watch it.",1406678400,,1937,4.553008595988539

4317829,3,B004BDOF1C,"You would believe that it would be impossible for a premise like the one in the title to fail to deliver.  Sadly, you'd be wrong.  This film, like a E3 demo, promises much more than what it actually delivers.

This film has been in development for one decade and a half before being released.  It's based on the concept for a graphic novel, which was purchased as far back as 1997.  The novel would end up being published in 2006, and in 2009 Jon Favreau, fresh from his success directing Iron Man, signed as director for the film.  Sadly, all that time in development hell didn't do wonders for the movie.

The movie stars Daniel Craig, who wakes up one morning in the middle of a field with no memory, wounded, a strange unremovable bracelet on his wrist, and the picture of a woman.  He makes his way to a near town in order to pick up clues on himself.  There he meets a preacher played by Clancy Brown, who helps him with his incomprehensible wound.  Unfortunately, that's where his luck ends, since he gets recognized as a criminal and put into prison, alongside the annoying son of the man he robbed, a gruff and brutal but well-meaning Colonel played by Harrison Ford.

The Colonel comes to the town once he hears the news and he's about to take the matter into his own hands when alien ships appear and start kidnapping people.  This forces the ones left behind to ignore hostilities and join in the search for their friends and family, particularly with the help of Craig's character, whose bracelet turns out to be a weapon that seems to be the only thing that's powerful enough to destroy the aliens, and a woman played by Olivia Wilde, who seems to know more about the subject than she lets on.

You'd think that the moment the aliens show up is when the film starts to pick up steam, but instead it's when it loses it.  The beginning is a competent, well acted and actually interesting (if not particulary original) western, but the stuff with the aliens is so generic and painfully convenient that it drags the film down.

For one, the design of the aliens is groan-inducingly derivative, and in some parts utterly ridiculous (in order to use a secondary pair of arms they need to expose their internal organs?  Does evolution work backwards in their planet?).  For a race advanced enough for interstellar travel, their lack of language or clothing of any kind is preposterous.  And, of course they're green.  I mean, I know the kind of movie we're dealing with here, but would it have killed the designers to have some creativity?

Second, the plot is excruciatingly concidence-driven.  Characters don't progress based on their skill or intelligence, but based almost exclusively on luck.  Why does Craig's character escape?  Well, for some reason they decided not to put him to sleep or restrain him while they operated on him, and they left not one but two weapons at his hand's reach.  Why is the kid able to stab the alien?  Because the alien decided to reach with his lower arms instead of the just-as-long regular ones.  Also, because he happened to have been given a knife by Ford's character a while before.

It's really a shame, because the acting is great pretty much all around.  It's specially great to see the usually-heroic Ford playing an even bigger jerk than Han Solo.  The effects are pretty good too, and I appreciate the little touches, like having the ships kidnap people by lassoing them.  The problem is that the characters are given too little to work with.  Not only the cast is too large to give proper time to everyone, but they're saddled with situations which scale up in ridiculousness.  We are supposed to feel sad at the death of a character we barely knew.  And then again later, when the character resurrects and dies AGAIN, no one seems to bat an eye.  And the aliens motivation for being here is so ridiculous it'd be at place in a Hostess Twinkies comic book ad.

I found this movie depressingly dissapointing.  I was really interested in the premise, I'm not someone who will diss a film based on a silly title or plot.  But the problem is precisely that the movie doesn't deliver on its premise.  I mean, yes, there ARE cowboys and there ARE aliens, but the premise implies much more than their mere presence.  If that was all they had, they should have made a series of trading cards instead of a film.  There's fun to be had here, but sadly, it's just too little to recommend this film.",1402963200,,4443,4.581749049429658

A few months ago i decided to purchase the DVD so we could view it again, and placed my order for the disc from Amazon. My wife, son and I settled in to watch the movie, only to have it start freezing up about a third of the way thru. I checked the disc on two other players, and sure enough, it was a dud. Filed for a return, and received another within a few days. Great. However, my son headed off to college for the spring semester, and I didn't get around to opening and playing - or attempting to play - the disc until this past weekend. Surprise - this one made it all the way to the half-way point before freezing up. Of course, I've gone past the return deadline, so I'm stuck with a defective disc.

I've always gotten good quality DVD's from Amazon in the past, so all I can surmise is that this is a bad batch of discs. That might explain the value pricing. Bad on you, Amazon, for selling defective merchandise.

By the way, we wound up streaming the entire movie thru a movie service, and the film is a hoot. Great effects, a hilarious twist on the whole cowboys-and-Indians genre, and huge fun to watch. Just don't purchase the DVD from Amazon.",1396224000,,1292,4.164

That idea is intriguing to many who believe ""they're out there"" or they might be out there, and they've been here before... just waiting for our civilization to mature, or looking for some essential resource growing scarce on their home planet.  So, we have a very unusual twist for a plot.  But they blew it in the script and the screenplay.

Why, WHY did they have to create the extra-terrestrials as the trite, super-ugly, drooling, fanged MONSTERS that walk around like fast-paced gorillas?  And why did they create their space vehicle as some ultra cumbersome looking thing that seems utterly unimaginable as something futuristic that might even fly?  That whole part of this move completely degrades the other part where some very fine actors - Craig and Harrison - likely then in need of work, do quite well.  In this day and age of almost anything possible with computer graphics and special effects, you'd think they'd create the aliens as more believable than the silly creatures they came up with.  Great to frighten young teenagers, but sadly unbecoming of what could have been done with this side of the story.

Recall the first production of ""War of the Worlds.""  There was far more sophistication there, so many years ago, on the alien side of things, than in this piece.  Enough!

 I don't recommend ""Cowboys and Aliens"" even at no cost except to watch with the kids on Halloween.  See something with Ford and Craig that's much better.  I give it three stars because I'm feeling generous.",1395705600,,1598,4.823529411764706

Cowboys and Aliens has lots of stunts and action. Graphics and scenery are top-notch. The storyline has been done numerous times before. Nothing stands out as brilliant.

After watching aliens knock cowboys off their horses three or four times, and then stab them to death with their claws, I was ready for something else, but didn't get it. The same goes for cowboys being yanked off their horses by spaceship tentacles. It ceases to entertain after a couple of stunts.

4318009,2,B004BDOF1C,"How to waste a good idea, a killer title and eight good thespians, courtesy of Jon Favreau, Damon Lindelof & others...
I found this film barely watchable, I hardly liked anything in it and I forgot most of it hours after watching it. Below, more of my impressions with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

In 1873, Arizona Territory, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert injured, with no memory and with a strange metal object on his wrist. I will say no more about the story, obviously to avoid spoilers but ALSO because there is really not so much to be said... Later he will have some adventures, during which he will meet a preacher (Clancy Brown), a mysterious woman called Ella (Olivia Wilde), a saloon owner (Sam Rockwell), an aged, powerful local cattle baron (Harrison Ford) and later also a rough and tough and yet slightly clueless bandit named Hunt (Walton Goggins), who may or may not be somebody from his past... Some Indians at one moment will be involved. And yes, as the title clearly indicates and as the trailer suggests, there will be also some aliens. Adam Beach and Keith Carradine appear also in cameos.

Now, with a minimum effort from the scenario writers (led by none else than the infamous Damon Lindelof), director (Jon Favreau) and producer (Steven Spielberg, no less!) this could have been a honest action film or at least a good comedy of western/SF persuasion. But well, Spielberg probably never even had one single look at the scenario, Damon Lindelof (the guy who wrote this ""Prometheus"" abomination) did his usual thing and the director just went with the boring and ridiculous scenario without giving a darn about the final result. Which is awful!

This is a very boring film, with poor action scenes, bad dialogs, virtually no humour, ridiculous story line and a pathetic great finale. The only reason why I give it two stars, is because of presence of some good actors, amongst which one (Harrison Ford) I like a lot and another one (Olivia Wilde) is a hot chick. Other than that there is nothing there. Avoid.",1389312000,,2053,4.745098039215686

4318048,4,B004BDOF1C,"Like many movie fans I love westerns and science fiction themes.  This is the first movie that I have seen which combines everything a western movie should have with a science fiction theme.  I saw this movie at a theater and bought it at a bargain price and viewed it again.

This western/science fiction movie had great actors Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, as well as  a good supporting cast. If you like a little mystery in a movie (At the beginning), fist fights, gun fights, Indians, good guys and bad guys fighting it out at the end, you may want to check this movie out.  In this movie the cowboys and Indians get together to fight the aliens.  Just keep your tongue firmly placed in your cheek and enjoy the action.

In conclusion, this is an action packed western/science fiction movie that has something for everyone.  One of the ways I personally rate a movie is whether or not I like watching a movie more than once.  I enjoyed watching this film just as much the second time as I did at the theater.

4318066,4,B004BDOF1C,"The strength of this science-fiction / western hybrid is its likeable minor characters, notably Preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown) and Nat Colorado (Adam Beach). The leads are all well cast, especially Olivia Wilde (Ella Swenson) who does the obligatory tough girl without being obnoxious. Chief Black Knife (Raoul Trujllo) is another great secondary character, and the Apaches are presented sympathetically, but without the fawning that abounds in most recent screen portrayals. Ford and Craig are suitably gruff and both do the Western stereotype 'man of few words' quite well. The action and effects never overwhelm the story, which is no epic but holds your interest. In summary, this is an enjoyable action/adventure for young and old with a reasonably happy ending, something increasingly rare these days.",1387238400,,808,5.472

It felt like a unique twist on an otherwise generic genre. The cast was top notch and each character was engaging and well casted but the plot is what hurts the movie the most. The plot stumbles around trying to find what path it wants to take before the final moments of the film and it finally settles where it wanted to go.

4318089,1,B004BDOF1C,"While the movie certainly deserves much higher, this rating is for the fact that the digital copy included with the Blu-ray is not of HD quality. If you buy a Blu-ray copy of a movie, you should get a blu ray equivalent digital copy for the cloud. Again another hit against the studios who keep giving their patrons crap. (And the studios wonder why people don't want to give them their money.) At least, it puts a smile on my face to know that piracy provides the studios with a tax against their needless BS.

At the end of the day, providing digital copies is a great innovation to incentivize the purchase of films, especially when you can access them in the cloud to play anywhere. But if the studios can't provide similar quality, then what's the point?",1385942400,,759,4.5

Once you're thinking in this mode, the whole thing comes together beautifully.  Daniel Craig is great as Jake Lonergan, and Harrison ford is perfect as Col. Dolarhyde.  Too, if you're patient you learn why the mysterious lady is mysterious.  It does get almost gory toward the end, but not too badly.  The ending is also a tad bittersweet, but that's all I'll say about that.  It's a very good film and I highly recommend it but, as I said, don't look at it as a pure western, because it ain't one.",1385856000,,688,4.221374045801527

Essentially (no surprise) aliens come to our planet for resources and exploring humans (in not so friendly ways - but not too graffic, so don't worry if you have kids). Any feuds or problems need to be set aside to destroy this new threat, and there are some interesting turns in the plot. It's a new take on something bordering overdone, and they did a good job.",1384819200,,495,4.276595744680851
4318117,3,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and Aliens?  Well, why not?  After all, if there are space aliens, they could just as well invade Arizona in the 19th century as Manhattan in the twenty-first.  In fact, the main interest of this film comes from using the idea that alien space invaders attach Arizona in the 1870s as a rationale for combining the two most sharply defined genres in cinema: the Western and the Invasion from Space sci-fi film.  The idea more or less works, mainly because everyone involved takes it so seriously:  if anyone cracked a smile, the whole thing would dissolve into guffaws.  The result is a watchable couple of hours of slickly produced entertainment, which combines the usual set-pieces of both genres in ways that are potentially interesting but never quite seem to engage each other.  The special effects are state of the art, but the acting is a mixed bag.  Daniel Craig is one of those actors who plays pretty much the same character in every film, and he lives up to expectation here as the desperado who escaped abduction by the aliens to play a mysterious role in battling them.  Harrison Ford as his enemy and ally has a more interesting role as the typical Western powerful rancher bad guy:  he starts off as a complete villain, but gradually develops into a more sympathetic character.  As for Olivia Wilde as the mysterious spooky female lead, well, let's just say she belongs to the ""Stand-There-And-Open-And-Close-Your-Mouth"" school of acting.

Recommended for fans of the lead actors or students of cinema genres.  Advisories: lots of not too graphic violence, some foul language, one mild semi-nude scene; the vividly slimy aliens may be frightening to younger children.  This review is based on the Universal Home Video 2011 standard Region 1 DVD, which has excellent image and sound quality; there's also a Blu-Ray edition available.",1384732800,,1854,4.957928802588997

The fast action scenes were too fast so you couldn't get a good look at the aliens and the plot, well, very weak. Anyway, it was rather boring and they tried to give it some interest with the personal relationships in the movie, but that failed. I'm also tired of watch Ford flinch. He does it in every movie he has ever been in and he just can't act. He gives the same delivery in every movie. Just change his clothes and the location. As far as the lead. They just tried to explain too many things about him through flash backs, flash sideways and flash forwards. I guess it is a movie for guys who like cowboy stuff with a little alien thrown in. It is really just a cowboy movie where they hunt the aliens instead of the indians.",1383868800,,832,4.20625

4318124,3,B004BDOF1C,"Who could resist a movie with a title like Cowboys and Aliens?  It sounds like the contents of a toy chest.  But unfortunately, the joke stops there.  While this film had plenty of room for wit, irony or satire, the cleverness never seems to go past the title, and it ends up serving all the hackneyed cliches of both western and alien attack genres straight up.  The pace sags.  You could go out for popcorn and not miss much of anything.  The lead character is a very cool cowboy, but Harrison Ford steals the show as a crusty old cattle baron, delivering acting quality more deserving of King Lear.  Other characters were appealing, but I found myself most worried about the dog.  The special effects and the aliens seemed like nothing new......the alien genre may even be more played out right now than westerns.  (An exception would be District Nine, which turns the alien genre right on it's head.)

Cowboys and Aliens isn't terrible.  It's just not that great.  I'd recommend watching this movie, but with lower expectations than the title suggests.",1383696000,2,1056,4.741758241758242

And the arms emitting from their abdomens has been done, thank you very much!  The ""space ship"" looked like a can of beans with the label peeled off and windows and doors cut out.

Of course it could have been the script that was disappointing (that's my guess).

Casting was good and the actors seemed to execute exactly what the script requested.  However, to me, the script was sort of half-hearted and did not do a good enough job of explaining much about the aliens or exploring how the people of late 1800's would react to flying vehicles and aliens.  The script seemed to be trying too hard to capture the feel of the old westerns while pulling off a sci-fi movie at the same time and it was difficult for the two to co-exist.

Probably the most interesting thing about the movie was that Clancy Brown was in it and I'd heard him voice Lex Luther in most of the DC animated T.V. series but never seen him acting in anything.  He was very smooth and comfortable in his role.  Good voice and best Lex Luther voice ever.

Actually, this a fairly decent movie all things considered.  Daniel Craig's character, Jake, wakes up all alone and not knowing who he is.  Things rapidly go from bad to worse as he heads into town and finds he is a wanted man.  Harrison Ford's character, Col Dolarhyde, has a jerk for a son who also ends up in jail at the same time.  They are do to be shipped off for justice when...OMG, alien ships show up and ""lasso"" some of the townsfolk, stealing them for who knows what diabolical purpose.

A possee is rounded up, headed by Col Dolarhyde and a reluctant Jake, who happens to have the only weapon known to bring down the bad guys, even if he doesn't know how he happened to end up with it.  Also included in the possee is a girl, a preacher, a kid, and a dog...and they later encounter outlaws and Native Americans.  There are gunfights and men and boys growing up and learning how to find their bravery in the face of terrible odds.  There is the wounded hero in Harrison Ford's character, who learns his own lessons along the way.  There is the love of gold.  There is honor and hope and hardship and a hint of humor and irony.  How much more Western can you get?

Because this IS a Western, despite the aliens.  It also shows that, when the chips are down, human beings will band together against an outside threat no matter their previous differences.

Daniel Craig does a great job in this as the stranger who has lost his way only to find it again.  Harrison Ford is even better, as the craggy old man who's seen too much death and betrayal, only to find he still has a heart of gold under it all.  The minor characters also have their own passages to undertake and it all meshes together along the way.

This is not my favorite movie, I must admit.  But its not bad.  You have to love Westerns, though...otherwise this can come across as just a sf movie with a strange twist.",1376265600,2,2134,4.349367088607595
4318268,4,B004BDOF1C,"I viewed this film as an individual and as an author of non-revisionist history related to this country's indigenous people. The presentation of two different genres of film taking place during the same century was interesting. It was refreshing to see producers and directors taking the chance of combining those two genres in film version (versus existing graphic art publications). The casting of Adam Beach and Jose Raoul Trujillo in indigenous roles were excellent decisions. I've always held Beach's acting capabilities in high regard; his casting in this film was, in fact, the primary reason I purchased the DVD. I suspect Hollywood will be reluctant to pursue more of these mixed-genres in film simply because of resistance by many earth residents to the fact that life exists concurrently in other  galaxies/spiritual realms and, probably/potentially, at a more advanced stage than our own. The choreography and digital work on this film was excellent. I cannot say the same for the bonus items on the DVD. The blatant lack of inclusion of the two leading actors in ""Indian"" roles (Beach and Trujillo) in the bonus items (interviews, promotional, etc.) was very disappointing. The actors who were included in the bonus items gave credit and commendations to themselves and other actors portraying whites ... but not to those actors portraying ""Indians.""

We have a cast full of Alpha males, snorting and stomping; mind-boggling amounts of Computer Generated blowie uppie stuff; and all the standard Western clichs.

Here is part of our cast of hundreds:
  * Harrison Ford (""Indiana Jones"" franchise) in full curmudgeon mode, is Woodrow Dolarhyde, the classic successful rancher with a bunch of ranch hands who look like henchmen, a worthless son, and most of the funny lines.
  * Daniel Craig (""James Bond"" franchise) is Jake Lonergan, a stony-faced lonesome stranger who is suffering from amnesia, an overdose of testosterone, and a checkered past. Oh...and he has this odd gizmo attached to his wrist...
  * Olivia Wilde (""House"") is Ella Swenson, our third blue-eyed lead, who plays another lonesome stranger; this gal seems to have information the rest of them need.
  * Paul Dano (""There Will be Blood"") is Percy, Dolarhyde's craven son: spoiled, impetuous and greedy. He's a showoff, too.
  * Adam Beach (""Combat Hospital"") is Cal Colorado, the half-breed who works for Dolarhyde; he always wanted to fight alongside his boss. He serves as a translator for the Native Americans who show up.
  * Keith Carradine (""The Family Tree"") is John Taggart, the besieged sheriff. His first contact with the aliens is up close and personal.
  * Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") is Doc, the peaceful bartender. His wife is one of the first abductees so he HAS to learn how to shoot a gun! Rockwell always improves the quality of a cast.

Unfortunately the long version was the complete film and worth four stars. The problem is finding the extended version. Right now it's available on Blu-Ray but I use DVDs. So I watch it on cable.

4318290,5,B004BDOF1C,"When this movie was first announced, a lot of people were expecting it to flop because of its title, because, well, it does seem dumb at first. But honestly, how better to name a movie based on its plot? But, happily, there is so much more to Cowboys & Aliens than just aliens battling Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. When a man wakes up with no memory of who he is or why he's in the small town of Absolution, with a strange metal bracelet on his wrist, he seeks out answers, only to be arrested for being the famous criminal Jake Lonergan. But, when he meets a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), things pick up speed. Col. William Dolarhyde shows up to collect Lonergan, only to be attacked by aliens, along with the rest of the town. Then, they must team together to find out what these beings want, and why some of the citizens were captured.

Directed by Jon Favreau, who brought us Iron Man, Cowboys & Aliens is an adaptation of the Platinum Comics story of the same name. Some might go into it thinking they're gonna see a mindless, action-packed thrill ride, but it actually is more character-driven and complex than that. Harrison Ford's Dolarhyde is easily his best character since Deckard from Blade Runner (after Indiana Jones and Han Solo). A man scarred by battle and death, he does what he can to keep his reputation up, and his son out of trouble, who is captured by the creatures. Daniel Craig's Lonergan is partly the classic Western hero, bearing resemblance to Eastwood's ""Man with No Name,"" but also more modern characters too. Olivia Wilde's character, Ella, is really good too, there being more to her than meets the eye. When the movie first starts, it doesn't feel like a Western/Sci-fi hybrid, but a straight-up Western for the first ten minutes. Jon's directing here definitely shows his skill, and improvement into being a great Hollywood director. The script, with five writers attached, was actually very impressive. While the third act had some of the standard fight and battle scenes any action/sci-fi blockbuster usually comes with, it does feel more satisfying than most, as the conflict is resolved without any Deus Ex Machina scenarios or clichs. Plus, the characters (as said before) are very well-written, and very likable. There are, of course, some cheesy parts and goofy moments, but what damn good blockbuster doesn't have them? The visual effects were incredible, and I have no clue why they weren't given the Oscar nomination (Hugo was nothing compared to this, even if it was a good movie). The cinematography was great, as well, showing off the Old West in a very big way, paying homage to the older westerns. Then, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams was just spectacular. It has both Western elements and great emotional investment, bringing heart and soul into the violent chaos.

In the end, Cowboys & Aliens is not for everyone, but is a well-made movie that must be seen by sci-fi, action and western fans. Even the comedy here is well-written. It's sad that this was a flop, because, if it wasn't for the stupidity of ""judging a book by its cover,"" we might have gotten a sequel because, how the movie was given to us, it was possible.

There just isn't a lot of real development of the idea beyond the ""they're here to take over, use us up,and move on"" general theme.  And halfway through, most of the mystery is gone from the backstories of various characters.

4318343,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and Aliens is a great example of a film that if it had came out during the 1990's, would have dominated the box office.  It had a star-studded cast, great special effects, an original script, respectable acting, and an original soundtrack.  However, coming out in 2011, after fans were spoiled with the POTC, LOTR, Harry Potter, and various Marvel and DC comic franchises, this movie did OK at the box office.  The movie itself is an innovative mix of science fiction and western genres, with a mix of comedy and suspense thrown in.  All of it is very authentic.  The western part of the movie is quite believable as we have both cowboys and Indians and innocent town-folk.  I especially like the portrayal of the Indians, as one of the sub-themes of the movie was the struggle of one character to find acceptance among white society, while not trying to alienate his fellow Native Americans.  The science fiction portion of the movie is standard fare; i.e. aliens coming to Earth.  However, there is one original bonus, and that is the character played by Olivia Wilde.  Being a fan of alien invasion movies, her role was new to me, and quite good in making the plot more interesting.

This package features the standard Blu-ray and DVD discs.  The package comes with both the theatrical and extended editions; hence there is no extraneous deleted or alternate scenes anywhere.  The disc also features the typical director commentary, previews of other movies, and ""making of"" extras routine for Blu-Rays nowadays.  Overall, a good buy at around $10 and an entertaining movie to boot.",1370217600,3,1593,4.855555555555555
4318344,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and Aliens is an interesting take on an old genre.  The movie is actually entertaining even if it didn't quite hit at the box office.

One reason might be that Daniel Craig (who comes across as a tough-as-boots Wild West James Bond here and is practically the same character) wasn't quite the most commercial choice for this vehicle.  In another world, it might have been Brendan Fraser, Robert Downey, The Rock or Vin Diesel.  Craig does a great job as a man in search of his past, but his hard edged Clint Eastwood with flashbacks doesn't quite cut the heroic figure we want to root for.

Neither is the show an Alien vs. Predator suspense filled green gore fest.  The aliens are passable but not scary, so that might explain how the execution didn't fly.  It either needed to be ALIEN adult themed project or a family friendly Cowboy film.  It ends up being a bit of both.  There are inconsistencies as to how to kill the alien in the show - and I won't go into spoilers here - but you will get over this as you suspend belief or not!

The concept works for the most part as an ensemble piece:  Harrison Ford finds his groove as the war-hardened Colonel and Olivia Wilde is fetching as the mysterious damsel.  Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine are ideally casted and there in the mix, but could have done much more.  A bit more circling the wagons, a Fort Alamo....hey, let's just enjoy the film.

This was definitely watchable and ok for the kids.  Part Disney, Part Bond, Part Retired Hans Solo helmed by Iron Man Director Jon Favereau.....  3.5 stars",1370217600,,1577,4.519434628975265

4318362,5,B004BDOF1C,"I avoided this film when it came out because it sounded silly.  Finally watched it and it's anything but silly. It is, in fact, a straightforward, classic Hollywood western.  It's a film that takes time getting where it's going.  It relies on characterization, and simple moral messages.  It has a basic plot structure.  The motivations of the good guys and bad guys are easy to understand, and lead to a logical climax.

If you go in expecting action-packed fare, you will likely find it slow.  If you have a longer attention span, and enjoy genre-bending material (like Firefly, for ex).. you may be pleasantly surprised by how rich and charming this film is.  That was where the film exceeded my expectations.  I liked the cast, I cared about what was going on, and was struck by how perfectly the tone of the film was maintained.  It was never too serious, but never too light.  Just right.

This is probably my favorite performance by Harrison Ford in years, and Daniel Craig is perfect as the man with no name. Clancy Brown shines as the preacher.

4318399,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys joining together with ""Indians"" and Outlaws  to combat Aliens who are mining gold...what kind of a world is that. Not bad as it turns out. Most of us would agree that although ""Indians"", as they  were back then, had a chance to make good money being killed in the movies, still, we have to move on to the ideas of this century not of the 19th. Aliens, give it a thought, who else can we vilify and kill before they kill us, except aliens. With political and economic interactions changing allies, enemies and neutrals (generally leaning one way or the other) so rapidly, in the time between starting the planning of a movie and its release, the enemy might well be a friend not to be maligned by the media.
Putting history aside, how does it work.  Pretty well. There were some constraints on the film-makers. Given Harrison Ford's long history as a Good Guy, they had to see that he didn't come off as an Evil Guy would. He is still too much of a star for that. It is also harder (I think for most of us) to see monstrous aliens in the Native West than in the Cities and urbanized areas. Just a matter of being used to that natural target of aliens over the many decades now. All in all, for me, the adjustment wasn't too difficult, although I did find it impossible to make it a complete one. If you like Westerns, and have some imagination, I should think you could enjoy this as a light, not to be taken too seriously, cowboys and 'indians' film, with some adjustment necessary.  It is probably too much to ask that anyone who grew up when the West was really the West, will really accept the transformation fully. For others, its unpredictable. Alien film devotees will not be much impressed by these specimens, in the context of the action. They should have been much more effective in combat than they were shown to be.
All in all, it is not a poor film, it is not a very good one, either. It falls into the category of unpredictable audience response. You might like it, as something you can watch for a couple of hours without having to think about what is happening, you might dislike it for not sticking to the format formed in centuries of America's love for the Western story. If it is financially painless to  see it, and if you do not want to be deeply involved in what you see, it might well work for you.",1366070400,,2329,4.369515011547344

It has great respect for Indian people. I swear the story is very well written. All of the acting was great. There were some attempts to satisfy audience urges for resolution that could have been skipped, but I enjoyed the heck out of it. It was great to be... in the west. Daniel Craig was quite perfect. There was a wee too much beautiful bodies on display but that got us through the authentic dirty cowboys. Loads of authenticity that we don't usually get... such as blood caked on to clothing and difficult to separate from wound. Elegant Indian language. Even though we know it's not a true story... it is quite believable if you have room in your brain for the existence of critters from beyond the sky. There are many little familiar notes from classic films. High quality fun. This was an HBO broadcast... but I may buy the blu-ray because I would like to share it with grandkids in ultimate-mode. I swear I never heard a word about the movie. I just saw three minutes in the middle of the film... and set my machine to record the whole thing. I can imagine that this would be a movie that would demand a director's cut. I also failed to engage my super-sound. I should have done that. My wife hates westerns but she likes science fiction. She just won't come to my westerns. When I told her about the Indian people dealing with demons of the Third Kind, she was ready to roll. She loved it.

4318425,4,B004BDOF1C,"""Cowboys and Aliens"" is one of those movies you simply have to check out just because of the title. Even more so when you find out it stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford.

Well, it isn't quite the awesomefest that the title would lead you to believe, but it is an entertaining Western-with-a-sci-fi-twist with some unexpected twists and a cast of magnificently talented actors. The aliens' reason for being on Earth is kind of flimsy, but if you can ignore that, then enjoy some energy-blasting action, creepy aliens and strong performances from ALMOST everybody.

A man (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. The only clues are a mysterious wound in his side, and a metal bracelet on his arm. After kicking bandit butt, he rides into the nearby town of Absolution and quickly gets arrested, since it turns out he's a wanted outlaw named Jake Lonergan, who's stolen gold and is suspected of murdering a prostitute.

But his imprisonment is interrupted twice -- first by the dictatorial ex-soldier, Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), and then by alien ships swooping in and kidnapping several people. Jake also discovers that his metal bracelet can fire blasts of energy that destroy one of the alien ships.

So the remaining townsfolk (plus a dog) all set out to pursue the alien ships, and get their loved ones back. But a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde) eventually reveals that she has special knowledge of these aliens -- and the key to defeating them may lie in Lonergan's blocked memories. Can a bunch of cowboys and Indians take down a spaceship of roaring green aliens?

I was expecting ""Cowboys and Aliens"" to be a tongue-in-cheek romp like the original graphic novel (which has nothing in common with the movie except... well, cowboys and aliens) or a fast-paced sci-fi flick. Well, it's actually neither -- director Jon Favreau instead makes it a Western that happens to be about cowboys vs. extraterrestrial monsters.

This is paced and filmed as a Western movie, with lots of dusty rides through the desert that Favreau uses to flesh the characters out. But he keeps things from getting dull by plopping in a bunch of alien attacks -- a particularly nice one is a dank, rainy battle in an upside-down riverboat -- before the story suddenly switches gears in the last reel, turning into a solidly explosive sci-fi finale.

The one big problem? The reason the aliens came to Earth is weak and contrived, and it doesn't explain why they keep going out of their way to kidnap humans. I guess it's... because they're evil?

But the acting is mostly pretty awesome. Daniel Craig is effectively playing an outlaw James Bond, who is almost superhumanly cool, capable and badass even with his bare hands. He's so awesome that he can beat up whiny rich brats with a single move, without even bothering to look at them. Yeah, it's not much of an acting stretch, but Craig pulls it off well.

Ford seems to be relishing getting to play a cranky, vicious old buzzard who constantly threatens and berates everyone around him, but learns a little something about the value of forgiveness. Clancy Brown is solid as a kindly preacher who serves as the film's moral center, and Sam Rockwell gives a simply magnificent, understated performance as Doc, a bartender whose wife has been kidnapped. You really feel that this guy's life is crumbling to dust, and that he's lost faith in everything.

The one true acting dud? Noah Ringer. Please, stop letting this kid act -- he's effectively a blank wall for Ford to bounce character development off of. And since Adam Beach is also in this movie to develop Ford, he's also useless.

""Cowboys and Aliens"" has some flaws, but overall it's an entertaining Western that happens to have lots of murderous aliens and excellent performances. Yee-haw!",1364083200,,3822,4.810975609756097

There was NO need for letterbox, and had I known this I would NEVER have ordered it - it was not a Lawrence of Arabia, for God's sake!
Ford and Craig must be desperate for roles.  I never like Craig as 007, can never take the place of Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, but I blame this movie's lack of good direction on the Director, and the dark recordings on Dreamworks and Universal.  After Craig was half-way acceptable in Casino and Quantum (007), he is just barely acceptable here.  And Ford, after those Marvelous Indiana Jones movies is really having to stretch here.  Both of their acting does neither any credit.  If you want a good ALIEN movie, a BELIEVABLE one, buy Alien and Aliens with Sigoourney  Weaver.  At least you can see most of those and they are beLIEVable.

4318553,4,B004BDOF1C,"PLOT SPOILER later on...

The title of this review is a joke. Reread it if you didn't notice.

""Cowboys and Aliens"" comes close to /being/ a joke. The title immediately grabs your attention -- but also suggests something shlocky from Troma. This might have been what kept audiences away.

The film itself is not at all bad. John Favreau is an old hand at this sort of thing, and his direction is sure and steady. The casting is first-rate, especially Paul Dano as Harrison Ford's wayward (that's hardly the word) son. Dano gave an exceptional performance in ""There Will Be Blood"", and will someday be a major actor.

The real problem is that, like ""The Ice Pirates"" (!!!), the storyline doesn't make sense. PLOT SPOILER Given that gold is produced by nucleosynthesis when stars explode, there's probably a lot of it in asteroids. (See the Wikipedia article on asteroid mining.) And if you insist on landing on a planet to mine gold -- why go around kidnapping natives and drawing attention to yourself? Duh.",1356652800,,1007,4.7701149425287355

Paul Dano.  Now that man doesn't walk through a part.

It is a combo of the typical wild west theme of the lone, mysterious stranger come to town with the big bad rancher and the pretty woman with a problem.  But added to that is the mysterious aliens who are snatching up people and seem to be there for an even bigger nefarious purpose.  The aliens give the other groups a reason to unite and fight.

The story is told in present time and flashbacks to explain how things got to the way they are at the opening.  I've heard this described as steampunk, but personally I wouldn't go there with it.  It's not a knock your socks off dramatic type movie and its not meant to be.  Its enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously and just sit back ready for some fun.

4318628,1,B004BDOF1C,"From the trailers, we expected Cowboys & Aliens to be something like Mars Attacks! or Men in Black - gore, but goofy stuff, and a lot of humor.  It was PG-13.  So we came with our young-ish teen.  Perhaps we misread the trailers - what we got wasn't anything like that.  We were a bit unsettled by the very beginning and she - and I - couldn't take the brutality after just a few more minutes.  Nor did we want to try to stick it out.  We went home, very upset.  The rest of our group stayed but were sorry they did - they kept expecting (hoping) it to get better.

I'm not a total wimp about movie violence - I love Total Recall (the original) and the Terminator movies.  I've seen the most recent Bond movies and thought they were well done, even when they got brutal, but the aforementioned films were nothing compared to this.  This should have been NC-17.

For comparison:  ""Whale Watcher"" was also PG-13.  It was sweet and innocuous other than some smoking and maybe a few curse words.

After a skirmish with some thugs he wades into a town under the rule of a land baron(Ford)and his cronies. Craig gains town's respect after beating up Ford's son but is arrested by an honest sheriff who wants to keep him for Federal Marshalls. Ford has other plans, we learn Craig stiffed him on a gold robbery and Ford wants revenge. After losing a good portion of his cattle after a mysterious phenomenon involving,'strange lights' and learning his son has also been arrested, Ford moves in. During a standoff between him and the law, other visitors ride...no, fly into town for their own say on matters.

Interesting premise delivers the goods with slam bang gritty action early on and special effects rightfully left in the background with some fresh surprises and stunts. An excellent cast with Craig, Ford, and even Olivia Wilde are eventually more than fun to watch(although Ford's sometimes over the top western drawl/girth doesn't help for some less camp that this film could have used). We can see the star cast tried and mostly succeeds with real effort from the writers with characters and plot which doesn't hurt, but still beg for more.

The supporting cast is good and deserved more play than they get, but at over two hours, perhaps less is more. The same can't be said for some clear over indulgences from the CGI department earlier than necessary with the alien creatures. This should have been saved or lessened with some clever writing and only pits the film drawing too many artificial comparisons with Alien or District 9 which hurts its potential. It really can't decide whether it wishes to be a campy sci-fi/action/western/horror/mystery or much more, yet still has good moments but with some elements that are interesting but then forgotten(that steamboat in the middle of the desert was cool and begs questions that are never resolved or played with later in the story). The gold mining plot has potential and draws some cool imagery and possibility for the finale that goes all out for action and thrills with some emotion.

An interstellar conflict point is alluded to and gives for a decent twist with the Wilde character before the final act. But lets face it, we knew there was something with her when we saw her walk naked amongst shocked but not excited cowboys in the trailer. By this point you chuck away your eyes for originality and hope for a good finale, which the film provides without too much reach for a happy ending that I feared for Craig's character.

Parting thought, the film was not the stinker many have said, but could have been better with less screenwriters and an extra script doctor or two. Steven Spielberg Executive-Produced with director Jon Favreau(oh yeah, look for an almost Hitchock-esque cameo early on)gives what he has, which if you like his films is usually enough, both for casual viewers and the obvious CGI nuts, though even they may feel cheated.

Bottom line, it could have been worse under lesser hands, but better with what they had. Is that the attitude to have following a good romp? Oh well, a solid three and a half on a good day but with an extra half for drawing out the Script-doc in me, as I said, with some clever extras it didn't have to be CGI fest-which it really isn't save for some eye rollers- but that's my opinion.

4318638,4,B004BDOF1C,For what is essentially a 'B' movie..I thought it was pretty good. The actors carried the day more than the story. Delivery was timely and the disc was in great condition,1348876800,,170,4.516129032258065
4318639,3,B004BDOF1C,"A man wakes up in the deserts of Arizona with no memories of who he is. He has a funny gizmo wrapped around his wrist. Three guys ride up and assume he's wanted for a bounty, so they try to take him. He beats and kills them all, takes some guns and better clothes, and heads into town. In the town of Absolution, he is patched up by the local preacher (who also packs a rifle). The preacher gives the amnesiac some advice: The good Lord don't care about what you did in the past, it's what you do now that's important. The man winds up in a confrontation with the son of the local cattle baron which lands both of them in jail. Before the sheriff can take them to the U.S. Marshall, the town is attacked at night by strange lights from the sky--ships that capture a bunch of the locals, including the cattle baron's son. Luckily, the gizmo activates when the alien ships arrive and the man shoots one ship out of the sky with it (regular bullets do nothing). The pilot escapes, leaving a trail of inhuman footprints for the posse to follow.

The movie has great production values. Southwest America looks great and the aliens are seamlessly integrated into the visuals, making the movie a treat for the eyes. The aliens are a bit of a PG-version of the alien from the Alien franchise, though they are scary enough for this film. The one misstep production-wise was an explosion that looked a little too much like the space shuttle Challenger exploding. It was a bit of a shock though it must be unintentional.

The tone of the movie was a bit off for me. I expected a movie with the title ""Cowboys & Aliens"" to have a lighter, more comic tone. There are funny lines and occasional humorous moments, but mostly it's played as a straight drama. That'd be okay but I didn't find the back stories of the amnesiac or the cattle baron very interesting or their characters sympathetic. Rooting for them was a little hard since I didn't care that much, even though they were played well enough by Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. The theme of redemption is touched on throughout the film but I did not find it very convincing at the end.

Maybe the problem is the genre-mash-up aspect of the film. The high water mark for genre-mash-up has to be Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which combines a period drama with a kung fu flick with a romance with a mystery. The big difference between Crouching Tiger and Cowboys is the starting point. Crouching Tiger starts with a great story that spills over into all these other genres, like a rosebud unfurling its petals. Cowboys seems like a bunch of people took all these cool petals and tried to put a flower together. The credits show seven different writers and seventeen producers, co-producers, and executive producers. The compelling, central story just isn't there or it got lost in a long line of people trying to shape it just right. A lot of neat ideas are in the film but they don't quite make a cohesive whole.

Cowboys is entertaining enough for a rainy day. If I ran across it while channel surfing I might watch a bit but it wouldn't keep me on the channel.",1347667200,2,3106,4.4920353982300885

I was looking for a mindless but fun movie to watch in order to wind down after a long trip and Cowboys & Aliens accomplished that beyond my expectations. If you're looking for a Star Wars type of epic movie this isn't it. It's an off-the-wall movie mixing the typical Wild West plot of the rich town bully who's always battling the out-manned sheriff with the typical Sci-Fi plot of technologically impaired earthlings battling technologically superior (and ugly) aliens. There are some interesting little subplots like Harrison Ford's character, a battle hardened former Colonel and rich cattleman dealing with a disappointing son; and Noah Ringer's character, a young boy struggling with a tentative but growing bravery. Along with the more serious subplots is a clever type of humor that makes you laugh and melds the serious with the silly. Good writing, good acting, and good special effects are what make it all work.

4318650,3,B004BDOF1C,"Scott Mitchell Rosenberg first devised this silly story as a comic book aka graphic novel - and it should have stayed in that format.  It is worrisome to note in the credits that the screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk: six cooks in one kitchen do not a successful meal create.  So we know from the start that this is a joke and as a joke it becomes entertaining in parts and just plain silly in others - sort of like a comic book...

The `story' unfolds when a spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world. A stranger (Daniel Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been (excerpted from the package insert).

Aside from Daniel Craig (still buff) and Harrison Ford (long in the tooth) the cast includes a lot of mechanical gooey multihanded and body compartmented aliens (identities withheld), Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Abigal Spencer, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and a lot of other one-liner actors. It is all rather silly and over the top, but then that is the popular concept in epic films these days. You pays your money and you takes your choice.

Olivia Wilde is ... well, Wilde. A rare beauty that can act.

Craig is believable as a western hero, no English accent ... they guy can act with the best of them.

Ford is OK as the gruff old geezer ... how many more action flicks can he make ... he'll be in a walker soon.

The alien critters were suitably nasty, but familiar. It must be tough to come up with aliens that are fresh and new ... these guys looked made up from some bits from the original alien, some frog parts, and a smidgen of Ninja Turtles on LSD.

4318656,4,B004BDOF1C,"Admit it SciFI fans. If you have not seen this movie yet, it is because you have been laughing at the truly funny title and the silliness of the implied premise.

Cowboys and Aliens is why the term mindless entertainment exists. Mindless perhaps, entertaining certainly.

Amazon suggests a plot synopsis:
Plot? We don need no Stinking Plot! Yes there is one, but does it really matter? We got Cowboys (and Indians) and BEMs (Bug-Eyed Monsters). You are free to bet on the winner. If it helps not all the cowboys are good guys. Also consider that betting against the side that has both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig (somewhere in there is also Keith Carradine) - is at your risk.

There are a number of plot devices from movies like Firefly, War of the Worlds (newer version), Independence day and, on the western side: the Spaghetti Westerns and ... well let me suggest that: if you are the son of a rich wild west daddy and assume he will get you out of jail for shooting up the town, better to have an angry grizzled Harrison Ford than Walter Brennan. Because eatin teeth or no, that plot device was old before the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Support-Your-Local-Sheriff/dp/B000056H2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Support Your Local Sheriff</a>&nbsp;1969, made it funny.

On the other hand if you can stare in to the face of an angry grizzled Harrison Ford and remember your next line then you are as fine a child star as Noah Andrew Ringer. Then again, if you can face an angry H. Ford than you too can put a Tennessee toothpick where it can best adjust the attitude of an over - reaching BEM.

Daniel Craig may not have the over defined features of a young Schwarzenegger or Steven Seagal but he has a great 50 yard stare and all the moves. Do not hack him off unless you have 30 guns pointed as his girl.

A few other bits of advice. Maybe if Col. Dolarhyde (Ford) had abetter attitude towards West Pointers, he would not have lost so many troops at Antietam. As is his final deployment against the aliens stank. If the super high tech alien race had a few more hand guns they would have eaten your men alive..Literally!

As for the Aliens, if you are planning a rematch - you may want to think about why it is that in the alien abduction biz, the anal probe is,  industry standard.

Yet, this movie works. Unlikely elements seems to come together. The logic fails are no more glaring than many another SciFI movie. What lifts this move above most others is the originality in use of so many used parts and more than enough acting to make it sum out to an entertaining way to enjoy your popcorn.",1344297600,2,2651,4.683870967741935

You will be amazed at how absurdly ridiculous the characters and the dialogue are. I mean there must have been competition amongst the writers once they saw this turkey was beyond hope.

You are faced with choosing amongst so-so reviews or all out negative like this. I am tempted to say anyone writing a positive review on this movie is a paid flack, a shill, but maybe it is just irrationaly loyal Ford fans. Check the histories of the positive reviews before you buy.

4318659,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and Aliens brings out an original concept and although is based on the comic book/graphic novel of the same name, is nearly a complete story in and of itself.

The film starts out as a standard cowboy film; drunk, irresponsible son of a cattle baron screwing around with the locals since he feels his dad's name will protect him.  Part of the gang includes an American Indian whose later history is revealed and is quite touching.  But I am getting ahead of myself.

It's night and just when you think you are going to watch another Western drama, the aliens come.  Their ships are sleek and fast.  They whip out these hooks and kidnap people off their horses, the street, stores, etc.  You really feel the passion, the fear and excitement as they come zooming in!

Of course 19th century peoples have little concept of these so they are dumbstruck.  The plot rolls on like this, with an amnesiac cowboy and a strange weapon on his wrist; a cattle baron who has second thoughts about absolute power; and a woman from a strange planet, herself a victim of the alien hordes upon her own world.

Harrison Ford is great as the crotchety old cattle baron, whose backstory is filled with tales of how to be a man and how his sympathy for those less powerful than himself changes the viewer's opinion of him.

Daniel Craig plays Jake the amnesiac; barely escaped from the last alien culling, can't remember it and only knows that he must ride on.  But can he?

And the third person, the woman from another world in human form who wants to help these 19th century men and women to avoid the fate that her world suffered from.  Great acting!

Best Scene:  When the Cowboys & Indians fight the fast-moving aliens, it's really a site to behold.  Guns, arrows and laser explosions for a good 15 minutes of fanboy overload.

Bottom Line:  The film plods along at times, and a plot hole or two prevent this one from making it five stars.  Still, loved the action, you care about the characters and really sympathize with Jake, a man out of his league but adapts to what is really needed of him.  The Spielberg touch with the turtle-like aliens, their delicate hands and fierce demeanor, really put in some frightful appearances.

The DVD's special features including several Making Of's, how the aliens were formed, the creation of the aliens, some exclusive interviews with director Favereau, Spielberg and a few of the main actors.  Great product.

Recommended.

* Daniel Craig as Jake Lonergan, an amnesiac outlaw

4318660,4,B004BDOF1C,"The film is called ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and that's exactly what you get.  It carries a bit more serious tone than you'd think given such a title but at its core, its a solid comic-book style storyline.  I read some reviews saying it was slow and badly acted.  I disagree on both counts.  The pace moved well and the the acting was fine.  Harrison Ford comes through strong and the rest are acceptable.  it isn't academy award acting but again, its ""Cowboys and Aliens"".  Some reviews here have slammed the story.  Its a decent story that makes you care about the characters.  Nowhere do you have a ""give me a break"" moment and the tale draws you into the more fantastic elements slowly enough that the developments seem natural enough.

The Western sets were exceptional.  The aliens acceptable (not great but not bad either).  The action was good and strong enough that except for one point in the film, it didn't have the video game feel that is so common in action films that rely on computer graphics.

The bad points of the film are that a few of the plot twists are a bit too convenient.  If you view this as something other than a comic book storyline, you'll be scratching your head.  If you recognize it for what it is, you'll enjoy a good, fun film.

I wish they made more movies like this.",1343520000,,1300,4.444915254237288

The plot is almost believable in the way it's presented. I don't want to reveal too much but these are really bad ass aliens and I cheered [inside] every time one of them got blown away. I gave the film 3 stars because it's a simple movie with good acting and production value but there are more than a few holes in the story.

Compare to many movies with other aliens where they appear not clearly enough or just one to few times, in this movie you will take a very good look at them and they will appear often. As much as the title can sound hilarious at first, I regret thinking bad about it. It's a very nice entertaining movie that is not just all about action. It will keep you thinking.

Based upon the book by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg.
  It is 1873. A man, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), wakes up and finds himself in the middle of a nowhere desert in Arizona Territory. All he sees around him is a picture of a woman and a rock. He is wearing a wristband contraption. He tries to use the rock to get it off his wrist. Three horsemen come up to him and order him to start walking into town. He takes all three of them down.
 Well now, he has new clothes, a hat, a gun and a horse to ride into town and a dog wagging his tail.
 Not everyone is friendly with him. He is a stranger in these parts and like every western, he has to fight and prove how much of a cowboy he is.
  He finds out he is a ""Wanted"" man. Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) comes into town to help his son, Percy (Paul Dano). By the way, Woodrow doesn't like being called a ""Colonel"". Suddenly, something appears in the dark sky. Jake's wristband thing begins to light up. Lights of something are flying low coming into the center of the town. It's alien space ships.

 Also in the cast: Olivia Wilde, Adam Beach, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Noah Ringer.

 Option of language and subtitles: English, Spanish, French. DVS Descriptive Video Service.

 Bonus Features: Finding The Story. Outer Space Icon. The Scope of the Spectacle. Audio Commentary with Director Jon Favreau.

 Well, this movie did not help with George Lucas getting Indiana Jones 5 into full writing speed, but at least we have a new James Bond movie, SKYFALL, to be released November 9, 2012.

4318680,4,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys and aliens(released July/11)is,to me,a surprisingly good Sci-Fi film. It's reviews were not the greatest and I was anticipating watching a high budget movie with good intentions that went no where fast. But such was not the case,which leads me to mention the first rule of reviewing:Don't believe what others see and write about,believe only what YOU see! Mr. Spielberg had a hand in this epic,which truly IS one,in feel and looks. The cinematography is fabulous as we are taken all over the beautiful outlands of Arizona. But let's not get ahead of ourselves,let's look at the films storyline.
The film begins out in the desert near a town called Absolution. A man(Daniel Craig) wakes up on the desert floor with a wound in his side and no idea how he got there. On his left wrist is an over sized ""bracelet"" of some type,origin unknown. Some drifters come through and decide he may be a wanted man. Before they can take him into town for the reward the man takes down all three and wanders alone into Absolution.
While there it seems some of the townsfolk know him,specifically the sheriff. It seems this stranger is a wanted felon by the name of Jake Lonergan. After the son of a local prominent cattle rancher,Mr. Dollarhyde(Harrison Ford),accidentally shoots a deputy sheriff,both are taken into custody and put into a wagon for shipment to and a trial at Tuscon. Before they can leave Dollarhyde shows up for his boy but is interrupted by a group of strange lights approaching the town. The lights turn out to be alien craft intent on abducting some of the townspeople. Lonergan's bracelet comes to ""life"" and he is soon shooting at and downing at least one of the ships. However the alien pilot escapes and roams into town only to be shot and wounded.
Lonergan leaves town while Dollarhyde forms a posse which heads out at first light to track down the creature. Lonnergan arrives at a cabin in which he gets flashbacks. He has had them previously but they grow more detailed and this one reveals his former love and some gold he brought home.in the flashback the gold suddenly melts on the table and is sucked upwards while his lady love gets pulled right out of the cabin.
Lonnergan leaves the cabin and joins up with Dollarhyde and his men. A ways out they run into a gang of robbers that turn out to be Lonnergan's old gang members. They take him to their camp and a confrontation occurs between Lonnergan and the new boss. It doesn't go down well for Lonnergan who eventually has to use to bracelet to help them all escape. Traveling further on the party gets captured by some Apache Indians. Through some harrowing moments a consensus is finally reached between the two groups to fight the invaders. Through more concise flashbacks Lonnergan now knows and leads them all to the place where the alien mother ship is buried.
A pitched battle between the aliens and Lonnergan,Dollarhyde and company begins. Entry is gained into the ship and eventually many of the taken settlers are found and released. Near the end the ship lifts off but is finally destroyed only about a thousand or so feet above the ground. Back in Absolution Lonnergan is asked to stay on by Dollarhyde while the sheriff pretends Lonnergan had died in the firefight. Lonnergan begs off both and leaves town. Fade out in typical western fashion.
As I mentioned before this film simply looks beautiful. The scenes in the desert are stunning and epic in their look. Something out of a John Ford film. The script has just enough twists and turns in it to keep one interested throughout its journey on the screen. Lonnergan's flashbacks(a tool as old as Pete the Pup)is done just right,I find. The acting is also spot on as we have a great cast of starring and supporting actors on hand. The special effects are also of the highest quality as the aliens are all too real looking. They are bipeds,whose smallish heads meld into their necks,and whose chests open up to reveal two hands,with three E.T. like digits. The fight sequences between humans and aliens are also very realistic and deadly looking. These things aren't on Earth for a game of backgammon.
Technically speaking the film looks great in its original a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include three featurettes and commentary by the director.
All in all a very enjoyable blend of the old fashioned western with a Sci-Fi backdrop. It has an epic feel and look to it and the acting along with the special effects are very good. Recommended.",1339891200,,4475,4.723785166240409

I bought a copy myself......had to. I just hope that someone can come up with enough money to pay both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig to make a sequel. I would be the first person to pre-order it AFTER seeing it at the theater.

4318698,3,B004BDOF1C,"What do you get when you have both Indiana Jones and James Bond fighting nasty space aliens? Surprisingly, not much. It's a lukewarm effort, COWBOYS & ALIENS, a sci-fi horse opera that kicks its intriguing premise to the curb. Jon Favreau, dude... Que paso hombre?

Is it that too many cooks are in this kitchen? The script, treated like a frisbee, was tossed around amongst Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and there's always worry when you have that many script wranglers in the mix. It surely did not help that the eventually better-reviewed (yet lesser budgeted) ATTACK THE BLOCK debuted at the box office on the same day, never mind that COWBOYS & ALIENS, going into it, had garnered more fanfare.

Props to Daniel Craig for a really good performance, and with a bang-on American accent, to boot. He brings to the table his patented coiled physicality and a certain quiet swagger that lends itself well to the oater genre. And, as usual, he's not exactly a fount of blabbety-blab. Dude is stoic. He plays a scruffed-up stranger who gallops into the dusty desert town of Absolution, New Mexico. The man has no memory of his past and he's got this odd metal shackle circling his wrist. From his waking up in the desert to the run-in with some rough hooligans to his arrival in Absolution, it's all good. Those scenes had me anticipating a good time at the movies.

And then the other cast members shuffle in, and the central casting department must be empty as heck, because all the stock characters have surfaced onscreen here. There's the gun-toting preacher (Clancy Brown) and the sort of wimpy doctor (Sam Rockwell) whose wife insists that he has nothing to prove (meaning that he does) and the little boy who you keep expecting, at any moment, to yell out ""Shane! Come back!"" Olivia Wilde brings the sexy but elicits endless bemused expressions from me, and, worse, she doesn't even get buck nekkid as may have been hinted in certain promos. She plays a mysterious gal named Ella who claims to know something about the brusque stranger with the lunky metal bracelet. She strolls with a gun belt on, so we realize that she's far from a damsel in distress. Until later on, when she becomes a damsel in distress. There's a reveal about her which, again, bemused expression.

There's half a mo when I thought Harrison Ford's character, awesomely, would be a straight-out villain. That would've been an interesting twist for Ford. But, it turns out, his despotic Colonel Dolarhyde is merely misunderstood, that it only required a scared little boy to soften him up. I really expected something grander from this big name ensemble, instead of this pedestrian outcome.

The grizzled town sheriff (Keith Carradine) learns that it takes more than a mere ""Reach for the sky, mister!"" to cow the stranger who had just braced and bruised the bullying son of the town's principal benefactor, who happens to be influential cattle baron, Colonel Dolarhyde. And since the Colonel's son had just shot up a sheriff's deputy, he also sees the guts of a jail cell. But, look, here comes the ruthless Colonel Dolarhyde, bent on springing his wastrel offspring. So far, the plot is unfolding in generic western form.

But before things could go full-on RIO BRAVO, alien vessels streak out of the sky and begin raining destruction onto Absolution, a town that just got even more dusty. Grappling harnessy hook-thingees project out of these vessels and ensnare random townspeople, and this may be when the film achieves its most electrifying moment, as these caught victims rapidly dwindle into these tiny dots in the sky, all flown away. This is around when the stranger realizes what his wrist shackle is truly capable of. I wish then that the film had focused more on the reactions of loss from those left behind. ""Doc"" is the most visibly affected, his wife one of those abducted. The rest seem all gung-ho to form a rescue posse, bypassing any modicum of devastated grief. I understand that you have to keep things moving, but the result is that I wasn't as invested in these characters. Because if they don't give a what, then why should I?

COWBOYS & ALIENS does have some spiffy action sequences, the highlight of which is the big showdown between the search party - composed of cowboys, Apaches, and badmen - and the savage aliens. But clogging up chunks of the narrative are these long-winded, lethargic moments. I just can't get past the clunkiness. Not to mention, the big bad aliens themselves may look good but their motivation is strictly by-the-numbers stuff. Not counting Daniel Craig, the performances of the cast members (even Harrison Ford) come off as rote. The western stereotypes pile up, and not even the sci-fi injection can ultimately bump it up. So, I say, check this out when it's on cable because what Daniel Craig does here is worth watching. But what I really recommend is the graphic novel this film was based on. And, also, ATTACK THE BLOCK, if you're hankering for a more spirited and creative sci-fi thriller.",1337299200,2,5068,4.818390804597701

Since the movie is not a great Western nor a great sci-fy movie, it is a relatively weak movie.  The movie tries to focus too much on too many things thus neither one aspect is very strong.  For westerns there is Silverado, Tombstone, Outlaw Josie Wales, or Shane and for Sci-fy there are movies like War of the Worlds, Independence Day, Star Treks (excluding the new one), Alien series, Close Encounters of the Third kind.  While I applaud Hollywood trying to do something completely new and different than ever attempted, but hopefully this will be the last time to merge these diametrically opposed movies again.  Either focus on either a Sci-fy movie or Western movie with a good story.",1336867200,3,788,4.764705882352941
4318702,3,B004BDOF1C,"Jon Favreau's ""Cowboys and Aliens"" looks great, sounds great, and offers one of the best trailers around.  Indeed, for the first fifteen minutes, ""C&A"" is a pure delight.

But then the movie starts to reek of production notes and ""suggestions"" from the money that halt the movie more or less in its tracks, and the result is some fun, innocuous PG-13 pablum.

First, the good.  Daniel Craig starts the movie as an anti-hero suffering from amnesia - it's clear he's a rough hombre, but he's also got some bizarre metallic bracelet clamped to his arm that foreshadows the titular aliens.  But this is the Old West, so Craig (whom we eventually learn is arch-gunslinger Jake Lonergan) has absolutely no appreciation for science fiction.  He moves onward.

His path seems destined to cross with Harrison Ford, as the dastardly cattle baron Colonel Dolarhyde runs this part of the Old West.  Dolarhyde rules his realm without patience or mercy, and while he'll break his son out of jail (even though the loser belongs there), his son knows that dear old Dad's punishment will be worse than the jail.

Just when these two alpha males cross swords, the aliens show up - fantastically.  The aliens fly into town and lasso half the locals in a wonderful set piece.  This sets up the big plot, which involves Dolarhyde and Lonergan leading a motley bunch of pistoleros against the aliens to get their people back.

And once we're in pursuit of the aliens, the movie falls apart.  Dolarhyde, it turns out, isn't a great villain, but actually a soft-hearted guy who's just seen too many bad things.  Lonergan is all too willing to leave his bandit days behind.  And soon we're uniting the Law, train robbers, and Apaches in a multicultural raid against the alien stronghold.  All the menace and tension from the first fifteen minutes of the movie - when anyone could kill anyone at any time for less than no reason - has seeped out of the movie, leaving a limp balloon in its place.

Fantastic special effects - just as good as anything Favreau did for ""Ironman"" - can't quite elevate the movie enough.  While not a bad movie, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" fails to reach its promise - perhaps if Favreau had cast a bunch of no-name actors instead of Hollywood royalty the movie wouldn't have cost $160 million to make, and then he could have made a great movie of daring and danger.

4318712,4,B004BDOF1C,"The concept of merging two genres is enough to carry the day. The typical Western, complete with nasty cattle rancher lording it over a hard-scrabble town and a host of time-worn characters, is melded with an alien invasion, whose aliens look and act a lot like the ones made famous in Sigourney Weaver's epic Alien trilogy. The aliens do typical alien things, like capturing humans and experimenting on them, and the alien spaceship is typically ill-lit with dripping moisture. Apparently aliens see well in the dark but have few plumbing skills. No problem. From my point of view, it is precisely the collection of these familiar characters, characteristics, and dialogue that make the movie so much fun. One minute the spoiled son of the mean rancher is drunkenly shooting up the dusty main street...the next minute, an amnesiac man with a peculiar wristband is shooting up a mini-spaceship which has lasso'ed and carried off a host of townsfolk. One woman in town seems to know more than she should about the matter. I simply enjoyed the whole film. I loved seeing a very experienced cast (including Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Clancy Brown) spouting lines that could have come from any cowboy movie from the past half century. I loved seeing a band of Indians killing aliens with spears, and I really got a kick out of the mysterious woman speaking fluent Chiricahua to the chief of the Indians.

But fast paced action with frequent brief interludes of human interest holds this plot together very well. As to the story line, think ""Independence Day"" set in the Old West, only the good guys ride fast horses rather than fast F-18's. And it is necessary to introduce a ""good"" alien into the story so the viewer will come to understand what the ""bad"" aliens' motivation is - but even that gimmick works out well, except for the brief nude scene by the campfire which appeared to be gratuitous sex for the sake of gratuitous sex, although the movie's PG-13 rating demanded only discrete shots of alien buttocks.

The actors and director make this movie work if you're looking for an exciting drama which is far-fetched without seeming to be all that far-fetched.

So, don't expect some drippy, overly emotional scenes which provide a convenient intermission to visit the restroom or fetch a soda from the fridge - this movie had none I could detect. The plot synopsis included by Amazon above provides the necessary story details but you'll enjoy the acting, you'll admire the way the outlandish parts come seamlessly together and how very professionally the director handled the hero's amnesia, usually a plot device which is over dramatized in more critically acclaimed films.

The opening scene - with its unexpected burst of violence and intriguing wrist-wear for Daniel Craig - promised a lot but after that it quickly becomes a by-the-numbers action movie: episodic, clichd and derivative. It's obvious that the barman who can't shoot, for example, is going to save the day with some crack gun-play later on in the movie. Another major criticism is that I found it totally unexciting. I just sat there yawning and checking the clock.

Which is a shame because not only does it have a great cast but there are also some flashes of intrigue and originality - such as the upside down steamer five hundred miles away from the nearest big river. More could have been done with the clash of subject matter too, the most obvious angle being the comparison of frontier life in the West with aliens pushing their own frontiers of exploration.

Before you can say 1784, the handcuff beeps a Decidedly 21st string of beeps, and the handcuff transforms into an alien ship destroying weapon!

i like daniel craig as an actor (layer cake, casino royale, arch angel), and liked his portrayal of a no nonsense Clint Eastwood meets James bond character a lot during the first half of the movie. The movie also has amazing cinematography and locales going for it in the first half. Then all goes to hell (in an utterly non-entertainingly bad way) when they try to assemble any thing resembling a plot or storyline. It seems as though the creative geniuses asked themselves : what would it *look* like if aliens landed when the cowboys were settling the west and starting the gold rush. They however seem to have forgotten to really think through ""what would happen"" and ""why"", or maybe some focus group decided for them and told them that wasn't important.

The result is a visually stunning piece of art that stinks like a rotten fart. There is nary a story, nor a plot. The actors are wasted, the action mind bogglingly stilted, and the dialog is trash. There are plot ""wtf""s that are really difficult to look past even for a die hard Steven Segal or Van Damme fan. E.g. Wtf would aliens, with decidedly superior tech, fight hand to hand with humans, even as they were being gutted down with their own amazingly destructive blast weapon? Surely they had the fore thought to bring more than one of those.

4318758,4,B004BDOF1C,"****Minor spoilers:  I do warn you before I give them****

The idea of old west meets advanced alien life forms is a refreshing change of pace. Don't watch this film expecting an intellectual story (IE like Independence Day).  It's just an entertaining ""what if"" sort of film and it is very well done.

May I add: ""Mr. Ford, you've still got it after all these years!""  One scene was an obvious nod to Indiana Jones (you'll know it when you see it, film watchers).

This film would have gotten a 5 star rating from me, but there were a few things that really bothered me. ****minor spoilers below****

Emma is a glaring example of a ""plot device!""  Yes, it made for an interesting twist but after her campfire debut, she goes back to well... ordinary.  I'd have liked to see her prove herself to be more extraordinary. (Sorry, I know this is vague, but I am trying not to give away too much).

I know this film is supposed to make you feel like you're watching an old western with a twist, but making the Native Americans hooting, hollering ""kill the white man before you know if he is after your common enemy"" type people is just irritating.  I don't expect a love fest between the cowboys and the Native people, but I wish the writers would have toned down the war-crying!  At least they didn't make the chief blame evil spirits. Instead he blames an earth bound, more plausible enemy - the gold hungry settlers.

One of the last aliens we see die does meet an end that is rather fitting. Poetic Justice! Yes, I cheered.

Cowboys and Aliens does deliver something else many will appreciate:  very little foul language and NO explicit sexual scenes. Yes, there is one flashback of Jake and his (wife?) having a tumble in the grass, but they are fully clothed.  The only other scene is a brief glimpse of Emma nude, but you only see her from behind. These are  two things I definitely appreciated.  The film is a little gory though it is mainly green alien blood and there is the occasional violence befitting a western.

This is a decent family film if you have older children that don't scare easily.  I think younger viewers might have issues with it, but as with any film pre-screening never hurts.",1329264000,,2202,4.512626262626263
4318759,4,B004BDOF1C,"The movie itself was entertaining to watch. There were a few plot surprises but for the most part
it was pretty predictable. It was awesome to see cowboys and aliens in the same movie. The
movie focuses more on the cowboys and brings it down to earth with their individual human
stories. The characters were all believable. The aliens were pretty much just faceless bad guys.
They're just bad, there's really not much more to their characters. But that didn't matter too much
because we were watching humans either searching for redemption, changing their ways, or
becoming men.

The video was perfect looking. The scenery in this movie was beautiful. It had a lot more foliage
than other westerns that are pretty much out in the total wasteland desert. The surround sound
was extremely active and powerful. It was fun to listen to things happening in all the different
speakers.

The special features so far are really interesting. The interviews with Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford,
Spielberg, Olivia Wilde etc. were much longer than I thought they'd be. They are definitely not
the fluff internet interviews that tell you nothing.

Overall the movie was entertaining, but not amazing. I think I'm still coming to terms with how I
feel about the ending. It looks and sounds great on Blu-ray.

What a piece of crap! Hollywood wants me to accept that there aliens in the old west, but at the same time wants me to take the concept, story, and characters very seriously like it's some important piece of film. Where's the humor? Where's the narrative drive? Why are there so many pointless characters? Why does the movie grind to a lifeless halt every 15 minutes? Has Daniel Craig ever been more boring? Why isn't he freaking out about everything that's happening to him? Why spend half an hour setting up a bunch of characters and relationships only to have them disappear for the rest of the movie? Why waste Paul Dano like that after he creates the most interesting character in the film? Why is there a dog in the movie? Why is there a stupid little kid in the movie? Why is everyone so ridiculously macho? Where's the awe and wonder at the discovery of things never before known to man? What does the theme of people accepting each other for their differences have anything to do with anything else happening in this film? Why does Favreau's direction defeat the humor and character in every scene? Why are the action scenes so dreadfully boring? Where's the setup and payoff of anything? Why are the aliens so stupid, and what do they have to do with anything? If the aliens want to capture us for research, then why are they killing everyone? Why do the aliens want gold, and why don't they just go get it from some bank vault? Why is there a ship in the desert just like in ""Close Encounters?"" Why does the alien's holding pen look exactly like the one in ""Super 8?""  Why hasn't Harrison Ford made a good movie since ""The Fugitive?"" But most importantly, WHY ISN'T THERE ANYTHING FUN happening in this movie so we can enjoy ourselves? What's the point of making this movie if the audience can't go along for the ride? It's just one cliche meeting another cliche and making a duller cliche. The only people that seem to like it are the ones that are happy to just see anything resembling a western.

4318779,4,B004BDOF1C,"The worst thing about this movie turned out to be the title.  When I first heard of it, I hated it.

I'm not a fan of CGI, simply because 90% of it is cartoony and unconvicing to say the least.  This movie has its share, and some is decent, and the rest is baloony and exaggerated in terms of realism.  It seems as if they could get that right by now.  It's one reason why even though I have a 3-D capable 65"" TV, there has never been anything, including Avatar that I wanted to watch on it, although Avatar has some decent effects, I can't stand the grunt-millitary babble.

The story turned out to be far more interesting and complex than I expected and the character development was good, overall.  The little kid made no sense.  Why do they insert little kids for no good reason where they are totally out of place!

It actually parallels one of the more interesting ancient alien theories, in terms of another civilization using the inhabitants of Earth to mine gold.  The actual theory involves humans reengineered in paleolithic times into their current form with the specific purpose of supplying an alien society.  They were taught at least, higher mathmatics and engineering, which enabled them to build the wonders of the ancient world.  Remember, human cranial capacity has tripled in far less time than evolution would usually account for, and there is no good explanation for that fact.  The theory continues that what was given was taken away, or that humans simply devolved after they left, over the period of about 2,000 years, sinking into a mire of religious dogma and warring over silly causes and greed...a pattern that continues.  Remember, this isn't my theory.

Anyway, the movie deserves a better title, and would have been more appealing with a name that didn't call to mind some silly 1950s B-Grade Sci-Fi excuse for entertainment.  This was no Plan 9 From Outer Space, although it certainly wasn't Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, Contact or even Mars Attacks.  It was still a good, well-acted movie.

In any event this is a fun movie full of actions, surprises, romance, and gold. There is a lot of talent involved and a chance to notice one again how Harrison Ford can easily slip in to the tough old man parts.

The film starts out great with rough and tough cowboys. One cannot remember who he is.  Or how he got his strange bracelet that he cannot seem to get off. Oh and I doubt it would be any surprise to say that somewhere down the ling aliens will get involved. Can't go in to too much detail as there are a lot of surprises, twists and turns.

Daniel Craig, while he did and incredible job in "" Casino Royale"" was apparently told in this movie, to do what he did in that movie. I'm sorry, but his expressions never changed in this movie.

Secondly, the plot and yes I'm going to spoil it for some of you, aliens show up in the old west for.................. wait for it............................. Gold. Oh and the girl in the movie, is also an alien, only she's tracking the other aliens after they destroyed her planet. She's here to help, and that's the movie. Yep, now while I like Harrison ford, and Daniel craig. They seemed miscast in this movie, well Ford at least, he looked like he was going to have a stroke or heart attack at any moment, craig just seemed misused. But the big problem with this movie was that it didn't know what it wanted to be, and Sci-fi mixed with Westerns never work out. Go look into the archives, they're called B-movies.

With all of the talent associated with this movie (both behind and in front of the camera) I naturally expected a thoroughly enjoyable and watchable film. I wasn't looking for a masterpiece...just a solid entertaining couple of hours. But I guess even the best of Hollywood can produce a dud every once in a while and that, unfortunately, is definitely the case here. It sure starts out with an intriguing premise...cowboys and aliens, for crying out loud! I mean, how can you beat that...right? However, about the only thing I can say I remotely enjoyed was the musical score. I won't try to describe the plot...there are already many fine reviews that have done that. Just want to add my advice to the prospective viewer and DVD buyer...walk away from this turkey...VERY far away.",1327363200,,899,4.806451612903226
4318791,3,B004BDOF1C,"When I was trying to think of a clever title for this review, ""SciFi Ship Crashes Into Western (and Ruins It)"" came to mind as did ""High Noon Meets Independence Day (and They Don't Get Along)"". But those titles might inadvertently reflect a bit more frustration than I actually experienced with Cowboys and Aliens (plus those titles just weren't really very clever). So instead of trying to express my opinion of this flick in the title of my review, I'll just briefly say it since I'm so late to the party here.

I actually thought that Cowboys and Aliens started off quite well. The story seemed to be progressing towards a climactic, epic finish. The plot builds with a lot of fun, but clich, Wild West bad guys, sheriffs, drunks and posses bickering about this and that. Seems like a decent, well done Western...and then the aliens show up and the movie goes from pretty good to pretty silly.

I do think that the acting was quite good. It has Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde....A great cast with Iron Man's Jon Favreau directing. The cast sold me on sticking with the film with an open mind, and while the CGI was excellent the action became goofy and unrealistic.

I was entertained (and I'll probably even give the movie another watch-through when it comes to cable). But ultimately, Cowboys and Aliens is a rental at best; don't waste your money on purchasing the DVD.",1327363200,,1420,4.694779116465863

4318795,4,B004BDOF1C,"I totally expected this to be a good movie... and I was not disappointed in any way.  I love westerns and alien movies so, when this movie came out I was so excited because it combined both.  Tough guy Daniel Craig is kind of hard to believe as a cowboy under normal circumstances but.... WHO CARES!  I loved the movie.  A great storyline, good acting, a lot of good old fashioned western action...even the Native American Indians got involved.  It was great!  Good graphics.  I highly recommend it!",1327190400,,499,4.6022727272727275
4318796,3,B004BDOF1C,"Well, you have to say this about Cowboys and Aliens: It knows exactly what is. I mean, the name of the movie IS Cowboys and Aliens. So you have to tip your hat to it for its honesty. I have never read the graphic novel that this movie is based on, so I can't vouch for how close Jon Favreau's movie stays with it.

For once in a western, the main character really IS a ""Man With No Name"" as Daniel Craig wakes up in the middle of a desert in the Old West with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Unfortunately for him, the residents of the nearby town haven't forgotten him. They know him as Jake Lonergan, a notorious outlaw wanted for robbery and murder among other things. He doesn't help his situation by racking the ne'er do well son of the local cattle baron, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), in the groin either. Dolarhyde. Wow. That is a name steeped in all kinds of allusions, isn't it?....money, Mr. Hyde, formaldehyde, Dickens, etc. Woodrow is borderline psychotic because of his Civil War experiences so he lives up to some of the connotations of his name. Jake is about to get hauled off to trial to face his crimes, when ray beam blasting aliens from outer space send the whole town to Hell! Luckily for the humans, Jake has an alien wrist weapon that allows him to use the rootin tootin sci-fi tech of the aliens against them. Olivia Wilde also shows up as a mysterious gun-toting woman named Ella who is much more than she seems. And she stays that way, mysterious, before eventually giving some of her background that lasts all of 1 minute. Wilde is horribly utilized in this movie, mainly because her only function seems to be to say ""They're here"" when the aliens so obviously show up on the scene. It's up to Jake to find a way to lead the townspeople, outlaws, Native Americans, kids, and even dogs against some aliens who vaguely resemble miniature Rancors.

Like so many movies these days, Cowboys and Aliens is ok to watch once and be entertained, but you probably will never want to see it again. In that respect it reminds me a lot of Favreau's Iron Man films. And I can expand that to most movies based on comic books that have come out in recent years. They look flashy, they pop, they sizzle, but in the end they shrivel under closer inspection.

If there's one thing I can't stand about alien movies, it's when the aliens are basically just like us. In other words, Star Wars anthropomorphic boringness. I much prefer the creepiness of aliens like those in 2001, Solaris, or even the original Alien (although that may change after Prometheus). The whole ""the aliens are here to steal our resources"" shtick is just so old at this point. Can't we imagine aliens that go beyond just our own oil-sucking fantasies?

I was kinda surprised that Harrison Ford took this role since he's always critical of his Star Wars movies like they were so far beneath him. It almost made me laugh when I saw him go all Marlon Brando with Woodrow and try to make him into a living breathing character right out of Unforgiven. Daniel Craig did a good job even though without Bond behind his name, he's really not a leading man.

This movie didn't do very well, costing $163 million to make and only grossing around $100 million in the US. Taking foreign revenue into account, it made about a $10 million profit which is probably way below what the studio was expecting.

I wouldn't buy this movie, but it's definitely worth a rental.",1327104000,,3452,4.488853503184713
4318797,4,B004BDOF1C,The movie was filled with action which held a few surprising twists. It was very entertaining even though the battle over gold and planetary seemed a little far-fetched.,1327017600,,169,5.071428571428571
4318798,4,B004BDOF1C,"It's the Old Wild West and locals are putting aside their conflicts to battle the ""demons"" or what we would call aliens. Seems that the aliens want gold just like us humans and they're high tech is mining it while they abduct people to figure out their weaknesses. There's an actual story in here which I appreciate and some of the characters are beyond the typical archetypes but the focus is really on the action with meaty fistfights, lots of gunslinging, saloon drinking, fights on horse back and, of course, aliens with high tech and aliens that are gigantic compared to humans and move at an incredibly fast pace. How will the humans win? What's going to happen? Well, you know what's going to happen but it's all in good fun so don't act too surprised.

4318803,4,B004BDOF1C,"I must admit I wasn't expecting any more than a 2-3 star movie before I watched this. However, although it is pure schlock, it's very well done and surprisingly enjoyable. The atmosphere of the old West (or perhaps more accurately the atmosphere of movies about the old West) is captured in the opening sequences when a cowboy named Lonergan wakes up in the desert, and apart from Lonergan's unusual bracelet it looks like a Western of the 'misunderstood bad guy' type. Daniel Craig is the epitome of the hard-drinking villain with a heart of gold and no memory of who he is and what he has done and the ruffians and townsfolk he encounters look and sound authentic.

Then the trouble starts, with mysterious lights, explosions and ultimately attacks from (literally) out of nowhere, causing a number of supporting actors to fly up in the air, hooked like trout, and disappear attached to flying machines resembling giant invertebrates. After a perfunctory ""What the heck was that?"" the rugged Westerners set out to track down the abductors of their loved ones, aided by a kid, a dog and an enigmatic woman (Olivia Wilde) whose simple rural outfit is offset by her expensive Hollywood teeth. The showdown on the Mesa has the cowboys and Indians fighting on the same side against a common enemy. The kid and the woman (though not so much the dog, to my surprise) have a chance to show what they are made of, and the grizzled old rancher (Harrison Ford) develops a new respect for those of different ethnicity provided, of course, that they come from the same planet. There's happiness and sadness in the ending and a bit of good old Western philosophy, too.

All this, and the biggest lava lamps you've ever seen. That can't be bad!",1326758400,,1731,4.728476821192053
4318804,5,B004BDOF1C,"So I didn't see this one in theaters because just the concept seemed stupid to me.  Aliens and Cowboys.  Really?  Was Hollywood really this intellectually bankrupt that they were stooping to just putting two random concepts together and hoping they'd get something that the public liked?

I like many things that are opposites.  I love zombies, I love Marvel super heroes.  I didn't want to put them together, but unfortunately Marvel did and they got the abomination that is now known as Marvel Zombies.  I love Star Wars, and I love zombies, I NEVER wanted to put them together.  But Joe Scrhreiber did and we got the horrible steaming pile of ""book"" that was ""Death Troopers.""

So when I saw Aliens and Cowboys I threw my hands up in disgust and refused to pay $10.00 USD to see it in theaters, but when I saw it in the Red Box for $1.00, I figured that it was better than watching re-runs of Storage Wars so I picked it up for the night.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Right off the bat this starts out as a bad-ass western, and I haven't seen a good western in years!  So to see how awesome this was starting out was a HUGE surprise and a welcome one!  I also was questioning where the main character got his nifty little bracelet thingy and why he couldn't remember, but honestly I knew those questions would be answered soon so I kept watching.

I have NEVER seen Harrison Ford play a bad guy before, but he knocked it out of the park with this performance!  Having him play a cattle baron who is a former war hero in a wild west town was awesome!

Then the aliens show up.  I immediately thought, ""Okay here we go with the campy costumes and lame ships,"" but again I was wrong!  I was blown away by how good the special effects were, the ships looked awesome!  The explosions were cool, and the idea that something so small as a bracelet taking down these fighter ships was pretty friggin' awesome!

So then the ships are snatching up people and taking them back to their base to do god knows what with them.  We never really find out what they are doing with these people other than they are all standing around with some kinda restraints on and they're starring at a giant water balloon looking like zombies.

So we find out that the aliens are also taking members of the local Native American tribe and they want to get their family members back too and they're ready to ride off into battle but they need a leader.  Who better to do that then the guy who was Indiana Jones AND Han Solo?  Harrison Ford draws the aliens out and the cowboys and natives do battle with the aliens while the main character goes inside to find and free everyone.

We also find out that the aliens are harvesting gold for some reason.  This really bugged me.  What were they using it for?  We're never told.  Seriously, did it have monetary value on their planet?  Was it food?  Was it a fuel source?  Did they need it to build some sort of technology?  Seriously I don't care which, but just pick one and tell the audience.  Like in Avatar, we wanted the ore because it had monetary value and it had technological uses.  Or in Independence Day, the aliens came and wanted our planet cuz theirs was dead and they needed a new place to live.  Or even in Battle:  Los Angeles, the aliens needed water because they used it as a fuel source.  Just a little clarification would be nice.

So the movie ends and the alien foundry is blown up and everyone is rescued.  Harrison Ford's character and the main character put aside their differences and our main character rides off into the sunset.

It's true that this movie pokes some fun at westerns and science fiction, which is like a stab in the heart for people who take all this very seriously.  But if you pick up from the title that this is a complete fantasy, it's also a lot of fun.  At least I thought so.  There's even a bit of character development with Harrison Ford turning out to not be such a bad guy after all.  My only gripe is that this would seem to appeal to younger viewers as it has less sex than any blockbuster movie I can remember but why is it that sex is so bad while vaporizing dozens of people is fun for the whole family?  I guess I just wanted to see more of the young lady rising from the ceremonial fire.  She says ""Man, it got so hot in there I had to strip"" and Harrison Ford rushes over with a blanket and quotes Groucho Marx, ""I'm protecting your honor, which is more than you ever did!"".

Having said that,  the movie is really not worth the price of a movie house admission.  SCI FI at its worst.  The first part of the movie, about an hour or so, it is very slow even though greatly acted out by Ford and Craig.  Nothing is new or refreshing about this movie.  Let's see, the cattle baron rules over an entire western town.......Old stuff from old westerns.  The Aliens themselves,  seem to be taken out of the movie  ALIEN.  So, not much creativity there.  I said it in one of my previous posts,  whatever happened to good movie writers lately in Hollywood?  The plot and the dialogue were really silly at times.  And I also have seen better CG in other SCI FI movies.  Great, if you want to watch it on Netflix or cable, but not worth it the admission fee at the movies.",1326585600,,897,4.287425149700598
4318810,4,B004BDOF1C,"We enter the story by finding a man (Daniel Craig) unconscious in the desert. He awakes with no memory and discovers a strange device on his arm that, despite numerous efforts, he can't remove. Before he's made any real assessment of his situation, he's discovered by three men who believe he'll bring them a windfall when they turn him over to the authorities. But, despite his memory loss, he makes short work of his would-be captors and moves on. Victorious but still with no memory.

His wandering brings him to the nearby town of Absolution. Its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen until the local preacher (Clancy Brown) discovers him and offers to stitch the wound he (Craig) discovered when he awoke. Unfortunately, they are interrupted when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), son of the town's benefactor and all-around miscreant, causes a commotion and accidentally kills a Marshall and (Craig) subdues him. As a result, he's identified and arrested for crimes he's previously committed. Our amnesiac's name is Jake Lonergan and before being transferred, the town is attacked by mysterious creatures first referred to as demons but that are, of course, aliens. Hence the title.

I was as wary as anyone when I saw the title of this film. I expected a farce with a poorly written script and star-studded cast. While the cast is chock-full of familiar faces (Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and others) the film is engrossing, well-written, and easily one of the better films based on a comic book that I've seen in some time.",1326499200,,1539,4.938223938223938

4318821,1,B004BDOF1C,"Did you ever think you could equate sitting on the bowl with a movie? Hollywood does, and it has a pile of crap for you. It will shovel it out to you in concentrated measures. Aliens and Cowboys? Yeah, it could have worked, if you had an actual story... or convincing actors.

Okay, I'll give a quick rip on the plot and then get back into gear tearing this thing apart. A cattle rancher haggardly played by a strained Harrison Ford bumps heads with a ""cowboy"" (a stupefied Daniel Craig)who looks like someone (a very original mean outlaw) but doesn't know who he is. Aliens ( seemingly devised by a ten year old child's mind)show up for no reason but to hoard of all things, gold.

Yes, gold is important in the old west of course, so now  we have a ""plot"". A wacked-out space girl is thrown in for good measure. She knows who's who and what's what, although her body wasn't sure if it could come back from something. These wooden characters are the best you'll ever see as they read their clunky lines with script in pocket. Oh and the action! These cowboys and stilted Indians fight aliens with the skill of a teen video gamer. But does it drag? The viewer can stare at a ranchers knife, rope, spoon, and know for sure this will prove the western genre exists in front of us. I don't think I've ever seen (in the modern era) material so empty and contrived than this gargantuan mess.

I found it not only exciting and suspenseful but full of twists and shifting character
relationships, so that one has many different plot lines to follow. I have to admit, there are
rather a lot of glitches in the continuity, where they need to forget about, like, the guy is
tied up so how was he able to get up and do something essential to the plot. And there is feeling
that the conception of the monsters and their lair owes a lot to Ridley Scott's Alien. Still,
the movie just shoots along in a compelling way, and, bit by bit, all the mysteries laid out
in the beginning are explained. Then, too, there is more here than just, as the title says,
our side against their side. There's the theme of trust among strangers, and respect between
(human) adversaries. Because Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford start as mortal enemies.",1326240000,,928,4.596385542168675

Basically the title says it all: a disparate group of cowboys, (led by amnesiac gunman Daniel Craig and hard-bitten ex-Army Colonel Harrison Ford,) outlaws and Indians attempt to rescue a group of various loved ones kidnapped by invading aliens.  The film is exciting whether as a science fiction fantasy or a traditional western with science fiction aspects.  I greatly enjoyed the film as a traditional western before the aliens even made an appearance.  I grew up loving westerns and still do.  Perhaps thats the reason this film tanked: today's young people just cannot relate to most westerns and stayed away in droves.  Thats my only explanation. The film has excellent performances from the two leads and a terrific supporting cast, great special effects and exciting action sequences.  What more could you ask?
The blu-ray includes an extended version of the film (15 minutes) which I watched.  I frankly did not remember what the new scenes were.  Theres the usual""making of"" material (wherein most of the cast and producers fall all over themselves slobbering about the genius of the director, Jon Favreau.  Every ""making of"" segment on any DVD or blu-ray, whether the film is the biggest hit or biggest bomb, has one of these segments where the cast fall all over themselves proclaiming what a genius the director of the film is.  I guess every director today is the caliber of Hitchcock or John Ford.)  There are also very long interviews between Favreau and the cast and producers of the film.

You have to go into this realizing it's not a classic western and take it as an alien invasion movie set in the old west. In that capacity it works very well.

Daniel Craig proves once again that you need more than a buff bod to be a leading man.  He has zero charisma here, and like many second-rate British actors, he can't pull off even a broad regional American accent (like Western) to save his life.  Apparently the giant budget here didn't include a dialog coach -- or Craig just has a tin ear.

Fortunately the man can fight better than he can act, and the early scenes, where his gunfighter with amnesia tangles with some bad guys, pack some genuine punch.

Then come the aliens lassoing townsfolk -- it seems that the aliens hadn't discovered levitation rays back in the nineteenth century -- and the film gets relentlessly more silly and incredible.

About the only actor who rises above the nonsense here is the luminous Olivia Wilde, as a friendly (and extremely comely)alien.  I hope to see her again in movies much better than this one.

The DVD includes a number of extras, including making-of featurettes and director's commentary, if you have any curiosity about the production after watching this plodding ""floater oater.""

Before you know it, he runs afoul of a nasty Harrison Ford, and eventually the alien beings that the film's title implies.  This Extended Edition provides a stronger story than the theatrical cut (as well as some decent amounts of bloody violence), but despite that though there isn't really anything all that special about the film, other that the draw and appeal of its two stars.  The action sequences are well orchestrated by Iron Man director Jon Favreau, and there are some surprisingly creepy moments to be found as well.

Jack Lonergan (played by Daniel Craig) wakes to find a metallic cuff/weapon on his arm and no memory of who he is or how he got there. As he struggles to remember, he finds that he has to protect the world from an unknown threat. Along the way, he must align himself with Woodrow Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford) a greedy cattleman whose sole job seems to be protecting his spoiled son, some superstitious Indians who blame the white men for this new threat, and the beautiful/mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde) to defeat a new threat, aliens seeking gold.

The pros of this movie: There were some amazing and established actors involved. The setting (in the Old West) was extremely compelling. After all, what more could you ask for than a battle between the aliens and the earthlings......laser-like weapons against Old West weapons (i.e., arrows and guns)? There were plenty of gunfights....some you simply got lost in the battle scenes and scenery. There were even men on horseback fighting aliens in fast moving space vessels. The special effects were great and in and of themselves worth a 4.

The cons of this movie: With so much talent available to this director (Craig, Ford, Wilde, and several more), it was the plot that lacked real bite.  I felt that gold seeking aliens was (for lack of a better word)... pretty lame. Why would aliens who have access to any and everything, want earth's gold? I mean I would have rather the aliens wanted us for food (which isn't original but more likely) or the desire earth's most valuable resource, water like a lot of other movies and novels. Really I would have appreciated them wanting anything but our gold. It seemed that the aliens could have arrived on earth and taken secretly what they wanted without snatching humans and turning them into mindless beings. I don't know, I just thought that while I didn't expect this movie to win an Oscar, with the caliber of actors involved, it could have been better.",1325548800,2,2006,4.772334293948127
4318861,5,B004BDOF1C,"Is it science fiction? Is it a Western? What is a lot of science fiction but a Western with bigger and more sophisticated toys?

This is a big, gooey, hot-fudge-sundae of a movie, complete with eye candy. A rough-and-tumble character (Daniel Craig, the Steve McQueen of this latter day, looking like he's just been salivating to sink his teeth into a Western role all his life) wakes up in the middle of the desert with no memory and a peculiar device sealed on his left arm, the properties of which he has no clue. He also has a nasty wound in his side. While he's trying to sort this out, miscreants chance upon him and discover that perhaps they should have just kept going, as he deals with their attempts to interfere with him in an almost offhand way, adopting their dog as he does. His efforts to mend his injury at a seemingly deserted homestead turns up his first ally, a crusty preacher (Clancy Brown, a great utility actor who continues to pop up in good roles over a score of years), who sews up the wound after determining that whatever else this man-with-no-name is, he's not a consummate evil. This brings the injured man into the realm of a small cowtown, where he makes friends and enemies, finds out at least what his name is - to his detriment - and is thrown together with the rest of the populace in finding a way to combat the aliens, when they come to town after dark.

Great people are involved in this movie. The aforementioned Mr Craig, always watchable, is joined by that icon of American film, Harrison Ford (as a mean sumbitch called Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde, who runs the place because of his cattle baronry but who is inside just a big softy); a strong female lead (Olivia Wilde) as the mysterious Emma Swenson, good rider, good with a gun, and who packs a pretty mean wallop; Keith Carradine as the town's sheriff (I didn't recognize him at first); Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine, There Will Be Blood) as Percy Dolarhyde, Woodrow's spoiled son; Sam Rockwell, as the town saloon owner/doctor, on the verge of packing it in and going somewhere else; and Adam Beach, as a young man Woodrow took in as a child. In the business end of things, there are some heavy hitters as well; Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Jon Favreau. With all this firepower, something good was bound to come out.

Highly enjoyable from beginning to end, and adapted from a comic book, while the action takes on the spirit of a graphic story, the great technical effects and good acting make it realistic as well (as realistic as a movie with 9-foot ugly green aliens can be). Nothing dull here; the only part I found remotely unbelieveable was Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan calmly reclaiming a fighting force of thirty, formerly his gang, who have switched allegiance, by just ordering them about. I guess charisma is everything; I might be induced to do as I was told by Mr Craig, myself.

This was not a wasted 2 hours. A lot of movies these days produce a lot of noise and action, but this one provided a lot of story as well, and one that wasn't difficult to follow. And it's good to see a Western again, even if it's got aliens as its motivation. There was a lot of heart here. A very good adaptation from a comic book, and it's plain that everybody involved was having a great time as well. Don't miss the bonus features. I'd already like to see it again.

The movie is about these people in a town, set back in the days when cowboys and Indians were around, who find aliens have come to get something from them.  That is the story.  Then, you have a guy who was with a woman, though you never see them together, who wakes up and does not remember anything.  But, he has this weird thing around his wrist.  Turns out aliens may have taken him and the lady and some how he got away.  He is also wanted for killing the lady.  Though he may not have done that.  Get it?  That is the story.

Now for the bad part, or ""the movie"" itself.  Wow, so many things were wrong with this in my opinion.  Let me take it one step at a time.

First the actors.  There were a bunch of great actors in the movie.  Some you would see the entire time, others here and there.  But, for some reason, it felt like I was watching a trailer the entire time.  Almost like a movie they made to show at the Oscars.  It was very odd.

Next, the effects and backgrounds.  AWFUL,  everything that you see in the movie, you can tell that it is fake and not very well done.  The mountains may have been actually mountains, but they were the worst mountains that I've ever seen.  The times when you saw the aliens or the technology they used also seemed cheaply done.  It was like I was watching a damn commercial or something from 10 years ago.  Watch the movie and reply with what you think.

Next would be the story.  Ok, so aliens that are smart enough to fly around the never ending space and then find something on our planet they need and or want.  Are you telling me they would not just come, take what it was and leave without us even knowing?  For some reason they are pissed off and decide to kill the people.  But that is just a story choice I suppose.  For some reason, I could never get into this movie.  I love movies like this normally.  I am a 26 year old guy who is kind of a nerd.  But everything just felt so fake.  Like it was being shoved down my throat.  After 15 minutes, I had already forgotten what had happened before.  It was like I was watching something trying so hard to be funny, action packed, thrilling and mysterious, that never really got there.  Oh, and it you have eyes, you may want to skip this movie.  Why you ask?  For at least 2/5 of the movie.  My family and I could not see a damn thing.  The lighting if some of the worst I've ever seen, or haven't seen for that matter.  We were all like ""what the hell is going on?""  At one part one of the characters asks if the man can see his target.  I busted out laughing.  The end is boring and you will probably be upset you wasted your time watching.  For so many good actors and a good director, this movie sucked.  If this is what aliens bring, then let us send E.T back home!!!!

As I said, we rented this from FIOS.  So, I can not review the special features or the packaging.",1325462400,7,3043,4.078098471986418

It is one of those movies that when you go it you are not going to see a documentary, but a fiction film.  You never want to look for too deep of meaning in this kind of film.  Overall it was a great ride.

We then rented this via Amazon Prime when some friends came over last week.  We watched the extended version thinking we might see some interesting things not in the original.  The problem with this is I broke my own rule on deleted scenes.  The are deleted for a reason and especially with this one.  The Extended version has about 15 minutes more than the theatrical version and it is ALL DIALOGUE.. It slows this movie too far down and really makes it seem to drag.

I've already switched all our DVD players in the house for Blu-rays so I have no need for a DVD copy and I'm from old school and at this point, I don't want to mess with digital copies of movies.  I'll make this the first movie that I will refuse to buy (combo).  I'll just wait for my turn to get it from Netflix to watch.  On another note, I don't want no part of 3D.

4318878,1,B004BDOF1C,"""Cowboys & Aliens."" The title immediately makes you believe the movie just may be an action/scifi/western that should be, at minimum, entertaining to watch. The title was correct on the first three accounts. The movie is part action, part science fiction, and a great deal of western, rolled into one. What the title does not convey is the medical aspect to the movie. As my husband and I watched, brain cells were being destroyed, thousands at a time, with each passing second we took in this movie. I am curious, had this attack on brain cells happened previous to the movies making to the writers, producers, director, and actors?
I enjoy independent films, slapstick comedy, purely dumb yet fun scripts, even movies that reach a bit too far into the realm of possibilities. I love everything from the Die Hard and Mission Impossible series, Bourne series, to the movie Friday, National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and darker, deeply saddening, historical movies such as Schindler's List. Momma Mia, although I'm not a fan of musicals was fun, greatly entertaining. ""Cowboys and Aliens,"" falls under no other category other than horrifically ridiculous, a colossal waste of time and money, and a direct assault on most of our intelligence.

4318883,3,B004BDOF1C,"What impresses most about ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is not the special effects - or even Olivia Wilde's blue eyes which could quite literally level entire continents with a single glance (how the camera adores this woman) - it's the sheer presence of Daniel Craig. How did he get this cool all of a sudden? And there's even a convincing chemistry between him and Olivia Wilde that should be enough to worry Rachel Weisz. But for me that's where the good news peters out...

I suspect like a lot of movie lovers, I was really looking forward to ""Cowboys & Aliens"". But it just somehow feels like ""Captain America"" or ""Green Lantern"" - two of the lamest comic-book adaptations of 2011. In fact you just wish Hollywood would leave these easy sources alone and reach for something exciting and new - genuinely original even.

One upside however is the superb ensemble cast - veterans include the ever watchable Harrison Ford as ruthless rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde who is at logger-heads with Keith Carradine - the put-upon Sheriff of Absolution - a frontier town in the Wild West of 1873. The younger blood is supplied by Sam Rockwell as a bar-owning doctor - with Paul Dano as Woodrow's mouthy gun-wielding trouble-attracting son (he was the preacher boy in ""There Will Be Blood""). Noah Ringer is a scared kid and there's nice work from Abigail Spencer and Ana De La Reguera as a prostitute and wife. But best of all is Clancy Brown as the town preacher Meacham trying to explain to the town's frightened populace what the alien 'machines' mean (he was the corrupt guard Bryon Hadley in the mighty ""Shawshank Redemption""). He gives the piece a badly needed earthiness and heart.

But ""Cowboys & Aliens"" should of course be a special-effects bonanza with a howdy-dowdy twist - yet the CGI is underwhelming and even hammy. The pace also slows a lot, it's overly long and there are outdoors battle scenes towards the end in the daylight that resemble a bad B-movie set. In fact I think maybe the effects are part of the problem - not enough of them - not impressive enough. Sure in some instances the Alien creatures look suitably nasty and icky (like oversized grasshoppers) - but in others they actually look ludicrous...and that can't be good. It's a shame because the story's not half bad and unfolds nicely - but you can't help but feel that without 007's sheer star quality, there'd be little actually worth watching.

The BLU RAY picture is sharp (as you'd expect from a movie of this size) and the 5.1 soundtrack rattles around your speakers with impressive clarity - but the picture never rises up above the merely good - and instead of thrilling me to the core - the explosions irritated after a while in their desperate over-the-top need to impress. The extras also give away way too much of what is good in the film (so don't watch them first).

""Cowboys & Aliens"" is fun in places for sure, but it's a 3-star underachiever that ultimately leaves you wondering why Director Jon Favreau couldn't have delivered more given the great canvass he had...

Daniel Craig is a reliable hero, and Harrison Ford is in veteran character-mode. Olivia Wilde is especially good.
Special effects and sound effects pretty make up the fun stuff, but the story about love, family and togetherness resonates.

Getting the Indians and the bandits together to beat the bad guys is an idea I liked a lot; don't remember such an idea since Victor Fleming's '42 All Through the Night (Bogart), where the rival NYC gangs got together to beat up Nazi infiltrators. It's all about survival, country and a good story.

This is not the case however, despite the fact that the special features reveal it to be based on a comic book by the same name. With big name stars like Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised to find that Cowboys and Aliens was in fact much more of a gritty action movie. This film is a proper heir to both the western tradition and the monster movie style of filming. There was something unique in this mash-up, which allowed for a cast of characters with absolutely no prior concept of aliens.

 Therefore, aliens got called demons by characters, for lack of a better word, for example. Also, the Old West setting absolutely emphasized the sense of being out-gunned by the technologically advanced enemy. You've got some kind of flying saucer swooping down, and cowboys shooting a revolver at it. Success seems impossible without outside aid. There is also a lovely amnesia-related plot focused on the main character, yielding some amusing lines in the midst of an otherwise grim film. I'll never forget the whole audience gasping in the theater during a scene where a character is getting medical attention, old west style. Did I say gasping? I meant gagging.

 I was also completely pleased that this DVD release of Cowboys and Aliens had special features. They were brief, but did just enough to really help me appreciate the work that went into the filming. I especially liked what they had to say about the process of coming up with the alien design in a feature called Outer-Space Icon. The scope of the spectacle was also fun, as it talked about some of the stunts actually done by the actors themselves. I didn't look at the commentary, but I might, next time I watch this movie, as I will undoubtedly want to see it again and again.",1324944000,4,1866,4.6454545454545455

I saw it less than an hour ago on blu-ray, and no regrets. It was a little boring at first, but the story got better, and so did the action. I don't want to ruin the movie, but expect a lot of action. A bit emotional scene to make the story flow, but don't expect much of that. This movie actually makes more sense then what the title says. The scenery is great too. It was worth spending 2 hours watching. Probably not worth watching in the theater, or buying the movie. I would not watch it again, but rent it if you want to check it out.

4318911,4,B004BDOF1C,"I rented this movie with some trepidation due to the mixed reviews. I love Westerns and I love Science Fiction movies from both genres that are fun. Conceptually this is a great idea mixing the genres as they have done. My initial review is that it begins very well, sags in the middle, then picks up in the final few acts.

The special effects are very well done. I really enjoy the design of the aliens. They are menacing and threatening with no regard for human life. The acting is very well done. Both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig offer believable characters that are not one dimensional. Both men are tough, full of pride and though they are on different sides of the issue at the start of the movie it is not so easy to distinguish the typical western good guy from the bad guy. The plot is creative and they way typical adversaries in western movies all come together to battle the aliens flows well into the story and is not forced and artificial.

Once the aliens arrive and the back story of Daniel Craig's character is explored is when the movie begins to sag. Other things also happen that slows down the pacing of the movie. One event is the revelation of another alien which is used to explain the motive of the invading aliens. I think they could have found another way for exposition and it would have quicken the pacing. The other reason the middle of the movie sags is that many scenes take place in the dark and it is difficult to view what was happening. I wish movie makers would lighten night scenes just a bit so we the viewer could see a bit more of what is going on.

The final confrontation with the aliens is when the movie come back to life and returns to the pacing and quality story telling that it began with. Although a bit uneven all in all the movie does deliver an exciting, fun and gritty combination of the two genres.",1324684800,,1857,4.3768115942028984

I'll agree that no really new ground was plowed with this one but that in no way compromised the overall effect of the story. It did have some interesting twists and also some very predictable elements.

The picture quality and sound are both up to the task and contributed to the excitement of the film. As with most science fiction one has to accept the assumptions if one is to enjoy the story; I was able to do that and I think most viewers will be able to do that also.

One might think that mixing Western and Sci-Fi topics would be a recipe for disaster yet this well done film manages to pull it off. Excellent acting, scenography, cinematography; exquisitely detailed representations of aliens and their technology; innovative mix of characters that include cattle ranchers, townspeople, Chiricahua Apaches, alien saviours & gold-digging ""demons"" from other planets. A touch of the spiritual with a peyote-like ceremony; the film also teaches an effective method for stopping one's mind.

Attention to detail is everywhere. From the cursory flick of the camera to Indian scalps on frontiersman's saddle at the beginning of the film, to the intricate design of the ""arm-laser gun"" and the space ship. The amazing Western landscapes (Escalante?) had my undivided attention. I liked how the director played with genre cliches, always using a light touch and a sense of humor. This is the XXIst century's answer to the often dark and surreal 'comedies of the absurd'; to Bunuel, Burroughs and Monthy Python - and I have to say I much prefer CAAs to The Exterminating Angel.

In other words, this is a well done, produced and directed film that works from a  weak script .  For us, it brought great visuals and an entertaining  couple of hours.  Can't go wrong on this one.",1324339200,,1401,5.091703056768559

My personal favorite was Paul Dano as Percy -- his characters are usually so moody/emo/dark-and-twisted that it was a pleasure to see his face light up in a smile AND his reaction to Jake Lonergan was hilarious.  Going from spoiled rotten kid to mewling, terrified kid in the jail allowed him to really show his stuff!  True, Harrison Ford's character was predictable but the characters were allowed to grow.

The plot sounded unorthodox at first. Cowboys versus Aliens? How absurd it was. Then, I realized cowboys were just fantasy in Hollywood films just like aliens. Real-life cowboys, in their period, did not behave as the Hollywood ones. After this shift in thinking, I enjoyed watching it.

It showed that bad people were not always bad. Also, it proved ""United we Stand, Divided we Fall"". It did those things in a subtle way, not preaching.  Paul Dano was one of the reasons I liked this picture. His acting as the son of cattle baron Woodrow (Harrison Ford) was so convincing that I really hated his character!

My one star rating is for the ""ultraviolet"" option that apparently comes with this particular combo pack version of the movie. First of all, it was not clear (and still is not) from the Amazon advertisement that this was part of the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy combo pack. If it were clear and if I had known then what ""ultraviolet"" was, I would have thought twice about purchasing this combo set. I usually purchase the blu-ray/digital copy combo pack versions of new movies so that I can have a digital version for my mobile content viewers (phones, laptops, tablets etc). Ultraviolet is a ""new"" streaming option that is now being pushed and included by some of the studios in combo packs. The idea being that the ultraviolet digital version exists as part of ""your"" cloud account on the particular studio's server. This version can then supposedly be streamed to any of your devices at any time (if you have the right hardware and software). Merits and practicalities of streaming video content aside, because the studios are so intent on trying to establish this new format you cannot download the traditional digital copy that is included with the combo pack without FIRST signing up for an ultraviolet account on the studio's website. Yes, yet another group wants to know your demographic, to know your email address and to subject you to their spam. To add insult, once you have signed up for an ultraviolet account, you are only able to get your iTunes digital copy version via the net and not off of the combo pack dvd inserted into your computer as you normally would. What used to take 5 minutes to add to an iTunes library now takes 90! what a feature!

Even if one ignores the fact that this streaming model requires a studio-specific website account, the net value added of an ""ultraviolet"" option seems less than obvious. If you are at home you can already stream the entire contents of an iTunes library via AppleTV (or from a PC via similar hardware) and if you are not at home you would only be able to effectively stream from the studio's cloud if you had a good internet connection at your location. Considering that the memory capacities of mobile media players are growing rapidly and that most now come in versions that are able to hold much more than a day's worth of movies, why do we really need streaming at all? We probably don't. The studios, however, do benefit from this new format. It instantaneously it tells their marketing departments who is watching their content and when and how often. More importantly it provides them with a new format to sell and a new reason to raise prices. We already pay a premium for the higher quality of blu-ray and a premium for inclusion on the blu-ray release of a digital copy for our mobile devices. Streaming is not free. The studios have to maintain accounts and servers to support it. Personally ""ultraviolet"" streaming is not something I will ever use and thus I have no desire to support it or to pay for the premium that will surely be associated with it.

if you wish to push back on format creep and costs then do not purchase combo packs that include an ultraviolet version

Obviously it would be helpful if Amazon made it clear when these options are being included",1324080000,41,3467,4.650897226753671

4318946,1,B004BDOF1C,"Positives:
The storyline was novel and had potential, but ...
The CGI at times was fairly good.
The acting by Daniel Craig carried the rest of the acting.

Negatives:
To take this novel idea and then script and direct it into a stereotypically and heavily borrowed ""aliens invade"" plot and scenes was sad to see.
Aliens: Alien shape is unlikely since living organisms put energy into developing either intelligence or large physicality - not both. Also, not physically possible strange appendages that either had a structural material (like bone) and little connective material or were all connective and little structural. The aliens had that stereotypic and borrowed gray look of menacing claws, teeth, extra appendages and run and jump like Cheetahs - sure! So I wonder what our carnivore aliens ate on the way over? ""Burgers in Space!"" take out. Usual alien baby growing pods to be blown up later. The people who make these things up must have never graduated from high school and want to de-educate the viewing public down to their level.
Space Ship: Typical vehicle which defies the laws of physics in mass, size, material, external decoration and worst of all still used chemical propulsion which incidentally would take the equivalent of the Earth's mass as energy to propel and take 50,000 years from any reasonably nearby star. How it buried itself two thirds into the earth invoked incredulity. Looks good, though.
Robot mini space ships: Like the aliens had another familiar look - flying dragonflies that somehow could carry a 400meters of cable and lasso people to haul them in with no ill physical effects on the captives.
Cowboys & Natives: Bar fights, street duels and Natives acting like a '50s western hostile all add up to the worst collection of stereotyped characterizations seen since aliens became the popular bad-ass also around the '50s.

Plot: Aliens came all this way to find gold! First of all, they could find it a whole lot easier by just collecting it in the dust of interstellar space or asteroids. Second, they could have found most of it at banks, especially on the East Coast, and not in a desert. Never was explained why gold was the goal. Too many inconsistencies in the plot such as fighting the aliens in the open next to the armed space craft and not force them to chase up steep canyon walls where the advantage is always to the higher positioned. What the alien girl really looked like as well as her story - as abrupt as it was. She certainly took the correct form to sell a film. The alien examination of people had the usual 18th century look with, the standard Hollywood effect - laser scalpels. The reason given was to explore for weaknesses. Must not be very bright if they needed so many to cut open. Anyway, why aliens with that technology would need to worry about human weaknesses is beyond logic.

Summary: The translation of the comic book idea into a movie script was too quickly and poorly executed and too reliant on directors and effects people stuck in the same old, but admittedly still sells, rut.

Is it sci-fi?  Is it a western?  Is it lighthearted romp or to be taken seriously?  I have nothing against genre mash-ups-in fact, there have been several pretty good ones over the years (""Outlander"" for example).  The problem with Cowboys and Aliens though is that it's so busy trying to be everything that it ends up being nothing.  I had heard a lot of mediocre to poor reviews of this film going in, so I already had my expectations in check.  Really though-I wanted to like this movie simply because it's my kind of movie.  When all was said and done though it still managed to disappoint.

I will give the team credit for creating an interesting mix of western and sci-fi. Kudos as well for combining Han Solo with James Bond. These are two iconic actors with great acting chops.

Harrison Ford does a great job as a cynical old war horse who's plagued with a fool for a son. Daniel Craig passes as a man who has forgotten everything about his past yet loves his hat...that crazy hat.

I thought the aliens were well done. Even though Steven Spielberg had a hand in this film, you will not find friendly ETs anywhere. These creatures want our gold and are insanely fast.

The script was decent. You can't blame the film too much whenever the script passes through as many hands as this one did. While the plot seems to drag often, you can always play the fun game of guessing how many times Craig will take off or put on his freaky hat.

I wasn't looking for some dramatic movie with an amazing plot, I went for just a good action flick.

The premise of the story is pretty weak to begin with, but that can be overcome with great dialog and great actors...

I love Wilde, Craig and Harrison, but they were just average in this film. Never felt a connection with the other actors either, when characters died, I felt nothing. I love great action sequences, but while the effects were good (though the actual aliens were rather cheesy), nothing was spectacular.

The dialog is definitely the weakest part of the movie. There are certain places in a movie where you just KNOW this is a place for a great line that makes you laugh or cry, but this movie didn't deliver. I found myself saying ""Really? That was the line they went with there?""

If you go into this movie with no expectations of it being great, you will probably leave saying ""that was... good... I guess"", but how can you expect a movie starring Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig to be simply average?

4318962,4,B004BDOF1C,"*** No Spoilers at All***

I had mixed expectations about Cowboys and Aliens. At first I was quite intrigued by the over-all idea of mixing a western with a sci-fi, and also having Jon Favreau direct such a film greatly boosted my lust to watch this film. However it got mixed reviews and did not seem to stay in theaters for too long. I should have known better to listen to the negative reviews.

Cowboys and Aliens is a very fun movie which is a western drama wrapped in an alien action movie. I am not a fan of western movies at all, however with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford at the helm in this movie, I knew to look past my reservations about western flicks. Even though it has a fast pasted start, Cowboys and Aliens does not waive from building a character. Harrison Ford in particular has a very strong disposition and I felt as though I could relate to his personality and character the most. Daniel Craig did a great job for such a complicated role he had.

I was blown away by the special effects, yes you could tell that they were CGI, however they were done very well and blended in perfectly with the environment. The sound effects also were very well done.

The picture and audio quality of this Blu-ray are some of the best I have ever seen and heard. The PQ in particular was breathtaking. There was little to no grain and the depth and clarity were outstanding throughout. The bonus features were also great. Many movies lately seem to leave out bonus features which we all take the time to enjoy.

Over-all I am very happy with my blind buy and greatly enjoyed this movie. Some friends came over, and out of the hesitant six of us, we all loved it. Much better than expected. Highly recommended and quite enjoyable.",1323648000,10,1737,4.432601880877743
4318963,4,B004BDOF1C,"So it's not Avatar or True Grit, but I enjoyed the entire movie.  I considered it to be both a spoof of Clint Eastwood/spaghetti westerns and alien movies.  No one will win an oscar for this, but if you are a fan of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford or Olivia Wilde, you will enjoy seeing them in very different roles.

Yes the plot is predictable and there are no life lessons, but the entire concept is unique and creative, and that is to be applauded.",1323648000,,448,4.309523809523809
4318964,4,B004BDOF1C,"It's strange how a movie about cowboys and aliens can be both original and a bit cliche at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but the human drama in between alien attacks is old fashioned and familiar. Example? Gruff, stubborn rancher Harrison Ford distrusts Indians, but later has to save the Indian chief in the heat of battle, and the two make eye contact and nod to each other out of respect. As a fan of westerns, i've seen that moment countless times before in other movies. Still, its all in good fun and very well produced.

But even though it had an all star production team and a strong cast, I think this film fell flat with all it tried to do.

I am not going to go into what the film was supposed to do, but I think it failed as a western film, it failed as an alien film and probably was one of the biggest disappointments of the year.

4318968,4,B004BDOF1C,"""Cowboys and Aliens"" rode into theaters with a unique premise but the movie plays out like a cross of a couple of other films. Imagine if H.G. Wells had written ""War of the Worlds"" as a western instead of taking place in Victorian England and if it was crossed with Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and you'll get an idea as to how director Jon Favreau's film of the graphic novel of the same name plays out. The film reminds me a bit of Ray Harryhausen's ""The Valley of Gwangi"" if we replace the dinosaur with aliens--an interesting if not entirely successful combination of two very different genres.

The first hour of the film works extremely well and Daniel Craig who resembles Steve McQueen from ""The Magnficient Seven"" fits the role of Jake Lonergan (a man who has no memory of what he's done or who he is) perfectly. He's discovered in the middle of nowhere by a trio of hunters with a weird mechanical device attached to his wrist that can blast anything to smithereens. After he's arrested in town Longergan finds the device handy in fighting alien spaceships that fly in and rope the towns people like cattle.

If nothing else the first hour proves that should Daniel Craig choose to do a western and play a character like Eastwood's ""The Man-With-No-Name"", he'd do a terrific job. A bit of trivia about the movie--Ford has played oppostie TWO actors that have played James Bond (Craig and Sean Connery in ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"").

Harrison Ford as cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde does a good job as Longergan's nemesis who ends up working with Longergan to try and save his son.

The Blu-ray looks terrific with a demo quality disc. The film looks amazingly sharp throughout and has nice depth without sacrificing the ""look"" of a film. Audio is terrific--it's a strong, immersive Lossless presentation and it helps one appreciate the terrific sound mixing and editing done on the film.

The special features include a commentary track from the director, a documentary that covers the film from conception to production. You can also unlock an interactive ""second screen"" presentation of the special features on your iPad. Although I have an iPad I really wanted to just watch the material rather than play with this special ap/feature. It uses Universal's U-Control features.

We also get both the theatrical cut of the movie and an extended one that runs about 17 minutes longer and actually (in my opinion) improves the film.

You can also use the (dreaded)Ultra-Violet streaming format to watch the film and there's also a DVD included as well as the option of downloading a digital copy of the film.

Although the second half of the movie is flawed, I didn't think that ""Cowboys and Aliens"" was quite as bad as everyone made it out to be when it was released theatrically and, certainly, the extended cut is better than the theatrical version with better character development and a couple of extended scenes. Although ""Cowboys and Aliens"" isn't as good as Favreau's other movies, it's still entertaining and does exactly what the title suggests--pitting cowboys from the old west against butt ugly aliens.",1323561600,3,3140,4.845149253731344

4318970,4,B004BDOF1C,"This is a fun movie with a cool premise....basically, aliens are attacking and stealing people in the old west. It falls on a posse of cowboys to try and track the aliens down to recover their loved ones and find out why the aliens are here and doing what they are doing. Daniel Craig makes a great hard-bitten cowboy. He is both a good guy and a hardened criminal, although he is also amnesiac, and wakes to find a strange bracer attached to his wrist. As seen in the commercials, the bracer is a piece of alien technology and a powerful weapon. Harrison Ford plays an ex-Colonel, and is also a hard-a^%. They essentially represent two factions forced to team up to track the aliens. Add Olivia Wilde, who is classically beautiful as always, and a bunch of other recognizable actors, and you end up with a pretty good cast.

The story itself has some highs and lows. Some points of the plotline are a little hard to swallow, even with the fantastic nature of the movie. However, the development is paced well, and the fun outweighs the flaws. They even mix in some social messages regarding racism and greed into the equation. The aliens are pretty cool looking and the desert settings are really stunning at times.

This was a good movie overall. It isn't very cerebral, but if you enjoy an action film with a little meat to the story, i think you will enjoy this. If you are highly critical of any movie that isn't Shawshank or some such, you should probably stay clear of this one.

Too bad, then, that the actual film this describes turned out to be a flop. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys & Aliens is exactly the kind of genre mash-up that contemporary audiences eat up heartily; 007 himself plays a wandering stranger with no memory who stumbles into the New Mexico town of Absolution, only to find that the town's residents don't take too kindly to strangers. However, when a mysterious otherworldly menace begins an assault on the town, the stranger must team up with the local lawman to battle for humankind's survival. So what was the major problem here? I felt that, despite appealing performances from Craig and Ford, the film simply shifted its tone too abruptly and too often, never quite settling into a comfortable and effective groove.

The sci-fi part was ok but I think the script never really came together.....I would have much preferred to see these characters continue in a classic western story.

The acting was great, if Tron Legacy didn't do it for me already now I really have the hots for Olivia Wilde.

The only thing I have trouble with in the entire movie is how few people recognized the main character.  If you have any idea how rural small communities work you would know at one or two people in town at the least would recognize the main character as soon as he walked in.  This is true of anyone with a house within one and maybe even two days riding distance, and this character's house was obviously within a days ride.  The lack of character recognition was a major plot point, but it really didn't work with him having a home close by.

Now, for the Ultra Violet Digital copy aspect so many of you are interested in since it's new.

It worked.

There was some murky directions and uncertainty in my initial setup.  Let me clarify, you have to go to the Ultra Violet site to setup an account THEN you have to do the whole URL and number thing from the provided coupon.  One does link to the other, but it's not really clear.  After you register at the Ultra Violet site, then you register/redeem at Universals, THEN you log into a content providers site with a coupon code.  I chose Amazon because it's the only one I use.  I recall Vudu, iTunes and one other I don't recall being on the list.  I now have this movie not only on BluRay and DVD, but I also have it in my Amazon collection which is great, even if a meteorite strikes my apartment while I'm out I'll at least still have the digital copy.

I'm a Linux user, I'm generally against DRM, but the whole store it on Amazon watch it online aspect isn't so bad, partially because it's OS agnostic.  Except for Android.  I can't play it on Android right now to save my soul.  There's a nifty PocketBlu app that's useless to me because it doesn't like the fact my phone is rooted.  I have a choice, I can have a rooted phone and have two days worth of battery, or I can put the original firmware back on, and have 12 hours worth of battery even if I don't actually use my phone because the spyware my provider installed is constantly transmitting and calling home with all sorts of privacy invasion.  So watching it from my phone is right out.  As for the second screen remote control awesomeness part of the app?  It doesn't work either.  I don't know if that's because it's rooted or it just doesn't work.  I know my network configuration is just fine because I can remote control my BluRay player with the LG app and I can do nifty DLNA/UPnP things with my player and other software on my phone.

I wrote a really long review on the whole Ultra Violet thing on my Live Journal, but Amazon doesn't like for you to put links in reviews.  If you simply search for my name and Live Journal with a couple of extra key words I'm sure you can find it.

I chose to base my review only on the movie and not the digital copy stuff because I was buying a movie, I consider the digital copy stuff as mostly a bonus feature, but make no mistake, I do not approve of the redemption expiration date on the digital copy.  If it's advertised as part of the package then it should work regardless of when you buy the package.  I buy movies that I know have sat in warehouses for three or four years based on the coupons inside all the time, that purchase depletes reserve inventory which moves the publisher closer to another release so the publisher profits no matter when I buy it.  My purchase should not have an offer plastered on the front cover that can no longer be utilized not due to any real technical reason but only because ""I said so"".",1323475200,,3831,4.2924791086350975

The only other thing that made me groan was the fact that, like most films, they cast Hispanics as Native Americans in many cases. I'll give them credit, though. They did at least have some Native Americans portraying Native American characters. That's more than can be said for a lot of movies. The effects were pretty good and the film was well-paced with bursts of action and little spaces to let you catch your breath. There were even a few sprinkles of humor in there if you paid attention.

The audience was kind of torn between ""is is it sci-fi or is it action-adventure?"" Of course in time we all grew to love the Predator franchise as a hybrid film. I think Cowboys and Aliens will be more appealing 10 years from now than it does present day, which in a way is a praise.

However, with heavyweights like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, Cowboys and Aliens delivers on all fronts.

Based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys and Aliens tells the story of a stranger who has no memory of who he is that happens to show up in the town of Absolution. When townsfolks start coming up missing; he, a traveler, and a wealthy cattleman must band together to fight the aliens who are abducting them.

What I loved most about the movie is that it is played as seriously as possible, despite the fact that the title might bring a chuckle. It's a serious Western that's gritty yet spectacular as well. If I had any reservations about the movie, it would be that the movie runs way too long. By the time you reach its' two-hour mark, you're ready to give up on the film.

4319010,4,B004BDOF1C,"I was skeptical when I heard about this film, I mean, cowboys fighting space monsters?  It seemed like too much of a stretch, especially since only a few Europeans were even dreaming that such things were possible.  However, given the actors, I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a look-see while on a long airplane trip.  And from the first moment, when the hero wakes with amnesia and a strange metal bracelet, the characters drew me into a much better-than-average story.  It was even hard scifi without a whiff of fantasy, though what the aliens could do definitely would have seemed like magic or demons to the men of that time.

The plot even has some good twists.  D Craig makes a wonderful tough guy who deep down is grieving even if he can't remember why.  He demonstrates his propensity to deadly violence right away, but there is something principled about it or seemingly so.  After a quick imbroglio, he wanders into a town that is riven by a spoiled gunslinger, whose father is apparently a brutally evil rancher.  Craig is also approached by a mysterious and beautiful woman, who seems to know a lot about him.  When they seem ready to kill eachother, the town is attacked, setting them on an adventure together as Craig discovers the metal object is a weapon.  Add Indians and a band of outlaws (who know Craig as a leader) into the mix and you begin to wonder if any of it is going to make sense.  That the rest of the movie succeeds so well, maintaining a sense of mystery and awe at least in me, is a testament to an unusually intelligent script.

One of the best themes in the film is how the humans band together, each bringing skills from their cultures and experience, to fight the baddies.  It might sound silly, but it really works well.  For example, the Indians give a potion to Craig that liberates his memory.  I don't want to play the spoiler, so won't say anything more, but it is a raucous ride with great CGI.

Warmly recommended.  It won't be what you expect, if you like hard scifi to begin with, that is.",1323216000,,2042,4.487804878048781

4319013,4,B004BDOF1C,"Let's get this straight right from the start: I cannot possibly write an unbiased review of this movie.  I was raised in the 90's, the son of parents raised in the 50's and 60's.  James Bond, STAR WARS, and Indiana Jones were instilled in me at an early age, as were the great sci-fi and western flicks of yesterday.  COWBOYS & ALIENS is basically the summation of all of my childhood fantasies.  Possibly, this applies to you as well.  If so, you'll know exactly where I'm coming from.

But if it doesn't...well, you may still be in for a treat.  John Favreau pulls a few punches, but you don't really notice.  The film revolves around Jake Lonergan, a wanted criminal who awakes in the desert with no knowledge of who he is (when asked what he knows, he stoically replies: ""English"").  In town, Lonergan has a run-in with Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), a spoiled rich boy who loves to shoot his guns off.  Percy's ex-Confederate daddy (Ford) comes riding into town, with a bone to pick with Lonergan.  Unfortunately, a few aliens intervene, kidnapping some townsfolk, and the two foes must join forces to save the day.

Make no mistake: cliches abound.  Favreau and company (there are eight credited screenwriters, not to mention the comic's creator) hit every major Western point; co-producer Ron Howard, in the bonus features, actually comments on how a good western strikes all of the major chords, which I would disagree with, but his fat wallet speaks louder than my empty checking account, so go figure.  (On a side note, it's interesting to hear John Favreau say that STAR WARS borrowed from western iconography; definitely gives some food for thought.)  Usually, cliches are a hindrance; when you're watching a film such as COWBOYS & ALIENS, you kind of expect them, and as such are willing to say, ""Okay, well, I saw this coming, so I can't complain much.""  That's not to say they're completely unnoticeable (note the lack of a star), but this is still a fun ride.

This film has two stars: the special effects and the actors.  The effects are great; nothing ground-breaking, but this film isn't meant to be.  It's just fun.  The aliens are freaky and interesting; the explosions are cool; the violence is surprisingly gory in spots (almost detrimentally so, but not quite).  The film's greatest strength, however, lies in its actors; Favreau has dotted his film with a bunch of talented character actors.  Daniel Craig has done this thing many times before, which simply means he's damn good at it: he's got the tough-guy wit down pat, and adds a bit of an emotional touch where required (Craig is, after all, one of the best actors on the scene right now, make no mistake).  Harrison Ford, too, has carved his niche, though he gets to push past this in a couple scenes: for a little while, you're actually afraid of him, as his character isn't necessarily a nice guy.  He's grossly underused, however; this is Craig's vehicle, not Ford's.  The same goes for Olivia Wilde; her character is interesting (if predictable), and the actress is clearly up for a challenge, but she never gets to do much.  The supporting cast features Sam Rockwell as a bartender/doctor bent on rescuing his wife; Clancy Brown as a tough-as-nails preacher; Keith Carradine as a kind-but-tough sheriff; and an especially-good Paul Dano as the younger Dolarhyde.

There are too many subplots that never get fully expanded; a whole lot of cliches that you see coming a mile away, and make no sense even within the context of the film; and everything runs on a bit too long.  But that's all okay.  Why?  Because COWBOYS & ALIENS is one of the few honest films to come out in recent years.  Check out its title: that's exactly what you get.  It's fun, plain and simple.  It won't win awards, and it doesn't deserve any.  It's meant to entertain, it's meant to excite the fanboy in you, and by God, it does that job admirably.",1323129600,,3906,4.712389380530974

4319017,4,B004BDOF1C,"I was quite skeptical about this movie. What were they thinking about mixing two completely unlike genres, cowboys, Apaches and aliens together? Well, my mistake. The end result is both a good western and a very credible sci-fi movie. So, out of an apparent weird mix came out an original movie under a plausible story line (Sorry, no spoiler, I will not go into the details of the plot).

I really liked the performance of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. All three main actors have in common to be associated with their roles in previous serial movies or TV series, where they played the lead or a key role. In this movie they managed to deliver a performance quite different from the character we are used to, particularly Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. I think this is her first key role other than ""House"" in which you can appreciate the quality of her acting. I hope she gets more opportunities like this to show us her talent.

As for the special effects, they are quite realistic, and it is notable that the insect-like aliens are not hidden with low lighting like in so many alien movies. The amazing thing is that the SFX are not based completely on computer animations (GCI). The film was shot using good old puppets and animatronics for the close-ups, combined with CGI for the battle scenes. Even some of the alien ships were scale models. My only quibble is that one of the alien features resembles a lot the character Kuato in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B000IHL52W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>&nbsp;(no spoiler again).

Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig do a great job but is not enough to keep you interested. if you think you're going to see an ""Independence Day"" ala Will Smith style you will be very very disappointed. that is what i thought and would have loved this movie to be but it's not. i give this movie 3 stars because its not complete trash and the actors did a great job and there is so much potential to the movie but it's worth a rent not a buy.",1322784000,2,897,4.167630057803469

It was much a corny western full of stereotypes and clich Western scenes something I am sure the scene writers intended. They put it together well, and the aliens with their planes and rockets made it intriguing. They made interesting alien characters and gave us a plot that kept you interested throughout.

The acting was very good, not surprising as both the two main characters Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are fine  actors, both played well. The characters were developed well.

I think the filming was good, not brilliant. The locations were filmed well and the special effects were good but again not brilliant.

As such I enjoyed it.

4319027,1,B004BDOF1C,"I'm very surprised at the positive reviews on here. I honestly thought the movie was pretty much everything wrong with the movie industry today. The name alone sounds like some hashed up SCI-FI B movie that should have went straight to VHS at best. To be fair though, I did watch the movie with hopes that it'll go against my ever nagging skepticism. To me I thought they should rename the movie Cowboys & [maybe SOME] Aliens because for almost half the movie, there were barely any encounters or rather I say quality scenes with the aliens and mind you, the aliens were your stereotypical bunch; sharp teeth, out to harm humans, ugly. Basically uncreative and definitely death to originality in every sense of the word. So half the movie felt like your typical cowboy movie and in the end, they have a small group of people that band together to fight the aliens in, mind you, a battle of very minute, nonepic, lackluster proportions. The movie wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't creative, it wasn't humorous, it wasn't witty, it just wasn't. Predictable from beginning to end.

So, what's so decent about this movie? Do I sense some mindless Harrison Ford worshipers or paid reviewers? I wouldn't watch this movie twice, so 23 bucks is definitely out of the question. To each their own, but you're giving the movie industry a bad message, basically ""go ahead and make bad movies, chances are we're just [FILL IN THE BLANK WITH NEGATIVE WORDS] to tell and will probably pay to watch it anyway"".

Amazon star ratings definitely should be held very loosely in terms of credibility. I hope everyone that gave this above 3 stars and above never become important people in real life, the future looks bleak.",1321747200,25,1698,4.752542372881356

Besides having two high quality actors (Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig) the plot was almost too simple for the average viewer and very corny.  I understand mixing the two genres of western movies and sci-fi flicks probably hasn't been done before but this wasn't the best way to go about doing it.  The aliens and their ships did seem pretty cool but theres very well done CGI in many other sci-fi movies plus they didn't show the aliens that clearly.  Olivia Wilde has been good in other movies but looked totally out of place and did a poor job of acting in this movie.  Overall though the plot, certain scenes in the movie, and poorly done scenery with CGI and the actors made it look to be a level right above ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" (A B-rated movie).

4319034,3,B004BDOF1C,"""Cowboys and Aliens"" is a fun movie, if not one that'll change your life in any noticeable way. The title pretty much tells you what the movie will be about. Still, it's been so long since we saw a cowboy movie-let alone cowboys who had thoughts that originated above the waist-that I was glad to see men (and woman) a-horseback again.

The movie starts with James Bond waking up in the desert, shoeless, yet accessorized by a really snazzy bracelet. Before he can even stand up, he's accosted by Newly from ""Gunsmoke"" who, with his not-too-well-coifed or overly bright sons, tries to take him in assuming the bracelet to be an indication of a prison break. Bond can't remember who he is, but he remembers how to fight and, soon, is riding into town in clothing furnished by Newly & Sons.

In the town he discovers that one of the Carradines is the remarkably upstanding sheriff, the preacher is a sincere but somewhat foul-mouthed person I probably should remember and the bar is run by Guy from ""Galaxy Quest"". If that weren't enough trouble, Mutt2 is terrorizing the town because his father, Indiana Jones, is rich and hard and takes in Apaches. The girl from ""Tron: Legacy"" is there, too, though it takes a long time to figure out why.

After the old west town is attacked by aliens--who lasso their victims and jerk them into the sky--Bond, Indy and the girl lead a posse of townies, outlaws and Indians into the New Mexico dessert to find them all. If this sounds confusing, it's not, really. But one thing it was, was unpredictable. In spite of the fact that I was thinking the title gave everything away, for the whole movie I never knew what was coming next. When I thought I knew, I was wrong. It turns out that the director who brought us ""Elf"" really knows how to tell a story.

I only have two quibbles with this movie. 1] there's too much foul language and it rarely ever serves the plot or the characters well. B] For all the writers of this movie (there are 5 listed and rumor has it many more could have been credited) I kept thinking how much better it could have been if Louis L'Amour had been around to write it.",1320019200,16,2132,4.473007712082262
4319035,4,B004BDOF1C,"Absolutely amazing! That's what I have to say about C&A, thus far I've taken critics and other reviewers like myself with a grain of salt because with films such as these you simply cannot take them seriously, why should this film have be any different? The acting was tremendous for those who do not know Daniel Craig he is English, so his accent is heavy more so then some Englishmen who have taken lead roles in American films. However this is quite different he plays a ""cowboy"", hardly anyone can pull that off correctly, a Englishmen to say the least (yet he did). His American accent as always was A+, but in this film its rougher, just like most western actors he really wanted to fit the part, and he did.

The Story, well many many viewers complain that the story is just ""stupid"", or ""simple"", so? Often we go to the movies and see a wonderful story, but we don't like the way it unfolds visually, other time's visuals and action or just acting alone makes a movie compelling yet we leave frustrated in the way the story itself unraveled. Beggars can't be choosers, this film I would categorize as a film that meets many qualifications that it really doesn't need (like a complete transformation from Craig as a charming ""Bond"" Englishmen to a rough American Cowboy)yet it lacks some qualities such as an undeveloped story (although I won't take a star off as it was based on a graphic novel).

All in all its fun, and like some of you who are giving this negative reviews, I to like a artsy film that makes me think, and other times I like a film such as Cowboys and Aliens, as it brings me joy as well, so why not?...Go Watch it! Have fun!",1319760000,,1652,4.430921052631579

There is a love story, lots of action, interesting relationships and a bit of an echo of John Wayne's ""Searchers"". If you don't like Sci-Fi or westerns, forget it.

4319037,1,B004BDOF1C,"This loud, crazy, genre mash-up brings together two iconic screen heroes in a mostly wasted opportunity to deliver a rugged, sun-drenched, violent western that's true to the best of this beloved American film tradition.  But no, the wonderful opening scenes that bring this 1870s era alive quickly jump the rails with a hodgepodge of sci-fi and other elements that throw almost everything into the mix.  There's even a dog.  There must be about a half dozen credited producers including Spielberg (has he no shame?) and at least as many credited writers.  From the looks of the finished film, I assume there are tidbits and moments of many more uncredited writers.  The resulting film is really the deal on screen - not a story.

Harrison Ford remains rather sullen throughout and Daniel Craig is mean and lean.  Sometimes their combined star power is startling - and other times it evokes laughter.  The latter I assume is not intentional as this is definitely not a comedy.  Perhaps that's the first mistake.  Neither is it a farce or satire.  Hard to tell what it is exactly other than a pulp sci-fi magazine cover from the 30s come alive.

John Favreau directs with a fine sense of the big vistas and ear-drum busting sound of the nicely visualized action scenes - even if it's not clear exactly what is going on at all times.  But all the disparate parts finally add up to a rather unsatisfying movie experience because the narrative itself is without a central thread that ties everything together.

That said, Olivia Wilde is a looker and on a blistering summer day Palm Springs, the movie was a welcome and cool respite from the heat.  And the cutting edge, blazing surround sound was so effective I was able to slurp my Slurpee without notice.",1319328000,13,1752,4.754966887417218
4319038,3,B004BDOF1C,"The film's title says it all ... well, most of it. Set in 1873 Arizona, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is about cowboys and aliens, or more precisely, about cowboys determined to rescue the townspeople from aliens. Based on a 2006 comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, a big-budget genre crossover (co-executive produced by Steven Spielberg) has two big names Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford (credited in this order).

Harrison Ford's character, an influential, iron-fisted cattleman Woodrow Dolarhyde, sets out to save his spoiled son Percy (Paul Dano) from monster-like creatures. Also, there is another cowboy in ""Cowboys & Aliens,"" Daniel Craig's lone cowboy with no memories of his past. He is a stranger in the small town of Absolution, where Dolarhyde virtually rules. Craig's role, reminiscent of young Clint Eastwood, is slightly bigger than Ford's. Ella, a mysterious woman played by Olivia Wilde, seems interested in this amnesiac gunman.

Part of the story reminds us of a John Ford classic ""The Searchers,"" and ""Cowboys & Aliens"" looks more like a western movie with sci-fi treatment, than a sci-fi film with a western twist. Director Jon Favreau, known for the ""Iron Man"" films, takes the idea of blending two genres seriously, and in ""Cowboys & Aliens"" he plays it very straight.

While it works to some extent, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" suffers from the weak storyline and underwritten characters. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford do their best, but their characters remain one dimensional. Supporting actors include Clancy Brown, Sam Rockwell and Keith Carradine, but they don't have much to do. Special effects are decent, but not really special. Action scenes are reasonably entertaining, but not very imaginative.

""Cowboys & Aliens"" is fairly entertaining movie, but considering the unique concept and the talented players involved in the project, this is a little disappointing.",1319241600,7,1875,5.281879194630872
4319039,5,B004BDOF1C,"Cowboys & Aliens barely grossed enough to cover its budget.  Almost all reviews I've read have been very negative.  Personally, I loved it!  Daniel Craig was definately the big star, followed by Olivia Wilde.  Harrison Ford's role was much smaller than I expected, and his costume (especially his cowboy hat that looked a lot like a fedora) made me see Indiana Jones in several scenes  :)

After the theatrical trailers I always avoid any information about movies, including the cast (I HATE spoilers).  Imagine my surprise when I saw Clancy Brown, the ultimate movie badass, playing the role of a preacher!

The show was almost sold out, & about two-thirds of the crowd looked to be in their 60s or older (nothing personal, of course).  Many say it's because the 1970s-90s generation just aren't as interested in westerns, which much of C&A is.  Whatever...I can't wait to see it again!",1318896000,5,887,4.8533333333333335

When I first saw the preview, it still seemed crazy, but giving a piece of alien technology to one of the cowboys seemed like a reasonable step to making this seem plausible....or at least as plausible as this scenario could be.

The movie started out very promising and reminded me of what I've loved from Westerns in the past....great, gritty character and plot development with the rebel cowboy standing up for the oppressed citizen, but only so far as he sees fit. Sadly, I felt like some of that strong plot and character development fell by the wayside once the aliens appeared. Instead we were filled with a lot of flash in the pan action sequences which were fun but not as compelling as I would've liked.

I really enjoyed both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in their roles. I especially loved the ""slow"" sequences with Harrison Ford as he interacted with some of his hired help or other cowboys searching for the aliens...one of my favorite scenes was when Harrison was talking with the young boy.

Overall, this movie didn't set me up to expect too much out of it...and sadly, that's all it delivered. It was fun, but not outstanding.

8. Demons will take your hard earned cash if you buy this movie, so wait until it shows for free on television.

This mix-up of the flinty cowboy movie genre immortalized by Clint Eastwood mated with a cheesy alien invasion a la ""Independence Day"" makes it difficult to decide whether it's supposed to be a comedy or an action movie, although there's plenty of material for both.

The first part of the movie is pretty good, but after that it's hard to decide whether you should laugh or cry. The cast is an excellent ensemble, and I guess this would be the main reason to go see or buy the movie.

An outstanding cast does not always make a great movie, as evidenced by the opening weekend box office figures that had this movie just barely passing ""The Smurfs"" for the top spot.

Essentially they were popcorn movies designed to entertain with fast paced action and I am very pleased to say that this Sci-Fi take on the genre is a heap of fun as well.

Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are great as the gruff and tough Westerners and the supporting task is fine too as assorted parsons, bartenders, sheriffs, outlaws and Apaches. It is refreshingly focused on the action, with the romantic elements very much played down. I enjoyed the fist-fights and the great scenery. The aliens are suitably villainous (you can tell they're bad even though they don't have black hats - or any other clothes for that matter), though they did appear a bit too super-powered for the standard Western weapons to deal with. Things are evened up of course with Craig's mysterious bracelet. He uses it liberally too. Indeed, no one really holds back and the climax is quite the kill-fest.

The film also has some blokey chuckles and some eye-candy in the lead actress. There are a couple of nice emotional touches at the end but the highlight for me was the full-blooded tone that was taken with the action. I was thoroughly entertained and if you go into the film, as a previous generation did to watch those earlier `Cowboys and Indians' actioners, you should have a great time too!",1314316800,2,1414,4.674698795180723

I was looking forward to this film for some time. It's been promoted in trailers and ads for some many months now. And it didn't disappoint. It certainly was better than Battlefield L.A, which was more or less a recruiting video for the army. Obviously, a cross-genre bending film like Cowboys and Aliens is always going to have believability issues. After all, six shooters and rifles, bows and arrows, Indian lances, and yes, a lariat, are going to seem a feeble offense against a race of evil aliens with interstellar technology. But it all comes together, sort of. And sort of is good enough. It never falls into campy, self-mockery. And that's all you can ask for.

So, bulldogging a space fighter is very improbable, even impossible, and it's doubtful there were outlaw gangs 50 member strong lurking in the Arizona Territory A few other improbabilities are  lurking about in this film as well.

But there is some very good acting going on here. It's always a pleasure to see Harrison Ford, and he makes the most of his role as the ex-army colonel turned Cattle Baron, Colonel Dolarhyde.
Daniel Craig made his big time actor bones reprising the screen action icon legend James Bond. He does a more than adequate job here. Harrison Ford brings some humanity to his role as the complex Colonel; at once caring and responsible, at other times ruthless and ice cold.
Olivia Wilde as the mysterious saloon girl plays an integral role here. She brings to all her work an air of inscrutability, leaving us wondering what lies behind that lovely visage. She conceals much, then when she reveals anything at all, its seems to be more of a revelation than it really is, in contrast to all her reticent air of mystery lead up.

Adam Beach as Nat Colorado, semi-adopted son of Colonel Dolarhyde, gives a subtle performance; He straddles the cultural divide, and plays second-fiddle to Dolarhydes pusillanimous heir, a sniveling coward and bully. The audience really enjoys his comeuppance at the hands of Jake Lonergen (Daniel Craig).
The Arizona Desert (really it was filmed in New Mexico) is one of the stars here. One of the most important features of any Western is the locale. Without it, the movie could be an Eastern!
The canyons, rock formations, long vistas stretching for miles; cowboys, Indians, vaqueros, Apaches, prospectors, saloon girls, outlaws, barkeeps, what have you. We need these western types. It's been awhile since the last western; I can't reckon just when the last one was..
But I had a hankering for a whole heaping bowl of the stuff; and in that case Podner, it;'s been too long! (I'm channeling a brand of chili meat for some reason).
""Cowboys and Alens"" came at the right time. Let's not quibble about believability and other such piddling stuff.

The direction's more than up to snuff. Remember along with the special effects in the film , there are things blowing up left and right, there are real horses and of course humans. John Favreau directed Iron Man, and also there was executive producer input as well from Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard. And the aliens were quite decent.

The plot is simple, although it has a couple unexpected twists. You won't walk away with your mind blown, but you also will have enjoyed the show.

As usual, the aliens, despite their vast technology, have a fondness for hand to hand combat. And, as usual, the aliens' motivation for invading Earth doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. Describing the bits and pieces doesn't describe this whole, though - it really has to be seen.

But, now that we've seen it, I'm left worrying about the inevitable imitators sure to try this recipe - with results ranging from dismal downwards.

4319064,3,B004BDOF1C,"At least one critic has suggested that ""Cowboys & Aliens"" should have been done as a comedy, like ""Men in Black,"" but the film wouldn't have been half as valuable if its creators had taken that approach.  Half of audiences seem to think it was unsuccessful anyway, apparently confused by the blending of a genre reputed to be harshly realistic and a genre known for its driven sprint from reality.  ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is an impressively smooth marriage of both genres, considering its straight-faced approach.

Like many newlyweds after the honeymoon, this marriage has left those involved a little disoriented: the script rarely seems confident in its direction, and there are a couple contrivances for the sake of convenience toward the end.  It's wisely simple, like so much of the best sci-fi, but creative, too, more creative than the ""Independence Day""-in-the-old-west ads have suggested.  It's more like a pulp sci-fi fantasy from the days of Edgar Rice Burroughs, if Larry McMurtry had been around to help.

Thank goodness for the bold-chested confidence of Jon Favreau's direction, which guides the film and inspires it to carry on, and have a good time doing so.  Favreau's jokester image post-""Swingers"" should now be shattered post-""Cowboys & Aliens"": he made ""Iron Man"" a surprise triumph, saved ""Iron Man 2"" from the meandering attention-deficit script resulting from a rushed production, and now he's shot ""Cowboys & Aliens"" with impressive steadyness and equal helpings of reserve and flair.  It's best when it recalls ""Unforgiven,"" although Favreau's tight panoramas have more color in them than any image from Clint Eastwood's film.  His sureness is the glue that holds together this strange narrative.  Its success is his own.

Daniel Craig plays the hero, an amnesiac with a bizarre bracelet.  Craig was cast for his resemblance to ""The Magnificent Seven""'s Yul Brenner.  He performs with a hoarse brashness and undercuttingly nasal American accent that would knock Brenner off his feet.  He's nowhere near as brash as Harrison Ford's domineering colonel-turned-cattle-rancher, possibly Ford's sole turn as a villain (the quality of his character in ""The Mosquito Coast"" is debatable).  Ford's performances seem to be growing increasingly delightful: first his left-field knockout performance in the awful ""Morning Glory,"" and now his deliciously devilish portrayal of a right American bastard (although, unfortunately, his character and thus his performance seems to have turned around at the film's end).  Ford may not have enough screen time to clearly be the jewel of the cast--but he is.

Olivia Wilde, who charmed in ""Tron: Legacy,"" charms here as well.  She's so charming that the audience seems to immediately clamor for Craig to forget the woman who starts him on his journey and fall for Wilde instead.  Paul Dano is also charming in the opposite way.  He's mastered the role of the contemptuous hypocrite, first in ""There Will Be Blood"" and now here.  He's on-screen for a total of no more than 10 minutes, but he makes an impression.

So does the film.  It's a soft impression, when it's over: it's surprisingly good, the kind of good that keeps one happy and entertained and even occasionally riveted during the course of the film, but also the kind of good that falls short of great and doesn't cry out for further investigation.  ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a simple film, despite the seemingly complex task of blending the science-fiction and western genres, but it's a good one.  It's pleasant and satisfying entertainment.",1312329600,3,3554,5.160558464223386

The Review:

Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford lead the cast of this science fiction western action epic and despite the crazy mixing of film genres, it's a good movie. Daniel Craig established himself as one of the most dynamic action stars of this decade when he was cast as the new James Bond in Casino Royale. Craig brought a unique, rougher edge and dynamism to the Bond role and carries that edginess over to his role as Jake Lonergan. Lonergan is an amnesiac anti-hero trying to solve the mystery of his lost memory as well as get to the bottom of the strange device attached to his wrist. Harrison Ford, despite being well into his sixties, still kicks butt as Woodrow Dolarhyde, Civil War veteran turned ornery cattle rancher. Ford's performance is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's performance in The Unforgiven. That's to say Dolarhyde has lost a few steps over the years, but has fought many more battles than the younger Jake Lonergan played by Craig. Dolarhyde has his share of character flaws, and apparently so does Lonergan. Craig shares the spotlight quite well with Ford, who is a legendary Hollywood action star.

Cowboys & Aliens` plot is summed up by its title. As I try and put into writing why cowboys are fighting aliens the silliness of it all becomes apparent, but more is the fool anyone going to a movie with the words cowboys and aliens in the title expecting the next Memento. The cliff notes, and spoiler free version is that a hostile alien race is kidnapping humans ahead of their planned, full scaled invasion of earth. The aliens possess vastly superior technology to the barely industrialized Americans of the latter half of the nineteenth century. This simple set up sets the stage for some great action and a few nice plot twists. The movie never gets too bogged down in character development. We get just enough of Jake Lonergan's past via flash back's so that we can see his character's evolution from anti-hero to plain hero. Lonergan's moral development is highlighted by the inclusion of the town preacher played by Clancy Brown, who makes clear early on that he's ""seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.""

By film's end, you'll be treated to every type of action scene except a car chase. It threatens at times to be a bit much for any other movie without cowboys and aliens in the title. It's perfect summer movie fodder. It's great fun, with an uncomplicated plot, but simplicity works in its favor and it's greatly helped by the fact that it boasts two incredible talents in Craig and Ford. Recommended for anyone who wants to tune out and just enjoy a great action movie with a unique, if somewhat offbeat premise -- basically those of us who think a western would benefit from the presence of hostile extraterrestrials. In other words, those amongst us who like a little Cowboys with their aliens, or is that aliens with their cowboys? You get the idea.

4319066,1,B004BDOF1C,"With a hokey name like ""Cowboys and Aliens"", you're really not supposed to expect much more than Cowboys and Aliens, fighting.

And very little of the movie even deals with that.  For an action/adventure film, there's remarkable little action and no real adventure.

Being PG-13, it couldn't go all-out in a faithful depiction of the Old West, but it seems they only really pushed it so as to show off Olivia Wilde's buttcrack and a quick shot of a a guy with a big hole shot through the chest with an alien weapon, as everything else is virtually squeaky-clean, not a hint of racism or sexism, grit or grime, and an utterly blas attitude from everyone but Sam Rockwell as the bartender ""Doc"".

As the review in my local newspaper said, very little is devoted to ""why"" with regards to the alien, and far too much ""why"" with regards to Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan, played so stony and cold you don't give a damn about any of his problems.

The characters are horribly one-dimensional and predictable, and there were so many instances in the film where not only me, but a large group of people, burst out laughing.  And not when the movie was being funny.

Not going to spoil it, but the big ""revelation"" moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater, and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed, it provoked chitters and groans.

For a movie that felt so long and, by concept, seemed to be aiming for something big, it sure felt small, like a Syfy original movie with some big-name actors in it.

But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people.  Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people, but as it turns out, their ultimate reason for coming to Earth, and their goal, not only has little to nothing to do with humans, but considering their technology, they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all!

Considering how a clich'd Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason.  But then we wouldn't have this big dumb mess we call a movie.",1312243200,25,2312,4.61219512195122
4319067,4,B004BDOF1C,"""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a film with a simple plot with a few surprises. It takes place a few years after the Civil War and Harrison Ford is still complaining about the Union generals at Antietam, as well as having to deal with a spoiled, drunken son. Daniel Craig has amnesia and a strange bracelet clamped on his wrist. And Olivia Wilde is a beautiful, gun-toting woman who seems to know what's going on with Craig, as alien spacecraft start blowing up a town and the area's cowboys, and later robbers and Apaches. The film meanders along for quite some time, but heats up in the second half, as humans band together to try to save humanity from extinction.

""Cowboys & Aliens"" has some good action sequences and photography, and the aliens are ugly and scary. The main actors all do a good job, as does Keith Carradine as a sheriff and Sam Rockwell as a non-violent saloon owner who learns to shoot a rifle.

All in all, this is a well-made film, which is generally entertaining, especially in its latter stages. Three and one-half stars.",1312243200,58,1038,4.575268817204301

4319069,5,B004BDOF1C,"This was a fun movie.  It was made more so by the restrained hand of the scriptwriter and the selective care of the director.  While it was an extremely improbable plot, and it would certainly have lent itself to complete kitsch or camp, it didn't seem to wander that direction at all.  It was played almost entirely straight like a classic western (a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Noon-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00006JMRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Noon (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Seven-Special-Edition/dp/B000059TFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shane/dp/0792163710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shane</a>) with just enough humor to break the tension in order to rekindle it to new heights later in the film.  Shakespeare would have been proud--Heck, Shakespeare would have had fun with the concept had it occurred to him!

The story partakes of a bit of both sci-fi and the western, creating a sort of ""what if?"" ambiance.  It pits the grit of late 19th century Southwesterners intent on reclaiming their family memebers, dead or alive, or die trying against a higher tech race of aliens bent on taking over the planet--or at least its gold supply.  Though the weapons of the former are primitive by comparison to their enemies, their ability to bury their differences and risk their lives for a common goal is their strong suite.  Furthermore, it is ultimately not their vulnerability that counts but that of their alien enemies.  The aliens are at base no more immortal or immune to harm than humans are, and their apparent contempt for humans proves their undoing.

The use of CGI in the film was admirably restrained.  In short it was never introduced to the point where it dominated the screen or the live actors on it.  The animated characters were there as the ""bad guys,"" not to impress us with the quality of computer graphics---with which even the elderly are probably more than familiar by now.

The primary heroes were all consummate actors; Harrison Ford, who is very used to the concept of animation and blue screen techniques, seemed especially comfortable in his role, and Danial Craig was wonderful.  His deadpan affect was just what was needed in the role of anti-hero pressed into the service of mankind by circumstances.  I also appreciated the director's take on a well shaped derri&egrave;re framed by leather chaps!  The heroine, Olivia Wilde, was mysterious and engaging; her placement in a role of self sacrifice was moving; so often it is a male character that makes the ultimate sacrifice for human kind, making it seem as though women are either unwilling or incapable of doing so.  It was a good choice.  So was the fact that she did not return to give the film a standard ""happy ending.""  Again a remarkable sense of restraint in a film that could have gone way over the top.

In all an entertaining film.",1312243200,6,3097,5.591006423982869
4319070,4,B004BDOF1C,"When this film was in production, I was very excited for it. The reason was because of the interesting theme of Cowboys mixed with Aliens. Who better to be Executive Producer than Steven Spielberg, the king of alien films. Also, on the Cowboy side, you have acting legend Harrison Ford, who wonderfully portrays a Cowboy. With Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci doing the Screenplay, I had no doubts that ""Cowboys & Aliens"" would at very least be interesting.

For a general plot summary, the film begins with Daniel Craig's character (Jake Lonergan) waking up in the middle of the dessert, with a steel bracelet on his arm. He wonders into the nearest town, where he discovers that mysterious, alien-like spacecrafts have been taking people and his bracelet is the only weapon that damages the Aliens.
Meanwhile, rich cattle owner Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) discovers the aliens have captured his son, so Lonergan and himself lead an attack on the Alien base.

Action, right --a couple of guns fire-- Oh boy, that's exciting. . .but Dad also loved Kubrick's 2001. . .

I, on the other hand, was mesmerized by Star Wars' aesthetic (excepting the horribly edited Return Of The Jedi, the first misstep), and entranced by Ridley Scott's exceptional and visually arresting Alien. That was my time and represented my sensibilities on film. Westerns? Please.

Now I'm in my early 50's and I've only recently re-discovered Eastwood's not-edited-for-60's-TV spaghetti westerns. Yes, I think I now understand why Dad so enjoyed those movies with their alternating boldness and slinking subtlety. It has something to do with the appeal of shedding modern-age trappings in favor of the simplicity that a good horse and a reliable six-shooter can provide. Still, I'm entertained by the SciFi fantasies of Robocop and District 9, too.

One dimensional characters that gain substance as the movie progresses, remembrance of love and glancing hints of what might be, a grand moment of thwarted alien retribution, but more than anything it's the overall tone of the film that binds it together, and with great satisfaction.

""Cowboys and Aliens"" is a unique mixture of western and science fiction.

4319074,5,B004BDOF1C,"I know it sounds a little bizarre, but this is a Sci-Fi movie where the Aliens attack Cowboys.  Set amidst the desert, magnificent rock formations and canyons of New Mexico, this 2011 release was a hoot!  There is plenty of CGI and action, with Daniel Craig (James Bond 007, etc.) and Harrison Ford (Star Wars, etc.).  This is a good one to see on the big screen with full sound.

The 2 hour and 13 minute movie opens with Jake Lonegan/Daniel Craig coming to in the desert.  He does not know who he is or what happened to him.  He is wearing a wide metal armband that he cannot remove, has no boots, and he has a significant wound in his side.  Three men and a dog ride up to him and the men are not very hospitable.  But, not to worry--Jake kicks their collective backsides and rides off with a horse, boots, a change of clothes, and the dog.  In a nearby small town, he finds help with his wound, meets some folks, and renews some acquaintances.  We realize quickly that Jake can take care of himself, too.

Also in town, Jake finds out his name, and that he is wanted for murder, mayhem, and a bunch of other stuff.  We find out the town is practically owned by Harrison Ford, the cattleman whose money puts meat on everyone's table.  We also meet Ford's arrogant son, Percy.  Daddy's power and money have obviously gone to Percy's head.  And, we also meet the Aliens, as they begin a seek and destroy mission that grabs a good number of the town's people and takes them away.  Ford and Lonegan and other town folk head out on horseback to see if they can find out what is going on.  Oh yeah, there is a pesky woman following Lonegan, too.

I actually saw this movie Friday night.  I loved it so much that when my little boy (age 38) wanted to see it today, back I went!  It was enjoyable and high-action.

Note to parents--there is plenty of violence.  Scenes of Aliens grabbing folks and taking them away, Aliens ripping into people with their long ugly fingers, opening folks up, biting through them, and taking out their organs may be sufficient to scare your young children.  So, unless you want them sleeping in your bed until they are 35, you might want to re-think taking them to the movie.  If you plan to see this in the theater, you may want to reconsider bringing an infant, too.  This movie has a lot of loud noise with the shooting and fighting scenes--a little excessive for a baby.  (Yes, there was one in the theater tonight, and it kept crying.)",1311984000,9,2466,4.364835164835164
4319075,3,B004BDOF1C,"A movie with a title and a premise this goofy had better at least deliver some fun, so I will give Cowboys & Aliens a little credit in that department. I had really been looking forward to this crazy sounding genre mashup. Even with the mostly negative reviews, I still had hope.

My main issues are with the weak story and just a general lack of amazement from any of the CGI and action sequences. The plot is just your typical western for the first 30 minutes or so (which was the best part), until the aliens show up. Then the cowboys become friends with some indians and they must combine resources to fight the aliens. That about sums it up. If you see a movie called Snakes on a Plane or Cowboys & Aliens, don't expect anything other than that. The visuals are not bad, they just didn't show us anything new or inventive. Well, I guess you could count the sight of a dude on horseback from the 1800's being chased by an alien spacecraft as something new.

Daniel Craig is pretty good as the Charles Bronson like character. Mostly silent but deadly in an instant. Harrison Ford is okay as a gruff and tough cowboy, even though he was not always believable. Olivia Wilde is here to look at and Sam Rockwell is wasted, though he does have a couple of good lines.

There is not really more to say about a movie this basic. I hope this decline presented in both Iron Man 2 and Cowboys & Aliens does not continue for Jon Favreau.",1311984000,,1429,4.324626865671642
