3714929,1,B000NA26YA,"This DVD drops in 2025?  Isn't a seventeen year preorder a bit long?  Won't DVDs be collectors items by then?  Well I guess if I survive the Rise of the Machines, the Clone Wars, the melting of the ice caps, and the Clinton2 presidency I can look forward to Nicotina.",1187136000,3,267,4.3
3714930,4,B000NA26YA,"""Nicotina"" is yet another fast-paced, crime thriller inspired heavily by Tarantino.  Although ""Nicotina"" doesn't add anything particularly new to this genre of crime films (which includes ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Sexy Beast"", and ""Snatch"",), its scattered traces of originality prevent it from being too derivative.  Anything but subtle, the director Hugo Rodriguez often superimposes graphics within the picture to make sure the audience doesn't miss any key details.  Rodriguez also makes his presence known by placing two screen shots on the screen side-by-side.  It's as if Rodriguez is taking the viewer by the lapels and saying, ""look at this!""  While the actual plot may not deserve such attention, the director's enthusiasm rubs off and keeps ""Nicotina's"" pace driving forward.  The recurrent focus on people's relationships with smoking gives an otherwise disjointed movie some thematic unity.  A fun film for lovers of its genre.",1116633600,4,931,5.560283687943262

8325467,3,B000NA26YA,"A Spanish movie of punishing the bad at the beginning of a third millennium presents already a bit out-dated computer used to spying over sexy neighbour and hacking Swiss banks by a geek looking rather infantile and asexual.

8325468,2,B000NA26YA,"The movie is not bad but the DVD transfer sucks.  I would give the movie four stars, zero for DVD quality.  The main feature, six trailers, and two language tracks are all on a single-layer disk (4.7GB) with a lot of room to spare, so the bit rate must be extremely low.",1330560000,,270,4.173076923076923

8325470,3,B000NA26YA,"Nicotina: 5 out of 10: Nicotina represents a black comedy tradition that has been alive and well in Mexico for over fifty years. The tradition is that death is around every corner and it is a punch line. In this tradition, the men are often womanizers while the women are often just as naughty. Director Hugo Rodrguez and Writer Martn Salinas took this beloved tradition and married it to its distant cousin, the Quentin Tarantino crime film.

It is a decent fit. The basic plot is that a Mexican criminal gang is trading computer bank codes for diamonds with a Russian gang. I do not think I am spoiling anything by pointing out that not everything goes as planned. The two criminal gangs end up involving the computer geek that downloaded the data. His next door neighbor, a sexy and promiscuous cellist, played by Marta Belaustegui; her conductor, a potential sugar daddy: a plant toting upstairs neighbor: a pharmacist couple, with a beautiful saintly wife played admirably by Carmen Madrid: and a beauty shop couple, with an evil harridan wife played chillingly by Rosa Mara Bianchi: plus the occasional police officer and a scary dog.

Some of the camera tricks can be fancy without any underling purpose, and I have not seen this much pastel neon on buildings, since that Don Johnson episode of True Hollywood Stories. Overall, however the film is nice. It is a pleasant, good time. It is not particularly scary, thrilling, funny, sexy, or clever and that is it's only real fault. There is nothing terrible memorable in the ninety odd minutes of movie.

Oh and do not watch if you are trying to quit smoking. I have never seen a movie so relentless in its promotion of tobacco. It is like watching Eat Drink Man Woman while trying to diet,",1248912000,,1746,4.718032786885246
