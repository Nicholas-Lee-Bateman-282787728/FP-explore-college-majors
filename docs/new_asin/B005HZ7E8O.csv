8474012,1,B005HZ7E8O,"I have nevere seen a 3D movie that looks like it was taken with a $100 camera.  Totally terrible and a total waste of money.  Had I known that it was produced by total amateurs, I would have never bought it.  I feel scammed.",1330992000,6,224,4.045454545454546

A few friends (not actors by any stretch of the imagination) got together with a video camera and tried to make a buck.  I don't know how they did the 3D, but it looks like a single hand held video camera.  A complete waste of $15!",1324512000,10,321,4.145161290322581
