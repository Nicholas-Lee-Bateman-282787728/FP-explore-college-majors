1977023,4,B00018U9FW,"I thought this was a surprisingly good movie.  Jack Black plays his enthusiastic rock and roll self, much better I think than his older attempts at romantic lead or cynic.  His unique take on most  topics contrasted well with the preppy fifth-graders he was matched with.  I thought the chemistry of all of the characters was great, and that Joan Cusack was great as the principal. Definitely time wellspent in the theater.",1065225600,,423,4.833333333333333

1977117,5,B00018U9FW,"This is a great little movie.  What makes it so, is that there is comedy here involving a bit of subterfuge and obsession with being a musician on the part of Jack Black's character, Dewey.  But the comedy doesn't rely on forced gags, bathroom humor or uncomfortable moments (which I generally don't find humorous), it relies on Black's likeable but preposterous character who remains unabashedly focused on doing his thing and accomplishing his goal in the face of whatever arises in his path, by using whatever charm, wit, fraud or heart he can muster to make his dream happen.  Other top humorous moments come from kids being kids of all different kinds and Dewey dealing with them, and in some ways Dewey is more of a kid than any of them, but he has a good heart and passion, and he ends up really caring about the kids.  I have no reservations about my 10 year old watching this, and he and my 13 year old boy loved it.",1509235200,,925,4.455621301775148

Jack Black is always grubbily hilarious; Joan Cusack gets to do more than just stand around for a change. The only serious flaws are the predictable adherence to which sex plays what (white boy virtuoso guitarist, girls sing back up) and Sarah Silverman wasted in a conventional shrew of a girlfriend role.

1977453,4,B00018U9FW,"I've never given Jack Black much thought.  Although he's been around movies and television for the past few decades, he started mostly in minor or supporting roles, where I hardly noticed him.  Then there were the voice characterizations in various screen animations, which I enjoyed; some wholly forgettable starring parts in things like ""Shallow Hal,"" ""Nacho Libre,"" and ""Gulliver's Travels""; his leading role in the ""King Kong"" remake, where he reminded me of a young Orson Welles; and this 2003 film, ""School of Rock,"" which is still probably my favorite Jack Black vehicle.

""School of Rock"" gives Black a chance to do what he does best:  Be a chubby, manic, warmhearted, unpredictable wild man in the John Candy, John Belushi mold.  The surprising thing to me is that Richard Linklater directed the movie, surprising because I usually think of Linklater as a filmmaker of more subtle tastes, doing things like ""Before Sunrise,"" ""Before Sunset,"" ""Fast Food Nation,"" ""Waking Life,"" ""A Scanner Darkly,"" and ""Bernie.""  But then I remembered he also made ""Dazed and Confused,"" another film about school life that was raucous, truthful, and heartfelt.  Apparently, he's a more successfully eclectic filmmaker than I recalled.

In ""School of Rock"" Black plays Dewey Finn, a dedicated rocker, a guy for whom music is life.  It's just that he's not a very good musician, and he's too much of an egotistical scuzzball to recognize how destructive he can be.  As a result, his band has voted to kick him out and replace him with someone more sensible.  What's more, Dewey hasn't paid his rent to old friend and roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White, who wrote the film) in months, and Schneebly's rigidly uptight girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) wants Ned to kick him out of the apartment.  What's poor Dewey to do?

Dewey hits upon a scheme.  Ned is a substitute teacher and gets a call for a job one day at a prestigious, private, upper-class elementary prep school; Dewey takes the call and accepts the job for himself, needing the money and pretending to be Ned.  But he hasn't a clue how or what to teach in a classroom full of ten and eleven-year olds.  So he decides to teach them the only thing he knows, rock and roll, and organize them into a classroom band.

You can guess the rest as he prepares the kids to participate in a Battle of the Bands contest, all the while trying to hide from the school's principal, the ultraconservative Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack), the fact that he's not really a teacher.

Naturally, Dewey learns as much about himself from the kids as he teaches them about rock-and-roll music.  This is Jack Black front and center at all times, and his extrovert personality works perfectly for the part.  He makes the kids feel important, and they help restore his self-confidence.  Dewey even throws in some rock history and rock appreciation in his teaching, which is kind of cute, considering it as a metaphor for how little young people know anything about their own culture.

The movie has a few slow spots in it but otherwise displays a strong forward momentum, again thanks to Black.  More important, though, it's funny, Black is tiptop, and the kids are appealing, not precious.  It's a high-energy movie and a joyous one, too, with a soundtrack filled with great old tunes from the likes of Kiss, the Clash, Cream, the Doors, AC/DC, The Who, The Ramones, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Stevie Nicks, T-Rex, Velvet Underground, and a slew of others.

Video:
Using an MPEG-4/AVC codec and a dual-layer BD50, the Paramount video folks give us a picture quality that probably looks about as good as I imagine the original print to look.  There are no obvious signs of their tinkering with the image, no filtering or edge sharpening, no halos, no glossiness, nothing but a clean screen, a little inherent print grain, good object delineation, realistic colors, and especially lifelike facial hues.

Audio:
Surprisingly, the soundtrack doesn't offer all that much surround activity, mostly just a good front-channel stereo spread.  The engineers use lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, but maybe because a lot of the material they reproduced was in two-channel, not much in the rears came through they were willing to enhance.  Anyway, expects lots of rock music surrounding even more dialogue, the rock clear and dynamic, the dialogue sounding quite natural.

Extras:
The extras begin with two separate commentaries, one with star Jack Black and director Richard Linklater and the other a ""Kids' Kommentary"" with seven of the young actors and actresses in the film.  After those, we get a twenty-five minute making-of featurette, ""Lessons Learned on School of Rock,"" with the stars and filmmakers; ""Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin,"" about two minutes, in which Black teasingly begs the band to use one of their songs; a ""School of Rock"" music video; an eight-minute ""Kids' Video Diary:  Toronto Film Festival""; a sixteen-minute featurette, ""MTV's Diary of Jack Black""; and an interactive text feature, ""Dewey Finn's History of Rock.""

The extras conclude with eighteen scene selections; bookmarks; a widescreen theatrical trailer in HD; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Sure, ""School of Rock"" is a predictable fantasy, but it's also great fun.  It's like one of those inspirational sports movies where you want to stand up and cheer at the end.  More to the point, I found any number of laughs in it.  I mean, what do you want from a comedy?",1434758400,3,5568,4.980540540540541

1977579,4,B00018U9FW,"I cant say that Im a big fan of Jack Black, but the few things Ive seen him in, Ive enjoyed. From Kung Fu Panda to High Fidelity, to the Tenacious D albums, he seems to like doing what he does and doesnt try to be anything hes not. School of Rock was one of those movies that Id always see portions of when it was on tv, and something would always come up to make me miss out on the rest of it. After finally watching it from start to finish tonight, I gotta say that this movie goes by in a flash, and is one of the more enjoyable films Ive seen in a long time. It may not be perfect, but it kept me smiling, nodding along to the music, and even getting worried a couple of times about when something was going to happen. In the off-chance that you haven't seen School of Rock yet, you definitely should if you like school movies or need a course in whats now considered classic rock.

Dewey Finn plays guitar in a band, and is quite a ham on stage. Long solos, tons of movement, moving in on the lead singers microphone to shout a few lines, he does it all. Things aren't working out in his favor though, and hes behind on rent by over 2k. His roommate, Theo, used to play in another band with Dewey, and left that life to be with his girlfriend who wears the pants in the relationship. She gives him a little time to make up for the months rent, and if he cant get the money, hes out. After his own band kicks him out, Deweys chances of making any money start to look even worse. And yet one day when he answers the phone, a school says they need a substitute teacher immediately. Thats Theos job, but hes not home at the moment. So who steps in, knowing that Theo makes some decent money each week? Bingo. Dewey assumes Theos name and ends up teaching a bunch of 10 year olds at a very uppity private school. At first he has zero interest in teaching them anything, until he sees them in music class, and sees a lot of potential in each of them. And with a big Battle of the Bands show coming up where the winning band brings in some serious cash, Dewey has a plan.

As stupid (and even cliche) as the plot may sound, it works. The majority of the time is spent in the classroom, with Dewey spending a lot of time with each student, going over things like performance aesthetics, playing with emotion, and putting together a song in just a couple of minutes and giving it some oomph. The kids are all well-behaved for the most part, but theres a lot of pent-up energy that needs to be let out. Theyre too restricted at home, always doing things as part of a schedule and Dewey changes all of that. He manages to have a nice setup in the classroom for music, from soundproofing the room to setting up cameras in the hallways so they can move everything into storage if the principal is on the way to check on the class. For me, the best thing about the movie is that the class feels like a real class in this setting. Theres no one wild and crazy kid, no most popular, no street kid, none of that. If there were any of those character types, this would be an entirely different movie. The films second biggest strength is Jack Black in the lead role. He goes from slacker to a great music teacher in no time, and you can tell that his character really cares about the kids. Hes never doing it all just for the money after he gets to know the kids. He wants everyone to succeed and be their own person- not who their teacher or parents want them to be. This is the kind of person most kids would want as their teacher, for any subject. You can tell all the kids know what they're doing music-wise too, and most importantly, they're having fun. When you see one of the kids smile while playing keyboards because hes told hes awesome, its a real smile. It also wouldnt surprise me if most of what Jack Black said to the kids during performances wasn't scripted.

The one semi-big thing I have against the movie is how far Dewey goes before anyone become suspicious. Every time the class would practice right there in the classroom, Id start to get worried myself that theyd be caught and itd be over for Dewey. I won't spoil what happens, though I will say when things start to get very bad, it isn't handled at all like how it would in the real world. I think they could have done better here, and at the same time, it might have completely changed the tone of the movie, so Im 50/50 on it.

I really enjoyed this movie. It never drags on, has some good laughs, sports a great soundtrack, and apart from then-state of the art Apple computers, doesnt date itself. School of Rock is one of the few school movies Ive seen that could be watched by anyone of any age, and theyd find something to like about it. The people wholl get the most out of it will probably be musicians and parents who have kids, and were around in the 60s and 70s to enjoy a few of the bands featured here. School of Rock is rad, plain and simpleeven if they completely wasted Amy Sedaris in a part that lasted all of 10 seconds. Watch it when you get a chance.",1415750400,2,5033,4.190918472652219

1977585,4,B00018U9FW,"""School of Rock"" isn't a great movie, but it's sweet-natured and fun. Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, a local would-be guitar hero who's had a run of setbacks. The rock band he founded has just expelled him. His housemate's girlfriend wants to evict him for not paying his rent. Dewey impersonates his housemate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), in order to make some quick cash as a substitute teacher. Dewey brings a decidedly unconventional curriculum to the fifth grade at posh Horace Green School, an institution somewhere in the suburbs of Manhattan that is filled with  the pressure-cooked offspring of overachieving parents who have the principal (Joan Cusack) terrified of any deviation from conventional success. Dewey sees some of the kids have musical talent. He instigates a ""class project"" to get the kids ready for a local Battle of the Bands competition featuring himself as lead vocalist. Black offers enthusiastic love for classic rock standards, zeal for subverting the misguided application of authority, and real warmth in his interactions with the kids. ""School of Rock""'s jolly everybody-in-the-pool vibe kept our family laughing.",1412208000,,1145,5.3259668508287294

Of course, Dewey has no idea how to teach - and after a while, he and his students are bored to death with ducking the assigned curriculum and just sitting around the classroom. So Dewy starts talking to his kids about rock and roll and they respond with great enthusiasm. Encouraged, Dewey brings in his favorite classic rock albums and videos.

1977861,4,B00018U9FW,"For this review, I'm assuming you have seen the movie (otherwise, why buy the dvd) and are considering owning a copy.

This is a fine DVD. It is not HD or Blue Ray, but it plays and looks great on my blue ray player.
There is really nothing wrong with the copy, and for that alone this would get 5 stars. But I rate dvds on their bonus material, especially the commentary, since this is where the added value is for me.  And in this aspect, I think the value could be higher. The commentary was very half-assed. I don't mind the commentators goofing off or even digressing wildly - often this provides valuable insights into these personalities. But I expect a certain amount of discussion of the film, its production, the development of the story, the actors' interpretation of and improvisation with their roles, etc. The commentary section was very mediocre. Not bad, just not great. Hence 4 stars. If I was rating just the commentary, It'd be 2 stars.

The redeeming qualities come with the many other special features: the kids have a commentary track, and the kids have a video diary of the showing of School of Rock at the Toronto film festival; there is a fun music video of a song one of the kids (in the story line), and other such features. I found the kid stuff really fun. So many of them were so delightful in the film, it was great to get a sense of their real personalities.

(for the 11th time) so he was nt happy about it. i sat out of sight and watched his face as he became more gripped by seeing ""kids""...then...even as a filipino...with limited english...his face just kept cracking a UNCERTAIN smile constantly. a bit out of his league....even he knew it was supossed to be funny. in closing....i try very hard to NOT waste time on a-hole movies...(which there are plenty of these days) just listen to me....grab a piece of the sofa....and let the whole family in on this one.

Black is very good (for what it is) in this role. In the back story in special features, the director said he wrote this for Jack Black, specifically. Very few actors could have done as good in this part as Black. In real life, Black is an accomplished musician, and, I believe a nice guy that is still a kid at heart. That really comes across in this movie. And there are laughs. And the music is good.

However, now that I've sat down and watched as much of the movie as I could (while taking bathroom breaks and such) I must say it was hella worth it! School Of Rock is a funny, relatable and heartwarming film about big dreams, taking chances and having fun. Jack Black is your typical ""loser"" who is in a band that is going nowhere financially. Everyone tells him that he should take life more seriously and get a real job. So he does--as his friend! He applies for a job at a private prep school for young kids and instead of teaching them the basic subjects most schools teach he engulfs them in a pure rock music frenzy! He unleashes the inner Freddie Mercury and Tina Turner in all of the boys and girls in the classroom.

Throughtout the movie he gives each of them roles in the band and some of the members even learn self-confidence and to get along better with their fellow classmates. It really is a great movie and one that I would hate to see negative reviews about simply because I thought it was an awesome guilty pleasure.

Enjoyable to the brim.

1977997,5,B00018U9FW,"In high school, I must have rented this movie countless times from Netflix. It was my absolute favorite movie, but then I kinda forgot about it for a while when I ultimately fell off of movies a bit. That was, until I realized I had forgotten to bring my own movie to watch during my most recent blood platelet donation. I simply HAD to watch it again, hoping it would recapture at least some of the magic it had for me as a high schooler. I'm happy to say it didn't recapture SOME of the magic; rather, it recaptured every bit of it. But you may ask, why do I still love this movie so much?

Well, for one, it makes great use of some of my favorite music of all time. Songs by iconic bands such as AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, The Ramones, The Who and Cream (among others) help add the appropriate musical assistance to an already phenomenal and somewhat heart-warming story. Jack Black plays arguably the most appropriate role for him (outside of Tenacious D at least). Personally, I would kill to have him as my substitute teacher. The writing in the movie, and the overall plotting, are very well played out; it never drags, and it isn't laden with predictability. The writers of this movie definitely knew what they were doing in terms of making a movie about rock 'n' roll.

The kids in the movie are absolutely precocious and phenomenal. They have actual CHARACTER to them rather than just being cute, and all the ones who perform with the band are ACTUALLY playing and singing, both during the music class scene and during the rock band practice. No autotune, no air guitar, no lip synching, no ghost keyboards... it's all natural. And the song the band plays at the Battle Of The Bands competition is a phenomenal anthem that deserved to be a smash hit, honestly. Finally, the best thing about this movie: it teaches kids who may see it a bit of history of some REAL music. Forget about today's scene, tripe like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber and the Jonas Brothers are topping the charts and it's depressing. This movie gives kids insight onto when music was not about corporate sellouts like them, but about one thing and one thing only: REBELLION, sticking it to ""the man"" (a common phrase throughout the movie) rather than giving in to what ""the man"" wants you to do.

The bottom line is that for a rock 'n' roll history lesson, a great story, and a chance to watch some kids really show what they have as musicians, then this movie is perfect. It's still held up for me after all these years.",1312243200,,2498,4.485714285714286
1978018,5,B00018U9FW,"Well, not literally. But for the last decade, if I'd been watching a comedy, chances are it was this.

Jack Black is not to everyone's taste, and I can understand that. I'm personally a big fan, though I acknowledge that he works best in certain films. But Black's clear love for rock and roll shines through the whole time.

Had this film been more poorly written, I would have complained about how creepy it is that Black's character - Dewey Finn - was exploiting these kids. But thankfully, both the film and its main character are aware of the irresponsibility of what's going on. Knowing that this something that can't last is a big part of the emotional investment as you're waiting for the house of cards to come tumbling down on Dewey and the kids.

This film was my introduction to rock and, yes, it's no college primer, but looking back the film has all sorts of little references, some of which might miss even moderate rock fans, that clearly mark the energy that went into the film.

One thing I loved was about how there is basically no villain in the movie. The kids are unmotivated, but talented and creative; the principal is a stickler for rules, but secretly yearns to break free of them; even Finn's nemesis, played by Sarah Silverman, is perfectly in the right to treat Finn with contempt. I loved that the film fights the idea of establishment more than it does the people within it; both the principal and the parents come to see the students in a new light, rather than being ""punished"".

The other thing I loved was how none of the characters become ""famous"" in the end, which is something else a more poorly written film would have done. The kids and Dewey feel rewarded just for having discovered their own passions and talents - and for all the emotion they give it at the end, you'd be convinced that they won a million dollars.

It would be disingenuous of me to claim that this is either the funniest comedy or the most cerebral, but it's certainly one of the most enthusiastic. Everyone feels like they're having a wonderful time, and I couldn't help but be dragged along by it. This is a comedy I'd recommend to any self-respecting teen.",1310515200,,2170,4.551282051282051

But you're not watching this for the philosophy. You're watching it for the humor, and possibly for Jack Black. You will get some good doses of that, although probably nothing will rival Nacho Libre.

The reason I can't give it more stars is, it's terribly disturbing to see young children using language and dressing in skimpy clothes. I wouldn't let a child do something that.

It's reasonably funny, and I love Joan Cusack's acting. Jack Black did a fine job although, like I said, he can probably never rival himself as he was in Nacho Libre if you're a Jack Black fan.

1978060,4,B00018U9FW,"While School of Rock is billed as a comedy, I found it more related to Shakespearian comedies than say recent movie comedy. That is to say that no one died and overall it had a good ending. I was surprised to find very few laugh-out-loud moments in this movie. Maybe I'm just a tough audience, but that was my take. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy it.

As a matter of fact, I quite enjoyed it. This is something of a feel good story, and it is fun, which is something I always enjoy in movies. While the story leaves a certain number of blatant holes, such as how easy it would be to be invited to a prestigious prep school as a substitute, it is enjoyable enough that I can forgive the unlikely plausibility.

Central to School of Rock is the music. By this I mean that the themes revolve around music not that music is what it is all about. Rock is what molds the protagonist, Dewey Finn, and puts him into the situation that starts the basic plot. Rock is what pulls him out of the funk that he finds himself in, and what gets him into a bit more trouble.

The kids are what make the movie though, and I enjoyed the fact that they play so well. The kids do offer the opportunity for Dewey to change (a little) and to offer his own wisdom to help them through the rather convoluted (or weak) issues they experience, such as being cool, stage fright, and pressure from both peers and parents.

My favorite part was the concert at the end of the movie. In the concert, one gets to see the fun of rock and roll, both during the performance and at the conclusion of the performance.

I think I would have enjoyed a little bit more on the history of rock, other than just a diagram, but that is something that is a minor concern.

I would recommend this movie as a light repast. It isn't very serious, and it isn't over-the-top comedic, but it is fun, for at least an hour and forty minutes or so. I give it 3  stars, which I rounded up.

As far as extras, they were okay, but they were neither a deal maker, or deal breaker.

I enjoyed the Kids' commentary, though it completely overtakes the movie so that you really don't hear the movie during the overplay.

The Lessons Learned section was moderately okay, and you had a better chance at meeting the young actors. There was a little tongue and cheek by Jack Black, which I had mixed (slightly toward positve) feelings about.

I would still reccomend the movie, just on fun.",1230768000,2,2425,4.284463894967177

1978108,3,B00018U9FW,"There was a lot of hype surrounding `School of Rock' by the time I finally got around to watching it; hype that I'm not sure I really understand.  Sure, parts of this film are funny, but it's never so funny that I can't hold back the laughter.  In fact, for every critic and fan alike who scream this as being one of Black's greatest film roles (there was even talk back when this was released of his performance being `Oscar' worthy) I'm left a little confused because to me he's done much better than this.  Black does have his moments, but it's never enough to really convince me that he's award worthy.  To me it's nothing more than an amiably funny performance.

The film follows Dewey Finn, played by Black, a down on his luck guitar player who never stopped following his dream even though it left him broke, friendless and pretty much considered a loser by his peers.  Being behind on his rent and jobless (recently being booted from his band) Dewey steals the identity of his roommate and takes on a sub-teaching job at a local elementary school.  Dewey of course has no idea what to do with these children, that is until he finds out that they are all insanely talented musicians.  Wanting to compete in `The Battle of the Bands' he decides to form a band within his classroom disguising the idea as a school project for next quarter that they are getting a leg up on.

The plot of course follows the same formula of `dork uses people, everything goes great, dork is exposed, dork learns lesson, everything is great' that most comedies of this persuasion find themselves pigeonholed into, but it's still fun.  The musical numbers are by far the more entertaining scenes in the film, especially at the end when they perform at `The Battle of the Bands'.

Some have mentioned that Black steals the show, but I strongly disagree.  To me it's Joan Cusack, the school principle, who steals every frame.  Cusack is probably my all time favorite supporting actress.  She makes even the unwatchable films worth the time.  Here, as the uptight principle she is just completely on mark the whole time.  She's quick witted, funny and intelligent, a brilliant actress.  Sarah Silverman also adds some character as the only real villain in the film, playing Dewey's roommates battleaxe of a girlfriend.  She's funny in that irritating yelling `want to sock her in the mouth' kind of way, which I didn't expect from her.

All in all this is not a bad film, it is funny, but it lacks originality, and to me Black is just not that wonderful.  He serves his purpose (that of playing the dim witted idiot who learns a life lesson as well as teaches one) but any other comedian could have pulled this off, maybe even better.  Black is no Ferrell or Carrey, but he does succeed in making the general public laugh, most of the time, and here is one of his more polished roles (as in not much gross humor or unnecessary crudeness) so it should appeal to most in the family.  I may not completely agree with the praise heaped upon this film, but I can't argue with the fact that it did make me laugh and didn't leave me sour.",1186963200,2,3112,4.539426523297491

Well, with a little fast talking and identity theft Finn takes the identity of his zombie roommate and assumes the role of substitute teacher at a prestigious academy.  The kids he is to teach are expecting him to teach standard school subjects.  Dewey, a rock musician, is not prepared to teach them anything.  But, there is one subject that touches his soul--that is rock music.  It turns out that several of his students are musically inclined, and they end up developing a musical ensemble, while avoiding the suspicious unlooking of an uptight  school superintendent (Joan Cusak).  This is pure fantasy, but, Jack Black is a terrific physical comedian [comparable, perhaps, to the late, great Chris Farley].

1978111,4,B00018U9FW,"School of Rock is one of those films that's tailor-made for the comedian performing in it.  This has become all the rage since Robin Williams played the Genie in Aladdin, Jim Carey in The Mask, or Will Ferrell in Elf.  These sorts of films play to the comedian's strengths and minimize their weaknesses, and when they get it right, it's movie magic.

And so Black gets his moment in School of Rock.  Black's been playing the overweight guy pining for the good old days of rock like geeks pine over the original Star Trek series, with pop-eyed enthusiasm far outweighing the energy that most people muster for just about anything.  Black is truly the uber-music geek and the title is well earned through a film history of Black essentially playing the same guy: Bio-Dome (as Tenacious D), High Fidelity (as Barry), Shallow Hal (as Hal), and of course Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. In short, if there's going to be a film about kids learning about the pedigree of rock and roll, Black would be the guy who wrote, directed, and acted in it.

What's surprising is that this movie ISN'T Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny.  As a music geek, Black's tastes for music could easily alienate much of the audience.  School of Rock isn't just about rock; it's about music appreciation, the lack of attention paid to kids in school, teacher malaise, and a society that no longer fights the Man.  Or to put it another way, this is a movie made for the mainstream.

Which is what makes it so much fun.  Our slacker hero, Dewey Finn (Jack Black), has been crashing at his substitute teacher friend's house (Ned, played by Mike White).  When Ned's girlfriend (the lovely Sarah Silverman, playing a decidedly unfunny role) pushes for Dewey's ouster, the slob has to get a job.  And so he does, by impersonating Ned at a private school for upper class kids. It's not long before Dewey throws out the curriculum and teaches the kids his own brand of history: good old, wholesome rock and roll.

School of Rock spends a lot of time struggling to justify the madness: the kids soundproof the room, teachers occasionally think they hear something, the uptight principal springs surprise visits (played by the delightfully naughty Joan Cusack), and parents start to get worried.  Just about none of it is believable, most specifically when Dewey is finally caught by the police and ends up dashing down the hallway, two guitars in hand, without any further consequences.

But that's beside the point.  Who cares if School of Rock bends the laws of time and space to allow Dewey's one chance in the sun, not as a rock star but as the aging patriarch of a band of insanely talented pre-teens?  We came to see a rock show, and we get it.

Black flops around, he sweats, he tosses his head with manic glee, but most of all he passionately TEACHES.  He teaches a large girl that her weight doesn't matter, teaches the geek that he should ignore the kids who make fun of him, teaches the brat some discipline, and encourages the brilliance of the lead queen bee to use her powers for good instead of evil.  He makes a difference with the kids by bringing what he knows best to the room; not school learning, but plain old-fashioned street smarts.  Dewey's, and by extension Black's, sheer enthusiasm makes up for his rough edges.

But what's unexpectedly wonderful about ""School of Rock"" is how it is also a send-up of the ""inspiring teacher"" film. Black is so dominant in this film (and Joan Cusack makes such a fine prep-school principal) that it's easy to miss how unexpectedly great the kids are -- how convincingly and charmingly they play from inside their stereotypes, pushing on those types -- and also how unexpectedly realistic are the parents (not to mention Black's roommate the real Ned Schneebly). Just at the moment you expect the parents to cave in and embrace ""Mr. S's"" unusual methods, they surprise you, and react as real parents would. The final scenes of the film thus both are and are not typical. This movie doesn't really subvert its kind, but it's constantly playing the genre just on the edge.

That's only part of what makes it wonderful",1174694400,2,1233,4.757009345794392

Most of the music is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time (it reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!).

1978161,5,B00018U9FW,"Oh, how to best convey the majesty that is Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock', starring Jack Black and Joan Cusack? Maybe I could say it rocked? Nah, too obvious. Maybe I could talk about the music? Nah, anyone can see what the soundtrack was just by looking at the relevant IMDb page. Maybe I should say how guilty yet excited I feel to have enjoyed this movie far more than all the arthouse stuff and Oscar-bait I've seen this year - but that makes the film seem like a guilty pleasure, and there's nothing wrong with holding your head up high and saying you love Linklater, Black, Cusack, writer Mike White and co-star Sarah Silverman.

Or maybe - just maybe - I could say that when I got in last night, I still felt charmed and elated and deliriously happy by the spell that this movie - this silly, sentimental little commercial movie - had cast on me. This is a feel-good movie where the feel-good ending is actually the best part, rather than a syrupy, predictable letdown. The characters have damn well earned that happy ending, and you want them to get it so badly, even as Linklater adds enough grace notes of harsh reality to let you know that our heroes may not succeed. And he sells you on this, too.

Up until recently, the playfully philosophical Linklater's most mainstream movie was his glorious 70s ensemble comedy 'Dazed & Confused' (1993). Dewey Finn, the central character in this movie, played by Jack Black as an even goofier extension of Jack Black, feels like one of the kids from that movie all grown up - or rather, not grown up. Dewey still believes in the power of rock to change lives, to change the world, even - but The Man has ground his spirit down. Many reviews note how Mike White's script doesn't really seem to believe in the power of rock as much as Dewey does, and it's true that 'School of Rock' is hardly an underground missive from the scene like, say, Alex Cox's rock films are. But that's intentional. Dewey is adrift without a 'scene' to back him up, and he slowly has to accept that no, there's nothing he can do about the fact that The Man rules the world. All he can do is build his little corner of it.

And build it he does. Dewey's audacious plan is to pose as a substitute teacher and use the kids under his tutelage to form the most rocking band who ever were - The School Of Rock - and blow his old band off the stage at the Battle of the Bands. What's good about the kids is a microcosm of what's good about the film - the audience never laughs at them, always with them, and their appreciation of music is sincere and unaffected. The kids are non-actors (like the kids in Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's 'City of God') chosen for their musical ability, and it's a joy seeing their fingers dance dexterously around a panoply of instruments. They rock, too - so many movies about music are brought down by the unremarkable nature of their fictional bands, but if School Of Rock were a real band, man, I'd buy their CD in a heartbeat.

The other good quality shared by the kids and the movie is this; they both know their stuff, and while adhering to the structure of a formula comedy, enough esoterica and clever parodies are thrown in to tickle even the most [...] of rock lovers. The references can get as obscurely hilarious as the countless operas, wines and psychology in-jokes in 'Frasier': it just deals in a different area. So we get Dewey waxing lyrical about the keyboard solos on Yes songs, film clips of Angus Young and Keith Moon are shown without spelling out who they are for the audience, and the winning band at the climatic Battle sound hilariously akin to inexplicably popular post-grunge whingers Staind.

'School of Rock' captures the giddy excitement of being young and cocky and creative like no film I've ever seen; it features the best performance to date from Jack Black, a whirling, borderline-psychotic, hilariously hammy tornado ripping through the film; it allows the frequently underused Joan Cusack to be funny and even sexy within the confines of an 'authority' role; it is the best film about rock and roll since 'This Is Spinal Tap' and it succeeds in transporting Linklater's style, imagination and vital humanity into the mainstream without compromise in a way that, say, the Coen brothers have yet to do. Everyone involved should give themselves a pat on the back, or better yet, a big, sweaty, post-gig group hug.",1160956800,2,4413,4.573957016434893

Essentially this is the story of an out-of-money rocker, who poses as his teacher friend and substitutes at an exclsuive school in order to earn some cash. He ends up turning his young class into a rock music class, teaching the kids about rock, and forming them into a band as a class project. Along the way, he becomes a better person, though it's only apparent in the little touches along the way...and he makes his students realize their potential as well.

School of Rock is a great movie for a number of reasons. The first of these: The plot is predictable yada yada... but the humor still takes you by surprise, and it's actually FUNNY humor for the most part. Reason number 2: We get quite the soundtrack along with a lot of good instrumental skill from Jack Black and the kids. Reason number 3: The kids themselves are hysterical. We have Freddie, the drummer, who is exactly the opposite of what a 10 year old prep school kid should be. We have one ten year old kid who designs clothes, forget that he's a guy. We have a nerdy keyboardist and a whole class full of other wackos.

Is this the guy that wrote FHG?  Is this the twisted dude that stared in the short-lived HBO series about being a lunatic rock demigod suffering in obscurity with his bro K.G.?

Well...sure it is, but a kinder, gentler Jack Black, like the one we glimpse in King Kong and saw so long ago in Shallow Hal.

Sponge extraordinaire and underground rock God in training Dewey Finn is struggling with his band and his muted rock genius as well as his roommates new girlfriend who wants him to stop sponging and start paying some rent.  He gets kicked out of his own band for his onstange antics and ultimate lameness.  Things really suck.  A phone call from a Prep School for his roomie Ned is intecepted by the Finn and bingo, the plan is hatched.  Horace Green needs a substitute teacher for a few weeks and Dewey needs some Benjamins (money).  How hard could it be?

Dewey become Ned and takes over a classroom full of overachieving brainiac Yuppie larva.  Boredom ensues until, by chance, Dewey overhears his students wailing away in music class.  What is going on?  He's got a group of potential rockers in his grasp and The Battle Of The Bands is drawing near.  Time for a little class project.

School of Rock is charming and funny in all its little ways.  Jack Black is insane and hysterical and filled to the brim with rock lore.  My kids and I both liked it.  Is it the greatest movie ever?

Well, I was wrong.

While there isn't really much in the way of being really ""spectacular"" filmicly, Linklater wisely sets the camera back and lets the real talent shine.  Most dominantly, what is immediately received from this film is that these kids rock.  But what's really important is that these kids really, really do rock.  Combine them with the personality of Black and the acting of Joan Cusack, and you get really enjoyable performances all around.

Also, Mike White's writing and roll in this film are very much worth mentioning.  What seems like a typical story really does have things to say about following your dreams, but more importantly it also shows the pitfalls of those dreams as well...  the characters willing to ""sell out"", the fact that they don't really win the competition, the necessity of avoiding those that just want to use rock as a way to be a bum...  all of that is cleverly put in there.  Just Cusack's little monologue when her character's drunk in the van with Black is enough to point out that there's actually real substance behind this script and it's not just a cop-out Hollywood film.

Which is great because it's also low on the overt ""stupid loser"" jokes that tend to be mostly thrown around in the attempt to make a story about a supposed loser funny.  It's also low on language, so really it can be very enjoyable for many reasons, whichever way you want to approach it.

It seems on the cover to be a film that would be a quick fad and then eventually disappear into the annuls of lost comedies, but if it actually does, that's tragic, because it really is a film worth appreciating.

This teetered on the edge but landed strong for the awesome performances by Jack Black and Joan Cusack, the style of the film's direction, and of course, the soundtrack.

The people who made it probably realized the plot was too weak and unconvincing to drive itself, so they made a smart move by using the plot as a tool to display the great behavioral comedy. Jack Black impersonates his best friend to get smoe money substitute teaching. There's a problem, though. He knows nothing about the cirriculum. Instead he teaches them little goodies like the definition of a hangover. ""Does that mean you're drunk?"" ""Close. It means I was drunk yesterday.""

The film sympathizes with him but only to a point. Sure, he's an innocent guy who only wants to make great music, but he's also self-absorbed and refuses to take responsibility for anything. The film shows him for what he really is, a creep.

But then something happens. He finds out the kids are talented classical musicians. He decides to harness that energy into rock lightning by mentoring them into his lifestyle.

It all leads up to a battle of the bands featuring School of Rock in one of the best musical numbers of the new millenium. The furious parents watch it and grow proud. It's tacky, but the scene is pulled off with such grace and style, I didn't even mind. They end up losing to a talentless emo band who look sexier, but School of Rock gets called out for the encore.

The kids are extremely talented musicians, but most of them don't have the passion to carry a performance on their own.

The DVD plays fine in a regular DVD player.

This week out of necessity I stumbled across the term ""CoDec"" for computers that essentially is the computer's ability to decode the coded information on digital media, DVD and music files. It's a little confusing at first but after a while I learned that a good amount of people don't like the way Windows Media Player works. So I disabled that player and downloaded ""K-Lite Mega Codec Pack"". There's two media players that come with it and now the sound problem is fixed! It turned out to be a codec problem.

If you've ever had a problem with a movie's sound then it may pay off to look into getting a better media player and codec pack.

1978249,4,B00018U9FW,"I watched this movie with a bad attitude coming into it. I thought it would be a stupid and weird movie but when a friend brought it over, I watched it to be polite and to say it quite frankly, it rocked! Wow, was I surprised but it was some great fun and good laughs.

The movie is about a rock star who is mad becuase he gets kicked out of his group. He then after getting a phonecall, takes a job as a substitute teacher for 5th graders. And when he learns that they can play musical instruments, he trains them to compete in a competiton where he hopes to beat his old band. The movie is quite simply fuuny and is also just really fun. You'll like all of the kids but you'll especially like Jack Black who was great. This is no brainer rent and a worthy buy as it's fuuny, interesting and really cool.",1120348800,2,805,4.094936708860759
1978250,4,B00018U9FW,"Dewey Finn is a 30-something slacker with aspirations of being in a successful rock band but who can't seem to make it happen.  His latest collaborators have just kicked him out, so he spends his time sleeping and eating, until he intercepts a phone call meant for his roommate, who works as a substitute teacher.  When he finds out how much the job pays, he decides to fake his way into it, intending to slack off some more and pick up a paycheck.  Then he happens to catch the students at band practice, and discovers that his perfect rock band might be sitting right under his nose.

Even though I really like most of Richard Linklater's films (WAKING LIFE, BEFORE SUNRISE, TAPE), I had no plans to see this one originally for a couple reasons:  1. I don't much care for kids in my films.  2. I don't much care for Jack Black; though he is amusing in smaller roles (HIGH FIDELITY) I was pretty sure he'd be intolerable as a central character.  But recently I saw the trailer and thought it looked like it might be kind of funny, so I decided to give it a chance.  It was much better than I expected.  Black keeps his manic act under control for the most part, and is quite entertaining (and his character becomes surprisingly likable once he gets his act together.)  The kids are - dare I say it? - actually charming.  And the script by Mike White (THE GOOD GIRL) is smart and funny.

This film, which features a cast of nine to eleven year-olds, is rated PG-13 for ""rude humor and drug references.""  They say ""ass"" a few times and the ""drug references"" must have been so vague that I can't even remember any.  A beer is sipped gingerly at a restaurant, and Dewey mentions that he has a hangover on the first day of class.  Oh, I know what it was; Dewey says that one of the other teachers ""must be on crack.""  Anyway, you'd have to be insanely uptight to worry about any of these things.  I have no qualms about recommending this as a family film, an intelligent one that both kids and adults will enjoy because it doesn't talk down to either.  It's also a genuine feel-good movie, not in the fake, sugary way that makes you feel like throwing up.  It has a real heart, and even a little subversive edge to it.

The DVD contains numerous extras including two commentary tracks (one with Black and Linklater which is moderately interesting, and one with the kids which is extremely annoying), behind the scenes footage, film festival footage, trailers, and a video plea they made to try to convince Led Zeppelin to let them use one of their songs.",1120089600,10,2550,4.431330472103005
1978251,5,B00018U9FW,"When I first saw the title of this movie, I saw Jack Black on the cover. I'll admit with all honesty, I don't like Jack Black that well. He's always gotten on my nerves, and to say the least, never impressed me. But then my Bible study leader, (let me please repeat that) MY BIBLE STUDY LEADER recommended this by simply saying, ""It has a message."" As every movie usually does, and I wondered what it could possibly be. I took a chance when I viewed it, and was rewarded with nothing less then a top notch watch!

So I watched Dewey Finn, basically a nobody, become somebody, to a classroom full of kids, who learn to have fun, while they also learn a little bit about self worth. CLASS IS IN SESSION!!!

So, we're taken through an era of rock music! I loved it that it had a clip of Keith Moon, the late drummer of ""The Who"". It even had a sample of Led Zeppelin, and you don't exactly hear that in too many films these days, do you? And through it all, Dewey pretends to be his buddy, Ned. In the process, he teaches this class, but in a most unlikely manner, and with the most unlikely results. When an overweight girl isn't feeling very confident, Finn reminds her that Aretha Franklin was overweight, yet on stage, she blew the crowds away! The message that it doesn't matter who you are, or what others think of you, but it does matter what you bring to the stage, the stage of life, and self confidence, and about being your best! That's what a lot of us forget sometimes, and even though it could be goofy, sometimes screwy, it was a wake up call that so many of us need. Let me put in simply... WAKE UP!!!

Sticking it to the man, being hard core, all with a few good laughs in the process. And by the way, even for a PG-13, it wasn't too hard core, but it was all heart. If we would just learn a lesson that is so valuable through a little humor. Embrace this, and watch it again, and let it release you from a long, hard day! Jack Black, I'm impressed. Ya gotta do it again sometime. Rock on!",1120003200,,2003,4.183937823834197

It's looking like Dewey's going to be forced into selling his valuables to make up the money until a phone call from a desperate principal of the best-ranked private school around lands him with a job as a substitute teacher for the most unique and highly entertaining class you've ever seen.

This was a very good movie!  I have to say, I was surprised at how clean it was.  There was no sexual content, as I had thought.  It was just cussing and occasional innapropriate language and Dewey sticking his three fingers up and telling his bandmates to ""read between the lines"".  Overall, I say that if you love rock n' roll music, comedy, and great acting, then I recommend this movie to you.  It's not one of my favorites, but I'm glad that I watched it, because I enjoyed it very much.",1118707200,,1056,4.407216494845361

1978295,5,B00018U9FW,"'School Of Rock' is a very funny comedy starring the ever crazed antics of Jack Black. And even though he style varies little from movie to movie theres an odd likability about him. Sure he's manic and opinionated in the classic Belushi/Farley tradition but just as endearing. In this movie Jack portrays Dewey Finn,a failed guitarist with little more then big dreams of being a rock star. Through a turn of events he ends up masquerading as his best friend as a substitute teacher at a private school,forced to deal with a group of overachieving but slightly disfunctional pupils. He rounds on the one talent he has-music and ralleys the kids into forming a rock band. Many of the children have alot of talent and in the doing both Dewey and his students learn important lessons about inspiration and commitment. Everything almost comes down for Dewey when his fraud is revealed but not before the premier of his band,the School Of Rock and a song his young guitarist had written for a performance at a battle of the bands,designed orginally for Dewey to rebuild his career. Even though his old band (without him) wins everyone learns important lessons and Dewey and his young charges find a place for themselfs in the world.

  'School Of Rock' is a very entertaining comedy,not only because of Black but his students in the movie,all of whom are real musical prodigys. Also the movie has an important point to make about commitment and not letting go of your dreams. Black's character Dewey Finn embodies some rock clishes-an overwhelming

personality,a need too be very loud and a bit of an ego. But he actually emmerges as an encourging and empowering presence for his students. Some of them are shyly talented and it takes the unflappable personality of Dewey to bring them around. One unusual thing is how much the character detests the concept of sex,drugs and rock n' roll-it's all about the music to him 100%,even if it is implied he's been on the other side. I actually got alot out of this movie-Jack Black and his students provide alot of hilerious moments,as does supporting actress Joan Cussack. But I was also very entertained and felt even uplifted at the end. Maybe you will too!",1116374400,,2197,4.788918205804749
1978296,4,B00018U9FW,"Whether you agree with any given review of ""School of Rock"" is determined entirely by whether you are a fan of Jack Black or if you think he is the most annoying actor working today.  Full disclosure -- I love his work, just as I generally can't stand the films of Adam Sandler or David Spade.  (You realize that you really, really need to get a life when you realize you have just participated in a raging debate over the respective merits and flaws of ""Joe Dirt,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" and ""School of Rock."")

In a role that Jack Black could play in his sleep, Black plays Dewey Finn, a slacker whose dream is to be a God of Rock.  (As a child of the 70s, I knew a few guys liks this -- the kind of guy who can't study for a history final but has memorized all the liner notes for every Metallica album.)  A talented guitarist who is too in love with the music, Finn is booted out of his band after too many 20-minute solos and unsuccesful stage dives.  And all just before a Battle of the Bands is scheduled, with a hefty purse.  In the life of Dewey Finn, this rises to the level of tragedy.

To make matters worse, his best buddy's girlfriend has shrewishly demanded that Finn be kicked out of their apartment for the mere fact that Finn does not pay his share of the rent. Wonder of wonders, Finn intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy (a substitute teacher, whom Finn hilariously keeps referring to as ""temping"") from the uptight principal (Joan Cusack) of the most exclusive school in town.  Thinking quickly, Finn is soon on board as the substitute in his friend's place -- at least he can get the paycheck and keep his corner of the apartment.

As can be expected, the class is a bunch of wonderfully cute, very talented kids who have all creativity stifled by the school and their uptight parents.  But in a fit of inspiration, Finn concocts a scheme to have these kids be his band (he will of course sing lead vocals and play lead guitar) so he can enter the Battle of the Bands.

Here is where the movie takes off.  The kids all ring true, and Finn exercises a lot of creativity to make sure that all 20-odd kids have roles in the band, even if they can't play an instrument.  And the kids who can play an instrument or sing are pretty darn good.  In perhaps the movie's most touching component, Finn realizes that while he can teach these kids a lot about music (""Rock History,"" ""Rock Appreciation and Theory,"" etc.), he can learn a lot from them, too.  And he doesn't learn sappy ""lessons about life"" -- he learns that these kids are gifted musicians who can teach him more about music, as well.

As charming as the kids are, this is Jack Black's picture from start to finish.  His inherent mania for rock music is apparent in every scene, and Black may have the most devious set of eyes in film today.  Contrary to W.C. Fields, who said that no actor should ever work with kids or animals, Black is also very comfortable working with the kids, treating them with a nice balance of respect and disdain that seems very true to his character.  The delightful Joan Cusack gets some nice moments as the repressed principal with a Stevie Nicks fetish, but this isn't her meatiest role.

A genuinely funny movie that has a conventional plot (is there any wonder whether these kids will get to play in the Battle of the Bands?), ""School of Rock"" is a fun entertainment.  Surprisingly kid-friendly (I expected more profanity) without being mawkish, this movie offers a good balance of cliche and originality that makes it worthy of the film library.",1114560000,,3556,4.446841294298921
1978297,5,B00018U9FW,"I finally got the chance to see this movie on Saturday with a friend of mine. Personally, I thought it was hilarious. I enjoyed it tremendously. Jack Black confirmed his ""God"" status yet again to me. I think this was his best movie yet. Giving Jack Black a starring role in a movie about rock music was the single best decision made by Hollywood in 2003. Needless to say, I was stunned, and even after the movie was done, I stayed and watched the end credits sequence. The reason this movie worked was because although it was aimed primarily at children, it was *NOT* a kid's movie: it was a FAMILY movie. That is, everybody, young and old, male and female, smart and stupid, could enjoy it. If you were a kid, you got some funny physical humor with nary a flatulence joke in sight (thank GOD)! If you were an adult, you got some funny subtle music references. And the peculiar thing is this, my friends: this movie worked on multiple levels. If you wanted just straight-forward, good-natured comedy, you got it. If you wanted an inspirational story that sends a good message to kids, you sure got it. If you wanted a movie that kicks MTV in the face and glorifies REAL rock music, you definitely got it. This movie is about a lot of things, and it isn't preachy or heavy-handed, nor does it have stupid plot twists (I was very happy that one of the kids didn't end up with cancer or break their arms or something). I was surpremely enthralled with this movie, and I bow down at the altar of Jack Black, for bestowing his glory upon yet another quality work of cinema. The only gripe I have is that it would have been nice to see just a *little* more tension between the kids' parents and Jack Black, especially towards the end, but hey, it was still a great movie.",1114387200,,1765,4.400611620795107

Anyway, I saw all the extras on the DVD and it explained that these kids (I'm not sure if it's all of them) are musicians, not actors.  Well, that's the problem.  The children were bland and unexciting at times.  Otherwise, this is a great movie for kids and adults (especially adults that love classic rock).  Kids will probably love this movie.

1978299,4,B00018U9FW,"School Of Rock is a fun film written for comedian/actor Jack Black.

Yes, but the relationship between him and the kids becomes one of friendship.  His dream becomes their dream.

  Jack Black and the kids are the film.  In the extras Jack Black says he has no fear of working with children or animals because he's both!  He is the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, the shark of Jaws and the killer whale of Free Willy. A dominating Special Effect that fits perfectly with this film.

There's something schools don't teach and that's passion. They don't teach that you should actually care about what you're learning. And like the kids who were in the music class, yeah they could play but they didn't really care about it. Jack Black taught them how to love what they do and it was so obvious how much fun he and those kids were having on screen and that just makes it all the more enjoyable for the audience.

From Black's idiotic Dewey character to his outrageous scheme to find lost rock glory, this entire film entertains.  With a solid supporting cast and brilliant young actors and actresses, this film is worth the price.

Much like with ""Shallow Hal,"" Black shows us that being the geeky kid or the quiet kid or the chubby kid doesn't matter as long as you believe in yourself and enjoy what you do.  Black takes a bunch of kids with insecurities and turns them into a group of confident youngsters who rock with the best of them.

Overall, this is a really great feel-good flick that most of the family can enjoy.  There is a little language, but other than that, Black keeps the movie pretty clean.

1978349,4,B00018U9FW,"Although it is unlikely that one can encounter so many talented players and singers in just one class at a private school, despite the fact that (people may say that) the plot is predictable, that nevertheless does not stop Mike White from penning a piece that is designed to fly in the face of predictability or Richard Linklater from directing a feel-good movie that should delight many people, even those who are, like myself, admittedly not fans of rock music per se, yet love it when it is good.

A sacked rock guitarist, Dewey Finn (Jack Black), exercises ""identity fraud"" by claiming to be substitute teacher Ned Shneebly (Mike White) when the principal of a private prep school, Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), wants to talk to Ned about a temporary job. Desperately for money to pay his part of the rent - or else face eviction at the hands of Ned and his irksomely patronizing girlfriend, Patty (Sarah Silverman) - he intends to contribute nothing to the education of his young charges until a chance overhearing of their music class immediately fires him with the idea of turning them into a ""high-voltage"" rock band in order for them to compete with the people who had sacked him in a forthcoming rock band competition.

With the predictable role of a ""rules-are-meant-to-be-broken"" maverick, Black blends comedy and humour into his alter ego, although one cannot at times help thinking that he tends to dominate the movie. There are hardly any scenes whatsoever in the movie in which Black does not feature, and so one tends to believe that it all centres more on the character of Finn as opposed to on the ones who make ""The School of Rock"" such a hit at the competition. I would have liked to have seen more character development from the supporting cast members - that is, from the youngsters - yet it seems that only their collective musical talent is allowed to have its day on stage as opposed to their abilities as actors, some of whom were making their movie debut.

The only moment of real ""drama"" comes when drummer Freddy Jones (14-year-old Kevin Clark) is persuaded to join some guys from a rival band in their van when the kids go to an audition for the competition. Finn does his nut and effectively hauls the card-playing youngster out of the van out of concern that the guys might otherwise have their own agenda for him, though it was never made clear what that might have been.

The moral of the story appears to be that rock (an analogy for life, perhaps?) is not about winning music contests, which was the raison d'etre for Finn wanting his class to perform, but about ""winning"" against ""The Man"" (an analogy for authority, personified by the Cusack character), something that even the youngsters hammer home to him in a kind of role reversal where the students teach the ""teacher"" a lesson in life.

Overall, it is a good movie to watch, with some very catchy rock songs, although the music itself, like the Jack Black character, does tend to dominate right from the start (before the stars even have a chance to surround the Paramount Pictures mountain peak) to the very end. The music itself ought to have been more of a backdrop to the story yet it tended to become a bit too prominent. It is, after all, not meant to be a movie about rock music, but it was in danger of becoming one.",1105747200,,3321,4.631578947368421
1978350,2,B00018U9FW,"For the sake of space, I will be forced to dismiss the entire first half of the movie with the following: that's a whole hour of my life that I can never have back. Yes, to say that the first chunk of this movie was lame and unfunny is to do a disservice to the words ""lame"" and ""unfunny.""

But things pick up somewhere around the middle--and the movie's primary descriptive adjective rises from ""terrible"" to merely ""tepid."" Any idiot could surmise the entire progression of the movie's plot before the opening credits finish rolling, and once the predictable plot proper gets underway, it isn't so bad. The kids (remarkable musicians, really) get more air time, the trivial social conflicts impeding Jack are largely resolved, and there appears to be a concert looming on the celluloid horizon. Wowzers. Maybe by the end of this thing, the prep school kids' tight-laced parents will loosen up and realize that God Gave Rock and Roll to You after all. wouldn't that be nice? wouldn't that fulfill the cutsey formula? Yeah. Don't expect Jack Black to go out on a limb with this one.

So the kids were amazing and the movie had its ""moments"" (learning that ""Ned"" was once in a glam goth band, for example), but overall I found School of Rock distracting and tedious. As someone who spent several years responsible for large groups of elementary school children, I spent too much time cringing with horror to be amused. Jack regularly herds the students into his van and then leaves them places while he conducts bits of business. And by and large the kids all stay put. Cripes. No given group of TEACHERS behaves so well. My own experiences with kid groups were somewhat different--i.e., weaving through a dark, people-packed aquarium while I obsessively counted to fifteen over and over again, praying that the bobbing heads I've numbered at least mostly belong to the actual kids in my actual care. Oh look, there goes Jared into the sea-snake tank. hope he's had all his shots. Yes, Taran, I see that you lost a tooth. Next time be careful how you catch that revolving door. Bethany, take that frog out of your mouth; your face is starting to swell.

Right. Anyway. If you're a Jack Black fan, you'll probably like this movie. It is less inane than it could have been, though it does not achieve the comic greatness it might have known with a different writer, director and lead actor. That's just my opinion though, so if you've got money burning a hole in your pocket and a few brain cells you don't mind wasting--have at.",1105660800,3,2526,4.671910112359551

1978354,4,B00018U9FW,"Okay, Jack Black isn't my favorite. And I didn't really think I'd like ""School of Rock"" terribly much, but it wasn't that bad. Actually, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it, and I would allow my kids to watch it, too.

Black, like in many other roles, portrays the loser - the guy that really isn't doing anything with his life - until he is sort of inadvertently given the opportunity to substitute teach at the best elementary school in town. Easy, right? Recess all day long, no worries. Wrong. Of course the school is completely filled with baby overacheivers.

To make a long story short, Black ends up teaching these kids the only thing he knows, and the only thing they don't: rock 'n roll.

He creates a band using the kids' talents, ending in playing, and being a huge success, in the Battle of the Bands.

In all, Black's character teaches the kids valuable life lessons: there's more to life than looks, music can be fun, everyone's put here for a reason. Trends where morals are cool have been happening not only in ""School of Rock,"" but also in smash films like ""Shrek."" I think that a film like this is not only fun, but okay for the kids. They won't leave it feeling like they have to be perfect, but that flawed is cool.

The writing is also rather smart. It appeals to older fans with scenes with Jack Black and the rock music, but ""School of Rock"" also appeals to the younger audience because most of the cast is comprised of, well, a younger crowd.

Overall, ""School of Rock"" is pleasing to just about any audience. However, if you really can't stand Black's antics, maybe pass this one up. But for me, four stars!",1103846400,4,1630,4.453020134228188
1978355,3,B00018U9FW,"***1/2 After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in ""The School of Rock,"" a sporadically funny comedy that is part ""Sister Act"" and part genial spoof of all those movies about a ""super teacher"" who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.

Black plays Dewey Finn, an aging rock'n'roller who is still awaiting that moment when he will ""make it big"" in the music world.  He lives with Ned Schneebly, his longtime rocker buddy, who has traded in his dreams of musical glory for a nagging girlfriend and a job as a substitute teacher.  Desperate for money to pay the rent, Dewey pretends to be Schneebly and takes a job as a sub at a snooty, tradition-bound prep school, where the last thing the administration and the parents would want is a Jimmy Hendricks knockoff teaching their kids.  And since Dewey really only knows one thing, this uncredentialed professorial imposter decides to make rock'n'roll the sole focus of his curriculum, turning these inward, shy, nerdish kids into a viable rock band - all under the radar screen of the ever-watchful administrators and parents of course.

Although the storyline wends its way along a predictable path, writer Mike White and director Richard Linklater find a great deal of warmth and humor in the material.  Dewey's utter obsession with rock music and rock history is reflected in the fact that he leads the band members in a prayer to the ""god of rock"" before a concert, and screams in frustration -  ""What have they been teaching you kids at this school?"" - when he finds out his pupils have never been educated in the basics of Hendricks, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  Dewey is so preposterously well-meaning and good-natured that the audience can't help but root for him and his students as they embark on their mad quest to appear at a local battle of the bands competition, unbeknownst to the powers-that-be at the school.

The children playing the students are all winning and charming, and Joan Cusack cuts a sympathetic figure as the uptight school principal who harbors a little bit of Stevie Nicks under her prim and proper exterior.  But it is Black who makes this film his own, turning what might have been a buffoonish caricature into a fully-rounded human being.  Black is not afraid to cut loose and take over the screen when necessary, hitting heights of unbridled mania to rival the master, Jim Carrey.  Yet, he also realizes that he is part of an ensemble effort here and understands the importance of integrating himself into the material and not always dominating it.  As a result, even when certain elements of the film fall flat, as they frequently do, Black is always there to prop the movie back up.

""The School of Rock"" is an entertaining little comedy, but unlike a real satire which would skewer the conventions of the genre it is attacking, this film loses its nerve and winds up endorsing those conventions.  Dewey, for all his talk about defying ""The Man,"" is really a rebel in name only, and the film reflects the kind of feel-good populism that no true hard line iconoclast would be caught dead supporting.  I guess it's too much to expect a mainstream Hollywood comedy to launch a truly savage assault on mainstream values (in the way rock, at its best, often does).  Still, it might be nice to come across the unexpected sometime (after all, movies like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""MASH"" were able to do it).

Until then, we'll settle for what we can get.  And Jack Black is good enough for now.",1103500800,,3563,4.75487012987013

I was surprised, however. Jack Black is an amazing actor and musician. He definitely brought the movie to life. I was also extremely impressed with the kids, who really played their instruments. This movie's message and moral are pretty clear without it beating it into your brain. Another reason I loved School of Rock is because the music was just awesome. A lot of kids these days listen to complete trash, and it was definitely refreshing to hear some great music. Watch this movie-- it's the BEST!",1103068800,,662,4.666666666666667

Not in the sense that it is a MUST SEE FILM but rather that it's a very enjoyable 'escape from reality' ....

OK so if its a menatl escape movie you really have to allow the writers some creative leeway that set up the story of a down and out rocker, Jack Balke, managing to get a substitute teacher position at a very very up-tight prep school run by the principal Joan Cusak. Both of them certainly carry the movie and make their roles believable. Similarily the director manages to maintain the prep school 'geek' persona of the students who form the band right until the very end when the 'school' band manages to make it to a battle of the bands rock concert ....

1978358,3,B00018U9FW,"This movie is a really fun film for the entire family with lots of music and plenty of laughs.

Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a loser; he even gets fired from his own band because he can't control his ego and wants the entire limelight. His roommate has grown past the rock and roll life to become a teacher and along with his uptight girlfriend they barrage Dewey with all sorts of negative inspiration forcing him only to withdraw. But then one day a phone call arrives that inspires Dewey into action and he finds himself employed as a substitute teacher at a reserved private school. With a class of brainy nerds awaiting direction Dewey has nothing to offer except music.....and so the story unfolds. Dewey takes this class of intellects and turns them into a great kid's band despite the watchful eyes of the school headmistress Ms. Mullins (Joan Cusack).

Jack Black is funny just watching him exist in all that hyper energy he possesses but in this movie he gets to also show his stuff around music. Although he is sometimes irritatingly crazy most of the time he is really great in this role as a teacher that knows absolutely nothing. Joan Cusack joins Black as the comic relief in this film as the rigid school marm with a secret passion to be Stevie Nicks and flaunt herself in a rock and roll band. The kids are also great in this film in fact almost musical geniuses playing their own instruments as well as pulling off wonderful acting roles. Everyone can watch this movie and find something to enjoy and it's a great motivator for all the losers of the world who just want to play rock and roll....rock on!",1102550400,2,1619,4.541095890410959

Before watching School Rock, I found Jack Black to be the most annoying person on TV. I would make it a point to change the channel every time I saw him on. So, I was very skeptical, when I started watching this. However I was totally sucked in within the first few minutes.

The chemistry between the kids and Jack Black is amazing. They perfectly compliment each other throughout the entire movie. The humor is great, and I found myself rolling down the couch from the laughing a few of times. Watch this movie with a group of people and you will all enjoy it even more. It's not super intelligent humor, but nevertheless makes great entertainment.

The kids playing in the rock band are superb. They are all gifted, and do a great job of acting. They all nicely develop their characters, with Jack's help.

1978361,4,B00018U9FW,"Back in my high school days, I used to give dudes like Jack Black severe wedgies.  Sure, the 'Jack Black' types were the pudgy urchins who loved nothing better than to push the envelope, but they were still annoying enough to disrupt a grand party or, sin of sins, make a pass at a preppy girl.  Thus, the wedgies were administered, while those of us on the superficial side of the intellectual chain couldn't help but admire the 'stick it to the man' mentality of these Pillsbury doughboys.

Hence the appeal of THE SCHOOL OF ROCK, a cute little flick that allows beady-eyed Jack Black to romp and chomp and stomp through a formulaic, totally predictable plot.  As rock superstar wannabe Dewey Finn, Black plays a loose cannon (er, himself) who is short on talent, but long on rock 'n roll fantasy.  When his band dumps him, and he finds himself behind on his rent, he steals the identity of his zombie roommate and pretends to be a 5th grade teacher at a prim and proper prep school.  He has zero teaching skills, but--lucky for him--he does recognize he's been given a class of pre-adolescents who collectively possess the talent he needs to live out his dream:  to put together a kick arse rock band.

And so the school's curriculum is tossed overboard like a bucket of shrimp to sharks, as Dewey shapes and nurtures and cultivates his young charges into a stage band extraordinaire.  Granted, the 'suspension of disbelief' police come calling (How can all of these 10-year-olds be so obscenely talented?), yet Black shamelessly--or better yet, shamefully--pulls everything together as he enters his new creation into a 'Battle of the Bands' contest.  He also collectively pulls the wool over the eyes of the prep school's administration, along with the parents of his new entourage.  By the time Dewey is ""outed,"" it's too late:  The School of Rock is on center stage, playing a gig that brings down the house.

Jack Black carries this movie on his nine-course shoulders; Joan Cusack, who plays Black's hesitant, somewhat suspicious supervisor, so reminds me of a great date I once had that I wanted no one else to know about.  As mentioned before, the plot is predictable, even lame, but THE SCHOOL OF ROCK entertains, simply because rock is rock--even when being played by diaper dandies.

Jack Black pulls off the best performance of his career thus far.  The supporting cast comes together fantastically.  I was really impressed with School of Rock from beginning to end.

Jack Black a.k.a. Dewey Finn, takes on the role of a lost soul who's only dream was to become a Rock & Roll superstar.  In the midst of Dewey searching for stardom, he fell behind on the rent, which ultimately lead to the foundation of the School of Rock.  In a matter of desperation, Dewey steals his best friend's identity, and becomes a substitute school teacher.

At first, being this ""temp"" was just a gig for Dewey to pay his share of the rent, but ironically he discovers a goldmine in his students.  Dewey uncovers the talents and passions within this special group of pupils, and constructs the School of Rock.  Against everything Dewey's friends, enemies and the school system wished, he went on and did what he thought was right, he changed the world by rocking one hell of a show.

School of Rock is a film about more than just Jack Black brand comedy.  It's about sticking it to the man, breaking the rules and liberating people with rock music.  School of Rock paints a picture that music today is not what it used to be (all music), but even with today's generation, music can be rejuvenated and brought back to it's natural elements (all music).",1099958400,4,1498,4.621212121212121

This film desplicts Dewey Finn (Black) who's struggled tremendously for years to become a famous rocker.  After he is fired from his band, he poses as a substitute teacher and uses his brother's name.  There, he begins a new rock band with a twist.  The fellow members are kids in his class.  Finn and the class must keep this a secret to prevent this act from being exposed to the school board and the community.

Though the film is cheesy in numerous scenes, its comedic form makes the film details fit well to one another.  Through the music and the laughs, this film remains unique throughout.  All the details give new comedic meaning to rock music: the quotes, the personalities, the costumes, the performances, and others.  This desplicts accurately the life of a true struggling musician while adding a one-of-a-kind entertaining theme.  All performers add their own sense of plot throughout the film, especially Jack Black in his Golden Globe nominated role for Best Actor in a Comedy Film.

1978450,4,B00018U9FW,"Playing to every music-loving ten-year-old's fantasies, this Richard Linklater film pokes fun at school administrators, pushy parents, kids forced into adult molds too soon, an educational establishment which allows little room for fun in the classroom, and a kid's desire to live a life that's secret from his parents. Great fun to watch and often very funny, the film is full of clichs and stereotyped characters, but that's why it works so well for kids--they can see aspects of themselves in several characters, recognize their own insecurities, but see that life is fun.

Dewey Finn (Jack Black), a manic rock-and-roll wannabe who has lost his job, intercepts a phone call to his roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White), about a substitute teaching job at an elite urban prep school and, desperately needing cash, takes the job teaching uptight fifth graders with highly motivated parents.  Pretending to be Ned and ostensibly teaching the fifth grade core curriculum, he quickly discovers the musical talents of his students, most of whom have been studying serious classical music.  Believing they need to be loosened up, he abandons the curriculum and turns his class into a school of rock, hiding his efforts from the principal (neurotically played by Joan Cusack), and spiriting the class off to a Battle of the Bands contest without the permission of the students' parents or the school administration.

Black is off-the-wall with his manic energy, his mugging, and his free-wheeling heavy-metal style, and his good intentions are so obvious from the outset, that even adult viewers, firmly grounded in reality, get caught up in the fun.  The kids are terrific as they break out of the molds into which they have been forced by their parents and school and, of course, they become better human beings in the process.  Black is so outrageous--and so completely himself--that even the youngest viewer will see him as larger than life.

Written by Mike White, who plays the ""real"" Ned Schneebly in the film, the film offers Jack Black a chance to dominate the film and have fun both with his music and his mugging.  The original music by Jack Black and Mike White, especially the songs like ""Math is a Wonderful thing,"" created on the ""spur of the moment,"" are hilarious, and the demonstration of how a rock song evolves is amusing to watch.  Good, clean fun for the middle school set, parents, and grandparents, this is a film which appeals to that awkward age between childhood innocence and adolescence without being saccharine and condescending.

1978451,5,B00018U9FW,"""Formulated""......""Predictable""......""Unoriginal""  These are all words you may have heard to describe this film, and I wouldn't argue any of them. Let me tell you though, you could also describe this film as ""fun""...""energetic""...and ""factual"".

  The basis of the story is simple. The Belushi-influenced Jack Black plays Musician/loser Dewey Finn. Dewey just got kicked out of his band for being too maniacal and unpredictable, and he's about to be kicked out of his best friend Ned's apartment for being a lazy freeloader. It just so happens that Ned is a substitute teacher, and when Ned gets a call for some work, Dewey answers the phone and accepts the job for himself. Being the furthest thing from a teacher, he tells his class to have recess all day, and teaches his kids about ""the man"". As he feverishly refers to all authority as ""the man"", he says ""There used to be a way to stick it to 'the man', but 'the man' ruined that too with MTV!"" Then he sees his kids in their music class. He has a classically trained guitarist, a classically trained pianist, a percussionist, and a cello player in his midst, and he then gets an idea. He wants music class all day instead of recess. He teaches his guitarist to play classics like ""Iron Man"", ""Smoke On The Water"", and ""Highway To Hell"". He tells his piano player to play The Doors ""Touch Me"". He absurdly convinces his cellist that the cello is the exact same thing as a bass guitar when it's tipped on its side. Dewey has plans to enter the Battle Of The Bands contest and win some rent money, and he's going to do it with these kids.
  Yes, it is predictable. It is also a similar plot to many other teen comedies of the past. The biggest difference between this film and its predecessors, is its intensity and accurate rock knowledge savvy. Jack Black is a power load as Dewey, a real high voltage entity here.  As he states in the film, ""Rock is about the passion"", and his passion and knowledge of rock is so eminent throughout the film. He makes the difference in this film. You just want to stand up and cheer as he hands his keyboard player Yes, and tells him to listen to the solo on ""Roundabout"". He eloquently informs the timid pianist that the solo will ""blow the classical music out your butt"". He continues with his drummer, by telling him to listen to Rush - ""2112"", and informs him that Neil Peart is one of the greatest drummers of all time....""study up"". For his guitarist he has Hendrix's ""Axis: Bold As Love"", and for his backup singer he assigns a listen to ""Dark Side Of The Moon""'s vocal solo on ""Great Gig In The Sky"".  I couldn't have done it better myself.
  Great moments just fill the time here. When Black asks the class ""What's Rock all about?"", he gets answers like ""scoring chicks"" and ""getting wasted"", both of which he replied an emphatic ""NO!"" to. He then gets the answer he was looking for, and that's ""sticking it to the man"". Rock is about breaking the rules, and standing up to ""the man"". Nice work, Mr. Black.
  Early in the movie he asks the kids about their knowledge of legendary bands such as Led Zeppelin. They all look dumbfounded, and have no clue what language he's speaking. He continues to spit forth names, ""....Sabbath......AC/DC........MOTORHEAD!!!!!"", all of which are foreign to these kids. This is the point where he establishes time slots for teaching ""Rock appreciation"" and ""Rock theory"" classes. This is great stuff.

  If you want to see a factual, fun, and light hearted movie with some great Rock 'N' Roll.......go rent, or better yet, buy this one.

Jack Black is obviously having a great time in this movie - using his Tenacious D skills and his over-the-top humor with a really talented group of kids. (Actuallym, I found the DVD extras far more hilarious than the actual film. Black seems to be really genuine with the kids - not putting on a show.) In short ... funny film and don't miss the DVD extras",1091923200,2,496,4.177083333333333
1978453,3,B00018U9FW,"""School Of Rock"" is a surprisingly amusing movie, not only Jack Black fans or rock aficionados are going to enjoy this film, most of the people are going to find something appealing to them in ""School Of Rock"". The movie is a showcase for Jack Black, who proves with this comedy that he can be a very good lead actor in comedies.

 The plot isn't specially original, but the rock soundtrack and the original music in the movie are EXCELLENT, also a lot of jokes and rock references are simply great, for instance, check out the AC/DC guitarist (Angus Young) impersonation, or Peter Townshend's trademark arm swing when a kid plays the guitar, or when Jack Black rolls in the ground while playing a guitar solo, like Jimi Hendrix did.

 The kids actually are real musicians, and even though they are very young, they show an outstanding talent, also Jack Black is a very skilled musician and a charismatic singer as well, both Jack and the children perform their songs.

 During the movie, we can hear songs by groups that built the foundations of rock music, the music includes rock legends like Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, AC/DC, The Who, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Metallica, among many others, as well as a lot of great references to artists like Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Yes (by the way, check out the rock history diagram drawn in a blackboard, it's a great detail).

 Rock aficionados will enjoy ""School Of Rock"", as well as Jack Black fans, but the movie is funny enough to appeal to most of the people.",1091750400,,1517,4.634328358208955

The children in this movie are the best thing about it, and they make all of the funny scenes funny, not Jack Black. In fact, I think Jack Black is what holds this movie back from getting a higher rating from me. He was just not funny in this movie. However, the story is decent, although it has been done plenty of times before, and the kids in the movie are just fun to watch.",1091577600,,556,4.110091743119266
1978455,5,B00018U9FW,"Probably the absolute most hilarious and all around entertaining movies I have seen in 10 years. School of Rock was an absolutely brilliant movie that entwined a unique idea together with some amazing comedy to produce a movie that all ages can get a kick out of. It is not often that a movie can so effectively touch the funny bone of all ages, but School of Rock takes it to a whole new level.

The basic idea behind School of Rock is that Jack Black's character is a rocker that is down on his luck and manages to get himself a gig as a substitute teacher and eventually has the students making rock music and the movie escalates from there. Black will go unappreciated for his work in this movie most likely, but he has helped create a classic that will live on forever.

There is no one that will not find this movie entertaining if they sit back, relax and let Jack Black rock your face off.  This movie definitely deserves to knock the rock!",1091404800,,948,4.344632768361582
1978456,4,B00018U9FW,"I don't know how many of you are familiar with the career of Jack Black, but I first became acquainted with his work through his musical project ""Tenacious D"" through a friend, and have received much amusement from his antics since then. inclusive of collecting all downloadable music including rare and hilarious pieces like ""Sasquach"", ""Spiderman"", and a vocal version of the Star Trek theme - all of which they do perform at their concerts, incidentally. I was initially attracted by the cover featuring a rendition of Tarot Card # 15: ""The Devil"". When it comes to music, as anyone will inform you, Jack Black loves to, above all, ROCK. He tends to focus on the rather exaggerated and epic aesthetics reminiscent to that of the Spinal Tap and KISS spectacles with a musical bent partial to Led Zeppelin and AC/DC in particular with a contagiously exuberant effervescence and comedy-style conducive to an eternal man-child, which is always a pleasure to observe, and with the right person, even participate in.

 Now the lokian jester has Quang Jin Fong Amanahoed in another film {for those unfamiliar, he has also been an actor for a number of years, acting in primarily bit parts in releases such as ""Shallow Hal"" and ""Saving Silverman""} named ""School of Rock"" in which he plays a musician in need of some quick money - but being unemployed and recently ousted from his own band, who were basically jealous because he frequently ""stole the spotlight"" with his prolonged guitar solos and stage-diving antics; so from this, he seeks revenge upon those who did not appreciate his talent, subsequently garnering the cooperation of some 4th-graders to revive his Heavy Metal vision, by impersonating a ""Mr. Sneebley"", his room-mate, disillusioned ex-band-mate, and substitute teacher, intercepting a call intended for him.

 He eventually meets up with the Principal {Joan Cusack, whom you may recall as playing the role of the despicable ""Debbie Jilinsky"" from Addams Family Values}, and after a series of secret musical instructions, convinces her through charm and inebriation to allow his class to go on a specialized ""field trip"" for some Beethoven, but is really ""The Battle of The Bands"". So after determining each student's talent, places them to participate in the aptly named ""School of Rock"", and they perform marvelously despite the protests from horrified parents {who along with the Principal, learned that he was an imposter}, and a doubtful event promoter {whom Finn convinced to have them perform because they were dying from a rare disease - which sounded remarkably similar to ""stick it to the man""}.

 Quite a fun movie overall, and I also particularly enjoyed the ending sequence during the ""concluding jam"", as it were.

 The DVD includes a ""making of"" featurette , ""The Diary of Jack Black"" {in which he visits K.G. for an improvised session with the complete D!}, the kids' diary, the music video, previews, and an imploration unto Led Zeppelin, that they allow a song of theirs be included in the film, which it was.

 So there you have it - the character of Dewy Finn and Jack Black are not at all too far removed, and this film works around his personality.",1091232000,2,3184,4.956848030018762

Black puts on one of the most pleasing preformances in the movie and actually rocks out well. I'm surprised indeed, he wrote the lyrics and music for a few songs and they are very well done. Jack Black's character Dewey Finn teaches his 'snobby' private school students that you don't ahve to be conformed for people to like you, and to do what you like so that it pleases you, since that's what rock is. It's about the music. The students put up an enjoyable front as well and Black and the students have some real chemistry that was just fun. Overall the movie was funny, a little predictable, but very fun and one of those movies you just have to buy to watch all the time.

1978487,5,B00018U9FW,"""School of Rock"" was in a word BRILLIANT! I enjoyed every second. Original, witty and typical Jack Black comedy weave together with a fresh plot and of course, rock music, making this film a true delight and a great hour and a half to giggle.
Dewie (Black),  is a failed guitarist bagging off, negletting rent payments and tormented by a hideous girlfriend of his room mate and best bud. When forced to get a real job, Dewie convieniantly weaves hinself into a snobby elementory school where he is expected to subsitute for a particular class. Eventually, Dewie discovers that this particular class is full of very musically talented ten-year-olds. Here, Dewie cooks up a plan to get the entire class prepared for ""The Battle of the Bands"", a renowned Rock Music Competition. Thus, the School of Rock is created.
Overall, I thought this movie was wonderful! And surprisingly, there are fairly imported morals in this film (particularly some strong ones for any parents out there) that really give this film a senstive side. But, of course, our hero, Mr Black doesn't let mushy messages intrude on his comedy, which is HALARIOUS! As I said, very original, very funny, 10 out of 10.
And of course, this review cannot finish without mentioning the music. I love it. Being not a huge fan of rock, I kind of felt I learnt a bit of respect for the gods and goddesses of Rock. The music is fun, catchy, great melodies, and includes many old-school classics such as the timeless ""Fish Out of Water"". Music = 10/10!
""School of Rock"" is a great film jampacked with comedy, light morals, Jack Black and (der!) Music!! The little kiddy stars add a bonus delight to the true fun of this GREAT film! ROCK ON!",1089590400,,1694,4.684563758389261

If you heard stuff like this is Jack Black worst movie or it sucked thats what i heard. but i still wanted to see it cause im a fan and it was actually pretty goood. well anyways its about a failed musician Dewey Finn (Jack Black) who is freeloadin and living off and at one of his oldest friends house. His friends girlfriend  says if he cant get the money for the rent in a week he wil have to move out. His friend is a substitute teacher and one day a private school calls for him to sub and dewey ends up subbing there and making there stuck up private class into a school that rocks by having the whole class be in deweys rock band and plan on playing at the battle of the bands as long as the school doesnt find out or its deweys head literally ! its funny and makes u feel good a great movie for your kids 10 and up is a good age i think,1089072000,2,1191,3.9214876033057853
1978489,3,B00018U9FW,"One can't help notice Jack Black.  He's a human dynamo, a human version of the Tasmanian Devil.  This movie is formulaic right to the core, and Joan Cusack has yet again playing the second fiddle to the main character (why?)  It's about a dumped rocker who found a higher purpose in life, higher than himself and getting to appreciate the joy of serving others other than himself.  Naturally, all the young musicians here (ten years of age on average) are VERY talented musicians and they aren't musical instruments synching as the Milli Vanilli did.  They rocked, indeed.  Having said that, the movie wouldn't do without Jack Black's personality.  The movie got rather long-winded towards the end but overall, it's a light entertainment to be enjoyed on a rainy day or a quiet night at home.  The DVD version contained several interesting & watchable additional features such as spending a day with the young musicians during the Toronto Film Festival, MTV diary journal of Jack Black, Jack Black's plea to Led Zeppelin to use their song for this movie, interviews with all crew that is concerned.  It's interesting to note Jack Black's theatre background & his commitment for perfection & it would be intriguing to watch how he would fare in his part in Peter Jackson's King Kong.",1088812800,,1282,4.870967741935484

1978493,5,B00018U9FW,"School of Rock is the sort of comedy that reminds you why you still want to watch comedy, as Hollywood continues to produce fluff that sells because of star power, definetely not because of any humorous merit.
Jack Black is the Hollywood anti-hero - the lead man who isn't overly good-looking, can't play the serious role, isn't going to win any awards (other than from MTV), and moonlights as a rock star. But in School of Rock he puts in a epic role by comedic standards, mixing killer timing and hyperactivity with the ability to make scripted humor look natural.
This movie is about rock music. To be more specific, smart kids from a prep school playing rock, and their substitute teacher loving rock more than anything else in the world. The movie will make you laugh for hours and sing along to the catchy soundtrack, as well as continually making you want to do your best air-guitar performance mid-song. A great comedy for everyone to laugh along to and enjoy.
The DVD itself is great from a DVD-lovers' point of view. The anamorphic widescreen transfer is very clean, certainly up to the standard of movies made post-2000. The audio, seeing as music is crucial to this film, is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby formats, with the speakers coming into play for the concert and music scenes, and all dialogue is perfectly clear.
The extras on this disc are not in abundance, but there is a good amount for a comedy, and all the special features are actually worth watching, unlike most DVD extras. There is a commentary with Jack Black and Richard Linklater - your standard director/actor showing, with good film-making insight and memories. The Kids Kommentary is suprising fun and well put together. The kids are the key to this movie, the make-or-break if you will, and make good comments about making the film.
'Lessons Learned' is the standard cast interview featurette, basically advertising for the movie, but worth a listen. 'Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin' is an onstage begging to the remaining band members to ask for permission to use The Immigrant Song in the movie, nothing special but short enough to be worth a watch.
There is a video clip of the film's main song School of Rock, and a rather amusing MTV Diary of Jack Black, as he goes about a strange day in the life of Hollywood's anti-hero.
Hilarious film with Jack Black firmly in the spotlight and loving the attention, with a solid audio/visual transfer and good amount of extras. A great comedy to add to your DVD collection...",1088467200,2,2523,4.736363636363636

Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, an aspiring rock guitarist who's a bit down on his luck. A mere three weeks before the ""Battle of the Bands,"" Dewey finds himself a man without a band after the other members of No Vacancy kick him out, citing his tendency for mimicry of every rock guitarist cliche of the last 30 years.
As if things couldn't get any worse, roomate Ned's increasingly dominating girlfriend has begun pestering Dewey for the rent money.
It's then that Dewey decides that drastic measures are needed. When the principal of the prestigious Horace Green Elementary school calls looking to hire Ned as a substitute teacher, Dewey sees an opportunity to make some money in a hurry. He impersonates Ned, and begins a three-week stint as the substitute teacher of the fifth grade class at Horace Green.
Upon hearing the students play during music class, Dewey decides to start a new class project - Rock Band. The plan is to form a band with the kids, and enter the Battle of the Bands.
The movie works on several levels. For the adults, there are all of the recognizable references to thirty years worth of rock music. For the kids, Jack Black's manic antics, along with the great performances from the kids make it funny, and endearing, without ever getting sappy.",1087603200,,1533,4.745318352059925

This movie was not funny from start to finish because the ""Black"" shtick is wearing thin. How can this comedian play the same slacker over and over. He has no range at all. Hey, Bob Hope is overrated too. Also, the idea that smart kids learning nerdy stuff like classical music and algebra are creativly inhibited and unhappy is so completly wrongheaded, I couldn't bear to watch the poor little tykes go punk. Children should have the basics in youth. If they want to be rock stars and get laid, they ought to wait till they're at least 13.

1978521,5,B00018U9FW,"Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a 30-something musical wannabe who's never given up on his dreams of rock 'n' roll stardom, specifically winning the $20,000 grand prize at the local annual Battle of the Bands. A few teeny-tiny problems with that plan: he's arrogant, immature, and not much in the way of a singer, songwriter, guitar player, or responsible human being. He's a lot like Black's rock snob character in High Fidelity, just a little older, a (very) little wiser, but still a socially maladept loser.

And he's having a day the stuff that nightmares are made of. Dewey gets kicked out of his band. His wimpy roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White, who also wrote the screenplay), under the influence of a harpy girlfriend (Sarah Silverman, last seen lipping off in a parking lot before being clocked by Ryan Phillippe in Way of the Gun, and sporting a similarly endearing personality here) gives Dewey an ultimatum: get a ""real job,"" come up with current and back rent, or vacate the premises. The life of the true artiste is tortured by contact with small minds, y'know?

The phone rings, offering Ned a substitute teacher gig at Horace Green, a veddy correct, upper-crust prep-type elementary school. Dewey answers and sees the solution to his money problem. He poses as Ned, and is assigned his own class of young minds to shape. Spying on his students in music class, he sees they already have an accomplished keyboard artist, guitarist, etc. (albeit they only play classical) and a ""brilliant"" plan is born. Dewey will form them into his own personal band, teach them the hows and whys and joys of kickbutt rock 'n' roll, and go on to win the Battle of the Bands. Desperately inventing jobs for the students without musical skills, he tasks three girls to name the band. They exceed his wildest expectations with an ultra-cool and totally appropriate suggestion: The School of Rock.

Let's admit it right now: School of Rock is a formula movie. We know going in that Dewey will come to treasure the kids and vice versa, he'll grow in the process, the kids will also blossom under his unlikely tutelage, and in the end fun will be had by all (after the obligatory but easily overcome Moment When All Seems Lost). But that's unimportant. Blinding originality is not a prerequisite to have a good movie. I give School of Rock 5 stars not because it's great entertainment in a Citizen Kane way, but because it so perfectly accomplishes what it sets out to do: be a thoroughly enjoyable light comedy and star vehicle for Jack Black.

This is an amazingly sweet-tempered film. There are no real bad guys (well, except the Girlfriend From Heck, but Ned - the real Ned - needs to clue in and dump her for his own good anyway). The straitlaced, control freak school principal (Joan Cusack) could be the bad guy, and in a different sort of movie might, but in School of Rock she's instead a decent person who just takes her responsibilities way too seriously. (And I have to ask: when did Joan Cusack get so incredibly HOT? Did I miss something?) Job stress is killing her, and she knows it. When Dewey/Ned takes her on a not-date to a local pub, she gets a little tipsy and tells him, ""I wasn't always like this, you know. I wasn't always wound this tight. There was a time when I was fun. I was funny. I was.""

Jack Black brings immense energy and impeccable comedic timing to the role of Dewey Finn. Joan Cusack not only matches his skill at light comedy, but their characters have a surprising level of real chemistry going. I'd like to see these two together again, in a romantic comedy. The kids are appealing. Watching Dewey relate to them, dealing with all their ego problems, individual faults and talents, building them up, holding them together, becoming almost despite himself a real band leader and effective father figure/surrogate big brother, is a kick. This movie lives or dies on our liking all these people. Fortunately they're very easy to like.

In the end, everything works out (of course), the concert comes off like gangbusters, the kids have a great time, Dewey becomes a better person, and all is right in the School of Rock.",1086912000,,4148,4.690934065934066

However, Dewey has no interest in teaching, until he finds out that the students are exceptionally skilled with a number of musical instruments.  This leads to Dewey to initiate a secret school project that includes playing and learning about rock music.  School of Rock is an interesting comedy that displays how an exceptional teacher must love what he or she is teaching in order to engage his or her students.

1978525,4,B00018U9FW,"SCHOOL OF ROCK is SISTER ACT on steroids or qualuudes.  Jack Black charges into this role as if it were the most important role of his life...and although not a Black fan, one must give credit to the man for his enormous energy and spirit in playing the role of Dewey Finn.  Forgetting he's in a new century, Finn plays his guitar like a madman, copying all the great guitarists of the 70s and 80s.  Of course, an anachronism, his current band decides he's hurting them so they fire him.  Black meanwhile is mooching off his friend Ned Schneebly (the Opie-ish Mike White), and White's girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) wants Dewey out.  Dewey of course is one of those guys who wouldn't know a day's work if it fell on him.  Irresponsible, lazy, self-centered, just what you like in a rock and roller.  Anyway, Black intercepts a phone call meant for his buddy and ends up getting a substitute teaching job at a snooty prep school.  The principal is played by the immensely talented Joan Cusack and she is perfect in the part.  One doesn't get the impression she's acting at all.  (This role was Oscar worthy in the supporting category).  Of course, Jack ends up turning his class into a rock and roll band, along with groupies, managers, lights, etc.  He wants them to be his band in the big contest his former band thinks they will win.  The children, every one of them, are simply fantastic and are the true heart of the movie, along with Jack's fierce love of rock and roll.  Miranda Cosgrove, who plays the precocious Summer, is truly gifted, as are the young men who play Lawrence, Zack, Freddie and the one who wants to be a fashion designer.  I wasn't totally appreciative of ten year olds using profanity so freely, but it is the 21st century and pottymouths are everywhere!
SCHOOL OF ROCK is a feel good movie, with a surprise twist at the big contest, and the children are truly talented.

1978547,5,B00018U9FW,"School of Rock is a 21 Century rock driven musical comedy. It's got a great cast and works really well. Jack Black is the man in the movie and he finally gets to be himself.
Dewey Finn(Black) is a poor rocker. He freeloads off his good friend Ned(White). Dewey has no job and he constantly hears about it from Neds girlfriend Patty(Silverman). Dewey teases Ned about his job as a substitute teacher and it really angers Patty. She makes Ned give Dewey in ultimatum in that he must pay his share of rent by the end of the week or he's gone.
Dewey is desperate, so when a prep school calls the house looking for Ned to work there for a couple of weeks, Dewey sees a chance for a job and he takes it. Dewey arrives to the school and pretends to be Ned. He gets to his class full of 10 year olds and quickly hates them. He doesn't make them do anything and the kids hate him too. Principal Mullins(Cusack) is suspicious of the behavior, but doesn't do anything. In his second to third day into the job Dewey finds out the kids have music class. He hears there music down the hall and goes to investigate. He goes to the class and what he finds is a bunch of great young musicians. He has an idea, he can use them to win Battle of the Bands.
The winner of Battle of the Bands receives a 20,000 prize and Dewey is no longer in a band. When the kids come back to class he has rock instruments waiting for them. He assigns a couple of kids to play keyboard, guitar, bass, and drums. He then gets back up singers from more kids in the class. He's then giving kids assignments from groupies, stage crew, and security until everybody in the class has some kind of assignment. Not it's up to Dewey to see if he can educate these kids on rock and roll, not get caught, and to see if he can actually pull this off.
Jack Black is the absolute man in this movie. For those of you who don't know Black is in the crude humor band Tenacious D and they are fantastic. His character is similar to himself in real life and that's why he does so good. He has an amazing rock n roll voice and watching him teach these kids rock is great. This is the best movie Black has made to date and that because of a well written script and he gets to act like himself. He's a quite of funny guy and his fans should be well pleased with his role in this movie.
All the kids in the movie are great. The kids who play the instuments are real musicians and can play in real life what they play in the movie. You can tell all the kids loved working with Black by the enthusiasm they all show on screen. Movies with kids don't work if they can't connect with the adult star and that isn't the case in this movie. Black said in all his interviews how much fun he had working with them and the joy is displayed on screen. It really is fun watching them.
The music is School of Rock is great. All the original songs were written by Black and once again we get to see the talents of this rocker. There are a ton of classic rock songs in the movie and you have to laugh watching these kids play these classic tunes. The theme song to School of Rock is the best song in the movie. It really did get slammed by not getting an Oscar nomination. I heard one critic say they dont' nominate rock songs. That's balderdash because the year before Eminem won with Lose Yourself. School of Rock is a fantastic song that is my best song from a motion picture in 2003.
This is a feel good movie. It's Blacks best work to date. This is a comedy you can sit down and watch with the whole family. So be prepared to laugh and have a good time.",1084492800,4,3582,4.111269614835948

1978550,5,B00018U9FW,"You may not like Jack Black -- he is always too noisy, and often too annoying.  And in ""School of Rock"" he never changes -- the same old JB, who hangs around in your room only with underwear, who doesn't pay his share of rent.  But ""School of Rock"" is a different thing.  He is still loud, OK, but this time that makes the film better than you expect.
Because you know this guy Dewey Finn played by Jack Black, after all, turns out a charming fellow among the likable kids.  JB's Dewey, in need of ready cash, disguises himself as a substitute teacher in a posh prep school (run by uptight principle Joan Cusack) and instead of math, he ""teaches"" the spirit of rock'n'roll to the children.  Of course, it won't take long before they enter the Battle of Bands, leading us to rousing finale.
You may not like Jack Black's character at first, but as the film goes on, he starts to show unexpected side to his personality.  The monetary motive turns into genuine passion, and that is no news in Hollywood, but it is rarely done with such an energetic and hilarious performance as that from the leading actor.
The kids not only can play the instruments, but also they can act, and many of them are given due moments to impress us.  Also great is Joan Cusack's comic acting, perhaps better than that of the sexually repressed fiancee in ""In & Out.""  Now her character here has something repressed deep inside -- which is again related to music.  Her turn (supported by a glass of beer in a bar) is simply wonderful.
The script by Mike White (""Chuck and Buck"") who was JB's next-door neighbor knows how to extrect the better side of Jack Black's super-turbo comic turn. and though the story is not particularly unique, the result is a great success, especially when it shows the relations between the ""teacher"" and the students.  And director Richard Linklater (""Tape"" and many others) does not show his trademark off-beat feelings -- his handling of the material is surprisingly traditional, and that also helps greatly.
And most of all, this film is good-hearted, and is not afraid of showing that on its sleeve.  You can enjoy watching it with the good soundtrack, and when JB tries to teach the kids the riff of ""Iron Man"" and many 70s classic rock, you can feel his love of music.",1083888000,3,2278,4.54523227383863

He's been kicked out of his band and is facing eviction by his roommates when he decides to impersonate his friend, a substitute teacher, and try to make a few bucks.  As you'd expect, he's not much of a teacher -- UNTIL he discovers that his middle school charges are gifted classical musicians and he decides to indoctrinate them into the world of rock so they can participate in an upcoming Battle of the Bands.
The role was written for Black by actor-writer Mike White (The Good Girl), one of the most interesting screenwriters in Hollywood, and Black is perfect -- believably crotchety and endearing -- with a flawless supporting cast.  The kids, musicians found in band camps and similar venues, do a great job, while Joan Cusack as the school's uptight principal, and White and Sarah Silverman as Dewey's roommates, never hit a wrong note.
Directed by Richard Linklater (Clerks), the film is paced well, thoroughly enjoyable, and filled with great music, culminating in a great Battle of the Bands and a fun jam session over the closing credits.
DVD extras include a terrific commentary track with Black and Linklater (too bad White is missing); a commentary track with the kids; a 25-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that shows how funny Black is and how close the cast was; an hilarious pitch by Jack Black to Led Zeppelin; a music video; trailer; a 16-minute MTV diary; an 8-minute video diary of the kids at the Toronto Film Festival; and the film's awesome History of Rock chart, unfortunately available only to Windows users.

So we popped the DVD in, we were in a good mood, we just KNEW this movie was going to be funny. So what went wrong? I like Jack Black usually. But maybe it's because he's only good in small doses. Comedy is a matter of balance and timing, and Jack Black pours on his raging exaggerated characteristics to the hilt ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE! I don't even know if I can blame Black for this. The director should have known better. ""Dude, let's do that scene again, but tone it down a bit. You're coming off like a madman on crack."" Maybe the director was too scared to hold him back. Still, what's worse is the writing and the silly message the movie tries to get across. I don't even have kids, but if I did, a guy pretending to be a teacher and taking my kids off on ""field trips,"" and teaching them disrespect - well, let's just say that even though I knew this was ""only"" a fantasy movie, I couldn't stop thinking how crazy and unrealistic this would be in ""real life."" But yeah, since this is a movie, all ties up neatly in the end and everyone is happy that this crazy rock obsessed madman took the kids without permission in his van to perform ""rock"" concerts. Uh huh. Anyway, just an awful movie all around, and though the kids were cute (maybe kids like this sort of movie), it was overacted, badly written, and most of all, badly directed.

If Chris Farley were alive today,he would have been perfect for the character of Dewey Finn,portrayed by Black. Farley played characters like Dewey,semi-obnoxious but kind. The film was written by Mike White who plays Dewey's buddy and roommate Ned Schneeblee. The most famous of all is Joan Cusack who is Rosalie Mullins,the principal of Horace Green Elementary School. Dewey,a heavy metal band's frontman is fired from the band and worse,is threatened with eviction from his apartment that he shares with Ned and Ned's girlfriend. To pay back rent,Dewey,who had shaved off his beard,takes a teaching position at an elementary school where Ned teaches also. After Dewey arrives,using his buddy's name,the classroom is definitely not the same! The kids in the class aren't learning math and English much anymore. Dewey teaches each kid how to play the guitar and keyboard. Before too long,loud,hard rock is emerging from the classroom. This is brought to the prncipal's attention after receiving a complaint from another faculty member. Dewey and the kids hide all the evidence before the principal enters the classroom.

I would recommend this for the kids and anyone who enjoys ""head banging"" and appreciates the History of Rock. I thought it was fantastic how he got the kids to really appreciate the ""soul"" of music NO not SOULLLL music but the ""heart"" of Rock. He did abandon ALL STUDIES which doesn't say much. There were moments in this movie that I was having flashbacks of Sam Kennison but they were still hilarious.

He really does have a great rock voice, but his attempts at humor struck me as tired slapstick.  Several of the jokes were embarrassingly stale. For example, when he holds up three fingers and says ""read between the lines"" or when he rehashes the old Woody Allen Joke that ""those who can't teach, teach gym.""  There were other examples, but you get the idea.
In many ways this was a charming movie, but the message behind it was disturbing.  ""Stick it to the Man!""  Ok, why?  That is never explained, nor is it explained why that is supposed to be a good thing.  The kids portrayed are successful, respectful and disciplined--the kind teachers nowadays pray for but don't get.  He turns them into spoiled Hollywood brats--the kind of which there are all too many of in the media.  In one scene, a father is talking to his son and the son starts walking away.  ""Don't walk away when I'm speaking to you!"" says the father, and Black reacts as though the father had said something inappropriate.  Sorry, but when your parents (or anybody for that matter) are speaking to you, you don't walk away.  To point that out is good parenting, yet here it's treated as draconian oppression. In another scene, our hero gets a black girl to talk back and do that little stereotypical side-to-side head movement thing. What's the message behind that?
Talk to any teacher and they will tell you that the #1 problem is schools today is lack of respect and lack of discipline.  This movie wraps irresponsibility and rebellion in a cutesy veneer.  Whether that is to excuse the current situation or foster it is anybody's guess.",1083024000,8,1781,4.525

Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, a thirty-something rockstar wannabe who crashes at his friend Ned's (Mike White) place. His band just gave him the pink slip and Ned's girlfriend (Silverman) is pressing for him to move out (he hasn't paid rent in a loooong time). One day the phone rings. It's a high-up school looking for Ned to take a position as a substitute teacher, but it's Dewey who answers and assumes Ned's identity in order to make some much needed money.
While at school, Dewey finds out that the kids in his class can play some music, albeit it classical, and decides to enroll them in a rock band to enter a 'Battle of the bands' competition (unbeknownst to them). He turns the classroom into a rehearsal studio and teaches the kids how to become rock musicians. All of this behind the back of the school's principal, played by Cusack.
Black succeeds enormously in balancing his crazy rockstar persona with the subtleties of handling the children, and while he learns a lesson in responsibility by the end of the movie, he never betrays the true spirit of his character. The kids who play the students are simply amazing. I had never seen any of them before, so I'm guessing their acting experience is limited, but they give great performances across the board.
For me, the only weak spot of the film comes in the scenes between Black and Cusack. Usually a scene stealer, she comes out pretty subdued and boring in this film - maybe because her character demanded it - and it adds very little to the movie.
There are some great classic tunes in this movie and great musical references from Black (Led Zep, Hendrix, ACDC and a whole bunch of groups).",1082592000,2,1843,4.520958083832335

The movie also gets us back to what rock `n' roll is really all about. It's not the money or the fame, it's the music. You don't need the coolest image or the flashiest clothes to put on a great show, all you need is an undying love of music. This is a great inspirational movie for all ages. Kids will love it for the comedy and adults will even tap their foot to the beat of their favorite classic rock tunes.

Just a goofy, everyman...who is fun to watch and seems to enjoy what he's doing.  Black never takes a role where he has to stretch himself all that much and School of Rock is no different.
He plays Dewey Finn, a wannabe rock-n-roll star who gets kicked out of his own band.  What's more, under pressure from his ""witchy"" girlfirend, Finn's best friend and roommate wants him to come up with his rent money or move out.
Finn's roommate is a substitute teacher and one day gets a call from a prestigious prep school for a long-term sub job.  But Dewey takes the call and the job, pretending to be his roommate to make the rent money.
Dewey is content to give the kids recess all day long until he finds out that they are musically talented.  Suddenly he thinks he can put together a great rock band with the kids and with a $20,000 battle of the bands competition.
Telling the kids it's a ""school Project"" he begins working with the kids and teaching them rock music as opposed to the classical that they play in school.  For those not in the band, Dewey assigns them jobs such as security, roadie, groupie, and the pretty and snooty Summer gets the job as Band Manager.
The Bulk of the movie has Black teaching the kids rock while ducking the inquiries of the prim and proper principal played by Joan Cusack.
The movie is fairly formulatic..you've seen similar plots in movies like ""Mighty Ducks""  or ""Bad News Bears""  where a down and out guy rallies a group of kids and makes them believe in themselves and perform strongly.  Instead of sports though, this is done for the sake of music.

Director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Waking Life) in association with Paramount Pictures have put together a film that will have you rooting for its' anti-hero Dewey Finn (Jack Black) to ""overcome the Man"" and succeed in his quest for rock and roll recognition.
Dewey, a rock star wannabe, finds himself kicked out of the band that he started and about to be kicked out of his apartment, when lady luck steps in and offers him an opportunity to get things back on track again.  This opportunity comes in the form of having to pretend that he's his roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) in order to take a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious boarding school.  After duping the concerned principle (Joan Cusack), he is allowed to take over a classroom of fifth graders.  Finding himself ill prepared for the position, he shows no interest in teaching the kids until one day he finds that many are accomplished musicians.  This discovery leads him towards the possibility of creating a new band from them that will help him to gain the elusive award given at a battle of the bands competition that he so richly desires.  This is where the real fun begins as he takes on teaching his new curriculum Music 111: ""All Things that Rock"" to a less than interested bunch of kids.
This film merits four out of five stars.  This rating comes from the film's ability to instill a breath of fresh air to the comedy genre due to its' unique subject matter.  Mike White also deserves special credit for writing a script that allows Jack Black to display his range of comedic and musical skills.

An unorthodox character poses as a teacher to make some cash and in the process connects with the students via a universal theme.  The crazy teacher here is Jack Black, of ""High Fidelity"" fame, and those who are fans of his over-the-top comedy should not be disappointed with his perfromance here.  There is something endearing about his character's fight against mediocrity, even though he is as mediocre as they come.  Well, try as I might not to enjoy this fairly cheesy comedy about a bunch of kids studying to put on a rock show, by the end of the movie I had to admit that it was fun.  While certainly not cerebral by any means I was rooting for the children to pull it off.  What is great about these kids is that they can actually play their instruments well, and some can sing beautifully.  This is that rarest of films, a children's ensemble.  I'm including Jack Black in that his child-like enthusiasm eventually carries the ridiculous film to its upbeat conclusion.  This is not a masterpiece of cinema, to be sure, but it is a fun time.

I loved everything about this movie:
The plot - Rock and Roll freak kicked out of his band an needing rent money, and a way to get back into a ""Battle of the Bands"" contest, happens upon the chance to earn cash posing as his roommate and begins teaching at a private school.
The FUN - A cast of great kids combined with an amazing script.
The background - A school where kids aren't allowed to be kids.
The Message - Chasing your dream is NOT a waste of time.  In fact, doing so, can make time stand still...if only for a moment.  I just thought that up, pretty good huh?

What can I say...I think this movie's argument is nice, it's ok, but let me put it this way: if it wasn't for JB this would be an ordinary movie wich we would quickly forget and ignore. Well, I think if this movie was headed by... for example, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, or even Jim Carrey, would be an ok movie, entertaining, but not that awesome to watch it on the cinema or even buy the DVD. It would be maximum a movie to rent on one boring afternoon. But this is not the case!! What JB does, is making this movie one of the best comedies of this year! He transforms this movie in a pure show!
I knew his work on Tenacious D and I knew he was a talented singer and a funny guy, but come on...he rocks! And this is just the start JB needed to be the next great star in Hollywood and believe me, many Oscar nominations for him are on the way, write this!
Conclusion: Your dog died or you grades weren't good enough, your girlfriend dumped you or whatever and you need to cheer up...well, this is the one for you. You won't regret it, believe me!
Just to give you an example of the originality of this one, I'll tell you the movie keeps going while the credits are passing on the screen, and for your surprise, JB mentions that, sayng: ""the movie is ending and we're still here...the credits are passing"" and points ramdomly at the credits and says: ""you see the name of this guy here, well and don't know him"", and he says this while rockin' his guitar...well, just to show you you'll have nice and original comedy righ until the end.

Unable to hold a job, Jack is pressured to pay up or get out by his best friends wife (Jack rents a room from them).  Other than his music, Jack has no ambition towards work until he happens to answer the phone from his friend.  It seems a school needs a substitute teacher and will pay well for Jack friend's services.  Jack pretends to be his friend and goes to the school posing as his friend.
The school happens to be a very upscale and exclusive private school.  What happens the rest of the movie is totally unrealistic, but entertaining nonetheless.  Jack is assigned a class and he sits in the front of the class being totally obnoxious with the kids and teaching nothing.  By chance he happens upon a few of the kids in music class and realizes that they have talent.  He cooks up the idea that he will be able to teach the kids how to play rock music and then go to the battle of the bands contest with the class.
If you can dismiss how such a prominent school doesn't verify the creditionals of its faculty (they don't ask for a driver's license, social security card, etc. that jobs are required to hire you), can't hear the loud music blaring down the halls, uncaring parents, etc., then the movie itself is highly entertaining",1081468800,,1353,4.384

""School of Rock"" is of the made-for-TV genre, barely enough ""meat"" for a half hour sitcom. It is formulaic: misfit makes good. So what else is new?
The haphazard and frenetic quality of this movie was wearying to me. I could not wait for it to be over...in fact, I do not know why I even finished watching it. I guess it was because I was watching it with other people. At one point, I actually dozed off.
The characters are mostly underwritten, unbelievable (except for the kids), and unlikable caricatures who are barely even funny. Jack Black's acting is so over-the-top and hyped-up that his character quickly grows tiresome. I see that several other reviewers feel the same way as I do on this point.

If you really can't stand him, you still might like this film.
If you kinda like him, you'lll really enjoy this film.
If you LOVE Jack Black...this could possibly be your ""Citizen Kane.""
The film is a Jack Black film for the masses...it celebrates his eccentricities yet somehow makes him lovable. It's a fairly standard ""beloved teacher"" film...the kind with the outsider teacher whose unorthodox methods are initially met with disdain by the students, their parents and school administrators.
In the end, as always, the teacher wins out.
The tweak here is that Mr. Black is not a real teacher, and his methods involve ""rocking out."" And the word ""rock"" must be pronounced ""RAWK"".
In standard ""teacher film"" mode, he brings out the best in his students, whether it be in a ""face-melting"" guitar solo, or genius-level computer-designed light shows.
Richard Linklater displays a gentle touch he's never displayed before, but still manages to be a bit subversive and snarky. You're carried along so effortlessly that when the time comes to ""name the band"", it's perfectly obvious but you honestly never considered it until that moment.
Good movies entertain you even when you ""know where they're going."" This movie is telegraphed by the opening credits, yet you're still surprised from time to time.
Jack Black rules the show, and he does 'act' here. Yes, his manic rock-star flailings are what you'd expect, but the smaller scenes with the kids or with Joan Cusack somehow DON'T feel like they're from a completely different movie (as usually is the case).
The supporting cast is fine as well. Mike White, his beleaguered roommate (and the film's author) and Sarah Silverman (a delicious harpy) are note perfect. Joan Cusack gives her usual inimitable performance...I think what she's doing is taking the classic wacky ""Joan Cusack"" character, and expanding in certain directions to fit each film she's in. She's never boring.
The children are amazing. They really play, and play really well. They're funnier than all get out. It's easy to root for them.
My only quibble is that the bass player gets minimal screen time, but maybe that's part of the joke.
The bass player is ALWAYS overlooked in rock bands, aren't they?
If the singer of the rival band sounds familiar, he's the original 'Roger' from the musical ""Rent"", Adam Pascal.
You can see all the disparate elements coming together by the end of the movie...like I said, ""telegraphed""...but it's a joy to watch.
This is a great rock movie AND a great family movie.
Name another one that fits both categories.

1978646,3,B00018U9FW,"Jack Black is the new Chris Farley/John Candy/John Belushi. He's the fish out of water trapped in a world where all fat comics are out of control, slightly disturbed (or disturbing) funnymen who pulverize their surroundings while needling the audience with a knowing half-smile. So it goes with ""School Of Rock,"" a vehicle tailor made for this kind of physical comedy. Since Black, as a beautiful loser manchild, is perfectly suited for this kind of format, it stands to reason that ""School Of Rock"" is not as bad as it would be without someone as manic for the lead would have made it.
I do have a slight problem with the kids, as they are as unhip a bunch as could be gathered together as characters. Let's face it, for the most part I hated my parents' music by the time I was in High School. So to insist that the students would suddenly find themselves grooving to the likes of Yes or Hendrix is little more than a boomer parent's fantasy of what kids would be suckered into if they'd only hear some REAL classic rock music. This is not to say the child actors here aren't lovable, in fact they help to balance Black in some of his more grating moments.
Joan Cusak is also, as usual, delightful. The scene where she gets sweet talked into the field trip by Black while listening to Stevie Nicks is a hoot. Screenwriter White has the kind of understanding for this material that Chris Columbus and Cameron Crowe bring to a lot of their films. While I can't give this the kind of total Rock and Roll endorsement that I would give to the likes of ""Almost Famous,"" ""Saturday Night Fever"" or ""Rock and Roll High School,"" it did make ""School Of Rock"" a pleasantly laughable afternoon's comedy viewing.
PS. The extra scene of Black begging Led Zepplin is worth the price of the DVD.",1080691200,2,1780,4.496913580246914
1978647,2,B00018U9FW,"I was eager to rent this movie, because I think Jack Black is a really talented guy.  Unfortunately, I was really disappointed by his performance in this film.
Have you ever been around someone who tries to be funny and, when he realizes folks ain't laughing, he laughs all the harder himself, jostling you with his elbow, almost as if to intimidate you into laughing?  That's Jack Black in this movie.  He gets off on the wrong foot and never seems to get on the right one.
The character of Dewey is supposed to represent some kind of anti-hero, but he comes off as a poor borderline-homeless guy burned out from drugs and never growing beyond his glory days of youth.
And since he's so interested in turning on the kids to rock (which is understandable, because these kids have apparently never been exposed to it!), he could have at least moved beyond the 70s.  I LOVE rock music from ALL periods, and Dewey slighted these kids by teaching them that music progressed to the day of AC/DC (a band I love, by the way) and then came to a screeching halt.  How ironic... Dewey would be the first one to protest if someone pointed out to him - truthfully - ""Dude, you've become your parents.""
I would have had more sympathy for the Jack Black character if he'd acknowledged to these kids the existence of great rock & roll music produced SINCE the 70s by artists such as U2, David Bowie, The Clash, Radiohead, Oasis, Bob Marley, Alanis Morsette, REM, Ultravox, Midnight Oil, Nick Cave, Siouxie and the Banshees, XTC, Bad Brains, The Smiths, Nirvana, Talking Heads, Pretenders, Roxy Music, X, Metallica, Depeche Mode, Tom Petty, Pearl Jam, Blondie, Elvis Costello, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, the Indigo Girls and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Did you ever see the Simpsons episode where the guy tells Mr. Burns, ""You're living in the past, man!  Contemporize!""  Some good advice for Dewey.
The kids were pretty likeable but couldn't compensate for the film's shortcomings.  If you're a huge fan of Black's and believe that nothing good has come out of the music world since 1979 (and there's nothing wrong with that), then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  Really, it's for middle-aged adults, not kids.",1080691200,7,2209,4.716883116883117
1978648,3,B00018U9FW,"I wonder if they could redo this movie and take advantage of the opportunity to make it funnier. After just loving the humor of Jack Black in Shallow Hal I was dissappointed in this DVD.
The potential lies in the concept of teaching students about rock and roll, yes Jack Black as an improptu substitute teacher without a clue is really a kick. There are so many 'duh.....' lines at the beginning that are funny. Yet, there was way to little humor for this comedy lover.
I have a friend who sometimes will talk with others while playing his guitar, this is funny, cute, yet it got old.
Seeing the talented young people was also very fun, interesting. The good voices, drumming, strumming and when they bring it all together was enjoyable.
I would not say it is really a family movie, some may want to prescreen for the kiddos, yet there is definately a lot of potential. Maybe Jack Black can do a sequel and really bring out his character",1080691200,2,938,4.491228070175438
1978649,5,B00018U9FW,"""School of Rock"" was written by the increasingly prolific screenwriter and actor Mike White.  Here, White shows that such eye-openingly good works like ""The Good Girl"" (with Jennifer Aniston) and the critically acclaimed ""Chuck and Buck"" were no flukes.  For the first time since ""High Fidelity,"" Black is given material that suits him.  Credit White for writing and building a movie around Black's talents.  And if you think that sounds easy, go talk to makers of ""Shallow Hal"" and other Black miscastings.
From an acting perspective, there's Black above all others.  White modestly stays in the background.  His girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman) is pretty much a one-note shrew (that's the role written for her).  Joan Cusack is great when she appears - her little moment gathering herself alone in a hallway in face of an onslaught of parents is the movie's one bit of dramatic acting.  The kids are really superb.  I assume that's really them playing those instruments.  There's none of the tricky camera work when musical fakery is involved (shots of the head, shots of the hand).  You get full body shots - guitarist Zach (Joey Gaydos Jr.) expertly working the chords, keyboardist Lawrence (Robert Tsai) dexterously working up and down the scales.
As far as Black is concerned, I don't think this is acting at all.  This role appears to be him to a 'T'.  Credit Mike White for envisioning a really cute, smart movie around that thought.",1080518400,,1443,4.937759336099585

Jack Black is who he is and we find that pretty funny, but we can see how others might not.  And I think Joan Cusack makes everything she is in even better.
The kids in the class Jack Black is subbing for are all charming and do a fine job being transformed from a bunch of preppy uniforms into a rock band (of sorts).  Of course the premise is implausible and every objection you can raise about the reality of this film is probably true.  But I would reply that you might benefit from lightening up and just having fun.  I know we did.  We laughed and we enjoyed saying, ""Yeah, RIGHT!"" at the more ridiculous plot points.

1978663,1,B00018U9FW,"This web site told me I couldn't post this review without assigning it stars.  But I was.  I was trying to assign it zero.
The trailers for this movie made it look good for a couple of entertaining hours.  It's not good for even that, or anything else.  You may have seen enjoyed seeing Jack Black host Saturday Night Live or appearing on some talk show.  Beware: this is NOT the Jack Black you'll see in ""School of Rock.""  Here is timing is horrible, his outbursts forced, his physical ""comedy"" lacking, and his delivery extremely unfunny.  What a disapointment.
As you know, the movie shows what happens when a hip rockster, played by Black, encounters a group of uptight prep school kids who have never been exposed to the mind-expanding power of rock music.  So Black - the latest model of the old Hollywood staple, the funny, loud, fat guy - tries to set them straight.
Don't get me started on the ""acting"" in this movie.  The interaction between adults in this film is just awful (although Joan Cusak is OK).  Poor dialogue and poor acting don't mix. Things are a bit better between Black and the kids are a little better, but mostly because the kids are cute and not because of any actual chemistry.
But ultimately it is Jack Black that sinks this film to the bottom of the septic tank.  His character steamrolls his way through the film, thoughtlessly imposing his pitiful world vision on schoolchildren at the expense of their well being.  Instead of coming off as the boorish, out-of-control cretin you can't help but love, he just seems awkward and stupid.  Absolutely horrible.  If the Oscars had an award for Worst Actor, Black would've won it running away.  Has the director of this film ever heard of the phrase ""Cut!  Can we do that one again?""
On a deeper level, something about the basic premise of this film really bothers me.  The prep school kids are supposed to be on the straight and narrow path that subordinates one's heart to one's sense of duty.  Black's character is supposed to represent the free spirit who can't be tamed who has come to liberate the kid's minds.  But what is Black really trying to foist upon these repressed, knowledge-hungry kids?  Let's consider.
What appalls Black's character about these kids initially is not their ignorance of rock, but rather of ""classic rock.""  (A bumper sticker idea: CLASSIC ROCK IS NEITHER)  The film suggests that kids who aren't listening to music that came out 25 years before they were born are square, repressed, and unhappy.  Wow!  For better or worse, kids listen to Eminem and Blink 182 and 50 Cent and so on.  There's a word for kids that listen to the same music their grandparents did: NERDS.  Think of it.  I'm 40, so that means when I was a kid I listened to Elton John, The Eagles, Heart, The Temptations, and whatever else they played on the radio.  If some dude came to my class and started lambasting us because we weren't hip to Peggy Lee, the Mills Brothers, Frank Sinatra, Vic Damone and so on, we would've laughed him out of the room.  And rightfully so!  This horrible film, which tries to pass itself off as radical, is actually about as reactionary as you can get.
Lest you think my assessment represents some spiteful vendetta against this movie, let me say that the group of friends I saw this movie with all though the same thing. Count this with Mel Gibson's ""Signs"" as one of the most incomprably bad movies you're likely to see.
To summarize: It would be one thing to make a film with the theme of ""Let the kids be kids.""  The theme of this film is ""Force the kids be like a 30-year-old burnout who can't stop living in the past.""  That is probably the opposite of what everyone who sees this movie expects.

Entertaining : 5/5 This movie keeps you in your seat and moves very quickly, yet it isn't too short. You leave wanting to see more band performances.

After reading the reviews here I was expecting so much more with this movie, but was flatly disappointed.  The kids were cute, yes, and Joan Cusack did a fantastic job, yes, but that was as good as the movie got.  Oh, and the jam session during the closing credits was pretty good as well.
First off, Jack's character (Dewey) was just unlikable.  There was nothing that had me rooting for the guy.  He was deceitful, greedy, and unloving.  Worst off, he just wasn't all that funny.  There was one scene that actually made me laugh out loud... but I laugh easily so this isn't saying much.  And it is most definitely not a reason to keep handing this guy lead roles.  Supporting cast... yeah, he does great there.  But lead role?  He is not of that caliber.  Leave that to the pros.
Second, the story was too unbelievable.  I can handle a little bit of make-believe, but this had you saying, ""Yeah, right!!"" throughout most of the movie.  Basically because you've got an IDIOT who dupes a school of geniouses into thinking he is the real thing.  If the top private schools were this easily dupes I would never have served detention in the public schools I attended.

Jack had been in the ""Music"" biz a while ago and a member of a band, but had gotten cut recently.  His passion was music and his goal was to enter battle of the bands.  He situated all the kids and taught them music.  He was the main singer, along with ""Turkey Sandwhich"" the big fat black girl who had the Arethra Franklin sounding voice, the two cute back up singers, the radical guitarist, the bass guitar, the ""hot"" drummer, and the classical chinese piano player.
The movie is hysterical despite of what anyone says.  This is an adorable movie for people of any ages to enjoy.  Typical Jack movie.  One of my mom's favorites.",1079913600,,1071,4.395939086294416

Looking only to get paid and practice for the coming Battle of the Bands, Black masquerades as a teacher and uses the children to play back up instruments and vocals.  Of course there is the obligatory sentiment that comes with these types of movies.  Black and the elementary school kids bond, while learning about themselves and each other between wisecracks.
Black just misses greatness in this film because there isn't enough of him.  An out-of-nowhere talent, Black's best days are on the horizon.

1978695,4,B00018U9FW,"I don't like Jack Black.  I don't like Jack Black.  I don't like Jack Black.
Okay, well, maybe I didn't like Jack Black before.  But a friend made me sit down and watch ""School of Rock"" -- which I enjoyed MUCH more than I thought I would -- and maybe I can rethink my opinion now.
Jack Black has always been the type of ""comedic actor"" that got on my nerves -- too spastic, too idiotic, about as funny as a tennis ball.  But what's always a nice surprise is finding an actor/comic who, when put in the perfect role (in this case, one written for him), shines like a beacon.
Dewey Finn is a lover of true rock music who has just been kicked out of the band he created for his wild antics onstage (aka displaying his mediocre talent so outrageously, it overshadows the rest of the band, making them look bad).  In desperate need of the rent money before his roommate's anal-retentive girlfriend gets him kicked out of the house, Dewey accidentally intercepts a phone call for his substitute-teacher roomie ... and ends up with a teaching job at a private (snooty) grade school where he is completely out of his element.  Simply there to kill time and collect a check, Dewey shows a real interest in his students only when he finds out some of them are musically inclined.  Conning the children into thinking it's a school project, Dewey gets the ""brilliant"" idea of using the kids to form a rock band -- eventually calling themselves The School of Rock -- that he will use in the local Battle of the Bands competition to beat the snot out of his old band.  All he has to do is keep the ""project"" secret from the school's principal, Ms. Mullins (the underrated comic genius that is Joan Cusack), an uptight and by-the-book administrator -- and make sure the kids don't blab to their parents.
The scenes of Dewey putting together the band are some of the funniest in the film - the class of ten and eleven-year-olds includes roadies, groupies, back-up singers, an effeminate warddrobe person ... even a band manager.  Dewey's lessons in the history of rock -- and in the playing of rock -- are done by Black with such intensity and over-the-top energy, I spent probably half the film thinking he was going to explode.
Does it come together in the end?  Will Dewey's HIGHLY ILLEGAL impersonation of a ceritifed teacher (let alone that it's his roommate) be discovered?  Are the kids any good?  And just what is Ms. Mullins' secret regarding Stevie Nicks?
All is revealed in this very funny, highly-entertaining comedy.  Jack Black is perfect in the role of Dewey Finn, a rock and roller who loves to play simply for his passion for music -- a sentiment he manages to inspire in his kids as he teaches them to ""fight the man.""  Joan Cusak leads a supporting cast that includes some very talented kids, in a film that makes you feel good, and may even make you shed a tear or two (without being weepy or overly sentimental).  Worth watching and worth owning on DVD -- even for non-Jack Black fans who may slowly be turning their opinions around (ahem) - ""School of Rock"" does indeed rock ... and if Mr. Black will make more films like this, in my opinion he'll ROCK, too.",1079827200,,3164,4.506993006993007

My friend who was with me at the time had the same feeling and criticized me for buying it, certain that it would be a lame movie. Boy were we wrong!
It only took a few minutes for us to realize that this movie was going to be hilarious. We laughed so hard our stomachs hurt at the end of the movie. Quick summary: Jack Black is a loser guitar player who gets kicked out of his band and then steals his roomate's long-term substitute teaching job at a private school to help pay the rent. When he finds out that the kids have to take a music class, he watches them for a few minutes and decides to start his own band with the students to play in the Battle of the Bands.

1978698,2,B00018U9FW,"If you don't expect a lot from Richard Linklater as a filmmaker, you should. Although somewhat absent for awhile, Linklater makes the kind of movies that feel like old friends. It could be that his style is changing since becoming a father, or perhaps he should not have gotten on board with this movie in the first place since it may have been the script or Jack Black that were problematic. From the start, ""School of Rock"" seems like a star vehicle for Black; defeated musician finds his niche marauding as a teacher; this caters to Black's talents. Although it's a matter of taste, he doesn't seem right for a lead role yet. One area where Linklater usually stands out is picking good little-known actors, and he did so here with some really cute kids. But, there weren't any great lines or memorable scenes, so cute kids is all that really stood out about the movie. As a sidenote, the commentary with Linklater and Black is pretty good.  I would recommend a similar movie, ""About a Boy,"" instead.",1079568000,,1002,4.629213483146067
1978699,5,B00018U9FW,"It sounds like such a high-concept Hollywood crap movie: a slob fakes his way into a job as a substitute teacher, teaches the kids about rock music, forms a band, plays at the big competition. And along the way the slob cleans himself up and the kids get solid life-lessons as the slob realizes he was born to be a role-model, right?
Not even close! ""School of Rock"" isn't some formula cookie-cutter movie. It slamdances around every potential pitfall and triumphs. ""School of Rock"" is one of the few movies that kids and adults will both love, sometimes even for the same reasons.
Why is ""School of Rock"" so cool? Let me count the ways...
1. Jack Black is turned loose, and who knew? He's a natural with kids. He never once dumbs down his persona - instead, if anything, he cranks it up a notch, and proves he can be endearingly obnoxious without being cloying, which is a rare gift.
2. Jack, and the movie, takes rock music seriously. Dewey Finn, Jack's character, talks about rock as if it's a vital component of his soul. By the end of the movie, you'll agree.
3. The kids aren't trapped into Disney formulas - they're real kids, with dimensions and a certain wisdom. They also take the music seriously.
4. The supporting cast, which includes KG (of course) and a fabulous turn from Joan Cusack, is uniformly good. Joan's character is treated with such entertaining tact that I just wanted to hug the filmmakers!
5. Even the ENDING avoids cliche and stays true to the lessons, and anarchic heart, of the movie.
Oh yes, and ""School of Rock"" is really funny. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it. Bring a lighter - you will most definitely want to raise it in the air by the end!
P.S. Why is this movie PG-13? It is suitable for any kid who can handle network TV.",1079481600,2,1755,4.470404984423676
1978700,5,B00018U9FW,"Sure there were some slow parts to this film about a struggling musician posing as a prep school teacher, but when all was said and done it was one of the funniest, wittiest, movie comedies of the year.
Jack Black is hilarious in his role as a failed musician hoping to latch on to someone for the upcoming battle of the bands.  When his friend and his friend's girlfriend threaten to kick him out because he can't come up with the rent, he poses as a substitute teacher.  Originally he thought that it would be an easy $650 a week, but soon he realized that this might also be his way into the competition.  When he discovers the kids are musically talented, he brings in his instruments and preps them for the battle of the bands.
The kids are adorable and talented, there's no doubt.  They play off of Black's character very well.  While his character starts off with selfish needs, he soon grows into a well-rounded individual who truly cares about the students he's working with.  The kids are typical children, generally selfish also, but occasionally unsure about how talented they are.  It takes Black to make them realize their gifts.
This is a feel-good movie that will have you laughing out loud more then a few times, and possibly tearing up at the end.  I can't imagine why someone wouldn't love this film.",1079481600,2,1319,4.582978723404255

1978725,5,B00018U9FW,"I'm just going to put it out there and say that this is my favorite movie of all time.  It sounds so clichd, and yet it's so true.  Jack Black plays his role perfectly, it could not have been done by anyone else.  What makes this movie so special is that it is completely hilarious, and yet has a great message for the viewer to remember.  Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, an overage rocker that sleeps in late, doesn't have a job, never had a job.  One day he answers the phone from a local prestigious elementary school, looking for a substitute teacher after the current teacher broke her leg and called out for the next couple of weeks.  He pretends to be his roommate, who is a certified teacher, and makes winners out of the students.  They are highly talented in music, and incredibly smart.  But, many of them don't have much faith in themselves.  One feels she's overweight, one thinks he's a loser, and so on.  Jack just just goes into the classroom and reverses their attitudes around.
This is a movie that everyone should go out and see.  Whether you like rock music, talented musicians, solid acting, or even a good comedy, this movie has got it all.  One of the best I've seen in years, if not the best i've ever seen, period.",1079222400,2,1236,4.39647577092511
1978726,4,B00018U9FW,"Jack Black really carries this movie. With his crazy eyebrows and constant jumpiness, it's hard not to find this guy funny. It's amazing to see him in full swing, dancing around like a monkey and shouting out lines that normally wouldn't be that funny-- but they are hilarious coming out of HIS mouth. He really knows how to work the lines of a script, squeezing out as much funny as he possibly can. Without Black, I think the movie would've snowballed.
Black stars as Dewey, a musician who is kicked out of his group in the beginning of the film. His roommate Ned (Mike White, who also wrote the movie) has always liked Dewey, but his manipulative girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) makes him think the same things she does-- that Dewey needs to either get a job or move out. So that's exactly what Dewey does. He poses as a teacher for a prestigious prep school, pretending to be the substitute teacher that Ned actually is. Dewey soon learns that the kids have more to offer than just proper English and poise-- they can really rock!
It's charming and sweet, and the kids are absoultely adorable. We're provided also with a great mix of children who all have different thoughts and talents. Together, they make a terrific ensemble, and with Dewey as the ring leader, it's completely rocking with hilarity.
This one is worth checking out. Everyone needs to loosen up once in a while, and this is the kind of movie that will make you want to do just that. There's no reason to sit up straight all the time-- so smile and slouch while you watch this movie!",1079222400,,1551,4.562724014336918

I laughed throughout the movie and was never bored (as I usually get during any movie).  If you like classic rock, you definitely should see this movie just for Black's rock-history lesson.  If you like to laugh and enjoy a 'cute' movie every now and then, you definitely will be happy with this one!  As for the reviewer who compared this to ""Lost in Translation,"" to put it bluntly, ""Lost in Translation"" was BORING compared to ""School of Rock.""",1079222400,,606,4.626168224299065
1978728,5,B00018U9FW,"I recommend this as the greatest movie of last year.  Like Forrest Gump, it is a comedy which is also an allegory for profound truths.
The metaphors that represent the profound truths reveal themselves if you make one simple adjustment in your mind before watching the movie. Substitute the word ""Love"" for ""Rock"" in the movie title.  The title now is School of Love.
Early in the movie, the main character Dewey Finn played by actor Jack Black tells the members of his old band who had just kicked him out, ""To read between the lines,"" while disguising a crude hand gesture. That line is also an invitation to the audience to see the spirit of the story.
Dewey Finn is an ersatz Jesus Christ. There is one key scene in the movie when Dewey makes a statement that the movie audience knows to be true and beautiful but all the adult characters in the movie scene, except for Dewey, take as perverse and blasphemous.  In the Gospels, Christ made many statements that were either interpreted as true and beautiful, or as perverse and blasphemous.
This movie is a perfect story to illustrate the mystery and love one experiences when undertaking a heroic mission as Joseph Campbell described in his classic book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Almost every line and lyric of the movie relates to its theme of having the courage to live a genuine life based on your inner passion.
If you have plans to see Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, I suggest you very soon afterwards watch School of Rock (a.k.a. School of Love). After a depiction of a heroic mission to teach Love through the endurance of tremendous suffering, you will find the depiction of a heroic mission to teach Love through the experience of music and humor to be a wonderful, uplifting contrast.
School of Rock (or Love) demonstrates how God makes it possible to enjoy life at its fullest by having the courage to undertake and complete a heroic mission to serve others. The children in the movie become heros and heroines under the guidance of a crass, humorous, outrageously lovable teacher Dewey Finn, who has no home of his own and is a subtly disguished, mirror image metaphor for Jesus Christ. Just as Leonardi da Vinci's journals were decoded by holding a mirror to a page, Christ is revealed by seeing Dewey Finn's traits and actions in mirror image.
The fact that makes this movie a great rock opera is that it is not over until the fat, gentle man has sung his solo. You may be very tempted to watch the movie again to look for some aspect of this piece of art that you missed. I watched it a second time and laughed even harder over details I missed the first time. One such detail is in the long shot as the kids' band takes the stage for their encore at the band contest. Watch very closely and you will see the chunky kid who is the security detail for the School of Rock punch in the stomach the slinky, snakelike guitarist who had replaced Dewey in his original band and who had tried to seduce the exuberant, naive principal of the kids school. This is the same kid who earlier had pleasantly made fun of her in the school hallway and got away with it.
School of Rock is a movie that you cannot afford to miss if you hope to maximize your ability, and the ability of those you love, to completely enjoy the adventure of being alive.
Be sure to watch the Special Features on the DVD titled ""Lessons Learned in 'School of Rock,'"" and ""MTV's diary of Jack Black.""  Both humorously present additional valuable truths with respect to the production of the movie and the power of a playful, grateful, and loving attitude in real life.",1079136000,,3613,4.52833078101072

1978731,5,B00018U9FW,"'School of Rock' is, in my opinion, one of the best movies in 2003. It's funny, cute, a bit of a musical, and heartwarming - all without being too preachy.
Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a member of a rock band that's just about to make it big - except for one thing. Dewey's always messing up their shows by doing crazy tricks and trying to act cool, but he's really coming off as an idiot. When he gets kicked out of the band and needs to pay his roommate $2,200.00, he needs to find a way to make money...fast. So he poses as a substitute teacher at the best elementary school in New Jersey - and when he sees the kids playing in band class one day, he gets a great idea. Why not have the KIDS play as his band, and he can enter the Battle of the Bands contest. He's sure to win!
This movie is hilarious...it has a bit of dirty humor (including lines like ""I have a hangover. Does anyone know what that means? It means I have a headache, and the RUNS!""), but I don't think it deserves the PG-13 rating. Everyone in the movie has talent - they act, sing, and play their own instruments. (I was more impressed by the kids' performances in this movie than the adults. They all seem so...real. Not like the characters in teen comedies.)
The extras are great. I haven't seen all of them yet, just the 'School of Rock' music video, the kids audio commentary, 'Lessons Learned in School of Rock,' and the video diary of the kids' trip to the Toronto Film Festival. I highly recommend this DVD.

1978754,5,B00018U9FW,"I found this film to be extremely funny and worth repeated viewings.  Directed by Richard Linklater, who also did Slackers (1991), Dazed and Confused (1993), and SubUrbia (1996), The School of Rock (2003) stars the hyper-kinetic and unpredictable Jack Black in a role specifically written for him by co-star Mike White.
Black plays Dewey Finn, a dedicated rocker who believes he and his band are on the verge of greatness, their main goal to win a locale battle of the Bands contest, get the prize money, recognition and, hopefully, a record contract.  Problem is Dewey tends to 'rock hard' on stage, which his band members feel is clownish and not fitting in with the image they want to project.  Thusly, Dewey soon finds himself voted out of the band and out of a means of income.  To top things off his meek roommate, Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and Ned's overbearing girlfriend, played by Sarah Silverman, decide Dewey must move out due to his inability to pay rent.  When it rains, it pours...
Anyway, while pondering thoughts of his situation, Dewey takes a phone call for Ned, who is a substitute teacher.  An exclusive preparatory school needs someone to fill in, and on discovering the decent amount of money involved, Dewey pretends he is Ned, and takes the job.  What was going to be some quick money soon turns out to be more as Dewey learns that the children are musically inclined, and gets the idea to try and build a band around the youngsters, and compete in the upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.  He passes the idea off on the children as a secret school project, and thus their education into 'hard rockin' begins.
Jack Black is the star of this movie, no doubt, with his spastic energy and erratic nature, but he certainly has a lot of help with his great supporting cast including Joan Cusack as the principal of the school (I am truly glad to see her back on the big screen as of late all I've been seeing her in is annoying wireless phone commercials) and all the talented children that comprise his class.  I was happy to see the filmmakers decided on going with a cast of relatively unknown children, rather than `cutesy', overused children we've seen in many other films.  And these children can truly perform, not only with acting, but also with their ability with their respective instruments.  The story is pretty classic one, a grown up somewhat forced into involvement with a group of children who soon finds he having an effect on his students, and, in turn, they are having an effect on him.  Personal growth develops all around, and we all get the warm fuzzies.  While some of other films of this nature tend to get a bit schmaltzy, The School of Rock seems to narrowly sidestep it, and avoids the tooth decaying sweetness so often involved in a stories like this one.
And let's not forget the music...Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Ramones, AC/DC, The Who and many more.  I was glad to hear so many great, classic songs accompany the movie, enhancing the complete hard rocking experience that is The School of Rock.
Special features are numerous, encompassing around four hours of material, but the best part for me was the inclusion of Jack Black's video pitch to legendary rock gods Led Zeppelin to use their Immigrant Song within the film.  Also included are separate commentaries by Black and the children, a video diary, trailers, interactive features, weblinks, a music video for the original song created for the finale, and more.
While the plot of the movie is pretty far-fetched and requires the viewer to suspend a great deal of belief, it worked for me and was a truly satisfying way to spend an hour and fifty minutes.  If you liked Black and his musical abilities, you might want to check out his band, Tenacious D.  The CD and DVD are both available here.  I definitely look forward to seeing him in future projects.

1978755,4,B00018U9FW,"Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a rock guitarist  who has recently been fired by his band. Desperate for cash, he poses as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. But Dewey doesn't know the first thing about teaching, so he's at a loss for anything academic to do. When he learns that many of his 5th-grade students are accomplished musicians, he decides to give these straight-laced kids a lesson in rock-n-roll. He turns the class into a rock band, complete with road crew, a security detail, and groupies. The whole class pitches in to get the band in shape to compete in the city's Battle of the Bands.

""School of Rock"" was directed by Richard Linklater and written by Mike White, who also plays Dewey's roommate Ned in the film. This movie is just a lot of fun. It was tailor-made for Jack Black, so it perfectly exploits his over-the-top sense of humor and physical comedy. ""School of Rock"" manages to pay tribute to rock-n-roll while making fun of its more histrionic and self-indulgent clich&eacute;s. It's all in good fun, though. Jack Black is funny and lovable as a reckless rocker who has unwittingly taken on considerable responsibility. Joan Cusack contributes one of her many memorable comedic performances as the uptight principal of the school, Miss Mullins. The child actors who play musicians were themselves chosen for their musical talent. Thankfully the film doesn't fake the kids playing the instruments. They are all accomplished musicians, and it's nice to see so much young talent on the screen. Young members of the audience will be encouraged to see that real kids can rock too. ""School of Rock"" is a lot of silly fun -but in a good way. It's a movie that both children and adults can enjoy. (By the way, in most parts of the world, this film got a G or PG rating.)

The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include a making-of documentary called ""Lessons Learned"", ""Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin"" is which he begs the band for permission to use the ""Immigrant Song"" in the movie, a music video for the film's theme song, ""Kid's Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival"", ""MTV's Diary of Jack Black"", a DVD-ROM (Windows only) that contains Dewey's History of Rock and an archive of the film's website, 2 audio commentaries, and a theatrical trailer. ""Lessons Learned"" is a decent documentary, and it features interviews with Jack Black, Mike White, Richard Linklater, and some of the kids. Jack Black fans will like ""MTV's Diary of Jack Black"", which spends one day in L.A. with the actor as he goes to rehearsals for the movie and works on new material for Tenacious D. One of the audio commentaries features Jack Black and Richard Linklater. It's entertaining, but there isn't much technical stuff if that 's what you're looking for. The other audio commentary features 7 of the child actors. It's chaotic, but it's interesting to hear the kids' point of view. One of the funniest things is that they've memorized all the punch lines from the movie. If you're interested in the kids, also check out the ""Kids Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival"", which follows the principal child actors for about 12 hours on the day of the film's screening at the Film Festival. Subtitles are available, for the film, in English. And dubbing is available in French.",1078876800,,3298,4.792618629173989
1978756,4,B00018U9FW,"I really had heightened expectations for ""School of Rock,"" because I tend to really like movies where people find an excuse to get up and play songs.  Besides, there was such good word of mouth on this film as well and I liked Jack Black's performance at the end of ""Shallow Hall.""  This time around Black plays Dewey Finn, who has been kicked out of the rock band he created because he tends to confuse his commitment to the power of rock 'n' roll with the gratification of his own ego.  He cons his way into a gig as a substitute teacher for a fifth-grade class at a private school and as soon as he finds out some of these kids can actually play instruments he start turning them into a rock band.  The goal is to go head-to-head with his old group and beat them into the ground at the upcoming Battle of the Bands.  He also gives his cherubs an education in rock, mainly because he is so appalled at their lack of knowledge.
Granted, there is a certain predictability to the plot here, but ""School of Rock"" does not fall into a similar trap with the characters.  Dewey does not get changed in the process as much as have his eyes opened to what is happening when you really collaborate in creating music and playing in a band.  In simpler terms, he starts practicing what he has been preaching.  As for the kids, they follow their rock 'n' roll Pied Piper's lead but they also are more than willing to stand up and get in Dewey's face.
I actually wanted more of a rock education for the viewing audience.  There is a nice little scene where Dewey has laid out a constellation chart of rock groups on the board, but instead of hearing him lecture we get the music on the soundtrack turned up loud.  Old viewers will of course recognize the names that Dewey drops throughout the film, but I kept thinking it would be nice if there were a few choice instances where Dewey drove home a couple of key points to the kidlets.  In other words, do with words what is done with music when Dewey teaches the kid who plays guitar the riffs for ""Sunshine Of Your Love,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""Smoke on the Water,"" or the keyboard player the opening of ""Touch Me.""
You can guess what is happening at the end, but that does not take away from the overall sense of fun, especially for younger viewers who will enjoy the fact the kids are all doing their own singing and playing.  I have just been comparing such musical grand finales to the end of ""Uptown Girls,"" and I find this one to be okay (the song was not up to the kids).  There are some efforts to take advantage of Joan Cusack playing the head of the school, but she really is underutilized (I was expecting more off of the Stevie Nicks reference).  These things just underscore not only that ""School of Rock"" could have been better but that we really would have liked this 2003 film to have made it all the way to the next level.",1078790400,5,2872,4.314126394052044
1978757,5,B00018U9FW,"What I mean by that is, it isn't completely homogenized. You're going to have to talk to the kids after the film to make sure they don't rebel against you.  Sure, it has plenty of good messages and humor mixed in there, but it doesn't hold down the subversive spirit of rock, which is envigorating.  Certainly the film is humorous and inspirational, but the plotline makes it sound like self-absorbed loafer dupes people into doing something that he couldn't have done himself and is forgiven. In other words, there's such a levity to serious subject matter like this that some people don't even realize how wrong Dewey's motives are. I have to give Jack Black and Richard Linklater credit because I don't think that anyone else could have pulled it off.  As for the DVD, it's excellent.  It captures the adult perspective of Black in the making of featurette, commentary, MTV's Diary of Jack Black. It also captures the kids who are broad draw for the film in the featurette, Toronto Film Festival Diary, commentary, and a portion of Jack Black's diary contains footage of them rehearsing songs for the soundtrack.  This DVD captures all the perspectives that you would like to see as a filmgoer who loves the film, like me.  Mike White, thank you for writing this for lovers of Black and Rock.  Extra points for acting in the movie as well, you were perfectly cast. That is all.",1078790400,,1380,4.7012448132780085
1978758,5,B00018U9FW,"This was a script written for Jack Black... comic zaniness mixed with loads of classic head banging rock and roll. No doubt the hidden basis for this movie was so that Black could play his own music. Writer Mike White (Ned Schneebly in this film) nailed Jack Black (Dewey Finn) to a tee. The story follows Dewey shreading on a guitar solo (just a tad long and over done), and being exiled from the band the very next day. His roommate (Ned) and annoying girlfriend (Patty - played perfectly by Sarah Silverman) get on his case about responsibilities and paying the rent. Dewey receives a phone call at home one day (meant for Ned)... the high priced private elementary school needs a substitute teacher. Dewey acts as Ned - and the fun and musical fusion begin. This movie is a ""toast to those who rock!"" The main kids in the band, Zack-Freddy-Lawrence-Katie, are all accomplished musicians in their own right and were picked to play their roles for just this reason. Not to mention Joan Cusack was a great pick as Priniple Mullins. Musical tributes to AC/DC and Led Zeppelin abound. If you're a Jack Black fan, as well as a classic rock fan - I guarantee you will truly enjoy this film. Extras on this DVD include often funny commentaries with Black as well as the kids; a short pitch to Led Zeppelin for permission to use a song in the movie, trailers and a music video. Ever since Black was able to let loose in John Cusack's ""High Fidelity""... I just look forward to everything he does.

His performance is phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it. He completely holds your attention, even when he's in the background and what makes him so extraordinary is that his performance is so damned fresh! Some of the ads described him as ""Gonzo"" comedian but he's much more than that. As the substitute teacher who teaches his bright kids about the history and the love of rock and roll, he conveys a genuine sweetness and tenderness that startles. I watched this movie twice, back-to-back, and will definitely buy it for my permanent DVD library. The down side is that aren't any roles out there for such a wondrous, free-spirited genius like Jack Black. God forbid they do the inevitable sequel. This movie worked on every level and although we know the outcome from the very beginning, it was fascinating to travel that path before The End appeared. The cast and the technical aspects are truly outstanding. But shining brilliantly in the center of it all is this fantastic performer named Jack Black.

The soundtrack is decent, especially if you are a Classic Rock lover like myself. Many references to AC/DC and some to other classic acts.

1978783,4,B00018U9FW,"An irresponsible hard Wrawker Dewey Finn, played by Jack Black, takes a temp job at a high achievement school as a teacher, and turns 10 year classical musicians into rockers.  Both the teacher, the students, the principal and the parents all learn something along the way.
The School of Rock is an entertaining film that walks the line between being family friendly and being offensive.  There were three moments during the film where one might wish the editor had cut the line for my younger children.  What will bother some are the mild references to sex and drugs.  But there is no cursing, nudity or simulated sex.  What may bother others is Dewey twins philosophies of Screw the Man and that Anger makes good Rock and Roll.  The kids adopt this philosophy, but Dewey takes responsibility for possibly the first time in his life.
But this is a comedy and the whole thing works.  After having sat through the movie, my kids immediately wanted to watch it a second time, and the 11 and 9 year old sat through it a second time.  My 7 year old went off to play.  So two thumbs up from pre-teens, two from mom and dad and two from my older sons!
What ever you think of Jack Black and his big mouth in real life, he is perfect in this movie.  He is a talented guy with an excellent rock singers voice.  This is a 3 star movie (good) but I'll give it an extra star because I am an old Wrawker myself.",1078704000,11,1398,4.338461538461538

1978785,4,B00018U9FW,"Screwball comedy is alive and well in ""The School of Rock"". It may be nonsensical, illogical and a bit puerile, but it also delightfully funny and ingeniously clever. Forget the ""PG-13"" rating. It is the best family comedy in a long time.
Dewey Finn [Jack Black] manages to get himself fired from the rock and roll group he founded. To add to his woes, his roommate, Ned [Mike White] a substitute school teacher, has a vicious new girlfriend who suggests that Dewey move if he can't come up with the rent. One day, Dewey answers a phone call for Ned from the principal [Joan Cusack] of an expensive private school. She needs a sub. The desperate Dewey goes to the school pretending to be Ned and is hired. Undaunted by his classroom full of ten-year olds, the resourceful Dewey decides to teach the history of rock and roll [the only subject he has any great knowledge of] and to get the students to form a rock band.
The plot is fragile and doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. The script itself, however, is witty, vibrant and full of great lines. Black gives his best [and most controlled] performance ever. His Dewey is a remarkable, eccentric, and lovable character. While there is no way such a person could successfully infiltrate a stuffy private school, one ends up wishing that he could.",1078617600,,1295,4.6347826086956525
1978786,4,B00018U9FW,"It is just absolutely amazing to see how suddenly Jack Black has emerged into the public eye despite a relatively lengthy career in films. It was his hysterical performance opposite Colin Hanks, Tom Hank's son, in Orange County that brought him fully into the mainstream spectrum but amazingly his feature film hasn't been confined to the comedy genre. Since his first appearance on screen in 1992, Black has appeared in such solemn features such as Waterworld, Dead Man Walking, and Enemy of the State. Hollywood soon became aware of the inspiring comedian when starred in the Farrelly Brothers comedy, Shallow Hal, and then the irreverent comedy, Saving Silverman. Now Jack Black's future is bigger and better then ever before with superior roles in three films in 2004: Envy, Shark Tale, and Anchorman. Not only that but Black's metal parody band, Tenacious D, has the potential to be another successful vehicle for the rising star, as his leading role in The School of Rock shows he has the enthusiasm and the look of a real rocker.
The story follows an out of work rocker who takes a substitute teacher position at a preppy grade school to get back at his former band members who dumped him from the band. Dewey Finn knows everything there is to know about the history of rock n' roll. He knows every band, every instrument, and every chord ... Rock n' roll is in his blood. The only thing he doesn't know is when to act mature. During a major band performance, Dewey goes off on a twenty guitar solo and acts in a way that not only embarrasses the band but himself as well. Dewey's fellow band members are fed up and, without any other choice, decide to vote him out of the band. With the pressure of his buddy's girlfriend to pay his share of the rent, the fledgling rocker impersonates a substitute teacher and takes a position at an uptight private school. Upon discovering the musical talents of the fourth graders he is placed to educate, Dewey decides to enter the group into a battle of the bands contest that pits the youngsters against his former band mates. Through his senseless antics and irreverent attitude, the children soon learn to break out of their shells and be who they want to be. The story for the School of Rock is decently played out but for the most part the plot is pretty predictable which takes away some of the emotional feelings you might have for the situation and/or the characters. In a film that preaches the message of breaking away from the conventional, School of Rock contradicts itself pretty easily.
The cast is pretty minuscule but that doesn't matter too much as the feature relies solely on the energetic performance of Jack Black, which is all that truly matters for this film. If you are not a fan of the work of Jack Black then you are going to have a hard time tolerating this film but even if you are non-partisan in the matter, you aren't exactly going to be rolling in the aisles laughing either. It's not that Black's performance isn't funny, it is, in parts, but for the most part his crazy antics come off as being more annoying then anything else. Joan Cusack is greatly under used in this film and it was rather disappointing to see the filmmakers not exploring the relationship more between her character and Black's.
Overall, The School of Rock reforms the school of thought on the conventional family film but not so much so that it will spark a new trend in Hollywood. It's not that the feature isn't entertaining, it is. The problem is that it is nothing more then that. The feeling this film leaves you with is hard to describe, so here's the best way one can put it: If you are at a buddy's house for a night with your best friends and the School of Rock is the film of choice, you won't exactly try to weasel everyone out of watching it but you wouldn't exactly be jumping for joy either. Despite a decent performance from Black, delightful performances from the children, and a rockin' song selection, the entire feature film, in the end, just feels flat. The message of the film also seems a bit lost as it preaches a break away from the conventional but at the same advocates children to fight against ""the man"" or authority, which is definitely a wrong message to send to the young children of America. There are enough problems out there with children disrespecting their parents, school administrators, etc. without this film sermonizing the message of deviance of authority. This may not be the exact way the filmmakers may have intended but it does come off that way. Bottom-line is that School of Rock will do as an entertaining diversion but nothing you essentially need to see before more worthy features like Lost in Translation or Matchstick Men.",1078617600,,4729,4.651135005973716

1978814,5,B00018U9FW,"This is without a doubt, Jack Black's finest hour, and makes you realize that in movies like the wonderful SHALLOW HAL and the marginally funny ORANGE COUNTY, we only got a taste of what Jack Black could pull off. This movie is different in many ways, for instance, it was written FOR him by someone who KNEW him personally, rather then just meeting him at an audition. And Jack Black is an extremely witty and funny man.
As Dewey Finn, Black is a hopeless struggling musician. After getting kicked out of his music group just before the big annual Battle Of The Bands contest, which was his only chance to pay his nerdy room mate who's a substitute teacher and his C-word of a girlfriend the rent which was long overdue, he took over his roomate's job as a substitute teacher when a middle school called up looking for a temp.
From here on, Jack Black plays a roll that's true to him in every way - the underdog. Black is one of those actors who everyone knows, yet you couldn't quite call him an A-list celebrity. Dewey Finn is known as a joke in the local rock scene and teaching his class of young impressive musicians how to play rock n roll is his only chance for fame and staying in his apartment. He gets so desperate and at times, hopeless that you're hoping he'll succeed.
The great thing about it is, as learned in the extras, that these kids did NOT just learn to play their instruments for the movie, as other reviewers have complained. (Lighten up, by the way, it's a movie not a damn album) In fact these kids weren't even ACTORS. They were musicians and they were hired for that fact alone which I think was a great way to approach it, since the musicianship from the kids were more essential then their acting abilities. If anyone can't understand that, you just missed the point. Jack Black DOES carry the movie because it is HIS movie. He's the main outlet for jokes, which some other reviewers complained about. But you gotta understand that that's the point. Dewey is placed in the middle of a very normal surrounding. Much more normal then most movies, where things are exaggerated considerably. Nothing is exaggerated here. It's as normal as you can get, so placing someone off the wall like Dewey in the middle of that, you rely on HIM for all of the comedy. And if he can carry such a wonderful movie, I think that says alot about him.
The ending is great, though I won't give it away, it teaches the point of the movie and what's most important. It drives the point home completely. Also, the band's performance during the closing credits is humorous as well. They finally found a way to keep you watching until the credits are done!
The extras are great. The Toronto film festival footage was a great addition. The MTV Diary feature might single handedly prove just how talented Jack is. It starts off with him late for an audition and him going through all his daily routines in just under a minute. And the greatest moment is him talking about his diet. He's not just a one trick pony, he can perform well without a script in front of him. All of the rest of the features are equally as good, especially the ""making of"" featurette.

I made the mistake of renting this for $4.00 on Tuesday night, loving it so much that I bought it at the store for $16.00 today.

1978816,5,B00018U9FW,"After being kicked out of his own band prior to the ""Battle of the Bands"", Dewey Finn's desperation reaches a fevered pitch; he has no money, no way to earn any, no way to compete with his old band and take home the prize money. His roommate's controlling girlfriend wants Dewey kicked out of the apartment. That all changes with a single phone call. Dewey pretends to be his roommate Mike (Mike White) and takes the job of substitute teacher at a private school. Dewey soon discovers that teaching is much harder than playing air guitar. The competitive kids appear restless and ill-at-ease doing nothing. Dewey has no luck recruiting for his new band. Until he discovers his class practicing classical music in the music room. An idea blooms full blown like a bad heavy metal song. The kids will be HIS backing band.
An inspired collision of indie sensibilities and Hollywood, the delightful ""School of Rock"" finally gives the talented performer Jack Black both a role he can sink his teeth into and one where he can demonstrate the chops he's honed as a member of Tenacious D. Black looks like a demonic Joe Cocker (prior to the beard of course) or Angus Young (AC/DC) after an eating binge. Black literally lights the movie up from within due to his infectious energy and humor. The screenplay by co-star Mike White (""The Good Girl"") was written specifically with Black in mind. Indie director Richard Linklater doesn't go the easy route; he makes Dewey into a likable slob who misleads, manipulates and twists everyone around so he can obtain his goal. Ultimately, Dewey is undone by his roommate's girlfriend otherwise he would have taken the charade all the way to the ""Battle of the Bands"".
Like ""The Commitments"" (the film this most closely resembles), ""School of Rock"" is at its best in the sequences where Dewey works with the class. Joan Cusack dives right into the heart of the uptight principal Rosalie Mullins and the scenes between her and Dewey are delightfully funny and charming. The best sequence between them involves Dewey asking her out for a drink so he can get her drunk. He's hoping to talk her into letting him take the kids out on a field trip (really the audition for the ""Battle of the Bands"") by getting her to sing along to Stevie Nick's ""Edge of Seventeen"". It's a crack up to see Cusack belt out the song in the biker bar that Dewey takes her to. The kids in the movie all give great performances. They appear natural and clearly are having a ball playing their roles as well as the instruments in the movie.
The extras on the disc are exceptional. They include Jack pleading with Led Zep to let the film use ""Immigrant Song""; the MTV Jack Black special as well as a very funny commentary by Black and director Linklater (plus a separate audio commentary track by the kids from the band). There's also a web site archive, the trailer, a video diary about the Toronto Film Festival and other great stuff.

I loved how Jack Black helps the kids in his class bring out their musical talents.  He makes a class of 5th graders feel good about themselves through music.  I was impressed by how talented the kids in the movie are especially the guitar player Zach.  Joan Cusack is perfectly cast as the strict principal. One of my favorite scenes is when she cuts loose and starts singing in the restaurant.  This movie has great music too.  I loved all songs performed by the band. I also liked  the classic rock songs by Led Zeppelin and Cream.  There is a very good music video at the end of the movie too.

I now have made my repentance for that to the Mighty Gods Of ROCK by renting this movie today on the day of the DVD release : March 2 2004 Tuesday..I just finished watching both the movie and the extras. To say this movie ROCKS is a severe UNDERSTATEMENT..In a day of too many pop divas and boy bands who can't even play an instrument..It is great to see this movie come out and kick them all in the ass..This is also one of the most FUN movies in a very long time. And one NOT to be missed..Jack Black is kinda like Chris Farley meets John Belushi..This is so funny..And these kids that is in this band with him are awesome to watch and listen to..One can only hope that they will keep the torch for ROCK and carry on in bands in the future..It would be a shame to see their talents go to waste..They all play their own instruments too..I along with my friends had started a rock band called ""DAWN PATROL"" when i was 13 going on 14 in 1980 and we are still playing together today..So this movie really hits home for me..And no matter what the powers that be say it is coz of that why we stayed off of drugs & drinking. In Jack Black's words ""ya gotta stick it to the man"" and so called today's rock has lost that incrediant that this movie resurrects and hopefully will transport over into the music world at warp speed. For that reason Jack Black may will be Rock's much needed Saviour. And if you are a ROCK fan i can guarantee it will for you as well..You are a ROCK fan you will love this movie and that is an understatement..
The extras on here ROCK as well..Mostly the music video and the ""lesson.."" behind the scenes..There is also a ""Kommentary"" done by the school of Rock kids..All the Kids here deliver great performances all around..The character of them named ""Summer"" played by Miranda Cosgrove is a little scenestealer..Watch this girl she is going to go places she is priceless and sooooo cute..And i have to mention too that another one ""Katie"" played by Rebecca Brown looks so much like Jessica ""Dark Angel"" Alba when Alba was that age and also lot like Vega of Spy Kids Fame..So ROCK fans unite and enjoy this truly one of a kind movie..Not enough space here to tell of all its greatness. Parents that have grown up with the REAL ROCK do what this movie does and teach your children the education of the SCHOOL OF ROCK. *********Long Live Rock And RoLL!!!!!!***********",1078185600,5,2480,4.3585313174946005
1978822,5,B00018U9FW,"They say that the two things you should never work with on a movie are animals and children. They are notoriously difficult to deal with and invariably end up stealing every scene. Jack Black, star of raunchy comedies, like Orange County, is not the first person you'd think of to headline a kid's film backed by a Hollywood studio. It's even stranger that said film is directed by Richard Linklater, known primarily for making acclaimed independent films like Slacker. Added into the mix is a script written by Mike White, who is responsible for provocative films, like The Good Girl. And yet all of these diverse elements combine to produce School of Rock, one of the funniest and most entertaining comedies to come out of a major studio in a long time.
On the DVD, Jack Black and Richard Linklater contribute a spirited and informative commentary track. This is a really funny commentary track as Linklater and Black play well off each other, talking and joking in a relaxed manner. This is most definitely a must-listen for fans of both men as it is the first time either one has done a commentary.
There is a commentary track by the kids in the band. It comes across as a little chaotic because of the number of participants but they all seem to be having a blast watching the film together and talking about their experiences working with Jack Black on a big time Hollywood movie.
""MTV's Diary of Jack Black"" is a promotional bit that follows Black around for a typically frenetic day as he gets ready to make the movie. Fortunately, he knows it's all promotional BS and hams it up appropriately.
""Lessons Learned in School of Rock"" is a making of featurette. There is some sweet footage of Jack Black and the kids recording music for the movie at Sonic Youth's studio with Jim O'Rourke. The movie gets instant cool points for having musicians like O'Rourke and the Von Bodies on board to help out.
One of the best extras on the disc is ""Jack Black's Pitch to Led Zeppelin."" Black wanted to have ""The Immigrant Song"" in the movie but Led Zep has a reputation of rarely allowing their music to be used. So, Linklater suggested Black film an open plea to the band, asking them permission to use the song.
Also included is a music video for the title song from the movie and ""Kids' Video Diary: Toronto Film Festival"" that follows the kids from the movie around for the day as School of Rock debuts at the prestigious Toronto International Film Festival.
While School of Rock deviates little from The Bad News Bears formula-you'll see the ending coming a mile away-it is really a fun and entertaining ride.

this movie has a ton of heart!  it is a feel-good journey into the mind of jack black.  you can see his love of rock in this movie as he acts to the best of his strengths.  he is on top of his game in this movie and it is worth seeing for that alone.
another sell in this movie is the kids they got for the roles.  instead of going after actors, they went after actual musicians.  being a guitar player myself, i HATE to see fake-guitar playing by someone who obviously has no idea what they are doing.  rather, the kids are skilled and do an incredible job of playing in a rock band.

I'm sure you've heard of this movie by now, as it has been raved about by critics and movie-goers alike. Jack Black gives one of his best performances yet (only rivaled by his position as a stoner brother in Orange County and as a wise ass vinyl CD shop worker in High Fidelity) and boosts every scene that much more. All the kids in this movie actually play each instrument, which is pretty amazing considering their age.
Black plays a washed-up rocker who just got kicked out of his band for the ""outdated"" 15-minute solos and stage dives. He needs to get in a new band but he also needs a job to pay for his rent of living with a friend (Mike White) and his whiny girlfriend in an apartment. His girlfriend finally convinces White to make Black start paying the rent, so Black getsthe idea to pretend to be White's character when called upon to sub in one of the nation's top schools. As long as his friend doesn't know, it will give me a place to stay until I get in a band, Black figures. So he basically lets the kids have recess all day while he sleeps, until he hears them in music class and gets the idea to make a band out of them and compete in the Battle of the Bands against many others, including his previous band that kicked him out.
Despite how amazingly far-fetched and ridicoulus the plot is, if you can realize that it's just a movie, you will definetly enjoy yourself. Great writing, acting, everything.

1978883,5,B00018U9FW,"A ""feel good movie""? You bet your bippie. Funny as all heck? Yup ! Can Jack Black make adults and kids laugh without crossing any taboo lines? Absolutely. Black this time refrains from any real lewd crude humor due to the fact this is a PG-13/Disney production. However, those of us that know his humor as adults can see at times where the ""dark side"" wants to come out. It is his high doses of sarcastic and comedic comebacks and supercharged physical antics that keeps the energy level of this movie on high so the audience doesn't fall asleep. He is a true entertainer. At times, with his physical machinations, almost channels in the spirit of the late Chris Farley...All this said, the plot or storyline is simple...
Black plays a down and out founder of a rock band whose remaining members have given him the boot due to ""artistic differences"". Soon, he assumes the identity of his roommate who is a substitute teacher. He does it for the love of teaching? To better educate today's youths? Not. He does it for the money to avoid being evicted by his roommate for not paying rent on time. In the process, he must scam and convince the principal played by Joan Cusack that he is the real thing. He realizes that his students are prodigal musicians. A band is born and you must see the rest of the movie. Many will say that Black's character is exploiting the gifted younglings and living vicariously through them for what he could not accomplish with his real band. In a way, yeah, he is. But you decide...",1071532800,2,1511,4.538461538461538
1978884,3,B00018U9FW,"Upon hearing that Jack Black is going to be your new teacher, one reaction might be to run for the hills.  A second, more reasonable reaction (given Mr. Black's recent catapult to fame and ""hipster status"") would be: ""This ought to be _____ (interesting, cool, fun, spunky, wild...choose an adjective.)""  All of those descriptions work to explain Jack Black's teaching style in the aptly titled School of Rock, in which Black turns a class of bewildered seventh graders into a full-fledged rock `n roll band.

Jack Black plays Dewey Finn, an unemployed guitarist in a rock band going nowhere.  He lives in a rented room with henpecked substitute teacher Ned Shneebly and Ned's domineering girlfriend who is as welcoming of Dewey as Norman Bates is of passing travelers.  This is because Dewey hasn't paid his rent in ages, and he needs to come up with a heap of cash or he'll get the boot from the apartment.  It doesn't help that he's just been voted out of his band because they've decided he ""sucks too much"" to play with them at the upcoming Battle of the Bands.  But when Dewey picks up a phone call from Horace Green Prep School asking if Ned is available to substitute teach for a few weeks, Dewey senses his chance to make some quick money. He pretends he's Ned and agrees to teach the class, despite his obvious lack of know-how. As expected, he's a complete failure as a teacher, but he gets an idea when he witnesses their talents in music class.  Dewey plans to turn the group of youngsters into a rock band and take them to play at the Battle of the Bands in order to win prize money, all while avoiding the comically stringent school principal who is completely oblivious to his ""project.""

If nothing else, it's a great idea.  Sure, we've seen the general framework before (""Hard-core dude meets his biggest challenge: children!"") in movies like Kindergarten Cop and Daddy Day Care, but School of Rock is one of the better movies of this fray.  Why?  Because out of this formula stems a concept that is original and worthwhile. It's also one to which many of us can relate-we've all had teachers we thought were boring, and perhaps we wished someone like Jack Black would step in and teach us instead.  That's really what makes the kids' transformations so fun to watch: Dewey loosens them up and actually gets them to realize the range of their musical abilities (there is a constructive element to Dewey's teaching after all.)

Nobody could have played Dewey as effectively as Jack Black.  Nobody.  Dewey has his head in the clouds (he thinks he's a better guitarist than he actually is,) his legs on the ground (he's as cool as your uncle,) one foot firmly planted in the `70s rock `n roll era and the other foot in a beer can.  He's a classics-loving party animal with big dreams, and it's the perfect vehicle for Jack Black to bring his delightfully hammy Tenacious-D antics to the big screen.  Unbelievably, though, Jack Black doesn't entirely steal the show, which is a feat considering he's the only headliner (pun intended) in the movie.  The schoolchildren play their parts with similar zeal.  They may be caricatures, but that doesn't mean they aren't worthy characters-in fact, the more one-dimensional schoolchildren are in films, the more lovable they are.  This is because a class of children is really a collective, so their outstanding traits combine to make a multi-dimensional group.  In School of Rock, they're all here: the unhip nerd, the aloof valedictorian, the rebellious troublemaker, the cool guitarist stifled by his parents, and so on.  They're predictable, but that works to their advantage-they become ""tools"" for Dewey to work his magic.

Unfortunately, the film still has some flaws.  Last I checked, School of Rock is a comedy, but the writers apparently forgot to include a crucial comedic element: jokes.  There are few sprinkled in there (and quite funny, too,) but when I got right down to it, I was forced to realize that the humor survived off of Jack Black's charismatic line delivery alone.  I mentioned earlier that School of Rock sports a great idea, but having said that, the film is a bit better in theory than it is in practice: it's really a one-trick pony from start to finish.  Add to that a two-hour running time (on the lengthy side for a comedy,) and the film begins to lose steam as it approaches the end.  Finally, for all of Jack Black's comic greatness, the writers don't give him a whole lot to work with.  Far too many times does he divulge his almost fanatical devotion to rock `n roll, and while that may play well on a 40-minute Tenacious-D CD, this kind of unvaried writing tends to become grating in a two-hour feature film.  He's even forced to repeat a line of dialogue (""But that's a very important job!"")-a telltale sign of screenwriters asleep at the wheel.

Even still, all the ranting and raving in the world can't disprove that School of Rock is an enjoyable movie purely on the surface-that is to say, picking it apart is more fruitless than just sitting back with popcorn and soaking it in.  You'd also be hard-pressed to find a more original comedy this year (especially considering the recent wasteland of sophomoric gross-out comedies hitting our theaters like spitballs,) and by virtue of that alone, it shouldn't be overlooked.",1071187200,2,5321,4.748913043478261

It has fun with the history of rock, its cliches, and even race, privilege and mone all at the same time.  Black plays a down on his luck rocker named Dewey, who poses as his best friend to be a substitute teacher at a posh private school, filled with kids who know more about Handel than Hendrix.  Dewey changes all of that by making his class believe that there is a state-wide project that involves all schools to form a rock band and battle it out.
And the kids Dewey meets along the way all turn out to be gifted musicians, as well as fodder for some of the funniest comedy to come along this year.  His band is made up of an Asian (on piano), African-Americans (back-up singers), and stiff white guys (on guitar and drums).  But the ""School of Rock"" has a sweetness and a genuine nature about it that transends race and heritage, not to mention the kids in the movie are immensely talented.  The child actors (those who had to) learned to play their instruments, and they do a damn good job too.  Black once said in an interview that he was kind of embarrased to be surrounded with kids who were better musicians than he was.  But Black really shines in sequences where director Richard Linklater lets Black cut loose, trashing MTV, poking fun at Einsteins Theory of Relativity and letting ad lib the a scene that coincides with the closing credits.

Then he thoought that maybe he could get the kids to play in the ""Battle of the Bands""with him, so he gets all the gear into the room and gives them all certain parts, like guitar(electric), Bass, keyboards,backup singers, and also puts people as lookout to make sure that no one finds out. But one thing that the kids think is that the band is a class project that they were going to do in the next simester. and so they go on to the battle of the bands and the crowd loves them, but the end could be very suprising. Me, pesanally will buy this whenit comes out on DVD. I think that everyone that watches it will enjoy it's original jokes very much!",1069459200,,1418,4.13768115942029
1978938,4,B00018U9FW,"""School Of Rock"" is nothing less than the feel-good movie of the year.  It's fitting that the movie is filled with blatant AC/DC worship, because it's very much like one of that band's albums: it's excessive and often lowbrow, but you can't help but enjoy it because it's so full of energy and enthusiasm.  And most importantly of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Whether intentionally or not, director Richard Linklater and co. deal a major backhanded slap to all the sissified nu-metal and post-grunge ""sensitive guy"" bands currently dominating the airwaves, reminding us all that rock music is supposed to be fun and ultimately uplifting.
First of all, if ""School Of Rock"" doesn't make Jack Black a star, nothing will.  Black gives one of the most lovably over-the-top performances in history as Dewey Finn, an aspiring metal musician who poses as his friend Ned in order to get a substitute teaching job at a posh elementary school.  From the opening scene at a rock club, where Dewey launches into a frenzied guitar solo, whips off his shirt, and attempts a stage dive into an apathetic crowd, Black is a whirlwind of manic energy.  Much like Jim Carrey, Black doesn't just play the demented role: he means it, and the authenticity he brings to the movie makes all the diference.  Quick, think of another guy who could pull off the role this well.  This is Black's show, and he knows it.
When Dewey takes a position teaching the uptight children of uptight parents, the stage is set for a classic fish-out-of-water comedy.  Many of the movies' funniest moments come early on, when the overweight, disheveled Dewey and his privileged students can't quite figure out what to make of each other.  The plot?  Realizing that some of his students have musical talent, Dewey, under the guise of a school project, gets them to start up a rock outfit to compete at the local battle of the bands.  Along with the way he teaches them plenty about the history of rock and its value for, among other things, ""fighting the man.""  Naturally, the kids, their parents, and the school's principal (played by Joan Cusack, who would steal the movie if Black didn't), all learn valuable lessons about taking chances and enjoying life.
This plot may sound rather hackneyed, but ""School Of Rock"" doesn't succeed by avoiding cliches; it succeeds my embracing them with all the vigor and passion of Dewey playing a guitar solo.  The movie's overbearing earnestness, which I typically find to be more of a turnoff than a woman with bigger muscles than me, turns out to be its greatest asset.  The reason?  Because ""School Of Rock"" conveys the too-often-forgotten lesson that people need to lighten up, and rock music has long been a valuable device for doing just that.  At its heart, the film's message is simple but enormously effective: that Rock 'n' Roll really just might be able to change the world.
It all comes to a head in the film's monster conclusion, with Dewey donning an Angus Young-styled schoolboy uniform for the Battle of the Bands.  Black absolutely owns the stage in this scene; there's no way the image of him performing won't be indelibly etched in the minds of all who see it.  If you know your stuff, you can also see the nods to Yes and The Clash in the kids' attire.  The song the band performs, fittingly titled ""School Of Rock,"" is a lot like the movie itself: it's filled with rock cliches, but its youthful rebellion and energy more than make up for it.  It certainly beats much of what's on the radio today, just as the movie beats much of what's in your local multiplex.  Sometimes good intentions and inspired acting can carry a film, and ""School of Rock"" is one such example.",1068854400,69,3699,4.728971962616822
1978939,5,B00018U9FW,"This movie is awe-inspiring for its refusal to give into certain misconceptions of what rock and roll is supposed to be. Instead it gives us the classical views of rock.  As a means to derail the man it is a very political venting tool that only the most dedicated can follow.  Just because the most popular rock stars are egotistical sex symbols, play boring music, and make a spectacle of themselves championing recreational drug use and/or public drunkeness, that doesn't mean that's the way it should be, it's just the way it is.  School of Rock eschews all of these things as traps of money and fame, its main concern is to show the world rock at its purest form and what better audience to teach than children?  Dewey Finn, the main character, is almost childish in his pure belief of the power of rock.  It is because of this that the movie works.  Hearing kids saying things about the meaning of rock is to get loaded is kinda shocking, but not unbelievable considering what popular artists allow the public to see nowadays and the things that the conservative majority have always said about the musical style.  The only things that should worry parents about this movie is that it works to undermine authority on some base plotline levels because that's what rock has done historically against 'the man.'  In the movie, this 'man' is parents and school authority.  This is not the best thing to encourage, but 'school of rock' shouldn't be treated as direct reality, to a certain extent it's a fantasy. I enjoyed that fantasy very much because it's something that should be more known.",1068768000,2,1595,4.7086330935251794

Finally somebody actualy thinks when making a movie, instead of coping a book.  It's like the reality game shows, it never ends.  When i saw this movie on November 10th, it was a laugh-out loud (especialy for the kid sitting next to me) comedy.  Jack Black was the ultimate part to play Dewy.

1978972,5,B00018U9FW,"THE SCHOOL OF ROCK reconfirms that Richard Linklater and Mike White are two of the finest talents in the movies today, and proves that given the right vehicle Jack Black can be a superb and exciting performer.  Black is not your everyday actor:  he is chubby and isn't especially attractive, and possesses an energy and outrageousness that are not at home in very many motion pictures.  He has made a number of decent films, but he hasn't really had many that truly meshed with his unique talent, but THE SCHOOL OF ROCK is absolutely perfect for him.  His wackiness, his manic vigor, his musicality, and his talent for physical comedy are so right for his role in this film that the part was clearly written with him in mind.
Richard Linklater has quietly put together an impressive string of films since he came out with the ultra-indie flick SLACKERS in 1991.  He followed that film up with one of the great high school films ever, DAZED AND CONFUSED, and went on to direct BEFORE SUNRISE and the amazing WAKING LIFE, along with a couple of lesser films.  I wouldn't say that this is his best film, but it is his funniest and the most entertaining.
Similarly, Mike White, who also plays Jack Black's roommate Ned Schneebly, has turned out a string of first-rate scripts, and has established himself as one of the better writers on the boundary between independent and mainstream film.  I first became aware of him following his very odd (but surprisingly upbeat) indie film  CHUCK AND BUCK, which he followed with two strong scripts for ORANGE COUNTY and THE GOOD GIRL, appearing in both of them, most memorably in the latter, where he played Jennifer Aniston's fundamentalist Christian coworker.
The results of putting Black, White, and Linklater together could be expected:  a very good film.  But the surprising and impossible to anticipate aspect of the film is the superb group of pre-teens recruited to play the students in the class Jack Black teaches ro rock and roll.  Instead of targeting actors, the makers of the film went after kids with musical backgrounds, and while it isn't surprising that they do quite well playing their instruments and singing, it is amazing how well they do as actors.  They don't merely do well, they and Black together form a great team, both musically and otherwise.
I have to add that I did have a little trouble with all the bands they reference.  At one point they play ""Roadrunner"" by the Modern Lovers, but the brute fact is that knowing and loving that album (which I do) precludes loving or even knowing much about AC/DC.  They are oil and water; they do not blend.  I have very wide-ranging musical tastes, but they reference way, way too many bands.  Musical taste tends to run in definite directions.  Megadeth fans don't listen to Television, and Television fans don't listen to Megadeth, and neither listens to Yes while both might listen to Led Zeppelin.  There was just an odd blending of very cool bands like the Modern Lovers and the Velvet Underground, and what most sophisticated rock fans consider to be uncool, like AC/DC and Yes.  But I think they were striving for an all inclusiveness, which they largely achieved.
Regardless of one's musical taste, I strongly recommend this movie.  Jack Black will keep all but the most uptight in stitches, and the story of how a bunch of kids become rockers will keep almost anyone entertained.",1067817600,,3397,4.784246575342466
1978973,4,B00018U9FW,"This was a phenomenal mainstream movie that's funny and VERY family-friendly:  there is humor for both adults and children, and some GREAT classic rock songs and references will get the adults' toes tapping while children watch actors their age rock out on screen.  ""The School of Rock"" was directed by Richard Linklater (""Waking Life"", ""Dazed  and Confused"", ""Slacker"") and written by Mike White (who plays Jack Black's roommate in this film).
Jack Black really shines in any role that is music-related (see also: his stellar performance in ""High Fidelity"" and the work of his own band Tenacious D).  But even beyond the main role, there is some tremendous acting here, both the adults (the aforementioned Mike White, and also Joan Cusack is great as an uptight elementary school principal) and the children.  There are a few moments in the film that aren't well-explained, but overall, this is a great family feel-good movie.",1067299200,2,927,5.072368421052632
1978974,5,B00018U9FW,"Normally, I don't like Jack Black too much, but this movie was great. At first, I was a little skeptical but the more I learned of it, the more hopeful I became. When I went to see it, I wasn't disappointed.
One thing in particular I liked about this movie was the message. Rock'n'roll is about freedom, individuality, and the ability to express yourself the way you want to through music.
Modern rock, for the most part, is just a lot of guys whining about how miserable their lives supposedly are, despite the fact that they have millions of fans, can buy and sell said fans, and are highly successful.
Classic rock is more to my liking. Some of it was just having fun with music and enjoying life, some of it had deeper meanings. You couldn't go wrong either way. This movie has an excellent soundtrack and features the music and names of great bands and musicians from the past (many of whom are still recording and performing in the present) like Yes, Pink Floyd, Rush, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC and Blondie.
 It's a great film for parents to have their kids watch. It promotes individuality and determination, it encourages children to be themselves and remain secure in their identities.
It may be a little farfetched for a bunch of kids in the same classroom to all have such incredible talents and learn in such a short time, and some people may find the messages a little old, but I really enjoyed this movie. I know a lot of ""Be yourself"" movies tend to have a theme going wear ugly people get a makeover and find acceptance. In this movie, the only transformation the characters go through is their massive boost of confidence. None of them got makeovers, they just cutlivated a personal style that they liked. And real world examples were given to support this.
All in all, I thought this was a great family movie that has a great message with nothing superficial to it. I highly recommend it.",1067126400,,1923,4.573913043478261

However, this movie, while it is in the same genre, ends up being different, inventive, and exciting to watch.  I think the difference is Jack Black, who gives what is probably the performance of his career.  Black is wonderful in this role and makes the whole movie worth while.  Cudos also to Joan Cusak as an uptight principal and some incredibly talanted kids who, as I understand, actually perform all the music.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved this movie.

1978978,4,B00018U9FW,"Despite some of the various plot holes and implausibilities, this is Jack Black's shining moment (as well as other child actors) and crowning achievement. I enjoyed this film partly because Jack Black and the makers of the film seem to have an obvious appreciation for classic rock/hard rock/metal that was missing from recent Hollywood failures like Rock Star. References abound to Yes, Rush, Led Zeppelin, even Iron Maiden abound in this movie. Jack Black is hilarious as a burned out early 30 something rocker turned substitute teacher, and his usual mannerisms and inflections are used to humorous effect.
The film is inspiring, funny, even a bit ""cute"" in a family film sort of way. However these more ""cutesy"" themes are transcended with the wit of the dialogue and some of the more adult situations in  the film. It isn't EXACTLY a kid's movie, but could be seen with probably younger preteens, in my eyes it appeals to adults more.

Plan on taking the kiddies along for this one.  Apart from the whole 'stick it to the man' thing -- a philosophy that kids should probably eschew, at least until they are a couple of semesters into college -- there is little very objectionable here (though a little 'Parental Guidance'-type discussion in the car afterward is never a bad thing.

There was the passion, the hard work, the doubters, the inspiration to others, the self-doubt, the make-it-or-break-it performance, the agonizing defeat, the honor... all of which are elements that weave out a musician's colorful life. I certainly can relate to a large part of it from my own experience participating in music competitions/productions.

1978998,5,B00018U9FW,"Jack Black is the star of the hit movie, ""School of Rock"".  He plays an unemployed rock musician named Dewey Finn who is abruptly dumped by his band before a big performance.  Dewey  has an encyclopedic knowledge of rock music, which is his life's passion.  Unfortunately, he has no income, and he is on the verge of being tossed out on the street by his long-suffering friend, Ned, for not paying his rent.  Desperate for a buck, Dewey poses as Ned to get a substitute-teaching gig in a fancy prep school.
Sounds logical, right?  Try this on for size. Dewey knows nothing about teaching, so he organizes his tightly wound and upwardly mobile students into a rock band.  The versatile Joan Cusack plays the buttoned-down and intense principal, Rosalie Mullins, who is oblivious to the raucous sounds emanating from Dewey's classroom.
Why does ""School of Rock"" work, considering that it is so preposterous?  First of all, the director, Richard Linklater, tailored the movie around the special talents of the manic Jack Black.  Black's uninhibited acting style is perfect for this role and his unbridled enthusiasm helps the audience to go with the flow.  Not for one second did I believe that any of the goings-on in this movie could happen in our galaxy, but I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt.  The physical comedy is marvelous.  The children who play Dewey's students are appealing.  There are even several touching scenes, especially one in which Dewey encourages a heavy-set student to accept herself the way she is and to be proud of her considerable talent.
""School of Rock"" has plenty of conventional elements, but the far from conventional Jack Black is an absolute hoot.  Put your brain on hold and be prepared for a rocking good time when you  see the entertaining and lively ""School of Rock"".",1065657600,5,1807,4.840390879478828
1978999,4,B00018U9FW,"Most Jack Black movies would have me running in the opposite direction but, because of the talents of the director (Richard Linklater...""Slacker"") and the screenwriter (Mike White...""Chuck and Buck""), I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.
""School of Rock"" is set in a private grammar school and deals with some important growing us issues: how the general population of school or in life really tends to marginalize those that are different and how parents sometimes disregard the talents and wishes of their children in the quest to get them into a first class college. Mind you that the children in Dewey's (Jack Black) class are approx 10-11 years old!
Dewey arrives on the scene masquerading as a substitute teacher and he thinks that he will be able to just chill and collect a paycheck so that he can pay his rent. What he doesn't bargain for is that he will grow to like his charges and, because of his outsider status and drive to be a rock star, encourages their artistic and more importantly musical talents.
Linklater's films are always full of wit and irony and never sentimental at all so it is no wonder that all of these attributes are intact in his direction of this film; which is a godsend because this stuff could have easily degraded into bathos.
Jack Black is obnoxious, rude and crude but here Linklater and White have anointed him with an understanding and compassion for these children: he's Uncle Buck and Ozzy Osbourne all rolled into one.
""School of Rock"" is fun, beautifully directed and written and on top of all of this has a lesson for us all: give your kids some space to be themselves.

1979000,3,B00018U9FW,"As long as you're okay with a bunch of 10-year-olds joining hands and praying to the God of Rock (with a pretty Church of Satan-like prayer, to boot), then this movie is light and fun family fare. (Hey, at least they're praying, right?)
What works about this movie is Jack Black.  There is something demented about him that fits his lead role perfectly.  You get the sense that he's whacked in real life, and while he might not try to turn prep schoolers into rock stars, he just weird enough to make it possible.  But he is also part of what is wrong with the movie (a small part, but still ...).  There are moments where he just makes you want to cringe from all his weirdness, like when he sings a song he wrote to the class.  It goes on way too long and is, well, creepy.  Not good weird, but sad weird.  Because like his character in High Fidelity (a much better performance, I think, in a much better movie), Jack comes across like a guy who is, deep down, a sad, alienated loser; a guy who sits in a subway doing word search puzzles--maybe homeless, certainly dateless, and maybe a bit cranky.  And smart.
As for the rest of the film, the child actors are okay.  Nothing to write home about, but at least they're not cringeworthy.  The rest of the cast basically mails it in, but that's okay since Jack is a one man army.  So raise your goblet of rock and see this thing; you'll be mildly amused.

But the trailers intrigued me and the reception at the Toronto Film Festival along with an ""A"" grading from ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY made me curious enough to go and see it. The only time I've seen Jack Black previously was in SHALLOW HAL and I anticipated that he was going to be the same type of character and kind of a jerk, that the movie would be filled with sight gags and corny jokes.  Not so.
The humor in this movie comes from the illogical and highly improbable premise of a down-on-his-luck rock musician faking it as a substitute teacher at a prestigious private school.  Learning that these kids are learning to play classical music, he gets the idea of teaching them the principles of rock music, and the movie goes from there.  The rock musician is definitely an intelligent individual, not a stumblebum or jerk.  Actually, he is one who lives for rock music, who has almost a religious fervor for the music and for performing it.  And Jack Black is surprisingly good in portraying this.
Bottom line:  I liked it.  It's an unpretentious and fun type comedy that I honestly recommend.",1065571200,10,1136,4.645

Dewey owes two grand to him in rent money, insisting that the band will win cash in the 'Battle of the Bands'. However, during practise, Dewey is fired from his band for his 20-minute solos and stage-hogging. Dewey then accepts Ned's substituting job at Horace Green, a prestigious prep school, desperate for money. When he overhears the kids in music class, he realizes their talent and attempts to create a band with them.
My parents and I enjoyed the movie: any rocker would. With a fantastic classic rock soundtrack including Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Ramones, and even two original songs, it covers all genres of music and will definetly squeeze some laughs out of you. Jack Black's appealing role and fun classes (rock appreciation, rock history, and band practice) take apart rock music, instrument by instrument, band by band, to keep you interested. I'm definetly getting this on DVD. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good time!",1065484800,,1152,5.1005291005291005
1979024,5,B00018U9FW,"After seeing the previews of ""School of Rock"", I highly anticipated seeing it in the theaters. It is the best movie I have seen in the theaters this year and I highly recommend it all fans of Black, Rock, and smiling to head straight to the closest theater playing this fantastic, awesome, and all around wildly entertaining hour and 45 minutes.
Black is hysterically funny. My sides were splitting from laughing so much at his goofy rocker character, Dewey Finn. Especially his eyebrows.
Dewey has just been kicked out of  his band and decides to start his own band.  The Horace Finn school calls looking for Ned Scheebly (played by the screenwriter of the movie, Mike White) a substitute teacher, Dewey answers the phone. He desperately needs cash to pay his rent so he pretends to be Ned. Now, at this juncture in many comedies, this is where the film should lose much of it's audience. However, Jack Black's antics and wildly goofy behavior keep you.
His students are all in 5th grade, and when he finds out some of them play instruments, his mind and eyebrows concoct a brilliant scheme.  His old band is entering a battle of the bands so he decides to create his own pre-teen band and enter the contest as well.  The guitarist kid is amazing!!!  All the children did a great job, and seemed to be having a blast with Black.  He's just a big kid himself after all.
Eventually, he is found out thanks to Ned's annoying and controlling girlfriend played by Sara Silverman. I remember her from ""greg the bunny"", a very short lived sitcom.  We have a film with an uplifting happy ending that sends you home with a smile on your face as you go searching through your c.d. collection for some AC/DC.
Also, I thought Joan Cusack was quite comical as the uptight school Prinicpal. Black works well with both Cusacks(John is High Fidelity)
And thanks to Mike White for confirming to me that you aren't a total nutcase screenwriter(also wrote Chuck & Buck and The good girl). You've restored my faith in your work after this charming rocknroll comedy.",1065484800,3,2046,4.650969529085873
1979025,5,B00018U9FW,"This is one great movie.  I have never been a fan of Jack Black, but things may change because of this gem of a movie.  It does not deserve it's pg-13 rating, it is a great movie that kids and adults will enjoy.  The kids are adorable and Jack is a master in the School of Rock.  If you are a teacher, had a teacher, were a kid you need to see this movie.  The music is great the performances top notch.  WOW!!!!!!!!!",1065398400,,417,3.963855421686747
1979026,5,B00018U9FW,"I wasn't planning to see this movie although Jack Black is funny.  I didn't know if my kids wanted to see it but was unsure if it would be proper for them.  I then read Roger Eberts review and decided to give it a shot since the kids wanted to see it.
Good Move
This movie works on every level.  The music is excellent, the comedy is well timed and well delivered, the kids are, well, kids. (and that makes half the movie right there)
This movie will have such cross appeal that it will do a killer box office and it deserves it.  I just hope that we don't see a sequel, however given the response of the crowd and the quality of the picture it is inevitable.
Watch it AND buy it.",1065398400,,680,4.052238805970149
1979027,5,B00018U9FW,"I was suprised at how much I enjoyed this movie! Jack Black's insane and all-out hilarious ways to entertain reminds me alot of how Chris Farley used to act. I was such a big Farley fan. Actually, I still am. Now, after watching School of Rock, I'm a Jack Black fan, too!
A down-on-his-luck former rocker (Mr. Black) desperately needs money. Gets a call from a prep school, saying they're in great need of a subsitute. Dewey takes the name of his friend, Ned (who is a sub) and he's off to teach...a fifth grade class. But he doesn't want to teach at all. He'd rather rock...and bring the kids into it, too!
School of Rock is totally original, hilarious, and entertaining. I'd love to see it again!",1065398400,,698,4.4609375
1979028,5,B00018U9FW,"I love when a formula movie actually makes an attempt to be clever. With ""School of Rock,"" director Richard Linklater and writer Mike White have taken the ""inspirational teacher"" movie and turned it on its head, thank God.
This movie is hilarious, offbeat, filled with interesting characters and a cool, consistent message that sometimes you learn more by ""sticking it to The Man.""
Jack Black, the film's star, deserves much of the credit for the film's success. He's fall-on-the-floor funny and, as a true musician, he's able to convey his character's passion for rock 'n' roll with tremendous intensity. The advice you see him giving the fifth-graders in his charge is actually useful and avoids annoying cliches.
Another plus is that the movie knows its rock music, recommending Yes, Rush and Led Zeppelin over modern pop.
And the film's finale is awesome, complete with an ending that once again goes against movie tradition.
I highly recommend this.",1065398400,,954,5.082802547770701
1979029,5,B00018U9FW,My husband and I saw this movie and we loved it.  It brought back memories of the rock we used to listen to.  Jack Black was awesome (and creepy at the same time!).  There were also some lessons learned.  This was a great movie to sit back and enjoy.  We laughed so hard because we could relate to some of the references.  It would be a great family movie for kids 13 and up.,1065398400,,375,4.0
1979030,5,B00018U9FW,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  If you think this is a kid's movie, get with it, I'm 57.  Jack should win the Academy Award for this performance.  You keep expecting the movie to get dull or drop into another 'fart' sequence, but it never happens.  Strong from start to finish.  Kids are great- they don't overact-they defer to the master-Jack.  Don't miss this one.",1065312000,,384,4.414285714285715
1979031,4,B00018U9FW,"Ever since ""High Fidelity,"" it was apparent that Jack Black was a superstar in the making. With ""School of Rock,"" his stretch limo has officially pulled up to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Combining John Belushi's squat body and manic energy with Jack Nicholson's hyperkinetic eyebrows and Dennis Quaid's diabolical grin, Black can get more genuine laughs just entering a room than Adam Sandler can with a movie full of toilet jokes. ""School of Rock""--directed by Richard Linklater from a script by Black's friend and co-star Mike White--is a star vehicle for Black, and while it's no masterpiece, it does display Black's talents to maximum advantage. Black plays Dewey Finn, a down-and-out rock guitarist who cons his way into a substitute teaching job as a way to earn some badly needed dough. His overachieving young charges--almost all of whom are musically talented--he sees as a way to get himself back into the rock world, and in the process of turning them into a rock band he and they learn some wholesome lessons about teamwork, friendship and the need to keep believing in your dreams. Black's fast-talking, cannonballing charisma underlines the genuine sweetness of the tale while effectively undercutting the potential saccharine content. White--who plays Black's nerdy roommate--contributes a script that expertly combines kid-friendly situations with tart adult wit. There is also excellent support from Joan Cusack, as the school's anal-retentive principal with a secret passion for Stevie Nicks, and from a classroom full of gifted young musicians (especially Maryam Hassan, a pint-sized Aretha Franklin). The audience at the screening I attended--ranging in age from prepubescent to late middle age--roared with laughter. Mr. Black, you have arrived!",1065312000,,1763,5.414545454545454
