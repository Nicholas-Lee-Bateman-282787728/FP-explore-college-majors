The two main characters, a Yakuza member named Shuji and his sweatheart from his childhood Hitomi, have a lot of chemistry on screen. You want this pair to end up together despite what they have to go through to get there. This Yakuza movie contained romance as well as the usual abundance of bloodshed and that makes it a rarity among the many Yakuza movies I have watched.  You rarely see women portraying good and believable romantic roles in Yakuza movies. The two main characters also happen to be very beautiful to look at.  The woman has a very natural, old world Japan type of beauty with a gorgeous face and long, shiny hair. The guy is just out and out handsome.  There is something for everyone interested in the Yakuza genre here, violence, loyalty, broken trusts, politics and infighting but also there is this tale of the romance of two people who share a simpler, golden memory of their childhood spent together which helps them overcome the reality of the underground warfare that threatens to overwhelm them. The only real criticism I would have about the film is that sometimes what is probably being said in the Japanese audio and what is showing up in the English subtitles seem to perhaps not be the same thing.  Still, it is the story of undying love set against the backdrop of many people having to die to get you to the happy ending. A happy ending in an Asian movie is in and of itself a pleasant and welcome surprise. The only Heartbreak in the movie that I saw was for all the people who had to get shot up. I give it 5 stars.",1345334400,,1636,4.421926910299003

Yes, there is some violence. What Yakuza movie doesn't have shootings, killings, and blood?  But don't let that shy you away from watching it.  It's more a love story than a gangster movie and is actually very heartwarming.  Shuji is played by Hiromi Go, who was more known as a singer than an actor.  He did a great job and portrays his character's multidimensional quality very convincingly in the movie.

His co-star, also a known star at the time, is also a superb match for him and the chemistry is there right from the start, though his character would deny it.  Why?  You'll see.  Don't want to give any plot spoilers.

The subtitles are a bit off at times.  There's some dialogue taking place with no subtitles present. But it doesn't take any flow from the story and the actor's lines.

Since I've bought this DVD, I've already watched it 4 times.  Obviously, this movie is one of my all-time favs.  Check it out.",1258934400,2,1200,4.431192660550459
