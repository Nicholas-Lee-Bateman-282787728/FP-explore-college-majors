8038821,5,B00065EB1S,"Mark Gray and Spacecraft Films have outdone themselves with this excellent three DVD package devoted to the ""successful failure"" of Apollo 13. Clearly this mission gets its share of attention due to the Tom Hanks movie, and that's a good thing. Hopefully the mainstream movie will awaken the interest of viewers enough to buy this comprehensive set. Apollo 13 stands out for many reasons, but exemplifies for me the capabilities of intelligent, well-trained, resourceful people working together when confronted with a crisis. The DVD set covers the basics of the mission and accident, showing pre-mission planning and training, inflight footage, and coverage of various press conferences, MOCR activity, recovery operations, accident investigation results and panel discussions.

The set has all of the onboard film and TV footage from the mission (including cockpit footage of an actual cislunar burn), and has abundant footage of spacecraft assembly, testing, and rollout, which is always fascinating. There is simulation footage, footage of Lovell flying the always tricky LLTV, and even a brief snippet of Lovell and Haise doing T-38 proficiency flying.

For me, the most interesting parts of the set are the scenes of the MOCR narrated by EECOM Sy Liebergot, and the excellent panel discussion of Apollo 13 flight controllers at a 1995 Houston event. The press conferences are also more interesting than might be expected, particularly the post flight press conference with the three astronauts, the press conference featuring Gene Kranz and other controllers from April 15, 1970 and the press conference with Deke Slayton on April 16, 1970.

All told, this set has a running time over 12 hours long, but for those interested in spaceflight history, the time slips by quickly. This isn't for those with a fleeting interest in manned spaceflight, but for those who desire a complete accounting of the mission, this is the definitive DVD set, and I congratulate Spacecraft Films on the quality of the production.",1254441600,,2015,5.290625
8038822,5,B00065EB1S,"all the spacecraft films are great. And this one is even better. the contents are uncut nasa footage that show you what happened and where there isn't they do there best to combine the video with the audio footage to give you an experience that you are there.
it's great and I'm looking forward to more spacecraft films in the future.",1214524800,,334,4.491803278688525

Apollo 13 gives you footage not seen in any of the many documentaries that

are out there (There's a lot of them), including 16mm Film of the Service

8038824,5,B00065EB1S,"""Apollo 13: The Real Story"" is an information-packed 3-Disc DVD set produced by ""Spacecraft Films"" (a division of ""Red Pepper Creative, Inc."" of Charlotte, North Carolina).*

* = Not to be confused with the 1995 Universal Studios' theatrical motion picture starring Tom Hanks.

You won't find a more detailed and thorough account of the remarkable and nearly-tragic voyage of Apollo 13 than what is presented in this handsome set of DVDs -- that fact is for certain. Why? Because EVERY single scrap of available TV and film footage of the Apollo 13 mission is placed onto these three Digital Discs.

Such as........

>> The complete TV transmissions and onboard film from the nearly one-week-long Apollo 13 mission (April 11 to April 17, 1970).

>> Coverage of the spacecraft's rollout, along with footage of: suit-up, launch, recovery, extensive Mission Control footage during the days following the accident, and footage of world reaction to the successful homecoming of the crew.

>> Exclusive commentary by Sy Liebergot, Apollo 13's lead ""EECOM"" (Electrical, Environmental, and Communications) Flight Controller. Plus additional commentary by Dave Mohr, Propulsion Designer and Engineer.

>> More than 12 full hours of material.

Plus, this DVD collection contains two informative documentary programs as well, which give a very good overview of the events that transpired before, during, and after the Apollo 13 flight.

One of the two documentaries was produced by NASA; while the other one was created for this DVD release by the folks at ""Spacecraft Films"", and was written and produced by Mark Gray. 100% of that program's video footage is comprised of original NASA video (TV and film). Lots of vintage archival Apollo XIII images are shown during that 43-minute documentary, which was put together in 2004 and is narrated quite capably by Linda Emond. A very pleasing and appropriate musical score also accompanies this ""Main Program"" located on Disc #1 of this set.

You can give your DVD Player's ""Angle"" button a good workout during the ""Launch"" segment located on Disc 1. Six separate angles of the Apollo XIII thunderous launch can be viewed and toggled through via the ""angle"" DVD feature on your remote control. There's even a 7th ""composite angle"" option, which places all six of the launch viewpoints on screen at the same time.

The ""Launch"" section also sports a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio track, plus a DD 2.0 Commentary Track as well.

This DVD set is fascinating from start to finish, with good-quality digitally-remastered video footage throughout; and very good audio quality as well. The Menu designs are first-rate and classy too. A very well-done (and fitting) piano music score plays whenever any Menu is on screen. Plus: Each Sub-Menu includes a ""Play All"" option for continuous playback of all the material/programs that are featured on that portion of the disc.

Each of the three discs is single-sided and sports unique 'Apollo 13'-related disc art. A 4-page booklet is also included in this package, with detailed info on all the TV and film footage that can be found on each disc. One of the discs features a great-looking picture of Apollo 13 on the launch pad. A larger version of this same gorgeous pre-launch photo graces the front of the enclosed booklet as well.

Following is a detailed listing of the material that can be found within this 3-Disc DVD compilation .................

Final ""APOLLO 13: THE REAL STORY"" Thoughts.........

This amazingly-comprehensive, in-depth, and well-put-together multi-disc DVD set will appeal to anyone with an interest in America's space program and, in my own opinion, can be regarded as a prized ""collector's item"" by those who enjoy video and DVD material of this nature.

If you want to see and hear every tiny little detail about the near-tragic Apollo 13 aborted moon mission, then this package of DVDs is the package to get.",1117929600,29,9551,5.320026613439787
8038825,5,B00065EB1S,"Spacecraft Films have done it again. Time after time they bring a depth of coverage to the Apollo lunar missions that noboby else can match.

For me the TV transmissions are the real bonus. While I agree with Laurenc that film archive quality is supierior to TV in the 1960's/70's, television is how we witnessed the Apollo miracle 'As It Happened' - live.

I think everyone's heart skipped a beat when finally the 'chutes of Apollo 13 opened live on TV.

This 3 disc set has it all - the press conferences and mission control film before and after the accident. Audio commentaries by NASA personnell, and of course all the onboard film and TV.

There's even a close look at the famous photo of the stricken CM taken just before re-entry, with the air-to-ground audio.

Highly recommended.",1104105600,9,789,4.688405797101449
8038826,5,B00065EB1S,"Having seen just about everything out there on space, when I saw this set I was unsure whether or not there was anything new to be said about Apollo 13. I was pleasantly surprised.

I was 11 when Apollo 13 happened, and I felt even closer to the whole thing because Jim Lovell was my favorite astronaut (I met him when I was younger and he signed a picture for me). The set opens with a documentary that gets reasonably technical about what happened - but I like that. You get the technical stuff and it still brings out the emotion, too. Some of the best things I liked about the set was seeing the press conferences - knowing that they don't know the outcome yet - and seeing the concern on everyone's faces. Watching the TV just before the explosion was also good, as well as the commentary by EECOM Sy Liebergot (played by Clint Howard in the Apollo 13 movie) over the mission control footage.

As usual the material all looked great on DVD, and there were some other extras that were interesting. It's also fun to watch it and watch the Apollo 13 movie - you can specifically see little parts that were lifted directly and other parts that were completely different.",1101859200,9,1171,4.441860465116279
8038827,5,B00065EB1S,"This compilation is perfectly put together and with all related ""surface"" events like MOCR coverages,press conferrences, public reactions it simply brings the atmosphere of those hectic days back from the first alarm to the really whole world relief after successful splashdown. Who experienced the Apollo 13 flight 34 years ago ""live"" like I did is simply back in 1970!

I have one comment however - I fully understand that TV coverage is making the atmosphere and spirit of actuality of this particular mission where really whole world was there through TV, but, the TV quality was not the best one that time and I am missing the film coverage of the splashdown and recovery. This would show this final moment in much better quality than TV. It is ironic to say that the TV coverage from Apollo 13 onboard was much better than the surface TV coverage of landing with many disturbancies. If you look at film recovery footages from Gemini missions and compare it to TV coverages from Apollo flights you see the difference. If I could recommend anything I would add recovery films into each flight material definitely.

Besides of this the material is excellent, valuable and a must in each space fan library.",1101600000,15,1208,4.859223300970874
