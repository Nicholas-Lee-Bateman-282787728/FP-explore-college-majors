8675051,5,B00MWFCU7M,"If it's from BBC, you know to expect something different, from U.S. product..  That is certainly the case here.  The survivors comments and the presentation style, so BBC evident ,only make the program more unique and desirable.  Some of the sites visited I have not seen presented before, some are familiar, but the BBC does it extremely well.  The sad part  is reading the ""In Memoriam"" credits after the program, which reflects some of those appearing in the program.  This program again proves that we owe these men a debt that can never be repaid.  Any awards they received, are well earned and deserved.  An excellent program, as one would expect from anything BBC.",1454457600,,671,4.824561403508772
