2223158,5,B0007MVXRA,"I am an intermediary exerciser.  I wanted a more challenging workout routine, which this DVD exactly gives me. It has a complete exercise routine with weights that I do for a full body workout in 30 minutes, with no bells or frills.

The DVD is done nicely on the beach and there are many cameras showing the exercise from many angles unlike many other DVDs that I have that are filmed in a gym mainly.

I have also started using different weights in different exercises making it a more intense workout routine.

Each exercise is explained and shown first in a simple way. Sunshine is in great shape and always smiling. I exercise early in the morning and seeing the Beautiful Sunny Beach makes me feel good working out.

I like this DVD, because the way the exercises flow seamlessly from one to another non stop giving me a total full body workout this has it all plus a 5 minute relaxation segment after the cool down, that gives me a very good feeling at the end of the workout.

This workout is not for someone that wants to do body building, it is more for firmness, endurance and strength which is what I wanted to add to my training.

I like this circuit training dvd a lot.",1134777600,32,1183,4.39908256880734
2223159,5,B0007MVXRA,"I like working out withthis Circuit & weight training Dvd regularly, it has very good exercises for the whole body.

The exercises are done non stop 3 sets with upper body exercises, lower body exercises, abdominals and ends with The Triple Whammy Set that has a Squat with a Bicep Hammercurl then standing up and doing The Arnold Pushup, and ends with cool down & stretching.

The DVD is done very nicely and the exercises are clearly explained and demonstrated in a very good way by Sunshine showing the proper way & form to do the exercises. There is minimal narration and the exercises are done in perfect timing and sequence.

On days that I want to do a more strenuous or extreme workout I use Heavier Weights.

Another thing that I like about this DVD is that when the set ends there is a small smiling sun :) that comes on screen, which tells me that it is the last one and the set is over so I don't even keep count.

After the cool down I enjoy the added Relaxation Segment with soothing music and nature at the end of the DVD .

I truly am satisfied with this non stop circuit & weight training DVD.",1133827200,61,1110,4.3125
2223160,5,B0007MVXRA,"I was looking for home training dvd with light weights to add to my Funcercise resistance bands exercise dvd and I decided to get this circuit training dvd with weights.

This Dvd is simple to follow and works all the major body parts in sequence and gives me a full body workout in about 30 minutes.

I like the fact that I can alter the intensity of the workout by using lighter or heavier dumbbells and by doing 1, 2, or 3 sets of each exercise. The first and second set are the same exercise and the third set is a slightly different exercise working the same body part.

Sunshine is in great shape, and the dvd  shows an example of each exercise before the first set so it's easy to follow.

I recommend this dvd to everyone that wants to do a simple fast non stop circuit workout with weights.",1133740800,20,799,4.264900662251655

The DVD is done very well and is edited in such a way making it very simple & easy to follow that after a few times I sometimes use my own music Cds while I am exercising with this DVD.

The non stop workout with weights leave's me feeling Strong & I am starting to see results just a few weeks since I have this DVD, and in a few weeks I will start using heavier weights to give me a more challenging Workout as I progress.

This is a Very Good Exercise DVD for anyone that wants to do a Basic Circuit workout with weights. I am loving it.",1133136000,42,1181,4.2

2223163,5,B0007MVXRA,"I am overweight and wanted an effective workout to lose weight and get fit at home without machines & gyms because I do not have 3 hours to travel to gyms and pay the fees, I read the reviews here and I got this Circuit Trainging DVD toghther with the Funcercise Resistance Bands DVD to Rotate my workouts.

In just 4 Weeks, I lost 8 LB and 2 dress sizes which makes me feel Good. This Dvd has a full body workout and a beautiful Relaxation segment after the cool down.

The Dvd is done very professionally and Sunshine demonstrates and explains the exercises clearly making it Simple and Easy for me to do. I also like the music that suits this workout.

I started doing the workout routine slowly as advised in the DVD, and  I did only 1 set for  the first 2 weeks, and 2 sets for the 3rd and 4th week. Now in just 4 weeks I am doing the Entire circuit weight trianing routine Non-stop.

I recommend this Circuit Training Dvd and the Funcercise resistance bands Dvd to anyone that wants to get fit, stay firm and lose weight in minimal time without the whistles & bells of Gyms & Machines.

I went ahead and  got this great Circuit workout DVD with Light weights (that I tuck under my bed) to rotate my workouts. This  Circuit training DVD is easy and simple to follow. The exercises are very effective and target every muscle group. Sunshine shows & demonstrates proper form, which makes it easy to do the exercises correctly. I started by doing one / two set as a beginner and  now in 6 weeks I  do the entire 3 sets non stop. If you want a great circuit training exercise DVD ,this is it!

2223169,5,B0007MVXRA,I am Very Satisfied with this beginners weights exercises DVD.  This DVD has exercises that a person who's just starting out can actually do. The exercises are easy but effective. I feel like it pushes me just enough so that I can feel good about doing something for my body. I would recommend to a person who wants to get some exercise. Sunshine is always smiling and Positive. I love the SUNNY BEACH setting and the beautiful relaxation in the end.,1287187200,4,450,4.555555555555555
2223170,5,B0007MVXRA,"Effective circuit weight training DVD. This workout has it all. I use 5 Lb dumbbells and feel the workout. I got this DVD with the resistance bands DVD to rotate between my workouts and not get bored doing the same exercises. I Lost 18 Lbs in just 3 weeks since I started exercising. This has a full body workout routine with weights and abdominal exercises. The exercises are very clearly explained  and shown first by Sunshine. She does 3 sets of 12 reps of each exercise. I started doing 2 sets in the beginning first few weeks, now I do the 3 sets easily and by next month I hope to use 8 Lb dumbbells. This DVD and the resistance bands DVD does it for me. I am Very Happy with them. Exercise DVDs work only when you use them and these I will be using for a long time. Recommended.",1282003200,4,785,4.198675496688741

2223173,5,B0007MVXRA,"I've never done a workout with hand weights; but recently decided it was time to start.  Since this is my first and only DVD with weights, I have no point of comparison.  But, this DVD is great!  It shows you how to do the exercises within a split second, so you get instructions without it interfering with the pace of the exercises.  The pace is fairly fast, so you are not wasting any time.  You are told the name of the exercise, how to do it, and reminded to breathe and drink water.  This DVD is great for beginners and advanced alike.  Beginners can choose to do fewer repetitions with lighter weights, while more advanced can do all of the repetitions with heavier weights.  I wish there was a little more focus on ab work, but I'll add more abs separately.

The only thing that struck me odd was that it is apparent Sunshine was filmed doing one or two moves of an exercise and then the same shot of her is repeated and/or mirror imaged to make it look different; so she is not actually doing the exercises with you.  This is evident in the fact that the same bird and later the same plane can be seen moving behind her several times over!  During the mirror image shots, the USA on her top appears backwards.  This DVD is narrarated by someone else (not Sunshine); but the voice is very clear and easy to follow.

I like this video and have been doing it at least three times a week; so I believe it is one I will be able to stick with.  With a little added ab work, I'll be well on my way to a fit body!",1225756800,8,1514,4.175862068965517

2223175,5,B0007MVXRA,"Sunshine really gives a good workout in a short amount of time! I only use 5 lb weights and it still kills! This is only my 2nd week using the DVD and I'm waiting for it to not hurt so bad. My husband says it takes 3-4 weeks for your muscles to get used to it. I hope he's right.

The triple whammy is a real killer. I know this will pay off but man it hurts! :)

No pain no gain right?",1205452800,7,386,3.63855421686747
2223176,4,B0007MVXRA,"The workout was good.  It went through all major muscle groups in just 30  minutes.  And you can vary the intensity by using different size weights.

However, there are a couple of things that I didn't like.  The music was mostly the same throughout.  I didn't like it.... some sort of heavy metal.  Even though we are told to BREATHE, Sunshine does not breathe, she just smiles.  There could be a better explanation of the mechanics of each move, especially for beginners.  If you don't know proper body alignment you could get hurt.  The whole thing is a little bit stiff.

The workout is good but just a little annoying.",1201564800,13,623,4.572727272727272

2223180,5,B0007MVXRA,"Put aside the cheesy smiling, instructions to ""breathe"" every few minutes, and the bad music and you have yourself an outstanding, upper-body weight routine.  This workout also includes lower body squats, sit-ups and a lengthy meditation at the end.  The warmup and cool down are both good; the beach background is sunny and positive. The visual cues are clear and well-timed, so you can turn down the volume and listen to your own music. The reason I rate this 5 stars is because the negative aspects are minor in my opinion, compared to the weight workout which is well-paced and thorough.",1165622400,31,591,4.841584158415841
2223181,5,B0007MVXRA,"This is a very good weight training circuit workout.

The exercises are done in a proper way and have a complete full body workout routine starting with a warm-up, then the exercise routine begins with weights.

Each exercise has 3 sets, the first 2 sets are the same exercise and the 3rd set is another exercise for the same muscle group making the exercise more effective and challenging.

I use this DVD 3/4 times a week as my main one to reach my goal.

I am seeing a huge difference in my stamina, strength and firmness in just a few weeks since I started this circuit weight-training workout.

I have many fitness dvds, this is by far the best that I have.",1136678400,86,662,4.39344262295082
2223182,5,B0007MVXRA,"This is an excellent DVD  very well done with a complete workout routine for the entire body with weights.

I like it that the exercises are done non-stop 3 sets with variations for the same muscle groups.

I like the way the exercises flow non-stop, starting with a 4 minute warm up segment going into the upper body and lower body exercises with weights, Then abdominal exercises and finishing with a triplet exercise of 3 different exercises combined into one which ends the exercise portion.

Then there is a 4-minute stretching and cool down, and a special 5 minute relaxation after this intense workout that gives me a great feeling of accomplishment.

Sunshine is always positive, smiling and giving proper instructions and showing a demonstration of the exercise and then starting the exercises making it easy to follow.

This is one super non stop workout routine with weights, that encompasses all the muscle groups, flowing smoothly from one exercise to another, starting with a warmup, upper body exercises moving to the lower body, the abdominals, and finishing with a triple whammy set of 3 exercises in one.

Very well done Dvd that is easy to follow with nice music that suits the workout timing and routine.

8049241,2,B0007MVXRA,"This seemed a very dated (as in 'didn't stand the test of time well' as many workout videos do), low-quality production video in which I felt Sunshine was talking AT me rather than workout out WITH me.  It's dubbed which is a large reason why, and I didn't think that would matter - I mean, it shouldn't in theory, right? - but it does, at least here.  To make matters worse, I found her voice a bit grating although I did get the impression she's probably a very nice person and would make a better in-person workout instructor than one on DVD.

I wanted a beginner workout (I'm 48 and just getting back into fitness after a long hiatus - I used to be a very advanced exerciser) that wouldn't strain my knee joints or hurt my lower back.  I know lunges are popular workout moves, for example, but I didn't like these.  I felt the transitions were choppy and awkward, but I noticed a lot of reviewers thought they flowed nicely, so I guess it's just a matter of opinion.  But let me give you a concrete example of what I'm talking about: She starts with standing moves, then goes to the floor (or in this case, the sand), then suddenly we're standing back up again for more vertical moves.  I really hated that, and it was hard to transition from floor to standing that quickly.

In short, I just didn't enjoy it (After all, it IS billed as a ""Fun Circuit!""), and I didn't even feel as though I got such a quality workout that I could excuse the lack-of-fun factor.  There was absolutely nothing ""fun"" about it.  Even the relaxation segment at the end was more strange than meditative - Sunshine appears in a shrub (I even giggle as I write this!), then we see butterflies, then she's feeding seagulls, and so on.  Odd.  -- I can't say I'll never do it again because I hate to spend money on a DVD and then do it only once, but it will be rare in my workout rotations.  I have a vast collection of exercise DVDs, and this one won't have the dust wiped off of it much!  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because she did work the whole body, some in combination moves which can be very effective if done well. -- I hate to sound so negative in my review, but I have to be honest to help you guys out who scout consumer reviews as much as I do to make well-informed product decisions.",1455580800,,2301,4.247706422018348
