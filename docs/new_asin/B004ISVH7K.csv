4388060,4,B004ISVH7K,"As was heard on last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Velvet-Car/dp/B003TTB0GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Velvet Car</a>, Ann Wilson's voice is still a power to be reckoned with, Nancy Wilson's still got instrumental chops, and the duo fits together like, well, sisters. Though the band's held a steady lineup (save bassist Ric Markmann, who's been replaced by Kristian Attard) since the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jupiter-s-Darling/dp/B000244GFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jupiter's Darling</a>, the group can at times feel more like a backing combo for Ann and Nancy Wilson than a working concern. The guest appearance of Alison Krauss on three tracks is both a treat and a distraction. Her voice is uniquely beautiful as she sings ""These Dreams,"" but it takes the song out of the realm of Heart. The same is true for the group's cover of Krauss & Plant's ""Your Long Journey."" It's a beautiful song, wonderfully sung by Krauss and Ann Wilson, but feels out of place amongst Heart's material.

The set list mostly sticks to the group's hits, non-charting singles and a few album tracks. There are five tunes from Heart's then-latest album, Red Velvet Car, and they blend seamlessly with material from the mid-70s and 80s. Ann Wilson still thrills with rock ballads, but doesn't always hit the high, powerful notes with the same authority of her younger years. That said,  she's a cannier vocalist than thirty years ago, navigating around the minor limitations of age to imbue her singing with new textures and more dynamic range. Nancy Wilson sings lead (and plays autoharp) on ""Hey You,"" Ann Wilson pulls out her flute for ""Mistral Wind,"" and the near prog-rock jamming on ""Mistral Wind"" is superb. The main set closes with a rousing version of ""Crazy on You,"" led off by some powerful, bluesy acoustic strumming.

This is far from a flawless performance - the band's jam on ""Barracuda"" breaks down before catching a second wind, and the signature riff of ""Crazy on You"" seems muddled (much more interesting is guitarist Craig Bartock's soloing on ""Magic Man""). But it's a live show, and the band's got plenty of energy and great songs. The multi-camera video (shot in March 2010 at the Experience Music Project in Seattle) is well lit, and the editing is fluid; at times, two or three video streams are collaged Woodstock-style. There's little between-song patter, which leaves the set feeling compressed; one is left to wonder if the Wilsons simply don't talk much, or if the editors snipped away their interaction with the crowd. This is a nice complement to earlier heart live DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alive-in-Seattle/dp/B00008H2I9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alive in Seattle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamboat-Annie/dp/B000VS6Q6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamboat Annie</a>, and shows the Wilson sisters still rocking in their 50s.

4388063,3,B004ISVH7K,"I LOVE HEART but I was really disappointed in this DVD. There were lots of ""musical"" problems (tempo, pitch, staying together as a band) and even the legendary Ann Wilson's vocals were shaky at times. Also there was no audience interaction.

4388082,5,B004ISVH7K,A must for all Heart fans.  A very inviting atmosphere for a concert.  The ladies never let their fans down!,1384992000,,108,4.35
4388083,5,B004ISVH7K,"I didn't fully appreciate this BluRay disc on the first few viewings. Ann has some weird Frankenstein-looking boots on (I much preferred the barefoot look in ""Alive in Seattle"" (2002) and I thought her voice was not very good that night (I still don't) and plus she seemed to be in sort of a bad place that night.

While all this is true, and I think the performance could have been better in many ways, I still think this disc is a worthwhile investment. Heart, even on a bad night is always worth seeing. Though I should mention that if you merely listen rather than watch, you'll hear what a good performance this is. That's what did it for me.

I think it took maybe 5-6 viewings of the disc to fully appreciate how good it really is. The Allison Krause appearance seemed at first really awkward, but now that I've seen it a few times, it fits in seamlessly. She's a great talent, who much like Heart, need more exposure.

These girls honestly give 110% to every performance, and this is no exception. Their 35-40 years of on-stage experience, combined with stellar natural talent, and really impressive effort, ought to be obvious to anyone who sees them perform. Sadly, it's lost on most people, to my eternal frustration. Maybe some day they'll get the recognition they so richly deserve. :(

Great disc, great performance.",1384560000,2,1330,4.646808510638298

4388097,3,B004ISVH7K,"I am sorry,. HEART keeps releasing DVD's of basically the SAME set list over and over....it is really annoying.
How many versions of BARRACUDA do we need? I beleive this is the 7th or 8th on official DVD.  Heart almost never delves deep into their catalog for rare tracks. It is tyhe same songs over and over.  Hell, they don't even play some of their biggest hits, such as IF LOOKS COULD KILL, a mega-hit. Why don't they ever put it on aa DVD?  They never play any of their cool rare ballads such as JOHNNY MOON or AMERICA. SO many great songs..so many SAME songs. YES, this time there are a Few interesting song choices but they are still mixed in withoo many pf the same old. Girls...scrap the set list. We've all heard Straight On, magic man, and ALone 1000x.",1308614400,4,763,4.359154929577465
4388098,5,B004ISVH7K,"Heart has been around as far as I can remember. This seminal women-led band has definitely left the legacy of being one of the most significant acts in Rock & Roll's history. Sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson have been carrying the tradition since their inception in the musical scene in the 70s, and the public never gets enough of them. ""Red Velvet Car,"" their CD released in 2010, is potent evidence of this -- it marked their triumphant return to the Top 10 charts. ""Heart - Night at Sky Church"" is an absorbing and passionate concert captured in an equally engaging and exciting DVD, in which Heart features their past and present contributions to music.

The concert took place on March 5, 2010, at the Sly Church, at the Wilson sister's hometown of Seattle, and the DVD showcases 18 songs performed that magic night, two presented as bonus tracks.  The band played renditions of some of their hits, such as ""Barracuda,"" ""Never,"" ""Straight On,"" ""What About Love?,"" ""Magic Man,"" and my personal favorites ""Alone"" and ""Crazy on You.""  Furthermore, they also played electrifying tunes from ""Red Velvet Car,"" their 2010 CD release, including ""WTF,"" ""Red Velvet Car,"" Saffronia's Mark,"" ""Hey You,"" and ""Sand."" The bonus tracks are ""Back to Avalon"" and ""Kick it out."" Amazingly enough, the band is joined by Grammy Award-winner Alison Krauss on the songs ""These Dreams,"" Your Long Journey,"" and ""Back to Avalon."" In addition of singing, she also plays the violin.

""Heart - Night at Sky Church"" is colorful, vibrant and with great sound. Ann, Nancy and the band gave their all in pleasing their fans, and it truly shows. Man, you should see Nancy playing that guitar! This is the spirit of Rock & Roll at its best, something that the new generations should study and learn from. (USA, 2011, color, 88 mins).

4388099,3,B004ISVH7K,"Okay, Heart fans are blessed by a proliferation of concert DVDs over the last decade or so.  Another one is always welcome!  One minor complaint about content is that the setlists don't vary too much, and Night At Sky Church offers little ""new"" from their back catalog, but does debut some great Red Velvet Car material on concert DVD!

The biggest problem with this DVD is the sound!  It really sounds awful.  I was actually looking forward to it on the strength of the two live bonus tracks on my edition of Red Velvet Car.  ""Magic Man"" and especially ""Never"" sounded freaking amazing, and I think it's from the same concert.  But the sound on the DVD is awful.  Ann isn't loud enough, and there's just no strength in the sound.  It's like a fairly good bootleg.

If you're a Heart fan like me, you'll enjoy the DVD.  But be prepared.  Good...but disappointing.",1305158400,3,863,4.568627450980392
4388100,2,B004ISVH7K,"It,s too bad that those responsible for creating this DVD used the same standards set to produce a poor quality VHS tape.  The video is unacceptable and the audio is almost as bad.  The only redeeming thing about the DVD is Heart.",1303084800,9,230,4.4523809523809526
4388101,5,B004ISVH7K,"Wow Ann's voice is just as powerfull as ever sounds the same as it ever has

4388102,5,B004ISVH7K,"Was it really 35 years ago that Heart blasted onto the music scene?  It hardly seems possible because they are still better than most of today's current crop of 'artists'.  I saw them perform in August 2009; Ann Wilson told the audience that this was their last stop before going home for a week of rest before the second leg of their tour. They opened with ""Mistral Wind"" (One of my all time favorite Heart songs) and things only got better from there.  Ann Wilson's voice that night was such a revelation that I wondered how it could be that she had lost none of her power and range.  I saw them last summer on the 'Red Velvet Car' tour and the band tore it up again.  Even on an off night, Heart roars.  This DVD is, to my ears, just as enjoyable as 'Alive in Seattle'.  I enjoy the songs with Alison Krause and my only complaint is that the DVD could have been longer - 2 or 3 hours would suit me just fine.  I love Heart and their music and they really do belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",1302825600,,1002,4.102564102564102
4388103,5,B004ISVH7K,"This group has done nothing but deliver truth and style since hitting the airwaves over thirty-years ago, and this performance is another solid example of what they do best.

Ann Wilson's ability to mesmerize remains firm, period. The amazing part is; her mission (still) seems to be fueled by giving the audience everything she has. Her performance is that of a seasoned and solid artist, and she is as beautiful as ever to watch. It's great to see the flute come out, (among the mix of instruments), and watch Ann bring a rock-n-roll flair to a piece of silver tubing with holes in it.  And it kind `a goes without saying; that Ann's vocals are unyielding, rich, and leave me in awe.

Nancy Wilson holds her own; as always, managing to carry a non-stop blissful expression, while bolstering the latest band with an edge of commitment and pride. Her sense of security becomes even stronger when she rips into her guitar work, which again, is an example of a resilient artist that just `kicks butt'.

The new songs are cutting edge...great, energetic, artistic, and they carry the familiarity and ease; that this group has possessed since day one.

This DVD clarifies that their success is not happen-stance; but instead, it's pure talent-from raw and gutsy, to refined and delicate, and here's an example of what happens to dedicated professionals who work hard for so many years.  It's pretty amazing to watch this collaboration of sisters, yes; but artists and committed rock-n-rollers as well.

It's hard to believe that anyone may not know of Heart, but if so; this is a band that should be in your library, and if you're a new artist who wants to see what integrity is all about; here's your chance.",1302739200,4,1705,4.759322033898305
