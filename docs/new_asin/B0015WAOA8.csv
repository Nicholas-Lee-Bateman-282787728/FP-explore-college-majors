8260093,3,B0015WAOA8,"""Iron Angels"" is a fairly run-of-the-mill Hong Kong action flick from the height of the ""girls with guns"" era, made slightly more noteworthy for being the first major role for many of the involved parties: Moon Lee, Alex Fong, Elaine Lui, and Yukari Oshima all got their first lead roles as action stars in this one, and for that alone, the movie's worth watching for enthusiasts. It's not quite special enough to warrant a purchase for me, but it does enough things right to be enjoyable.

The story: a special task force comprised of agents Moon (Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Vampire/dp/B0002CR08Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Vampire</a>), Alex (Fong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Nite-in-Mongkok/dp/B000DN5VGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Nite in Mongkok</a>), and Elaine (Lui,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bride-with-White-Hair/dp/630502054X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bride with White Hair</a>) takes on a sadistic female drug lord (Oshima,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riki-Oh-The-Story-of-Ricky/dp/B00004TJM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riki-Oh - The Story of Ricky</a>).

In many ways, ""Iron Angels"" is overlookable. The Interpol-themed plot is old hat, none of the heroes really stand out as characters, and overall there's not quite as much action as I would have preferred. The film definitely falls under the heading of Sammo Hung's ire, when he claimed that ""too many"" action movies were produced in Hong Kong between the '80s and '90s. With that said, the movie has strengths which help set it apart from similar dreck of the same time. For one thing, ""Iron Angels"" feels a lot more focused than many a Hong Kong feature: the plot could still use some streamlining, but at least the film's not trying to simultaneously also be comedy and a romance like so many others. Additionally, Yukari Oshima's clearly having fun with her part as a sadistic villainess: constantly smacking around her henchmen and enjoying the sight of her prisoners being whipped, she's one of the few bad guys from this era who's actually halfway memorable.

The film doesn't really become a full-blown action flick until its second half, but it's worth waiting for. The fighting cast includes superkicker Hwang Jang Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-in-the-Eagle-s-Shadow/dp/B00006672Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake in the Eagle's Shadow</a>), who has a pretty good fight with Japanese pop star and unofficial fourth ""Angel"" Saijo Hideki (his second fight with Alex Fong, though, isn't that great). Other good fights include a two-on-one wherein Yukari beats up Alex and Elaine, a warehouse battle wherein Moon and Elaine use deadly feminine accessories to take out a horde of henchmen (exploding earrings!), and the finale wherein Yukari mostly fights Moon in a short but furious match. I'm genuinely impressed with everyone's moves and lack of doubling: these aren't the best fights you'll ever see, but fans of just about everybody mentioned will have reason to buy the movie just for the good fights, of which every main player gets at least one.

No other part of the movie is a chore to sit through but there are definite parts that aren't fun, where there's too much talking and plotting going on. If some of these parts were cut for an international release, I don't think too many people would mind. As it is, this one's a slightly above-average time-waster that ought to appeal to fans of lady action heroes, but could have been a lot better.",1357516800,,3698,5.9981060606060606
8260094,4,B0015WAOA8,"when i saw that nobody had written a review for this hong kong action flic yet, i had to do so right away. this movie is one helluva ride as far as the gunplay and fight scenes go! i would have to say this is one of yukari oshima's best movies out there. she plays the main villain and she plays it so well. her kicks(especially her axe kick)are a joy to watch. she's incredible! moon lee does one heck of a job also.  the movie is very much like a hong kong charlie's angels,except the third one is played by a japanese guy. alex fong also helps the team out.  there is some fast and furious gunplay and great fight scenes sprinkled all throughout the movie, but my two favorite scenes show up in the last 20 minutes or so. the great hwang jang-lee shows up as a wildcard character. he seems to be bad at first but shows good intentions toward the end. he gets into 2 fights with the japanese karate expert and really shows off his kicking skills. i always enjoy seeing him in action although these two fights are not too long.  the best fight scene is in the end where moon lee squares off with yukari oshima. and what a fight scene it is!!  this fight is just downright brutal for a girl fight!! it doesn't quite last as long as you would like it to, but whats there is awesome!! this fight is my second favorite one on one girl fight. its very brutal and bone crunching(wait until you see how moon lee takes out yukari...ouch!!!).  my favorite female fight scene was in a movie called 'she shoots straight' with joyce godenzi taking on a muscle bound agnes aurelio. i recommend that movie as well. there is an iron angels two and three but i only have this one and the third one on dvd.  where is the second one available at?  i saw that one on an old vhs tape and it was just as good as this first one.  when it comes down to great fight scenes and overall slambang action, i strongly recommend the iron angel series!!",1240099200,2,1923,4.220708446866485
