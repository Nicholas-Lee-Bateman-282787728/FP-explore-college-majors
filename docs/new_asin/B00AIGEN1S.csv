8552172,5,B00AIGEN1S,This was just the thing to get me in the spirit! How many times do we hear the same tunes over and over? Sharing them with the non-hearing! Wow! This whole series is a fun and inventive way to learn American Sign Language without even trying! Kids and and Adults alike will laugh and enjoy Bob playing Santa and all his antics - you won't know this is the classic you have been missing!,1355875200,,386,4.22972972972973
