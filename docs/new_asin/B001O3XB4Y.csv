3726560,5,B001O3XB4Y,"This very modern movie about 2 straight guys pretending to be a gay couple to share an apartment in the USA and gain quicker citizenship, was a lot of fun.
I gather the gay thing was a bit of a challenge for some conservative Indians but I doubt would raise an eyebrow in the West. The 2 guys are well played by Abhishek Bachchan and John Abrahams who are so secure in their own sexuality that they were able to inhabit the roles and have fun with them without looking awkward. In fact Abhishek is more relaxed than ever and even dances less woodenly. He and John have great 'friend' chemistry and obviously had a ball making it. His comedic timing resists going over the top and is very good.
Priyanka looks suitable gorgeous and acts fine (despite quite a few Bollywood critics who see her as a lousy actress- and in fact often lump Abhishek in with that in acting ability - quite unfairly I think). Bobby Deol also has a small but solid part to play. Not much is required of him but he does the nice guy thing well.
The plot leaves you guessing which guy she'll go for. There was one small part of the script involving manipulating a 5 year old (no spoilers though) that I did feel crossed the line.
There are some quite catchy songs and colorful dance numbers.
It is a light comedy piece - not of the over-the-top slapstick Indian's often like in comedy. It is much more Western in its pitch. I think they played sensitively with the gay thing and I don't think any gay person I know would feel offended by it. On the contrary it adds a certain respect for gays as a legitimate part of the world in a way they generally aren't in Indian movies -  even one of their mothers accept this as 'Gods choice' for them!
I could almost give this a double the stars for the DVD producers finally addressing the needs of the DVD viewer. As the credits roll there is a colourful song and dance number reduced in size to fit next to the names. For the DVD viewer this is always hard to view - and generally is displayed in the same format if you try to select it through the songs menu. This time, after they had finished with the credits and the reduced size number, they replayed the number in full screen. Many thanks from a grateful viewer who finally got her moneys worth!
A lot of light-hearted, well acted fun - and Abhishek is opening up more and more in his range and ability and gives a great performance in particular.",1231200000,12,2420,4.318681318681318
3726561,3,B001O3XB4Y,"This movie was funny, but a bit too long. And the plot was pretty hackneyed. (After all, didn't they make a whole TV series about a guy pretending to be gay so that he could live with a couple of hot girls? We've been down this road once before.)

This was actually my first foray into Bollywood. I can't really believe that people talked this way.

What else? The two guys in the movie were nice looking. It is hard to believe that any man who was able to get women as easily as what we were led to believe that these two could would get so hung up on one woman-- especially when there are so many others available.

Lastly: There were at least a couple of unresolved ends. And that didn't help.

Overall, take this for what it is: Popular comedy/ cinematic kitsch. It is worth seeing for the novelty of Bollywood (for those of us that have not been exposed to it before). But it is not worth a whole movie ticket (at least not to me it wasn't-- a rental would be just fine).",1231027200,,976,4.175531914893617

This movie is riddled with anti-gay jokes and constant sexual references.  How many times do we need to watch them checking out their roommate's backside??  The two men lie to the woman renting the apartment,  then go on to do everything they can to ruin their roommate's life:  they trash her relationships, she ends up resigning in humiliation from her job, the man she hopes to marry retracts his proposal, and then when she confronts them, Sameer gets angry with her because she hasn't noticed he's in love with her!  These two actors play the most incredibly unlikeable characters who don't even suffer the consequences of their horrific behavior.  Why is this movie getting good reviews?  It's certainly not a ""love"" story and the plot idea isn't even new; it's been done elsewhere with much more respect and kindness.  Don't waste your time on this film.

Usually, Abishek Bachchan and John Abraham play heavier tough-guy roles.  However, they excel in comedy!  I think they should do more comedic roles because their timing is right on queue.  I laughed so hard at one point, I almost peed my pants!  I definitely had tears streaming from laughing so much.
It has great music; it is set in Miami so there's familiar scenery for the non-Indian Hindi film fans that would LOVE to see MORE Hindi films made here....maybe with some American actors?  This is the easiest way I can think of to expose more of the American public to the fabulous genre of Hindi films.
It's just LOTS of fun!!  A great place to start if you've been toying with the idea of watching a Hindi movie, but wasn't sure where to start.  A must see!!",1341360000,,888,4.404907975460123

The three main characters are hilarious and the plot is sweet and loving. Abhshek, John and Priyanka make a fantastic comedy trio and I really hope they make more films together in the near future.

What I liked...
-The casting was perfect. Abhishek and John, especially, are hysterical.
-The Westernized subject matter made this film really appealing to my friends who don't usually enjoy Bollywood
-The soundtrack is great... my favorite songs are ""Kuch Kum"" and ""Desi Girl""

What I didn't like...
-Very little if anything

3726585,4,B001O3XB4Y,"Hot! The first-time writer-director, Tarun Mansukhani, pushes a creaky plot - two guys pretending to be gay - to levels of farce. The result is one of fastest paced, and deliriously enjoyable, Bollywood movies in recent memory that is also a comic paen to tolerance. The movie pushes aside the question of ""Are they, or aren't they?"" to the last minute (watch the epilogue, and you may still argue about which side of the fence the boys built their dream home on). In spirit and crackle, if not the drag, this is a Bollywood Some Like It Hot, which not coincidentally was also set in Miami. In the heat, everyone gets gently skewered one way or another, without breaking not so much into sweat but, typically, song. The best of an iTunes-worthy lot: the opener Shut Up and Bounce and the closing Maa Da Ladla remix. The four leads (Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, John Abraham, and John Abrahams toned body) create their chosen family with such astonishing ease, the result is positively infectious and hugely appealing. In this, Dostana, more than any other Bollywood production, nails the exuberance of today's India - super-confident, international to the bone, and polished enough to show Hollywood how its done on its own turf. No wonder Dostana 2 is already in the works. If they can pull it off, Karan Johar & Company will have a franchise on their hands, with the Abhishek-Abraham combo triumphant in almost any setting. Of course, the final installment of such a series would settle the ""Are they, or aren't they?"" question once and for all - and in the affirmative, which this  movie, already, suggests we consider in our hearts. Dostana, you're quite something - a delectable jalebi of movie that also packs an elixir for a better world.",1277942400,,1752,4.820598006644518

I guess I just found the stereotypes so laughable, the songs so over-the-top, the plot so unrealistic, the dialogue so canned, that it is just an explosion of hilarity.

I mean come on, we're talking about the Bollywood version of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.  It's trash humor in top form with a huge budget!",1265068800,,569,4.584158415841584
3726588,5,B001O3XB4Y,"Mumbai crash-lands in Miami, and voil, Bollywood meets 'The Birdcage.' The two go together like sun and sand. The reason it didn't happen sooner is because same-sex romance was a taboo movie topic in India--until 'Dostana' came along, that is. The film isn't preachy about tolerance in the least, but rather, it's a rollicking good time, right from the get-go. Maybe that's why audiences embraced the theme despite its touchiness and turned out in droves.

The film opens with Bollywood's favorite eye candy, John Abraham, emerging from the ocean Ursula Andress-style--a shimmering Adonis in tight swim trunks. Hero No. 2, Abhishek Bachchan, pulls up in a pink fishtail Cadillac with a bevy of babes in the back seat. And a bikini-clad Shilpa Shetty performs the catchy number ""Shut Up and Bounce"" along Miami's South Beach, cavorting with the two men. But wait--isn't the movie about a gay relationship? No, but it is about acceptance of gay relationships, done in the spirit of 'La Cage Aux Folles.' Instead of two gay men pretending to be a straight couple, two straight men pretend to be a gay couple.

The film firmly establishes that the main characters, Sameer (Bachchan) and Kunal (Abraham), like women--a lot. They're macho lady-killers who meet one morning over breakfast after shacking up with two women who live together. Kunal is a fashion photographer who has access to gorgeous women galore, while Sameer is a nurse, who's secure enough in his masculinity to comfortably work in a female-dominated field. They run into each other again when they both show up to rent the same apartment, and both are turned down by the landlady, who doesn't want virile young men as tenants, since they'll be sharing the place with her niece, Neha (Priyanka Chopra). They don't want to pass up the chance to live in this incredible pad, so they tell the landlady they're gay and she decides to make an exception for them. The problems begin when they meet Neha and both are immediately hot for her, but they can't reveal the truth to her or they'll get thrown out. The three become close friends as they hit the beaches and clubs of Miami. The comical complications pile up when Sameer's mother, who's unaware of her son's ruse, shows up for a visit, along with an immigration officer, who's checking to make sure their relationship is legitimate since they applied for permanent residency as a same-sex couple. When Neha starts dating her boss, Abhi (Bobby Deol), Sameer and Kunal--now completely in love with her--do everything they can to break them up, with hilarious results. Of course, only one of these three men can have her, and all of their friendships end up on the line.

3726590,5,B001O3XB4Y,"Hop on board a rollercoaster of outlandish fun in Mansukhani's Dostana (2008).  Brace yourself for two and half hours of pure belly laughter as you're introduced to Sameer (Abhishek Bachchan) and Kunal (John Abraham), two unlikely bachelors who through false identities discover the value of friendship.
  In search of a new apartment in sunny Miami, Florida, Sam and Kunal's paths cross when they find themselves interested in the same venue.  Much to their dismay, the landlord refuses them tenancy; less they corrupt her strikingly beautiful niece, Neha (Priyana Chopra).  After being wrongly pegged as a gay couple, the two men cleverly ditch plans A and B, and head straight for Plan ""G"".  Posing as a gay couple, Sam and Kunal are granted residency as Neha's roommates, unaware that the position will cost them not only money, but also their hearts.
 After the trio becomes best friends, both Sam and Kunal find themselves hopelessly in love with Neha.  Mansukhani's cinematography ingeniously accentuates this sexual tension throughout the film.  Emphasizing the sexuality of the male body, Sam and Kunal are often seen half nude or in suggestive positions.  This compliments the films efforts to humorously address homosexuality.  The duo is often caught in presumably ""gay"" situations, who's hilarity renders offensiveness a non-issue.
 ""Who's the hottest girl in the world?""... Neha of course!  In the film's hit single, ""Desi Girl"", Neha, Sam and Kunal sing about the power and beauty that a Desi Girl possesses.  Panning up and down her vivacious curves, Neha's body becomes the prime focus as she sings of how she's the girl of every man's dreams.  Full-body shots accentuate the song's purpose to objectify Neha, and emphasize the sexual prowess and untamed desirability that have made Sam and Kunal's illusion harder to maintain.
 The difficulty in upholding their gay faade becomes increasingly evident when Abhimanyu Singh (Bobby Deol), the new editor-in-chief of Verve magazine becomes yet another contestant for Neha's heart.  Through split-screen shots, Mansukhani's portrayal of the competition between Sam and Kunal, and later Abhi is skillfully depicted.  Throughout the film, a split-screen is used to show Sam and Kunal hailing the same cab, arguing over the idea of forging a homosexual relationship, and later with Abhi to emphasize the love square between the three of them and Neha.  This cinematographic element aids in the portrayal of rivalry evident throughout the film.
 Resolutions are finally reached in a grab bag of surprising events.  Sam and Kunal come clean about their sexuality, Neha realizes her love for Abhi, and all three learn the meaning of friendship.  Mansukhani's Dostana is a delightful comedy that falls nothing short of clever.",1256428800,2,2782,5.289293849658314
3726591,5,B001O3XB4Y,"The movie Dostana, directed by Tarun Mansukhani, takes place in Miami, Florida. The three main characters in the movie are Sam, (Abhishek Bachchan), Kunal, (John Abraham), and Neha,( Priyanka Chopra). Sam and Kunal are both Indian boys who live in Miami and are trying to find a place to live. Sam is a nurse at a local hospital and Kunal is a photographer. They derive this plan to pretend that they are gay in order to be able to live in this apartment that the owner, Baby, will not rent to boys. Everything is well, and Baby is going to let them live there, but then Sam and Kunal meet Baby's attractive niece who also lives there, Neha. Both instantly realize that pretending to be gay and living with this beautiful woman is going to be a problem.
 The movie comes across as being a romantic film about two young boys looking for love, but in reality it is a comedy. Both Sam and Kunal are in love with Neha at first sight but cannot do anything about it, because they have to seem gay in order to live there. This involves Kunal and Sam shopping with Neha and pretending that they are dating. Neha even invites over her gay boss to meet Kunal and Sam which makes things a lot more complicated for them. They now have to not only trick Neha and her aunt, but also try to deceive Neha's boss who is really gay. The movie goes on to tell the story of how Sam and Kunal love Neha but she thinks they are gay so she falls in love with her new boss at work. This is when things start to get crazy. Kunal and Sam don't want Neha to be with Mr. Singh because they secretly both love her. So they start pretending to be Mr. Singh's friend and trick him into doing things that Neha hates hoping that she will eventually leave him. In the end, Sam and Kunal plan is a complete failure and Neha and Mr. Singh end up getting married and Sam and Kunal are forced to move out of the apartment after exposing their secret to Neha.
 The background music, directed by Vishal Dadlani, was very noticebale. The music was always appropriate for the situation that was going on and kept the audience involved. It was upbeat and modern, which helped to express the emotions of the characters at the given situation. The cinematography in the film was mainly shot two ways. The camera either focused on the main person a lot or shot from over the shoulder. Both of these shots helped to show the emotions of the character, and how the emotions of the other character in the frame were being expressed. For instance, when Kulan and Sam finally told Neha their secret a head shot of Neha was done to show her sadness.
The movie Dostana is a romance comedy with a few twists in it. I didn't expect the two men that we were first introduced to, to come up with a plan of pretending to be gay. I never at one moment found myself bored or daydreaming because Sam and Kunal brought a lot of comedy to the film. Overall, with not being an expert when it comes to Bollywood cinema, I would say that this is a very good and well directed Bollywood film.",1256428800,,3026,4.307017543859649
3726592,4,B001O3XB4Y,"Dostana is a great tale of friendship and love with a twist of comedy.  Sam (Abhishek Bachchan) and Kunal (John Abraham) are two single, good-looking fellows who keep crossing paths.  They both set out to find an apartment in Miami, where they meet Neha (Priyanka Chopra), a beautiful young girl. The only apartment they can find is with Neha and they are both ecstatic until they learn that Aunty will not allow that in fear of the boys hitting on Neha.  So they come about an absurd idea to pretend they are a gay couple.  This of course works so they continue to act gay and land themselves in some hilarious situations.  The two fall in love with Neha which stirs up trouble because Neha, unaware of their feelings, has already fell in love with her new boss.

 There are many ideas portrayed in this film.  For instance, everything happens for a reason.  Dostana shows the lives of two individuals-Sam and Kunal.  In a split screen, director Tarun Mansukhani, freeze frames the two to illustrate they are the main characters.  The scene suddenly turns into an overhead shot of Sam and Kunal getting into the same taxi.  That is where they meet for the first of many times and ends up being an incredible friendship.  There are many emotions throughout the film, such as love, humor, lies, and friendship so the frequent close-ups and mid shots express how the character was feeling at the moment.  Another idea I recognized in Dostana is if you commit the crime you need to pay the fine.  Sam's mother was a conservative Punjabi so when this ""relationship"" got back to her, she reacted in a fanatical manner.  There is a scene when she shows up at the apartment and the two boys are dancing to a song with other men, one being Neha's gay boss.  This drives Sam's mother up the wall as the many high angle shots show her desperation.  Her reaction is a prime example of how the film depicts stereotyping. Because of their actions, Sam and Kunal's hearts got broken when Neha chooses to marry her new boss. Although neither of them got the girl, they formed an unexpected but unbreakable friendship.

 I really enjoyed this movie; I found it to have a good storyline incorporating humor into it.  If you have a good sense of humor as I do then I would recommend seeing it.  If stereotyping is a subject that you don't find funny, you wouldn't enjoy this movie.  Although Dostana is not the best film I've ever seen, it was an entertaining film that kept me very interested.",1256342400,,2476,4.577272727272727
3726593,5,B001O3XB4Y,"Dostana is a romantic comedy set in the vibrant, energetic city of Miami. Kunal and Sameer are two ""boys will be boys"" kind of guys. They meet by chance after spending the night at an apartment shared by two girls. Kunal and Sam keep bumping into each other the next day, and they realize they are even looking into renting the same apartment. However, the owner is looking for women only, as her aunty does not want her to be corrupted by the presence of men in the house. When Kunal and Sameer see how magnificent the apartment is, they pretend, in a moment of desperation, that they are a gay couple. Trouble starts when they meet their housemate, Neha.  Both Sameer and Kunal immediately fall in love with her. At first, the attraction only seems surface deep. But as the story progresses, stronger, more intimate relationships are established. More conflict and comedy ensue when Neha's boss, Abhimanyu Singh, takes an interest in her too. Will Sameer and Kunal be able to keep up the guise of a gay couple, or will their true feelings bring their lies crashing down around them?
  Dostana deals with contemporary and age-old themes of sexuality. Kunal's and Sameer's role as a gay couple, while more acceptable in contemporary America, is met with conflict when Sameer's conservative mother finds out that he is ""gay."" In order to explore these deeper emotions and conflicts, the film incorporates song in to the story. The music and dances are very lively and entertaining, providing a nice break in the dialogue. The songs also provide clues as to the underlying feelings of the characters. A song titled ""Maa Da Laadla"" is funny, yet it also reveals how disappointed and upset Sameer's mother is that he is gay.
  Overall, Dostana never seemed to have a dull moment. The film is rich and vibrant, with lots of upbeat, contemporary music. The success of the film is also due to the great chemistry between the cast members. John Abraham plays Kunal and Abhishek Bachchan is Sameer. Priyanka Chopra plays Neha , and Bobby Deol is her boss, Abhimanyu Singh. Dostana is directed by Tarun Mansukhani and the soundtrack is composed by Vishal-Shekhar.

Watch it if you you're looking for a couple of hours of entertainment without any emotional undercurrents.",1246060800,3,279,4.9361702127659575
3726597,5,B001O3XB4Y,"Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, and John Abraham are the best couple in history. I love this movie so much that I recommended to all my friends. They even bought copies. Absolutely fantastic movie.",1238371200,3,201,5.121212121212121
3726598,5,B001O3XB4Y,"I watched the movie at a Film Festival in Miami since my sister was a dancer in it.  I didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be an extremely well made and entertaining movie.  It's hilarious and charming.

If there are bad reviews about this movie without explanation, it's probably because that person doesn't like singing and dancing. However, there really isn't anything wrong with it. This was my first Bollywood movie and definitely not my last.",1235606400,7,461,4.7375
3726599,1,B001O3XB4Y,"This is the WORST movie in the WORLD.

I paid $13 to see it in the theater.  I want my money back.

The music is hideous, the clothing laughable, the acting nonexistent.

This is an Bollywood remake of Chuck and Larry, which stars Adam Sandler and Kevin James.  So you know the level of ""quality"" you are getting.

Why did I bother paying money to see this?  I figured the terrible reviews were exaggerated, because Abhishek Bachchan's films are usually good.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen with this one.

Save yourself years of mental torment, give this flick a pass.

If you want to see some of Abhishek Bachchan's good dramatic films, see Guru or Sarkar.  Or for something lighthearted and fun, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom or Bunty Aur Babli.  But for God's sake, don't see Dostana!",1233014400,5,779,4.605839416058394
3726600,5,B001O3XB4Y,"I loved the film! Music, dancing and clothes are great. Priyanka looks lovely all the time. John & Abhishek look sexy, but you can fall in love for both, as they go from funny to tender. You can laugh a lot, no matter if you are straight or gay. There is a good message for a conservative society (or even conservative sectors of our ""modern"" societies), as being gay is defended and the most traditional character in the film finally accepts the ""gay"" couple. Which is the ending of this story? You can take your choice. I decided to look at the subtle body language of characters in the last scene and considered music video played during credits as an epilogue. Even my 71 y.o. mom loved this film.",1231718400,5,701,4.441860465116279

8329229,5,B001O3XB4Y,"The movie is well made, plot is flat out hilarious, the script is well written.  Direction is worth the praise, best thing about the movie is the casting.  Every character was on the dot, from the two roommates to the main girl to the aunt, to the girl's boss who happens to be her love interest.
Actors carried the movie well on their shoulders. Performances were flawless and effortless.
Only negative was the music which was irrelevant to the plot and it got annoying and too long.  Other than that enjoyed it so much that had to buy a copy.",1460764800,,544,4.42

8329232,5,B001O3XB4Y,"It's a fun movie, ridiculous premise but whatever. The whole thing is a funny go around and neither guy gets the girl. The music is a lot of fun, the dancing too. I don't know why people have to try and rip things apart because it's two straight guys pretending to be gay to get a good apartment, which happens to have the perk of having a hot chick living there. Its different than most Bollywoods that have a more traditional path, but doesn't make this any less of a fun and amusing movie. I read on review that complained it was to long, they obviously haven't seen many Bollywoods lol. If you are looking for a movie that has a touch of romance, has catchy music and dancing and is just laugh out loud funny in most places, touching in others, head-desking in a few. Its sexy, fun, energetic and a little twisted, but a great ride",1452211200,,835,4.291139240506329
8329233,5,B001O3XB4Y,"An incredibly well made Bollywood film, this was filmed in high definition with very beautifully chosen colour palettes and shooting. The first five minutes are a little out of place and don't add much to the movie, so don't worry if it just seems like an out of place music video, but it definitely sets the fun mood for the rest of the film.
All of the actors are phenomenal and hilarious and fun, and everything is kept lighthearted and campy. It can get a little predictable, and some people might say it's TOO campy, but that's half the fun of Bollywood anyways. The songs and dances are fun and catchy, and the dvd is not region locked, so fear not! Subtitles are available in English, Arabic, Dutch, Telgu, and Tamil, so you'll be able to enjoy this with the whole family",1452124800,2,778,4.485915492957746
