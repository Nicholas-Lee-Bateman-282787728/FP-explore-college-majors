5276011,5,B00977MM1C,"This  is a series I have been waiting for a long time. It is one of the reasons I bought an all region DVD player . So far is playing very well. There is nobody else to do this kind of program ,like sir David Attenborough and the BBC. I am enjoying every minute of it, I am sure  I will watch it many times. I ordered the Trials of Life and looking forward to it",1397952000,,362,3.75

5276013,3,B00977MM1C,"I chose a mid-range rating because I inadvertingly ordered the blu-ray not realizing it was a B region blu-ray. Of course I was terribly disappointed. Will keep my hopes up that an A1will someday be available.

5276014,1,B00977MM1C,"This disc is for region 2. it won't play on our machine, and because we didn't get around to watching it for awhile, I now realize that it is past the return window. At the time I got it, and at the time of this review, the description says nothing about this being a region 2 disc even though Amazon obviously knows where each customer is from. Very disappointed.",1369785600,,364,4.2898550724637685

 http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B008RA57W6/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1

I just received my copy today and tested it on a number of blu-ray players. None of the Sony or Panasonic BD players I tested could play because this set is indeed 50 Hz encoded. However, my regular Region 1 / A Toshiba , JVC and Philips BD players (bought in the USA) can play this set with no problem since they automatically convert 50 Hz to American 60 Hz. The set is Region uncoded but 50 Hz encoded. If it were both Region B/2 and 50 Hz then none of my BD players could play it but clearly that was not the case.

I believe most Toshiba, JVC and Philips BD players can play this. The only exceptions I know are the oldest Toshiba BD player bdx2000 which uses a Panasonic chip and some ""fake"" Philips (Funai re-branded as Philips). I think some Pioneer, Sharp, Samsung & LG can play this too but I no longer have those brands (they worked on my 50 Hz encoded ""Wonders of the Solar System"" from the UK before). Note the regular DVD version is both Region 2 and 50 Hz encoded. The blu-ray version is only 50 Hz encoded but Region uncoded. I now know because I own both versions. If you are not sure, check the user manual for your model or call the manufacturer about whether your model can play 50 Hz encoded titles (and auto convert to 60 Hz for your American TV).",1362960000,12,1424,4.576470588235294
5276016,5,B00977MM1C,"I own the severely abridged 2 cassette VHS version and have waited many years for the full 13 episodes (at 55 min. per episode) in any format [Blu-ray/DVD] I can play on Region A/1 players.  I started a discussion thread titled ""Any plans for a Region Free or A/1 release?"" posted in the Customer Discussions > Life on Earth [Blu-ray] forum on Nov 27, 2012 to alert U.S. buyers of this very problem.  Guess the previous reviewer missed it.  It's buried at the bottom of the page.

Back then, it was clearly stated in the Product Details section that this was
Format: Import
Region: B/2.
Amazon even notified me that it was available on 10/17/2012 with an e-mail: ""Subject: Life on Earth [Region 2 Import - Non USA Format].""

I'll take another reviewer's word for it that there may be no indication on the packaging that states this is a Region B/2 product (it was made for the European market), but by that time, isn't it already too late?  Why penalize the documentary's content which that reviewer clearly admires and saddle it with a one-star rating, when it might be more appropriate to blame himself?  To be fair, it might be nice for Amazon to mention this up front on the Product Title (like the e-mail I received) to prevent further problems.  At least three people have already made this mistake.

I agree with the previous reviewer that as for the program itself, it rates 5 stars.  Go to Amazon UK for some great product and technical driven reviews.  Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for something geared for the U.S. market.  I've waited for years already.

Here's the warning posted at Amazon UK:
Please note that this product will not play on US spec 60i Blu-ray players as the Blu-ray discs are authored to UK 50i specs.",1361059200,7,1791,4.757281553398058
5276017,1,B00977MM1C,"I recently purchased this program, having waited decades for it to be released on disc. About 2 weeks ago, the description here on Amazon did not specify which Region this set was, so I assumed, incorrectly, it was for region A/1.  Once I received it, it would NOT play on either of my blu-ray players, nor was there any indication on the packaging that is was for Region B/2.

Unless you have a region free player, this is not for USA consumption. I returned mine (along with Trials of Life), and got a refund. I will be contacting BBC Earth to see if there are plans to release this for Region A.

As for the program itself, it rates 5 stars.",1360800000,16,644,4.305785123966942

The last time I watched these I was just a kid and the TVs of the 80s did not do this video justice.  Attenborough fans do not need to be told how good this series is.  What I wanted to add is a note about region playability.  I took a risk purchasing this as it seems most US BluRay players will not play the discs.  A prior review noted it would play on the PS4, and I am happy to confirm that this is the case.  I am not an expert on the region specific codes, 50Hz vs 60 Hz, etc, but suffice it to say these discs play perfectly on my PS4.  If you don't own one already, having this series on BluRay is all the reason you need to buy a PS4 now.",1447545600,2,760,3.8333333333333335
