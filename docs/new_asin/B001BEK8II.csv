The original version shown on TV had several scenes with Lorena Herrera, although she was not what you would call a major player. Almost all of these scenes have been omitted, so skip this DVD if you are a Lorena Herrera fan.",1249776000,2,427,4.271604938271605

8282790,1,B001BEK8II,"I watched this soap years ago on TV and loved it. It's really one of the most hysterical soaps I have ever seen. I bought this DVD to bring back some of the memories and was disappointed. The DVD is missing MANY,MANY,MANY scenes. The worse part is that it's is missing some of the funniest scenes that connect the story. Most of the DVD doesn't make sense to someone seeing it for the first time because new characters come out of nowhere and the story just keeps skipping over and over parts to get to the end. I watched the DVD in two weeks because I paced myself, but I could have easily seen it all in two days or even one day. The real soap is very long and funny, but this edited version is too short. The editors left out the best scenes and kept some of the mediocre scenes that drag on and on. I gave this DVD a star because it had some funny scenes as it is a funny soap, but don't expect an intelligent piece of work. The original version is really a great piece of work- as you see how money does not buy class or love. Those topics are what what makes the soap so hilarious!  If you don't mind being completely confused with this story jumping all over the place then buy it. At least it'll make you laugh and you can play the guessing game and fill in the blanks (or missing scenes).",1279152000,3,1297,4.126482213438735
