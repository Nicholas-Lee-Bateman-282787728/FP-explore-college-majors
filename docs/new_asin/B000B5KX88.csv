Video quality far superiour to VHS, multiluange audio and subtitles, high-quality multi-channel sound, easily accessible menu navigation system, the list goes on and on...

Enter the Kombat Klub's idea of a DVD:

Step 1) Take a previously recorded VHS tape.

Step 2) Insert it into an old VCR which produces jumping picture (ah, the ""golden 80s"") and subpar (squeeking) sound.

Step 3) Record entire tape to a cheap DVD-R.

Step 4) Generate a menu system with a single button - hey, at least it says ""Play""!

Step 5) Grab a grainy frame from the video and do some minor Photoshop editing to extract Luca Valdesi from the dojo background. If you look at close-up of the cover, you'll notice just how bad the Photoshop extraction is.

Step 6) Create a cheap DVD label that doesn't even say which DVD of the series it is (A, B, C,...) or list any katas which are on it. Hey, who needs it when we've got that cool KombatKlub.com logo?

To sum it up, never in my life have I seen such a terribly produced DVD. Not even amateur home-made discs are this bad.

Luca is a great athlete, one of the very best in the world among kata performers. What a disgrace.",1139961600,2,1190,4.493023255813953
