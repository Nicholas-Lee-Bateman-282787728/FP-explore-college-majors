One of my favorites, along with Alex is the talentd personality Mari.  I  would love to see her in another show..as I love her clothing, her humor and her work ethic.  Nice job Mari and thanks Amazon for marketing this 3 disc set.",1354579200,,338,4.508196721311475
8512219,5,B0077TVQ2S,"24 Hour Catwalk is, hands down, the best fashion related reality show I've ever watched. It has humor, drama, fashion and other things that are enjoyable. But the best part is the recurring character of the seamstress Mari. Calling her a seamstress doesn't feel fair to her but my vocabulary is limited. She deserves her own show and all the riches and fame commensurate with her appreciable talents and winning personality.",1354579200,4,424,4.985915492957746
