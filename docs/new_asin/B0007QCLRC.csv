8050482,4,B0007QCLRC,"Hasta Que Perdio Jalisco(1945) is a solid film from Mexican Cinema's Golden Age, but it takes the safe way out and never achieves greatness. Still, it's a retro delight and one can watch it with the whole family. Jorge Torres(Jorge Negrete) and his friends adopt a baby boy that Torres' sister carelessly abandons. Torres also has a crush on a sophisticated, rich lady played by Gloria Marin. Marin oozes sensuality and good looks. Negrete and Marin were dating in real life. This may explain why the two had chemistry on screen. Hasta Que Perdio Jalisco is worth a look.",1272499200,,571,4.777777777777778
