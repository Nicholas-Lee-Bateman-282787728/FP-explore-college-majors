7919704,5,B0000488W9,"I viewed this video prior to giving it to my parents, who are just learning computers, and found it an excellent introduction and overview of use of computers running Windows 98 or 95 for newcomers to computers of any age...my children, also learning computers, enjoyed it, and learned from it, as well. The producers present an interesting and comprehensive overview of computer use, and hone in on the specifics of desk top program and file management, after an initial introduction that begins at the beginning: how to turn on the computer, how to use a mouse, etc. It moves on to more advanced uses including creating desktop shortcuts, playing solitaire, copying files to floppies, and installing and running new programs from a CD rom. This will eliminate the reluctance that many interested but intimidated seniors (or novices) might have, and get them up and running with computer basics. I only hope, for my parents sake, that there is an Intermediate or Advanced Computers for Seniors in production to pick up where this leaves off.",979084800,20,1042,4.994252873563219
