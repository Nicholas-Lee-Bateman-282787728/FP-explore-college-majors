7734334,4,B01EE8BWT6,"The monsters are very well done in this movie, nasty buggers.  Some folks may have an issue with a couple of short patriotic type songs sung by soldiers on a train, some workers, at a school etc, but let's face it, it's really not any different than the requirement here in the U.S. that the national anthem gets sung before very sports event, 'god bless America' in the 7th inning stretch of baseball games, the pledge of allegiance in school etc.  You can always turn the subtitles off during the songs anyhow.  By the way, when I first inserted the disc into my player it went back to the dvd player screen instead of playing, but I tried taking it out and trying it again it worked.  Interestingly enough, both the 3D and the 2d version is on the same disc.  I don't have 3D, but the 2D version looked sharp to me.  Cool movie.  Plus let's face it, Hollywood movies are all the same today, plus they are all so incredibly uptight with political correctness, please Hollywood, get that political correctness stick out of your ***.  Hopefully they will translate the books these are based on to English sometime",1462838400,7,1113,4.53
7734335,5,B01EE8BWT6,"One of the very few Asian films I've enjoyed that wasn't from Japan, but I never thought I'd end up liking it so much. It's like an awesome mixture of Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, The Lost World, 47 Ronin, and even Godzilla all rolled into one. Based on the Chinese novel series ""Ghost Blows Out the Light"". Although I've never read them, these stories must be really good blockbuster material, since they made a second film based on them ""Mojin the Lost Legend"" which I loved watching as much as this one.",1507766400,,519,4.591397849462366

7734341,5,B01EE8BWT6,"This movie is how Chinese Scence Fiction rolls. Please give it an English soundtrack and it would do well in the States (!!) The cinematography, camera work and CGI is breathtaking. I watched it in Chinese without any subtitles and still was incredibly engrossing....an archaeologist expedition explores the ruin and fossils from an ancient civilization and find evidence of war possibly inter-dimensional. Here the plot almost writes itself (but what a fantastic delivery) with watchers, guardians, genetic descendants and the ten thousand year struggle to either resume or prevent the resumption of Earth destroying hostilities. The locale is in the Mongolian badlands, not unlike the American Southwest. It has a Lord of the Rings and Raider of the Lost Ark feel to it in a backdrop of dark machinations human and demonic.. And probably the best CGI monsters you will see in the business, almost flawless terror, The play on a separate human species hidden within the human race is such a common theme it makes you wonder if there actually is such a thing?  Buy it and put it in your collection.",1483315200,,1098,5.0
7734342,5,B01EE8BWT6,"I tought this movie was pretty good, and different. The effects and production values were high. Sometimes it may seem to be hard to follow, but that may be a cultural thing in how we view things in the west. It has a lot of action, some humor, surprises, mystery, magic. It's not specifically about dragons, dinosaurs and such, though they do appear in the movie, if only to carry some plot points.

There are some surpirse at the end, and the story is somewhat wrapped up. There are a couple of scenes were the actors break out in song, I just fast farwarded past those very small bits. Again, that may be common in Asian movies, I'm not sure.

I think this would peal to any age (as long as they can read and follow the subtittles).
If you get tired of the same old cookie-cutter US movies, try this one, and get another perspective on film.",1483315200,,844,4.3354430379746836

With that said, this film was fantastically lively and engaging in its story- line. It was humorous, Visually stunning and
Incredibly uncommon in its story and setting. It is the kind of film that is such an outlandish 'slap in the face' that it hijacks the imagination and blows it up with ""what ifs?"".",1475539200,,633,5.038095238095238

It centers on the professor, his daughter and Hu Bayi, a soldier/worker in love with Ping, the daughter. A group of volunteers investigate a newly discovered passage in an archeological dig, only to discover the Demon Pagoda, which they partially activate.

They end up battling ridged back Wargs. There is also an Elvis impersonator who sings praises to Genghis Khan. There are also songs which praise the worker and the party as if to mock 1950's Russian film. The cinematography was excellent. The love story didn't cross cultural lines that well. Movie includes doses of philosophy. The production is a combination of ""The Sirius Conspiracy"" and LOTR.

7734379,3,B01EE8BWT6,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If a film boasts giant creatures, you can bet Ill be eager to check it out.  Ive mentioned many times before that Im a creature-feature junkie, so if the beasts are larger than life (literally), then Im set to be happy.  The fine folks at Well Go USA released a film today titled CHRONICLES OF A GHOSTLY TRIBE, which features just such monsters.  And while its not a perfect film, it is still entertaining and fun, a decent addition to the genre.

CHRONICLES OF A GHOSTLY TRIBE is shot very well and has a great appearance onscreen.  The breathtaking landscape is captured in vivid detail by the cinematography, and the camerawork is top notch.  Add in a nice dose of super CG animation, and the result is a collection of spectacular imagery.

The acting is nice as well.  Although nobody gives a breakout performance, there are no wooden portrayals or cardboard characters that should have been shelved.

As mentioned, the special effects in CHRONICLES OF A GHOSTLY TRIBE are excellent.  The CG imagery is crisp and well done.  My sole complaint about the effects is not so much the execution as it is the concept behind the creatures that attack the mining town.  Instead of terrifying, they look like nothing more than recycled werewolves from another film.

The biggest problem I find with this film is in the story itself.  To be honest, its pretty choppy, a jumbled mashup of several different storylines.  This actually wouldnt have been so bad if the writers had chosen to follow-through on one or two of them; but instead, the film comes across as a picture thats trying too hard.  The resolution of the story makes you scratch your head, and Im still not sure if my assumptions are accurate.

There are also a couple of inconsistencies that stand out.  For example, the legend starts off by calling the creatures that came to earth aliensbut then later they are referred to as demons.  Later still, its back to aliens.  The flip-flopping got annoying.

But I cant deny I enjoyed CHRONICLES OF A GHOSTLY TRIBE otherwise.  Its over-the-top fun with some hair-raising moments and plenty of tension.  The action is entertaining, and the visuals are excellent.  Overall, I recommend the film for what it is, and I suggest giving it a shot.  If you can overlook the storyline flaws, you're in for a treat.",1467676800,,2382,4.707021791767555
