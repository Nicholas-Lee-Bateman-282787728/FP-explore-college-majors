I agree with the first and second raters. The narrators, who are also, most likely the photographers, as well, had accents which make it at times, difficult to understand.
They exhibit, at best an elementary understanding of the areas and cultures on which they purport to report. This gives the impression that this was produced as a means to a tax write-off, allowing them to fund the trip on the US taxpayer's back.
If they had done even the most basic amount of research, they would have known, contrary to their claims that The Buddha did not found a religion. In fact he spoke against the need for religion.
Suggest you seek knowledge elsewhere...just watch the pictures, as suggested above, without sound. It could have been so much better, but I guess the IRS standard for vacation reporting is not very high.",1425600000,,864,4.728476821192053

8429128,1,B001JP631K,"Two people with South-eastern US accents (like mine) with little to no understanding of Asian religions take a tour of Nepal and Ladakh, the birthplace of two of my Buddhist teachers, Lama Zopa Rinpoche from Nepal and Gyurmed Khensur Rinpoche Lobsang Jampa of Ladakh. Their unbelievably boring account of their trip to one of the most beautiful areas of the world is best viewed with the sound off. The account is respectful but quite ignorant of the qualities of the religions of the area. The video shows no evidence is that the travelers actually spoke to anyone in either area. The ""narration"" sounds like a elementary school child's book report. Ex: Images of the Buddhist ""Wheel of Life"" are shown and referred to as ""Tantric Themes"". Pretty pictures of scenery with little, if any, insight as to what was seen.",1390608000,4,817,4.8428571428571425
