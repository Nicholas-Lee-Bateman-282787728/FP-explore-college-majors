8313410,5,B001JPC4PE,"Clyde Beatty was always a great little guy with a huge heart and absolutely fearless.  These were days when Animal Trainers
used the whip and blank pistols to keep from being killed in the public performance arena.  Although this is a movie...and Clyde
is doing a acting role......the Animal action is amazing.",1422230400,,310,4.9423076923076925
8313411,5,B001JPC4PE,"Great feature version of the serial of the same name. Starring the late great,mr. circus himself,the worlds GREATEST ever wild animal trainer Clyde Beatty. Those not familiar with Clyde Beatty should watch this film knowing NONE of the scenes with any animal is fake. He was the first man to mix lions and tigers in one cage ! And that was with 20 lions and 20 tigers at the same time. Many a president and kings and queens were fans of Clydes. Although Clyde hobnobed with the elete he was a very approachable down to earth fellow and it shows in his films. This dvd also contains a nice short with Clyde. For circus fans this dvd is a must.",1344297600,,642,4.358333333333333
8313412,5,B001JPC4PE,"Clyde Beatty stars in this wonderful film. He was known as the greatest animal trainer in the world. He does battle with plenty in this. As well you see what is a little disturbing, but as well interesting and that is the fighting of a tiger and a lion. The animal control in this film is amazing. I believe this is a definite must have for any collector.",1226016000,,355,4.235294117647059
