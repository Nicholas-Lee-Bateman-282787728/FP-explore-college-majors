4331492,1,B004D4YE8S,Definitly not even close to the Trinity series Hill and Spencer are well known for.  Suffered through the opening scenes with the super close ups and with the hazy in the dark filming but after that watched another 8-10 minutes and canceled it.,1396051200,,244,4.674418604651163
4331493,1,B004D4YE8S,"I remember when the Trinity series with Terrance Hill came out in the theaters in the early 70s.  I was in Copenhagen at the time (I assume they were in the theaters in the States) and laughed my ass off.  They weren't perfect, and were, after all, spaghetti westerns, but they were fun to watch.  This one, undoubtedly the first attempt that never made it to the big screen may have the elements that might have made it entertaining, but the camera work, lighting and overall film quality (which would be bad even for a home movie) make it virtually impossible to follow.  Too many close ups in very dim lighting.  Its a shame, too, because it looked like a lot of effort went into the costumes and sets (as much as I was able to see).  The follow up movies are great for anyone who likes spaghetti western movies or even comedy.",1395100800,,830,4.392156862745098
4331494,1,B004D4YE8S,"I did not see any indications that this very poor down sampled video was a ""Spaghetti western"" but in the 1st 10 seconds I could tell so I was very disappointed and stopped the playback. Ifyou like Itilian made westerns you might like this movie but the video quality is so poor that I doubt that even hard core  ""Spaghetti western"" fans could stand to watch this poor quality video.",1391558400,,383,4.4714285714285715
4331495,3,B004D4YE8S,Fun old Spanish western with my favorite duo. They just make the best B type westerns ever and they are fun to watch.,1388966400,,117,4.130434782608695
4331496,1,B004D4YE8S,"Very silly acting. It degraded the the story. It does not deserve the time to watch, unless you are very bored and need to get bored more.",1386028800,,138,4.148148148148148
4331497,4,B004D4YE8S,"I love the Trinity movies. While this isn't the same, Terrance Hill is fun to watch. I'll most likely watch it again",1377820800,,116,4.318181818181818
4331498,1,B004D4YE8S,The video quality is as bad as it gets for this Italian western and that's the best thing I can say about this movie.  I will watch any western but I can't think of anything good to say about Boot hill.,1367452800,,202,3.926829268292683
4331499,2,B004D4YE8S,"My wife and I just couldn't get interested in it, I'm probably being harsh when I say it went from a B rated movie to a C rated movie quickly. I stopped watching it and moved on to another movie.",1361836800,,195,3.9
4331500,5,B004D4YE8S,"any western movie is my favorite, this one was great. i even go to web sites that sell clothes from this era.",1361664000,,109,4.0
4331501,4,B004D4YE8S,This is a must have for Terrance Hill and Bud Spencer fans. I had hoped the video quality would have been better but I was disappointed. In my opinion video quality is on par or slightly above VHS but what did I expect from a movie this old? Buy it and add it to your collection today!,1293926400,6,285,4.017543859649122

4331519,1,B004D4YE8S,I watched the first 10 minutes and take was all I could take. I am being generous by giving one star,1402617600,,100,3.8095238095238093
4331520,1,B004D4YE8S,this movie was unwatchable.  the recording was grainy and bad.  Someone should take a look at some of the older movies to be sure you can even watch them.,1401148800,,154,4.275862068965517
4331521,1,B004D4YE8S,"Another bust for actor Hill & Co.  Every since the trilogy of ""my Name is Nobody"", these movie is at abyss.  Though casting US actors, Hill's and 'Bambino's' performance is non-existant.  That coupled with the absolute poor viewing/film condition, made it all too easy to quit watching within 20 min of start.............",1400889600,,321,5.134615384615385
