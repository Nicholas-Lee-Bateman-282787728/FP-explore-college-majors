8544764,1,B009WSBMRQ,"A video camera set up in someones back yard, recording an hour of RAIN. Not storm, just RAIN. Thunder? Once in a while, far off distant. Have to be listening closely or you'll miss it. No accompanying lightning whatsoever.
When I pay for a thunderstorm I went plenty of lightning and loud, loud thunder! If that's what YOU want, don't waste your money on this DVD. It's just RAIN!",1479168000,2,380,4.521739130434782

8544766,4,B009WSBMRQ,I like the heavy rain and thunder on this video.  I would have liked to seen a night shot looking up through a street light catching the rain and lighting along with the sounds of the thunder.,1421366400,,192,4.1891891891891895
8544767,4,B009WSBMRQ,"This video is a one shot recording of a tree, a bird feeder and the side of a house throughout a thunderstorm. So its like  what you would see out of a window. It does loop but I don't know how many times and lasts 1 hour. Not really worth the money but the only one I could find. I think there should be a better representation of thunderstorms out there but I have not found any. There is no lightning and the storm doesn't come closer and then move away as it would naturally.",1383004800,10,479,4.042105263157895
