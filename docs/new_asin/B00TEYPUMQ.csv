7005918,5,B00TEYPUMQ,"""Our Mother's House"" is about seven young London siblings living in a semi-decrepit Victorian house who conspire to hide their religious  mother's death and their efforts to carry on normally.  The normalcy as comprehended by the Hook children would be one prescribed by their fundamentalist mother's beliefs.  Things go relatively well until their fun loving father, Jack (Dirk Bogarde), returns to the fold.  Jack initially agrees to keep the children's secret but it is soon learned that he has an agenda of his own.  There are not enough superlatives to describe how good this film is.  With the exceptions of Pamela Franklin and Mark Lester I had never heard of the young actors playing the Hooks but director Jack Clayton corrals terrific performances from the tykes.  These kids are the heart and soul of the film and they shine individually and as a unit.  Bogarde in his own right is superb engendering a semblance of sympathy for a character that is essentially an unredeemable heel.  The film is unremittingly dark and moody that builds to a crescendo that is genuinely shocking.  This film is relatively obscure but any adventurous cineaste looking for new and intriguing fare ""Our Mother's House"" is a good place to visit.",1433635200,9,1235,4.980487804878049

Haven't had time to watch the dvd itself yet, but am excited to do so, as this appears to be a very rare film that I have never heard of, and even with being such a huge movie fanatic I somehow never heard of this one. But the plot synoposis caught my interest and the reviews are good.",1432166400,4,320,4.095238095238095
7005920,4,B00TEYPUMQ,"Warner Archive brings another forgotten piece of film history back from their dark vaults with Our Mothers House. So many great movies get lost in the shuffle of time and an always crowded box office. They never get the attention they deserve. Some just don't get the proper media coverage or struggle to find the right audience, which I believe was the case when this was originally released in 1967.

In Our Mothers House, Mrs. Hook (Annette Carell) dies after refusing to take medicine owing to her fundamentalist beliefs. She leaves her seven orphaned children to fend for themselves. Not wanting to be put in foster homes, the siblings bury their mother in the garden and successfully keep her death a secret. When their long-lost father (Dirk Bogarde) returns, it's initially a happy reunion, as he helps perpetuate the fraud. But soon he shows his true colors -- drinking, carousing and scheming to sell the house.

What a touching and disturbing film Our Mothers House is. Every single actor onscreen is completely invested in their role. Dirk Bogarde makes you hate the scheming loser he portrays as he lies and mistreats the children. The child actors are incredibly talented and all establish their own individual characters so that the viewer truly empathizes with them.

I would consider Our Mothers House to be a drama with sprinkles of thrills and chills here and there. The scenes of the oldest daughter (Pamela Franklin) trying to contact their dead mother via a sort of sance add a little supernatural flavor to the movie as well. They never really tell you whether shes actually talking to the deceased or faking it to make the children listen to her. Franklin was perfect for the role and continued to freak people out as a clairvoyant in The Legend of Hell House a few years later.

Our Mothers House is manufactured on demand and is only available on DVD. It contains a trailer for the film that runs a little over two and a half minutes long.

Although its unrated, Our Mothers House would garner a PG at the least by today standards. Its a pretty intense film that deals with death and the effects it has on children. The movie contains light profanity, brief adult situations, alcohol and smoking, and some frightening and intense sequences. The part where the mother is lying lifeless in bed with the children surrounding her is one of the most shocking and realistic depictions of death Ive ever seen onscreen.

Our Mothers House is another fine example of a classic film somehow being overlooked by cinema enthusiasts. Its a brilliant family drama blended with just the right amount of effective creepiness to keep you in suspense. The child actors never failed to impress me as they moved from emotion to emotion. Heres hoping that Warner Archives resurrection of the movie garners it some overdue attention.",1428883200,24,2837,4.851239669421488

Warning: This review contains MAJOR SPOILERS.

  Our Mother's House holds a special place in my heart. It tells the story of a group of children struggling to stay together without a parental authority but is about so much more than that. The themes throughout--such as the loss of childhood innocence, the problem of grief, the spirit of unconditional love and forgiveness towards our fellow men and how real life doesn't always provide you a happy ending to tie up all of your dilemmas--are visited in such a complex and thoughtful manner and make this film a richly rewarding experience.

  At one point, Elsa says ""Charlie's not our father. He's mother's husband.""

  ""If he's her husband, he must be our father."" says Jiminee.

  ""It isn't the same thing."" she replies. ""Don't ask my why. It just isn't.""

  So she knew Charlie had left because her mother had cheated on him several times and the littlest ones weren't his; she had most likely seen her mother bring men to the house when she was a little girl. But when the mother turned to God and the Bible for salvation, Elsa found it in her heart to forgive her and loved and cared for her to her dying day.

  When Charlie comes back, at first he tries to love the children but then he allows the grudge he had nursed against his wife to consume him.

  ""I was the one who suffered!"" he cries out at the end. ""I was the one who did all the forgiving and the forgetting when she got all repentant and religious, crying and crawling around my feet! It was ME! I had to get out!""

 I had recently read ""The Great Divorce"" by C. S. Lewis and Charlie's attitude towards his wife reminded me a lot of a character from the book who said he would rather go to Hell than see a murderer go to Heaven 'just because he put up a poor show at the last moment.'

  All of us should ask ourselves from time to time, if we feel this way towards our fellow men. Are we 'jealous because our master is generous?' Never should we turn a repentant sinner away because everyone is valuable to God and there is not a single man who has never fallen.

 Dinah holds sances in the woodshed to commune with the spirit of the mother because she sees the hurt in her younger brothers and sisters' faces and knows they aren't yet ready to let her go. However, as time passes, she cannot hear the mothers voice and makes up the messages as she goes along. Slowly, she begins to realize, these meetings will never bring the mother back nor will they solve the long term problem of grief. Even Charlie--villain, though he is--sees this and takes the furniture back to the house. ""It wasn't good for you, having all those things out there."" he says. ""It was a bad influence."" ""What does it matter, anyway?"" says Dinah. ""We haven't had mother time in ages.""

  Saying goodbye begins the healing because saying goodbye makes it REAL.

 Never have I seen a film with more compelling child performances. There is not a single cute child in the group. Those are real careworn faces and real tears. Sometimes they don't even have to say much--a simple gesture here and there is enough. The close ups of their faces as they take in their mother's death each in their own way. The way Gertie cowers into a corner awaiting her punishment for 'lewdness.' The look on Elsa's face hoping the clerks in the bank won't discover the forged signature on the check. Hubert watching over Gertie's sickbed. Dinah's catatonic state after killing Charlie. All truly unforgettable moments.

  Dirk Bogarde plays the arrogant, hedonistic 'father' Charlie to absolute perfection. It would have been so much easier to portray him as a one-dimensional heel but Bogarde, brilliant actor that he was, manages to add a few traces of humanity here and there (such as the scenes where he tells the children a story about one of his adventures in the world of espionage, plays with them in the backyard, takes them out for a boat ride and apologizes to Dinah about the incident with the whore) to create a more interesting and multi-layered character. His finest moment is the climatic scene where he finally unleashes all the anger and resentment he had accumulated for years and even though Charlie is despicable, I couldn't help but pity him because as he stokes the fire with their mother's picture there are tears in his eyes. I got the feeling, he beat himself up more than anyone else, because he felt that he had failed his wife ""I was the one who tried to keep her straight!"" and asked himself for the rest of his life, why he had never been able to get through to her.

 Our Mother's House appears to be two separate films at times (one with the children fending for themselves and the other with Charlie) yet these two pieces flow so smoothly together you hardly feel the shift due to Jeremy Brooks and Haya Harareet's masterful screenplay which brings the film to a powerful, tragic, ambiguous yet pleasing conclusion.
