7982502,5,B00008G6G4,I am a crime drama nut. Any of that type of movie and I have to buy it. I was not disappointed with the purchase of this movie. Excellent,1373241600,,137,3.7586206896551726
7982503,1,B00008G6G4,"As another reviewer stated... It seems to try to mimic the Choirboys to some degree. There is so much stuff in this movie that it just feels incredibly choppy. There are a multitude of unnecessary scenes and characters. Almost all of them are played badly on top of that. It almost starts feeling like a parody of every cop tv show and movie ever made. It has shades of everything from TJ Hooker to 44 Minutes to Colors. It could work great if thats what the intent was(and they added the comedy part), but I don't think it was. The sex scene in the movie is hilarious, it's almost like the sex scene in Team America.

The music is awful, the script is awful, the acting is awful, the continuity is awful, the technical accuracy to everything from police talking on the radio to the uniforms to the procedural stuff is all AWFUL. But all these elements were not too far from being entertaining. It's really weird. It's all almost there, at least enough to be entertaining. But just falls short in literally every department. Even the awful-ness is almost entertaining, but even that just falls short. It seems like somebody really had high hopes for this movie in the development stages, but just lost control of it. Seems like a movie where there were too many chiefs and not enough indians in the writing and production end of things. Seems like no one involved, all the way to the production crew, was good at their job.

It's an interesting film study though. Its a good example of literally everything going bad that may have possibly been good at the outset.

Just a weird weird movie.",1368576000,,1591,4.555944055944056
7982504,3,B00008G6G4,"I don't get all the hate for this film, it's not great but it's far from terrible, it's got great performances from Marc Singer and the always dependable Michael Madsen(Dennis Hopper was also great, though I wish he had more screentime) some pretty well-done action scenes, (the opening shoot-out hits close to home as there's a Safeway visible in the background, evoking the Tucson shooting spree) the story is a little disjointed though, as criminals seem to pop-up just for the sake of dragging the story out and there are some plot points which are a little confusing(why was the IA guy helping out the dirty cops?)Some characters serve little purpose(why didn't we know more about the two female cops?) Though what I don't get are the complaints about how the film is ""negative"" about the LAPD, considering how many shady things they've done in real life, I really don't see the issue with painting them in a fairly negative light in this film, sadly this story isn't all that unrealistic, it's all too easy for people to get caught up in wanting so much to belong to a group that they'll do anything, regardless of how questionable it may be.",1345420800,,1148,4.7164179104477615
7982505,2,B00008G6G4,"One would think that movie with such an upbeat title would serve as a tribute to the law enforcers.  This movie, however, continues to show the degenerate side of the law, what with more bad cops than you can shake a nightstick at.  This movie is so one-sided though and lamely thrown together it does little more than confirm that there must be an awful lot of dishonest cops out there?  Why doesn't someone make a movie about good cops?  Oh, well, anyway this time around Marc Singer plays a second generation cop who finds himself on the wrong side of the law when he covers up for some of his more illicit buddies.  Even the internal affairs head honcho is on the take.  The bad guys are embodied by Michael Madsen and Wayne Crawford; Dennis Hopper is wasted in a small role as the seemingly dedicated captain; and Charles Durning makes an appearance as Singer's honest cop father.  Steve Bacic rounds out the ensemble as the one true honest cop.  The movie offers nothing new and if I were a member of the LAPD, I'd protest it.",1130112000,,1032,4.452127659574468
7982506,1,B00008G6G4,"From the opening credits, where LAPD police cars race down huge empty straightaway streets I was wondering where they found huge empty streets in LA in broad daylight.  But still, I had high hopes; Dennis Hopper & Michael Madsen -- it's got to be worth watching, there's going to be some seething, twisted intensity somewhere.

  Well, there wasn't...There was, however: cut-and-paste characters, all of them one-dimensional, all of them saying things that seem right out of other movies; a multitude of short, pointless scenes that don't add to the plot; some strange pre-adolescent ideas of how relationships work; and a 'surprise' ending that isn't.
  This is a very amateurishly written and put-together little mishmash.
  The story is: Good guy cop (""Steele"" --just the name gives you some idea of how much thought went into this) in a new, tough division discovers all his new workmates are corrupt. Does he report them to internal affairs? Does he take the money and become one of the gang? Or does he think about it for just long enough to fill out a movie?
 (choose #3...which includes a large number of hasty, moronic talks with his dad, Charles Durning, a retired cop who really shouldn't wear trousers with pleats).
  Dennis Hopper as Captain of the division puts on a worried/angry expression and leaves it there.  Michael Madsen who plays leader of the baddies is so relaxed--no matter what the scene may call for--that he seems to be relieved that he's paying off his credit card bill, or whatever bizarre reason he had to appear in a terrible film like this.

 I think the filmmakers were trying for something like ""The Choirboys"" that had a good amount of comedy and camaraderie to lighten its drama and violence.  Here, though, there's no comedy, the camaraderie is false, the drama is silly, the violence is gratuitous, the characters are laughably simplistically drawn, the plot is old and overused--and with nothing new brought to it.",1082246400,4,1955,4.935779816513762
