1986631,5,B0001CJ8Y6,"As a bluegrass fan, but new to Jimmy Martin, i really appreciated this look at both the man and the music. The director captures a both Jimmy's irrespressible spirit and his music. The behind the scenes music and practice shots are gems. Fans of quirky characters / documentaries will relish the coon hunting, Vernon the goat, and squirrel stew. I just saw the movie in Madison, where, as the bass player in the Nob Hill Boys (who used to be in Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Boys and knows Jimmy) put it, George nailed it.
There are some great DVD extras, too. You'll find plenty of bonus music and media there; they did a nice job of treating the DVD parts almost like an extra CD ROM.
I should mention that George is a friend of mine, but will also mention that Bill C. Malone, author of Country Music, U.S.A. gave the film a glowing review at the Madison show, suggesting that George continue making country music movies, because he gets it. Here's to hoping that George listens. If you like bluegrass, southern culture, or just good documentaries, check this one out.",1083283200,4,1065,4.610526315789474
1986632,5,B0001CJ8Y6,"I really like this DVD, because it gives us a look into the ""life"" of Jimmy Martin, the ""real deal"" behind the sceens; which is something that many of us have not had a chance to view.  We all see the musician on stage, but what about all those crazy wild stories about Jimmy?  Well this is a great DVD to see him as a person, and helps us understand and define him. As a side note:  I like the way this DVD was directed and put together; it is an interesting and easy story to follow that even non-grass-ers will enjoy.  I hope in the future to see more from this ""real deal"" director on bluegrass artists, and may I sugguest the next topic:  Larry Sparks.",1078185600,3,657,4.141732283464567
1986633,5,B0001CJ8Y6,"For any Jimmy Martin fan or bluegrass fan for that matter, this is a movie to own. He's an interesting character and this movie proves it. He reminds me a lot of my late grandfather(my dad's dad).  I was thoroughly impressed with this movie. It was so good to see Jimmy ""in action"". It shows that Jimmy is not just someone who has become a parody of himself or someone else, he's still a bluegrass/country ""artist"" after all these years. I had the privilege of seeing Jimmy at the bean blossom bluegrass festival in 2002, but it was great to see an in depth look at the man behind ""the legend"". I don't think you'll be disappointed with this film. Mr. Goehl worked very hard on it, and it shows. I just hope he can someday make a sequel!!! :-)",1078099200,6,743,4.307142857142857
1986634,3,B0001CJ8Y6,"I love Jimmy Martin - always have.  I wish this DVD would have focused more on his music.  Most of the music that they do play is cut into with dialogue of hunting trips, or Jimmy's negative thoughts of the Grand Ole Opry.  It was interesting to view Jimmy's life, but once I have seen the documentary part, I do not need to view it again - whereas I would love to go back and play the music over and over again.  Maybe he will make a volume 2 showcasing his music.",1077494400,9,465,4.021739130434782
1986635,4,B0001CJ8Y6,"If you love bluegrass and if you want to see one of the true legends of the music at home, on tour and explaining with his heart on his hands why he loves bluegrass so much, RUN AND BUY THIS DVD! This his about true love and respect to the music, about someone who makes some of the best american roots music ever made and deserves worlwide recognition.
This DVD is awesome because its shows respect for Jimmy, shows Jimmy Martin as the outstanding artist he his and it shows the human being. And what human being! Thank you Jimmy!",1074816000,2,531,4.32

8009892,4,B0001CJ8Y6,"This obviously is a good documentary, and I know this to be true because it was incredibly interesting to me despite my being a non-bluegrass fan. Yes, it's got a bit of a low budget feel but its subject, Jimmy Martin [RIP] has more charm and zest than any three persons. He's a walking legend and acknowledged as such by many of his peers, but not by the powers that be at the Grand Ole Opry. His being overlooked seemed to seriously disappoint him yet his vocal qualities and zeal--even as he approached 80--were extremely impressive. Martin sounded as strong as a 20-year-old in some of these neo-yodeling scenes. The guy was astounding. The only negative I'll share is that the director hints, via interviews, that Martin's personality and behavior kept him from being accepted by the country establishment. Unfortunately, no details of his demeanor are shared. All we really see of this unquestionably complex person is intense, kindly, and good-natured behavior. This is a guy who appeared to be loved by all who knew him. He remained a mystery at a deeper level though so that's why I'll only give it four stars.",1204416000,,1119,4.77319587628866
8009893,5,B0001CJ8Y6,"Knew Jimmy in Nashville and had breakfast every morning with him for over a year at Cracker Barrel, I knew the man and he was wonderful, this is a fiting tribute to a man who was a giant and snubbed by the Opry because he didn't fit their profile, warm, friendly, generous and a true King of Bluegrass, highly recommend you have this if you love Bluegrass as I do, he was larger than life and should be remembered for who and what he was.",1123027200,2,438,4.1647058823529415
