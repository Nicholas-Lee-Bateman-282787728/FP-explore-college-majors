7479104,5,B016PCGV36,"I love this collection! I started with Season 1  back a few years ago. I had never done yoga before and had a running injury, but I needed to keep moving. I love movement and used these episodes originally as exercise while my injury healed. Very soon after receiving Season 1, I ordered Season 2. These episodes are more than just movement and the soothing voice of Kate Potter in Season 1 and 2 calm and energize both the body and the mind. When my friends or neighbours came over, if they mentioned they were thinking about trying yoga or wanted to find a yoga class, I'd show them a clip of one from Season 1 or 2 and I'd either lend them one of the discs or direct them to the full episode samples on the Namaste TV website. Three of my friends decided they wanted to get together each week to do an episode or two. So Sunday mornings for over a year, three of us and sometimes 4 or 5 of us got together for an hour or so of yoga using Season1 or 2 with Kate Potter's voice and choreography as our teacher. These episodes also helped me form my own free style yoga for those days when I might not have my computer or want to do yoga but combine different movements from the sessions. Even after 3 years I still use these episodes at least once a week on average. When Season 3 came out, I was skeptical because it wasn't Kate's choreography or voice. I first tried out the sample episode and loved it.  Erica Blitz has put together beautiful sequences and I am loving Season 3. I purchased all three seasons because it's an amazing deal and now I have a full set that I use myself (or with my friends in my home) and I can continue to lend the first 2 Seasons in 4 discs that I can lend out to my friends or neighbours when they say they want to try yoga. Oh, my husband also loved joining me from time to time to do Seasons 1 and 2 yoga episodes. This set of episodes has brought a peace and calm to my life that wasn't there before.",1449446400,13,1939,4.113456464379947

7479108,4,B016PCGV36,"I have been using this series for my daily morning yoga routine for two months after my morning walk. Each disk has six or seven approximately 30 minute routines that consist of a warm up, a flow practice (with either standing or kneeling starts), and a cool down/relaxation segment. The warm-ups are very similar across the series. The cool downs are identical each routine, which allows me to focus on relaxing. The ending relaxation is very short. There are some inspirational quotes and sayings during each routine, but not too much ""new-agey spiritualism"" for those who don't like that.

During the flow segment of each routine, you use a particular breath/body link with Mudras (hand positions) as a way to rest and reconnect motion with breathing. The flow routines build during each segment, adding a new pose (Asana) with each round. I find this format extremely helpful.

I am already familiar with most yoga poses over years of stopping and starting yoga practice various times, so the lack of detailed instruction does not bother me. However, if you are a complete beginner, the lack of instruction may be frustrating. I also suggest that beginners start with season 2, as it is more beginner oriented.

Pros:
Variety of flow routines
Specific balance challenging postures in many routines
Nice production: beautiful settings, gracefully strong model practitioners, soothing music, excellent cues for experienced practitioners
Short and do-able on a daily basis keeps me sticking with it
Repeated use of exercises in warm up and cool down
Flows build with each round
Soothing vocal cues--I like the voices

Cons:
No list of postures used in each segment, and no way to tell ahead of time how difficult a routine will be
Not a lot of formal instruction. Could be off-putting for beginners
Sometimes the camera focuses on a model's face, when seeing the whole body pose would be better
Sometimes at the end of a flow routine, a flow may only be repeated on one side
Relaxation segment seems a bit rushed",1498262400,19,2013,4.946745562130178

7479111,5,B016PCGV36,"The format of these yoga routines is wonderful.  I am not a yoga expert but have been doing basic yoga stretching at home for years.  I find these routines challenging but not impossible.  The moves are broken down and cued for lower intensity so you can grow into the full move with time and practice.  The narrators voice is calming as well as very descriptive.  I find it very easy to follow.  The filming technique is also good, so you can easily follow the moves.  The imaging and settings are calm and relaxing.  The result is a feeling of accomplishment for a yoga routine well done and a calm frame of mind for the day.  I highly recommend this series of DVD's.",1487376000,9,669,4.418032786885246
7479112,3,B016PCGV36,"The Yoga is excellent but I don't like her throaty, whispery voice, I can barely hear her unless I turn the sound way up and then the music is too loud for my taste while doing Yoga....and no I do NOT have hearing issues at all!!",1486512000,3,229,4.0
7479113,2,B016PCGV36,"I was really excited to try this DVD set. The settings were beautiful, and it sounded like it would be great for beginners. However, it moved so fast that unless you are already very experienced,  it is impossible to keep up.  Even the instructions are given so fast that you are unable to keep up with them.  I also agree with the other reviews that the camera shots jump around too quickly.  I'm sending it back. The only reason that I gave it two stars instead of one is because there are a lot of good routines on the DVDs.  They just never give beginners a chance to learn the poses. By the time you figure out how to get into a pose,  they are already three steps ahead of you. What  a shame.",1484352000,11,698,4.164179104477612

7479116,3,B016PCGV36,I thought they would be more stationary with the camera because it was hard to keep up. But after a while you get use to the camera always moving around.,1475884800,3,153,4.133333333333334

7479124,5,B016PCGV36,I used to do Namaste Yoga when it was on Fit TV. I did it while pregnant with my first child. Then Fit TV was cancelled and I tried a few other yoga dvd's but nothing measured up to Namaste. I was so excited to find it on Amazon and the minute I started doing the dvd I felt like I was home again. I LOVE Namaste Yoga and highly recommend it!,1455840000,16,342,3.763888888888889

8736997,5,B016PCGV36,"Best yoga series I've found to date.  The overall setting and music helps calm and relax, while the workouts are still challenging.  The narrator's voice is very soothing.  Absolutely worthwhile and enjoyable.  Highly recommended!!!",1528675200,,232,5.735294117647059

8737000,4,B016PCGV36,"Great short building flows. They are about 20 mins each including warm up and cool down so probably only 15 mins of actual flow. I subtracted one star because they call poses by different names then the general yoga population which makes it difficult to follow if you've done yoga before. There are very easy flows and some more challenging ones. I have only done season 1 &2 so far so I will update after I've been through season 3. You should also know that these flows are not upbeat yoga but more internal and reserved so if your looking for an endorphin rush workout you should look elsewhere. Otherwise I love it for what it is and is perfect for where I am currently in my practice. In sum, its the spa like yoga experience in the comfort of your own home.",1521936000,,764,4.34965034965035
8737001,5,B016PCGV36,I love these yoga dvds! The voiceover and poses are excellent! I had watched this on Fit tv years ago and Im glad to have it in my home (without commercials). The best yoga DVDs I own!,1521590400,,184,4.0

8737003,5,B016PCGV36,"This series is way too good to not be available for digital purchase on Amazon video or included with prime video  streaming is my preferred method with this sort of media because I know exactly where I left off. Anyways, I love this series and have been doing them since 2006 through fittv but no longer have cable... Will have to save up to get this vs episode by episode or season by season digitally.... This is the best yoga video workout series out there, my absolute favorite. ",1516492800,,484,4.488636363636363
8737004,5,B016PCGV36,"I'm a huge fan of this Yoga series! I was first introduced to it on Z-Living TV but got tired of the commercials so I decided to purchase this set. I love the pace of the movements and I find the instructors' voices quite soothing and relaxing. The scenery is beautiful but honestly once you get into the swing of the instructors' verbal cues, you can do these without watching on the screen. The warm up and cool down sections of the episodes have a lot of similar movements so it's easy to follow once you've done a few. I'm loving the improvement in my balance and I don't find the program to be overly strenuous.",1509580800,2,616,4.318965517241379
