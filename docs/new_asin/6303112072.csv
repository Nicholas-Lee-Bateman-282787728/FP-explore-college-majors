568908,3,6303112072,I saw this movie YEARS ago on cable when cable first came to my town. It always scared me and I wanted to see it as an adult. Other reviews said it was bad and really it is but it was still fun to see it after all this time. It has a decent story line but just looses something in the translation.,1389139200,,297,3.7301587301587302

568910,4,6303112072,"Yes, the digital quality is lacking because of the source or age, but it's a great film.  Highly atmospheric and moody with fantastic lighting and one of the most twisted plots.  Great film from this time period. Amazon Prime is fantastic and seems to be getting better with more obscure free movies like this one.",1376697600,,314,4.6909090909090905

When I came across this ""Dominique"" with Jean Simmons and Cliff Robertson (both of whom, in my opinion are at the top of their game as actors), I decided to watch it right then.  This movie had me on the edge of my seat trying to figure things out until the very end.  What a great find, I'm looking forward to watching it again in a couple of years.

568913,4,6303112072,"We rented this film on a DVD of three old, scary movies. One was a classic ultra-low-budget that I already knew, 'Carnival of Souls', but I had never heard of the other two, and I wasn't expecting much. 'Dominique' exceeded my expectations. This film is well-acted, with very effective visuals done without special effects, and I found it enjoyably creepy with a number of really scary moments.

Veteran actress Jean Simmons in the title role is moving as the disabled, despairing, but still dignified wife of a husband she has come to mistrust. Her later appearances (the word is related to 'apparition') are well-staged and frightening, with no aspect scarier than her expression, inhumanly passive yet somehow determined toward some unuttered goal.

The house is not your customary scary-movie Gothic mansion, but is more of an expansive Italian villa, and the visuals of its wide-open, columned interior spaces gave me an unsettling sense of my own exposure. The camera work is creative and often beautiful: Note the very last scene. Music is used sparingly, its tasteful absence heightening the sense of aloneness as a frightened Mr. Ballard wanders the darkened house. I found many things to like in this obscure B-grade film.

Just a note: Jean Simmons and Flora Robson had appeared together thirty years earlier in the Archers' classic, 'Black Narcissus'.",1162339200,5,1363,5.13063063063063

1. Some elements in this story can definitly occur in  the real life. just watch it till the end, and you'll  understand why i say it.
2. Everything in this film is calculated to the last  detail, and the actors give the audience a very good  and realistic play.
If you won't see this film i'll tell you just this: YOU WON'T EVER KNOW WHAT IS FEAR AFTER A GOOD THRILLER !
  Prepare a big pot with popcorn before this one :)",970272000,15,687,3.9926470588235294

If you get the chance to watch it, don't hesitate, it's not a milestone but it is well worth seeing  it.

569004,1,6303112072,A horrible pointless story that makes you glad you're not rich and you don't live in a rich person's mausoleum.  There are probably  a lot more murders than anyone knows.  This is a story about horrible predatory people who care nothing for anything but money and things..  Jean Simmons is  always a great actress but that isn't enough to make this story palatable.  The film quality of this era of color movies is pretty fuzzy and distracting.l,1445990400,,445,4.714285714285714

There isn't a lot of rollicking action here. It's all slow and atmospheric, but if you're in that kind of mood, it will suit you just fine. It's not a high-quality transfer, and that was a bit disappointing. However, I did love that feeling of being drawn into a wonderful, stylish, British mystery with a hint of ghosts, ""Gaslight,"" murder and betrayal!",1501113600,,526,4.43298969072165
7838655,2,6303112072,"Review of Dominique
Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

Dominique started off as a very interesting pseudo-thriller. Jean Simmons plays the title role, a woman who, in the beginning scenes, is being gaslighted by her husband, Cliff Robertson. Since shes naturally sweet and unassuming, and hes naturally unlikable, the beginning was very fun to watch. As it dragged on, the film became more of a cheap thriller than anything else. Jean is so tormented by her husbands tricks, she hangs herself, then comes back as a ghost to haunt him. Im not spoiling anything; if you look the movie up online, that will be in the one sentence plot description.

It isn't particularly scary, gimmick-y, mysterious, or interesting. There are so many other ghost stories and thrillers you can choose from, and I suggest you do so.",1500940800,,807,4.883211678832117

David and Dominique are a wealthy couple living in England.  Dominique suffers from depression and takes her own life.
