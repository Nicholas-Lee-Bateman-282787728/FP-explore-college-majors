901403,5,6304612982,"While this movie starts out as a well-intentioned inspirational piece, it quickly becomes an hilarious expose of an extremely talented runner intent on proving himself to the world.  Anyone who understands the comedic value  of Ben Stiller in the movie ""Heavyweights"" (remember the insane  camp owner?) will love this movie for the same reason.  With lines like  ""You're too small Steve, you're not fast enough Pre, give up your  foolish dreams, Steve"" it is hard not to take a lighter look at this  drama that becomes so much more.  The message is good but it is extremely  amusing as well.",911779200,,591,4.83
901404,4,6304612982,"In the tradition of sports-themed films such as Hoosiers, Rudy & even Rocky, this tale of an unlikely sports hero belongs in the collection of any self-respecting athlete.  Details the life of ""mythologized"" runner Steve Prefontaine from his humble beginnings in an isolated Oregon town to his Olympic debut, his crusade for the rights of U.S. athletes and untimely death.  Leto captures the ego, work-ethic and inspirational fire that makes Prefontaine an idol to so many runners even today, almost 25 years after his death.  END",900028800,,530,5.1395348837209305

901540,1,6304612982,"This movie is fantastic, but I am writing a 1-star review because of the quality of the Blu Ray.  It literally appears that someone played the DVD and recorded it with a handheld camcorder to translate it to a Blu Ray disc.  The quality is the worst I have ever seen on a Blu Ray disc.  The screen just bounces randomly the whole time, thought I was going to be nauseated.  Don't waste money on a blu ray, pick up an old DVD version instead.",1476921600,,441,4.152941176470589

901610,1,6304612982,"Just received this ""Prefontaine"" Blu-ray, a new BR release hot off the presses, and unfortunately, it is of very poor quality. Quite typical for a Mill Creek release.  Basically, the picture is in soft focus, even though we are paying our money for high-definition. This is not only far from high-definition, it is actually inferior in sharpness to the DVD, which I compared it to on my 60-inch Samsung high-definition TV.  Yes, the DVD is noticeably sharper.

There are absolutely no extras on this Blu-ray, not even a chapter menu to go to, much less subtitles or anything else . Don't even think about seeing a trailer or a documentary about the making of the movie. What is kind of shocking is that there are only five chapters, despite the fact that the movie is over 1:46.  And the fifth chapter takes you to the end of the credits, actually past the end of the disc, so there are actually only four chapters, one of the remaining ones being at the opening of the picture. Speaking of the movie's opening, viewers will notice the soft focus immediately in the studio's logo and the words printed under it. As well as in the opening scenes. Again, the entire movie is in softer focus on this Blu-ray than it is on the DVD.

Is anything better on the Blu-ray?  Well, it is in full 16 x 9, anamorphic, whereas the DVD is letterbox, with black bars above and below the picture.

Amazon really shouldn't carry the kind of junk that Mill Creek and a couple of the other studios sell, which they have the nerve to call Blu-rays. A Blu-ray by definition should be in high-definition, and that means, again by definition, that it would have better picture quality than a DVD, not worse.

This is one of the five worst Blu-rays I've ever bought, and at this point, I own over 300, for movies going back to the 1930s. This late-1990s movie should be a lot sharper, but it is simply soft. (It is not unviewable, jittery, or full of dirt or artifacts, but, you could say the same thing about the DVD, which has a superior picture in all respects.) The running times are virtually identical; the Blu-ray runs a mere six seconds longer. I must say, I would return this if it was worth the time and energy, but I only spent $6.99 + tax.

For anybody who is interested in the best picture quality, buy the DVD, not this poor Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is really an embarrassment once you look at the DVD and compare. There's absolutely nothing high-definition about this, and in every way, they make it clear that this thing was done on the cheap, and really, by people who don't know what they're doing.

I have never heard of a movie which is close to two hours long that has only five chapters. In contrast, the DVD has a dozen chapters.

Oh yes, this movie was made the same year as another movie about Steve Prefontaine, ""Without Limits."" Without Limits is a far superior movie in all respects, from the acting, to the script, to the historical accuracy, although there is no Blu-ray for Without Limits to compare the Blu-ray picture quality to.

Don't say I didn't warn you.",1460160000,2,3063,4.509025270758123

901789,4,6304612982,"I prefer Without Limits but Prefontaine is pretty good. This one has more the slant from Bill Dellinger and Bowerman is played with a harder edge by R. Lee Ermey. This is the Disney production and  mild on Pre's extracurricular activities in contrast to Limits and may be more accurate, particular in reference to the lacerated foot before the NCAA championships. Like a previous reviewer, I always heard he lacerated his foot in a swimming accident. The race scenes are quite good and the Munich scenes somewhat better than Limits with more emphasis. You really cannot go wrong with watching both, there is a significant contrast but both have that Pre fire.",1404259200,6,659,4.883928571428571

Admittedly, I pretty much only watched it for Jared Leto, but I thought that it was a great inspirational movie that really delved into the life Steve Prefontaine.

901847,5,6304612982,"Like this version much more than Without Limits.  I think this version is more historically accurate and less dramatized by Hollywood.  For example, includes the entire Munich experience which Without Limits hardly touched upon.  Of course, who knows what is the real truth unless you were there or have really studied the facts, but his foot injury, from what I have heard, was indeed from a swimming related (vs sex related) injury.  I found that scene in Without Limits just ludicrous.  My vote is for Prefontaine and it is a very inspirational story regardless if you yourself are a runner.",1397520000,,594,4.9

I also had no problem with what's been described as the ""pseudo-documentary"" approach, I thought it was used a minimal way that enhanced the story and kept it from going down too many long roads to develop the character indirectly.  .  Jared Leto did a great acting job as Prefontaine, just didn't quite look the part.

901947,4,6304612982,"I've seen this film a couple of times, and I've also seen ""Without Limits"" a couple of times as well.  While I'm giving this film a 4, that 4 is with some severe caveats, as that other finer film has shown how good a sport movie about running can be.  In reality, I believe that ""Prefontaine"" is really a 3.5.

I hated the way that this film started as a pseudo-documentary.  I think that that was a huge tactical mistake, probably like taking the lead with four laps left in the 5000.  While I'm not much of a runner, it appears that Steve Prefonaine perhaps made this mistake himself at the 1972 Olympics, and I needed a nice little simile, so that one seemed to work.

But once you sprint past the first act, the director seemed to run away from this documentary feel and I think that was a good idea.  From what I remember, ""Without Limits"" didn't concentrate as much on the tragedy of the Olympics in Germany, and that was probably a smart move as well.  While those Olympics were surely important from at least an historical perspective, I'm not exactly convinced that what happened there -- at least to the Israelis -- was as important to Mr. Prefontaine as this film seemed to portray.  But naturally, I could be wrong there; probably only his friends really know.

For me, I think that the biggest difference between the two films was the head coach role.  While I've always been a fan of R. Lee Ermey -- and I thought that he did a good job here -- I just liked Donald Sutherland's portrayal better in ""Without Limits.""  Mr. Sutherland just seemed more natural, more laid back and philosophical to me, kind of like a Phil Jackson type.

Still, a pretty good film, especially if you are a Prefontaine fan.  (I'm only a minor fan myself.)  My recommendation though:  watch this one first, and then catch ""Without Limits.""  That way you won't nitpick as much when watching this lesser film, and will be saving the best for the last lap.",1380672000,,1943,4.474431818181818

I cannot personally comprehend the 'Desire' that coaches love to work with but this film helped fill in a few pieces, the whole concept of ownership, is this a common belief among atheletes???

902153,3,6304612982,"""Prefontaine"" is a 1997 film bio of long distance runner Steve Prefontaine who competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics. It stars Jared Leto with Ed O'Neill and R. Lee Ermey as his coaches and Breckin Meyer and Amy Locane as his girlfriend. Brian McGovern plays a disc thrower

Jared Leto (1971) is terrific. He can be arrogant and timid, exploitative and submissive, and gives a well rounded picture of who the person was. This was his first starring role.

Ed O'Neill (1946) made us laugh for 11 seasons as Al Bundy on ""Married...with Children"" (1987-97), and subsequently landed another hit comedy series with ""Modern Family"" (2009-11). His film career has not done so well, although he has been busy with a film every few years. His last film was a brief appearance in one of the best martial arts films ever - ""Redbelt"" (2008) - in which he played a Hollywood producer for a Brazilian jiu Jitsu (O'Neill holds a black belt).

R. Lee Ermey (1944) is everyone's favorite Marine drill instructor, a role he played in real life as well as in films (""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Boys in Company C"", ""Toy Story""). He plays Bill Bowerman, Prefontaine's coach and the man who co-founded Nike. Ermey does a nice job in toning down his bluster and presenting Bowerman as three dimensional character.

Director Steve James made his mark with the Oscar nominated ""Hoop Dreams"" (1994) earning himself the shot at this film. This was his only full length feature film. He continues making documentaries, and won a DGA award for his work on ""At the Death House Door"" (2008).

Bio pics about celebrities who die young (e.g., ""James Dean"", ""Man in the Moon"", ""Brian's Song"") have inherent problems - we know what's going to happen and the ending is inevitably a bummer.

This film chooses to use a flashback device in which the story is told primarily from the POV of O'Neill, McGovern, Meyer, and Locane, his assistant coach, a fellow athlete (disc thrower),  and his girlfriends. It provides a complete story of Prefontaine's life, including the time before going to college, his college years, the athletic events, the Olympics, and his subsequent fight for athlete rights. It has a documentary feel, but looks enough like as film to avoid being called a documentary.

I really enjoyed the music to this film, and the photography is great. Costumes help give this a 70s look. There are just enough running sequences to qualify as a sports film, but the story manages to focus on the person. It's definitely enjoyable and nice to see a film that focuses on a sport which is rarely covered., although if I had to pick my favorite ""running"" films I'd have to choose ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981) and ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" (1962) with ""Personal Best"" (1982).",1301961600,,2753,4.793248945147679

You'll lace up the running shoes after this film.  The script was generous to all the supporting people who nurture greatness in the form of Steve Prefontaine. Special mention should go to the casting and artistic control of this looking back upon the start of the jogging era. Jared Leto plays Prefontaine like a glove, at first running on brashness to finish on unselfish awareness. Certainly, there are parallels to James Dean here, but when actual Munich footage enters effectively, Leto's portrayal ascends with the laurels Prefontaine earned. Next to ""Jim Thorpe--All Merican"" in inspiration, ""Prefontaine"" uplifts with its sad ending, while ""Thorpe"" falls away despairingly. When you watch this film unfold as much about a gifted athlete as a giving one, and you reflect upon the selfish ones today, you will want to learn more about this comet who blazed once brightly.

902161,4,6304612982,"This is a good film. It entertains totally. Jared Leto does a splendid job of maintaining the center of attention for almost the entire film. This is a sign of a considerable actor to hold our attention for two full hours as the figure almost always on screen.

It is an inspirational film but also a cautionary one. I say this because Prefontaine's ambitions and self assurance seem adolescent at first. Like many young high school seniors, he knows everything and no one can tell him anything. He just happens to be one of the most talented and determined high school seniors in the nation. The film takes Prefontaine through a series of events that begin to teach him his personal limits, his priorities, his commitment to others, and finally that he must adjust to events larger than himself.  In a sentence, this film is about an extremely self-motivated and self-centered talented young man who becomes a better person as he adjusts to the hard knocks that come to all of us in life. The major hard knocks for Prefontaine are the terrible events in Munich and his performance which disappointed him. IN many ways this is the best part of the film for we get to see the terror of the events in Munich and we get to see Prefontaine's reactions to those events.

Jared Leto goes a good job playing this young man. I wish he had been able to reap the rewards of maturity.",1211846400,2,1373,4.550607287449393

902327,4,6304612982,"Steve Prefontaine, a record setting middle distance runner, won all his races against Americans.  He led his race in the 1972 Olympics but faded to fourth by a breath.  He died in a car accident (drinking was involved, but to what degree is debated) in 1975 at the age of 24.  All admit that he wasn't the perfect physical specimen for a runner, but he was gritty and tenacious and would not give anything less than everything he had.

You would think it would be hard to come up with a full length bio pic about someone who died at 24.  Yet, in 1998 there were TWO films that came out about his life.  One from Disney and the other from Warner Brothers.

The Disney Film tells the story from the point of view of the assistant coach who was with him day-to-day, Bill Dellinger and Prefontaine's girlfriend at the time of his death, Nancy Alleman.  It has a good cast with Jared Leto as Prefontaine, Ed O'Neil as Bill Dellinger and R. Lee Ermy as Bill Bowerman.  Siskel and Ebert reviewed it and gave it two thumbs up.

The Warner Brothers release was produced by Tom Cruise and told from the point of view of Bill Bowerman with Dellinger as a minor character and Mary Marckx.  In this film there is no Nancy Alleman and Mary is his girlfriend all the way through.  Bowerman is played by Donald Sutherland and is given guru status.  In both films, Prefontaine is shown as headstrong and difficult to coach.  Bowerman did remain active with the Oregon program and with Prefontaine after his retirement.

In both films, Prefontaine is shown as a powerful and hard charging runner who also loved to party too much and had troubled relationships with his young women.  The fans love him and his fame is correctly portrayed as is his loss at the '72 Olympics.

Since the accident occurred while Prefontaine was alone in the car no one can be certain how it happened.  Both films have him swerving from a second car, but the Warner film shows the rock face that the car climbed and caused it to flip on top of the runner and crushing him.  He was alive when first found, but the person could not flip the car alone and by the time they got back he was gone.

Prefontaine continues to inspire young runners and people who believe that testing your limits and giving all you have is important to living and understanding your life.  That these tests are a kind of art that you create for yourself and are a kind of honesty that few actually experience (even though it is open to all).

Both movies are good, and you have to decide if seeing two films about such a short life is needed, but there is certainly much worse fare shown every night on TV and at your local movie house.",1156118400,72,2671,4.408163265306122

Steve Prefontaine, also known as ""Pre,"" is one of the most notorious names when it comes to the history of running and the Munich Olympics.  This movie is great for those who are looking for a career in running.  As a current member of the track team my in high school, I am truly inspired by this story.

 Prefontaine shows the passion of someone who truly goes through ""hell and back"" to achieve his goals.  Always seen as the underdog throughout his running career, Pre truly proved himself to be a legend when fighting his way to the top.  He was known to be cocky, but established himself when it came time to step on the track.

  ""Go Pre!"" is what the crowds chanted as he ran and when he would come down the homestretch of the track.  He ran every race as if it were his last and was a man who was fire on the track.  Sadly, his career was cut short when he died in a tragic car accident at the age of 24.

 This movie will forever motivate me during life.  This is a wonderful and inspirational movie.  I truly believe that Pre is one of the best runners to have ever existed.  Pre put running and track on the map for America and because of that he will forever be remembered for it.

  ""To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the Gift,"" is the quote Pre told kids when they asked him about running.  Because of his story, Prefontaine, this movie, and quote have allowed me to become a better runner and have allowed to believe that I can achieve any goal I want.  This movie is a must-have for anyone who has a passion for running or might need a boost of inspiration, and always remember, Go Pre!",1133395200,2,1673,4.211356466876971

Cheesy lines fill the scenes in this movie along with Melrose Place esque acting. The script depicts steve prefontaine as an insecure, scared little kid, when he was the exact opposite. Jared Leto does a good job looking like pre but not much else. The running portion of the movie is based more on the easiest shot than on an actual race. Since when did long distance runners run in the middle of the track anyway? I am not denying that the story is one of the best out there but if thats what you're looking for, Without Limits, the other movie about prefontaine far surpasses this movie. Better acting, better script, no interrupting interviews with the actors posing as steves friends and family, and it was actually shot in eugene rather than somewhere in washington.

Fortunately, I fall into the first category so I was engrossed with the story of the famed runner Prefontaine.  The story improved considerably in the second half, when archival footage and the dramatic events of the Munich Olympic games unfolded.

Jared Leto does a good job, even with all those wigs and spirit gum.  Amy Locane seems to be phoning in her performance from a parallel ""Melrose Place"" universe.

The main cast, Jared Leto and R. Lee Ermey as the unforgettable Bill Bowerman, are really quite good for a film of this budget.  ""Prefontaine"" follows Pre's story more closely than ""Without Limits"" and definitely offers more for runners to sink their teeth into.
Admittedly, the film's appeal is probably limited to those who are truly interested or inspired by the sport of running (or know someone who is).

902390,1,6304612982,"I recently caught this on HBO and was dissapointed by what could of been.  The story of distance runner Steve seems like it could of been interesting since a character study based on a long distance runner captures on of sports most exciting events.
This movie falls into the classic problematic sport movie dichotomy...ok sport scenes and horrible everything else.  The races in Munich is the one real exciting scene in the movie.  You feel like you are there and the movie does a good job at getting into the little known strategy behind long distance running.
The problem with this movie is that it fails everywhere else.  The main character is doubly flawed- the actual charater is a problem as is the actor who portrays him.  Steve Prefontaine is a self centered prick who is cold and distant.  Besides this he is also completely one dimensional and most of the dialogue is cliched and boring.  We get no insight into why he is such a great runner and all the non-sport scenes center on his shallow boring relationships or where he is going to proove himself next but nothing about what makes him tick.  I quickly grew tired of Pre's continuing attempts to further himself in the sport becuase I cared little for his personal achievements since I didn't care for him.  At the end when he turns down the big bucks for his dreams or racing the Finns we are supposed to feel empathy for him when his arch rival cancels, but by this time I was too bored to care.  If you want to watch an uniteresting diluded ass for 2 hours than this is the movie for you.
The other problem dooming this movie is the poor cast.  Jared Leto is a no talent hack who has no buisness attempting a leading role of this magnitude.  Again he fails magnificently as his one tone delivery of dialogue is reminiscent of a bad high school theater production.  He was awfull in My So Called Life, he stank in Requiem For a Dream and he somehow managed to be even worse in this (although his ""performance"" in Panic Room might take the cake)  He has that ""Im not that quite there"" look in every movie and it drives me crazy.  The rest of the cast is misplaced but tries their best.  Amy Locane is underused and their relationship is so underdeveloped that it just takes up time in the movie for no purpose.  The great Ed Oneil is misused here in a cliched performance.  Lee Emery has parlayed a one role oddity of amazmement (Full Metal Jacket) into a movie career that shouldn't have been.
Bottom Line:  By the end of this movie I found myself laughing at it out loud- not something you want to be doing with a serious biopic that is trying to take itself seriously.  ""Go Pre, Go Pre"" - gimme a break.",1064534400,4,2673,4.427402862985685
902391,4,6304612982,"It's been a few years since I first saw 'Prefontaine'. I'd seen it several times and I finally saw 'Without Limits' tonight.
Prefontaine:
Acting
I thought the acting in this movie could have been much better. The principle actors were decent, but it was a long drop off to the secondaries as far as acting talent. I felt Leto was more brash, cocky and arrogant. In comparison to Crudup, it made me feel Pre was this way on many occasions more out of fear or a need to be arrogant, as opposed to true belief in himself. More like a prima donna.
Facts
Given that these are movies and not documentaries, I really don't care about the small ones such as how close a race was, etc. But would like to get the truth on the the bigger issues such as personal relationships, how he hurt his foot (there either were witnesses, or there were not), and how directly he was involved in the fight against the AAU. I liked the added details in Munich and his life after Munich, showing his continued successes. These details were great from an informational perspective, but it certainly made the direction seem choppy. Without input from Pre himself, so many aspects of his friendship and love life are skewed by the perspective of the person that is recounting it, and can be questioned in both movies. To observe it is to change it, as they say. I would certainly say if you asked for the story of my uneventful life from 2 different ex-girlfriends, you would probably get 2 completely different stories.
Racing
This movie seemed a little shallow in this area. It seemed like all it did to teach the audience about strategy and Pre's abilities was to say, ""You are too slow to sprint, so you have to push the pace faster to make the kickers tired"". Maybe that is as much detail as the common viewer wants, but I would have liked to have seen more. I thought the race sequences in both films were good.
The interviews mixed with tradional story telling might have worked better if the casting had been better. Production quality was not as good as WL.
Without Limits -
Acting
By FAR the superior movie. Crudup and Sutherland's relationship just felt so much more real. And a million times more mature. You have to question authenticity of course, but their philosophical conflicts truly drive this movie and make the overall product much more mature.
Facts
This is not meant to be a documentary, and I can understand having to summarize 3-4 events into 1 event to make an accurate point - whether you are talking about Pre's love life or his races - for the sake of drama or time. I still would have liked to seen at least a few minutes talking about Pre's races after Munich instead of leaving the new viewer to thinking that he only ran 1 meet after Munich, and he died later that night. To me this was a weakness in the film. It left a lot of places where you have to fill in the blanks - such as Bowerman's appointment as Olympic coach, the Pre graduated and was no longer a student, etc. Now that I've seen both films and have a stronger grip on the true facts, skipping these details aren't as big of a deal as they are merely background to what is happening to Pre - as long as you are already aware of them.
Racing
In addition to focusing on Pre's relationships, it spent more time on race strategy, introducing other athletes than just Viren, and seemed to engage the sport at a deeper level. As a former competitor, this interested me quite a bit. Prefontaince had more race sequences, but I thought the sound effects in WL were great to create the feel of the race. The tension felt of running in the pack was expertly done, and the acting of Crudup in these sequences was good. I would have liked to see a little more pain on their faces and a little less closed-mouth running. WL did a better job at showing exactly how fast a 63 second quarter is.
This movie went out of its way to focus on Pre, Mary, and Bowerman's relationships. This just felt more authentic and mature. I think it is a shame they had to sum up so many of Pre's races - before and after the Olympics - but this was a conscious decision made to embrace Pre's story by showing fewer of his races - which can be felt as redundant in this medium, and humanizing him more. Prefontaine did a great job showing Pre's drive and heart, but I thought WL was more rewarding by showing his struggles with himself and those close to him - which surely must have existed.
While both movies showed some sides of Pre that aren't always listed as 'good' characteristics, only in WL did it truly feel like reality. The dialogue in Prefontaine certainly felt more like a Disney movie and combined with delivery, it was all a little contrived.
Once again, I felt that Without Limits was more the thinking-man's version of the movie, while Prefontaine did an excellent job with the facts of Pre's racing career and had an emotionally high value throughout the movie. Both raw emotion and embracing a new philosophy can inspire someone, and they both succeed at this. I would probably choose Prefontaine to show to people that do not know Pre's story, but for my own viewing, I would probably watch Without Limits repeatedly to get to the heart of the human story and struggles with philosophy, passion, and desire.",1063497600,5,5264,4.478668054110302
902392,5,6304612982,"Not having seen the other films on Steve Prefontaine's life, I can't make a comparison between them. But I can say that this film convinces me that A.E. Houseman's poem, ""To An Athlete Dying Young"" was written for phenomenal athletes such as Steve Prefontaine.
 Jared Leto gives a straightforward and sensitive performance as the daring young athlete. He seems to be in a hurry to experience all of life's processes, and at the same time, he is a very likeable and down-to-earth guy to whom everyone can relate. We come to appreciate his youthful idealism, especially in the face of tragedy at the Games in Munich, and the substantial contributions that he makes to sport.
 My first introduction to R. Lee Ermey was as the hilariously bombastic drill sargent on The History Channel's show, ""Mail Call"". While the accuracy of his portrayal of Coach and Nike entrepreneur, Bill Bowerman as a Redneck is questionable, I gradually came to accept him as a fine choice to play Pre's mentor. It was also nice to see Ed O'Neill in a serious role as Bill Dellinger.
 A viewer comes to feel how loved and supported Pre was when observing the portrayal of those closest to the ill-fated runner.
 Lindsay Crouse and Peter Anthony Jacobs are his generous and supportive parents, Laurel Holliman's Elaine Finley is his calm and intelligent-looking first girlfriend; The always sweetly-impish-faced Amy Locane portrays his second girlfriend, track runner Nancy Alleman.
 It's interesting to see them reminiscing about Pre about 20 years after the story ends. The make-up jobs that add two decades to the actors' appearances is detectable, but reasonable.
 Young Robert Carl Burke introduces us to Pre's athletic and determined spirit as a child, Brecken Meyer, as Pat Tyson gives a cheerful sense of camaraderie to the film as Pre's friend and fellow runner.
 The tragic sense of loss in Munich is profound. But the Great Athlete rallies, and works to improve the conditions of Amateur athletes as he continues to dazzle the crowds with his speed and grace on the track.
 His end is graphically reenacted. But we are left with a sense that maybe he did all that he was meant to do with his life, as unfair as life itself can sometimes be. Bill Dellinger feels convinced that Pre may have triumphed at the Summer Olympics at Montreal in 1976. But it doesn't seem right to speculate about such a thing. We have to feel that Somehwere, Pre is running The Perfect Race where the Gold will never again be elusive.
 I was too little to appreciate all this man meant to the world of sports when he was alive. But I have learned.
 The final tribute to Pre in the Stadium where he ran is solemn, but stirring, with fans shouting ""Go, Pre!"" just as he would have wanted. It is a moving moment of life, rememberance, and hope despite a great loss.",1052179200,5,2821,4.750511247443763

902434,5,6304612982,"This is an excellent movie about possibly the greatest long-distance track runner in American history. Steve ""Pre""fontaine held every American record from the 2,000 metre and the 10,000 metre, a feat which has never been touched by another runner. In argument to other reviews, Pre was considered a front runner, but he was not a front runner to the extent that Bedford of England or another runner was. Pre knew what he had to do to win, and that was what he did. Bill Bowerman was indeed played as a crazy redneck, one part of the movie which I did not like, but he did express some knowlege of the sport as he talked at the Olympics and the Trials. Pre's girlfried did, actually, run the 5,000 for the Lady Oregon track team. Now, if you watch the credits at the end of the movie, it says that the ATU was a fictional association, and had never even existed. Pre's final race was against the Finns at Hayward Field, and it was not a close race, as considering that he won the race ahead of the pack by a good twenty yards, and beat Shorter by about ten.
Now, on to the actual review. It is an excellent movie about Steve Prefontaine. Jared Leto plays Pre with such emotion, that he seems to reach out and touch the viewer. He does an excelent job of telling the audience that Pre did not have the physique of an athlete, but he trained, and practiced, and had the determination to go against the odds and win. The film contains several clips of him running in real life, a great way of showing the viewer how he really ran.
This film is a must have for the aspiring runner. I also recommend the soudtrack, which contains music to make one want to get up off the couch and go run. Thumbs Up!",1041465600,2,1693,4.310344827586207
902435,5,6304612982,"This movie is great for those interested in running as a competitive sport. My prime running years developed during Prefontaine's peak years, so I was one of those keenly aware of his abilities and influence. I was sad to hear of his untimely death. This movie helped remind me of that time period and how much of an impact he had on long-distance running. It was also good to see Frank  Shorter in the movie (another giant from that time).
The actors were good and the cameos by actual characters were really good. The running was realistic and fast-paced. Even some of the true cross-country scenery was included, which is not often seen these days.
The movie keeps flowing, which might have been hard for a topic that is usually laid-back. I was glad that the movie focused on the topic and did not fall for the typical Hollywood glitz that tries to cover up reality. The emotionality (the triumph and the defeat made popular by ABC at that time) is brought into new light for viewers who may have considered running a dull sport.

Jared Leto did a phenominal job of playing Prefontaine.  He looked and played the part of a world class runner.  R. Lee Ermey complimented him nicely as his track coach, Bill Bowerman, who later founded Nike.  Ermey's timing was excellent, and his character was very well-rounded on the screen.  Craig T.

I like the fact that they kept on the straight and narrow; not delving too much into the realm of historical details which can hopelessly clutter the script. Instead what you get is a feel for the time, a feel for who Bowerman and Dellinger was. This was the era of Vietnam, of demonstrations, and you can hear it and smell it and think it.

Such fascination  led to 2 movies chronicling the life of Steve Prefontaine  were mad ein the  1990's.
For first release, the battle of the PRE-bioflicks was won by  this movie, and its release and luke warm reception shelved the Robert  Towne-directed `Without Limits' for more than a year.
Perhaps this story  would have been better served as a Made-for-HBO film, where one-name titles  like ""Prefontaine"" give stars like Matt Damon a chance for some good work,  and media recognition.

902560,3,6304612982,"I give this movie three stars for general moviegoers, most of whom did not bother to see either this version or ""Without Limits"" the first time in theaters -- probably for reasons sufficient to them.
People who  run long distance, who love Steve Prefontaine and/or what he stood for, are  throwing stars at both of these movies for those reasons, I suspect, not  for the movies as artworks. Since I  attended Prefontaine's high school a  number of years later, I met him my first week of school, I ran long  distance and even posted faster two-mile times then Pre as a freshman and  sophomore, and I was in the Marshfield stadium when his running colleagues  carried the coffin onto the field for a memorial service before the body  was taken to its final resting place south of town, I fight to retain some  objectivity myself.
""Prefontaine"" was made by the people who  made the marvelous high school basketball documentary ""Hoop  Dreams."" It maintains a home movie/documentary style, with rough cuts,  uneven video quality, and faces talking directly to the camera (but they  are actors, not the real people from Pre's life).
Leto does a magnificent  job of appearing to be Pre, among shots of the actual man racing. Not much  else is distinguished about this film, however. ""Without Limits""  is a much slicker movie, which has its advantages, but I find it hard to  rate one over the other. They're just different ... and probably equally  wrong in many of the details. They reflect different folks' conceptions of  the man they knew: Pre's folks in ""Prefontaine""; Bowerman, Kenny  Moore, and a particular girlfriend in ""Without Limits.""
I'm  delighted that any film got made about this man, let alone two; I'm  gratified that either movie has served to inspire younger runners; but I  think it's ridiculous to argue that one or the other ""really""  captures the man.

I would just like to bring up some incongruencies with the movie and real life, though that often happens in Hollywood.  First, how many times have  you seen a pack of about 10-15 runners finishing in a span of about 5  seconds in a distance race.  Even if you get the elite runners of the  world, there is quite a gap between the first and the last runners.  If you  watch, all the runners are finishing within about this space of time.  Second, in the book, Pre, it states that Pre's friends never called him  'Pre' until his college years if I remember correctly, but at the outset of  this movie, the kids jumping off the bridge call him 'Pre'.  Thirdly, and  this one is just for Hollywood's sake, if you are going to film a distance  race and give them the space, don't let them run in lanes 6 and 7 when they  come across the markers that signifies that the are in those lanes.  How  many times has a distance runner in the middle of a race run in lane 6?  I  have never personally witnessed it and I have been running long track  distance for 10 years.  If you watch this film again, look for it in one of  the races, but I can't remember which one.  I give this movie 3 stars  because I am a distance runnner and just idolize Pre, but technically, I  would not recommend it to a runner.  The story works well for the  non-runner, but if you get to the gory details, the runner knows what is  wrong with the movie",918259200,,1496,4.15438596491228
902635,5,6304612982,I vaguely remember the 1972 Olympics when Steve Prefontaine failed to win a metal in the 5000 meters.  This movie brings back all those Olympic memories including the terrorist attack.  This movie should be an  ispiration for all atheletes. My daughter watches this movie for  inspiration before she runs in high school cross country and track meets  and will probably do the same next year when she runs in college.,917827200,,416,4.885714285714286

7874725,5,6304612982,"Some have criticized ""Prefontaine"" as too bland, colorless, akin to a tv movie. Those people probably hated Rocky, The Karate Kid, and The Natural too.  No, this is a well-made film, inspirational, and also received two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert. Much of the story is told as flashbacks by the people in his life, long after his death--mother, father, girlfriends, and coaches. As opposed to the Warner Brothers bio of Steve Prefontaine Without Limits, this film makes more use of other people in Pres life, especially his parents and his high-school girlfriend.

No one could fault either actors performance as the iconic Pre. Both actors bear an uncanny resemblance to the real man, even his upright running style. Analyzing the Olympic scenes of both the real guy and the actor, its hard to distinguish the two. ""Prefontaine"" spends more time on the Olympic hostage crisis, a good lesson for those who may have forgotten or never knew what happened there.

One amusing difference between the two films is the explanation for how Pre hurt his foot (requiring stiches) on the eve of his first NCAA championship meet. In Without Limits it resulted from some acrobatic sex with a local girl, while it was a foolish swimming stunt in Prefontaine.

Any critic must recognize Prefontaine as an example of the great work Jared Leto has created since this film.  His version of Pre is more combative, determined than Billy Crudups.  Hes not trying to win any popularity contests, although both films stress Pres confrontational attitude with those governing amateur American athletics at the time. The film is about fighting the establishment and hypocrisy but even more about single-minded determination and not allowing any limitation to stand in the way of achievement.

Lesson for life both films drive home: While winning is important, giving every thing you have every second is more important. Pre was quoted prior to competing in the 5,000 meter race at the Munich Olympics: if its a guts race, Im the only one that can win.

It is hard to imagine such a monumental cultural impact on sports and culture coming from a track athlete, but it really happenedNike co-founder Phil Knight compared him to Mohammed Ali, and the obvious comparison is to actor James Dean. I highly recommend this film to track and field fans and also movie-lovers who cherish true-life inspirational stories.",1499990400,2,2391,4.989949748743719
