8165444,1,B000M06F7K,"I purchased a used DVD from Amazon in June 2008 after reading the reviews about the multi-languages that can help in my child development.
However, the DVD I received cannot play any other languages except English.  I am very disappointed.",1215216000,,239,4.975
8165445,5,B000M06F7K,"I've been concerned with teaching my small children a second language since their birth so I've tried many different books and dvd's and I thought this one was the best.  It has the perfect combination of entertaining visuals, sound and music to engage my children and seduce them into absorbing the language lesson.  Plus, Sunny is adorable and the kids love him!",1174780800,,364,4.854838709677419
8165446,5,B000M06F7K,"This is the best tool I could ever find to teach my son. We are a multilingual family and really hope to teach our children our language, but living away from our country, it was hard to find the right books or CD to do so. Here it is, I strongly recommand it!!!",1174780800,,262,3.9622641509433962
8165447,5,B000M06F7K,"I have tried a few multilingual DVDs for my child and this is the only one that gives 4 central languages (English, French, Spanish and Chinese), all in one DVD and with native speakers!

We are a bilingual family (I speak French and my husband English) so this is the perfect tool to help us achieve our goal of teaching our child many languages.

I bought ""Bee Smart"" and ""Brainy Baby French"" but none met the standards: the narrators were not native and the words were not spelled correctly.

So if you are looking for a DVD that will prepare your child to globalization, this is the right DVD for it!",1174694400,,604,4.423423423423423
8165448,5,B000M06F7K,"After viewing the DVD only once, I was able to remember how to count from one to ten in Mandarin!  I like the action concept for kids (not just like the other videos we have seen that are more like still flashcards), and the idea to show my daughter 15 minutes a day is great.  We travel a lot, and she is proud that she has already learned some basics in several languages.  It has boosted her confidence, and she wants to learn more!

I recommend this DVD to both those who want to focus on only a particular language, and to those who want more than just one foreign language for their kids (especially if you travel a lot like we do); my daughter has been able to go from French to Spanish to Mandarin and with the material here, she seems to remember it better since the basics are repeated in such a way that important works are reinforced.  She just started a new school where Spanish is being taught, and by having her watch the Spanish part of this DVD, she feels more comfortable catching up to the rest of the class.

I am sure this DVD will outlast the others she has become bored of already, which is a great plus for me since I want her to stay interested in learning foreign languages!!!",1174608000,,1202,4.25
8165449,1,B000M06F7K,"Sunny Says - well, not very much at all.  This DVD was faulty, with no language tracks other than english, and had the appearance of having been burnt on someone's home computer.  Very disappointing, and needless to say I returned it.",1173484800,,234,4.682926829268292
