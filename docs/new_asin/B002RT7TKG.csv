8378863,1,B002RT7TKG,"This 15 minute  only DVD wasted at least half of the limited time on past history  and Cuba totally unrelated to the topic. The subject matter suddenly appeared in the middle for a few minutes,but the why civil defense title is totally misleading,especially considering that it cost more than 1 dollar per minute. This DVD was awful and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever! It was a waste of money!!",1375315200,,402,4.647887323943662
