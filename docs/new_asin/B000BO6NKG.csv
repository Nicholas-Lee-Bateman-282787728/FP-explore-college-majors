8638331,1,B000BO6NKG,"Despite being listed as a DVD (which would play in all devices and last a lifetime), this is actually a junky DVD-R that will NOT play in all devices, and will almost certainly deteriorate and stop playing in just 5-10 years.",1502150400,,225,4.512195121951219

8638333,2,B000BO6NKG,I have already seen these shows but was enticed by the labeling of Digitally remastered and sound enhanced. Don't get me wrong I love Roy Rogers shows but the video quality is no better than watching them from the internet. I would give 5 stars for the content but only 2 for quality.,1378512000,2,284,4.377358490566038
