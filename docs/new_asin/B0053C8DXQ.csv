8455145,4,B0053C8DXQ,"A young woman lives with her mother and brothers in an isolated home on the Kansas prairie. Unknown to her, and a life-long family secret, she was taken from an Indian tribe as a baby during a battle and raised as a white child in a white family. Now, the Indians want her back. This film builds slowly but is fascinating and suspenseful. Good acting, lots of action, and Audrey Hepburn shines in her pivotal role. Well worth watching.",1509753600,,435,4.518987341772152
