This documentary is telling what I have always wanted to know about the famous Israel's war history. When you read or watch things about the Israel-Arab conflict you can sometimes find yourself confused of the conflictive reports, This film will make some order in this chaos.",1247443200,7,434,7.346153846153846

8368199,2,B002EQA102,"This is poorly written and edited. It has an oddly inconsistent tone, as if it were patched together from various sources, without any overriding theme or approach. It's only real value, for someone like me who is very familiar with this history, are the occasional fascinating photos or film clips that I've never seen before.",1419292800,2,327,4.963636363636364
8368200,5,B002EQA102,The history was very informative.  There's a lot i didn't know about the how and why of Israel which was all answered in this movie.  Enjoyable for the history buff who likes to learn via film.,1377302400,,193,4.333333333333333
8368201,4,B002EQA102,Very interesting documentary. This actually gives you the real story of Israel and not the pro-Palestinian bias usually shown.  Well worth your time.,1375574400,,149,5.478260869565218

8368203,5,B002EQA102,This is one of the best documentaries about Israel's continuing fight for survival out there. I have already watched it several times and would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of modern Israel.,1353974400,,210,5.0285714285714285
