8536744,5,B002MW6BE8,"Yes,It's a Polish director with experience.
Yes,It's apart of Polish cultural heritage, which makes this box set collection a worthwhile purchase for all Poles including half bakes that aren't Polish.

It contains beautiful films for all of the family (especially those that love a true story).
Most of the dvd's in this collection have English subtitles and thats good for all the foreigners,asian kids & Most English speaking people that don't speak Polish at home.
In terms of value:Yes, it is worth your 150 dollars.

Andrzej Wajda seems to have become brilliant with age and his experience directing really shows in the imaginative film ""Pan Tadaeus"" which to many who know Andrzej's
films will definitely agree regarding this one as the BEST of all of them!

I could tell you the exposition to every film,how screen plays are executed,mention the ""hollywood famous"" actors and the cinematography (the pictures with original scenes)' but it would be much too demanding of your time' so I suggest see them for yourself as soon as possible...Wajda is a true pioneer with over 60 years of experience' He is the most prominent writer & director in Polish history' and for those of Polish background this collection is a must have!

I'm living in Manitoba,Canada and frequent the cinemas weekly (the last films I saw were Rango and Black swan) and it's getting quite expensive these days! I mention this as a reminder to those millions of people who may be worried about paying 150 dollars for 10 individual dvd's' to buy these dvd's seperately would cost up to 45 dollars (US) No lie,google it!
...
Good night believers and God bless (this means you!)",1302307200,2,1652,4.910394265232975

Czlowiek z marmuru (Man of marble), 1977

Plot: In 1976, a young woman in Krakow is making her diploma film, looking behind the scenes at the life of a 1950s bricklayer, Birkut, who was briefly a proletariat hero, at how that heroism was created, and what became of him. She gets hold of outtakes and censored footage and interviews the man's friends, ex-wife, and the filmmaker who made him a hero. A portrait of Birkut emerges: he believed in the workers' revolution, in building housing for all, and his very virtues were his undoing. Her hard-driving style and the content of the film unnerve her supervisor, who kills the project with the excuse she's over budget. Is there any way she can push the film to completion?

Plot: Account of the last days of life of the legendary Polish pedagogue Janusz Korczak and his heroic dedication to protecting Jewish orphans during the war.

His orphanage, set up in a cramped school in the Warsaw ghetto, provides shelter to 200 homeless kids. Putting his experimental educational methods into practice, he installs a kind of children's self-government, whose justice is in a big contrast to what is happening in the outside world. Right in front of the school, dozens of kids are dying or being killed everyday and their naked bodies lie on the street unattended. Ghetto's mayor assures Korczak that the orphanages will be saved. Korczak raises food and money for the orphanage from the rich Jews. In the final roundup he refuses to accept a Swiss passport and boards the train to Treblinka with his orphans.
