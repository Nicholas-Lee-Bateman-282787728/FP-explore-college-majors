3910108,4,B000BGITOC,"Although one must ask, 'Why remake a nearly perfect Hitchcock masterpiece?' there's no getting around that this 1959 technicolor thriller is thoroughly likeable in itself.  While lacking the original's taut pacing (and hence its sense of menace), snappy dialog and cutting-edge camerawork, the mostly UK cast here-- deftly led by the underappreciated Kenneth More-- makes this breezy update well worth watching.  Recommended especially for fans of the post-WWII period in British film.  3 1/2 stars.",1302912000,21,499,5.626666666666667

She tells him a story of intrigue but is killed by unknown assassins before she can finish the story. He flees to Scotland with the assassins in pursuit and eventually solves the mystery of the ""39 Steps"". This one is good and better than the one starring Rupert Perry-Jones that was done in 2008. However, for my money the best of the bunch is the one restored by Criterion Collection and stars Robert Donat...[..] .........this one is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. It's a good restoration worth the extra $$$. This adaptation of the book by John Buchan is the best one and is a classic.",1302220800,3,709,4.378787878787879
3910110,4,B000BGITOC,"What makes this the best of the 39 steps?  Taina Elg,  of course,  both naieve and feminine and at the same time, a match for Kenneth More who, while expressionless at times, nevertheless plays a man of the world who refers to Taina Elg (Miss Fisher),  his captive audience via handcuffs,  as ""Fisher"".  And when those stockings are removed in the guest house, it is sexual tension without crudeness at it's best.  The picture also captures accurately the country side of England & Scotland as well as steam transport of the time, an innocent society in a world gone by. Made in 1959 and 48 years young.  The see-sawing nature of their relationship works powerfully, dislike to respect,neutrality to love, and sets it apart from other productions of The 39 Steps. There is only one 39 Steps for me...... ah yes, Kenneth More and Taina Elg, a couple if ever there was one. Maybe Kenneth More can act after all.",1183593600,6,909,4.6375

Where it doesn't work is where it borrows directly from the 1935 film, but otherwise this is a fairly entertaining romp.

I purchased the Region 2 disc many years ago (and its one of several reasons that my laptop region is still set to that region) and decided to purchase the VCI edition a couple of years ago so I can watch the movie on my TV. The movie is quite simply one of the most enjoyable films out there. Certainly, like the Donat film years earlier, the plot bares little in common with the John Buchan novel it claims to be based on. Over the years the plot of the Hitchcock movie has become so entwined in the public mindset that I dare to say that readers would be shocked upon reading the novel - I certainly was when I was in university in the early 1990s and checked out a copy of the Buchan classic - no handcuffed to a girl across the Scottish moors in the book. Perhaps the most faithful to the book version is the 2008 BBC production or the excellent Robert Powell version of 1978. Still More is a far more likeable Hannay than the stuffy Donat and the color is well used to showcase some spectacular scenery -- A superb movie!",1390780800,2,1128,4.178899082568807

3910138,5,B000BGITOC,"The 39 Steps, 1959 film

This is another adaption of the famous novel from the WW I era. Richard Hannay made his fortune in South Africa mining and returns to London. A neighbor asks for shelter, she is afraid of enemies and explains why. Hannay agrees to let her stay for a few days. When he returns to his flat he finds her body and knows he is in big trouble! He decides to flee for his life until the murder is solved. A truck driver gives him a ride and tells him of a place to stay. The police are watching the trains and roads. Is there another way to get north? Yes. The scenes show rural England and Scotland as the background. A lone bicyclist pedals along the narrow country roads. A flat tire sends him walking. Hannay avoids the police. There is a large number of police searching for him. A man with a shotgun hunts in the fields. Oats are being harvested.

Hannay finds shelter and changes into his suit. He makes contact with Logan. He gets a shocking surprise over a mutilated finger! Hannay rushes away after drawing his pistol first. [The possession of pistols refers to pre-1920 Britain.] He gets away to report to the Sheriff. He then makes a dramatic escape by jumping out of a second story window! That truck stops by a large mansion, Hanny is mistaken for an invited speaker. [Copied in ""The Third Man"".] A fire alarm interrupts his speech, two detectives take him away. But he asks a young woman to send a message to Scotland Yard, and she too is arrested. Their car gets a flat tire and stops. This allows Hannay to drive away and make a run for it. They find lodging for the night. They explains they are a runaway couple. [Marriage laws differ between Scotland and England,] They cooperate to survive.

Can the woman slip out of her handcuffs? What next? She leaves, the door squeaks. But she hears those two detectives speak freely! Hannay's story is confirmed. They figure out that ""Palace"" refers to a theater. Hannay asks a performer about ""the 39 steps"". That man is shot before he can answer, but survives to answer a question about ""Boomerang"". The show goes on. The police are no longer after Hannay for murde.

This version is similar to the 1930s movie by Alfred Hitchcock, but better. John Buchan's novel is a classic story about spies and an innocent man who becomes a fugitive when charged with a murder he didn't commit. Buchan wrote other novels and led an interesting life as a soldier and diplomat. You can compare him to Ian Fleming.",1379203200,,2479,4.502222222222223

3910142,3,B000BGITOC,"As near as I can determine this was the second production based on John Buchan's novel.  The classic Alfred Hitchcock version from 1935 was the first.  Updated for the cold war, this version stars Kenneth More who was so good as a ship officer on the Titanic in ""Remember the Night.""  Here he is a playful bachelor on holiday in London.  He witnesses a woman pushing a tram get run down in the street.  When he goes after the runaway carriage he discovers nothing but a gun.

He reunites with the woman after she is discharged from the hospital only to discover she is an agent working for the good guys.  After she is murdered by agents in Hannay's (More) apartment, he avoids the agents and the police who believe he killed the woman.  Prior to her death, the nanny (Faith Brook) had given Hannay the information she had learned, but was missing a piece she expected to find in Scotland.  Patriot that he is, Hannay gets on the next train north.  It is on the train Hannay meets a woman (Taina Elg) who eventually becomes a surprising ally.

The actors work well together combining some drama with comedic effects.  There are differences between the Hitchcock film, certainly, but the basic plot remains the same.  While I favor the '35 version, this one is worth a comparative look.",1362268800,3,1285,4.583333333333333

3910144,4,B000BGITOC,"I acknowledge that Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 version
of John Buchan's thriller-chase novel THE 39 STEPS
is a classic.  However, the 1959 color remake, starring
a nimble Kenneth More, actually was the first version
I saw.  I remember it fondly, and for that reason I'm glad to see this
release from VCI Entertainment.

Stories are the same: stout Brit encounters
a woman, who winds up dead in his flat, and has to go on the lam.
He literally links up with a doubting female who
ultimately helps him foil the baddies.

Hitchcock filmed a suspenseful, studio version
of the book, starring Robert Donat and emphasizing suspense.
It's great.  This version - with suspense yielding to More's
brash humor and the beautiful Scottish landscapes - is an
equal delight (much as the two versions of THE ITALIAN JOB
compliment each other).  And I've never forgotten More hanging
on outside the streaming express, then slipping-sliding
away to escape from the dizzying bridgescape.

Well worth your time, if only for a slightly different take.  Beautiful

3910145,4,B000BGITOC,"Since so much has been written already, I will give you my views briefly. On the plus side: This version is sunnier, with real locales in Scotland, in good color, and light moments, as Kenneth More as Richard Hannay seems to have a lot of fun in a caper which is supposed to be manacing, but really nobody bothers to take the danger of the secret of the 39 Steps (the MacGuffin in Hitchcock) too seriously. More enbarks on his adventure more as a tourist having fun with minor mishaps, meeting a lady called Fisher, a shcoolteacher,whose disposition is also not to take the goings-on too seriously. On the minus side: this version--nearly identical to Hitchcock's--lacks the tension, suspense,and that thrill of real fear one finds in the '35 version. Donat's Hannay is a desperate man who seems a hero who runs for his life and also trying to unveil an intrigue that threatens England before the war. His partner, Pamela, as played by Madelaine Carroll, reacts to him as a real bitchy, repressed woman, hard as nails, but also sexy and alluring. Compare the two hotel scenes; in the '59 version, the scene lacks humor, or sexual tension; in the original, humor and sexual tension intermingle, as Carroll leisurely unveils her sexy legs as she peels off her stockings. Add Godfrey Tearle's Professor Jordan, the menacing leader of the plot with the missing finger; Barry Jones's Professor Logan seems rather irrelevant and only there for the plot. Besides, black and white photography, a bit murky admittedly, fits better the atmosphere of tension and suspense than the brighter colors, which sunnier and better for the eye. Kenneth More, to his credit, does make his film enjoyable to watch. But nothing beyond that.",1357171200,,1717,4.883561643835616

3910149,3,B000BGITOC,"If you were to ask the average young person about THE 39 STEPS, odds are they'll plead ignorance or shrug you off or maybe even suggest that it's a program for really, really stubborn alcoholics. But for old stalwarts like me, THE 39 STEPS is John Buchan's spy novel published in 1915 which was then adapted in 1935 into a smashing film by Alfred Hitchcock. There have been various film remakes since the Master of Suspence did his damn thing, but all are comparatively weaker stuff. Take this 1959 incarnation.

This do-over retains the core narrative, with minor tweaks. Only instead of the sexier plot device which opened Hitchcock's version (mystery woman picking up Richard Hannay at the music hall), in this 1959 iteration, things kick off when Hannay (Kenneth More) picks up a baby's rattle and ends up trailing a snooty nanny (who then gets run over intentionally). The nanny recovers rapidly and she later confesses to Hannay that she is a British secret agent tracking a spy organization that is in possession of top secret intel regarding a British ballistic missile project... blah, blah, MacGuffin.

When the nanny spy is fatally stabbed in Hannay's flat, Hannay goes on the run, with the police in dogged pursuit. Hannay has forty-eight hours to clear his name, find and expose the leader of the enemy spy organization, and prevent national secrets from being smuggled out the country. His clues are sparse: a map of Scotland, the phrase ""the 39 Steps,"" and that the spy leader can be identified by the missing top joint of his little finger. Off he goes on his mad, perilous dash across the Scottish countryside.

I like this 1959 version well enough. Director Ralph Thomas essays a more comedic tone, and I must say I enjoyed Kenneth More's rather jaunty performance (but he's no Robert Donat). Richard Hannay's appeal has always been that of a decent and ordinary man caught up in dire circumstances and forced to use his wits to get by, and More manifests these traits well enough. Thomas is competent with staging (or restaging) all the classic sequences, except that he simply doesn't have Hitchcock's panache or artistic acumen. And so the familiar set pieces come off as lesser bits of homage. Still, even if you've seen the original, there's much here that is serviceable and agreeable.

It isn't an entirely faithful reworking of Hitchcock's masterpiece. For one thing, Hannay runs into a different bunch of incidental characters, this time bumping elbows with a flirty crystal-ball gazer, a flock of giggling schoolgirls, and a batch of bicyclists. They don't really improve the story. And to espy Richard Hannay in those ridiculous blue bicycle short shorts is to lose a measure of respect for him.

The narrative is more leisurely paced, not as suspenseful, and I wonder how much of that is influenced by Kenneth More's studiedly nonchalant approach. Ralph Thomas's direction plays a part, naturally. I can't help but compare his and Hitchcock's presentation. For instance, Hitchcock chose to frame the two gents lurking outside Hannay's flat as two distant shadowy figures, and they seemed truly ominous. Thomas elects to give us a close peek at them, and this instantly dispels that sense of mystery, somewhat diminishes that sense of menace, reduces these two frightening skulkers into mere thugs or goons. Hitchcock knew better.

Hannay's impromptu lecture at the political rally is ixnayed in favor of his addressing a girl's school, and this was probably done so as to reintroduce our romantic female lead. Finnish actress Taina Elg steps in for the Madeleine Carroll role, and there's an immediate drop in sexual tension between the two lead characters. Ms. Elg's stab at reviving the (back then) provocative pantyhose-discarding scene at the inn is a pale imitation of how Carroll did it. Taina Elg is lovely to look at and I guess her performance is decent. But her schoolmarm character just didn't do it for me. Ultimately, this 1959 version is a passable distraction, but it can't hold a candle to the original film.",1309219200,3,4054,4.963181148748159

Directed by Ralph Thomas

Often criticized for being a shot-for-shot remake of the Hitchcock original, this film is in fact a perky little thriller which benefits from Kenneth More being a more sympathetic leading man than Robert Donat in the '39 version. However, the Kenneth More film is utterly enjoyable as a bit of light drama. Certainly the underlying plot is worthy and overall,

Kenneth More is really in fine form on this, and actually uses the dull background to great effect by allowing himself to become the focus of the film at all times.

Having seen the original version by Hitchcock, its the same story which was in black and white with an awful picture and sound quality.  I have most of Hitchcock's films on DVD and there's no advantage to the Hitchcock film over this one - on the contrary this one is better.

In addition to that we have some humorous touches absent from the original one. So I for one would thoroughly recommend this one, even though I am a big HITCHCOCK FAN, just being honest.

3910151,4,B000BGITOC,"I first became acquainted with John Buchan's classic spy novel, THE 39 STEPS, when I was in the seventh grade and my literature teacher read it aloud in class.  The story fascinated me and looked forward to that class every day, so that I could hear the next chapter or two.  I didn't see a film dramatization of Buchan's work until 1959 when I was a senior in high school.

VCI Entertainment has now released that movie, directed in Eastman Color by Ralph Thomas, onto DVD.

THE 39 STEPS (1959) is a very good, entertaining thriller.  Kenneth More is quite likable as Buchan's hero, Richard Hannay, who finds that he must go on the run, heading to Scotland, after a British secret service agent (Faith Brook) winds up dead in his London flat.  It's a race against time.  With both the police and numerous foreign agents after him, Hannay has only forty-eight hours to prevent the plans for a vital weapons system from being transported out of the country.  Taina Elg co-stars as the reluctant schoolteacher who Hannay ""drafts"" into helping him achieve his goal.

The ""elephant in the room,"" of course, is Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1939 filming of THE 39 STEPS, which this 1959 version draws from liberally.  I didn't see Hitchcock's movie until I was, I believe, a sophomore in college.

There is really no comparison between the two pictures.

Ralph Thomas made a delightful chase movie that can/should be enjoyed in its own right...but he was not Hitchcock.

Nobody can remake Hitchcock...except Hitchcock.

Furthermore, instead of his calling for the police and telling them what happened, he decides instead to run away to Scotland and pursue the spies based on a flimsy piece of information that she gave him, thereby automatically making him the prime suspect in the woman's murder. Lastly, the ""boomerang"" is supposed to be a secret weapon, yet everyone seems to know of it (if not the actual technical aspects). I must admit that the way in which the secret is relayed was ingenious, but that's about it.

Alfred Hitchcock did an earlier black & white version which I feel was better. What makes this version worse is that he character is going through the moves like it's all a big joke, whereas with Hitchcock, you got the feel that it was a life and death matter.",1524009600,,1136,4.48792270531401
