1996386,4,B0001FVDG4,"Finally the original Teen aged mutant ninja turtles!!!  I made sure I got this DVD as soon as it came out.  This is definatly one of the best cartoons ever made.  I'm glad to finally see it on dvd, I can't stand the new series.
 This cartoon takes place in what I think is the greatest era of  cartoon making and animation the mid 80's early 90's.  It is about time They start apperaing on dvd.
 The early TMNT is a 5 star quality show, the reason I give it a 4 is the DVD itself isn't the greatest.  This dvd should have came in a 1st and 2nd season box set.  the dvd contains all the  5 episodes of season 1, and 4 bounus episodes of season 6 I belive.
 This DVD would be a sin not to own, for any cartoon fan!!  (...)All I say is put the rest of the original series coming to DVD.
TURTLE POWER!!!",1082592000,2,799,3.925
1996387,5,B0001FVDG4,"At last its here. I no longer have to watch dodgy copies of of the first 5 eps which I got from a guy in the US.
These episodes were never released in the the UK, when the show aired here we were introduced to the Teenage mutant HERO turtles as they were called (kids in the UK weren't alowed to see anything with the word ninja on it!!) half way through the eye of zarnoth.
Not to mention that all episodes had the nunchakas cut out!!
But one day years and years ago I taped how it al began off sky and discovered the origins of the TMNT cartoon. This tape was like gold dust to me until my sisteer taped over it!!!
I thought it was amazingly done and since these first 5 episode came out of another animation studio it was excellently drawn. (Japanese studio, After that I think Fred Wolf set up in Ireland)
This is the best cartoon version and in my opnion along with the first movie the best versions of TMNT.
Onto the DVD. Decent box and menu presentation, does its job.
Picture and sound are excellent, although I wish the music was alittle louder.
As for the bonus episodes. There a total waste of time. I would much rather have some episodes from the next season on dvd instead. Anyway, its for the originals that we all brought it for. Buy this now, especially if your a TMNT fan from the UK, as its more than likely that you haven't seen these ones.",1082419200,7,1359,4.210727969348659
1996388,5,B0001FVDG4,"I have ben waiting sooo long fore this two happen. I watched every episode in the past and ever scents it was canceled in 1996 I have ben waiting fore them two bring it back. In 2003 thay did but when thay did thay changed the cartoon so mutch it dose not even seem like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles some times. Finally on Today we can watch the cartoon the way it was ment two be again. Lets keep the DVD Seasons coming.

1996389,5,B0001FVDG4,"If you were as young as I was when this show was on, you loved it. While viewing this now you may find it very much for young children, you will love it for the nostalgia, and you'll remember fondly how much you thought this show was cool. And it was, so buy the DVD and show it to your younger brother, who is a big fan of the new version on FoxBox, and then start acting like an old guy. ""Back in my day, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was like this, and it had choppy animation, no digital effects, ridiculous plots and writing, and that's the way it was AND WE LIKED IT! Yippee! Go ninja go ninja go!"" I apologize for that awful Dana Carvey bit, but if you agree with me that all the best kids shows from this era are sadly overlooked these days, you ought to buy this and remember.",1082246400,2,784,4.064516129032258
1996390,4,B0001FVDG4,"TMNT was the first independent comic book to hit it big. The marketing world came a knocking and (creators) Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird answered the door with a resounding ""where do we sign?"" As such, they were largely left out of the creative process, though they did create/design a few characters (Bebop & Rocksteady) and got the final say on the scripts.

This was not very faithful to the comic stories or even the characters too much (Raph is a wise-guy instead of angst-ridden, no deep thoughtful emotion from April, no philosophizing from Don, except as a joke), but the satire of the comic made a fine transition.

This first season, a five-part mini-series really, is of fine quality. Far more care with the art and even voice acting is paid than in the successive seasons. I suppose with higher episode orders they just got sloppy (though there is a slight variation among these five as well.) The animation is fine for its time and medium; dated by today's standards of course. The music was effective, at times appropriately eerie or foreboding, dream inducing, playful, and driving and energizing (especially the memorable theme song!) The humor is witty and many scenes are charming. The balance of action and humor is much better here than in the following seasons. Krang was genuinely weird and Shredder mysterious and menacing. Later the show would become a parody of itself, still milking (less cleverly) the satire of sheltered youth raised on TV, but here it is all fresh and sharp and decidedly serious enough. Each episode excites as the full story mounts with each successive chapter towards its climax. The rest of the series is fun, but this is the real gem.

Here is a break-down of the actual DVD and its packaging:

The Cover: The image that was touted months ago as promotional ""working art"" is indeed the final cover. That's good news for those who like it and bad for those who don't (I think it is lame personally; why not some art based on the episodes therein?). You do, however, get a glossy cardboard slip with ""bumpy"" TMNTs and letters to run you fingers over (wahoo!).

The menus: As Michelangelo would say ""lame-ola""! The main menu uses the front cover art and the episode selection uses the back cover art (the only way it could have been any more generic would have been to had the Artisan and FHE logos in the background). No snappy animated sequences to take you to the selection you clicked and worse still, no menu music! That's right no TMNT credit theme, nothing but the hum of your DVD player and television set.

The episodes:
Picture and sound:
No attempt to clean up the picture has been made whatsoever. Picture artifacts abound in the '87 epsidoes. The picture is also a little ""grainy"" (though I don't think it is bad; It is identical to the FHE laserdisc releases, for any who own them.) The sound was not improved either. While it is clear, it is quite low, similar to 60s cartoons on DVD. The newer episodes on the disc are better of course.

Bonus material:

The ""unaired"" episodes (actually, 4 episodes from season 10, the ""Red Sky"" days,) are the ONLY bonus material on here at all unfortunately.

As for the actual 'toons, if you are reading this you've seen them, and if you love them like I do you'll buy this any way. I will mention that they are indeed in their entirety (not the 72 minute edit that was originally slated for release) and includes for the 1st time the opening theme, episode title screen and closing credits for all episodes. (I should mention that annoyingly enough each episode is on one track only; like on a VCD).

This sure beats having the former FHE releases of the mini-series on 3 SLP tapes (and taped from TV versions of the ""unaired"" eps). If you have the laserdisc releases of the mini-series and don't like the ""unaired"" episodes (I know some didn't like the ""red sky"" days. I personally thought they were great) you may want to pass, as the quality is exactly the same.

- poor menus, one track per episode, lame artwork, no extras, ""unaired episodes"" advertisement misleading, no remaster job.
+ great mini-series finally in one place with titles and all. 9 episodes on one disc.

1996391,5,B0001FVDG4,"You know i love the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, I have loved them since I can remember.  I have all of the movies on VHS and now dvd.  I am gonna get the new seires box set, but not till I get the original and best series of them all.  I love this show always have always will. The only thing i think stinks about this DVD is the fact that they are putting some of the less cared about episodes on here.  I would think that since they are hopefully gonna put out season 2 and so on that they would save these for later.  But oh well I don't care i'm just happy to finily get to see the original TURTLE show the way it was ment to be seen, ON DVD.  If you like me and you love things from the past then get this DVD.  Now all they need to do is put out a THUNDERCATS dvd and I will be set.  And get that SUPER MARIO BORTHERS DVD when it comes out to.

1996392,5,B0001FVDG4,"I have been waiting for this for nearly eight years, and finally the moment I've waited for has come.  The classic cartoon from the 80s and 90s finally goes on Digital Video Disk, and I couldn't be happier.  Being a loyal fan of the series, I would constantly watch over my old videos and recordings of this, wishing I had a season collection to see the few episodes I actually missed, and get the ones I had lost after all this time.  And now, the moment has finally come.  No offense, but as the good as the new show is, it just doesn't have the certain charm this show did.  Plus, we can't forget the catchy theme song, something, ""1, 2, 3, 4, Turtles!,"" fails to live up to.  It's going to take forever until April.....",1079568000,3,723,4.279411764705882
1996393,4,B0001FVDG4,"Whoever referred to this toon as the ""orginal"" turtles is right in one sense, wrong in another: yes, it was the original CARTOON, but it wasn't the very first incarnation of the TMNT; the black and white comic series by Eastman and Laird was.
Regardless, this was the toon I grew up with in the late 80s and early 90s, althrough I didn't really start watching it until the show's third season in 1989 when I started collecting the toys.  I was 5 years old then, and it's been just over 14 years since then and I'm still lovin' the original toon.
Despite the rating I'm giving it here, the first season of the original toon (which is what this DVD contains) deserves a full 5 stars due to its action, edge, and overall more maturity than the later seasons; seasons 2 and 3 still had the action, albeit a bit humorous, but from seasons 4-7 it just went totally goofy and completely lost that edge the first 5 episodes had, not to mention the dialogue turned into a total laugh-fest for how ridiculously stupid it turned.
The reason I'm taking off a star on this review is the fact that the ""previously unaired episodes"" really aren't: all 4 of them are from season 10 of the series that aired in 1996, its finals season with the new villain Dregg.  Because of that, it will totally mess up the continuity and flow of future season sets should this line continue.  But then again, I'm a purist.

As for this first season, I thought it was good because the first five stories where the defining episodes of the series; the stories that put this animated series on the map back in its day. For this reason alone, excluding the budget friendly price tag, I would have been okay having only these five episodes on the disc. However, as a bonus you get four never-seen bonus episodes, four stories from the tenth and final season that, according the legend, were never aired on TV. Please correct me on that if I am wrong. Alas, while I like that we get them, I find it a flaw they are included with this volume. If these never-before seen episodes were the ""final four"" then to me it would have made more sense to include them in the final volume especially because of the series' make-over from season 8. For this reason I gave the product four stars and not five. Despite this flaw it still the official release of Fred Wolf's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1996468,4,B0001FVDG4,"When I was a kid, the original 3-part mini-series blew me away. I was hoping for something to help curb the loss of new shows from my beloved Transformers and G.I. Joe, and the mini-series showed promise to fill that hole. Had to get all the figures and the Eastman and Laird comics as well thanks to it. However, IMO, the show got progressively worse (in stories AND animation) after the 1st 3-part mini-series, which is why I only got this one edition, because it had that pilot series. The show overall doesn't hold up as well looking back as a kid. But still fun.",1439942400,2,567,4.40952380952381

That being said the down side is, compared to the other ""TMNT Volume x"" releases this has less cartoons on it. Also the chapters just go from episode to episode rather than point in that episode, which is slightly irratating. All in all though, if you are a Turtles fan or are buying for a Turtles fan I'd  certainly recommend this.",1406937600,,484,4.5

The Shredder was way cool, he is for sure one of my all time favorite villains, the voice acting is really good in this show and the animation is great, I always preferred the 80's and 90's animation, I HIGHLY recommend this, well worth getting, an absolute blast! Enjoyable for kids and adults, adults would probably be more keen to this than kids now a days though.

1996625,5,B0001FVDG4,"This is hands-down the best season of the original series.  At this point, the cartoon still has a fairly cohesive plot and most closely keeps to the original source comic book material.  I'll list the reasons why this is only season of the original that you should buy.

- The characters haven't become caricatures of themselves yet.  How everybody delivers their lines at this point doesn't sound like they are phoning-it-in.
- The Shredder is still focused on revenge over silly woooooorld domination, leading to a much more interesting plot.
- Bebop and Rocksteady are actually threatening and physically rough-house the turtles a bit
- The turtles actually use their weapons.
- Michaelangelo doesn't talk like a burnout yet
- The animators put MUCH more work into shooting the scenes from interesting angles (cinematography)
- The jokes are much more witty at this point with better thought out dialog (David Wise, thank you)

The first season, even with its flaws (such as the wrong-colored headbands in some scenes), is great family entertainment for all ages.  As the owner of the first 3 season DVDs, I always find I love the first season.  I can bare the second season.  I turn off the dvd player by the second episode of the third season.

I'm a big fan of knowing the history behind something and even though these are fictional children's characters its kinda cool. There are I think 5 episodes totaling almost an hr or so.

It's a really light hearted series with a lot of action, humor, likable main characters, and cool villains. This particular season contains the first 5 episodes, plus 4 bonus episodes.

The 5 episodes of season 1 are:

Turtle Tracks
Enter The Shredder
A Thing About Rats
Hot Rodding Teenagers From Dimension X

1996701,5,B0001FVDG4,"Everyone born during the late 80s or the early 90s saw the original cartoon for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & loved it.  Some of us still love it, while others have come to enjoy the new show more.  I'm somewhere between the 2 camps.  I was born in 1989, but I didn't actually see any episodes on TV except for the ones with Lord Dregg, which I still love (!).  Then after that I rented & bought any of the VHS tapes I could get my hands on.  But how does this show hold up?  I admit the new show is technically better produced & written & a lot more consistently entertaining then the old show, but when the old one is good it's wonderful.  And it's never been better than the 5-part pilot.  The first thing you'll notice is the animation.  Compared to how the show would look for the next 6 years & even after that it's quite good.  It's done by the Japanese animation studio Toei, who did anime like Sailor Moon & the Dragonball cartoons, as well as animated other American 80s classics like G.I. Joe & Transformers.  The writing is also a lot better.  While the later ones tended to be too goofy, this gets the balance between comedy & action just right.  And boy, is the action exciting, even by today's standards.  When people complain about how the show isn't as action-packed as the intro, they forget that this was what it accompanied at first.  Even the voices are a bit better, especially Cam Clark as both Leonardo & Rocksteady.  I'm sorry, but this is pure gold, even without the nostalgia.  And no matter what, this is canon with Archie Comics' TMNT Adventures series, and I'm certainly not going to argue with that.

So, how do I feel about the rest of the show?  I'll be honest with you, while seasons 2-6 are incredibly hit or miss (with a LOT of misses, but with some really good hits too) & the first half of season 7 is horrible, I think the latter half of season 7 & all the red sky episodes (seasons 8-10) are great; almost as good as the pilot & fun to watch even compared to the new show.  I know I'm in the vast minority when it comes to the last seasons, but that's another review to be discussed another time.",1367884800,,2141,4.278606965174129

1996707,5,B0001FVDG4,"I had been curious to watch this series again, since I have very fond memories of the shows from my childhood.  The complete boxed set was abruptly discontinued, so I'll be trying to collect all of the volumes and season sets individually.

There were only five episodes in the first season, which is sort of a miniseries to introduce the Turtles and establish Shredder as their main enemy.  I did watch one of the ""bonus"" episodes from season 10, but want to wait to view the whole series in order before watching any more.  If you buy the season 10 disc, it should duplicate the ""bonus"" shows from this DVD (plus the portions of season 10 that weren't included here).

Without giving away too many spoilers, I noticed recurring themes in the miniseries.  One I had kind of missed while growing up - the idea of Master Splinter returning to human form.  Raphael felt like a slightly different character.  I knew he was a wise guy who liked to joke around and use sarcasm.  In these episodes, I saw a more caring side of him, whether he was encouraging his brothers, or expressing concern over Michelangelo getting buried in a pile of rubble.

My 5 star rating is mostly based on the content.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the audio and video were probably left as is, rather than being remastered.  My setup is a progressive scan DVD player, outputting via component cables to my surround sound receiver.  From there, the receiver supposedly upconverts the video to a 720p signal, and I watch the shows on my 32"" 768p HDTV.  On the couch, I'm probably 8 feet or more away from the screen, so the video looks fine.  Episode #2 had some weird ""artifacts,"" where it looked like extra lines were added to the picture (maybe from the deinterlacing process?).  The sound isn't overpowering, with a simple two channel stereo format.  I had to turn it up a little bit, but voices are clear, and I didn't hear any background noise (unfortunately, some of the other DVDs in this series do have audio issues).

What more can I say?  If you grew up with the Turtles, this is a good purchase or rental.  I'm looking forward to collecting and watching the remaining 188 episodes!",1366675200,,2177,4.605194805194805

The turtles survived the battle with Shredder, but they have been beamed to an alien of planet called D'Hoonnib. The first part of season two goes more for a science fiction feel. Not a good as the first season, but it is still enjoyable.",1345680000,4,767,4.226027397260274
1996759,5,B0001FVDG4,"Season one debuted as a five-part miniseries (Some places aired it as a pilot movie titled Heroes in a Half Shell.) in December 1987.

The DVD of Season One was released in 2004 on a single disc. There are no extras except for the four out-of-order episodes from Season 10, which can be a bit confusing for a new fan.

The episodes on the DVD are:

Turtle Tracks
Enter the Shredder
A Thing About Rats
Hot-Rodding Teenagers From Dimension X
Shredded and Splintered

Bonus Episodes from Season 10 are:

The Beginning of the End
The Return of Dregg
Monsters from Dimension X
The Day the Earth Disappeared

The original five episodes go more by the comics than the rest of the series did. This is must have for TMNT fans.",1345334400,,717,4.476923076923077
1996760,3,B0001FVDG4,"I used to love the Ninja Turtles when I was younger. I decided to watch a few episodes for the 25th anniversary of the show. Sadly, it hasn't aged well. The animation is OK, but there are a lot of obvious errors and points where the animation doesn't look like it aligns with the background. The dialogue is very corny. Worst of all, it's tough to take Shredder seriously knowing he's voices by James Avery of Fresh Prince. Splinter also seems lot goofier than the wise rat I remember. I can see why Eastman and Laird renounced this cartoon.

Despite this, it's still a fun series for kids. There's a lot of action, slapstick jokes, and cool creature designs. I'd recommend it for kids, but adults seeking to go on a nostalgia trip might be disappointed.",1343433600,2,754,4.544117647058823
1996761,5,B0001FVDG4,"The helmet is symbolic for the first outing of the pizza-chowing Ninja Turtles. The reptilian, ninja-fighting foursome Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo and Donatello and their battles against the evil Shredder are one of the poster-childs of 80s and 90s culture. No other animated show can to this day boast of sporting a quartet of ninja turtles, a rat ninja master, a warthog with a mohawk and an awol militant-clad, trigger-happy rhino. It's not hard to see how all this captivated a boy's imagination. And this is where it all started; the five-episode pilot season of 1987. Sure, it is short, and maybe the DVD's quality is not as crystal clear as we have got used to. Sure, there are no special features to speak of. But that doesn't change the fact that this is the definite DVD to get if you want to see the pizza-chowing foursome at their finest.

April O'Neill, a hot-shot TV reporter, is covering a story about a series of raids of scientific equipment companies when she is assaulted by a gang of thugs, sent to stop her by an unknown person. She is saved by four humanoid turtles. They and their mentor, Splinter, were mutated by a special mutogen; the turtles into humanoid turtles - Splinter, who was once a man, into a rat. Eventually, the Turtles learn of the existence of a ""Technodrome""; an underground, mobile fortress from which ninja master the Shredder and an extra-dimensional brain named Krang are hatching a scheme to take over Earth, with the dubious assistance of mutated punks Bebop and Rocksteady (who sports a helmet in this season that he never does again, for some reason).

TMNT is famous for being a fun, action-filled series and this 5-episode pilot season delivers, and then some. Not only is it a blast to watch, full of great characters - it's also an intricate ninja crime story. All episodes hang together like an intricate chain, even though all have a separate story to build on. All help to bring the story, slowly, forward, bringing a great level of consistency to the show's first moments. All courtesy of writers Patty Howeth and David Wise (the latter of whom wrote several stand-out episodes later in the series but even then never managed to top himself).

Does that mean that it's a completely infallible piece of entertainment? Of course not. Especially the first episode has more cheekiness and conundrums in it than you can shake a katana at. The reason it works is because it's a very tightly packed together story, and because there's such an air of fun over everything. The animation may not be perfect but boy did they try. This season was art-directed by Peter Chung, of later on Flux fame, and the animation, though technically not perfect, is alive and of high standard for tv at the time.

This is also probably the one Ninja Turtles season that takes itself seriously, at least in some way; Rocksteady and Bebop are dangerous, violent foes in this season. Sure, there's a lot of humour that's predominant but I just wish that the entire series could've been like this season. It's slick, it's funny, it's entertaining, it's well-woven. It's great. I could not have hoped for a better reacquaintance with the world of the Ninja Turtles than this season. As I watch, old fantasies of being a rhino man are reawakened. This first season is where the Ninja Turtles are at their finest.",1341878400,,3344,4.770293609671848

We will burn through these very quickly and I fear my son will lost intrest in it.

This is the five episode pilot that later launched into the mega hit cartoon that made these characters household names. There's familiar characters, some new, & some re-imagined, & despite the show being very different from the comic books this pilot is arguably the best of the entire show in terms of story, animation, & action as it later went into a much more slap stick comedy direction with lower quality animation. If your a fan of the TMNT 2K cartoon series this one is a good prequel even though both shows are very different from one another.

Anyway this is the 1st season on how the turtles begin which is a story of splinter not the turtles where saki the shredder gets yoshi kicked out of the japan foot clan an force him too go to new york an some kid drop the 4 turtles down an their all mutated into human turtles an splinter into a rat.

U know the whole story, they met April by saving her from humans Bebop an Rocksteady in some punk gang going after april.

2nd episode Shredder is introduce and Rocksteady & Bebop turns into mutants.

3rd, baxter stockman is introduce along with mousers

4th episode is the 1st appearance of teenagers an stone warriors from deminsion X.

5th episode is where Krang 1st gets his robot body an him an shredder goes into deminsion X at the end.

Some mistakes the made of the cartoon. on beginning of the 4th episode shredder talks little bit about rest of rocksteady an bebop gang, which they are mutants as well, an end of 5th episode the punks are in some sort of prison in the technodrome and the punks appear again on the episode called THE GANGS ALL HERE on middle of season 3, an they aren't mutants in the technodrome prison. An Jersey Red isn't even on season 1 either, its like the writers didn't continued where they left off an acted like that thing never happened.

Anyway thing about rats too, baxter had short hair but on return of the shredder(1st half of season 2), he had long hair, then short again when he turned into a mutant fly. Again the alien computer comes on bye bye fly episode an son of the return of the fly, and revenage of the fly too. But the talking computer is no where too be seen on landlord of the flies.

BYE BYE FLY 3rd season
Son the return of the fly 4th season

landlord of the flies 5th season.

revenage of the fly 7th season.

An on season 8, the turtles finally captured the rat king, but nothing happens too leatherhead on season 7 at the end of night of the roges episode.

Leather Head chracter was never finished.

Baxter ends at some prison without talking computer at end of revenge of the fly episode(season 7), Rat King gets captured by the turtles(8th season), Bebop and Rocksteady last episode is end of 8th season which their some where in deminsion x.

An Scum Bug, Ant Trax appeared out of no where on mid 7th season an they got away at the end not captured or anything.

The show is great an way better than todays cartoons an 2003 tmnt's.

I grew up watchng the show and even back in 1991 when I was only a 11 that time, I thought on 1st five episodes that the punks were a waste of characters because they did nothing on 1st season except tried going after april at turtles tracks(1st one).

Shredder: Your body is one of many biomechanical experiments I am currently conducting in the Technodrone right now, Krang. (Presses button, and on monitor, picture with mutants in cells appears) See, Krang? I'm still experimenting with my mutations on the punks. This next batch will be infinitely superior to these two losers. (Points to Bebop and Rocksteady)

Bebop: Hey! Whaddya mean?!

Rocksteady: You just give us one more shot, pal. And you'll see some squished toidles.

Krang: Why are you wasting your time making more mutants? My legions are amass in Dimension X waiting to conquer this planet!

Shredder: Dimension X! Of course! Your home planet, it is a place of total war, is it not?

Krang: Yes! A war that continued after I was banished here.

Shredder: Then I will obtain the weaponry I need... by pulling it out of Dimension X! (Goes to open portal)

Krang: (Chases after him) Saki, you can't!! There's no telling what will come through that portal!! [

Response to the goof about the Mousers: Shredder made all of them except the original, but they all had the same imprint on the bottom of their feet, hence the line ""An exact reproduction. Perfect down to the last detail."" Besides, the authorities wouldn't know that he made them, since his name was nowhere to be found. [edit]
At one point, Mikey is told that Baxter was arrested for 'trying to take over the city with his mouser robots'-- He didn't. Shredder tried to kill Splinter with them. [edit]
Shredder turns the rest of Bebop and Rocksteady's gang into mutants, but he never used them to fight the Turtles",1293235200,2,4759,4.548651817116061
1996777,4,B0001FVDG4,"I grew up watching the TMNT as a child and this dvd was something to bring the memories back. Volume 1 starts off telling the story of how the TMNT got started. Also, it's a good price for the number of shows. When I first watched the shows on the dvd I was expecting a lot more violence, suspence, and drama. But I had to realize that this is a kids cartoon. Futhermore, TMNT would have been nice to include more detailed fight scenes, suspence to keep the viewers on there toes to know what might happen on the next show, or drama to keep the viewers more excited.

On the other hand, it's a nice show to watch even after its debut from the 80s. TMNT have a lot of entertaining scenes on the dvd. After all, Leonardo is the leader of the pack, Michelangelo is the life of the party, Donatello is the brains and genius, and Raphael is the rude boy, that can be sarcastic at times, and is aggressive. Each turtle brings a different personality to the table to keep the bad guys away and the fans wanting more.",1291680000,,1009,4.227979274611399

1996779,4,B0001FVDG4,"Although this is just like how Season 1 was handled, containing the first half of the season, which I find rather convenient than how some shows are handled these days.  Picking up where Season 1 left off, this time the turtles end up in another world in outer space as well as another galaxy.  The turtles start off helping a professor that had his mind transferred into that of a robot and trying everything they can to help him out every way that they can.  As when the turtles get back it then picks up at the same place that Season 1 had ended, but it takes it a step further as this show of turtles is definitely has improved in many ways from that of the original show.  This set of Season 2 does end with a character that was seen in the original show but he's not the same as that in that original show.

1996780,3,B0001FVDG4,"The original television series of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles made it way on to DVD after all these years.  While this set brings back the memories of when I was growing up when I was young as the episodes are like I remember when I watched them in the late 80s, although there are a couple things I'm don't like with this set.  One of the first things is that this represents the first season with the 5 episodes that made up the season but there aren't any bonus features such as how the thought of a comic characters going from paper to television.  Not only that 4 episodes that are not part of the season on this disc, and I wonder what was the reason for that decision, that really don't make any sense on that.

While at the time this show came out I didn't know that the show was derived from a comic until years later, though that this season does try to tell a story like the comic but doesn't tell the story like that in the comics has done.  It's still a popular show by the time that these episodes aired at the time that it did and kids everywhere enjoyed the show.  I have to mention that the animation team that was responsible for this did an alright job, though the animation at times could have been better at least to me it could've.  Overall I give the show 3.5 stars out of 5 but some bonus stuff instead of bonus episodes could've done this set a little better for me.",1279756800,,1396,4.186567164179104

ZERO for the DVD. there was obviously NO effort put into it. such a classic show deserves better treatment than this. the episodes don't even have chapters. you have the play all button, and the episodes are chapters themselves. the video is slightly grainy at times, but nothing to serious. you get 4 ""bonus"" episodes from the shows later seasons which are just terrible. anyway, on with the positive. can anybody name one childrens series from '87 thats still so successful today? i didn't think so. this original miniseries gives you the first five episodes. here you learn the turtles origin, along with the history between splinter and shredder. you also see the first confrontation and defeat of shredder. a classic show. anybody who watched this as a kid should still enjoy it now.. with a little help from me friends.. ;)

The really like how the story is a continuation and while each episode may have its own little story, it is usually related to a previous episode in the time line.  Unlike the original series, it carries a plot over several episodes which allows for a more interesting experience.

1996799,4,B0001FVDG4,"This set contains the first twelve episodes of season 2 of the 2003 TMNT series. It's odd that 4Kids/Funi have only chosen twelve episodes, since this season divides cleanly with 13/13 (season 1 had a multi-parter  and the 12/14 split made more sense). Maybe they'll revise the set before release?

Whereas season 1 returned the Turtles to a more ""gritty"" setting, season 2 launches them into space(and later, parallel dimensions). The first five episodes pick up from the season 1 cliffhanger and have our foursome protecting the Fugitoid robot from the Triceraton and Federation soldiers. The next three episodes finally bring the Turtles home and end with a shocking (and controversial) reveal of the Shredder. Taken with ""Search for Splinter,"" it's a non-stop 10-part saga! The set caps off with a filler-ish recap episode, the return of the Nano robot, and introductions to the Ultimate Ninja and Leatherhead (now sans the cajun accent).

In all, it's a fun ride. Season 2 does seem a bit more random in spots, as it's more mini-arcs than one season-long arc. You might question what the whole ""Turtles in Space"" saga amounts to, but that pays off in spades down the line. Anyone who enjoyed the first season episodes will likely enjoy this set.

1996804,5,B0001FVDG4,"I grew up watching TMNT, and was delighted when the DVD release of the original series was announced.

This release features the entire first season from 1987. This can be a little misleading, as the first season only consisted of 5 episodes: ""Turtle Tracks"", ""Enter the Shredder"", ""A Thing About Rats"", ""Hot-Rodding Teenagers From Dimension X"" and ""Shredder and Splintered"". Over the course of these episodes, we see many Turtles favourites introduced; Shredder, Krang, April O'Neil, Bebop and Rocksteady, even minor characters like General Tragg that were known best for their action figure counterparts!

To compensate for the short first season, a bonus four episodes from 1996's Season 10 (which never made it to British TV screens) are included: ""The Beginning of the End"", ""The Return of Dregg"", ""Monster From Dimension X"" and ""The Day the Earth Disappeared"". While these episodes are quite interesting to watch from the perspective as someone who only saw the first couple of seasons of the show as a child, they don't have the same magic that the old episodes had; the animation looks a lot cheaper, like many modern cartoons, and much of the humour from earlier episodes is absent.

Unfortunately, there are no documentaries about the cultural impact the show had or anything along those lines, which would have been very interesting. The only bonus features are the extra episodes.

I personally hadn't seen the first couple of episodes until buying this set, since the craze reached my school a few episodes in. An interesting note about the first season is that the episodes follow a linear storyline, and the episodes are sequential (some taking place directly after the events at the end of the previous episode).

The DVD picture quality is good. The quality is crisp, considering it is a cartoon from 1987. Some imperfections can be seen fairly frequently, though this is probably due to the age of the cartoons and the quality of the original broadcasts and not due to poor production values, as the 1996 episodes are much crisper quality. Sound has the slight imperfections that you'd expect from a cartoon from the 80s, and is completely listenable.

Menus are excellent, featuring great airbrushed art very typical of original Turtles merchandise and artwork from the late 80s and early 90s.

The DVD comes in a case within a foil-enhanced cardboard sleeve featuring some great artwork of the Turtles emerging from the sewer in the airbrushed glory of 1980s, cartoon New York. This is the most attractive of any of the DVD releases so far. Artwork quality on subsequent releases decreased significantly.

A fantastic trip down memory lane, and well worth the price!",1176595200,3,2686,5.047404063205418

1996806,3,B0001FVDG4,"The season that started the phenomenon. Going back to see the original five episodes of season one of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brings back memories of my childhood. For the Turtles collector, this is the quintessential DVD that begins the whole series and, for that reason, makes Volume 1 a must-have. Unfortunately, while the original five episodes from season one are all included in their classic glory, they are about all this very simple DVD has to offer.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Original Series Volume 1 begins with the premiere episode ""Turtle Tracks,"" and introduces us to April O' Neal, The Shredder, and more importantly, the Turtles themselves. The following four episodes all center around the introduction of the Turtles and Shredder's incessant plots to make them all into turtle soup, all culminating in the season finale, ""Shredded and Splintered."" Fans will appreciate the preservation of all five episodes, and seeing as how these are probably  some of the most important episodes to the series, fans will surely want to pick this up.

Unfortunately, five episodes are all you're really getting here. There are an additional four episodes from season ten that never aired, but their inclusion is strange. I personally never saw the later seasons of the show, and the bonus episodes all focus on Lord Dregg whom I had never seen up until now. There's no real explanation for some things, and for the most part, the bonus episodes remain uninteresting compared to the main attraction of this DVD. What would have made more sense would have been to start with the first couple episodes of season two. Still, even with the lack of substance and the very plain DVD presentation, Volume 1 will find its way to the Turtle fan's shelves because of the original five episodes.",1175212800,,1795,4.976666666666667

If you are looking for some nostalgia or a great fun cartoon for your kids to enjoy, then pick this up and order some pizza.  Ralpheal is cool, but rude.  Michaelangelo is a party dude.  Leonardo leads, and Donatello does machines.  That about sums about the character traits, but this is a great story/viewing that shows the first 5 episodes from the original cartoon from the 1980's.

1996809,5,B0001FVDG4,"This show became one of the most popular and original animated shows of all time ever since it's debut in 1987, it actually all began as an independent comic book in 1984 that became an instant cult favorite. Then in 1987, it was sold as an animated series that started a mini-series first thus it was a success and a pop culture phemeneon spawning merchandise, three movies with a fourth one on the way, a musical tour, and more for it ran from 1987 to 1995. The Story deals with four human-like anthropomorphic mutated turtles who were once ordinary turtles turned to what they are thanks to chemicals especially their once human master named Splinter who are trained in the art of ninjetsu as they befriend a beautiful news reporter named April O'Neil to fight crime and battle the forces of the evil Shredder especially munch down pizza.

This DVD has the first five episodes which were actually part of a mini-series that lead to the successful show. The first part ""Turtle Tracks"" introduces our heroes Leonardo, Donetello, Ralphel and party-loving Michaelangelo especially April, Splinter and The Shredder plus their origins next there's ""Enter The Shredder"" where the turtles track down the Shredder plus the dreaded brain-like creature named Krang from Dimension X and two dim-witted mutants Bebop and Rocksteady. ""A Thing About Rats"" has a shy scientist named Baxter Stockman who just made pefect robotic mouse-traps becomes a pawn in Shredder's game to kill Splinter, ""Hot-Rodding Teenagers from Dimension X"" is exactally what the episode's title says as punks from another dimension just wanting to have fun here on Earth get in trouble with the warlords and the Ninja Turtles to protect them and finally ""Shredded and Splintered"" has Krang with a new body as it rampages through the city and only the turtles can stop it.

The picture is decent and so is the sound and the only extra is 4 never-before-seen episodes shown in the U.S. as an extra. So if you still love Ninja Turtles, then go out and get this.",1170201600,42,2021,4.855072463768116

Sure, the way the turtles acted/spoke was a lot less serious and ""adult"" than the original comics, but this was a cartoon for kids, after all. I was also amazed that I could remember just about everything that was going to happen next. Amazing, since I hadn't seen any of these episodes in about 16 years. The quality of the episodes are great considering the age of the material. I'm not sure if they remastered the episodes at all, but if they didn't, I'm surprised the show is in such great clarity.

1996813,5,B0001FVDG4,"I was about 5 or 6 years old when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles used to come on television on Saturday mornings in the late 80s/early 90s. I used to love waking up extra early on Saturday mornings before mom and dad got up and would plop onto the couch in the den and zone out with all the Saturday morning cartoons, but the Ninja Turtles were by far my favorites! My favorite was Leonardo (the blue one with the katanas) and still is! Perhaps it's just the opinion of an 80s baby but I look at what TV stations have as the cartoon lineup for Saturday mornings now and it's just not the same. (I'd even say some of newer cartoons are...weird and boggles my mind as to how they'd be enjoyable to a child.)

This is a splendid DVD collection collecting the original first five episodes (while there are four other ""lost"" episodes) which are the ones I really care about, especially because I used to have the equivalent episodes on VHS (still do actually) and them being on DVD is even better. I really like the episode ""Hot Roddin' Teenagers"" with Krang and the teens from Dimension X. Or how about the episode with Baxter Stockman (aka the Fly) and the mousers? People: THIS IS GOOD STUFF! (Especially if you LOVE cartoons!)

They tried to revamp the Ninja Turtles in the mid-late 90s into a grittier, darker team which is a pretty series but doesn't even come close to the original series. I agree with one of the reviewers before me who said the artwork in the original series looks like an Americanized version of anime: I couldn't have put it any better. They have a very ""cartoony"" look and feel and that's just the way I liked 'em and grew up with them. Who doesn't like James Avery as the Shredder??! (You know, James Avery, the man that plays Uncle Phil on 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'.)

Every cartoon fan NEEDS this in their collection: it's incomplete without it! I can't wait to get my hands on the later volumes. Long live the Ninja Turtles!",1162252800,2,1954,4.4525139664804465
1996814,5,B0001FVDG4,"First off i have to say that i was a fan of this show at one year old. Being born in '86 i grew up with the Turtles.  I had a good handfull of the VHS tapes but not all of them.  It took me a while to get the DVD's now for their rerelease only because i was a little ashamed of going to the store and buying them.  I finally bought this volume (#1) and i have to say its a little scary to be watching these episodes after all these years and remembering the lines!.  I tried watching the new series but it just doesnt compare to my childhood memories of the Originals.  This disc contains the 5 episodes in the 1st Season.  To compare with the other volumes it includes 4 Never before Shown Episodes from '96.  If you were a fan back in the day you will laugh with your Kids? again at these episodes.  The 4 New ones however are great, very par with the originals but i don't have the same childhood feeling i have with the originals.

Well for any old Turtle lovers out there, be sure to pick this up.  Dont be ashamed at reliving your childhood, it was the best years of your life

And for the New Turtle Fans, the ones growing up on the new series, you should bug your parents to buy these ones, im sure they will want to watch them anyways",1159488000,3,1243,4.012195121951219

I love everything about this show. There were so many cool characters in this show like Viva and Rocksteady, Shredder, Krang, and of course the turtles and the Techmodrone was awsome too. I totally remember watching this on USA along with G I Joe and the Real Ghostbuster and I'm so stoked that i can finally watch it again. Younger kids should watch this too so they can realize how much their shows suck. Did anyone else realize that the guy doing Shredders voice is Uncle Phil from Fresh Prince.

1996819,5,B0001FVDG4,"Without question, this series is a must have for both kids and adults. I must give a warning for us adults, however, it is extremely cheesy compared to how we used to watch it. Cowabunga is no longer the popular word out there, and we don't need the obvious explenations anymore. But it is spectacular to remember all the good times. If you are able to recall your childhood mentality and excitement, it is absolutely spectacular!

  A MUST HAVE FOR KIDS!!! Have you seen some of the shows kids watch these days??? What happened? What happened to the original TNMT, Captain Planet, Astro Boy, etc??? Cartoons used to have morals, messages, points in general! Its important for kids to get those messages along with some entertainment to make it stick. But I'm not here to rant, I'm here to review.

Here's the Episodes on Vol. 1:

 -Turtle Tracks

 -Enter the Shredder

 -A Thing About Rats

 -Hot Rodding Teenagers From Dimension X

 -Shredded and Splintered

 -Plus 4 never-before-aired episodes that really belong on the last volume.

I highly recommend this one, as well as the other two volumes. The Episodes are in chronoligcal order from start to finish

I swear, if you weren't old enough to have watched this amazing series when it first aired, don't even think of standing within ten feet of this DVD at the rental store. Why? Because you won't be able to appreciate something that was painted by hand, on thousands of cells. And even worse, you'll compare it to the new crap on Fox just as the yutz below did. If anything is poor-quality, it's the animation from the new (and vastly inferior) series on Fox. The turtles don't even have pupils for Christ's sake! They seem to be suffering from whatever Batman was inflicted with in Batman: The Animated Series whenever he put on his freakin' mask. For the uninitiated, the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pilot was aired as a miniseries in over several EVENINGS in December of 1987. It did not originally air on a Saturday morning. It's a shame most of the Turtles franchise wasn't as good as this five-episode pilot and the first movie by Steve Barron.

This DVD gets 4 stars. The five-episode pilot is just as amazing as I remember from '87, but the awful episodes from the last two seasons with Dregg are trash.",1111276800,7,1352,4.652719665271967

1996837,3,B0001FVDG4,"I loved that this DVD was so inexpensive but had on it an hour and a half of some of the finest work ever put to the saturday morning cartoon line-up of the 80's.  All five of the defining episodes of the series are here, as it is for the most part the pilot for the series.  The four green heroes, along with their master Splinter (aka Hamato Yoshi) and April O'Neil, go up against Shredder and his brain pal Krang and try to save the world from ""Dimension X"".  Looking back now it's actually as enjoyable for the nostalgia as it is for how it resembles americanized anime.  The wit and simple action is all represented in the original five, leading up to and including most of the original figures and set-ups from the toy collection.

HOWEVER, as a DVD set it's none more impressive than featuring the basics to the five episodes (no seperate language/audio tracks, no subtitles, no trailers, no behind the scenes footage), and the only bonus being four ""never before seen episodes"" (as they very well may be, as I can't remember them for the life of me), which are some of the lesser ones.

1996838,4,B0001FVDG4,"I've seen Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles through almost all of it's stages: the original B&W comics by Eastman and Laird, this late 80's cartoon, the old Archie comics and now the new Fox Kids show.

These cartoons differ from all other incarnations in many ways. ""Serious"" has nothing to do with this cartoon. The plot is radically differant from anything else you've seen. Splinter, instead of being the pet of Hamato Yoshi actually *is* Hamato Yoshi. Where as every other incarnation of T.M.N.T. is dark and gritty, this show refuses to take itself seriously.

While that may be seen as a bad thing to most fans of today, it should be remembered that without the late 80's cartoon show, many people today might never have heard of the Turtles. This cartoon is what brought the Turtles into the spotlight. As corny as it may be for today's standards of dark and gritty story telling, this series is no less a classic. For those with a sense of nostalgia for the shows we used to watch as kids, this DVD is a great buy.

Over all grade: Great to have the original series on DVD, minus a star for less than steller digital transfer. Still a great buy.",1100044800,10,1149,4.541062801932367
1996839,2,B0001FVDG4,"I am perhaps one of the most biggest fans of TMNT. Which is why I find it very hard to say what I am about to say.  First of all, my review of this series is bittersweet because on one hand, i love to watch cartoons from my childhood because, and I don't think I'm alone in this, it takes me back to a time when I didn't have to worry about too much of anything except homework and bullies.  There are may times that I say that kids today are being robbed of good cartoons like the ones people my age used to watch as kids.  But on the other hand, when I watched the TMNT series from beginning to end recently I was reminded of how progressively worse this show became when the eventual commercialization of an otherwise great underground phenomenon caused it to become just a shell of it's original concept.  And believe me when I say that this is not the 24 year old man talking right now, this is the child that he once was, remembering how it felt to have to turn my back on one of my favorite cartoons because the characters I came to know and love ended up making fun of themselves by the series' end.  I mean, I look at the covers of the dvds and I see a bunch of bright colored, wacky looking, smiling swollen turtles and I ask myself, ""How did it come to this?""  The original TMNT were a group of rowdy, misunderstood teenegers who had to deal with their adolesence living under the streets of the city.  The only reason they didn't get out of hand was because of the discipline and training from their master, Splinter.  They fought the Foot Clan, ate pizza, rode skateboards and drooled over April O'Neal all in one episode.  Cool right?  But somewhere down the line this all changed.  Somewhere along the line they started smiling more.  Somewhere along the line the Foot Clan went from formidable human being opponents to robots that fall apart at the slightest hit.  Somewhere along the lines they carried their weapons but they would end up fighting with yo-yo's, fruit, dodgeballs, pies, etc.  And can someone please tell me when did they start eating pizza with toppings such as ice cream, jelly beans, and brussel sprouts?  I guess for nostalgic reasons I bought this because like I said before, it took me back to a simpler time in my life.  But if you ask me, the new TMNT show has taken the turtles and their story back to it's roots and anyone who is a true fan of the TMNT will appreciate a decent cartoon finally getting to air on saturday mornings.

1996843,4,B0001FVDG4,"When I bought this, from the reviews I'd read I'd assumed that this was one of those ""best of"" collection DVDs. I was disapointed but wanted an ORIGINAL Turtles fix any way I could get it, imagine my surprise when I found a collection of the first episodes. It also includes (oddly) some of the 'last unreleased episodes which I'm assuming they put on here because they knew that they wouldn't sell that well if they were a stand alone at the end of the DVD season run. Anyway, to my point...

I know many of you complain about this only being 5 episodes and they need to release seasons etc etc... but the fact was, the first Turtles cartoons shown was actually only a 5 episode series arc introducing them and seeing if they would be popular enough to continue as a full blown season. If it had bombed they would have canned future TMNT episodes that they were working on. As we all know, it took off and they rushed more out. THIS IS THE FIRST SEASON, I know its small, but it was all there was at first. I just hope that they hurry up with season 2 and on. This really is something they should have addressed better on the DVD packaging and the product description on this site.

The ""unaired episodes"" I barely watched, I'd sadly stopped watching TMNT by the end of the shows run so I have no idea who these other characters are etc. Annoyingly, these unaired episodes start in the middle of a story arc about Leo's mutation being unstable or something, again, I stopped watching them, I'll bring them out to watch after getting (and seeing) the rest of the seasons of TMNT. I suggest buying it for the begining of TMNT, not these extra episodes.

As for the technical issues, yes, these episodes sadly aren't the best they could be, they're dirty, and slightly grainy (the reasons that it only gets 4 stars). But they don't look any worse than how they looked on TV (and obviously look much better than the VHS cassettes).

People, Please realize that what you're getting *IS* the begining of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and buy it, so that we can get the rest of the seasons on DVD as soon as possible.",1093392000,4,2114,4.412820512820513
1996844,4,B0001FVDG4,"Back in the 1990's this was the show that every teenager and younger wanted to watch. Four regular turtles transformed by a genetic mutegen into anthropomorphic fighting ninjas known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Leonard lead, Donatello was the brains, Ralphael with an in your face attitude and Michaelangelo was a party animal.

Now thanks to DVD all fans both old and new have a chance to get reaquanted with our four favorite turtle warriors. The first five episodes of this long running series as well as the five last episode of the series are available all on one disk.

It's a great start but also a bit disapointing that it's being done this way. This will more wet your appetite then soothe your hunger overall. It will give you a taste of what the show has to offer but leave you hanging a bit. I am a bit surprised that the whole first season wasn't released in a set rather then doing it with just the first five episodes as well as some bonus episodes at the end of the series which had a totaly differnet take on the series by the time it was ending. so that too may confuse people rather then satisfy.

In the first five episodes we learn about the originals of the Turtles and their master Splinter who is a former Ninja teacher from Japan who was mutated with a rat at the same time the Turtles themselves were mutated into human form. They meet their human friend, a reporter named April O'Neil who becomes a trusting and loyal ally who seems to get mixed up in all the trouble that the turtles do. Their fight is against Shredder, an evil leader of a gang known as the foot clan who wants to take over the city and more. Shredder is being helped by an alien brain from Dimention X known as Krang.

This series is a bit dated. A lot of the animation is old style and the sayings and situations can be corny as well. Even back when I watched it I found it a little on the campy side, but I think in a way that was part of the thrill of this cartoon. It's fun, action packed, humorous at times and kicks major shell. I am only disapointed that we only get a few episodes to start us off rather then a whole season. But I am sure we will see many more episodes to come in the future and good things are more then worth waiting for.

 MY favorite teenage mutant ninja turtles character which is one of the bad guys is BAXTER STOCKMAN the fly, unfortionally they don't show him as a fly on DVD.

 I already have a tons of ninja turtles VHS tapes, but I search though the whole tire internet an can't find REVENGE OF THE FLY, and TURTLES TREK episodes to buy or down load.

 turtles trek is one season 9 on tmnt series.

 But it was nice of them to put dregg on bonus episodes cuz I like him to, but I'm still dissappointed cuz there's alot of old skool ninja turtles episodes out there that I want to see, defenly the 2 I listed.

1996847,5,B0001FVDG4,"OK, after reading some of the reviews that have been posted since my last one, I feel obligated to clear a few things up.
First and foremost, to anybody who keeps referring to this as the ""original"" TMNT: this cartoon series was NOT the first incarnation of the turtles!  TMNT started out as a black-and-white, PG-13 rated comic book series created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman in 1984, 3 years before the original cartoon ever premiered.  It was definitely NOT something for young kids to look at due to the amount of violence and general content of it, plus ALL the turtles wore red in that one, not just Raphael; the only reason they have different colored bandanas in the cartoon was so children could distinguish who was who.  It was this series that about 90% of the first movie and the current cartoon are based off of.
Next, for those who are totally confused about Dregg:  Dregg is an alien, meaning he's not from Dimension X.  He's in no way connected to Shredder and Krang other than when he pulled them out of Dimension X in the hope that they could help him defeat the turtles in a 3-episode story arc in the last season of the cartoon.  He didn't totally come out of the blue either; in the first episode of season 9, ""The Unknown Ninja"", Dregg makes his debut when his ship (the Dreggnaut) enters our solar system.  He's a fugitive of war and trying to find gold (for what purpose I don't remember).  One thing leads to another, and he and Hi-Tech make plans to sneakily conquer Earth, and of course the Turtles come to the rescue.
Now, what do I actually have to say about this particular DVD?  Not much since I've already reviewed it twice below, but I will say this:  given the reaction of some of the people who bought this and their disappointment with the content of the DVD, I have my own personal hopes that this was nothing more than a market field test to see how much people wanted to see this show on DVD.  I think it worked out pretty well, which brings me to my suggessting to Artisan if they're reading this:  give the show its proper ""season set"" treatment including a basic cover art layout that can be applied to all future sets, more appropriate bonus materials such as old toy commercials et cetera, and, while it might be impossible to do, a complete remastering of the audio and video, including replacing the modified/muffled version of the opening theme with the one where ""Heroes in a half-shell"" isn't distorted (it exists, I have it too).
This release still deserves all 5 stars regardless.",1090022400,3,2536,4.525164113785558
1996848,4,B0001FVDG4,"As thrilled as I am to know that the golden egg of childhood television has been brought to my home, especially since it's in DVD format this time, I still have my share of complaints against the DVD itself. I don't know if some of these drawbacks were because of monetary problems or something else, because they seem like problems Artisan could have easily circumvented, but whatever the reason, it should be changed for the next TMNT DVD. And it really, really would be in Artisan's best interest to make another one of these DVDs. Fans who watched this show a little bit more than a decade ago and fans of the new series will always continue to purchase these DVDs as long as they continue to be released.
THE GOOD:
-I like the slip on cover. You don't see too many of those these days outside of Disney DVDs. But they did make it a little too tight...
-Some may complain about the simple, silly looking artwork, but it fits the DVD just fine. The silly, simple happiness of the cover captures the essence of the first season, if not the whole series. However, future season DVDs should have a different, maybe more exciting cover, like with Casey Jones/Krang/Shredder/etc. (this cover suits this DVD perfectly, though).
-The price. Another reason why I would buy ten of these DVDs (if there were ten) instead of two of the new TMNT DVDs.
-The original TMNT were brought to DVD!!! This mere fact makes this DVD better than most out there. PLEASE RELEASE MORE OF THESE ARTISAN!
THE BAD:
 -The bonus episodes. Initially I was excited to finally see the tenth season episodes that I knew were not available on VHS (nor were shown on television), but it was way too early for these episodes to be released. First of all, none of the fans have any idea where this Dregg guy has come from, whether he is an alien or a Dimension X fiend, and what his connection to the Shredder/Krang is. I did like Lord Dregg, however. Introducing a down-to-evil-business baddie is a nice contrast to the silly Dimension X freaks (not that I don't love them or anything). They were out of order too...I watched the first bonus episode, then the second bonus episode, then I had to go back and watch the first bonus episode again just to understand what was going on. If they are going to release a small part of a saga few fans are familiar with, they can at least put episodes that follow each other one after the other and putting them in order wouldn't hurt either.
-Bad choice of bonus episodes. To elaborate on what I started saying above, there are plenty of better bonus episode choices they could have made. Such examples would include character fan-favorite (episodes) like ""Slash"" and ""Usagi Yojimbo"" (fans of the Usagi Yojimbo comics would love this, too). Those episodes are also not available on VHS. Whatever they do...they better not include the concluding episodes in the next DVD...because many fans would not feel like buying any DVDs they would release after that, since they know the ending.
-Why no special features? Is it because there were bonus episodes? If so, then I take this comment back: special features are NOT a better alternative to bonus episodes, at least not for the first couple of season DVDs. Still, an interview, some old commercials, movie/toy/cartoon advertisements, new TMNT previews would be greatly appreciated.
-Lack of subtitles. Yes, I can speak english just fine, and understand it too, but I still could have swore I heard ""noobs"" and ""boob tube"" being said in the first couple of episodes. Subtitles should not be a high priority should Artisan release another season, but they will definitely not hurt.
-Chapter breaks. Not only could you not press rewind from the beginning of one episode to see the end of the previous episode, but chapter breaks in general did not exist.
-Boring DVD menu. I didn't expect for them to put an episode as an intro, even so, they could have put the instrumental [original] theme song in the background if nothing else. Or, just, anything really. Too simple.
Maybe some of these flaws are because of the wonderful cheap price, maybe not, but if so, then Artisan should consider increasing the price $5-10 to make the DVD a little bit more exciting. I know I would put down that extra bit of money if the DVD was bettered somehow.
I am giving 5 stars to this release because it's the original TMNT and 3 stars to the DVD quality, so the average would make that 4.",1089936000,,4427,4.646683673469388

1996850,5,B0001FVDG4,"After reading through a number of reviews on this DVD release, only one question comes to mind: ""What is wrong with you people?""
I don't understand some of your arguments at all.  So what if the cartoon-transfer isn't up to DVD-quality standards; we should be eternally grateful that Family Home Entertainment gave us what we wanted.  For years, fans of the old cartoon show have lamented the fact that our beloved Heroes in a Halfshell had not been given the special DVD treatment.  And now, after all that time, we're finally given what we've long awaited for . . . and all you people do is complain.
Moan.  Whine.  Groan.  Bellyache.  See a pattern developing here?  I could go on and on.
And did it ever cross your minds that some of us actually like the box cover art that Family Home Entertainment chose to represent its release?  The old cartoon was known for its goofy nature, its appeal to children, and its loveable/huggable characters . . . even the bad guys.  Don't go disrespecting the box cover art because you think it should represent today's age demographic.  Whatever.
It's fine.  Leave it be.  End of story.
I am happy that the old cartoon has finally made it to DVD.  I don't need 101 extras to make it a worthwhile addition to my collection.  Millions and millions of fans wanted one thing, one thing only, and we got it: the old cartoon given the DVD treatment.
Be grateful for what you've been given; don't grumble.  Family Home Entertainment didn't have to give us anything at all, but they did.
Accept the DVD release for what it is, and get on with your lives.",1087603200,7,1586,4.551236749116608
1996851,5,B0001FVDG4,I was a bit skeptical to purchase this dvd because I heard that the quality is that of VHS. I wasn't disappointed at all after receiving it because this is pretty much as good as it gets. It's not like they have the money to digitally remaster the episodes like what they did with Star Wars where they spent millions of dollars in doing that. The quality isn't bad at all and the dvd takes up alot less space than with 4-5 vhs tapes so I would definetly recommend this to the TMNT fans. I don't think I will be purchasing any more TMNT dvds though because the first 5 episodes are the best of all of them and the series just goes downhill after that(IMO). This dvd however is awesome!!!,1087171200,,686,4.244274809160306
1996852,4,B0001FVDG4,"I really enjoyed watching this. It's been so long since I've seen the original series, that I have forgotten a lot of it.
I was a little worried I wouldn't like it that much. However, was pleasantly surprised that I still found it amusing.
Really good to watch. Just wish that the DVD transfer was better.",1086393600,,305,4.464285714285714
1996853,3,B0001FVDG4,"Well I really can't complain much. However, I am disappointed that there was no special qualities on this disc.
They also could have had other season onto it. I mean one disc can hold a lot of stuff on it. It's like they didn't even try to make it a nice set.
However, besides that. I am very happy to have this in my collection. I grew up with Ninja Turtles like a lot of people, and I think it's wonderful that it's finally out on DVD.
 I just wish they had spent more effort of the DVD packaging for the original program.
 This is the story of four mutant turtles. They are taught the ways of life through Ninja. By their father ?master? Splinter. Who is a mutated rat. Who was once human.
The story concept may sound cheesy these days. However, it really is fun though.
 I even found my self liking April O?Niel more. The turtles human friend, who is a reporter.",1086307200,2,866,4.236363636363636
1996854,3,B0001FVDG4,"LET THE BUYER BEWARE! When I bought this, I fully expected DVD quality, since I was BUYING A DVD!  But no, let it be known that the episodes on this ""DVD"" are actually just transfers from old VHS tapes.  The video quality is quite poor.  A couple of reviewers here stated that the quality is ""very good"" and ""amazed at the clarity of the picture"".  I can see if you're watching these on an old CRT TV, the shows might appear to look fine, but anyone who has a decent screen is going to notice the fuzzy matte lines and picture quality, excessive grain, dirt, artifacts, etc... a real mess from a standpoint of video quality.  One of those reviewers points out that at the bottom of the back cover it says ""Digitally Mastered"".  The key word is ""Mastered"" NOT ""Remastered"" which is what you should look for in a DVD.  Essentially, all ""Digitally Mastered"" means is ""this is digital.""  Which doesn't say anything, since the DVD format is digital to begin with.  TECHNICALLY it's not Digitally Mastered, since that implies that this is equal in quality to a Master Copy, which it is not.

That same reviewer also stated that the DVD was originally planed on being released as a single movie, with the original 5 episode miniseries edited together as a feature film. It should be noted that some of the animation in the original miniseries is on par with some of Japan's best anime, and I personally would have liked to have seen this, but at the same time I can understand and appreciate fans' wanting to see the opening and end credits of each episode remain intact.  But if they do end up releasing season 2, you would have seen that on those episodes anyway, so it would have been nice to see that as a viewing option on this disc.

I was disappointed that after a decade, the old TMNT episodes are still owned by FHE, the company that put out the original VHS tapes, which were poor quality also.  Now they're back and they're up to their old tricks.  The only plus side is that the box comes in a fancy reflective slip case, which successfully tricks you into thinking you bought a quality DVD.  On the downside, the cover art is just like all the TMNT merchandise was ten years ago, with ultra-sugary renditions of our favorite heroes, which says to me that FHE still views this as a kid's product.  They need to wake up and realize that the target audience of this DVD is now 18-25 year olds.  They should market and package it thusly.

My question is, if a DVD comes out and it's not DVD quality, why should I shell out money when I could just keep my bootleg and VHS copies, which are just as good?  If I had felt I had gotten my money's worth, this DVD would have had animated menus, chapter breaks, featured some music from the series either as special features or as accompaniment to the menus, and most important of all: been Digitally Remastered from the original source material!

A for effort, but F+ for crushing my hopes and dreams.

But a 10/10 for the shows themselves.  I pray they'll get good treatment one day.",1085356800,12,3030,4.451086956521739
1996855,5,B0001FVDG4,"More than 2 years ago i started thinking about the Turtles, and how i could watch them again. After trying to download some episodes on Kazaa, which never worked for some reason, i logged onto Amazon.com and, by coincidence, the original Ninja Turtles cartoon set had been released for only 2 days!
So far i have watched the first episode, looking at the animation and hearing the voices it is not entirely as i remembered it, you can see the show has aged compared to the latest cartoons of today. But this series for me is the memories of running home off the schoolbus to get home in time to see the show at 3:30pm. This show i am sure, will not appeal to the kids of today, but people of my age will fall in love with the turtles once again!

1996856,5,B0001FVDG4,"Well, to begin with, I live in London, and this is where I grew up. Now there's nothing particularly wrong with that, we still got the good stuff. I grew up on Thundercats, Captain N, Inspector Gadget, Ducktales, Transformers and of course, Turtles.
Turtles became an obsession for all people my age. I can honestly say, that I have never seen such a craze, spread so fast, and last so long. It was an incredible time to be a kid. You couldn't step outside without seeing something Turtles.
A couple years into the show though, my older brother got his hands on the original Eastman and Laird comics, and there was something of a surprise in store for me.
You see, over here in crappy old London, your fantastic show, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, had been altered when it came over here, to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.
After some brief research, I discovered that not only were we watching a show with the wrong name, but all, yes ALL of Michalangelo's nunchuk scenes had been cut out. So much so, that even the intro had been eedited in such a way to cut them out, and the first five episodes were never aired in London, because of how much he used them.
Anyway, the hunting began. And ever since then I've been searching for those first five and just about any original US episodes.
Well, now the wait is over, and I have them all, US, and unedited on DVD. And thank God, they left the grain on and didn't clean it up, making it look bright and ugly like a new cartoon.
So that's that, this cartoon altered the lives of an entire generation, and if you were part of that generation, then I would expect you to buy it.
A fantastic kids cartoon, truly unbeatable.
One thing always puzzled me though, in my country, nunchuks are banned, and therefore they weren't in the Turtles, but then how come absolutely none of Panthro's nunchuk scenes in Thundercats were ever cut?
That's Britain for you.

Though not as dark as the original comic book, this is what most of the world percieves as the correct Ninja Turtles. The best show I'm debating between the original and the new but they are more then worthy to pick up. Most of us remember the cartoons when it was on CBS for a good 5-7 years. but These episodes were the original syndacated episodes with the original intro sequeance, different style of animation and some different voice actors. All in all though these episodes are the ones where we meet all the recurring charechters- The Turtles, Splinter, April, Shredder, Krang, Baxter Stockman, Bebop, Rocksteady, the Foot Soldier, Aprils boss Vern and a slightly less annoying Vernon. All in all it's a great set to get. However the 4 bonus episodes are from the second half of the last turtles storyarc when they fought against an alien named Dregg instead of Shedder. While not as good as the originals the Last season of the original show was more edgier and dark using the animation style of the Batman animated series. Even this is somewhat of a bonus (though it seems they might not do every season) I say this is a good buy",1083801600,6,1209,4.5504587155963305
1996861,4,B0001FVDG4,"Anyone worried about possible censorships can put that to rest.

This DVD contains the first five episodes from the series that started in 1987, plus four bonus episodes featuring the Turtles' last arch-nemesis, Dregg.
Alright, let's get the minor bad stuff out of the way. The screen occasionally jumps but doesn't lose picture. There is also one point where the screen goes completely blank for about one second. Thankfully, that one second is nothing except part of the technodrome blasting through rocks. No big deal unless you're an obsessed collector. Fans might also be dissapointed that that special features are nill. I personally would like to have seen profiles of the characters. The last flaw is that the bonus episodes are shown in the wrong order. That's all.
Those who did not watch the series to its end may notice in the bonus episodes that Michaelangello now uses a grappling hook instead of nunchukues. That is because nunchukues are banned in some parts of Europe, where the show also aired.

1996865,5,B0001FVDG4,"Well, here it is, turtle fans: the wait is finally over. After months and months of waiting, the original '80s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that I, and 90% of kids my age (even some girls) grew up with, have finally been released on DVD! So the big question is: is it worth it?
Yep.
First of all, the packaging. As stated previously, it comes in a shiny, metallic box, with the artwork you see above you. Inside, is the actual case, with the same artwork, but without the metallic luster. Nothing outstanding, but pretty neat.
The picture and sound quality are very good, considering the age of the episodes (they aired December 1987). Yes, the animation pales in comparison to the animation of today, but keep in mind... DECEMBER 1987. But overall it looks and sounds really good.
Okay, now for the most important thing of all: the content. When you first pop the DVD in, as stated before, there is no background music at the main menu; just the hum of your DVD player. This is no big deal, but it would've been pretty cool to hear the closing theme (the one they play over the credits).
The main episodes that this set contains is the original 5-part miniseries that started the whole series. They are five seperate, 22-minute episodes (complete with opening theme song and closing credits), but are all linked together. It tells the origin of Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael (my favorite turtle), Michaelangelo, Splinter, April O'Neal, Shredder, Baxter Stockman, etc. These early episodes combine the familiar one-liners and funny character building scenes with great martial arts action; a great mix.
Now for the bonus episodes: these are from the last season (1996). By then I was 10 years old and not really into TMNT anymore. These are the infamous ""red sky"" episodes that you hear so much about. They certainly aren't as horrible as some people make them out to be, but they're not that great either, IMHO. They changed the original theme song that everybody and their mother's familiar with, replacing it with some goofy, lackluster techno version. Also, they sort of redid the animation; the Turtles now had weird-looking eyes. Also, they gave April bright blue eyes (VERY nice) but took away her infamous, attractive yellow jumpsuit (bogus). They also added some new character; a  kid named Carter. And of course, instead of Shredder, they now fought some alien named Dregg. (ehhh...) These episodes aren't really bad or good. Needless to say, the originals are much better.
So if you're a fan of the original TMNT like me, or even if you just want to dive into the history of animation (or learn about 80's cartoons), buy this set. The price is right, and this will encourage them to keep releasing the other seasons.

At last, fans in Denmark can now also watch this great cartoon as it was ment to be seen! Our Danish public service station over here, TV2, aired the show around the same time as it ran in the UK, and unfortunatlly we  also had to put up  with the terrible versions of all of the episodes! All the need stuff and the word ninja was edited out in each and every one of them, and ""the teenage mutant ninja turtles"" were renamed  ""the teenage mutant hero turtles"", terrible! and the only glimpses we got from the first season was the 72 minute cut version ""how it all began""!
With this DVD release though, we can now enjoy this first season in it's full length with opening and end-credits included just like they should be!!
Sound and picture quality is great, although it annoys me a bit that the navigation menue does not include any animated secments or tmnt-theme music. Just the humm from my DVD-drive! Another thing which is not that great, is the inclusion of the bonus episodes. They should have waited to release these on the correct season dvd in the correct order!
