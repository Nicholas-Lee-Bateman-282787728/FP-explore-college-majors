6382217,3,B00JOTETJQ,"You get Sir Sean Connery as the villian and that's worth the price of admission alone!!  You get Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes doing passable salutes to the cheeky charm of Emma Peel and John Steed (done with impeccable aplomb in the 60's television show by Dame Diana Rigg (can you believe that) and Patrick MacNee (who turns up here).

This adaptation and kinda sorta prequel to the TV show is a mixed bag that audiences just couldn't connect with when it came out and I could see why, but still if you 'open your mind man to the colors of the sixties' and 'don't let the negative waves bring you down' you'll come away with it's sly sense of humor and parody wafting its way into your psyche.

I've have grown to love Uma Thurman over the years for her unique take on whatever role she takes on and here her Dr. (?) Emma Peel has an accent that would have made the fish jump out of the chips but is great fun.  Fiennes is ever dry in his delivery but the real treat is Sean Connery letting every Bond villian he ever encountered channel their way through his Scottish interior and come bubbling out of his huge screen personality as grandiose villiany until it isn't a profession anymore it's an act of the Gods and Connery wreaks havoc with such glee you can't help but see what fun he had!!!  I'd pay twice the asking price to see that performance up on a blu-ray screen!!!

The movie is flawed but with this kind of film the flaw can seem a seam instead of a chasm if you open your self to the fun.  Funny way to sell a movie...huh...",1399334400,2,1540,4.2714776632302405
6382218,1,B00JOTETJQ,"AVENGERS could have been great.  But no.  Totally crap.  The worst script ever devised completely wasting the amazing talents of Thurman, Finnes and Connery!  Scenes are chewed!  Lines are tossed!  Catsuits are worn!  Bowlers are thrown!  The actors appear to be dazed in the delivery of ridiculous lines of dialog.  Is it a comedy?  Is it a drama? Is it slapstick? Who knows? certainly not the director.

Do yourself a favor and watch the original series.

Then if you need something more interesting that sill holds up after all these years check out 'The Prisoner'which is still ahead of it's time.  http://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Complete-Blu-ray-Patrick-McGoohan/dp/B002C68WOG/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1398450685&sr=1-1&keywords=the+prisoner",1398384000,7,756,6.294117647058823
6382219,4,B00JOTETJQ,"Now I'm not the biggest fan of the adventures of the original AVENGERS with Patrick Macnee as the ever-posh sword-umbrella armed British secret agent John Steed, and his female counterparts, the most famous of which is Mrs. Emma Peel, who as portrayed by Dame Diana Rigg, was the 1960's epitome of strong and sexy women. I am, however, for reasons that are still unknown to me, kind of in love with this seriously flawed updating of the show as directed by Jeremiah Chechik (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION, and a lot of television, most notably episodes of BURN NOTICE) with the uber-dashing Ralph Fiennes as Steed, a kind of terribly accented Uma Thurman as Dr. Emma Peel, Sean Connery as villain August DeWinter, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw as the MOD's Mother and Father, respectively.

In the broad strokes, this film outlines the beginning of the partnership of Steed and Peel and how they come to work together to stop a madman with an unknown obsession with scientist Dr. Peel, and weather machine that threatens to destroy the world if he can't rule it. And for good measure, there's some pretty decent sexual chemistry between the two incredibly attractive leads, despite the fact that they were never love interests in the show.

The film is a very mixed bag. It has a healthy dose of throwback 60's pop psychedelia (villains wearing gigantic multi-colored teddy bear suits, huge robotic wasps), references to all sorts of British culture (e.g. a moment where Steed picks up one of the aforementioned Teddy Bear heads and says, ""Alas, poor Teddy."" to which Peel chimes in, ""I knew him, Steed""), and a general Britishness all around. The fact that it's an American director shows the film how kind of tone-deaf it can get with these moments, and how obviously Connery was close to his retirement reflects pretty terribly with his performance. The finale is so poorly shot and choreographed that it becomes unintelligible after a while.

I can see why fans of the show were so terrifically disappointed with this film, but again, I really enjoy the idiosyncracies of this film. The fact that it doesn't quite work on a number of different levels, aside from the terrific performances by Fiennes (who is PERFECT for this type of role), Broadbent and Shaw, is I think what draws me to it. It just seems so thrown together, like they had 30 subplot ideas they put into a hat and randomly pulled out four or five so they could build a film out of them. Which brings me to the casting of Eddie Izzard as the main goon for DeWinter. He has zero dialogue (except for a terrible-sounding over-dub in his last on-screen moments, and his whole presence seems like he's just there because he's British. Again, another example of how slap-dash this whole film seems.

THE AVENGERS should be viewed with some caution, but it should also be viewed to see how someone made a somewhat decent film out of a string of non-sequitors, or how to not make a potential action franchise.",1398211200,10,2979,4.778640776699029
6382220,4,B00JOTETJQ,"There is a lot of things done right in this movie, and a lot of things wrong -- but only compared to the truly fun original series. Steed, in the original was a bit heavy, more like real life and what one would expect of an officer over 40. Also, the age difference between Peel and Steed was a huge factor in the original -- nearly a generation apart and represented Old School with New Thinking. Here, that difference is cut in half and it really loses for it. Here, Steed meets Mrs. Peel while nude reading a newspaper in the steam room of a (old fashioned) gentleman private club. The series Steed was always dressed to a T. Uma certainly was thin enough to match Diana Rigg, but lacked the twinkle in her eyes. Ralph certainly went through the motions of a gentleman spy, steam rooms not withstanding.
That said, Connery's scenes certainly pull this movie back together. It has nearly all the right elements, and a good cast (minus the age and weight differences). For those of us who loved the original, it hurt in some scenes to watch... so many opportunities lost... but as a standalone movie, it really wasn't all that bad.",1424390400,3,1132,4.5

6382227,4,B00JOTETJQ,"The Avengers was a classic British television series, discovered in America when Diana Rigg became Mrs. Emma Peel.

It doesn't always succeed, but until the original series is released on Blu-Ray, those of us who are big fans of the series, will have to make do.",1415059200,,342,4.813559322033898

8652655,1,B00JOTETJQ,"...and only got worse.  I quit half-way through, and I ALWAYS finish movies.  But I unfortunately got suckered in by:
1) A great cast (Thurman, Fienes, Connery)
2) A great price point (for a blu-ray)
3) A great looking cover
4) What I had heard was a plot based on a cool old British TV spy program
5) Some artificially high reviews by people who thought they were reviewing the Marvel's ""Avengers"" movie (Iron Man, Capt. America, etc.)

But everything about this movie is awful.  The plot is a mess, scenes are silly, special effects are bad, music is awful, and even these normally solid actors fail miserably. This has nothing to do with me not having watched the old tv series, as I talked to folks who had and they hated it just as much as I did.  Even if this looks cheap, SAVE YOUR DOUGH.  It ain't worth it, and mine is going straight to my library as a donation.  Would be sad if this is the reason Connery stopped making movies.",1428624000,5,938,4.35632183908046
8652656,5,B00JOTETJQ,"Beautiful picture quality ... beautiful scenery ... I loved almost everything about this movie and that includes Sean Connery's creepy dirty-old-man role. I think Uma Thurman was mis-cast as Emma Peel, but I still feel it to be an enjoyable, gorgeously-filmed, take-me-away-for-a-few-hours movie.",1425772800,2,296,5.906976744186046
