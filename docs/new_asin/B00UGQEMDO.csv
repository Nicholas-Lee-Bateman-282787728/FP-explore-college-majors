8706515,3,B00UGQEMDO,"Hollywood in the 30s. Boys pursue beautiful wannabe starlet who is flirty, fickle, slutty. Very stylized, catchy period soundtrack, rich cinematography, and Black is beautiful. Slow moving, sensual, some humor. Good acting. Some uniquely bizarre scenes. Entertaining enough to watch, but view at the risk of becoming confused, repulsed and disappointed. [Another example of the novel being the far better choice.]",1477699200,,413,5.786885245901639
