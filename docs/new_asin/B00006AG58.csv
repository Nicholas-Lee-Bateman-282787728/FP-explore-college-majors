I have never liked the over-the-top theactrics of pro-wrestling, and expected to see some cheesey acting by ""The Rock"". However, I couldn't have been more wrong; ""The Rock"" is a surprizingly good actor! This movie had some really great action sequeances and I thought the story played out well. I'm not saying this is a ""thinking"" movie, but it is great entertainment in my opinion. The only problem I had with this movie is that is did not lead into ""The Mummy Returns"" as I expected.",1033430400,,546,4.47
