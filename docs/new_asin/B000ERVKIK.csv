8113847,2,B000ERVKIK,"The women in this film are attractive, but even they couldn't save this meandering plot. I was just bored, and halfway through the film I ended up just fast-forwarding to the sex scenes (which are okay, but not good enough to make this film worthwhile).",1459296000,,253,4.644444444444445
8113848,4,B000ERVKIK,"In this 1998 film, Jeff Davis' character, Mark, is the beneficiary of attention from 3 beautiful women, Cindy, his current girlfriend, Donna, his former fiance who is trying to win him back, and Jill, played by Amy Lindsay, who tells Mark she is gay so that she can hang around him and not be perceived as a threat to the others. Ahmo Hight also gets into the act. Lots of epidermis is on display, and Amy Lindsay fans won't be disappointed.",1386892800,,441,4.45679012345679
8113849,4,B000ERVKIK,Didn't follow the story for long.  Fast forwarded to see what was left. No Full Frontal but some beautiful women just the same! Main reason I purchased was for Ahmo Hight and she didn't disappoint! Worth owning.  Will be out of print soon.,1294444800,17,239,4.534883720930233
