What attracted me to this selection was seeing the name Robert Shaw - a favorite performer whose films include 'Jaws', 'The Deep', and 'Swashbuckler'. A swarthy man's man in the old school tradition - this guy was bad ass from the get-go. So I decided to take a chance without reading a synopsis or review.

Not bad.

Not good either. But not bad.

Tells the tale of two twin brothers Charles and Earl Hodgson - Robert Shaw playing both roles with and without an embarrassingly cheesy hairpiece.

Interestingly, the single zygote siblings detest one another. Why they then choose to live with each other is just one of many plot holes one has to issue a pass in order to proceed with the screenplay.

Earl is a renown security expert who designs ultra-secure vaults for global customers. Charles makes his living in investments. And the latter plans to take down one of the world's largest precious stone caches found in the heart of the Diamond District of Tel Aviv - a cache protected by his brother's most recent impenetrable design.

To facilitate his plan, Charles has been awaiting the release on one particular criminal who spent the last 5 years in the penitentiary. His primary skill? Custom Art Forger. (For this review I'm distilling the essence of their characters and cutting away an astounding amount of superfluous and ridiculous fluff)

Enter Archibald and Sally - couple and partners in crime. Charles has literally been watching and grooming, in the case of Barbara Hershey's character, the pair for a long while. He make them an offer. Take home their share of a multimillion dollar pot, or at the very least a $100K payday if the job goes bust. It's a deal they can't resist.

As the team enters Israel, Archie's profile, via hilariously insulting old style ASCII illustration, has been tagged by Interpol. The alert suggests that the ex-con is traveling to their country, likely to conduct some mischief. And now a street smart cop is hot on the team's trail.

Again, no point getting into the numerous plot holes and extraneous nonsensical story developments since it would require a minor thesis to examine and dismantle each one. The sheer number almost invites an MST3K lampooning.

Those negatives aside, I had an decent time watching the team make their moves toward a one-hundred million dollar pile of shiny stones. Notably, the movie played best when focused on the theft itself. Gotta love those old-school suction cups!

Movie Notes:

- Surprised to learn that this was an early Golan/Globus production. Cinephiles will remember the wacky 1980s and the infamous Cannon Group. I remember when the pair were interviewed on 60 Minutes laughing about how ""$1 million dollars was the entire budget"" for their schlock making machine - but a wildly profitable schlock machine.

This movie was done when the pair were still hands-on filmmakers; learning the business for their future half-baked productions. It came as no surprise to see this flick completed in their homeland; where their Israeli contacts essentially allowed them guerrilla filmmaker status - utilizing just about every standing set available - including the world famous Church Of The Nativity in Bethlehem.

- Just for fun, count how many times you see Barbara Hershey's naked body wrapped up in a blanket.

- This early effort reveals the foundation for The Cannon Group's trademark formula for flick production - a checklist that included: Explosions, Car Wrecks, Half Nekkid Babe, Money, and a Goofy, But Lovable, Authority Figure.

- If you look closely, toward the end of the flick, you can see a nameplate affixed next to the elevator callbox - Globus Ltd.",1414195200,,3703,4.95638126009693

The movie deals with a suave diamond dealer attempting to reveal flaws in a security system designed by his twin brother with whom he has an intense rivalry.",1394668800,,345,4.580645161290323
