3476410,5,B001AZIRYA,"If one was to buy only one episode of Bravo's ""Inside the Actor's Studio,"" then this would be the easiest decision to make.  This timeless episode is special because Robin Williams is figuratively the ""energizer bunny""; he is performing through actions, words, and gestures why he is who he is.  The interviewer, James Lipton, gives Robin Williams free reign to showcase his talent and enthralls any audience, whether it be the students in the crowd or the fans watching the DVD.  ""Humorous"" does not even scratch the surface of what this in depth analysis captures.  I would argue that if one had a friend with no sense humor, watching this is one of the few recommendations that will change them.  This interview is a ride with a high octane boost that I have watched so many times that I have stopped counting.",1236211200,3,813,4.697183098591549
3476411,4,B001AZIRYA,"Actors Studio Drama School alumnus Robin Williams was interviewed by Lipton on January 29, 2001, and the resulting episode of *Inside the Actors Studio* became one of the most popular that Bravo ever aired. In his inimitable style, Williams takes control of the evening away from his host the moment he steps onto the stage, and spends more than five hours (from which the original two-hour episode was edited) committing serial improvisation for the very entertained students. He also, when Lipton can get a word in edgewise, answers questions, discussing his childhood, different film roles and how he moved from stand-up comedy to acting.

The DVD version is extremely enjoyable. Everything that made the original broadcast episode so popular is intact, along with additional footage from Williams' live interview. It's futile to say any more about it, because Robin Williams can't be described - you just have to watch him, and repeated viewings are recommended. Sometimes he's gleefully predictable: when Lipton ingenuously asks Williams if he has an introverted side, we know exactly how Williams will respond, and we're just waiting for it. But more typically, Williams takes Lipton and us on the kind of roller-coaster ride we've come to expect from this brilliant comedian and actor.  Only two things about this DVD disappointed me.

James Lipton takes up a bit too much of the allotted time, speaking for four and half minutes at the beginning of the interview. There is a dictum among writers: ""show, don't tell."" Lipton talks at great length, needlessly describing things we're about to see in the interview, when all we, as viewers, want is to see Williams himself. Lipton's tone and demeanor toward his subjects are so reverential, he could be delivering their eulogies, a mood that the soft, somber series theme music underscores. But his respect would be better expressed by stepping aside and giving his subjects the center stage.

Along with this, I was slightly offended that the producers of the DVD saw fit to ""bleep"" Robin Williams' speech when he says something that normally couldn't be broadcast on network TV. No one expects this kind of coy caution on a commercial DVD. It's also rather absurd to bleep out individual words when much of the physical content of Williams' improvisation involves sexual humor that skirts the edges of obscene. In his introduction, Lipton promises us Robin Williams ""unleashed, uncensored [and] uncut.""  I'm sorry to say that Lipton isn't being truthful.

Despite these nuisances, *Inside the Actors Studio: Robin Williams* is well-produced and worth the price. Theatre students, teachers, and fans of Robin Williams will all enjoy and learn from this interview.  The DVD includes about 30 minutes of extra footage that didn't make it into the final episode.",1231632000,14,2815,5.146608315098468
3476412,4,B001AZIRYA,"This was an amazing interview, and the small amount of extras they showed were fantastic.  However, they admit that they took 5 hours of Robin Williams, and condensed it into 2.5 hours for this dvd.  I want my other 2.5-3 hours of Robin.  Amazingly, they also cut out the part I remember seeing on tv, where Robin talks about his friendship with Christopher Reeve.  This was very strange.

Overall, it was excellent, hence 4 out of 5 stars.  If they come out with an extended version, buy that one instead.",1231200000,26,506,4.566666666666666

3476415,4,B001AZIRYA,I love the entire series but I think that this may be one of the crowning moments. There are a lot of great interviews but Robin Williams steals the show and really lets us know why he's one of the greatest comedic performers today. If you don't like to laugh don't watch this. I was laughing out loud the entire time since Robin Williams took the stage. If you don't like this episode it's a simple fact that you don't like Robin Williams' comedy. This is a must see for anyone that loves hilarious improv. I'm definitely getting this.,1220400000,9,536,4.424242424242424
3476416,4,B001AZIRYA,"One part of the interview which stands out for me, is when Robin took a scarf from a female audience member, and used it as a prop to make many hilarious examples of his amazingly quick improvisational talent.  Known for his lightning fast wit, he still surprised my family with how many different examples he could come up with, for how the scarf could be used to make so many jokes.  Robin's talent *was* the interview, not answering many questions; although he did answer as many as he could before he had to give in to the lure of having an audience ready & willing to enjoy his humor!

James Lipton knew going in that he was going to have a challenge keeping Robin answering questions, lol!  But Robin did show the process of how he used & utilized his talent, and it was a highly entertaining and interesting interview which I will never forget.",1220313600,12,851,4.470967741935484
3476417,2,B001AZIRYA,"I Agree, would have ordered this,but at only 50 minutes long there is a lot missing-I understand the interview actually lasted 4 hours long and thay edited down to 2 hours for Bravo.",1216944000,5,182,4.545454545454546
3476418,4,B001AZIRYA,"I had originally given this product a single star because the technical data showed a run time of only 50 minutes. However, it looks like Amazon goofed (thankfully, not me!), and it now shows double that time (well, almost!) which look like it gives the full two-hour interview showed on Bravo.  Also, there are two hidden bonus tracks - ""James Lipton: Flashbacks"" and ""Great Moments That Didn't Make The Cut"".  I'm hoping the latter shows the poor shmoe who laughed himself right into an ambulance (hernia, don'tchaknow).  And no, it's not the fat lady in the front row - the hernia victim was male.

When you watch, feel deep pity for poor James Lipton. I mean, he's a serious guy, and he's pitted against the Fastest Comedy Brain in the West. He shows his frustration only once, to the delight of both Mr. Williams and the audience.  Williams DOES occasionally give a straight answer (and not a straight line), otherwise you'd think he needs a straight jacket. When he's serious, you can still see the twinkle in his eye. When he's NOT serious (which is most of the time), you'll swear you can see smoke curling out of his ears as the gears in his head grind at warp speed.

The only way this could have five stars is if they showed all four hours of his antics, completely uncut.  That said, I'm still pre-ordering it!",1216771200,41,1322,4.576271186440678

My tip: Watch some other Inside Actors Studio shows first (such as Robert Downey jr., Johnny Depp or Charlize Theron) and then watch this one with Robin Williams. Why? Because it is so different from the other shows. I can't tell you much more because it would spoil it (a little). But follow my tip and you won't regret it!",1435795200,,400,4.493150684931507

3476583,5,B001AZIRYA,Robin Williams at his best.  His candid comments are interspersed with inspired bits of comedy that camp anions his comments.  If you look carefully at his responses you can catch the flavour of his sadness and his compulsion to need to slip into comedic bits in order to protect his inner core of beliefs.  He manages to make everyone laugh but in doing so he distances himself from the crowd by slipping into another comedic character to avoid revealing more of himself.  He is brilliant at improvisation but is it the mechanism by which he avoids showing more of his own thoughts and emotions?  He was truly a giant of World comedy.  This DVD is a wonderful way to remember his genius and his vulnerabilities.  I commend this DVD to all who loved his comedy.  Hopefully there will be more releases of his other performances,1425427200,2,826,4.6482758620689655

3476671,5,B001AZIRYA,"This was an actual teaching session. The people in the audience were studying to be actors, directors and the like. Williams chose to show not tell when he was asked most questions. The interviewer, Lipton, had these little blue cards to ask him the standard questions. Williams was polite about that but he didn't let those stand in his way. It would just take a second or two and he would take that question and create something on the spot with it.  One question was whether he was really an introvert. His whole face and demeanor changed into that of an withdrawn, shy, introverted person. He expanded it some so we saw a little bit of torture. Then he abruptly dropped the whole thing, turned back into a person being interviewed and said, ""Yes."" He did the entire show in this fashion which was to show the students how it is done rather than sitting there and answering questions.

I just read this week online that Williams was a lot more ill than previously known. He was experiencing both dementia and paranoia. He had been declining for three years with either Parkinson's or a brain disorder which looked like Parkinson's. This was an amazingly cruel fate for him. To have a brain like his and have it start to attack you as you entered your sixth decade is just so incredibly awful. You see that brain fully operational here and I am glad he is no longer in torment. He does seem to have been an amazingly giving person, especially for someone in show business, judging by how he gave his all for these students.

Recorded some three years preceding the time of this review, there was nothing so important that it was erased from the cable system's provided DVR . . . until that DVR ""died"" suddenly.

Fortunately, Inside The Actor's Studio had released a DVD of the show and, best of all, included those portions of the show that hit the floor in the process of reducing it to fit a TV timeslot.

Today, it's the best-selling Inside The Actor's Studio, yet. And there is good reason: It is Robin Williams personified. It is his improvisational want at its best. It is Robin Williams.",1414454400,,824,4.708333333333333

I am also glad, however, that I am familiar with his fabulous other roles such as ""Dead Poet Society"" , ""Patch Adams"", ""Goodwill Hunting"", ""Mrs. Doubfire"", and others, which show his humanity.  Taken all together, this interview adds to understanding how a brilliant mind like this works.",1402444800,,564,5.0978260869565215
3476813,5,B001AZIRYA,"With a thorough description of the significance of the episode prior to the first moment of the show it's a most worthwhile viewing experience. Watch the first 7 minutes and you'll be hooked and stay to the end. I never knew so much about ""Popeye"" or ""Mork"". I laughed, but I was so truly and seriously impressed by the level of detail and fact-revealing questions and answers.

View it in 20 or 30 minute increments to appreciate the near 2 hours because the last 45 minutes disappears fast because it's a constant dose of humorous material with absolute hilarity. Robin Williams can be traced to so many places Christopher Reeve, NYC comedy stages, great directors like Barry Levinson, Steven Spielberg, Penny Marshall, or Mike Nichols.

Pure delight! 4 and 1/2 to 5 Stars for sure!

Don't miss the bonus features!

We first saw this example of Robin Williams' off the cuff, crazy wackiness on Bravo when they were still broadcasting Inside the Actors Studio, and were so bummed that we didn't own a DVR at the time. This is the extended version of his appearance with James Lipton in front of a class of Drama, Theatre & Film Students at The New School in New York City. Such a treat to see him be his manic best, coupled with moments of true confessions and almost sobering moments. We laughed until we cried and then laughed some more. Someone in the audience guffawed themselves into the ER. So yes, it's funny, brilliant, charming and worth owning if you are a classic Williams fan.",1389916800,3,758,4.421428571428572

3476824,5,B001AZIRYA,"The long running ""Inside The Actors Studio"" is usually a sober minded program where actors discuss their craft.  Host James Lipton's goal is for the students of the famed theatre program gain insight from those who are presently practicing their craft.  However, when Robin Williams appeared on ""ITAS,"" chaos was the order of the day.  Mr. Williams' episode became the first two hour episode of the series and that was achieved only by cutting literally hours of material down.  Mr. Lipton is often reduced to utter helplessness as Academy Award winner gives his audience a performance they will never forget.  This DVD is guaranteed to leave you laughing so hard your eyes will tear, your nose will run and your sides will ache.  It is Robin Williams at his most manic and a laugh maker from beginning to end.",1345075200,,810,4.7913669064748206
3476825,5,B001AZIRYA,"Seems I'm not alone in loving Robin Williams. The audience was packed, and the host told us that one person laughed so hard he burst a hernia and had to be taken out in an ambulance. I'm not surprised. Dozens of voices, odd characters, strange movements, and virtually everything improvised. The host managed to get in a few serious questions, but Williams' answers were more in the way of demonstrations than explanations. For example, in pointing out that almost anything can provide inspiration, he borrowed a pink scarf or shawl from a lady in the front row and did about ten minutes of using that piece of fabric with fringes on the two short ends to be just about anything he wanted.

The most serious part is at the end, when the students ask him questions directly. It becomes clear that Williams cares deeply about their talents and their dreams. A joy to watch all the way through an episode about twice the length of the Johnny Depp episode (which I also reviewed).",1336867200,,976,4.641618497109826

He is absolutely uncontrollable, he can't even control himself. The thing I loved most, is unlike his stand-up routines, there isn't an f-bomb being thrown out every other minute. He hardly swears, which was almost like seeing a NEW Robin. I adore this DVD, it is absolute gold. This man is a genius.
Like James Lipton said, trying to categorize Robin is like trying to catch lightning with a butterfly net.",1335744000,,568,4.524271844660194

3476828,3,B001AZIRYA,"I had saved this show with my DVR and was hoping that the DVD would have included all five hours of the interview, but it did not. All the DVD contains is the two-hour, edited-for-TV interview plus a dozen or so edited out footage in separate segments.",1303344000,5,252,4.382978723404255
3476829,4,B001AZIRYA,"""Inside the Actor's Studio"" is pretty straightforward: James Lipton interviews actors with important questions, and nothing is over-stylized with MTV music or clever camera angles. It's rare to see an episode where it just turns wild. This particular episode with Robin Williams is different from most episodes because it's so humorous. Sometimes Lipton would have to wait in order to ask the next question because Robin's answers are filled with unexpected improvisations. In fact, the first question is delayed just because Robin can't stop joking around with both Lipton and the audience. There is one audience member who simply cannot stop laughing because Robin just won't stop with the hilarious jokes (I have to admit, though, that her laugh is a bit distracting from beginning to end). This episode is still worthy of watching straight through, because there's a lot of insight on where and how all this comedy originated, and how he is able to improvise so quickly. It's a fascinating episode, and it's a must-see for all Robin Williams fans.

NOTE: The original episode ran for about four hours, but this DVD has only one hundred minutes worth of footage. Maybe in the future, we'll be able to see the entire interview, but for now, a hundred minutes is enough.

3476830,4,B001AZIRYA,"Whenever Robin Williams is on a talk show or doing an interview, don't expect the normal routine. Williams goes off on so many tangents that it could drive the interviewer crazy!

On ""Inside the Actors Studio"" Robin Williams does not hold anything back. James Lipton had trouble asking him 3 questions in the span of 30 minutes. For a lot of people, this would be a bad thing, as they would start to get annoying. However, this is what Robin Williams does best. He is hilarious when nothing is scripted.

If you are a fan of the Robin Williams style of comedy, you should enjoy this interview.",1281052800,,593,4.5327102803738315
3476831,5,B001AZIRYA,"This was an impulse purchase, and I will never regret it.

Every time I watched this on TV I just couldn't stop laughing.

Now I have it to laugh all day long, which is the greatest feeling in the world.",1275091200,,203,4.05
3476832,5,B001AZIRYA,i could not stop laughing. robin is a comedic genius. his brain was in overdrive. i watched this on tv once and had to have it to watch over and over again. there is no other in his class.,1264809600,,188,3.8461538461538463
3476833,5,B001AZIRYA,"I just recently saw Robin Williams in concert back in October.  It was so much fun!  Ever since then, I've been seeing a lot of his movies on cable. I've seen this interview before on the Bravo network on cable. I never knew it was on DVD. When Robin Williams is being interviewed, you know you will not be bored.  He had the audience in the theater laughing almost the entire time.  It's fun to hear his side when he's talking about his family, the movies he's made, his life growing up, the schooling he had before he went into the entertaiment buisness.  During the interview, he does a lot of stand-up.  It keeps the inverview fun.  The man is a comic genius!!  It's funny to know when he was in high school he was voted ""funniest person,"" but also voted ""least likely to succeed.""  So much they know!  Ha! I would recomend this dvd to anyone who is a Robin Williams fan, or even if you're not.  If you want a good laugh, he will keep you in stitches!",1257638400,,955,4.25
3476834,4,B001AZIRYA,"Well Robin may come off at times as an attention seeking coked out spazz, but there are many moments of comic genius to make this worth purchasing and watching more than once. The improvised bit Robin does where he takes questions from the audience is almost worth the purchase price alone. And interviewer James Lipton does manage to get a few questions in edgewise so you do get some insight into Robin Williams the man. Though don't expect any sort of Oprah-like soul baring, just sit back and prepare to laugh. The guy's a mile a second, not everything sticks but there's enough that does to be thoroughly entertaining.",1248480000,,623,4.724770642201835
3476835,5,B001AZIRYA,I have seen this show several times and I still laugh at Robin's humor and the reactions he gets. In these hard times there is not much to laugh at. I find this show is good therapy for sad and hard times. Laughter will make you forget your problems for a while and it will not effect you like alcohol or drugs. I would recommend this show for a good laugh.,1243555200,5,357,4.042253521126761
3476836,5,B001AZIRYA,"What can anyone say about the possibly best comic genius of the generation? His improv is second to none.
If, by some twisted sense of reality, you dislike Robin's genius, the reaction of the female in the audience makes watching this interview all worthwhile!",1239494400,,260,4.931818181818182
3476837,5,B001AZIRYA,"Robin Williams is a complete genius.  For those (and there are not that many) whom are amazing at whatever it is they do, I am in awe.  Robin is one of these select individuals.  This ""interview"" (if that is an appropriate catagorization) not only displays his ability to quickly have improve that is unique and hilarious, yet it also gets into who he is and how he has gotten to where he is today.  My cheeks hurt from laughing/smiling so much.",1237939200,,445,4.45679012345679

8280618,3,B001AZIRYA,"Robin Williams has an incredible mind and the filming was intimate and immensely enjoyable. Unfortunately, the DVD itself had numerous errors causing glitches throughout three sections. It makes me wonder if they are reselling used media or just poor media.",1504483200,,257,5.45
