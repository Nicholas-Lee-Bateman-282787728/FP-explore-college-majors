494311,3,6302689724,"a well made and documented film,on the battle of isandlawaler.not big on plot,but great battle footage .the fact that a well armed british army lost against zulu soldiers ,with nothing more than spears ,alone .makes this film a great watch.not as much fun as zulu but far more acurate.the 24th foot became the south wales border regiment after this battle.the regiment,s flags or [ colours ] having been sent back to england,to be blessed by victoria .if you have never seen this film or zulu 'see this one first .then zulu as the film zulu documents the battle of rorkes drift ,which took place the next day",1034035200,,608,4.691588785046729
494312,5,6302689724,"After I saw this film I read ""The Washing of the Spears, The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation"" - from that it became clear that, while I am sure there are some details wrong, the portrayal in this film is very close to all the things that really happened.  The splitting of the forces in enemy territory, the failure to laager the wagons, the lack of tools to open the ammunition boxes - including many of the details of the characters that were portrayed.
An infinitely better movie than Zulu - I wish The History Channel would take to showing this.  Some great lines too - ""Come all this bloody way to be killed by a bullett from Birmingham"" - ""It seems Puleen has a battle on his hands"" - ""My, what an adventure we are on""
Cinemax showed this about fifty times one year in the early 80's. Haven't seen it on TV since.  I think it is one of the best war movies ever made with its focus on strategy, execution, and surprise.",995760000,13,925,4.214689265536723
494313,5,6302689724,"This is a more than a fair representation of the British colonial  presumptions and arrogance existing during the reign of Queen Vistoria and before. England's ignorance of the Zulu potential to wage effective war against a modern army of that time is most evident and their blunders, both on a  diplomatic and military basis are compelling to watch.  It is a superlative film in everyway. The cast is at it's  very best and the photography is stunning.  This film and Zulu ( 1964) should be in every film and history buffs collection.  It is a crying shame that this is not readily available or released in DVD.",994291200,12,612,4.672897196261682
494314,5,6302689724,"I highly recommend this movie to all war or history buffs. This movie is based on the true story of the Battle of Isandlwana in south Africa .The battle was fought on Jan. 22nd 1879 between the 24th regiment under the command of Lt. Gen. Lord Chelmsford and the Zulu nation under King Cetshwayo. To make a long story short, The Zulus crushed and wiped out the entire British regiment largely in part because they outnumbered the British 24,000 to about 1,500, but also due to British arrogance(Which is pointed out time and time again in this movie)and the lack of respect and where abouts of the enemy. An allstar cast including Peter O'toole and Burt Lancaster Star in this Classic. The only Bad thing about this movie is that it is no longer in print, which to me is a real travesty, considering all the garbage that was made that still is in print. In fact i had to buy this movie off an online auction. I hope that the Movie Company that made this Great film comes to it's senses and Redistributes this movie so that it can be enjoyed on DVD as well.",992736000,60,1055,4.387755102040816
494315,4,6302689724,"ZULU DAWN is a superb companion film to the classic ZULU, particularly since both films were written by the same man, Cy Enfield.  ZULU DAWN climaxes with the Battle of Isandhlwana, which immediately preceded the Battle of Rorke's Drift, accurately portrayed in ZULU.  While the Battle of Isandhlana is important, the real significance of ZULU DAWN lies in its revelation of how the British governor of South Africa orchestrated the war against the Zulu.  Moreover, the British governor, Sir Henry Bartle-Frere, acted against the wishes of Queen Victoria and Parliament, resulting in the bloody defeat and near annihilation of the British 24th Regiment of Foot at Isandhlwana.  The arrogance and carelessness of the British is shocking and the humiliating defeat of the British army in South Africa strikes the viewer as completely justified. The fact that good copies of ZULU are hard to find is pitiful enough, but the unavailability of ZULU DAWN is a real tragedy.  It's extremely difficult to rent; it's been out of print so long that most recent video rental establishments have never been able to acquire it.  I myself have only encountered two copies for sale ever, and I bought both of them (one went to my uncle, who turned me on to ZULU DAWN in the first place). Keep an eye out for ZULU DAWN in used video stores and exchange shops.",977097600,48,1343,4.868421052631579

I like historical movies. this seems to have been well made. the Zulu won because of their sheer numbers and because the British were too confident for their own good. they apparently didn't pay attention the bullhead formation that the Zulu used. It is also  too bad they didn't use the Winchester rifle and  the colt  revolver if it was available was available to them.those single shot rifles just didn't cut it. In Zulu they a t least listened to their adviser,and did better. and maybe England had no right to order these people around like that anyway. this is Their home !",1483747200,,736,4.734375

494733,5,6302689724,"With a cast of thousands, well known actors in lead roles and a story that shows in detail the arrogant attitude of the British in South Africa this film fairly accurately depicts the plight of the common soldier, both in the King's army and in Cetshwayo's army. Peter O'Toole personifies the disdain that general officers at the time had for native fighters. So much disdain that he split his forces without knowing the disposition of the enemy (breaking one of the cardinal rules of warfare). The esprit of the British soldiers, fighting to the last man and last bullet is accurately portrayed, but is somewhat difficult to watch this not-so-happy ending. If, on the other hand, you enjoy seeing the British get their comeuppance for having such disdain for fighters that are willing to go up against rifles and cannon with only spears and shields then you will enjoy the film.",1478131200,2,879,4.827814569536423

The possibility of censorship exists:  Zulu Dawn presents the Colonial British as the bad guys, and historically it is far more complicated that that.  The sequel presents the brother of the Zulu king as viciously attacking a heroic band of British soldiers and it includes the fact that the Zulu subjugated other tribes in the building of the Zulu Empire, which was far more vicious than even the usual PC mischaracterizations of the British Empire.

494918,5,6302689724,"This film, though made some 15 years later is of course a prequel to the
1964 classic 'Zulu'
The Governor of the British Colony of 'Natal' declares war on the 'Zulu'
nation after a series of ultimatums are rejected by the 'Zulu' King.
The 'Natal' garrison lead by 'Lord Chelmsford' are ordered to move upon
the Zulu territory in some numbers.
The threat posed by the 'Zulu' warriors is grossly under-estimated by 'Lord
Chelmsford' who despite good intelligence splits his force, a large column
led by him move east to 'Kings Kraal' to supposedly engage the 'Zulu's'
while leaving a force of around 1500 (1200 regulars plus African recruits
and equipment carriers) at 'Isandlwana' where the 'Zulu' warriors as
reported really are closing in on.
The British force are overwhelmed by around 25000 Zulu warriors, a crushing
defeat.
The arrogance of the British was more than evident, it wasn't thought that
a force of spear-carrying warriors could defeat a well trained British force in
that way.
'Lord Chelmsford' had made a catastrophic error of judgement, he had brushed
aside the intelligence he had been given.
The defeat sent shock-waves throughout the Empire.
After their victory at 'Isandlwana' the 'Zulu's' turned their attention to 'Rorke's Drift'
a mission post defended by around 100 or so British Soldiers.
The film has a really lengthy sequence of the battle at 'Isandlwana'
A really good film with a terrific cast-list on board which includes....'Burt Lancaster'
'Simon Ward' 'Peter O'Toole' and 'Bob Hoskins'
The picture quality is superior to that of DVD.
Worth owning both this and the 1964 'Zulu'

495072,5,6302689724,"As war films go, it's pretty good. The Zulu War of 1879 was a completely unjust war started by British politicians and mining interests. This film follows Peter O'Toole's Lord Chelmsford as he leads the last scarlet coated British army to war. Bob Hoskins, Denholm Elliot and Burt Lancaster are the main stars in this film. The detail is very good, even the guns used look authentic to the period. The film covers the invasion up to the battle of Isandlwana. The film is sympathetic to the Zulu cause, but the majority of the time it is a battle flick. Exciting film, full of action, and reasonably accurate. Probably one of the best historical war films made.",1456444800,,660,4.64957264957265

Picture, sound and features playback is superb. A brilliant prequel to the classic movie Zulu (1964), and starring Burt Lancaster, Peter O'Toole, Simon Ward and Bob Hoskins, focuses on the disasterous blunder and eventual bloody engagement at Islanwanda, South Africa on January 22nd 1879, which brought about the downfall of Benjamin Disraeli's government, is a spectacle in itself. With stirring performances from a superbly assembled cast, a great script and superbly crafted battle sequences and a memorable music score, makes this two disc Blu-Ray/DVD Combo movie a must have to own.

495281,5,6302689724,"This film should have been produced first as the battle happened before the fight at Rorke's Drift occurred.  But it wasn't, but I had to add it to my British military movie collection.  Unfortunately, there were some glaring inaccuracies such as the Other Ranks or enlisted troops wore
non-wool uniform tunics and several of the infantry defending the camp were armed with carbines instead of the Martini-Henry Mk II, cal. 450 rifle instead of either the cavalry or artillery carbine.  Also, in both ""Zulu"" and ""Zulu Dawn,"" the officers were armed with the Webley Mk VI  .455 revolver instead of the Webly and Adams Mk III, same caliber.  I took some of these negative criticism I found on the internet.  For people who are really into military films, it's hard to fool them when incorrect weapons, uniforms and equipment like tanks or planes are used.  Collectors and historians notice this.  For example, in the film ""Zulu,""  produced in 1963 and giving Michael Caine his first big break in a major motion picture, some of the defending British infantry can be seen using the Lee-Metford bolt action rifles!  Also in the film, even though the enlisted men are wearing wool tunics, the facing color on the collars and arms are blue and not green in color as by the uniform regulations for this Welsh regiment of foot (infantry).  I've always said that if a producer/director is going to make a military movie based on historical fact, get it right or forget doing it.  People, such as myself, look for accuracy in the areas mentioned above.",1442793600,,1542,4.799242424242424

495692,3,6302689724,"Regarding the newest US Blu-ray release of ZULU DAWN, I think it's better than previous US DVD versions.

Agree with Lees' review of the French DVD release [""L'Ultime Attaque""]---picture quality is superb, and its run-time of 117 min. is closer to the original 121 min uncut version than the US 113 min release. Unfortunately, a number of reviewers can't make the same claim about the 117 min French Blu-ray version---too bad, because again, we're stuck with only a 113 min. US Blu-ray...

Keep hoping a decent uncut Blu-ray transfer will come out some day soon---good luck with that! In the meantime, ""L'Ultime Attaque"" DVD seems to be the best way to go for now in terms of transfer quality and run-time, if your machine can play Region 2....",1406851200,4,744,4.8046875

They used strategy, they had spies, they disseminated misinformation to the enemy. The British finally defeated them by burning their crops and starving them. After the peace agreement was signed, they were the best of allies and neither side broke the agreement.

""Zulu Dawn"" presents a much truer picture than the one-sided ""Zulu"". The British had overwhelming superiority in fire power, but were outclassed by the Zulu's superior strategy, getting the British to split their forces, for example.

I was also very pleasently surprised at how well the storyline intertwined both the global politics of the times, along with many operational protocals of the 19th centurey British Army.  One, very obvious detail, that was in effect at the time of the battle, contibuted the the disasterus results.  The critical supply of ammunition to the frontline troops facing the much larger enemy force, was extremely limited by two factors.  First, was the 'system' used to controll and account for, every round of ammunition issued.  Supply sargeants could 'only' issue rounds to members of their own company.  Secondly, this slowdown was further affected by the 'packageing' of the ammountion.  Loose rounds were stored in heavy woooden boxes tightly screwed down for transportation and protection from the elements. This 'supply issue' contributed directley to the worst defeat ever suffered by the British Army at the hands of a 'native' enemy.  (I strongley recommend Zula Dawn's 'sister film' ZULU, depicting a smaller battle which occurred at Rorks Drift, immediatley following the defeat.

495941,4,6302689724,"From the outset, I have to admit that ""Zulu,"" is one of my favorite films.  No matter how hard I try to be objective, my review of ""Zulu Dawn,"" is colored by Endfield's first film of the Zulu War.  But I have watched ""Zulu Dawn"" several times over the years, and it is a worthy effort.

The positive: The depiction of the Battle of Isandhlwana.  As with other colonial battles that had few or no survivors on the British side, there is and probably ever will be debate about ""what happened"" and ""who was to blame.""  Endfield's great strength is in letting the battle tell its own story, and including respectful but not hero-worshipping characterizations of the combatants.  While I strongly suspect that the Zulu organization and command and control was better than what we see, that's a minor point. Endfield does depict the well known theory that the British lines ran short of ammunition.  He also accurately shows how overextended the lines were.  If Puillene had ""lagered"" as the Boers did at Blood River and Chard did (almost by default) at Rorke's Drift, the battle might have turned out very differently.

The negative: The lead up to the battle paints the Brits just a shade too black, in my opinion.  Arrogance and hubris there seems to have been in plenty, but I also suspect there was a leavening of just plain stupidity and abysmally poor management thrown in.  How that could have been captured, I am not entirely sure, but more depth in the characterization of key players like Chelmsford would have made this an even better movie.  When you have Peter O'Toole available, do something more with him!

The movie is not only worth watching, it has a place in any collection of films about the British Empire.  Depicting a battle in writing, let alone on film, is daunting-- recall Wellington's words likening it to trying to write the history of a ball. Endfield comes closer to catching an historic battle on film-- in its entirety-- than any other work that I am aware of.

Two minor points: I wish we had been shown the ultimate fate of the fictional Lieutenant Vereker.  I like to think that he got away.  And ""the end of a great dynasty,"" referred to at the end of the film has nothing to do with the British Empire.  Disraeli was speaking of the death of the last lineal male descendant of Napoleon Bonaparte in a skirmish during the war.",1374451200,4,2358,4.627403846153846

495945,4,6302689724,"This movie is considered a prequel to the classic and great movie Zulu.  There is an all star cast in this DVD which includes Burt Lancaster, Peter O'Toole, Simon Ward and Bob Hoskins.  The story is based on a factual incident in history about the conflict between the British and the Zulu nation.

In January of 1879 the arrogant British offcials sent a message to the Zulu King demanding the King change his policies.  The King refused to give in to the British official.  The British were confident that their superior fire power and military experience would easily beat the Zulus.  Needless to say, they were dead wrong.  They encountered 25,000 angry Zulus and the British soldiers were slaughtered, causing this historical defeat for the British military.

One of the interesting things about this film is that 13,000 actual Zulu warriors were used in the making of this historic movie.  The movie started out a little slow but it was not long before the British crossed the river and engaged the Zulu.  I liked the movie Zulu better, but this one (Zulu Dawn) is also very memorable and well worth viewing.

In conclusion, if you are a history buff and enjoy good solid military movies, you may want to check out this one.

Historical drama of the worst defeat of a 'modern' army at the hands of a native army.  Good drama.  In the US few have heard of the battle of Isandlawana.  Not so in England.  It makes Custer's Last Stand look small by comparison.  This is a good historical recreation of the events leading up to and the hard-to-watch decisions that leave over 1200 solders facing 50,000 Zulu warriors.  This movie does a decent job of not demonizing either side but of showing this as a practically enevitable clash between competing cultures as different from one another as can possibly be.  Fortuantely no one has ever made a movie of the British retribution that followed this battle.

496011,5,6302689724,"For some reason many of the reviews of earlier DVD versions of ""Zulu Dawn"" are appearing on this page. Those reviews are accurate FOR THOSE EDITIONS.  However, this DVD/Blu-Ray combo is the real deal. The film is in its original widescreen aspect ratio and it looks great on a widescreen TV, a pretty good transfer with beautiful color for the sweeping battle scenes. My only quibble: volume seems awfully low, and I had to crank it up to hear properly.

""Zulu Dawn"" chronicles the vents leading up to Lord Chelmsford's ill-fated expedition into Zululand where 20,000 Zulus overwhelmed a poorly situated garrison of British troops on the slopes of Ishandlawana hill. The film is a prequel to the classic ""Zulu"", which depicts the battle of Rorke's Drift that took place later that same day. (These two films make for an awesome double feature.)

While this film never achieves the artistry of ""Zulu"" (which is visually stunning and properly regarded as a classic.) it is a well-paced, well-produced epic in its own right. Unlike ""Zulu"", this film sticks pretty close to the historical events and some of it was filmed at actual locations. And, whereas ""Zulu"" used visual tricks to create the impression of massed Zulu armies, this film went the full nine yards, employing the venerable ""cast of thousands"" for the sort of spectacle that is too expensive to do today, unless it is computer generated, which never looks the same. Tremendous cast of top British actors and Burt Lancaster.

Recommend watching this before ""Zulu"". For younger viewers, be aware that while this 1979 film has a modern pace, ""Zulu"" was produced in the early 1960's and has a rather leisurely build up to the actual attack as it sets up its situation and characters. The action sequences make it well worth the wait.",1367539200,17,1791,4.881578947368421

Frankly, I had given-up hope on ever seeing ""Zulu Dawn"" transferred to blu-ray. Amazingly, it here and although it's still the poorer step-child to the magnficently restored ""Zulu"", this prequel is still very good, and well-worth acquiring.

I'm not a geek, but I though other viewers might appreciate to read what the experts on blu-ray releases have to say about this particular title. Now, perhaps, my other wish that someday ""Khartoum"" and ""55 Days at Peking"" might make their blu-ray debut before my eyes are too weak to appreciate the gift!

""Zulu Dawn is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Severin Films with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 2.35:1 (this may mean that Severin has finally forsaken the older MPEG-2 codec for its Blu-ray releases). Severin is touting this as having been restored, and it must be admitted that the elements are in remarkably good condition overall, with one notable exception. Several times throughout the film there are what appear to be a missing frame, leading to just very slight jumps in the fluidity of the motion. It's really noticeable in the clips in the main The History of the Zulu Wars featurette included as a supplement, and at times almost looks like what you see when a PAL source has been converted to NTSC. That anomaly aside, this is really a rather nice looking high definition presentation. My hunch is there has been some noise reduction applied to this release, but there is definitely fine grain (as in fine grain) noticeable when the film is in motion, especially in the many outdoor scenes where it's quite visible in the skies. Colors are nicely robust (if the reds are just slightly on the orange side, as the screenshots accompanying this review show) and fine detail pops quite well in close-ups.

Severin Films is still getting its feet wet in the Blu-ray market and it's a good sign that this release has a lossless audio option. Both a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono mix as well as a Dolby Digital 2.0 (mono) mix are included on this Blu-ray. The lossless track sounds very good indeed, with dialogue clean (if sometimes a bit hard to decipher due to the accents) and Elmer Bernstein's exciting score well rendered. Anyone who is a fan of Bernstein's amazing work in Hawaii knows how well the composer utilizes ethnic instruments (especially percussion) and voices, and he does much the same thing in this film. While this track is obviously narrow, it has some requisite dynamic range, especially in several key action sequences.

* The History of the Zulu Wars (1080p; 25:34) is a really interesting documentary featuring Ian Knight, author of Zulu Rising - The Epic Story of Isanlwana and Rorke's Drift, who provides a wealth of background information and context that really helps the viewer to better appreciate some of the finer details of the film.
* Recreating the War (480i; 20:19) looks back on the historical accuracy of the film, and includes interviews with Midge Carter (a male), who was the
 historical advisor.
* A Visit to the Battlefield (480i; 16:47) features Ian Knight again, taking us on a little guided tour of the actual historical locations.
* Theatrical Trailer (480i; 3:00)
* Outtakes (480i; 12:14). These are in pretty poor shape, image wise, but they're fascinating to watch as they show director Douglas Hickox in action. """,1366934400,13,3903,5.350162866449511

To get a Blu-Ray as well seemed like all my Christmasses had come at once. That is until I put both the discs into my Blu-Ray and DVD players.

On the positive side, the picture seems pretty good and is in the correct 1:2.35 aspect ratio. The Blu-Ray is also region free and will play on Region B Blu-Ray players.

Now the bad news. The audio is poor, shockingly poor. In fact, I would go far to say that it is abysmal (and possible the worst I have ever come across - and I have a lot of DVDs and Blu-Rays). You have the choice of either Dolby Digital Mono or DTS HD Mono. Neither is worth bothering with. I wasn't expecting an upgraded sound mix but the sound level on the soundtrack is terrible. The volume is low and Elmer Bernstein's great score is barely audible and often drowned out by the sound effects. The DVD is the same so the problem is not with the Blu-Ray in itself. It seems as this is the way the film was transferred onto both the DVD and the Blu-Ray. Being in possession of a French Region 2 DVD with a mono soundtrack, I know that the original film does sound much better than it does here (this is clearly a very bad transfer). Still, I've just discovered a Region B Blu-Ray available from Amazon Germany and have just ordered that. Hopefully it will be better.

Nevertheless, the film is firmly about the British and features endless scenes of British soldiers riding about aimlessly on horseback accompanied by a score of martial music.  After we find out why the Zulus will fight the British (invasion of sovereignty and so they can get back to their harvest) there is no more psychological contact made with the Africans.

496134,4,6302689724,"This is an epic in the classic sense. Lots of bodies. Huge outdoor locations. Gargantuan battle scenes with copious amounts of blood. What's not to like?

Here's the scoop. The Brits are in Africa. They want to not only inhabit, they want to rule, so they are going to impose their will on the Zulu and ask them to step down for no real reason. The Zulu king figures the Brits wouldn't do it if he asked so why should he? So they go toe to toe with some devastating results for the Brits.

This was a real chapter in history and it feels as though they stuck close to the general way things actually happened. The Brits are depicted as racist and stodgy. They are trying to bring England to Africa. They are too organized for this circumstance. The Zulu seem to be doing just fine. They're predominantly farmers who are able to feed themselves and they have an organized society. The Brits are the intruders. Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) is pompous and figures there is no way he can be beat by these savages. As a result he doesn't think things through well enough and ends up making poor decisions in regard to strategy. The Zulu hand the Brits the defeat of all time.

This is a cool flick in the classic sense. The set up and execution seem right out of the manual. The characters are written well enough (some needed more filling out) and the Zulu aren't made to appear less than human. They're smart and brave. Good use is made of location and the acting is steady. Almost every actor you've ever seen in any British movie is here. This is a solid effort all the way around. Unfortunately, it seems this was a straight film to DVD transfer with no enhancements. The picture quality is decent enough but the sound is awful. I had to crank this puppy way up and much of the dialogue was still unintelligible.

I had not seen the film before purchasing but I love the outstanding film ""ZULU"".  So for that reason alone I ordered it.  The film itself gets 3-stars.  The transfer (from celluloid to DVD) gets a Zero.  The quality of picture is poor - very poor.  It is actually painful to watch on a big screen TV!  Other reviews site how much of the original frame is lost.  I don't know all the technical aspect but I don't doubt that they must be correct.
As I stated before, the movie itself gets only three stars.  I believe the Producers and Directors must have watched the ""original"" Stanley Baker ZULU (battle at Rorke's Drift) and then left directly to shoot this film.  It is a poor imitation.  The movie even starts the same way with Zulu dance and song and a brutal death of a Zulu warrior on the King's whim.  The missionary's not there but he shows up soon after.  And believe me, there no comparison to any actor in this film to the job the young Michael Caine accomplished in the earlier film.  Bob Haskins is a good actor but his role as a Sergeant pales in comparison to Nigel Green as the indefatigable ""Colour Sergeant Bourne"" -- a solider I felt I would follow anywhere after watching in the first film!  Eventually the film gets ""going"" and the battle scenes that follow are good.  As it was shot before CGI it is great to know that every person shown in the battle was really there on the set.
Comparing the two films is fair.  This film was created in part to take advantage of the eventual success of the first film (which is of course about what happened ""a day after"" the events in this movie.)

The movie itself boasts great location shots filmed in South Africa and is generally pretty accurate. Historians have only recently worked out exactly what happened on this day back in 1879,it seems the British and colonial lines were spaced out at least up to 2km from there camp and the gaps between the soldiers was wide probably 2-3 metres and the field they were on consisted of hight grass put this together with the fact that they were about to fight the Zulus who were highly disciplined and were there in the thousands,once there assault had started all it took was a lull in the firing lines possibly due to jammed cartridges and the Zulus soon found away through.
Ive been to Isandhlwana on a few ocassions and have walked the battlefield its quite errie.there is a scene in the movie where two officers flee across the buffalo river from a little beach that looks like the bahamas with the regimental colours and that little beach does exist and is just a few kms away from the battlefield,its amazing.
All in all a excellent movie that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours worth getting just for the scenery. Like some other reviewers have said the digital transfer could have been better,sound quality could have been improved,pictute a little grainy but you will get over this and enjoy a classic move.

496350,5,6302689724,"Zulu Dawn is an excellent and historically accurate movie.  It seems to have been actually filmed at Isandalwana, Natal where the action took place.  Unfortunately, this movie should have come out before the excellent 'Zulu', simply because the massacre at Isandalwana occurred before the fight at Rourkes Drift depicted in Zulu.

It is also not quite as good of a film as is 'Zulu' which is a bit difficult to understand because this is clearly the better and more expensive production.  In 'Zulu' the acting is decidedly uneven. In ""Zulu Dawn"" the acting is very good.

This is the story of the largest, or one of the largest, destruction of European troops at the hand of 'barefooted natives' in history.  The British, because of supposed Zulu provocation, invade Zululand.  The Zulu prepare for a fight.  The British aren't worried--they have little respect for the fighting qualities of the Zulu--and split their force.  One force, split off from Gen. Chemsford's [Peter O'Toole's] main force by several miles, chances on a few Zulu herders.  At least they think it is just a few Zulu.  Zulu Impis have concealed themselves in broken ground in front of the British camp.

The Zulu attack taking heavy casualties from the fast shooting English but things start to go wrong.  The movie shows an overly officious ordinance NCO as being tardy in the distribution of ammunition.  Other sources claim, however, that the rifles got gummed up and jammed by black powder residues.  No matter.  The English couldn't maintain their rate of fire and suddenly the Zulu were among them, stabbing with their lethal assegai's [in Zulu the name of the weapon is for the sound of the short spear being jerked from a wound].  Suddenly the entire English force is in disarray and the Zulu are among the tents.  They run down and kill soldiers trying to flee.

I'm still not sure why this is not as good of a film as 'Zulu'.  Maybe it's because it's a defeat.

Zulu Dawn isn't in the Zulu league, but if you're interested in the period and can overlook a few historical errors, it's a good addition to that curious subgenre of British epics celebrating their humiliating military defeats. In its determination to set some of the colonial myths straight it does tend to overlook the Zulus' own imperial ambitions, divided leadership and tactical stupidity, but it's well staged with an exceptionally strong cast of familiar British faces and a wildly miscast Burt Lancaster offering one of the screens worst Oirish accents. The battle's a long time coming, but is worth the wait, and the film is genuinely spectacular, with director Douglas Hickox pulling off a particularly impressive river crossing sequence to the accompaniment of Elmer Bernstein's stirring score. However, if you don't get off on troop deployments and crowd scenes of colourfully clad British soldiers on the veldt, you'll probably find it heavy going for the first hour.

Sadly, as others have noted, this is a very shoddy DVD - like the UK issue it's cropped from its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio to 1.85:1 and with an inferior sound mix (the theatrical release prints had an excellent stereo soundtrack) and no real extras to speak of despite plenty being available.

another perspective to such thrilling story telling is one of deceit, lies, incompetence and cover-up. irresponsibility, intellectual sloth, greed, political self-serving, paranoia, class contempt for one's own countrymen, belief in racial superiority and myopic fear may very well be a more accurate take on 'doomed heroics' aka defeat.

this second perspective is the real story of ""zulu dawn"", the story of the english defeat at the hands of the zulu nation at isandlwana in 1879. in ""zulu dawn"" british leadership and its ritual masked arrogance sends its own countrymen, primarily uneducated poor, to their deaths because of that leadership's refusal to acknowledge the intelligence of its own non-english allies or to credit the ability of its opponents, the zulu.

While ZULU dealt with the siege at Rork's Drift in the aftermath of the battle of Isandlhwanna, this film deals with the battle of Isandlhwanna itself. In the 1870s, the British government of Natal in South Africa feared that the Zulu were growing too strong. They delivered to the Zulu king an ultimatum with which he could not comply. They then invaded. Everyone thought that the best infantry in the world, the British army, would soon put a Zulu notch in the imperial belt. Instead, the 24th regiment of foot was wiped out by Zulu impis at Isandlhwanna. This is the story of that disastrous campaign.

Peter O'Toole plays Lord Chelmsford with all of the arrogance which ultimately led to the destruction of the British expeditionary force. Burt Lancaster plays one of his knowledgeable officers and Bob Hoskins plays the regimental sergeant major. Each does a good job of portraying the character but the whole does not stand together as well as it should. The images of the impis washing over the British positions is frightening in its severity but there is little else in the way of excitement.

If the film were 100 percent accurate it would be unwatchable. One of the outcomes of this battle was that boy soldiers (<16) could not be sent on similar expeditions - to prevent similar mutilation and torture.  The basic message that the British screwed up as a result of poor leadership is accurate. When European soldiers and settlers encountered Zulus from fortified positions (even circled wagons) the results were mass slaughter of Zulu warriors.

As a Brit I don't mind addmitting that British (and Dutch)settlers were ""not nice"" to native people.  Hollywood has produced more inaccurate movies than this (e.g. Brave Heart and Mel Gibson's War of Inndependence movie).

The viewer once again is coached into feeling sympathy for the British once defeated even though it was the British who broke the treaties, crossed into restricted lands and threatened a people who up to that point honored their right to settlement in (their) land.  This movie again takes a stab at depicting a more accurate portrayal of the wars that took place on continents like Africa, India and the Americas and it will disturb many who are comfortable in their fantasy that Europe just walked into these lands and had their way with the savage.  These Africans were highly intelligent and very skilled at not only closed combat, closed order drill and unit tactics but they excelled at battlefield logistics by having supply and reinforcement units at their disposal to continue the fight for days.

It seem that many of the reviewers expects historical accuracy from movies. How can such expectation be after watching movies like Braveheart, Patriot, Windtalkers or Pearl Harbor??

Zulu Dawn gives a pretty good coverage of the initial stages of the Zulu War, one of many wars of aggression fought by the British Empire during the 19th century although it no worst then the wars of aggression United States wages against the American Indians during the same period. While not historically accurate per say, it gives a nice accountability of the British arrogance and greed versus the natives' defiance toward the imperial order.

Top notch cast with Peter O'Toole, Burt Lancaster and Simon Ward helped this movie considerably. Bo Hoskins as one of the sergents definitely add color to the cast. The events in the movie lies from the British point of view. Like all movies, there were historical free plays given to add spice, tension and characters to the historical events. Thats to be expected....!!

The battle scenes were well done and British mistakes well presnted even if they may or may not be historically accurate.

The image is also pretty average, okay on my outdated big projection TV but I am willing to guess that it may look bit crappy on a better TVs out there. This is also a very strip down DVD with no extras.

Most people who buy this DVD now will only do so to replaced their old VHS tape.

  Unfortunately, that was not available to us. Believe me, we tried.

 Having said that, TANGO appreciates the support from all of the fans out there. That passionate support tells us we did good, just by releasing it the way we could.

 Sit back, enjoy one of the greatest action films of it's time, and be aware that if a VIEWABLE version in widescreen is made available, we will try and get it.

  But viewing it any way, is better than none isn't it? The print is excellent.

 Enjoy and thanks for supporting TANGO Ent.",1127433600,18,894,4.380368098159509

I hope this is a printing mistake. I saw this film in super widescreen in the cinema on its first release and it was breathtaking. All the beautiful composition of the cinematography and African scenery will be lost and look horrendous just like the old VHS release......UNBELIEVABLE!

 the same company are releasing THE WILD GEESE in pan & scan too...get the copy from the UK in Widescreen and it has the same extras too...the 5 Stars is for the film only....WHAT A SHAME.",1126915200,14,641,4.614035087719298

The MFR can't be serious. This movie has to be in widescreen.

496712,5,6302689724,"First off DO NOT compare this to the Stanley-Baker 1964 epic.  This is different kettle of fish entirely.  I made that the mistake the first time I watched it and I came away dissatisfied.  If you are familiar with Zulu, you go in with preconceived expectations.  The comparison off the bat can make you prejudice against a fine work.

Cy Endfield co-wrote the epic prequel Zulu Dawn 15 years after his enormously popular Zulu. It was intended to be a trio of films - with a third movie Ulundi to round out what Cy had to say about British imperialism - the ""Little England"" mentality.

From point one the contracts are seen.  In Zulu you have a small pocket of a few over 100 Brits holding out against 4,400 Zulu - fresh from Islandlwana (the story told in Zulu Dawn).  This is a story of courage, will and determination.  Is a positive movie.  Zulu dawn on the other hand is a heart-rendering movie. Nearly 1400 soldiers and native levies were slaughter in a a matter of hours by over 10,000 Zulus.  Why because of Brit arrogance.  Lord Chelmsford (Victoria's cousin by the way - which may be why he wasn't punished for this fiasco!!)  Treated the Zulu campaign as a lark in the park.  He divided his forces in the face of the enemy, not once, but several times, resulting in the disaster at Islandlwana, as well as leaving other pockets of solders held up in the fashion you saw Baker and Caine - for months, in some cases over a year.  These death had to fall on Chelmsford's head.

The second contracts Zulu saw is a picture of the whole army under Chelmsford.  A contrast into the Brits lifestyle vs the Zulu.  The contrast of arrogance vs might and true military genius.  So the story is less focused on just one or two individuals such as Chard and Bromhead, but only the various commanders and officers. So the personal involvement isn't there.

Beautifully filmed, is a a good companion piece to Zulu and Shaka Zulu.  Some of my favourite films.

Just don't compare it to Zulu and you will find you enjoy the film.  However, it does tear the heart, instead of uplifting it as Zulu does.  It's a very a very realistic look at the worse military blunder until modern times, and likely STILL the worst defeat by a ""modern"" equipped army against native warrior warmed with only spears.

Just so sad the third film was never completed.",1126483200,14,2340,4.514285714285714
496713,4,6302689724,"This is an excellent movie, Bob Hoskins performance as the Colour Sergeant alone make the film worth watching.  I am glad to finally see it on DVD as my tape version has nearly worn out.  However it suffers in perpetuating old myths such as the lids on the ammunition boxes being screwed down as a major cause for the disaster for the British (these boxes were only made of wood and would quickly have yielded to one rifle butt being applied with vigor).  Also it is interesting to note that this battle is made into a much greater Zulu victory then in fact it was. While no doubt inflicting a devastating blow to the British, it was a very pyrrhic  victory at best to the Zulus, who took very heavy casualties they could ill afford. The film does not mention or explore Catayweo's own comment on hearing of the battle that ""An Assegie has been thrust into the heart of the Zulu people"".

Enjoy the movie for what it is, a movie with some great performances, but for the history of this battle read some of the excellent books available; particularly by Ian Knight.",1125619200,21,1065,4.469072164948454
496714,5,6302689724,"EXCELLENT movie, one of my favorites. When is the DVD version coming out?",1114128000,,73,4.6923076923076925
496715,4,6302689724,"I watched this film many times over just to figure out who was really to blame for the British's catastrophic defeat at Isandhlwana?

For one Part, The Zulu's numbers were just too overwhelming for them that day, there were too much politics on the British part and how they went about certain things(how they saw the Zulu live their own lives and by their customs and traditions) were based on blatant arrogance.

All of the above is all pointed out in this film and it is interesting to see how it all just came together the facts and dates in particular leading up to that fateful day of 22nd January 1879.

Burt Lancaster(the lone American in the all-British cast) is brilliant as the ill-fated Col. Durnford, complete with a shocking Irish accent but don't ever count out Peter O'Toole(Lord Chelmsford), Simon Ward (Vereker), Denholm Eliott (Pulleine), Nigel Davenport (Brown), John Mills (Sir Bartle Frere), a young Bob Hoskins (CSM Williams) and Simon Sabela's most fearsome, stand-out portrayal as the Zulu king, Cetswayo.

Anyway, if you have not seen Zulu or Zulu Dawn, you've not watched a great movie at all.

One of the most stand-out scenes would have to be Lancaster's death scene where after every redcoat(British soldiers) had been wiped-out, he is left to fight them off before a Zulu shoot him off the cart sending him falling down a steep hill before another Zulu throws a spear at him to kill him.  Pure genius acting for a legendary actor.

But the question to be answered, who is really to blame for the defeat at Insandhlwana? That we will never really know.",1109980800,6,1582,4.772893772893773
496716,4,6302689724,"This is a decent movie which attempts to cover its subject well.  The anti-British bias of the movie hurts its accuracy.  For one, the Zulu Kingdom was not some innocent, put upon people.  Shaku Zulu had spend years creating a brutal tribal kingdom that was under his complete control.  His seccessors were no less brutal.  King Catayweo may have been marginal less dictatorial than Shaku, but only by degrees.  Despite this flaw, the movie is still worthwhile.  Peter O'Tool lays it on thick by making Lord Chelmsford look the arrogant fool.  This was not quite the case.  Burt Lancaster does a nice job as Durnsford, and Simon Ward is great as the young gent recruit in the native horse.

The battle scene at Ishlandwana is impressive, but almost totally inaccurate.  For one thing the British firepower kept the Zulus pinned for quite a while.  The movie shows them charging forward ever invincible.  Only when the Britsh fire slackend were they able to surge forward and break the line.  The movie does not show this.  Also the Zulu prisoners reporting the British position back to the main Impi is pure fantasy!  This never happened and is another attempt by the movie to make the British look cruel and stupid!  There are some other flaws, but to me these are the most serious.

The production quality is first-rate, and the attention to the flow of historical events is well done, if a little confusing at times.  Those not familar with the campaign may have problems following it.  Although portrayed as one of the most serious defeats ever in British military history this is also an exaggeration.  The Zulu campaign was a embarrassment in some ways for the British, and also an un-wanted conflict, but the ultimate result was a crushing British victory a few weeks later under Chelmsford. Those who want a truly crushing victory of the natives over the Europeans should check out the fate of the Italians in Ethiopia in 1896! That was a true debacle.  The British endured their set-back and came back for the final win as they often did.  A flawed movie, but worthwhile.",1109894400,135,2080,4.764705882352941
496717,3,6302689724,"Ok, I just watched ""Zulu Dawn"", and although it is a good movie - and, allegedly, more historically accurate than ""Zulu"" by some accounts I have read - it lacks the drama and the human interest value of the earlier film.

In ""Zulu"", you get to know the characters from the officers down to the privates. Relationships between the privates and the officers and non-coms are an integral ingredient to the success of ""Zulu"". In ""Zulu Dawn"", characters ARE introduced to the viewer, but there is some dynamic missing. You aren't given enough of an insight into the characters. This results in many lost opportunities in the film.

There is simply something more personal about ""Zulu"" than ""Zulu Dawn"". In ""Zulu"", you are more invested in what is happening because of the character developments and the troop's comradery so well portrayed in that film. ""Zulu Dawn"" DOES introduce you to the officers Chelmsford, Durnford, etc... but I never felt as if I got to know them as well as I did Bromhead and Chard, Hook and Colour Sgt. Bourne, etc. After all, in a military drama, what is most important to portray is the special comradery that can only be achieved by those who fought together - who fought, literally, for their lives! It's the reason movies like ""Glory"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are so good. I felt that a battle like that which was fought at Isandlwana could have been ripe with opportunities for nail-biting, heart-wrenching, dramatic vignettes. But, unfortunately, I didn't get any of that.

One other point I want to make concerns the actual battle scenes themselves... If one has seen the film ""Waterloo"", then they will have noticed the epic battle scenes which were taken straight from some of the best-known paintings of the time. The scene of the charge of the Scots Grays is taken right from the Lady Butler painting, for example. That kind of imagery is vital, in my opinion, for a successful war film. You need to freeze time in war films in order for the viewer to really appreciate what happened. Otherwise, the chaos of warfare is not easily translated to film. Now, the way the battle of Isandlwana is portrayed in ""Zulu Dawn"" may very well be as close to historical accuracy as possible: hords of zulu warriors sweeping through the British camp and overwhelming everything in their path. Ok... I know that is what happened. But, how about a 20-30 second vignette based on the famous painting of the last stand of the 24th by Charles Fripp? Where was the scene of the last surviving troops being ordered to ""fix bayonets, and die like British soldiers do!""?  ... followed by a slow aerial pull-back from the small band of the 24th as the Zulus close in, closer and closer, until no more red coats are visible! What a scene THAT would have made! And what about the partial eclipse of the sun which apparently occured during the battle? Not a hint? Come on! The battle scenes were rushed through, and not enough attention to human interest and drama was paid to it. Too bad.

Again, I go back to ""Waterloo"" as an example of how a war movie should be filmed. Sergei Bondarchuk did some incredible work with aerial views and slow motion to great dramatic effect.

The arrogance and folly of the British military seems to be the focal point of this film.  We all know that this is exactly what lead to the slaughter at Isandlwana, and it is right to have put that point across in the film. However, the desparate fighting and brave stands made by the Brits should have received top billing. If not, then certainly a balance of the two could have been achieved.

The scene of Coghill and Melville attemptimg to save the Queen's colours was about the best scene in the whole movie. But, again, I did not feel for them the way I feel for Bromhead and Chard when I watch ""Zulu"".

All in all, a good film. But, I won't be returning to it as often as I do ""Zulu"".

Added 5/9/06:
I just viewed ""Zulu Dawn"" for a second time, and although I still do not think it is as good as ""Zulu"", I liked it more the second time 'round. As for character develoment, I think Burt Lancaster's portrayal of Colonel Durnford is one that merits ""sympathy"" from the viewer, while Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Chelmsford as an arrogant, single-minded, pompous *ss is also worthy of praise.",1097798400,15,4282,4.622368421052632

7829389,4,6302689724,"There are many reviews preceding mine.  Accordingly, I will reinforce where necessary the relative strengths and weaknesses of the Blu Ray 2013 Severin Release.  This to best guide potential purchasers; Amazon unfortunately combines reviews of all versions which in turn can confuse those seeking guidance

First the context of my review.  I watched and listened to the Blu Ray version using my Oppo 103 Darbee Ed. player set to 40, image seen on
 my Mitsuibishi DLP 54inch screen, sound thru my Snells left/right and Polk center speaker . Audio selected, via disc option, was ""Dolby Digital"". Sound  processed  by an Onkyo TX-SR707,a relatively higher end Receiver I have reviewed on Amazon. A second sound option on
the disc itself (DTS-HD) was experimented with but the  Dolby  Digital  2.0 worked best.  Lastly, I already  owned the much older DVD version.  I watched  that DVD completely to accurately compare and contrast it with the newer Blu Ray. I was eager to hear the older DVD for reasons made clear below.  Of all things, the audio transfer in the older DVD  is  atrocious. I note this Blu version comes with a companion DVD as well.  I did not watch that DVD.  There may be distinctions between the two DVDs given their difference in year of production. I will eventually  watch the  ""newer""companion DVD and edit this review if such is merited.

Video/Imaging

The DVD is significantly inferior.  Darkened night scenes, stock film, and what is seemingly varying camera/film crews are poor to often
distracting. Image often grainy;the DVD presents a very  plain poor overall image.  The 2013 Blu Ray presents an enormous improvement.
 The Oppo and 2013  Blu Ray, however, can only do so much.  The 1979 film,on Blu Ray, shows its age.  Someday, hopefully, a  video restored version will be produced (as was done with ""Zulu"" discussed below., Frame by frame resoration will pay off handsomely.  But I emphasize this Blu Ray still yields a rich,  usually very clean, gorgeous image and is a  huge improvement over the older  DVD version. Some grain is present, but largely the image is very pleasing.  For those who possess the older DVD, I urge you to upgrade and purchase the Blu version. This notwithstanding my audio criticisms set forth below. The film's aspect ratio  deserves a note.  According to Severin,  the film is ""restored"". Here that means, as much as I can tell, only  a return to the the film's  original 2.35 /1 aspect  ratio.  All to the very good.  However, as set forth below, this film is not ""restored"" overall.  Not the film itself, nor the audio which  remains far  less that what is needed.

Audio:

If you read the DVD version audio reviews, you will often read severe criticisms of the film's  muffled, unintelligible dialogue.  Most critics report that the sound is simply awful even when great audio equipment and volume controls are used.  I could not agree more. With my equipment listed above I was unable to enjoy the DVD movie as dialogue was frequently beyond comprehension. I even used my
headphones, but to no avail. Curiously, the limited music score and background sounds of the Zulu are fine in the DVD. But in the end, the poor audio on the  older DVD version simply ruins most people's  ability to enjoy the film. That version merits but one star.

There seems to be a similar criticism-but  often not to the same degree-regarding the Audio quality of the newer Blu Ray. Some find the Blu Ray a waste of money due to continued audio issues. Here I  somewhat disagree.  Please remember I am using very good equipment.
Although poor sound engineering/transfer continues to evident in the Blu version, it is far better than the DVD.  Peter O'Toole, eg,, can be
heard fairly well. Not so in the older DVD.  I believe the older DVD is ""Mono'. The Blu offers Dolby Digital 2.0.  And although on occasion the
dialogue isn't as clear as desired, it is usually clear enough to be heard and understood.  Accordingly, the Blu's audio now  permits a relatively pleasurable experience.  Just not the best.  Again, a restored re-engineered version of the audio is more than warranted.  If it ever occurs, I will be first in line to buy it.

I followed up for this review by playing the same Blu thru a lesser system (found in my bedroom). That consists of an older Panasonic Blu
player connected to an older Samsung LCD television, using its internal speakers.  There the Blu's audio  was markedly inferior to that discussed in  this critique using better equipment.. Very frustrating. The Video, however, was the same: very good to excellent.

Conclusion: Used with good audio  external speakers this Blu version of Zulu Dawn is worth its price.  On an older TV and without use of
good external speakers via  reliable sound processing as that usually provided in decent receivers,this  2013 Blu's audio  will still prove  quite
disappointing .I am convinced  the conflicting blu ray audio evaluations  reflect the choice of  speakers used when playing this recent Blu version. TV speakers will not do in most cases. My sense is an average receiver and use of external mid-range speakers is all this Blu requires.

The Film:

The film itself is based on a true, tragic story. It was shot at or nearby the actual locations of the 1879 conflict.  It is an exciting film to those
who enjoy (as I) history of such military and political clashes.  It is a well-done prequel, in the sense of actual time line, to the succeeding
events captured in Michael Caine's ""Zulu"".  Caine's  Zulu is now available as a Blu Ray without any Audio/Video distractions. It is a far
superior Blu transfer. Many also rate the Caine  Zulu as far superior in story line and acting.  I agree.  But unlike some, I believe this film stands on its own.

The two movies actually work very well together. (Think of the pair simply as Part 1/Part 2) .  Zulu Dawn (watched first) enhances the overall
experience of the Zulu (Caine) film by setting in context  the circumstances that brought about the Brit-Zulu conflict in 1879, leading up to where Caine's Zulu story essentially begins ( Rorkes Drift).  Indeed, the last words in Zulu Dawn are that a reddened sky is hovering over Rorkes Drift .

The sheer number of cast in both Zulu movies  is itself stunning.  No CGI!  The film's location/ settings, are in Africa in both movies and
visuals are simply beautiful.  So too the varying British uniforms. Skin color and tones are finely captured. I  discuss Caine's  Zulu  because
there is much inevitable  discussion and comparison here between the 2 movies in the reviews of Zulu Dawn.  I do wish to note that the Caine Zulu has wonderful extras, alone a reason to buy the 50th Anniversary Blu Ray.  Caine's Zulu music (wonderfully done by John
 Barry) was recorded in Africa during pre-shooting.  Zulu music and rhythms are the basis of a wonderful  written musical score.  Zulu
indigenous musical influence on the Caine  movie is not to be lost here.  Zulu dancing etc is also wonderfully discussed.  Caine's Zulu Blu Ray movie and its' extras merit 5 stars. But...., back to Zulu Dawn.

Zulu Dawn Blu also has extras of substantial value. The movie Zulu Dawn was inspired by Ian Knight's  book detailing the history of the 1879 Brit-Zulu war.  The author- in a well filmed extra- returned to the film's locations and provided outstanding explanations that are so illuminating that, in my opinion, this particular ""extra"" should be watched preceding the watching of Zulu Dawn and, for that matter, Caine's Zulu.  It fills in
the ""blanks"" and truly makes the film far more interesting. It also assures viewers of the film's overall accuracy in where the battle occurred,what happened, and why.

I rate this Blu Ray version of the movie Zulu Dawn 4 stars.  Had the audio problems been completely resolved, I would have scored it 4 and 1/2 stars but not 5. This rating assumes/requires use of good equipment.  As qualified: Highly recommended.  Enjoy!",1519084800,6,7960,4.817507418397626

7829391,5,6302689724,"Zulu Dawn (1979) is a great film, an account of the 1879 Zulu War and the Isandlwana campaign that led up to the more famous battle of Roarke's Drift. Unfortunately, the screenplay seems to be based on the misconceptions of Donald Morris' ""The Washing of the Spears"" (1965).

More recent scholarship, see in particular Lt. Col. Mike Snook's ""How Can Men Die Better"" (2005) and ""Zulu Victory"" by Ron Lock & Peter Quantrill (2002), have invalidated some of Morris' account.

Still, one cannot expect complete historical accuracy in a film. There is always something we can complain about. But they got the gist of it right and it's a rousing good saga, well-acted, with wonderful action scenes uncluttered by CGI, and a brilliant soundtrack.

It is also a nice lead-in to the 1964 film ""Zulu"" with Michael Caine. Highly recommended. Even while stirred by British courage, it is impossible not to sympathize with the Zulus in either film.",1515801600,,935,4.905063291139241
