766621,5,6304059647,"James Arness portrayed the western's most stable hero for years on television.  The character Marshall Dillon was presented as very human but very dedicated to serving law and people.  Similar to Launcelot in the Arthur Legends, Dillon fought for right and kept himself for one woman throughout his television series days as sheriff of Dodge City.  In these movies, the archetypal hero is beyond Dodge City as sheriff, but he never fails to be that man big enough to do the right thing for everyone as he deals with his own problems.  These three movies take him through the loneliness of a single life to the addition of offspring he never knew he had and a marriage that allows the aged hero to reap the joys of love and parenthood after nurturing others for so many years.  While some of the action obviously shows Dillon doing things that would be too physically demanding for a man of his age, it is fitting that the toughest man in Dodge City doesn't deteriorate in determination or skill in fighting and shooting.  Seeing Miss Kitty and Matthew Dillon as wrinkled as the rest of us is a little sad, but the spirit with which the heroism continues is a beautiful reminder that there is a little bit of hero in nearly all of us.",1230336000,39,1233,4.5565610859728505

766623,5,6304059647,"There were five made-for-TV Gunsmoke movies. These three have something
in common. They refer to long-lasting, bitter conflicts in the Old West
with repercussions even today.

Return To Dodge is a continuation of an episode in TV series. The TV
episode provides a key item of information not repeated in the movie.
Ex-marshal Matt Dillon's arch-antagonist, Will Mannon, was the
blood-thirstiest pistolero riding with Quantrill. To this day, Quantrill
and the Border Ruffians raises hackles between the descendants of
Kansans and Missourians in the prelude to the Civil War.

The Last Apache deals with the predicament of unsurrendered Native
Americans. Ex-marshal Matt Dillon encountered the die-hard wrath of the
last of these in this movie. Even today, the issues are not completely
resolved.

To The Last Man is based on the notorious war between cattlemen and the
sheepmen that lead to the exterminative Pleasant Valley War. Ex-marshal
Dillon and his daughter Beth are caught up reluctantly in the crossfire.
The battle between cattlemen and sheepmen lasted a long time, but may not
be entirely past. Environmental and climate stresses may see this type of
struggle for scarce natural resources re-emerge in the West.

These three movies will be entertaining and edifying Gunsmoke fans, old
and new, for long time to come.",1218067200,21,1326,5.270142180094787
766624,5,6304059647,I got these for my Man Boss for Christmas of 2006. He has really enjoyed them. He just loves Gunsmoke. I have yet to watch them. Someday I will.,1202860800,3,144,4.0
766625,4,6304059647,"All 3 movies were very good. My favourite was return to dodge. It was based on the series episode Mannon, which was a very good episode. The series was one of the best shows on television. The stories would still hold up today. The movies in my opinion were weak versions of the TV episodes. I am glad the movies are out on DVD but only because I hope it leads to getting TV episodes on DVD. It would be like a choice for lets say seinfeld fans having a choice between 3 seinfeld movies over a box set of the whole series. I think that would be an easy choice. Or choosing between 3 law and order movies over a box set of the whole series, another easy choice. I will take the movies for now, and I will probably buy the other 2, and they are all good, but I really want the whole series on DVD eventually. I just bought have gun will travel first season, it didn't come yet, I will probably like it but I bought it mainly for a vote to get some of these great classic western series on DVD, mainly gunsmoke. Most of the old TV series released on DVD are pretty weak TV, I hope to see old TV shows that had a good run and were popular, and gunsmoke was the perfect example of this. I hope to see it soon.",1089676800,32,1204,4.0
766626,4,6304059647,"WITH THE OUTPOURING OF POOR PICTURES FROM THE WEST COAST WE ARE FORCED AT TIMES TO TURN TO WHAT USUALLY IS SECOND RATE ENTERTAINMENT IN THE FORM OF 'MADE FOR T.V.' MOVIES.
FEW OF THEM ARE WORTH YOUR TIME. JUST WATCH THE 'LIFETIME' MOVIE CHANNEL FOR A FEW HOURS AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN.
BUT EVERY NOW AND AGAIN ALONG COMES A CUT ABOVE. THIS ONE IS ONE OF THOSE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN TELEVISION EFFORTS THAT ACTUALLY ENTERTAINS NICELY.
WESTERN FANS ARE ALWAYS THRILLED TO SEE JIM ARNESS UP AND AROUND AND BACK TO RIGHTING WRONGS. FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF YOU CAN THRILL TO MATT DILLON, RETIRED U.S. MARSHAL TAKING OUT THE TRASH ONCE AGAIN.
DILLON IS TRYING HIS HAND AT CATTLE RANCHING AND WHEN HIS SMALL HERD IS RUSTLED HE IS BACK ON THE TRAIL OF THE BAD GUYS AND FINDS HIMSELF SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF A RANGE WAR.
ARNESS IS SUPPORTED WELL BY VETERAN ACTORS MORGAN WOODWARD AND PAT HINGLE. THIS FILM HAS A 'PAY ATTENTION' MOODY SOUNDTRACK THAT IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR SMALL SCREEN PRODUCTIONS.
AND JUST LIKE THE OLD 'GUNSMOKE' SERIES, THE WRITING IS EXCELLENT. THE DIALOGUE IS SHARP AND EFFECTIVE.
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING SUPERIOR ABOUT THE DELIBERATE 'CAN DO' ATTITUDE OF MATT DILLON. HE NEVER HESITATES TO DO THE RIGHT THING. HE DOESNT HAVE TO MEDITATE ON IT OR REGRET IT AFTERWARDS.
HE IS A SLIGHTLY FLAWED BUT ALWAYS WHITE HAT GOOD GUY. THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED IN THIS 'AGE OF THE WIMP' DOUBTFUL 21ST CENTURY.
AT LEAST ONE PART IN THIS SHOW WAS MISCAST. THE YOUNG UNDECIDED COW THIEF WHO TURNS OUT TO BE A DECENT HAND COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER PLAYED. THE ACTOR PLAYING THIS PART DOESNT MAKE THE GRADE. HIS PUT ON COWPOKE 'TWANG' IS SEE THROUGH AND THIS HURTS THE OVERALL CREDIBILITY OF THE PICTURE
JUST A TAD.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT-
'GUNSMOKE; TO THE LAST MAN' IS QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT. LONG LIVE MATT DILLON!!!",1048982400,22,1818,4.446107784431137

That would have put his time at the ranch around 1862. He was supposed to be in the civil war then, not marshal of Dodge.  Also, a couple of the videos froze and skipped some.

767602,5,6304059647,"My headline is a shortened quote from the first of the movies in the Gunsmoke collection, Return to Dodge.  However, it is a fitting title and an homage to the character of Matt Dillon, ably played by Jim Arness for over 40 years.  The movies do indeed show Dillon as an ""old bull"" coping with life in the still-violent Old West after leaving Dodge City and Miss Kitty behind.

All three of these movies deserve collector status.  Since  Arness's death in 2011, CBS has finally seen fir to release all of the old Gunsmoke series videos little by little.  Jim's How the West Was Won series is also out on DVD, with its own iconic figure, Zeb Macahan.  Zeb was one of Arness's favorite characters because he was a wild and woolly mountain man, unfettered by the restraints of the law.  However, if you know him as I do, you know Zeb always did the right and honorable thing, either in defense of folks in trouble, his family, or himself.  But I digress........

All of the DVD's are clear and sharp, with excellent video and audio.  There are no special features, but with Dillon in the saddle for so many years you really don't need them.  Buy the set if you are a die-hard Gunsmoke fan.  If you're not, it's a great place to start!

These films are significant not because they show Dillon in different settings or make a huge attempt to show his age.  They are  testament to the fact that with the right actors, a good script, and a commitment to the ideals of honor and justice, good Westerns never go out of style.  Matt's commitment to personal honor and justice for everyone does not tarnish with age.  In fact, it shines ever brighter.  Even without his two ounces of tin, the star still weighs invisibly on his chest, and we all see the toll it takes on him.
Yet, Dillon is still a man, and he must do what he must do because he is a man.

Of the three films, ""Return to Dodge"" is probably the best known, because, as one reviewer has pointed out, the bad guys don't get much badder than the late, great, Steve Forrest, who actually outdrew Dillon as Will Mannon in the original series in a 1969 episode.  The movie is worth watching to see the closure that it brings to this storyline.

""The Last Apache"" showcases Arness's excellent working chemistry with the late Richard Kiley and Miss Michael Learned, who was also the only woman Dillon ever kissed on film, NOT Miss Kitty.  There is also a very believable, gritty portrayal of Matt's daughter Beth by Amy Stock-Poynton.  The apple doesn't fall far from the tree here.

""To the Last Man,"" the third member of the trilogy, is  a bit more violent than the other two, because it places Matt smack in the middle of the Pleasant Valley War of the late 1880's.  This one is still enjoyable, however, because old Gunsmoke vets Pat Hingle (Dr. Chapman) and Morgan Woodward (characters too numerous to list,) are around to help with the action sequences.

So, for those of us who are over 50 and like Westerns, buy the set, sit back, and enjoy a bit of nostalgia.  Younger fans, buy this anyway.  You just might get hooked.  Matt Dillon wasn't a role model for nothing, and there won't ever be another actor that can do Matt as Arness did.",1414540800,,3192,4.461139896373057

It has strong production values, an absorbing plot and many well-staged action sequences. At times the violence is brutal but always in context and not excessively graphic. Arness convinces again as the morally upright lawman and there is an endearing performance by Amy Stock-Poynton who plays his daughter. The script by Earl Wallace provides the understated, at times terse dialogue which sounds authentic and also allows satisfying deepening of the viewer's understanding of the characters. The direction by Jerry Jameson, who also directed 'The Long Ride', is crisp and makes great use of landscape and colour to convey the tough life of the Old West. As an aside, actor Jason Lively, who played Rusty Griswold in 'European Vacation', delivers his role with style and even keeps the same first name as he had as a Griswold.
