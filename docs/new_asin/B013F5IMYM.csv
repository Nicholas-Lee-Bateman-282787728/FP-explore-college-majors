7363767,3,B013F5IMYM,"When we purchased this DVD my daughter was excited to see the pink kitty on the cover. The kitty is on the cover, but not in any of the 5 episodes. This is the episodes included on the DVD ""Fetchin Findo/Twin Tweaks,"" ""Three Goats A Cuddlin'/Swimmer's Belly,"" ""A Dragon's Best Friend,"" ""Stuffy & Squibbles/Queen Of Thrones"" and ""Take Your Pet To The Vet/Master And Commander"". The DVD was cute, but she was disappointed not seeing the kitty. I didn't know the name of the episode with the kitty, but I assumed it was on this DVD since they had a picture of the kitty on the cover. Cute movie, but misleading cover...",1460332800,4,616,4.508928571428571

8727419,1,B013F5IMYM,"My family really enjoys Doc McStuffins, but NOT this DVD.  Doc keeps secrets from her parents and lies about it (in an 'innocent and cute' way yes), but nonetheless they are most definitely secrets and lies to cover them up which I don't want to ever encourage.  Plus there is a song which is repeatedly sung that is 'She's not bossy, she's the boss'.  When my little one kept repeatedly saying she was bossy, I knew the DVD had to go!  I'm disappointed in the storylines / they're not at all educational and fun the way they normally are.",1480032000,9,539,4.414141414141414
