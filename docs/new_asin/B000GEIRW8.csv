8131215,4,B000GEIRW8,"Chris Duarte is an amazing guitar player and musician. If you're buying this with the intent of learning licks, go elsewhere, unless you are good at learning from live performance footage included as part of the DVD. There are no breakdowns of guitar licks. What you will get is a breakdown of how Chris approaches the guitar and practice recommendations to improve your playing and make you a better musician along with recommendations on how to add color to your playing. His recommendations work and will make you a better player if you take them to task. If you are serious about learning your instrument, this is a good addition to your instructional materials.",1483056000,,666,4.850877192982456

8131217,2,B000GEIRW8,"I'm a huge Chris Duarte fan, and he does some great stuff, but the writers and producers of the DVD have fallen way short in teaching us Chris Duarte's technique, and the technical elements of his style. I feel bad for Chris, because this DVD reflects poorly on him, and it's not even his fault. The DVD is little more than ""here's me playing some stuff. You should practice as much as you can. Look up how to do these things somewhere.""",1419984000,,437,4.341463414634147
8131218,5,B000GEIRW8,"This DVD is great. It's aim is not to teach beginners. If you are a Chris Duarte fan you will like it a lot. If you want to learn from the beginning how to play guitar get a beginner's dvd, a teacher, or use Youtube. You can't learn guitar overnight, it takes years. This is for the Duarte fans and it's my favorite DVD.",1419897600,,320,4.015625
8131219,4,B000GEIRW8,I only wish I could play guitar .So this video wouldn't teach me anything . I will say I've seen Chris play live at least 4 times . He absolutely floors me . He can entertain for a two or 2 and a half hour stretch and amaze my face off .I would love to get this .,1273190400,,263,3.5517241379310347
8131220,5,B000GEIRW8,"chris is one of the greatest guitarists but he never really seemed to make it big. well if you just want to see him play live which you can't see anywhere else, here is your chance. he smokes on several numbers and he's great. gear review as well. i only wish there were more dvds of him.",1230854400,4,288,4.0701754385964914
8131221,5,B000GEIRW8,"I have to disagree with the previous review. While it's true, that no DVD is going to make you a musician on the level of Chris Duarte, this product does give you some insight on how to begin. I thought the advice was good and the close ups where worth the price of admission alone. If you are a guitar player and a fan of Chris' then this DVD is probably for you. If you are guitar player/musician who stritcly wants to learn theory, then a mel bay book/dvd may be a better choice.",1185580800,5,482,4.138297872340425
8131222,1,B000GEIRW8,"I really enjoy Chris Duarte's playing but I feel this video is little to no value to any player.  If you are a new player, he doesn't really teach you anything.  He tells you a few times that you need to get into the material and figure it out yourself.  If you are an experienced player, he is not going to tell you anything you haven't heard before.  I've purchased two of these newer Hal Leonard videos (also have the Eric Johnson video) and I don't really think either of them are done very well.  The Hot Licks videos are older but much more useful, if you actually want to learn something.",1154649600,4,595,4.276785714285714
