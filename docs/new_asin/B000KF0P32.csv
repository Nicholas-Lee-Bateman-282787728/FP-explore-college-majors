8156182,4,B000KF0P32,I got this for my son because he loves the show. I have watched it with him and seen the whole of the series I believe. It was pretty good and I enjoyed the story. It is engrossing and you can get invested in the characters without fear of them going poof by the end. I think the ending was pretty good to and like how they left it so that it could continue. I like a story that has a happy ending. I would though recommend seeing it from the start to finish and not trying to watch out of order.,1376870400,,496,3.872549019607843

8156184,5,B000KF0P32,"An amazing volume that really brings a great deal of the development in the series recently together. The series is obviously far from over(as I should hope considering this is only the 6th release of 12), but this was still obviously a pivotal volume for this series.

My only real complaint is that a few portions of the time Renton spends with Charles and Ray seems a little awkward. Not a big deal considering all the character development we see with Renton, and even more so with Eureka herself. We even get some hints at the greater storyline in the third episode on this volume along with a some ""edge of your seat"" moments in the last episode and an important battle of sorts.

The technical merits remain strong with the series and the performances and music all come together with their usual grandeur.

The shirt provided with this special edition is a light gray shirt in size large with the Eureka Seven logo printed on the upper corner of the front and the japanese segement of the logo printed large on the back. The manga remains true to itself, which is disappointing to me as I find it lacking the style and substance the series portrays so effectively.",1209254400,,1172,4.598086124401914
8156185,5,B000KF0P32,I have been a fan or this anime sense its premiere in Japan. The devotion the creators put into the development of its character is what really separates Eureka Seven from other animes. The well developed story combined with the brilliant animation from BONES really makes this one of the best anime series ever made.,1184630400,,317,4.781818181818182
8156186,5,B000KF0P32,"In volume 6 of Eureka Seven you get episodes 23 to 26 of the series. In our last volume, Renton left the Gekko after believing he caused Eureka to nearly die. Out on his own, Renton meets Charles and Ray Beams, a couple who take a liking to him, but with an interesting past. Back on the Gekko, the crew must move on without Renton, but Eureka still doesn't know what has happened. As leader, it is Holland's duty to inform Eureka, but will he?

Renton believes he has found a home as Charles and Ray insist he calls them papa and mama. Everything appears to be going perfectly until he discovers Charles and Ray are supposed to capture Eureka and the Nirvash. As Renton leaves the two, they are heart broken, but remain focused on their mission. Eureka finally learns what happened to Renton and is crushed. She longs to see him again, and little does she know, but Renton feels the same. After meeting a strange, but kind man and his wife, Renton decides to return to the Gekko.

In a taste of irony, Renton arrives back on the Gekko just as Eureka leaves it to look for him. She is attacked by Charles and Ray, but can Renton get to her in time? The outcome results in my opinion in one of the greatest scenes in the show.

Episode 26, Morning Glory, is my favorite episode of the show as it is the first where Renton and Eureka are together as a couple. All the episodes on this disc are full of emotion, mostly sadness, but this episode is the opposite. It depicts happiness after quite a few darker episodes in regards to emotions and leaves you feeling good, and a bit wary of the future as Charles and Ray plan a counterattack.

Overall, this is a great disc with 4 terrific episodes of Eureka Seven. If you have read this and have no idea what I'm talking about, buy the first volume of this show, starting it here would be unwise. Still, this disc is the halfway point and contains my favorite episode of the show, I recommend it to all fans of anime.",1176854400,2,1961,4.320652173913044
