8732785,4,B0155YQYY6,"I remember when these shows first aired, I watched the Houndcats, but not the Barkleys. I guess it seemed like ""All in the Family"", not my cup of tea at that age (7) or maybe something better was on another channel. Not sure.
But I'm digressing here..
Watching these shows now, in my old age, they're not bad, amusing even. I remembered the Houndcats theme song & the Stutz, spy kind of show, fun.
Barkleys are like ""All in the Family"", but with dogs. There's even a meathead type.
DVD transfer is good. I'm happy with it.
To be honest, very surprised to see this on DVD, thought I was the only one that remembered them.",1533081600,,620,4.353448275862069
