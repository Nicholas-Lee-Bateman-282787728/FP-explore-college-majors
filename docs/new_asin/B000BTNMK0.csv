8092516,5,B000BTNMK0,"This show was quite good. It had a lot of potential for character development. The lead character seemed to be living at least two full lives, at times at war against his conscience as to which road he should be pursuing.

I would love to get my hands on all the episodes.",1448236800,2,272,4.230769230769231
