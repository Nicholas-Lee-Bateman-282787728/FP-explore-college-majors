8554584,5,B00ANCWXW8,"Buckley is not my cup of tea. But I respect him. And this review is not specific to this particular Carl Bernstein interview. I'm speaking in general. I have something like eighteen shows. Some-times it's a love-fest. Sometimes a brutal embarrassment for a guest (Jack Kerouac, his brain long soaked in alcohol). But usually a good, respectful, vigorous exchange of paradigms, opinions, and ideas, one of the better features of this country. They always seem too short; but find a guest you like, and enjoy!",1507334400,,507,4.976470588235294

8554586,1,B00ANCWXW8,Buckley is insufferable.  The reporters can barely get their answers out before he's saying and/or asking something ridiculous.  I have seen interviews and other footage of him before and was led to believe he was quite intelligent.  Not on display in this episode.,1459209600,,265,5.116279069767442
8554587,4,B00ANCWXW8,Buckley has a knack for interviewing people with storied lives and Woodward and Bernstein have that and  this interview was almost a confessional of sorts. A blast from the past.,1458345600,,178,4.933333333333334
8554588,5,B00ANCWXW8,"William F. Buckley was a public intellectual whose kind has not been seen since his passing.  ""Firing Line"" was an intelligent show that captured the attention of a wide audience in a way that's almost unimaginable in today.  Buckley's broadcasts serve as an important piece of history and insight into the political scene in the final third of the 20th century.

This particular episode, originally taped during the middle of the Watergate investigation raises good points regarding journalistic objectivity.  No matter what one's views might be regarding Nixon, Buckley raises points that are still valid today.",1403740800,,613,5.354166666666667
8554589,5,B00ANCWXW8,"This show aired not long before Nixon resigned. I remember reading he resigned
because he would have been impeached. I followed the Watergate hearings
and was amazed at how much was wrong with the White House.
Truth is stranger than fiction...this is so true with the Nixon White House.",1395964800,,286,4.857142857142857
