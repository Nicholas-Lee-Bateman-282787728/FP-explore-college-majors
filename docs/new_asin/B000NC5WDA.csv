8176665,5,B000NC5WDA,This was an excellent movie that both children and adults would enjoy.  Good family values and nothing offensive.  It takes place in England and the Bastable family has fallen on hard times.  The children dream up ways to increase the family fortunes in very creative and sometimes hilarious ways.,1315008000,4,297,5.020408163265306
8176666,5,B000NC5WDA,"This charming film is loosely based on a classic story by E. Nesbit, a wonderful children's author whose English Victorian Age stories are still read today. As in many of her stories, 5 kids are left to their own amusement while a parent struggles to earn a living. In this case, their father is an inventor, who has been at work for 6 years in an effort to create a refrigerator. However he is in serious debt, and in risk of losing everything. He is also struggling with the loss of his wife. The kids are determined to help and take on several well-meaning attempts that usually create more trouble than help for their father.

The film is humerous and loaded with invention. While it is fairly difficult to adapt the book to film in any case, the film is very watchable on its own. Great acting, accurate period costumes, cars and homes combine to give the viewer a nice immersive sense of the beautiful era of Victorian England. The film has wonderful values, and we all felt great after watching it. Other E. Nesbit stories that have been adapted to film are ""5 Children and It"", ""The Phoenix and the Carpet"", and ""The Railway Children"".  A nice family friendly film, similar to a Hallmark movie.",1272931200,2,1202,4.560185185185185

It's a good family movie!

My kids did watch it again another time and also really enjoyed it...",1263340800,2,234,4.065217391304348
