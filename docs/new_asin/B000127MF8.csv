8005347,3,B000127MF8,Over all the movie sucks! But you can't expect too much from 1983. Now I am a Jim Carrey collector and I have tried to locate every film he's been in so this is good enough for a collector but it's very deceiving having Jim's name and picture on the front. He only has an unspoken part mid-way through for about 2 minutes.,1438300800,,322,4.126984126984127

8005349,1,B000127MF8,I am a huge Jim Carey fan and was so excited to buy this movie. It wasn't until it is home and opened that I realized it doesn't work on US DVD players.  :(.  Have a movie I can't watch.  Disappointed,1304640000,2,200,3.8292682926829267
