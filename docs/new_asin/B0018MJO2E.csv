Made in Australia in 1906, only 3 years after Edwin S Porter's pioneering one-reel Western, THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, but more than 9 years before D W Griffiths' BIRTH OF A NATION, this seven-reel epic, running for over an hour, is a dramatic retelling of the story of Australia's most notorious bushranger (outlaw, to our American friends).
Its importance to the history of world cinema is indisputable, but is never as widely recognised as it should be.
Much of the fragile nitrate footage is now lost, but this DVD vividly recreates the film from the surviving footage and production stills.
An astonishing achievement!",1330041600,2,715,5.067796610169491
