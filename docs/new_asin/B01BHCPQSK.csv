7634901,5,B01BHCPQSK,Im so excited that they are releasing these on DVD. I can't wait for future seasons to be released. Also hoping they will do original sentai's.,1456272000,16,143,4.538461538461538
7634902,5,B01BHCPQSK,"The series is pretty solid and Billy Hayes' complaint about the cover aesthetics isn't a real review. However you feel about the cover, a legitimate home video release for Super Sentai in the States is something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime. If you like this stuff, and you want more of it released outside of Japan, then stop belly-aching over the covers like a whiny child and buy these releases.",1455408000,58,408,4.602739726027397

7634904,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Kakuranger might be my favorite classic sentai. I love the sort of comic book feel it has. Plus it's cool to see the ""alien Rangers"" suits get a lot more action. The monsters are silly and fun and I love the cast and the mecha.",1489363200,2,227,4.066666666666666
7634905,3,B01BHCPQSK,The item itself is great. My bf loved it as a gift. But the box was cracked and the cover was ripped and peeling. Also there was a piece of the clasp that closes the box which broke off and was rattling in the box. It was a cheaply made box which was disappointing because it was given as a gift to someone who was working on their collection.,1485993600,,343,3.9855072463768115
7634906,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Absolutely love this, so interesting to watch.  I love Power Rangers, but and really starting to prefer the sentai versions of the shows.  Have Zyuranger and Dairanger on order and Carranger on pre order, and will also get Ohranger pretty soon, hope these continue to come out.",1485734400,3,277,4.872340425531915
7634907,5,B01BHCPQSK,After watching this I'm trying to figure out how we ended up with Alien Rangers of all things.  This is so much better,1484352000,2,118,4.130434782608695
7634908,5,B01BHCPQSK,Great item recommend for any collector anybody who has Power Rangers,1480032000,,68,5.2727272727272725
7634909,5,B01BHCPQSK,Series was cute. Nothing serious. DVD quality very good.,1479168000,,56,5.333333333333333

7634911,5,B01BHCPQSK,Finally see what Saban chopped up to make Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers and season 3 of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.,1474329600,,116,4.85
7634912,5,B01BHCPQSK,I can't wait for the rest of the original versions of sentai to come out. I've got most of them from overseas but need the seasons up to Wild Force.,1473465600,,148,3.966666666666667
7634913,5,B01BHCPQSK,"This whole season, and box set for that matter, are highly well made pieces! If you are a fan of Power Rangers or Sentai or even Ninjas to an extent don't forget to pick this up!",1473292800,,178,3.9722222222222223
7634914,4,B01BHCPQSK,"Now this is a series I had been looking forward to. I was surprised to learn that the Shogunzords (called the Giant Beast Generals) came first, followed by the Beast General Fighters (Battle Borgs in Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers), and then the Super Stealth Beast Gods (Ninjazords on MMPR). It seems that Saban had to be most creative when dealing with the third season, as Kakuranger has no Sixth Ranger. NinjaWhite (Tsuruhime) is the female ranger and pilots what MMPR would call the Crane Zord. The FalconZord (Holy Stealth Beast Tsubasamaru here) is an independent mecha, and not piloted by the White Ranger as MMPR would have you believe. If the third season of MMPR had played Kakuranger straight, Tommy would be considered irrelevant.

The subtitles are clear and concise, although Shout!/Toei uses a lot of context in subbing (""onii-chan"", which means ""big brother"" in Japanese, is often shown on the screen as ""mister"" or the character's name). However, that is what makes the most sense. The sound quality is good, and the video is good, given its age. I like this.",1470441600,6,1075,4.906593406593407
7634915,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Another excellent Sentai release from Shout Factory. Video & sound quality is solid, subtitles are also great, they're readable & stay long enough on screen to read. Unfortunately, there's no special features.",1470355200,,209,5.5625
7634916,5,B01BHCPQSK,"i so am glad we finally get to see the real power rangers and not cut up pieces of footage. While there is some similarity, between the American and the original Japanese version. The original can't be beat,  I am looking forward to more releases.",1469059200,7,247,4.488888888888889
7634917,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Well my first purchased sentai series (looking to get Dairanger and Zyuranger and upcoming Ohranger)  Have not bought any power Ranger sets as  upon watching the source material just woke me up that and I remember even the prior release (though a spoof) in Dynaman (and yet it is a real series)

The characters were enjoyable even the Youkai (I feel bad for the Taxi driver one as he just enough of Human's crap.)  The ending theme popped into my head too many times though. I caught myself singing it at work. (Maybe that's also a dislike but only one.)

My only gripe is I had one episode glitch on me but other than that would highly recommend.  Alien Rangers which used footage from this really feels like a mock job to this great series now.  On to the next and hoping we may see the likes of Jetman, Dynaman (the original), Bioman, JakQ and even the starter of it all Goranger get subbed and brought out if these keep going.  Await when get to a fav like Gokaiger and Dekaranger",1468281600,8,984,4.397790055248619
7634918,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Ninja Sentai Kakuranger is a more comical sentai series than Zyuranger & Dairanger, which make the show stand-out.  It tells the adventures of a rag-tag team of ninjas traveling across Japan defeating monstrous beings called Youkais.  The characters are awesome in many ways; we have a female leader, a guy who speak English at the start of the series, an anchorman who helps explain thing, and later a blue armor ninja who get mad whenever someone calls him ""novice"" just to name a few.  The storyline is great to, it goes from random fighting monster to epic journey when they learn the true leader of the Youkais.  We also see how the main characters develop through-out the series.  This is a must-have for any Power Ranger/Super Sentai fan, and I hope ""Shout Factory"" will keep bring us more Super Sentai.",1466812800,2,810,4.757142857142857
7634919,5,B01BHCPQSK,"Great series.  Supporting ShoutFactory so we get more Super Sentai!

Kakurangers is a more comedic sentai, so people getting into this right after Zyuranger and Dairanger should be aware of that.  It doesn't take itself seriously and wants it's audience to laugh with them.  Because of that, the show has it's own charm.  It's one of my favorite Sentai, and I'm glad it got a DVD release.  The gimmick of the show follows ninja themes.  All the protagonists are kind of out of their league to a comedic effect.  The leader is a female (first in Sentai history).  There is a character that usually only speaks English and no one can understand him.  There also is this crazy narrator who's so goofy you keep laughing at him. I get the sense he's doing tongue twisters or riddles sometimes, but they don't translate well.  Still he's funny.  Trust me, if you love Super Sentai and wacky japanese culture, you'll love this.",1466726400,9,920,4.68125
7634920,5,B01BHCPQSK,And with another sentai series under my belt and once again I've fallen in love :) ! Not too much else to say really if your a fan of sentai then look no further fantastic series probably my favorite so far.,1466553600,,207,4.073170731707317
7634921,5,B01BHCPQSK,I am so glad to finally be able to watch the entire series of kakuranger since it's a series I've always enjoyed but never got to watch all the way through. And I'm really satisfied to hear that ohranger coming out soon all I have to say is keep giving us more and more Super Sentai on dvd.,1465171200,2,290,4.017241379310345
7634922,5,B01BHCPQSK,"I finished this yesterday (3rd June) and I loved it, I really hope we get more Sentai and even possibly pre Zyuranger Sentai. I love how Sentai is more emotional than Power Rangers and you can actually feel for the characters and know their in danger even the childern  which is something Power Rangers would never do.  Keep it up Shout as the more you release the more I'll import.",1464998400,2,382,4.442857142857143
7634923,4,B01BHCPQSK,"With the announcement of Ohranger for the fall. There is no doubt Shout will be releasing the rest of the original sentai series, a real treat for us!
Kakuranger was an interesting mix. Some things for me were solid all around, others were a mix bag.  But it never hindered my viewing experience that much.
So plot is the usual, evil villains are set free and the decedents of the original Kakurangers must stop them.
I must admit the format was slightly jarring at first. Throwing in random curve balls like the commentator for the first half of the show. He was there mainly to tell us the Orgin of the Yokai of the week. His presence is toned downed later thankfully. He also gets his own sort of meta episode which I found amusing.
For the team we had a female leader for the group for a bit, the white ranger. However she seemed to take a backseat and the red ranger stepped in. Not sure if the powers that be changed it up, as it was gradual. But I think someone wimped out. Her development is not impacted though and I found the subplot with her father to be the strongest of the series.
Having the black ranger be from America was random and him being a cowboy action star was hilarious
Two things right off the bat. Wasn't a fan of the nonchalant mentor to the team. He sorta just came and went and I felt did not guide them as much as other mentors I've seen. When Ninjaman finally arrives (Ninjor for the US) it was cool to see how vastly different he was to our take on him. We dubbed him as a boisterous 50's superman, yet Kakurangers portrays him as a hotheaded student to the God Generals (the ninja zords)
Also I was unsure as to whom the villain was until ep 12 where the mad scientist and Junior (Rito Rovolto US) appear. JR as this heavy metal rock star was amazing and he chewed up that scenery.
Later on when the big baddie Daimaou appears (master Vile) the show finally goes into dark territory with some surprisingly emotional moments you didn't expect.
So I felt the emotional tone shifted constantly either it being quite silly or dark.
Music was just not sitting with me this time. Wayyy too repetitive. Comparing it to the previous series Dairanger (which i felt was much more solid all around) this one was a step down slightly.
And I have to say honesty the ending was a mix for me.
I won't spoil it. But it comes down to the team having to handle things in a non conventional way. While I appreciate the change in order to teach a lesson, it didn't gel with me since i did feel Daimaou was pure evil and not a misunderstood villain like Bandora. Anyways
Regardless of my criticism. It was still a solid ride and I can take my 90's kid glasses off now to see just how much of a cheese fest PR was.
 We sanitized it so badly. Even in its goofy moments, Sentai is never afraid to go dark with its fights, death, and it really is refreshing to here Damn and go to hell. I know that sounds weird. But i always give Japan brownie points as they rarely tone things down so that overprotective parents feel safe.
I will confess I probably shouldn't of binged watched this, maybe more in doses over the course of a week. That's what I would recommend for this show.
Show is once again bare bones in the same multi disc case as previous ones. Picture looks fantastic and subs are fine/readable.
keep em coming Shout Factory!!",1464652800,8,3345,4.333333333333333
7634924,3,B01BHCPQSK,"Shout! is the company releasing these and they're doing the western fans of Super Sentai a great service by providing them at all.  Who would've thought we'd ever see official subbed releases here in the US?  I'm largely happy about the situation.

Zyuranger's subs were a little stiff and had minor typos and such, but Dairanger's release was pretty much perfect.  So, when this series popped up on Amazon, I pre-ordered it immediately and eagerly awaited released.  However, now that its here, I can't help but be disappointed with the subtitles.

While they did make the font of the subs thicker, white with black borders, and generally easier to read, they basically skipped out on translation quality control.  Some words are left untranslated when in previous releases they were.  Some words are translated inconsistently episode-to-episode, especially ""onii chan.""  There are episodes where ""onii chan"" is translated in one scene but not the next.  Heck, there's even an episode where an adult woman calls a character by their name, but the subtitles put ""onii chan.""  There's also at least one episode where all the subtitles pop up ~10 seconds late.

It's incredibly frustrating to be a fan of Super Sentai and when I finally get a chance to spend money to buy official releases the DVDs I receive are lower quality than what online fansubbing groups previously released for free.  It's especially frustrating when I found no fault at all with the previous release of Dairanger.

On the subject of the Kakuranger itself, I'm finding it okay.  If you find the first few episodes too light hearted, the show becomes more serious in tone with the introduction of a new character not too far into the series, so keep watching.",1464048000,10,1731,4.9411764705882355
7634925,4,B01BHCPQSK,"I enjoy Kakuranger for two things: the ninja element and mythology (youkai).  That's right-I find it quite interesting that the villains are based off Japanese motifs and folklore.  The martial arts action is smooth, and 53 episodes-get this for your shelf!  The only negative is the age it is-not the best effects.",1463961600,,315,5.019230769230769
7634926,3,B01BHCPQSK,"This DVD set has definitely improved since the Zyuranger release. I skipped Dairanger since I already had a copy. I didn't know at the time that it was a bootleg, but it was the same quality as the official from Shout Factory it seemed.

There was a lot of work done to restore the episodes to make them look good on modern TVs, and it worked. The episodes sometimes look a little too good since you can see some of the wires and edges of the set.

The issue I still have is wirh the subtitles and translations. There are a few mistranslations, and some words/phrases aren't even translated at all. There are fans out there making better translations that are more accurate, easier to read, and even give some notes to help keep stuff from getting lost in translation. These people do the work for free. Shout Factory should really hire them. Then this would be perfect.

Still, it's hard to beat having such easy access to Super Sentai. As long as they keep improving, I hope they keep making more!",1463875200,5,999,4.478021978021978

Now, other than general aesthetics, I can just about guarantee this set will be about 99% the same as the other 2. That's not a bad thing. The other 2 sets were great, if bare. This will have all of the episodes of the series with subtitles in English. A typical Shout! Factory release for a show like this.",1457827200,8,410,4.48
