8275147,5,B0019SQI76,"Alas, too short on the running time, but quintessentially Giger.
Genius.
A bargain and a must-have item.",1439337600,3,104,5.176470588235294

8275149,5,B0019SQI76,"If you are a Giger fan this is your dream come true if you cannot visit his museum in Gruyerres. Although only about forty minutes in all, thats the film and special features both. You get an inside look at the incredible museum, plus Giger gives a pretty good interview about himself and his work. To me the price isn't bad considering just for a brief moment you get to go into Gigers world somewhat. A must have for Giger fans.",1311638400,11,430,4.320987654320987
8275150,2,B0019SQI76,Being a BIG lover of Gigers work I couldn't wait to see what he had to say and what sort of thing could be packed onto a C.D. This DVD is just a money spinner for the giger fund I think. Dont waste you're money..........buy one of his books instead.....GUTTED!,1284768000,8,260,4.22
8275151,4,B0019SQI76,"This video features a short interview with Giger (German dubbed to English) and a tour of the Giger Museum in Switzerland.  The price is high for such such a short feature.  Giger collectors who don't plan on getting to Switzerland soon will certainly enjoy this, particularly seeing the paintings on display (particularly the wall-sized 'Passage Temple' works).  Peripheral Giger materials have a tendency of going out of print (e.g. Giger's Tarot, Arh+, etc.), so the serious collector will probably want to purchase this despite the high price.",1227398400,14,547,5.264367816091954
