2460514,1,B000CETW4Y,"I was not happy with this purchase.

It may have some pictures and short film clips worth seeing but the presentation of it all is so tacky.  Over doing it on the video and sound effects with pictures zooming in and out which viewing could give you a headache.  When there was pictures of buildings in ruins you could hear dubbed in sounds of something burning like wood at a campfire which would overlap into the next part of the film.  It was just poorly presented and made.  Why is it so much more than other dvds?  maybe the extra money should go to film school for these guys.",1143244800,14,581,4.284403669724771

2460516,1,B000CETW4Y,"Do you enjoy those kinds of situations?  If so, watch this film.

In my opinion, there are certain things that need not be available for entertainment purposes.  This film is a prime example of sensationalism without any redeeming qualities at all.

Back in the 1960's there was a film named: ""Mondo Cane.""  At that time, the images shown on screen were shocking to me, but now, it could qualify to be shown to kindergarten children if this film (being reviewed) is to be considered as entertainment.

How can anyone say they are repulsed by the savage tradegies suffered at the World Trade Center on 9/11 if they seek out the brutality represented in this documentary.

2460519,5,B000CETW4Y,"When most American think about WWII, they all know how Jewish was tortured and killed by German, very few American know Chinese and other Asian were more brutally murdered by Japanese.  ""Rape of Nanking"" is a documentary film demonstrated atrocity committed against the Chinese by the Japanese people during WWII.  When Japanese army invaded China in 1937, Naking was the capital.  In Japanese lust for power and domination, the Japanese army brutally tortured and killed 300,000 Chinese citizens in just one city.  The Japanese soldiers killed every Chinese person that they came upon.  The Yangtze River ran red for days with the blood of thousands of corpses.  The reason the atrocity called ""Rape of Nanking"" was because the Japanese soldiers raped every female that they could get their hands on.
My grandfather was one of the 30 million Chinese people were killed by Japanese.  He tried to defend his homeland from invaders, but left behind a young wife with two children and was pregnant with their third child.  As was a tradition at the time, her feet were bound.  This made her feet extremely small and in constant pain.  She had to tend the farm, raise the animals, and grow vegetables in addition to her womanly duties of cooking, cleaning, sewing and raising all her three children.  My grandma was also born at a time when a widow was not supposed to remarry.  If she were to remarry, she would be reviled and spat upon.  She did not want to bring shame and disgrace to her family and her three children, so she never remarried.
The massacre and rape of Nanking is only one small part of what the Chinese people experienced by the Japanese invasion.  It is estimated 30 million Chinese lost their lives at the hands of the Japanese during the occupations of China.  China was not the only country invaded by the Japanese.  Most of the Asian hemisphere experienced the same atrocities at the hands of Japanese soldiers.  Countless millions of innocent lives were lost at the hands of the Japanese in their bloodthirsty quest for world dominance.
For various complicated history and political reasons, how Japanese brutally killed so many innocent lives are not well known by the rest of the world.  ""Rape of Nanking"" reminds the world what happened in 1937, we should never forget and try to prevent happen again.  I think everyone should watch the ""Rape of Nanking"" film in memory of all the innocent lives lost.",1234656000,7,2426,4.816425120772947
2460520,1,B000CETW4Y,"I purchased this DVD to show excerpts during a graduate lecture on World War Two in the Pacific. The horror of war is seldom touched upon in military history classes and I wanted my students, most of whom are active duty naval officers, to see the graphic reality of what happened in the Pacific.

This DVD was a disappointment from the start. First, the first set to arrive was defective and had no audio on disc 2. The seller quickly responded to my complaint and sent me a new one but not in time for the lecture. Instead, I accessed the DVD via the BrainMind site on the internet and was able to show it that way. Unfortunately, the video is so amateurishly done and so redundant in video and audio it looses most of its impact. The screamed voice-over is unworthy of a B horror flick, the narrator is unimpressive, unemotional, and repeats himself constantly. There are claims made that I have been unable to verify and the absence of documentation makes it easy for naysayers to discredit the events. I am not doubting all this happened. I know it did and that is why I want my students exposed to it. The problem is that the film is so poorly done that it discredits and defames the memory of the victims and will lead some to question that some of this happened.

I have elected instead to secure a copy of Japanese War Crimes produced by A & E for classroom use. I recommend viewing this dvd only as a curiosity unworthy of serious consideration.",1233187200,10,1455,4.4456928838951315

The quality of the editing is grainy, and the voice over continually repeats the same phrases, often for shock value. The photographs and content are shocking enough without hearing over and over again ""rape, torture, kill,"" in a monotone and unsympathetic voice.

Some of the old footage is good, but the film itself seems slightly exploitative and poorly produced.

2460529,5,B000CETW4Y,"OK: I'm biased. I know the producer.  But here is what you don't know. This film is hosted by Google. Nearly 2000 independent websites have embedded this film in their website for the pleasure of their viewers, giving it a rank of 149 out of hundreds of thousands of film at Google. According to Google stats, this film is downloaded over 250,000 times a day!!! Over 50 articles have appeared in the Chinese media praising this film. It has been repeatedly shown to standing-room only audiences who are typically left in shock and tears. It is an emotionally powerful film. The editor at Sina.com reviewed this film and wrote that ""the whole world should see this movie."" An editor at World Journal wrote: ""Powerful, shocking, thought provoking.""

Nor is this film Chinese propaganda. The film-maker is not Chinese and he is not associated with any Chinese groups or the Chinese government. His last film was about Hitler, and CBS called it ""mesmerizing.""

So why the bad review from the person pretending to be from Hong Kong? Listen: The producers of this film have been threatened and harrassed. Certain people have put a lot of money and a lot of effort into trying to sabotage this film, including a rival film-maker, and this is because it is the best film out there. They have tried to destroy and sabotage this film, because it threatens them. They do not want you to know the truth. They do not want you to see a great film, the best on the subject.

2460530,1,B000CETW4Y,"I hope no one seriously doubts that what happened in Nanking was terrible in the extreme. There were too many survivors and witnesses who have recorded their stories (not to mention the fact that the Japanese themselves documented much of their campaign of destruction and death) to dispute whether or not ""bad things"" went down. It was horrific, and for most of us, the depth of the depravity exhibited by those soldiers must seem almost surreal.

Unfortunately, there ARE those who want to rewrite history to make it less disturbing, some who choose to quibble over minor statistics or semantics in describing those dark days -- not to mention those in Japan who would dispute that the event took place at all. Believe it or not, it's true -- some people actually suggest nothing happened at all.

Therefore, this story must be told. It MUST be.

Having said that, I must insist that THIS film is not the way to tell it. Really. This film is such an utter bit of propogandist rubbish, that I find myself at a loss for adjectives to describe how bad it is. Well, let's put it this way -- I'm moved to actually write this review, and I almost NEVER review things on Amazon. I'm serious -- this film was that bad.

The production is worse than amateurish -- the person who put it together clearly has almost no experience editing videos. Technically speaking, the ""sins"" are legion: using the same, gimmicky transitions over and over; the repeated use of the same footage, flipping it horizontally (left to right) to try to make it look like a different scene, or looping it backwards and fowards to make it last longer; showing peaceful scenes of people walking on a bridge, and then cutting abruptly to explosions in a field, absurdly trying to make it look like this was footage of actual bomb attacks; not to mention the constant and childish sound effects which had me grating my teeth in frustration. These are not one-time things I'm talking about -- no, the entire FILM consists of these exact kinds of edits and infantile ""tricks""... Surely, all of that is annoying, and reason enough to dismiss this project as pathetically sophomoric and unworthy of wide distribution.

But what really makes me uncomfortable is that this is nothing more than sensational, voyeuristic, anti-Japanese propaganda.

YES, the Japanese (as a culture) need to be made to answer for and deal with their history in war (as do we all). YES, there is an element of Japanese culture which refuses to accept that what happened during the war (and in Nanking) was particularly wrong or even their fault. And YES, there are those in Japan who to this day seem utterly incapable of even beginning to comprehend the scope of the death and destruction that the Japanese Army wrought across China (and the rest of Asia). YES, yes, and yes again.

But THIS film, posing flimsily as some sort of ""historical"" piece or documentary (""shock-umentary"" if you will), merely intends to tell you that ""China was an innocent virgin ravaged by a barbaric Japan"" -- and by the way, would you like to see some photos of naked, raped women? Or how about some people being stabbed or shot? Anyone up for zooming shots of dead children and babies?

Let me say, it is true that there are some important photos and footage in this film -- and in a similar sense that we need archives of the Holocaust to remember those horrors and thereby educate future generations, these images (both still and movies) need to be preserved and available to all. But to present that material in THIS pitiful film, couched in rhetoric that could have been written by Japan-hating Communist Party apparatchiks in Beijing, does no one any good. Further, it runs the very real risk of adding fuel to the ""anti-Japan"" fire (actually, the ""anti-everyone-but-us"" fire) which the Chinese government continues to nurture. I'm talking of the kind of thinking that, today, makes people say that ""Japanese are a devil race"" -- to give just one example. I wish it were merely laughable, but it's much worse than laughable -- it's ignorant and dangerous.

Look, this is an important topic. History must NOT forget the horrible things that happen in every war. The story of Nanking MUST be told.

But for the love of God, do NOT waste your time or money on this one. If I could give it negative stars, I would.",1165017600,37,4336,4.715984147952444
2460531,2,B000CETW4Y,"This is somewhat tame material. What happened was an atrocity. And in no way do I feel ambivilant about the actual situation.

Not perversly but more so in a personal sense. To be taken back in time to a happening, either good or bad, and actually feel like I am there.

This video is less graphic than documentaries on the Discovery chanel. Interesting but no more informative than reading a book and looking at the pictures.

8098309,2,B000CETW4Y,"As someone who was introduced to the Nanking atrocities by this documentary in a library years ago, I remember it being an extremely powerful experience for an impressionable teenager, which set me on a quest to dive deeper into the history of the Pacific front of WWII and tell more people  about this dark chapter of history. Buying this and rewatching it with friends years later, I've noticed some issues with this attempt at documenting the ""Rape of Nanking,"" and suggest that there are better sources of information out there.

[spoilers]

One of the most unfathomable issues with this documentary is that it seems to suggest the Atrocities of the Japanese Gov't warranted the dropping of the 2 nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. Furthermore, it suggests that this action was what stopped the whole imperial project in China and South East Asia dead in its tracks. Not only is this a completely wrong conclusion, it is insulting to the millions of people who fought and struggled against imperialism for their sovereignty, as well as seemingly condones the use of nuclear weapons.

The documentary is extremely repetitive, because hey, there's only so much you can say about an all out killing fest. It portrays the Japanese army and the Chinese civilians as extremely one dimensional. There are many histories here that can be uncovered, such as resistance movements, Japanese mutiny, women's survival etc etc. However, the film is very focused on the ""rape."" This singular message is a disservice to people looking for actual answers to why this who episode transpired. War is nuanced, having a black and white view of things ensures these dark periods will most certainly repeat.",1463961600,2,1709,5.0711743772241995

8098318,5,B000CETW4Y,"It is a scandal and a blot on the great Japanese culture that they adamantly refuse to acknowledge the atrocities they committed in Nanking, in Singapore and elsewhere--where matchstick ghosts emerged from their prisons. Japanese soldiers and their government have acknowledged the atrocities, but their other words and deeds militate against those declarations.

The view that the perpetrators were heroes remains undiminished in Japan, which has never come out of denial. Official declarations and actions have always shown ambivalence about their barbarous use of sexual slaves in conquered lands. Their euphemism, ""comfort women"" likens their forced prostitutes to the equivalent of a comfy sofa or a bowl of soup. While many soldiers frankly admit to this practice as a routine during their invasion of Korea and China, a few still claim that some women offered themselves voluntarily. Their feeble efforts to prosecute perpetrators, and the way Japan has always stopped short of outrage, signal a qualified contrition.

Something absent from the Japanese heart rooted the depravities at Nanking and beyond. As this movie shows, their slaughter of innocents, where the bodies were notoriously piled high, was followed by soldiers engaged in normal, innocent pursuits: boot-polishing, dancing, reading girlfriends' mail, teasing one another.

While no high cinematic achievement, this movie goes beyond a simple, documentary-like telling of Chinese suffering by a force lacking in charity, empathy and scruples. Some characters portray that not all Chinese are good, and the invaders aren't invariably inhuman. One Japanese soldier is pained when his companions wrong a sex slave he has tried to befriend; a Chinese man compromises his principles to save his family. These are *individual* agents, even as the brutes line up to kill by fornication.

The west's entrenched principles of fairness and charity, through the Geneva Convention, caution against state-sponsored depravity; still, all who utter such ideals are no less prone to breaking them. Young Germans today feel no complicity for the genocide over which their people presided, and understandably. Perhaps Japan's leaders wait until no one remains to take responsibility for their savagery; Germany at least acknowledged its role in Nazi atrocities, and made gestures toward reparations.

This film should be compulsory viewing in every Japanese school.",1338249600,2,2420,5.601092896174864
