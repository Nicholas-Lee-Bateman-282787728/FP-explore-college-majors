8492190,5,B0063RG4JA,"Very informative for the folks, like ourselves, who feel like they are nipping as the tires of progress as they pass on by.  Listed as a DVD, we spent the first half hour trying to get results from our DVD player and TV set.  We had read the DVD container closely but didn't read the disc on which is printed ""this disc will only play on computer DVD drives.  Give us a break!  The DVDs we buy come in the large case and the CDs come in the small.  Information was clear and concise once we got over the identity crisis.  Impressed the out of state kids and got to see the grandkids the next day.  Nana proud of her new Kindle fire.",1377216000,,632,4.0894308943089435
8492191,5,B0063RG4JA,"The product does what it says; it teaches one how to use Skype step by step but some chapters are next to useless. Forgetting a password? Why because I am a ""senior""??? Also when chapter is filmed outside of computer screen (2-3 chapters) it seems a little unsteady at times as if camera held by hand. I give this product 4 stars because it does what it says and in this world that is rare. Don't expect fireworks but expect to learn to use Skype just as it says. There are some interesting things here. Also it was easy learning. Videos are to the point with not a lot of fluff. It is a great treat to see grandkids half way across America on computer...though I wish I was spared son-in-law.",1326585600,8,693,4.297709923664122
