2865287,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Brian Regan is one of the best working comics out there today.  Not only is he hilarious he is a clean comic that is very relatable.  I went to one of his shows and was sat between some Grandparents and a couple Heavy Metal Guys, if that doesn't show you the wideness of his fan base.

This DVD is great, and it is one you will be able to play over and over and it doesn't get old.  It is definetly worth your money.  I disagree with another reviewer and think it is on par with his previous DVD ""I walked on the moon"".  The only disappointing thing was the only extras on this dvd was  Brian's comedy central special which i've seen, and a brief encore which he does old bits requested by the audience.  Still I strongly recommend this dvd, he's a genius!",1187481600,,756,4.165517241379311
2865288,5,B000RF7Y0C,"I saw Brian Regan's new one hour special on Comedy Central and also live in concert.  Brian Regan is by far one of the funniest, cleanest comedians I know and this show was great.  I have to admit, however, that his new material is not quite as funny as some of his previous stuff, such as ""I walked on the Moon"" and Brian Regan Live.  If you haven't seen or heard of Brian Regan before, definitely check this DVD out and also go get his earlier stuff.  You will not be disappointed.",1187136000,39,483,4.217391304347826
2865289,1,B000RF7Y0C,"We are big fans, on his specail pre-buy anything you come out with list on the fan website.  Just watched 'Standing Up' - it's a dud.  I'd pass if I were you.
I'd measure it by saying its less than half of a new set of material.",1187049600,7,228,3.8297872340425534
2865290,5,B000RF7Y0C,"It's about time there is a clean funny comedian! I LOVE Brian Regan. His material is amazingly clever, and his facial expressions are just to die for. I believe this is for all audiences-even if you like crazy comedy that kids should not see. It's amazing. Better always in person-but just the funniest thing I have ever in my life seen. I would recommend Brian to anyone and everyone.
You'll never regret getting this dvd-and it will probably end up being on of your favorites! It NEVER gets old and you can watch it over and over again and laugh at the same stuff.",1184716800,11,566,4.451923076923077
2865291,5,B000RF7Y0C,"I had never heard of Brian Regan, then I came across his stand-up special on Comedy Central. He is absolutely hilarious. When I first watched it my Mom was over and I was afraid I'd end up turning it off 10 minutes into the show because of nasty language or crude content. To our delight there was nothing of the kind. And he has priceless facial expressions. He's very similar to Seinfeld - in that his routines focus on the mundane, ordinary things in life, but somehow he manages to make it funny. His bits include subjects such as TV, airlines/airports and politics. Simple ideas - with comical twists - and absolutely no language or sexual references. It CAN be done!",1181779200,65,672,4.56198347107438
2865292,5,B000RF7Y0C,"I have recently caught Regan's act on comedy central and cannot wait for the dvd release. Like the other reviews have mentioned , his delivery and facial expressions are ribhurting funny , and that to me is what a true comic is all about. There is one particular scene where he is talking about local news (i'll call it the untrustworthy anchorman skit) , oh man!! , it is so funny we have played it back LITERALLY 50 times>> I still have not erased it from my dvr. Anyway , I hope there are some xtra routines on this dvd that didn't make it on the cable showing , and maybe some other xtras as well , looking forward to it.",1181779200,6,625,4.1735537190082646
2865293,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Although I can't rate the DVD, I can rate the performance. As with all of Brian's acts, this one has simple yet witty scenarios. Brian has a way of finding small things in life that we do not think of being totally ridiculous and he brings to light the silliness we create as humans. His facial expressions are very important to his act and that is why this DVD will be so much more valuable than a CD. One of the best jokes that exemplifies his wit, recognition of the silly things we do, and his facial expressions is his joke about the people at the Antique Roadshow. This joke showcases his many simplified talents.",1181606400,8,619,4.391304347826087
2865294,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Brian Regan is a very talented comic, with very good material.  He guides you along scenarios with his keen sense of humor and delivery expertise, and really paints a picture that is enjoyable to watch and easy to understand.  He uses body language and facial expressions in his act along with wit and a unique comical perspective.  I found myself laughing quite often, which is the whole point.  I enjoyed one of Brian Regan's past performances very much, which I saw on Comedy Central, and enjoyed this one as well.  He keeps it fun and not vulgar, which may be a concern if young ones are around.  If you are even slightly familiar with his work and you liked what you saw, you may want to pick up this DVD.  He delivers the goods once again.",1181433600,10,745,4.4338235294117645
2865295,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Been a fan of Brian Regan for a long time. After years of periodically viewing his stuff on YouTube...or wherever, finally decided to pick up a copy of this very funny appearance from 2007, I believe. The airport stuff in particular is some of the funniest stand up of all time. And while not a major consideration for me (also a fan of Kinison, Rock over the years), the lack of profanity is refreshing. This could be watched at a family gathering with no embarrassment.",1492819200,,471,4.552941176470588

2865297,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Brian Regan is at his best in this show...and, that's saying something.
This rubber faced, rubber bodied comic takes all the crazy things that we all experience in our daily lives, and filters them through his goofy perspective. His unique ability to mold his features and body language to match the characters and situations he's describing make him a truly unique stand-up.

If you have already seen him, then you don't need to know more. If you haven't, then treat yourself to a true funnyman, who makes people laugh without having to drop f-bombs every other word.",1490227200,,568,4.855670103092783

We listen to his comedy when we are on our camping trips and even my teenagers love him!  I was able to see him live a few times.

Sometimes when you hear that someone is a clean comedian--you think: Snore.

Brian Regan never gets old. I just wish he's put out more DVDs! He was in our area once, and when I looked into buying tickets, there was no way we could pay that kind of money to see him live.

My one complaint would be that his DVD specials seem to all be around 45 minutes, where as most other comics are 60 minutes to 90 minutes. But, this DVD makes up for the shorter than normal set with the special feature of Brian Regan's 30 minute Comedy Central Presents set being included in it.

The huge parental thumbs-up he's received over the years, though, may've unfairly pigeonholed him.  He's more than ""just sorta funny but thankfully fine for kids to watch"" -- he's genuinely funny, kids or no, and his routines are remarkably rewatchable.

In any case, maybe 4 stars speaking for myself, but definitely 5 stars speaking for the family.  Worth buying.  Also worth seeing live if you get the chance.",1363824000,,522,4.954022988505747

2865415,4,B000RF7Y0C,Funny dialog.  It is hard to find a comic who is funny and clever instead of vulgar and classless. I hope Ryan Regan stays on this road and doesn't succumb to the latter like most comedians.  Not everyone on earth wants to continue thru life using 13 year old locker room vulgarity.  Many of us grew up and just want to laugh at daily life.,1357430400,,340,4.2

I was giggling long distance.  Lately I've decided I needed to get more humor into my life and lighten up a bit so watched this performance.  It was delightful--you will laugh out loud.  Norman Cousins healed himself of a serious illness by watching funny movies for several months.  If Brian Regan doesn't heal you, he'll certainly make you feel better.  And there's no side effects.  Any day would be brightened by spending 30 minutes with Brian Regan.",1326412800,,630,4.654545454545454

It's what I love. It's what tickles my fancy.

This however, is not that.

This is clean, it's family friendly, it's nothing that is going to offend you or anyone else.

And yet, I would put this as one of my favorite Stand-Up DVDs of all time.

Regan is able to go after topics that are extremely mundane and even topics that I feel like have been milked in comedy for all their worth and yet he's able to come up with a new point of view and make it hilarious.

Great stage presence, wonderful delivery, and he has just a characteristic of lovable stupidity when he's on stage with his different faces and mannerisms.

Highly recommended.

This is just plain and simply great comedy.",1311033600,,758,4.410071942446043
2865422,1,B000RF7Y0C,Its pathetic this guy even has a special. Everyone seems to like him because he's clean but can't you be clean and funny at the same time? I guess not. The only reason my friends and I laughed was because he was so bad. I was so embarrassed for this guy it made me feel uncomfortable the whole time. I felt bad for the people who payed money for his show or even this DVD. I wish I could remove this DVD from amazon to save people from having to sit through one of the least entertaining hours of their life. I hope another clean comedian that is actually funny comes around so people can compare and realize that he needs to retire his sad attempt at humor.,1309996800,,658,4.1484375

2865424,5,B000RF7Y0C,Funny and clean - I love this combination.  Too many comedians think they have to add in bad language to make their comedy funny - but for me that just ruins it.  Just the mention of Brian Regan's name brings a smile to my face.  I find myself telling his jokes over and over to the point that all we have to do is just say the punch line in my house and we are all laughing.  A great video for family night.,1298246400,,408,3.8795180722891565
2865425,2,B000RF7Y0C,"From reviews we had read before purchasing this DVD, we thought we would not need to worry with language at all in this video.  However, the word ""hell"" was used several times as a slang word. I know in this day and age this would not be critical for most families, but we have chosen to refrain from watching anything with any foul language whatsoever.  Our children are ages 7, 5, and 2, and foul language is just not something we want to listen to with our young boys, no matter how ""tame"" the word might be. Normally we would use Clearplay to filter out the questionable content, but a filter does not exist for this particular DVD.  Though this was surprisingly tame for something that originally aired on Comedy Central, it still did not meet our standards of ""family friendly"" entertainment. We were very disappointed that we could not watch this together as a family.

NOTE:  This review is not about feeling or proving my own ""righteousness.""  It's not about legalism.  And it's not about being judgmental of others who choose to watch it. It's about preference.  And it's about being honest in how I feel about others saying this is clean, wholesome, family-friendly comedy.  After kicking the habit of foul language myself (in large part by refraining from listening to it), I do not want to hear the unnecessary cursing that is commonplace on network television.  So... I turn it off.  And I let others know I turned this one off, just in case they are in a similar situation.",1296604800,20,1488,4.641221374045801

2865436,5,B000RF7Y0C,"I first saw Brian Regan perform live, and had no idea what to expect. I was delighted to find a comic who was not only hilarious but clean. Brian is able to take everyday incidents and relate them in a manner so funny that it really must be seen to be appreciated. As an airline pilot, I was especially amused by his observations on the world of commercial aviation: a typical announcement from the Captain explaining a delay turns into ""...Somebody put our engine in upside down, and there's only one tool in our galaxy that can fix this, and it's in Madagascar."" (The discussion of the ""essentials kit"" is also not to be missed.)

Brian talks about his kids and children's entertainment quite a bit. I was very fond of the routines involving a pitch meeting for the song ""I'm the Map"" on ""Dora the Explorer,"" as well as family outings to kid-friendly places (""Could there be a less stressful job than working in a butterfly pavilion?"") Popular culture is rightly skewered from political advertisements, to brainless members of the press corps, and even highbrow PBS favorite ""Nova,"" all to great effect.

The special is only about 40 minutes long, but fear not, there are good DVD extras, including the encore from the live show and a 30 minute Comedy Central special with great and totally different material. (The discussion of trifocals is especially amusing: ""Is that a fly on my nose? Is that a comet?"")

This is a great DVD at a great price; I highly recommend it and I especially recommend seeing Brian live if you get the chance: you will not be disappointed.",1259625600,3,1569,4.657039711191335

Brian Regan takes the everyday stuff and turns it into something hilarious! Since it is ""everyday stuff"" and a lot of it is about remembering the typical things nearly everyone did, said, saw, felt, played, misunderstood, questioned or heard as kids in America, Brian's humor bridges the gaps of age and gender. Childlike, yet mature; silly, yet somewhat intellectual - Brian Regan's humor is accessible to just about everyone. And it's clean without being preachy, political or difficult to understand! He's definitely worth the price of admission. His catch-phrases are contagious and will sweep the nation, without a doubt!

I was at first discouraged to receive the DVD and discover it was only about 40 minutes long, but if you click on the extras, you get several more small skits of his which add about another 30 minutes to the play time.

Brian Regan makes me wake them up because I'm laughing so loudly, and that's okay since he's their favorite stand-up too.  He's a little smart, he's a little goofy, he's a little sarcastic, it's all in there.  If he doesn't make you laugh without guilt, you may be broken.",1229558400,2,341,4.296875

2865451,5,B000RF7Y0C,"Brian's ""I Walked on the Moon"" is hilarious. His ""Standing Up"" is too. Frankly, when I ordered this, I wasn't sure he had enough good, new material for another. But he did not disappoint! There are those who have a few good gags and then... nothin'. Brian has a whole way of looking at the world that amuses and delights. He consistently does what all great stand-up comedians do: reminds us of things that we've all thought at one time or another and takes them to humorous and even insightful extremes. At the heart of his performance, however, is heart. You get the impression that what Brian is doing is really a labor of love. Some comedians are fueled by rage turned into absurdity. Brian, on the other hand, seems more like wonder and, yes, even wisdom turned into joy. His is comedy in the classic sense: it leaves you with the feeling that, in spite of the messiness, troubles, and absurdities of life, it's all going to be alright. Call him the cross-eyed sage or the bellowing Buddha. Brian's smile says, ""Yeah, we're all pretty confused about that, but it's okay 'cuz we're all in this together!""",1221868800,2,1108,4.601010101010101

I loved the ""STANDING UP"" DVD because you actually get two shows on one DVD!!!  Brian does ""STANDING UP"", then you go to special features and there is an encore, where he comes out and lets the audience request some of his older jokes.  After the encore, there is another half hour comedy show!  Just when you are feeling sad that it is over, you get another 30 minutes of Brian Reagan comedy!!!  If I could only buy one DVD, this would be my first one!  I have owned it for about a week and I have watched the entire DVD five times and the ""STANDING UP"" section six times because as soon as I start telling someone about it, they want to see it with me!

He takes everyday, normal situations and makes them unbelievably funny, or points out things you would not have thought of. Serving sizes on packages of food for example get the treatment here. My favorite has to be the bit about greeting cards, and a what if situation involving humorous sympathy cards. It could border on tasteless with some comics but he made it so funny I was hanging on the side of my chair. You'll never look at a blank card again without giggling in public.
In some ways he reminds me of Gallagher in some ways, pointing out things we never think about, but are insane/funny. Buy this!",1210464000,,751,4.611940298507463

Topics such as Pop Tarts, letting other drivers merge in traffic, visits to the hospital emergency room, first visits to the local gym, and Dora the Explorer are just a few of the every-day-life experiences that get examined through the lens of Regan's dry wit.  Regan's body language, hysterical facial expressions, and impeccable timing add much to the experience as well.  And unlike many stand-up comics, Brian Regan manages to get his laughs without once resorting to rude humor or innuendo.  This is a DVD we will watch often.

2865485,4,B000RF7Y0C,"Clearly beneath the veneer of self-deprecating 'dufus' Brian Regan, who's still trying to get through life 'without looking stupid' is probably the smartest comedian in the business today. His formula? Simple. A consistently hilarious act that relies on wit and a very smart crafting of vocabulary plus an outrageous take on the every-day, the mundane (""They're buyin' a CREASE!""), plus a range of body language and facial expressions that are by themselves a comedy act like no other, minus the anger and cynicism (and as already noted, the vulgarity of subject matter and profanity) that is prevalent in so many comedy acts today. But his act is anything but formulaic. Even the the familiar material gets new treatment, new twists, new surprises and it's apparent that if Regan were not keeping the act fresh for his audience, well it probably wouldn't be much fun for him either. I've seen his act live several times over the years, and this guy NEVER 'phones it in' regardless of the size or enthusiasm level of his audience. The only  reason I don't give this DVD a 5-star rating is because of the production quality/editing of the DVD itself, which looks 'made-for-TV' rushed, and many bits especially early in, seem almost as if they have a 'laugh-track' feel. As if the CC producers, in dubbing, felt a need to augment the room laughter, feels like they've orchestrated the volume and duration of the laughter for effect. Live Brian Regan doesn't need it. Unless the original dubbing of the crowd was weak due to poor mic placement or something and they felt they needed to charge it up. The result feels a little canned, lacking a little of the audience energy and spontaneity of 'I Walked On The Moon' or his self-titled Live CD. But I'm nit-picking; this really is a very good show, and his material is--as always--side-splitting in content and delivery. Bottom line is, it's well worth the purchase.

On viewing the show the second time, while laughing constantly, I also noted that his show content is pretty clean-something sort of rare in the comedy business these days.  Not a problem to have the kids in the room while he's on, and your teenagers would relate to the edgy tone.
His physicality channels Will Ferrell and Jack Nicholson that leads to a sort of Cosby take on some of the painfully obvious nonsense that is everyday life.

If you own his live CD or earlier DVD, you'll find this contains almost all new material. One of the bonus features is his encore in which he does requests from the audience from his material. It's stuff you've heard before, but the funny way he points that out is hilarious (""You're out there going, 'Yep, that's the way I memorized it.'"") His first Comedy Central Presents appearance is included and there's no repeats from the ""Standing Up"" special in it. If this is your first introduction to Brian's comedy, it's a great place to start. Grab his live CD next. The CC Presents half-hour show has some of that material on it, but it's still funny.

I wish there were more comedians out there like Brian. He manages to be funny without ever being vulgar. I don't know why he isn't more popular, but with his CC sponsored national tour maybe he'll finally get the exposure he deserves.
