6819639,4,B00PQRJ7KQ,"I'll admit i rented this at Red Box mainly because the cover art looked interesting. That being said, I'm glad i did! The film revolves around a young women inheriting a old house from a relative and the house is haunted. Normally i don't like haunted house movies but i really enjoyed this one! In conclusion, If u like this type of movie? I highly recommend it. Warning though. As u can tell by the title it is not in english and is subtitled. Thanx for reading.",1422316800,2,464,4.344827586206897

6819641,1,B00PQRJ7KQ,"Slow moving and thrill-less, ""Mas Negro"" is a dull horror flick that beats along very slowly only to conclude with payoff that's highly unsatisfying. Greta has inherited her aunt's home and her wealth, with one small caveat - she has to take care of the cat Becker. She and her three friends accept the challenge. But not only do they not take care of the cat (slight spoiler alert), they kill it. Evangeline (the put-upon housekeeper) warns, 'You have no idea what you've done.' And in most movies, that line would cue the horror. Not in ""Mas Negro."" Instead we get stilted jumps, overwrought emotion, and a handful of expected screams - but nothing close to scary or thrilling. The ending could've saved the movie. I would've forgiven it's plodding pace had the movie had a dynamic ending. Instead, it serves us five minutes of frantic activity (to make up for the 90 minutes that lacked it, I guess) and a conclusion that leaves more questions than answer. ""Mas Negro"" isn't blacker than the night. It's just dreary and dull.",1437264000,,1028,4.716666666666667

6819645,4,B00PQRJ7KQ,"A young woman named Greta inherits her aunt's mansion and naturally decides to move into it with her best gal pals from boarding school. From the get-go, the ladies find themselves exceptionally creeped out by the place. With all the dust, cobwebs, strange sounds, a maid who keeps popping up out of nowhere, and the sudden onset of ghostly visions, who can blame them. In return for giving her the mansion, the mansion comes with a creeper black cat. So apparently, Mas Negro Que La Noche is a remake of a 1970s Mexican horror classic. I have not seen the original, but thoroughly enjoyed this version of the movie. Acting was surprisingly good & I loved the spooky atmosphere. As for the storyline, I thought it was well played out for the most part. There were a couple of unanswered mysteries, but it's all good.",1430956800,3,816,4.63448275862069

6819647,2,B00PQRJ7KQ,"Take a bunch of boring, spoiled, know-nothing young women, give them an inheritance, place them inside a fake-looking studio ""house"" where nothing happens for nearly 2 hours, and what do you get?  Well, this film, which is tedious.

The attempted use of the ""cat, dead aunt and the housekeeper"" to scare the audience goes on forever.  The lighting of the film ruins the atmosphere, so does the fake CGI exterior of the house. The acting is below-standard and dull.

The lighting of the film ruins the atmosphere in the end, so does the fake CGI aunt in the house.

The film is tedious, again.

It is a remake of ""Ms negro que la noche"" (1975) which was average, but is included on a TV set a girl is watching in this Director Henry Bedwell version.  The 1975 film is directed by Carlos Enrique Taboada, who did ""Even the Wind Is Afraid"" (1968) and ""The Book of Stone"" (1969) in his trilogy of horror, all equally average and dull.",1430006400,,930,4.5

6819649,5,B00PQRJ7KQ,"I was caught up in this film right from the beginning - first by the gorgeous female leads, then by the absolutely freaky goings-on in that house.  Margarita Sanz in particular gives an iconic performance as the eerie housekeeper - a character one is more likely to see in a James Whale-directed film from the 1930s. But this is a contemporary take on a familiar story line, and I don't mind confessing that I was scared witless at times... and it was a great feeling! The music and cinematography, especially, sustain the mood of fear and dread from the opening scene all the way through the frenzied, histrionic climax (which I loved!) A wonderful collaboration by everyone involved!",1426291200,2,685,4.805084745762712

6819652,3,B00PQRJ7KQ,"In this movie we have three pretty girls, one very hot one, a snobby, dried up old housekeeper, dumb boyfriends, a super creepy mansion (I'd never go in there) and a really GREEN ghost. Oh, and let's not forget the cat that's not really a cat. Moving on...Much is not explained in this film, until...well, until never. What's up with the entity that takes on the form of a fluffy, darker than the night in bred Persian cat? (Hence the title) Is the housekeeper, with her withering, derisive, deathly gazes of disgust even alive, or are her silent appearances in many scenes indications that she's a spirit as well? Why is the hottest girl always the drug addict whore? (This goes for all movies) the Aunt...has she lived and died many times before? Greta, the girl who inherits the mansion after her Aunt dies: why does she have a ghostly dead sister, who appears but has nothing to do with the plot? How can a rave party in an old mansion look so dull? Many questions, with no answers. This movie is stylish, has some serious eye candy, but makes almost no sense. We wanted the cat (or whatever it REALLY was ) to be in the flick more. The vicious old housekeeper was the least friendly, most menacing character I have seen in a long time. She stole the show, such as it was. The very hot babe was exactly that...but she and all the other characters were completely unlikable. The dumb boyfriends didn't help either. Some reviewers have saids that nothing really happened until the final ten minutes...that is true, but the feeling of dread throughout the movie was the best part. Surely someone must die by now...uh, not yet. I was trying to figure out who would die first. As usual, the hottest girl went first. (Why do they always do THAT?) Anyway, we got it from Redbox and it was worth the rental. Many movies now don't answer most of the questions that will arise in the viewers' minds, but this one left way too many unanswered. Even though the movie didn't make much sense in the end, it was worth watching for atmospherics, some of the dialogue, and the intentional (or unintentional) humor. I give it a three. WARNING: If you love ferrets, view with caution. Enough said. To conclude, It was a strange movie, with a plot with many holes, but the eye candy (backgrounds and female) and the unintentional humor (especially the score) made it not so bad. Even my review doesn't hold together well, just like the movie. But in life, many things go unanswered, so why not in a film?",1424390400,2,2488,4.543429844097996

6819654,3,B00PQRJ7KQ,"Greta inherits a house  ""that holds many secrets"" when her creepy old aunt dies. She has one thing, just one thing she has to do and that is take care of Becker, a long haired grumpy black cat who never took on a scary face. Greta goes up there with her BFF Pilar whose brother she dates. She also takes along Maria and Vicky who both commit deeds that would hurt Greta.

We discover that Greta had a younger sister and parents who used to stay there, although we don't know what happened to them. We do find out things about the dead aunt, whose spirit doesn't seem a bit at rest. All the people have their own individual haunting and once Becker fails his swim test, things come apart in the house that is always dark and has bad wiring.

The movie seemed fine for a rental. It is typical haunted house stuff. All the girls kept wanting to leave, but then didn't. The background information could have been better explained. Good Soundtrack.",1423699200,,943,4.408045977011494

8688988,4,B00PQRJ7KQ,"How do you update a classic Mexican horror movie from the 70s? Remake it with added sex, gore, drugs and lesbian overtones! Surprisingly watchable, Mas Negro Que La Noche gives us the prerequisite bitchy millennials who love to party and do bad things. Unfortunately for them, this includes killing the black cat who watches over the spooky, haunted mansion they've been invited to stay in. Murder and mayhem ensue, naturally.
Fun, disposable, and well-acted; this one is worth a watch if you like recent gothic horror or are a fan of the original.",1503360000,,548,4.903225806451613

8688993,4,B00PQRJ7KQ,"One thing is for sure, Henry Bedwell definitely is a skilled filmmaker. Without a Hollywood budget, he puts together an atmospheric, classic haunted house tale with a good share of out-of-your-seat jumps. Reminiscent of the old Hammer productions from the 1960's, Bedwell understands that the shivers come not from the gore but from the anticipation and suspense. Well-filmed, well-edited, well directed, Bedwell can teach some of these slasher/torture porn producers and directors something about what makes a good horror film. All the staples are here, four beautiful, sexy women, a mysterious black cat, a creepy, old lady, a creaky, dusty mansion full of surprises and great soundtrack (Marilyn Manson is always a welcome addition to a horror film) a fun, entertaining ride with a sly sense of humor that doesn't cheapen the thrills. Hollywood, stop wasting your time with the same old hacks that regurgitate the same old, cheap tricks that audiences have grown weary of. Mas Negro Que La Noche showcases talents that you have yet to tap into.",1470787200,2,1047,5.1647058823529415
