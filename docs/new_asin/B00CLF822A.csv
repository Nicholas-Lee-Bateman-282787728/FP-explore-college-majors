5725998,3,B00CLF822A,"This selection of pre-code films isn't as daring as Volumes 1 and 2, but the storylines are fairly good. I purchased this set because I'm a Bette Davis fan and I don't have ""Ex-Lady"" in my collection (except for the snippet from the film that is used in ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""). Also I have ""Skyscraper Souls"" and ""Employees Entrance"" on a ""Forbidden Hollywood"" laserdisc set, so I wanted to replace them. The pre-code elements of ""The Hatchet Man"" include adultery,""hitman"" style murder, and an ending that would do ""Friday the 13th"" proud. ""Skyscraper Souls"", like ""3 on a Match"" in Volume 2, contains a fairly shocking suicide scene. Also it, along with ""Ex-Lady"" and ""Employees Entrance"", contains lots of pre-marital sex, which, of course, the Hays Code would ban in 1934. A note of interest is Hedda Hopper as Warren William's wife in ""Skyscraper Souls"", before she gained notoriety as the famous Hollywood gossip columnist.",1378339200,16,942,4.968354430379747
5725999,4,B00CLF822A,"These pre-code movies are always fascinating to me and very enjoyable.  They tell good stories and move fast.  In addition, they show the big cars we drove, the clothes, hairstyles, and the music we danced to; in some scenes, the appliances we used and prices we paid for items.  I love the late 1920s an early 1930s because my parents were young and in love then.  They told me so much about the beautiful music they sang and danced to in that era.  I have many movies on dvds from that period and never tire of most of them.  The very young Loretta Young, who stars in two of these films, remind me so much of the way my mother looked when I was growing up.  Others have remarked how much her old photos resemble Loretta Young in the early 1930s.  Of course, there was only one year's difference in their ages.  Naturally I want to see as many of her films from the pre-code era I can and I do own many of them.  My favorite in this series #7 is Employee's Entrance.  The Hatchet Man is interesting in story but also to see the main characters made up to look Asian.  If you like EARLY jazz, there's a wonderful segment with orchestra playing ""It's Love"" with Loretta and her lover dancing.  She calls it ""keen.""  Sounds similar to great Isham Jones Orchestra's recording of ""It's Love"" from 1931.  Ex-Lady with a very young, blonde and pretty Bette Davis.  Equally fascinating to me is seeing these actresses long dead now when they were young, vibrant and beautiful.  That's when women really knew how to style hair and dress, in my opinion.  Skyscraper Souls is my least favorite, but still watchable.  Wish they would continue making these pre-code films available from other studios  -- Paramount, Universal.  Tommy",1377561600,12,1722,4.543973941368078
5726000,5,B00CLF822A,"All of these movies have something going for them. I was kind of wary of having to see the great Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young made up as Chinese but, in its own way, it works as a story of morality and redemption. The leads play their characters straight, not as caricatures. Though the ""San Francisco"" Chinatown is anything but, it is still interesting and pretty believable. Loretta Young actually looks beautiful and frankly, I really like her in these pre-code films as opposed to her later, sanitized image. It's also nice to see Edward G playing a ""nice"", though dangerous, guy. Both ""Skyscraper Souls"" and ""Employees Entrance"" are the best films in this collection. Much intrigue and ""scandal"" in these. Warren William is an absolute cad and once again, Loretta is in danger with her morality. The on-the side romantic stories, there are several, in ""Skyscraper Souls"" are excellent and inventive. The skyscraper in question effects all of these stories and Mr. William is the driving force. ""Employees Entrance"" concerns ""modern"" department store operations in all of their ugliness and greed. Of course, good old-fashioned sex is a part of the story. That's where Loretta comes in. Speaking of which, ""Ex-Lady"", for all if its intended ""raciness"" has very little of it. Bette Davis is good as an independent woman who isn't interested in marriage..""the only person who has rights to me, is me"". However, the story has a conventional ending with the standard arguments for marriage. This movie is merely a preview of what was to come in her later career. At least she isn't relegated to the sidelines as in the better pre-code ""Three on a match"", which Ann Dvorak took without even blinking. However, it is the weakest film of this set, which in itself, is excellent.",1375833600,16,1783,4.9072847682119205
5726001,5,B00CLF822A,"This seventh volume of TCM/Warner Brothers/Warner Archive's FORBIDDEN HOLLYWOOD series finally makes available on DVD for the first time two of Warren William's best films, both of which were responsible for rocketing him to the top of his profession, albeit briefly.  This set, the third under Warner's Archive imprint is set to be released on factory-pressed DVD's for it's initial run, as were the previous volumes.  I was hoping that Warner Archive would release a remastered set featuring EMPLOYEE'S ENTRANCE and SKYSCRAPER SOULS with two of his other star performances, THE MOUTHPIECE and THE MATCH KING (I even contacted them a while ago), but hopefully these will also be released in the near (I hope!) future. Now on to the contents......

""Love is as useful as wings upon a cat..."" or so thinks Tong leader Nog (Dudley Digges, THE EMPEROR JONES) in 1932's THE HATCHET MAN from First National directed by William Wellman (NOTHING SACRED, A STAR IS BORN).  Edward G. Robinson (LITTLE CAESAR, THE CINCINNATI KID) stars in the titular role of as Wong Low Get, an Americanized Chinese tong assassin for the Lem Sing Tong. Except for the opening prologue, Robinson sports the tiniest of eye makeup, which can't be said for Loretta Young (ALONG CAME JONES, THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER) as his adopted ward and eventual wife.  Having to sport heavy kabuki makeup and jet black wigs, she was rewarded with a gorgeous wardrobe including a spectacular wedding outfit complete with massive headdress and a gown that sparkles as if made of a million LED's!  The ornate sets aren't too shabby either, as lavish as any MGM production.  The plot, although not very ""P.C."" at times, follows Robinson's character through tong wars, marriage, betrayals and eventual redemption, with a little help from karma and Buddha. The rest of the supporting cast is populated with mostly American character actors as Asians as was typical at that time, including J. Carroll Naish, Ralph Ince and Leslie Fenton. The print used is in great shape, probably due to it's obscurity. Fast moving with nary a dull moment, THE HATCHET MAN, available for the first time on home video, provided Eddie G. with a different take on his well-known gangster persona. Although now more of a snapshot of the times in which it was made, it still has the power to entertain in that fast-paced Warner's style...

""...half way to hell and all the way to heaven!"" is ruthless financier Dave Dwight's description of the skyscraper that takes his soul to both in the fascinatingly contemporary SKYSCRAPER SOULS (1932).  As portrayed by my fave, Warren William (on loan to MGM), Dwight's obsession with the creation that bears his name is all consuming, that is if he isn't trying to seduce virginal Lynn (Maureen O'Sullivan, TARZAN, A DAY AT THE RACES), the new secretary of HIS secretary and long-time mistress Sarah (Varree Teasdale, PAYMENT DEFERRED, ROMAN SCANDALS). Lynn is tempted but torn between ""the good life"" and her on-again, off-again randy jealous boyfriend Tom (a thoroughly annoying Norman Foster). After the success of GRAND HOTEL, MGM decided to set it's successful multiple intertwining stories plot device in the new modern marvel, the skyscraper. And what a skyscraper it is, benefiting from  MGM's usual high production standards and great art deco set decor.  Shown dwarfing the Empire State Building during the credits, the phallic 100-story Dwight Building sets the stage for plots that could be ripped from today's headlines.  Beside the usual trials and tribulations of desired, jealous, unrequited and forbidden love, the inside trading, double-crossing and financial shenanigans that ruin those that can afford it the least, are all too familiar. Populated with great character actors, the lack of an all A-level cast like GRAND HOTEL works in the film's favor. You quickly become emotionally involved with the characters' trials and tribulations. Will jeweler Jean Hersholt (GREED, DINNER AT EIGHT) ever find love with model with a past Anita Page (SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK)?  Will Myra (Helen Coburn) leave her unemployed husband for lover Slim (Wallace Ford, FREAKS, THE INFORMER)?  Is Dwight's happily estranged wife (Hedda Hopper) going to divorce him or bankrupt him first? Look close for fun cameos by veterans Edward Brophy (THE THIN MAN GOES HOME) and Tom Kennedy (THE TORCHY BLAINE SERIES). The only thing that keeps the film from being 100% classic is the cloying hammy performance by Norman Foster as Maureen's jealous ""juvenile"" (in EVERY sense of the word) love interest. Warner Archive's newly remastered print still has the occasion scratch, but is welcomed compared with previous ""as is"" releases. With surprising plot turns and a shocking ""don't tell"" finale, SKYSCRAPER SOULS will probably (and sadly) remain relevant for another 81 years......

""My code is smash or be smashed!"" opines cynical Kurt Anderson in First National's EMPLOYEES' ENTRANCE (1933) starring Warren William in another of his signature roles.  Directed by prolific director Roy Del Ruth (KID MILLIONS, THE BABE RUTH STORY), William is the ruthless general manager of Franklin Monroe & Co. a major department store whose earnings increased tenfold during his first decade. A type triple-A personality, he lives and breathes the store, occasionally stopping to seduce the new girl de jour. His latest conquest is desperate young Loretta Young (THE STRANGER, THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER) rewarded with a position after an evening of practicing a few with Warren. With the Depression affecting sales, Anderson starts culling the complacent senior staff and begins to mentor young Martin West (Wallace Ford, THE INFORMER, SHADOW OF A DOUBT) who's impressed him with fresh ideas. Unfortunately Warren's advice on women, ""love 'em and leave 'em,"" forces West to hide his marriage to, you guessed it, Loretta Young. The film's ruined businessmen, suicide attempts, seductive secretaries and uncooperative fourth floor lavatory are interspersed with sometimes un-PC vignettes (a Jewish customer turning down a pigskin football, for example). The print is great, considering, and the trailer is in better shape than usual. Peppered with the usual great Warner Brothers character actors (look for Allen Jenkins as a store detective) and a totally satisfying and mostly unsentimental ending (strangely similar to another great Pre-Code boiler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LADIES-THEY-TALK-ABOUT/dp/B008JEJSH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT</a>), EMPLOYEE""S ENTRANCE is superior entertainment.  Those running our government (and the European Union) could learn a thing or two from Kurt Anderson......

""No one has any rights about me, but me!"" So states proto-feminist artist Bette Davis (do you really need a list of her credits?) in the uneven EX-LADY, a 1933 First National release directed by Robert Florey (THE COCOANUTS, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE). Bette is having what seems to be an exclusive affair with advertising agency owner Gene Raymond (RED DUST, THE BEST MAN). Watching Raymond I kept getting the feeling that it was Nelson Eddy in disguise. Imagine my surprise while doing research to find he was married to Jeanette MacDonald! So much for her platonic feelings for frequent co-star Eddy......but I digress, anyhow this film has a Pre-Code reputation for a risque plot and salacious scenes. Although tame today, a woman openly having pre-marital sex and expousing open relationships (to her uptight father's face, no less) was hot stuff in it's day, but hot stuff alone won't carry a movie. Davis and Raymond have a circle of friends that, excepting oily rival agency head Monroe Owsley (TEN CENTS A DANCE) and the constantly 'on the prowl' wife (Kay Strozzi) of an older boiler scion, are dreadful bores. Meant to be comedic, the focus on just how boring they are has you glancing at your watch instead.  Even the usually entertaining Frank McHugh (I LOVE YOU AGAIN, ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT) is a snooze fest. Davis and Raymond eventually marry, and a scene during their honeymoon in Cuba is probably what gives it the salacious rep, and boy does it earn it (hot, hot, hot)! Unfortunately things cool for good afterwards, and the usual couplings and un-couplings lead us to the all too expected conclusion. The print is in great shape for it's age and includes a period trailer. Known as the first flick with Bette's name above the rest, she's the best thing going for it. Towering over Raymond and everyone else, young, blonde and pencil thin, you can feel the heat rising down below......

His character in Skyscraper Souls could have been transplanted to the 2000's without missing a beat.  People change less than we think.  William is paired with two lovelies: Loretta Young and Maureen O'Sullivan in his two films and it is great casting.  Throw in a couple of lesser-known films with Edward G.

5726009,4,B00CLF822A,"I purchased this collection for ""Ex Lady"" the Bette davis vehicle that was released the same week that Joan Crawford announced her engagement to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Rumor has it that this was the reason the feud between Bette and Joan started. How dare Joan take away the spotlight from an unknown Bette Davis at the time. This was the first film where Bette was getting top billing and she was thrilled for its release. Unfortunately Joan was already America's sweetheart and the news of her wedding took America by storm and Ex Lady didn't do well in the box office so a feud began and lasted over decades until the death of Joan Crawford. Personally, I enjoyed all the movies in this collection the worst of the lot was Hatchet Man though in its defense had an interesting plot, just could have been better. If you are a Bette Davis Fan, this collection is worth buying just to see Ex Lady.",1393200000,3,895,4.530864197530864

5726011,4,B00CLF822A,"Warren William is one of the smoothest and charming men in film history and this collection has two of his best; Skyscraper Souls & Employees Entrance.  If you're unfamiliar with him then you're in for a treat.  He is so outrageous in both these films that you'll find yourself staring in complete disbelief at how he treats people and talks to them.  In Employees Entrance William is about as ruthless and uncompromising as I've ever seen him.  His 'style' of firing people is hilarious and shocking at the same time.  In Skyscraper Souls he's more his usual silky, evil self as he manipulates people with sublime gusto.  His way of handling women with seductive aplomb is also a revelation.
  Then we have 'Hatchet Man' with Eddie G. Robinson.  He's so miscast here as an Asian that you'll be completely baffled that the studio stuck him in this role.  But all the Robinson intensity and passion are in full display, so that this curious and unusual film ends up being quite entertaining despite it's shortcomings.
  Then we have Bette Davis in EX-Lady.  Be advised that Bette Davis early 1930's is much different then Bette Davis post 1940's.  It's like she's two different people.  Davis is sleek and blond early in her career and this film is typical of her work at the time.  A good and interesting collection overall.",1384905600,3,1324,4.741228070175438

Compared to the other available pre-code sets out there, the Forbidden Hollywood series is top-of-the-line. There are a little more pricey than the other collections but it's really worth it for the restoration value. I highly recommend this set and the series in general.",1527120000,,419,4.833333333333333
8583057,5,B00CLF822A,"I originally rented the VHS of Employees Entrance from my local library. I was fascinated at Warren William's Mr. Anderson, the only honest character in the movie. I know, I know a real scoundrel! But he had vision and put the Privileged company heads in their place and made sure the company was successful on an employee level. As for the Forbidden Hollywood moniker,  I had first heard about this collection on Laser Disc Database. I got the laserdisc and it was fair to VHS quality but had other movies I never heard of; Three On A Match, Blessed Event, Ladies They Talk About and got totally hook. Thanks to Warner, and other Studios, I have a chance to see classics that may have fallen through the cracks.

This collection - Any review you have read is true. The picture and grain are fantastic so you know you're watching a movie shot on film. Too often a restoration removes any evidence of age and the image seems slick and flat but, not here. This has a feeling of being in a theatre and getting the movie experience we may have lost.

Price and packaging. A little high but, then again, Warner's is catering to a niche audience so the cost is in line with limited sales. This is in a standard Amaray style but has the discs on folding hub rather than on the case itself.

As to the DVD-R status. These are definitely pressed, not burned. They don't have the purple hue and have the bar code in the inner hub. I've included a picture with my disc of another Warner release ""The Boy Friend"". The difference is plain to see. Maybe these type of movies are gaining momentum and will have a much wider audience going forward.

In conclusion I high recommend this and the other sets for fans and those who want to see a slice of movie history we may have forgotten.",1518998400,,1771,4.420245398773006

Although tame today, a woman openly having pre-marital sex and expousing open relationships (to her uptight father's face, no less) was hot stuff in it's day, but hot stuff alone won't carry a movie. Davis and Raymond have a circle of friends that, excepting oily rival agency head Monroe Owsley (TEN CENTS A DANCE) and the constantly 'on the prowl' wife (Kay Strozzi) of an older boiler scion, are dreadful bores. Meant to be comedic, the focus on just how boring they are has you glancing at your watch instead. Even the usually entertaining Frank McHugh (I LOVE YOU AGAIN, ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT) is a snooze fest. Davis and Raymond eventually marry, and a scene during their honeymoon in Cuba is probably what gives it the salacious rep, and boy does it earn it (hot, hot, hot)! Unfortunately things cool for good afterwards, and the usual couplings and un-couplings lead us to the all too expected conclusion. The print is in great shape for it's age and includes a period trailer. Known as the first flick with Bette's name above the rest, she's the best thing going for it. Towering over Raymond and everyone else, young, blonde and pencil thin, you can feel the heat rising down below......
