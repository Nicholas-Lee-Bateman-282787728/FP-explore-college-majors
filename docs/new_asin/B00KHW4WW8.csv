6429732,5,B00KHW4WW8,"If you enjoy these shows you'll love it. Personally... I hate most of these shows. I think they're ridiculous and make my step-son behave and talk stupidly. However it would be wrong to give the video a poor rating because I didn't buy it for me. How silly would that review me? ""I hate this show, but I bought it anyway and now I'm giving it one star because I hate it!"" lol. The only thing that matters for this review is that He loved it. He assures me it's a 5 star dvd.",1422662400,2,474,4.053191489361702

6429735,5,B00KHW4WW8,"I am so excited for Christmas; it is my favorite time of the year. It is almost Christmas and just in time Cartoon Network has released their holiday collection.

This Cartoon Network DVD is a collection of 6 different Cartoon network holiday shows. 2 Adventure Time episodes Holly Jolly Secrets Parts 1 and 2. Along with these episodes it includes a holiday special by the Regular Show and The amazing world of Gumball. To make this video even more entertaining it includes 2 bonus episodes by Clarence and Steven.

This DVD collection is not for young children as the content contained in the DVD series does have some adult comedy that is raw and not suitable for younger audiences. The characters can be witty and comical, however very unpredictable. If you have older teens or adults then this will be the holiday DVD collection for them.

The price for this collection is very reasonable and would be a good holiday stocking stuffer. Fans of Cartoon Network will appreciate this DVD set for the holidays.",1418860800,,1010,4.793103448275862
6429736,5,B00KHW4WW8,"Not bad. This DVD has good Christmas episodes, although I think more Christmas specials could have been added to this DVD (like The Looney Tunes Show Christmas Special). Anyways, the Christmas specials on this DVD are great and my favorite has to be Regular Show.  I think this is worth getting. It would make a great gift or even a stocking stuffer.",1417478400,,350,4.645161290322581
