8176220,1,B000NA23ES,This DVD did not have all the sections too it that were promsied. I have heard horrible things about the type of treatment Vicki Sims gives. She leads people on and if her treatment or the surgery she and her surgeons recommend doesnt go well she abandons her patients!,1421280000,,269,4.510204081632653
8176221,5,B000NA23ES,"I have suffered with SI issue for close to 20 years.  I was THRILLED to find this information.  I admit the quality isn't great, but I was able to learn so much from this video on how to care for my own instability when I couldn't find a PT to help me.

I found that Ms. Sims explanations for self- correction very helpful and even though I was unsure of my rotations at first I was able to use the fix all one she explains in the video!  I appreciated that there were ones I could do on my own and ones that my family could help me with - those always seem to work better.

Once I finally found a PT I was able to share this with them.  It was really a great tool for both of us and I would buy this video again.  A great investment to understand more of what's happening in my body and how I can help myself.",1321488000,4,810,3.8727272727272726
8176222,2,B000NA23ES,"This was like watching an unscripted live presentation. Ms. Sims simply rambles on and on, as if she were talking to a group of other PT's. That's who this DVD is, overall, really for - other PT's and not the layperson. The camera work is substandard, and it's obvious the camera has been shut off and restarted numerous times, which is distracting. The background is an awful, blank yellow wall.

Part One: Understanding Sacroiliac Joint Pain and What you Can Do About It (24 minutes)

This opens with an advertisement for her book, then she goes on to talk about her first patient. She includes the information that the 18-year-old ""girl"" was ""bright, blonde-haired and blue-eyed"".

About six minutes in, the spine she's using for her demo actually FALLS OFF the holder. Rather than stop, fix it, and reshoot that part, she simply says ""oops"" and continues on holding it in her hand.

The entire 24 minutes is her talking about the various types of S-I joint pain and what causes them.

Part Two: Self and Assisted Corrections (15 minutes)

If you haven't actually been diagnosed with S-I joint pain and told exactly what type of rotation you have (anterior, posterior) then some of the exercises will be worthless to you. As someone who has had this problem for nine years and been to over fifteen doctors and alternative providers, I can tell you not a single one of them ever told me I have a problem with my S-I joint, even though I have repeatedly said that that's what hurts, described all the symptoms I didn't realize at the time were classic, and even demonstrated how I injured myself.

Some of the corrections she offers (most of which have to be done by someone else for you) are pointless unless you know exactly what type of dysfunction you have to correct. They would also need to be done on something like a massage table.

For much of this, you need to have a high enough table, know exactly what type of dysfunction you have, and have someone willing to help work on you. Unless you have the correct height of table, your helper would be in a terribly awkward position with you lying down and them trying to put their clasped hands over your hip joint and then pull downwards toward your feet.

There are some exercises in here which don't target a specific known injury, just pain. Some of them you need an assistant. There are exactly three exercises in this segment for general pain which you can also do without help.

Part Three: Taping Technique (6 minutes)

Again, you need someone to do this for you.

Part Four: Stabilization Exercises (10 minutes)

At last, something helpful to me. She uses a model to demonstrate the exercises, but there is at least one exercise (I've gotten thru seven of the ten minutes) where she fails to state how many repetitions should be performed.

In summary, if you know what type of joint pain you have and have a willing partner to help you with corrections, this may be of use to you. I'm hoping that at least the stabilization exercises will be of help to me.

I was terribly disappointed with the amateurish nature of this entire DVD. It appears it was done with little forethought and as cheaply as possible. It feels it was produced simply to make money off people who suffer with this type of pain.

At least hire someone who knows how to use a camera, and if your prop takes a tumble, take the time to fix it.",1219881600,29,3378,4.558677685950413
