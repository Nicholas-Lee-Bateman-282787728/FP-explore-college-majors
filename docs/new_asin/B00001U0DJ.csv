Rogue Trader: How I Brought Down Barings Bank and Shook the Financial World (1996)

Re: trader Nick Leeson

I recommend this book.

Who should read it:

----------

Traders: Catch the paragraphs where Leeson attempted to bully the market to go in the direction that he needed it to move (so his short options would remain OTM) and then -- when the market lurched in the wrong direction, he doubled up.  Fascinating.  There are numerous lessons here for traders, no matter which approach you use to tackle the markets.  Leeson does not provide a lot of detail about his individual trades; however, this book is intended for the mass market.  It works for that purpose.

-----------

Bank managers
Auditors
Risk managers
Accounting personnel
I recommend this book to risk managers.  If you have any position of responsibility at a financial organization that is involved in trading, this book is an essential read.  You will be stunned and schooled by the lack of accounting controls at Barings Bank.  Either his supers were clueless or they chose to ignore the indications of fraud.  This insanity ran out-of-control and undetected for a length of time that must be read to be believed.

It is notable that nobody (except Leeson) at Barings was punished for their lack of oversight.

------------

The public: I recommend this book for those who know nothing about the financial industry and trading.  This is a rare thriller because it really happened.  There are occasional market talk paragraphs which might go over your head, but (regardless of your background) you will be able to follow the story and get the plot line without problem.

The movie is fine.
Follows the book pretty well.

The DVD moves kind of fast.  If you read the book first, you will be in a better position to understand all of the scenes in the movie (which play out in seconds with little explanation).

1246609,5,B00001U0DJ,"After watching the movie Wall Street years ago, I thought that it would remain my favourite movie of all time. Although I still feel this way, this movie, Rogue Trader, is a very close second. The movie tells the true story of man named Nick Leeson, a man who single handedly broke Barings Bank, which was one of the most venerable financial institutions in England.

Nick Leeson, who is played by the excellent actor Ewan McGregor, starts off working in Indonesia for Barings Bank, but eventually works his way up, and becomes a trader on the floor of SIMEX, the stock exchange in Singapore.

The contracts that he and his team are trading are based on the Nikkei, the stock exchange of Tokyo. As the movie progresses, Nick accrues a relatively small loss from a trading error, and tries to rectify it by trading futures basically under his own account.

Unfortunately for Nick, the trades he makes only exacerbates the problem, and the losses only mount. Nick then begins selling options on the Nikkei, hoping to generate enough premium to conceal his losses. He sets up a short straddle, which means that he is betting that the market will not experience much volatility in the near term.

However, to Nick's chagrin, Tokyo experiences a major earthquake the next day, and the volatility on the Nikkei explodes, which means that the losses on his short straddle would have been immense.

After the earthquake, stocks did not fall that much right away. There was a sort of time delay, a sort of calm before the storm, before the Nikkei really started to plunge. This, by the way, was the exact same thing that happened to stocks in the United States during the 1904 San Francisco earthquake.

What I liked about this movie was the excellent acting by Ewan McGregor, and also by the actors who played Nick's management. Furthermore, the movie is really fast paced, and really well directed.

This movies delves deep into the emotional aspects of trading. You can certainly learn a great deal by watching this movie. It will show you the danger of letting fear and greed cloud your judgement, illustrates the danger of letting your ego dictate trades, and it will show you the price you pay for fighting the trend and not cutting losses.

If you are interested in trading stocks or futures, then I would say that this movie will interest you as well.

This movie gave a pretty detailed overview on how he started out, got to the bank in Singapore and got the chance to start his with his on team of employees in the trading pit on the SIPEX.

I guess the question most of the people would ask themselves is why Leeson let It com so far with his secret account to hide the losses (his 88888-account). I guess the guy didn't know pretty good what he was doing back then himself. As a trader myself, I found It interesting to see Leeson actually made most his big losses while trying to recoup earlier (smaller) losses. Once you're on a losing string it's better to cut back your trading activity for some days.
The guy certainly had some bad luck, writing a straddle on the SIMEX index futures right before a big earthquake hit in. Afterward he just kept on betting the index would recover (through ITM calls and long open futures positions) which he just kept increasing as far as I understood. In order to hide these huge losses he cheated with a signed letter and a fax machine. From this point on he just continued his cheating.

1246616,3,B00001U0DJ,"""Rogue Trader"" is based on the book of the same name by Nick Leeson and journalist Edward Whitley, which covers the events that caused the insolvency and eventual sale of the venerable Barings Bank to ING for 1 in 1995. Leeson was the inept derivatives trader who lost over 200 million of Barings' money that ballooned to nearly 1 billion as Barings was forced to sell its positions. Like the book, the movie ""Rogue Trader"" tells the story from Leeson's perspective. Leeson (Ewan MacGregor) sorted out some problems with bearer bonds in Barings' Jakarta office and was rewarded with his own derivatives department in Singapore. He was supposed to be arbitraging Nikkei futures for client accounts. But he actually took huge long positions with the bank's money, which tanked when the Nikkei took a dive after the earthquake in Kobe, Japan.

Leeson used various fraudulent accounting practices to cover up his losses and string his positions along for a while. His superiors at Barings didn't ask questions as long as the profits looked good on paper. Leeson blamed them for the losses, accusing his aristocratic employers of being stupid and so embarrassed by their ignorance of modern finance that they didn't ask questions. So it's no surprise that the folks at Barings are presented as dolts in this film. It's unclear exactly how the filmmakers want to present Nick Leeson. He was, after all, one of the most incompetent traders ever -and one of the biggest crooks. People don't get much dumber. So I'm not sure it's wise to have Nick narrate the film or to take the perspective of his book, seeing as it is the perspective of an idiot and a criminal.

This could have been an interesting cautionary tale, but its perspective is too narrow and disingenuous. We spend an hour and a half watching a guy worry about his positions. Occasionally, a stuffed shirt at Barings interjects a half-hearted attempt to figure it out. The state of Nick's marriage and his emotions are irrelevant. There are more interesting things to say about why a reputable bank put itself in the hands of a narcissistic duffer with no prior derivatives experience. ""Rogue Trader"" needs a broader perspective. Banks do entrust fast-talking upstarts with too much money. They don't always understand the intricacies of the financial instruments they deal in. And low-risk methods of making money are simply inadequate. Hence, debacles like this one. But the story ""Rogue Trader"" presents is shallow and trivial.

Thus Ewan McGregor's Nick Leeson becomes a loveable cockney who only got into this mess to save a bullied colleague's job and to save managements' bonuses without disappointing his wife or the memory of his dear old mum.

His defalcation in this capacity (to the tune of over 1.3 billion dollars) led to Baring's unexpected collapse and about 6 years of jail time for the miscreant.

While behind bars, he wrote a story of his life entitled ""Rogue Trader.""  This movie is heavily based on that book.

As for the quality of what you're getting here, I have to say the whole thing's a bit puzzling.

On the surface, there seems nothing wrong with this movie.  The acting is all fine, the directing fine, the script fine.  In theory the subject matter is interesting and the filmmakers make no obvious blunders.

Yet it's one of those movies that has so little to recommend it that months later you probably won't even be able to remember watching it.

Can't quite put my thumb on why:  I've read Leeson's book and found it entertaining in a grisly sort of way.

But here we have a movie, and a movie that simply doesn't work.

Is that because Leeson's story simply does not lend itself well to the medium of film?  Is is because the whole thing is predictable and there really aren't any twists?  Is is because what Leeson was doing was so complicated that, despite the valiant efforts of the filmmakers, you spend the entire movie more or less in a fog?  Is it because the movie contains a scarcity of people to root for?

Ewan McGregor was uninspired in his playing the lead role and the first two-thirds of the film is a slog.

1246627,4,B00001U0DJ,"ROGUE TRADER, strangely released in movie form only in
1999, (quite a few years after the actual events occurred,
back in early to mid 1990's) tells the tale, in a
simplistic and perhaps, glamorous manner, of the financial
disaster that destroyed Barings Bank, of London, England.

Ewan McGregor does a splendid and convincing job, playing
Nick Leeson, while the lovely  Anna Friel plays his spouse.

The story is told very well, from starting to end, and
humanly inter-mixes the personal with the professional
aspects of Leeson's life, evidently to take the point of
view of the perpetrator and make the fraudster more
likeable, more excusable, perhaps more like everyone else in the
general public. To make the movie less tecnical, less
calculating in the devastation sewn by Leeson among the
general public, such as the bank itself collapsing, and the
former employees losing their livelihoods, the story has
to shows the bright side to all this.

On the one hand, the movie is simplistic, and suceeds
in entertaining the viewers, for the duration of the
movie, courtesy of the actors, and well organized sets
that are filmed realistically, keeping the action moving.

Unfortunately, movies like these do nothing to suggest in
the minds of the public that something needs to be done to
prevent the repetition of similar acts of misconduct, and
they forget to  underline the seriousness of the behavior
that occurred. Much like gamblers at the casino, who often
didn't have trouble earning their petro-dollars and have
no qualms in losing much or all of it, Leeson as a commodities
speculator, saw no error in doing the same thing, gambling
on commodities, and losing almost all of it, despite some
obvious trading acumen.

Worth the rental, with merit to the actors.",1168992000,,1769,5.017064846416382

McGregor's natural charm makes Nick seem far less culpable than he really was, despite the actor sleepwalking through an appalling script with some of the worst dialogue I can remember. Inept - or rather TV-movie-clumsy) direction doesn't help. There can be some forgiveness for ""true"" movies that invent episodes or make real-life characters to push a story along; there can be none for a movie that tells such a shallow version of the truth via its story's least interesting (if pivotal) character, and over-casts to make a boring futures trader look like a star.",1131667200,3,797,5.045454545454546

An incredible aspect of this case was  how Leeson covered up for so long, and fooled  so many, who it seemed, were so wrapped up in their own company rhetoric they simply wanted to believe in Leeson. The regional manager in Singapore had never even heard of the name of the brokerage house Leeson used to ""invent"" a trade to cover the missing and ever increasing deficit being incured in the ""88888"" account, a supposed customer account, but in reality, an back office error account.
The pace of the story is very well done here. My only gripe is, for a film with excellent supporting cast, why did they take so little care over the choice of the leading players? Ewan McGreggor is convincing as Leeson only when the sickly scenes with his wife are not on screen, the hoplessly miscast Lisa.

When I first heard about Rogue Trader, amazingly I actually remembered the true story behind it too so I was excited to see the film.  The film itself is both exciting and sad.  You see a young hot shot getting in over his head in more exotic locales and how far he goes to cover up--to the failure of the British home company.  If you want to bring morals into the picture you can see the exact moment where he crosses the line, telling a lie that he can only embellish and make worse until ka-boom, it all falls down.  So basically the film doesn't in my opinion glorify the actions of the main character.

It had some high energy points, especially when you Ewan McGregor begins to literally lose it as the option selling losses mount. You also see his duplicitous nature in his personal life and his professional life. There is nothing stop the train wreck coming.
A couple of things I didn't like was the misaccurate representation of this being like the stockmarket. The Singapore International Monetary Exchange is a futures and spot market for currency exchange. There were more intense elements that could have been brought in. This is an international scandal where are the Singapore regulators etc. every antagonist needs a solid protagonist and there wasn't one.
I have been involved with futures and options trading for the past 11 years. I know how intense it is to watch the screen as money ticks away from you. This just wasn't easy to convey in the film

McGregor portrays Leeson as a charmer white collar criminal who ended up sentenced to six years in a Chinese prison for insider trading and fraud.  Diagnosed with cancer, Leeson wrote his memoirs and low and behold it became a film.  Ewan McGregor plays the self-absorbed, arrogant Leeson with his usual competence and energy.

To me that was the best part of the story.  How procedure and process is overlooked as long as the 'profits' keep rolling in and the incredible sense of arrogance and invincibility of the elite and powerful.  Trades not verified, faxes accepted at face value, funds transferred out of fear rather than sound judgement.
And I found the film rather uncomfortable to watch.  A true credit to McGregor's performance.  It's almost like I could feel the weight of the incredible strain that he was under.  Yet he (Nick Leeson) was also naive and arrogant enough to believe that he alone could move the market.
Although I don't know how true to the facts this film was I certainly felt like the events and atmosphere were honestly and objectively presented.
Unfortunately a film like this, as outstanding as it was, is not a film that I could see myself viewing over and over again.  So definitely of 5 star quality but not necessarily a purchase.",985305600,36,1101,4.697916666666667

1246647,5,B00001U0DJ,"This film must have gone direct to video in the US because I don't remember seeing a listing for it in theaters.  This is a true story of Nick  Leeson which it seems is somewhat controversial in Europe, especially in  Great Britain.  It is always difficult to depict a story from the headlines  without controversy, because so many people have already formed opinions  about the events from media accounts.  This film was taken from Leeson's  book, and therefore it depicts him favorably as not such a rogue after all.  I'm certain that based upon the emotional reaction to the Barings Bank  fiasco, this must have outraged a lot of people.
Here in the states, this  news apparently was not quite as sensational as in Europe.  Honestly, I  must admit that when I was watching this movie, it took me a while to make  the connection.  I remembered Barings, but not Leeson's name.  I had no  recollection what happened to him.  Since I only knew part of the ending,  that made the movie more enjoyable.  I suspect this might be the case with  a lot American viewers.
This was a terrific film.  Ewan McGregor was  fabulous as the rogue.  You like him right away, with his wide eyed  ambition and determination and his blue collar work ethic.  He brought  great energy to the part and handled the broad range of emotions of his  character with great skill.
The story was electrifying and (if you  weren't already familiar with every detail) sucked you in with the  anticipation of what he would try next to extricate himself.  Of course,  the story was told from Leeson's perspective and it made him very human,  almost romantic and a victim of circumstance.  I'm sure this was overly  kind to him, but from the standpoint of enjoyment of the film, it worked  well.  Dearden's direction was well done, especially the madness of the  trading floor.
My only criticism of this film was the audio.  I found it  very uneven with a lot of dropped dialogue that faded into inaudible  mumbles.

The bad acting was caused by actors who did  not know what they were saying when they were uttering their lines (e.g.  margin accounts, variation margin).  And by wrong format I mean instead of  trying to explain derivatives through the plot, they should have had a  narrator explain instead.  For instance, at one point the back office  clerk asks Nick, ""What's the difference between ""initial margin  and variation margin?"".  Her delivery is so bad that it is obvious she  was scripted to ask the question so that the audience understands this  crucial difference later in the movie.  Needles to say, I love the subject  matter, and that made up for the bad acting, lame lines, and British dental  issues.
