8562325,3,B00B4HLZFM,"A wonderful 50s movie with Robert Taylor about gamblers, relationships and risks. You can see it well through the cigarette smoke and wonderful old cars. A great movie for a lazy afternoon.",1409011200,,189,4.9375
8562326,4,B00B4HLZFM,"Doesn't seem like much today - when post traumatic stress disorder from  war time experiences - are openly discussed, but when this was made it was not discussed or mentioned.  So this was a bit ahead of its time.  Deals with a WWII and Korean War pilots inability to fly any longer.  Through in a little bit of international intrigue and you have a decent film.",1398902400,2,362,4.4393939393939394
8562327,4,B00B4HLZFM,"Tip on a Dead Jockey looks at the plight of a veteran pilot who is suffering from what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder. Lloyd Tredman (Robert Taylor) has decided to drift along in life, hiding away from family and friends in Madrid. His wife (Dorothy Malone) was about to divorce him, at his request, but changes her mind and goes after her man. Taylor is living on the fringes of Madrid society, giving rowdy parties and avoiding work. He is also carrying on a mild flirtation with his neighbor (Gia Scala) wife of his service buddy (Jack Lord). After losing his shirt when a jockey is killed during a race, Taylor is handed an offer by Martin Gabel--a simple matter of flying some currency from one point to another--illegal but not dangerous. He at first refuses then accepts the offer to save Lord from doing it and becoming a criminal. Taylor has to overcome his terror of flying to help his friend. Marcel Dalio provides some comic relief as does Joyce Jameson as a drunken lady who doesn't know how she ended up in Taylor's bed. Nothing goes smoothly, of course. Drugs enter the picture and Taylor has to decide what he will or will not do. The film was originally scheduled to be directed by Orson Welles but he dropped out and Richard Thorpe took over. Not a great film but solid entertainment done professionally by a very good cast.",1373500800,5,1354,4.599173553719008
8562328,3,B00B4HLZFM,"I always liked Robert Taylor, but this was not one of his best. Except for the last 20 minutes, it is a very unexciting and not very interesting melodrama. It looks like Taylor just went through the motions, plus he looks rather old and tired. The best one in it was French actor Marcel Dalio. Unless you are a die hard Taylor fan, I would say skip this one.",1370390400,,358,4.202898550724638
8562329,4,B00B4HLZFM,"Tip on a dead jockey - is an enjoyable movie, if when you are watching it  you remember it was made in the 1950's.
Robert Taylor, was always (to me at least) a bit stiff and unemotional, just spoke the words, lacked any emotion.
Dorothy Malone just the female interest Gia Scala much better.  Anyway I brought it for Jack Lord.  Plays Robert Taylor's war friend, in and out of the movie  not a big part but enjoyable to watch.  Movie fans who like watching old movies will enjoy it.",1369526400,2,482,4.311111111111111
