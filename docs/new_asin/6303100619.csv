7837532,5,6303100619,"The acting, not only of the main character, Duncan, but of the people he interviews at the construction site made this film for me.  The people came across as ""real"" and most definitely didn't seem like their parts were overly rehearsed like on other children's shows.  A great video for kids (or anyone for that matter) who enjoy watching 'mighty machines' moving Earth and building things.

This provided hours upon hours of entertainment for my friends and I.",1109289600,,462,4.897435897435898
7837533,1,6303100619,"My 2 year old, who has watched ""Big Equipment Farm Machines"" dozens of time, wouldn't sit still for this one.  There are too many MTV-style quick cuts, making it hard to follow any scene for more than a  few seconds.  Most of the people interviewed (and there are a lot of them)  seem to be adlibbing(and poorly at that).  The characters of Duncan and the  Owl are hilarious, though, but not in the way the producers intended, I'm  sure.",961977600,3,437,4.455696202531645
