2693022,5,B000KJU1JG,"I come away from this film realizing to what extent the musician is in the work of art that is being created on the spot, with each performance. Music is a miracle, and live performance of great music really is sublime. And it's all done by people who, like me, enjoy being an audience. Watching these musicians enjoy the superb performance of Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" by the accordionist is a high point in this for me. Seeing the DePue brothers play bluegrass, watching the trombonist play with the salsa band, enjoying the violinist with the children at their school, made viewing this film special and important. The segment on the role of the conductor was enlightening. I am grateful to have this.",1184976000,12,703,4.770491803278689
2693023,5,B000KJU1JG,"I watched this incredible dvd several times in recent months, including one of the
extras, which is a great radio interview of the filmmaker and the principal first and
second violinists of the Philadelphia Orchestra. 5 stars isn't a high enough rating - this
is more than a must see for (classical) music lovers.

  In my experience this is a totally unique production. Interesting, entertaining, intimate,
thought-provoking interviews of professional orchestral musicians are the main focus,
interweaved with many scenes of the musicians in live performances, in rehearsals as an orchestra
or in smaller groups, as well as in other venues, playing chamber music and also non-classical
music - I'll pass on the bluegrass, but the scene with the trombonist playing Latin music was
great! These fine musicians discuss their craft and music itself from many points of view. The
interviews are done sometimes with only one musician, other times in groups. And of course
either in the background, or in the foreground, we are always hearing great classical music.
I felt like on some level I was really getting to know some of the musicians, through the
magic of music, and because of the depth, directness, and honesty of their comments. There
are so many inspiring, insightful comments, so much music packed in to this 90-minute
production, along with interesting travel footage of the orchestra in Europe and Asia.

  A few of the comments/scenes I noted:
  a) ""You can't define great musicianship, but you know when you hear it.""
  b) We might think that musicians are competitive (and they are sometimes!), and yet on
the dvd we hear otherwise. One violinist comments on how blown away he was when he heard
Sarah Chang play a Paganini concerto when she was nine. He and another musician express not
envy but are rather deeply inspired by her phenomenal talent.
  c) The amazing story of the concertmaster, David Kim, who didn't quite make it as a
soloist, but still feels he has fulfilled the expectations of his deceased Mother. The music for
this entire scene is Schubert's Cello Quintet, which Kim calls ""pure ecstasy,"" and we feel
the same feeling in our own way, through the beauty of the music and the playing (he with
other members of the orchestra).
  d) One of the percussionists makes a statement near the end of the dvd that music
expreses something Divine.
  e) Another musician, who is also an artist, comments about the timelessness of
the music, that playing (and listening) is like time-traveling, and she feels like she
knows the composers in some way.

  Words can't really convey the depth of the experience of watching this dvd, but I
don't think a person can appreciate it unless they like classical music. One other excellent
production feature is the very visually-appealing, spatial arrangements of the musicians
during rehearsals, so much more interesting than the normal look of an orchestra on stage.

  This is better than a 5-star production, but I would have appreciated it if the
title of the pieces were displayed so I would know exactly what I was hearing (though
some of the pieces are recognizable). The names of the pieces are listed at the end
of the main feature, but I think they omitted several, like the Debussey piece that
was so well presented, along with an insightful explanation about connecting sounds and
impressions.

  As mentioned at the beginning of the review, one of the extras, the radio interview of
the filmmaker with 2 of the principals, gives more insight and enjoyment into the music,
the music process, and other things you will see for yourself when you watch it.",1182556800,39,3626,4.9243421052631575
2693024,5,B000KJU1JG,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I knew I had to have it. It was so moving and insightful, I walked on air as I headed home. As a musician, it reminded me of why I do what I do. I watch it over and over.",1179273600,10,230,3.358490566037736
2693025,5,B000KJU1JG,"This documentary attempts to answer the question ""What is music?"", through the members of the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Sometimes the musicians discuss this as a group, or some give individual reflections on the question.  There are many varied responses, and there is no absolute answer.  It really demonstrates the common bond that music has in it's most basic sense, as some of the musicians demonstrate their affinity for all kinds of music.

Whether you enjoy classical music or not, if you DO enjoy music, this movie is sure to please, and sure to make you smile.  Definitely a movie that can be watched over and over.",1170720000,21,623,4.895238095238096
2693026,5,B000KJU1JG,"Very enjoyable, sweet, sometimes moving  documentary about the lives and approaches to their music of members of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra.  Its an extremely insightful film at times, although sometimes it stays a little on the surface (it could actually use more running time!),  and talking about music is sometimes simply hard to do,  But the eclectic group profiled shows well how very different members of the larger hive of an orchestra can be, while still bringing themselves together to create something larger and more majestic than their own talents. Some lovely, well-photographed music of various kinds.  Educational and original.",1294012800,,652,5.48

2693028,5,B000KJU1JG,"I grew up on ""Those Fabulous Philadelphians""!  They still are.  This is a truly unique perspective of a world class Symphony Orchestra.  I view ""Music From the Inside Out"" many times, and have been giving it as a very ""special"" gift to those friends who I feel will get the same enjoyment from viewing it as I have.

2693029,5,B000KJU1JG,"I do like this DVD.  However, I would have enjoyed it more had there been a little more music and a little less talk.

It was interesting to hear from the various musicians, and I wouldn't have changed that for the world.  So, perhaps, the DVD should have been just a little longer to incorporate more of the musicians talent in an orchestral setting.",1278374400,2,351,4.453125
2693030,5,B000KJU1JG,"This film was produced after a devastating Philadelphia Orchestra strike. It apparently helped to heal the orchestra members, and gave us a memorable film in the process. It entertainingly explores questions like, ""What is Music,"" ""How is music related to the other arts,"" and ""What does music contribute to my life."" Profound, inciteful, funny, and always entertaining,this is a gem of a movie. I saw it first at the movie theater, and was thrilled to be able to buy it on DVD.",1265760000,3,478,4.841463414634147
2693031,5,B000KJU1JG,"A touching, informative look at the individuals who make up the Philadelphia Orchestra.  Anyone who loves classical music, or any kind of music, will find this film to be exceptional.  Learning about the wide-interests of an orchestra's members is extremely appealing. The music that is heard is beautiful.",1227398400,,306,5.354166666666667
2693032,3,B000KJU1JG,"The film's unusual approach of attempting a behind-the-scenes presentation of musicians' personal stories somehow raised expectations for me that were not met. I agree with another reviewer that most of musicians' observations were banal (in fact a couple of them note that their attraction to music may be linked to not being especially articulate verbally). In no way is this a reflection on these very intelligent, likeable people, whose musicianship is beyond reproach, but rather on the filmmaker, whom we trust to provide a stimulating script. Perhaps if he had asked them questions about specific pieces of music or composers, he might have elicited more interesting comments.
I also agree with the generally less enthusiastic reviews of this film on Netflix, in misliking the absence of identification of the pieces being played or heard in the background. Names of people and of cities appeared on the screen, why not also the music?
I felt the film did not hold together well. The unifying theme is there: the musicians as people with ordinary lives that include playing in one of the world's greatest orchestras. What is not unified is the method, a certain cinematic integrity, for the film jumps almost randomly from setting to setting. For example, many cities are identified to show us that the orchestra is on tour, and then (with a couple of exceptions) nothing happens there. Another example is the wonderful full orchestra finale, which is marred by interruptions for yet more individual comments.
The personal anecdotes make Music from the Inside Out definitely worth watching, but do not expect to learn much about music or, for that matter, orchestras.",1225584000,3,1674,5.135531135531136
2693033,3,B000KJU1JG,"I wasn't that thrilled with this.  Although I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes aspect of life in a first-class professional orchestra, I didn't get nearly enough of that, and I was not so much interested in the musicians' lives away from the orchestra.  By example, a good chunk of time was spent with a horn player talking, not about horn, but about long distance running.  Not about how it relates to music making, but just about running.  ??

I also think the film needs some organization to the material--even if it were somewhat arbitrary, i.e., following the orchestra for a season, or on a particular tour, or preparing a particular work.  The film just begins and ends, with no real new understanding of this life.  It seems completely lacking a point of view.

There is the discussion toward the end of the film on ""What is music?"", which - had we started with that - might have been the organizing principal here, the string that held the beads together.  As it is, that discussion is distinctly banal, with answers ranging from ""organized sound"" on one end, to ""the divine"" at the other, pretty much undergraduate stuff.

Lastly, I think it's very telling that the most exciting piece of music in the film is NOT the Philadelphia Orchestra - but a street musician playing Vivaldi (amazingly) on an accordion.",1210809600,18,1316,4.783185840707965
2693034,5,B000KJU1JG,"After watching this beautiful film, it's impossible to hear recorded classical music and dismiss it as pleasant aural wallpaper.  Now there's a musician and a passion behind every piece, a community of real lives behind every note, and professional orchestra players who also make art, run marathons, and fiddle in pubs. You don't have to love classical music to watch this movie, but it's certain it will kindle a spark for music-making of all kinds.",1203724800,3,451,5.013333333333334
2693035,5,B000KJU1JG,"Our daughter alerted us to this movie when it was first released. We absolutely loved it, and everyone who saw it on our recommendation was grateful to have seen it. We have given the DVD as as present several times, with the same reaction. It is the story of musicians in the Philadelphia Orchestra ""from the Inside Out."" The last person we gave it to recently watched it twice.",1196553600,4,379,4.507246376811594
8157696,3,B000KJU1JG,"I'm an elementary school music teacher, and I bought this for my students to watch. I hoped that it would help them in choosing a band instrument and inspire them to play music. Unfortunately, I found it pretty boring. I couldn't get through it, and turned it off about 2/3 the way through. It might be good if you need some time to kill or have a sub for a music class, but the beginning isn't appropriate for the little ones because of some gratuitous crotch shots during a salsa dancing part. Don't know what the video editor was thinking there.
Anyhow, there are better educational videos on the market. I didn't see what all the hype was about.",1507766400,2,649,4.46218487394958
