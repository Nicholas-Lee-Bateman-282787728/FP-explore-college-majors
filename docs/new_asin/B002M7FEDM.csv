8373596,5,B002M7FEDM,"Leung Kar Yan is great, though he's minus the beard, but in my opinion the stand out fighter is his teacher Yasuaki Kurata (Heroes of the East).

Honestly, much better than 'Fearless'; the last fight in 'Legend' is pretty impressive.

As Mantis wrote, and also Morgoth in his review of the Secret Master VHS, this movie really could not do anything different that would make it better.

I also own the Bonsai DVD and its really the only version you can find, and while an excellent film, its unfortunately full-screen with English dubbing (apparently there's a Taiwan DVD from League Media as well but it looks like it wouldn't be of a better quality). Also known as 'Secret Master' on VHS.

Nonetheless, I highly recommend this film, and though not the all-time best of the genre (I enjoyed Five Element Ninjas, Ninja in the Dragon's Den, etc. more), I'd consider this a top 20 favorite of mine.

8373597,4,B002M7FEDM,"This is essentially the same story as Jet Li's ""Fearless"" (2006), about Chinese hero Huo Yuanjia.  Yuen Woo Ping (""The Buddhist Fist""), who choreographed the action in ""Fearless"", directed this film but let 4 of the other Yuen brothers handle the fights, including Yuen Yat Choh (""The Miracle Fighters""), who plays the younger Huo Yuanjia, here called Fok Yun Gap.

Phillip Ko Fei (""Tiger Over Wall"") plays a kung fu master who won't allow his youngest son to learn the family's style. Yasuaki Kurata (""Heroes of the East"") plays the boy's tutor, who secretly teaches him how to fight. After spying on the father's kung fu for awhile, Kurata returns to Japan, leaving the boy with a fighting manual and some words of inspiration. The boy continues to study, and soon the actor playing him turns into Leung Kar Yan (""The Victim"").

While not perfect, I can't think of too much that would've made it better.  One flaw might be the casting of Leung Kar Yan, who is always good, but lacks the technical expertise to adequately portray his family's original style, whereas Phillip Ko Fei possesses that ability and then some.  Apart from that, the fights and story are very good, the humor is minimal (and kinda funny when it does occur), and the characterizations are rich and well performed (especially Kurata's). Why this has not received a mainstream release is beyond me. Quite simply, this is a classic!

The DVD is a bootleg from Bonsai Media, with a running time of 89 minutes.  While I normally would hesitate in recommending their releases, sometimes they're the only way.  Hong Kong Legends is supposedly the version to get but I'm aware of NO all-region release.  Here, the picture is remastered (unfortunately more like Xenon than Celestial) and is oddly fullscreened, but it's not a big deal and commits little viewing harm.  English-dubbed only.  4.5 out of 5 stars and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
