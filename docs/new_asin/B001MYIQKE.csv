8322449,5,B001MYIQKE,"I haven't watched all the videos, but the ones I have watched have been exhilarating. I don't think anybody else has ever used this style of storytelling. What they do is they get someone who, for instance, tried smuggling heroin to some country abroad, and was caught and went to jail. They interview this person, and while she is telling the story, they have actors play out the scenes of the story in vivid detail in a frame separate from that of the interviewee. Breathtaking stuff! You really feel with the characters during the episodes because the events are essentially what happened to the interviewees in real life, even though they are portrayed with acting.",1333497600,2,669,4.826086956521739
8322450,2,B001MYIQKE,"Many are not ""locked up"" stories, but a monotonous series of tourists being kidnapped and drug through a forest. 3 stories were identical and I thought I had either mistakenly replayed a disk, or their was an error in its manufacturing. I cannot recommend buying this product.",1325116800,3,276,4.8936170212765955
8322451,5,B001MYIQKE,"Although it doesn't say it on the Amazon listing or on the actual product, this set is basically all of the episodes of Season 2. Currently, Seasons 1, 3 and 5 are not available. Season 4 is available on Amazon on DVD-R only. This is the only DVD set you can buy currently. Locked Up Abroad is a great show and this set is a must-have for any fan!",1309305600,6,347,4.043478260869565
8322452,4,B001MYIQKE,"Its hard to watch a single episode and not see the attention to detail the producers took to recapture the events that took place, 4 stars because not all the episodes are included",1265587200,2,180,4.484848484848484
8322453,5,B001MYIQKE,"I'm too busy to keep up w/my dvr and often miss these when they're on nat geo, but if you're a fan of locked up abroad order these today! It's a great show, although I could do without the poor people who were just in the wrong place at the wrong time stories-those are very sad. I prefer the stories about people making bad decisions & getting caught up in a foreign country.",1253664000,2,376,4.164383561643835
8322454,5,B001MYIQKE,"Love, Love, Love this DVD! I am so addicted to this program. Great true stories that illustrate human courage, regret, redemption, and the will to live.",1251244800,,152,4.884615384615385
8322455,5,B001MYIQKE,"Anyone who has seen an episode already knows this is a gripping show about travelers and ordinary people that either suckered into or forced into a very bad situation. The reviews I find the most helpful list the episodes so here they are:

Disc 1:
Chechnya

Korea

Disc 2:
Bangladesh
Philippines
Kuwait

Disc 3:
India
Pakistan
Lima, Peru

8322456,5,B001MYIQKE,"I watch this series on Nat Geo alot and of the 12 episodes here, these are in my opinion, the best of the best. Some episodes I have never seen before.  Wish there were more in the set.",1237939200,4,185,3.8684210526315788
