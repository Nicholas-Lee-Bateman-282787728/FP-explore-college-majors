I wish I could go back in time and not see this.  It made me feel sad for her.  I'm sure her fans would point out that she wasn't given much to work with in this movie and I have no doubt that's true.  Still, I suggest you skip this one even If you're a Rebecca De Mornay fan (especially if you're a fan).",1426636800,,514,4.0495049504950495
8610445,3,B00EYTDQJA,"3d makes the difference on this one.  the movie was shot in 3d and because of that it gives plenty of depth and such.  In fact because it was shot in 3d it looks a lot better than 'jumper 3d'  or 'spiderman 3d""  because post processing will never compete with a real 3d experience.  The movie was in limited run in 2013 and it never played in Colorado where I lived. It features Rebecca demorney as a drunken musician who has basically ruined her daughters lives. They one by one flee her to live in the evil apartment. This is a low budget flick for sure. WIth a small amount of special effects but the scene with a falling woman in 3d looks awesome!.  The film was also shot in hd and that makes it look even better.  The story involves a haunted apartment and evil ghosts. This isn't a A movie by any means , but it's a simple movie shot on location in Detroit. one of the worlds most dangerous cities , But ironically the apartment is in the good part of the city!. The acting is fine and I don't buy people who slag actors who are doing a decent job in a  low budget flick. The film in 3d is well worth watching , but in 2d , it's just a average straight to video low budget deal. But certainly I have seen much worse than this one. 3d makes this one. And to watch this on 3d here you need a all region 3d blu ray player. You can get one on amazon.com.  I have a orei , which plays all dvd's , blu rays and 3d blu rays from anywhere in the world. So , if you buy this in 2d it will be half the movie I saw in 3d",1385856000,2,1516,3.9120521172638436
