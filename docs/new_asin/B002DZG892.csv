8366528,5,B002DZG892,This was an excellent class on how to play a common piece. Scott takes you from simple to advanced with great explanations and guidance. I thoroughly enjoyed it!,1395878400,,161,4.785714285714286
8366529,5,B002DZG892,"Scott Houston has expanded my piano playing skills. I'm learning to play from a melody line and chord names after many years of playing from printed music. It's just the most fun! This video teaches you the song in different levels--just the simplest version for beginners up to a soft jazzy version for those ready to ""play more notes."" Now, I mix up the two styles, adding in my own touches to printed music.

If piano lessons are a painful memory for you, you might give this a try. Yes, you will still have to practice but you will play the full song pretty quickly. If you never had the chance to take piano lessons, here is a chance to play now. This is just one song, but there are others in the series.

Also, check out The Piano Guy TV series on PBS and look for his videos on YouTube.",1386547200,,794,4.251655629139073
8366530,5,B002DZG892,"SILENT NIGHT - a tune familiar to all.  I am a senior citizen (age 71),
listened or sang this tune hundreds of times and have never played a note
in my lifetime.  Now I can play the basic version of Silent Night thanks
to Scott Houston's one on one DVD series of Silent Night.

The overall goal of this DVD is to learn the song and have fun
doing it.  It may take you a day, week, or month but do it stress free.
Scott will tell you that your are not playing for perfection but
enjoyment.  Make it your tune, your style, your enjoyment and above all
stress free. Through out the lessons Scott will present what he calls
""nuggets"" (tips and tricks) that will make your playing easier or
the tune sounding better.

8366531,3,B002DZG892,"This is just my personal opinion.  If you don't already know how to play chords and have them memorized, this was too much information too fast for me.  I also tried another one of the ""Piano Guy's"" CDs.  I find that he talks too much while instructing.  If you are playing something and having a difficult time and he's talking the whole time, I can't concentrate.  Those of you that are used to chords, etc., would probably enjoy this 1-on-1.  It was too advanced for me, but I did not buy the whole set, that may be the problem.  Again, maybe it's because I'm new to chord playing, I just couldn't pick it up, but he spends plenty of time on the song Amazing Grace, but again, to me too much talking. It's like here's how to play this chord, or you can play it this way, or you can play it this other way.  Since I don't know chords, I'd like to learn just one, before I try learning all the other ways to do that one chord.  Again, it's just me.  I'm starting over with piano and maybe this was just too much for me.  Back when I was young, we learned to play left hand notes as well.  I did purchase this from Amazon, but no problem with Amazon.",1323561600,,1150,4.13063063063063
8366532,5,B002DZG892,I absoluty love this video. I can go as fast or as slow as I need. Everything is explained in plain words and the overhead view is excellent. Amazing Grace is one of my favorite songs and I will gladly purchase more of the one on one video's to learn new songs.,1320624000,,261,4.038461538461538
8366533,5,B002DZG892,"I loved this course and have since bought another. I'm a self-taught pianist (but a formally-taught classical guitarist). I had felt my playing had plateaued - and wanted some instruction that would yield quick improvement. This did it. Best of all, while it clearly improved my playing of Misty substantially, it also gives me tools which transfer to the rest of my repertoire. This is a big plus to this series - it may cover a specific tune, but the lessons are very transferable.

For those of us playing non-classical piano - Scott Houston is a huge asset. His teaching style is absolutely wonderful. In fact, I believe this guy could teach anything! He is a great educator. Frankly, I felt like I had a teacher in the room with me during these lessons. And not just any teacher, a great teacher.

The lessons (12 in this case) are clear, concise, interesting, and even funny sometimes. There is a logical progression - you can quickly skim the early lessons if they are too rudimentary. But, sure enough, I even learned a few things in those early sections. Once you have completed the lessons, you can easily use this dvd as a quick refresher - coming back to sections where a bit more practice may be required.

Before purchasing, I debated whether $30 for lessons on one song would be worth it to me. For me at least, it turned out to be more than worth it.

This dvd includes lead sheets (pdf files) for you to print out, chord diagrams (pdf files), video instruction (the main part - 12 lessons), and play-along audio tracks for additional practice. These play-along audio tracks come both with and without piano, and will allow you some variety in practicing the tune. The video itself is great - clear, good sound, and most-importantly the keyboard shots absolutely show what is being played.

As kind of a bonus, the dvd is compatible with many player piano systems - which strikes me as a really slick feature (but I can't personally attest to that in this review, since my Yahama is not compatible).",1301097600,,2015,4.648876404494382
8366534,5,B002DZG892,"I'm really enjoying going through this lesson. Scott does a great job explaining his ideas. As I watch and learn, I've had several ""ah, HA!"" moments. Great fun, easy to understand, and with practice, I'm learning to play this song.",1276041600,,231,4.8
8366535,5,B002DZG892,"I love the Piano Gay, Scott Houston!  This music teaches some new cords that I hadn't played before as well as instruction on how to make it sound better.  He is so good and a good way to learn is to watch someone else, especially someone that is so talented.  I have a couple of his other books also.  They are great songs and so enjoyable to play.  This is a good way to learn how to play a specific song well.",1269993600,,412,3.975609756097561
