1409530,5,B000059TGI,"Out of all these episodes ""Thor's Hammer"" was the most FX oriented of the bunch.  I thought the rest were pale in comparasion. When Stargate first premiered on Showtime all those years ago I never thought it would be as good as this. I read somewhere that Richard Dean Anderson was also considered for the lead in Deep Space Nine.  He also would have made a great Captain of the station. He's the opposite of McGuyver here. He doesn't have a James Bond set of tools to solve problems. His supporting cast is very good. Especially the ""Worf Figure"" as I call him...the actor with the symbol on his head(Christopher Judge).  He has a very baritone voice like Michael Dorn from Next Generation and DS9.",1003968000,,699,4.576
1409531,4,B000059TGI,"Hi all,
Stargate dvd's are now available in the uk all the way upto series 4! Just thought you all might like to know this.",1003363200,,123,3.96
1409532,5,B000059TGI,"Although I highly recommend any purchase of Stargate SG-1 episodes on DVD - and this release includes one of my favorites: The Nox (it also includes on of my least favorite : Brief Candle), I would strongly recommend opting for the season 1 boxed set instead.  Currently on Disc 1 and 2 are available seperately, but the boxed set spans the entirety of the first season.  Also, the video quality suffers some on this release because 5 episodes are included, but the degradation does not make it any less worthwhile to own.  The complete listing of episodes are:  4) The Broca Divide 5) The First Commandment 6) Cold Lazarus 7) The Nox 8) Brief Candle.
Highly Recommended - But STRONGLY recommend the Boxed set instead.",1001289600,,718,4.72
1409533,5,B000059TGI,"This DVD does not include the episoide THE NOX, the chronological order of the DVD is based on the Syndication release, not on Showtime. Therefore, THE NOX is in Volume 3, which is in the Season One boxed set.",996969600,2,209,4.384615384615385
1409534,4,B000059TGI,"As a fan of the series it is great to have these episodes out on DVD. My one complaint is that only Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 are available individually. If you want Volumes 3-5 to complete the first season episodes, you need to purchase the entire Season One Boxed Set (I have the same problem with the ""X-Files"" and a couple other shows). Looking forward to Season Two whenever that comes out on DVD.",996796800,2,392,4.24
1409535,5,B000059TGI,"I bought this understanding there to be 6 episodes (4 thru 9). I received it yesterday, only to find 5 episodes on it.
Even so, its still worth buying if you're a fan.",991094400,3,167,4.090909090909091
1409536,5,B000059TGI,"StarGate SG-1 is the best, the only problem I have is that several other reviews show that the episode The NOX is on the disc, but the disc I revieved only has episodes 4-8 on it. So if you purchase this title, take a close look at it and check to see what is on it, if some have the extra episode and some do not, you might be getting a bonus!!!",991008000,3,346,3.8194444444444446
1409537,5,B000059TGI,"Stargate SG1 is a great Science Fiction Adventure series featuring a great cast led by Richard Dean Anderson.  Michael Shanks is actually better in the role of Daniel Jackson than James Spader was in the original movie.  The special effects in the series are all top notch, and the scripts are well written.  Stargate SG1 is closer in spirit to the original Star Trek series of the 60's than any of the recent Star Trek shows (that's not comparing quality, just style - although SG1 holds up very well to them quality wise).  That sense of adventure from the original Star Trek series is present in SG1, but SG1 just has more modern sensibilities.  The episodes on the DVD Vol 2 are all good, with Brief Candle and Thor's Hammer as standouts.  This DVD is well worth buying, and I highly recommend it, but you may also want to consider the Box Set of season 1.  That's a great package.  But you get great value with Vol 2 on its own as well (5 episodes on this disc).  Either way - BUY IT!  You will not regret it.",990662400,5,1014,4.345744680851064
1409538,5,B000059TGI,"Finally, Mgm has lstened to our prays, Stargate SG-1 dvds available. This one in particular, has the classic The Nox and Thor's Hammer, two episodes that make this dvd worht of your money, however there are 6 episodes in only this dvd. Sound is grate, and the visual effects ar ok. The Stargte story has been realy well adapted to te small screen, so if you liked the movie, you'll defenitly love this one. If you haven't seen the Stargate series, this is your chance to become one. Althogh the other episoides are not that grate (but still excellent for a first season tv series),  The Nox and Thor's Hammer will keep you breathless.",982281600,,634,4.56140350877193

7934233,4,B000059TGI,"I think it is useful to remember that when you are looking at the first season of any series that the writing staff spends a lot of time getting everything set up in the pilot and then off of the various premises they have established they start spinning off stories.  This means that everybody is writing episodes without having seen any, which explains why it takes a show a while to get going after a strong pilot.  You will see that this is the case in the five episodes from Season 1 of ""Stargate SG-1"" that are collected here on Volume 2.  The results are certainly not bad as they explore some ideas basic to the premise of the series, but this series really hits stride in the second half of this first season and finishes very strongly.  The biggest common denominator for this set is that most of the episodes showcase the acting ability of Richard Dean Anderson, who gets to do a lot more than crack jokes in a sardonic manner.  So just keep in mind that the pilot was good, that the best is yet to come, and that these are still enjoyable episodes and one of them is very good:
Episode 4, ""Broco Divide"" (Written by Jonathan Glassner, Aired August 15, 1997) has SG-1 visiting a planet when the people are divided into the ""Touched"" and the ""Untouched.""  When the team returns home they discover that they have contracted the disease of the ""Touched,"" which has General Hammond (Don S. Davis) and Doctor Frasier (Teryl Rothery) in a state of near panic.  Although the problem of contagion is rarely as ""real"" consideration in these shows, this episode does deal with the problem and gives Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) an opporunity to get primitive.  4 Stargates.
Episode 5, ""The First Commandment"" (Written by Robert C. Cooper, Aired August 22, 19977) has SG-1 going off on a rescue mission for a pair of members from SG-9.  The planet has sunlight that is practically lethal and has caused Captain Jonas Hanson (William Russ) to go insane.  Hanson has declared himself a god and is working the natives to death in a quest for something he insists will save them all.  This is one of those episodes where the idea is something that ""Stargate SG-1"" wants to get around to, but the fifth episode is a bit early to play this card.  3 Stargates.
Episode 6, ""Brief Candle"" (Story by Steven Barnes, Teleplay by Katharyn Powers, Aired September 19, 1997) is one of those episodes when our heroes show up in a paradise and discover the place is more of a hell.  On this planet people live at an accelerated rate and live their lives in terms of days and not years.  O'Neill becomes afflicted by the nanocytic virus that afflicts the local populace and begins to age rapidly.  The question of why some aliens would think this was an ideal way for people to live becomes secondary to Anderson's performance.  4 Stargates.
Episode 7, ""Cold Lazarus"" (Written by Jeffery F. King, Aired August 29, 1977) is the best episode on this set.  After O'Neill is injured touchign a blue crystal on a mission an alien comes through the Stargate impesonating the Colonel and goes to see his ex-wife (Harley Jane Kozak).  This is one of those episodes where you wonder what is going on and the payoff to the mystery is worth the wait.  5 Stargates.
Episode 8, ""Thor's Hammer"" (Written by Katharyn Powers, Aired September 26, 1997) takes SG-1 to the planet Cimmeria (where Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian hailed) where they encoutner a Viking-like culutre that worships Thor, god of thunder, and his big hammer.  Meanwhile they meet a woman who once had a Goa'uld but it now free of the parasite, which might have some significance for Teal'c (Christopher Judge), who has an encounter with Unas, the first Goa'uld.  This is an episode where the stuff about the Goa'uld is interesting but the Viking stuff is rather unnecessary.  But, again, remember this is the first season and the idea that the people on the planets you can reach through the Stargate originally came from Earth thousands of years ago has all the writers picking their favorite ancient cultures.  4 Stargates.
You will notice that the airdates are out of order.  I have no explanation for why this does not jive with the episode numbers presented here, but I will offer the observation that the obvious result is to put three solid acting performances by Richard Dean Anderson on this one DVD.  Of course, this makes it seem like the whole point of ""Stargate SG-1"" is to see what they new makeup job they can make their star endure each week, but I can assure you that is not the dominant theme of the first season.  I would rate this disc 4.5 stars if they would let me.",1058572800,3,4641,4.608748481166464
7934234,4,B000059TGI,"I won't go into a rehash of the series plot, but this disc sets up some of the later storylines. If you are a fan of the series, you need this disc. If you are just getting into the series, you need this disc.
The video quality is good, everthing looked sharp and clean when I was watching it. Likewise audio is good, but is you have a good setup you might be disappointed in only having a Dolby 2.0 audio track.
What disc fails at is in the extra's department. Having only a featurette on the disc just isn't enough anymore. Maybe a episode with a commentary track would be good, or a who's who of the universe. Something other than a long commerical for the series. One other thing that bothers me is the lack of subtitles. The only way to have them is to turn on closed captioning which is kind of annoying.

I tell you the Stargate series is outstanding",1028332800,,145,4.407407407407407

7934239,4,B000059TGI,"Not being familiar with the series, and not a particularly big fan of the original motion picture, my main reason for buying Episodes 4-8 of Stargate was the price. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised by what I was greeted by. Competent dialogue, well casted (hey, is that MacGyver?) and some nice special effects make for a series that's actually better than the movie, IMHO. The DVD transfer is OK, not great, but not terrible either. The sound is decent too, though again, nothing particularly noteworthy. Basically, it's a great show on a so-so DVD. At this price, it's an easy decision. Buy it...",1009756800,,609,4.809523809523809
7934240,5,B000059TGI,"This is by far one of the best TV series I have ever seen. I have watched it for seven years now since it first began on Showtime. I shouldn't have to tell you the cast is great. Richard Dean Anderson made a smart move producing and acting in this series. I was happy to hear that another season is in the making for the SciFi channel. As many have said you are better off buying the entire season if you can afford it since they are all great and the price is incredibly low for all the hours of entertainment. You will not find better acting, sets, music, and special effects for this low of a price. I would have paid twice as much gladly for this wonderful set. It is more like watching a movie than a series with such great production values. If you haven't seen this series catch it on TV or rent a DVD if you can. I am sure after you see it you will want to buy the whole season. I am anxiously waiting for the rest the seasons to come out. I want to buy them all on DVD!",1005004800,,978,3.969543147208122
