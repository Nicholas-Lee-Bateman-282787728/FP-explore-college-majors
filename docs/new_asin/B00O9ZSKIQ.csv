Starting with being a demolition crew, was amazing, since they protected the military ships from underwater bombs, and military barges landing on the beach were protected from enemy traps set up on the beach.  The SEALS did some much to protect the American troops when they landed on the beach during the invasion of Normande, the largest military invasion in history.  An incredible group of men, who are specialized in military combat on land, sea, and air.  What great courage these men have.

It was quite nostalgic for me to be reminded of the ""frogmen"" who were the roots of the Navy Seals. I had not heard a reference to the frogmen since I was a kid.

These unsung heroes and their counterparts throughout our armed forces have played a major part of our military history. Their time in the current limelight, I hope, will be short lived.

If you are expecting a vivid retelling of many of the SEALs past assignments... this isn't the movie for you.

I have even more respect for our armed forces and the sacrifices they make to protect our country.

I learned so much about the entire institution of the Navy Seals.
The stories told by the individuals are told with dignity without the bravado.
Every single actor who has ever portrayed a Navy Seal or has plans to, needs to watch this documentary.  The actors earn so much more money to pretend to portray them, yet these fine men exemplify the meaning of the word hero.  A word that one can never portray.
Gary Sinese does an excellent job of narrating without interference of the conveyed message.",1433548800,2,598,4.622641509433962

These men of courage and honor deserve our greatest support.

I recently had the opportunity to be in the Fort Pierce (Florida) area and went to the Navy UDT SEALs Museum. The experience was humbling and the display there was simply awesome. The Maersk Alabama's lifeboat was on display and so were other items from other missions. Terrific to have watched this show and then be at the museum.

6730984,2,B00O9ZSKIQ,"This wasn't necessarily bad, I just found it boring in its presentation.  Also, many of the details presented I have encountered in other documentaries on the subject.

The problem with some of these war documentaries/infotainment, for me at least, is that they seem a little bit too much like propaganda.  I'm not sure if the subject material just causes it to appear that way, if the military funded this, or if it is the only way to get participation from the military in making these.

Whatever the case, if you don't mind having the stories presented to you in such a way as to always present the Navy Seals as the good guys, this isn't a bad film to watch.  But if you have been a fan of military documentaries over the past 15 years or so you may not get anything new from it.",1431993600,,783,4.372413793103449

6731003,5,B00O9ZSKIQ,"CAPTIVATING DOCUMENTARY

This documentary on the history of the US Navy SEALs is absolutely captivating. It goes back further than the actual Trident wearing SEALs of the modern era, back to their predecessors in World War II, showing the groundwork that was laid to create the modern day SEALs.

I was riveted for this entire 2 hour show. It presents the facts of the history in a way that makes it very easy to understand the military need and global political climate and how those two things worked together to create a use for SEAL teams. And its all very easy to follow and understand.

I found this on Amazon instant video and gave it a try....and am I glad I did. What an amazing documentary. I learned so much about the history of Navy Frogmen, and was highly entertained by the education the entire time.

As a Marine I have worked with SEALs in training ops and the level of dedication these guys bring to the table is surreal. It's awesome to see the history of the teams back to their inception, which is largely overlooked in all the modern day coverage of what SEALs are doing right now.

Any military history fan would love this.

6731278,1,B00O9ZSKIQ,Completely disregards the contributions of Richard Marcinko the First commander of Seal Team 6. I feel that leaving out this critical personality from even being mentioned creates a false narrative. From leading some of the most successful operations in Vietnam to founding Seal Team 6 and pioneering counter terrorism tactics Mr. Marcinko was vital to the history and evolution of the Navy Seals.,1430438400,5,397,5.317460317460317

The film features lots of pyrotechnics, and firefights galore as it shows SEALS in a variety of combat missions including high altitude and undersea insertion. A  great movie  for military action junkies. It definitely provides a boost of adrenaline to all couch potatoes and action junkies, not to mention any of those who have either served in the military....",1427328000,16,452,5.094594594594595

6731290,5,B00O9ZSKIQ,"This is not a profession that anyone just gets into it just for the heck of it since it requires certain qualifications. The first and foremost, one needs to be genetically fit to tolerate all the mental as well as physical pressures since there is so much diet and activity can do when it comes to being fit. Secondly, it requires determination. I am into health, nutrition and many sports and there is not a single session of any type of work out that I go through that I can feel satisfied unless I am alert and I know that I have to push and push regardless if it is mountain biking, hiking, surfing, pumping iron or whatever since not only human body is designed to be lazy but more importantly as we age, our capabilities become limited so determination is the biggest motivation of all except that there are so many rewarding moments of satisfaction where it comes with those kind of activities.

With all that said, it is not difficult to understand that the only reason why anyone would want to be a Navy Seals --that is only if one qualifies-- would be nothing other than being the best of best when it comes to many tasks requiring many human capabilities which comes with personal rewards and satisfactions not for fame, otherwise Olympics would be a better option. For those reasons it was very confusing to me watching few top Navy Seals going public on CBS 60 Minutes, disguising themselves and talking about their accomplishments when I assumed that just being able to be in that group and accomplishing those tasks when trusted would have been the biggest gift of all for personal reasons.

This is not a documentary about the Seals only, it is more, much more. It covers two hours of America's history. There is so much to learn that they should show this documentary in every school so Americans can understand what war means and what it takes to be on top of the game when it comes in winning a war, any type of war, anywhere. Seals are true Americans who put everything they have got on line while most citizens have no idea of what givings means unless they know of them. Watching the fallen commander Mansoor was very painful, extremely painful. Great documentary. Bravo.",1422576000,,2194,4.594387755102041
