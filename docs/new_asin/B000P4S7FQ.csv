8188868,5,B000P4S7FQ,"Anyone who loves animation and cartoons is always wondering what the other studios were up to, since it's so difficult to see any of their work. Van Beuren, apparently, in the early-mid '30s, was up to making these Little King cartoons, based on Otto Soglow's pantomime strip in the  New Yorker. Obviously, you can't find good prints of old cartoons just laying around, and Thunderbean gathered these twelve cartoons from France, the UK, and all points west, often reconstructing a cartoon from pieces of various prints. I've wanted to see these cartoons for a long time, but what attracted me to this set was the special features, with on-screen commentary by Chris Buchman, Milton Knight, and Steve Stanchfield. One thing I learned there was that animator Jim Tyer, known for this series and later Terrytoons (the latter still not on DVD), also did Stuffy Derma for the Milton the Monster Show. Stuffy is a hobo who strikes it rich but longs for the simple joys of his old life. This supporting cartoon rotated in the Milton series. There were only four Stuffy cartoons in the entire Milton series, which was released in a four disc set by Shout Factory&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Milton-The-Monster-Show-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000M8N41M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Milton The Monster Show - The Complete Series</a>. It's a surprisingly ambitious and poignant cartoon, with each episode as a mini-story, but then the Hal Seeger show, which ran on ABC in 1965-'66, was in every way a top-notch cartoon series, with funny writing, good character design, and comic book slapstick.

The Little King's popularity spread from the New Yorker in the '30s to the wider kingdom of the funny papers, where he appeared until Soglow's death in 1975. At last a Little King book is forthcoming,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Monarch-Otto-Soglow-and-the-Little-King/dp/1613771487/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Monarch: Otto Soglow and the Little King</a>, and comics fans can once again revel in his unique, minimal, modern style of line drawing. This style is only kept in two of the cartoons in this collection, which feature Soglow's character, Sentinel Louie. The last cartoon is a later Fleischer Betty Boop cartoon featuring the Little King. This is the second Thunderbean collection I have to rave about, the first being Cartoon Commercials&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Commercials/dp/B000ZJX16Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Commercials!</a>, which compares very favorably to other commercials collections by much better known companies. I would prefer that the Thunderbean DVDs return you to the menu after you watch the selected cartoon (or commercial) which they don't. They keep playing the rest of the cartoons. But that is a minor cavil, as one can simply select menu again or eject the disc.

As with other studios, Van Beuren's cartoons were made to be shown with a major black and white film and a newsreel in a theater setting. They did their best to be fast and funny, and to play off of the live-action movies of the day. Stereotypes are not an accident. They are deliberate distortions to make characters more cartoony, but they are meant to be distortions of the subjects of live-action films, not real life. The big example of this, of course, is the Warner Bros cartoons featuring caricatures of Humphrey Bogart and other Warner stars, meant to echo and parody the accompanying live films. Which is to say that while we might not agree with everything in some of these cartoons, we are glad that Thunderbean nevertheless has preserved this little-seen bit of animation history.",1329609600,4,3760,5.639575971731449
8188869,5,B000P4S7FQ,"Great old depression era cartoons from a time when anything goes and people didn't have their heads up their you know what like they do now!  They had more important issues to deal with, like staying alive, & these cartoons were short but wonderful little escapes.  The ""Little King"" turns everyday life situations into hilarious mayhem & always comes out on top & always with loads of political incorrectness thrown in for good measure.  So get over it, sit back, enjoy!",1320192000,5,471,4.790123456790123
8188870,5,B000P4S7FQ,"The Little King Cartoons Are Great Fun.  I wish the cartoons of today were as creative as the ones from the 1930's up to the 1970's.  We live in a time where every thing has to be politically correct.  It's best that I don't say anymore, other than I love these cartoons, I have been wanting to see these for years.  THANK YOU.

8188871,5,B000P4S7FQ,"The Van Beuren cartoon studio was not the best in the early 1930s. Their animators ranged from competent to laughably bad (which I find is part of their charm); they were not comfortable with talking pictures. Otto Soglow's Little King character made for a pretty good fit with Van Beuren: he didn't speak, and Soglow's simple, elegant visual style did not tax Van Beuren's people overmuch. These cartoons are not timeless classics, but they're fun and very well presented by Thunderbean. Highly recommended.",1296691200,,508,5.132530120481928
8188872,5,B000P4S7FQ,"Another home run for Thunderbean animation. This ""little company that could"" has a lesson some of the bigger companies should learn. This is how a package of vintage cartoons should be assembled!

The cartoons have been selected based on the best available prints (some of the titles here are actually composites from several different prints) to recreate the entire catalog of Van Beuren Sentinel Louey/Little King cartoons - with a bonus Fleischer Betty Boop thrown in for good measure.

Long neglected and virtually forgotten, ""The Little King"" can stand with the best black and white cartoons of the 1930's. The surrealistic gags and jazz soundtracks bring to mind the work of the Fleischer Brothers Studio.

This title has joined the other DVDs I've ordered from Thunderbean (""Attack of the 1930's Characters,"" ""Cubby the Bear,"" and ""Aesop's Fables""). A ""must have"" for fans of vintage cartoons!",1184371200,8,900,5.1931034482758625
8188873,5,B000P4S7FQ,"A complete collection of the Van Beuren Studios' ""Little King"" cartoons has long been on my video ""want"" list.  Well, Thunderbean has delivered the goods IN SPADES!  Not only do we have all of the Van Beuren L.K. titles, but we have two ""Sentinel Louie"" precursor cartoons plus the Fleischer Studios' one and only L.K. appearance with Betty Boop.

Thunderbean has assembled this collection by searching out the best-looking and best-sounding prints from a world-wide network of archives and collectors.  It's AMAZING that a collection assembled with this level of care and effort could be had at such a reasonable price!

If you love vintage cartoon rarities, do not fail to seek out this collection.",1176249600,9,700,5.052173913043478
8188874,5,B000P4S7FQ,"Once again, Thunderbean has given us a DVD worth watching over and over again.  This time, we get every animated short feauring Otto Soglow's The Little King.  With most of the animation coming from the vastly underrated Van Beuren Studios (and his final appearance with Betty Boop coming from the wonderful Fleischer Studios), his majesty has never looked better!  These cartoons have been cleaned up and given a shine that looks marvelous.  And the sound!  So clean.  So crisp.  Better than they've ever sounded.  Thunderbean has outdone themselves this time around.

As for the shorts, they're a definate treat borderlining from slapstick to the downright bizarre.  These cartoons need to be seen to be believed.  They're a time capsule from a different era featuring a character that should have been given more of an animated spotlight.  They're fun fun fun!

If you're an animation collector, this release belongs in your collection.  Avoid the cheapy, VHS-transfered releases and get this one!

You're in for a treat!",1175817600,17,1024,5.121212121212121
8188875,5,B000P4S7FQ,"Thunderbean and Steve Stanchfield have made available all 12 of The Little King 1930's cartoons from the Van Beuren studio. (Plus, included is a Max Fleischer cartoon appearance.) They look great and they are fun to watch. Plus, he always gives us extras to enjoy on the Thunderbean DVDs. I have always enjoyed Steve's constant quality for the cartoon fan. This will be a DVD that one will be happy to have in their collection. Don't miss out on this one!",1175731200,7,455,4.62962962962963
