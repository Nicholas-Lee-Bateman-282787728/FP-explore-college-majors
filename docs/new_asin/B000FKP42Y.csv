He's got a style thats sorely lacking in anime - he can do the pervy anime thing whilst not being ""fanservice"" perse - used more as a comedic device. Love Souske and the Orange (Headmaster) dude. Oh and the whole premise of the series ISNT ""ninja girl in training steals panties"" - really that plot summary does a disservice to the series - thats only about the first episode, after that its alot of hilarious antics (on running gags) and episodic in nature. Would've liked a sequel to this. Very funny, unique animation - nothing quite like it around - highly recommended. I hope more comedy anime like this make it to the west. Animation is rather unique aswell, nothing jarring or earth shattering but definetly different. Read up on the real series - not the truncated plot summary of the first episode lol.",1414368000,2,968,4.633720930232558

8124388,5,B000FKP42Y,"Do you like Excel Saga? If so then check out this title!

Ninja nonsense centers around a ninja in training ""Shinobu"" and her exploits as she trains. Can we say shiny penny syndrome? Shinobu meets Kairi a strait laced studious girl. Shinobu immediatly becomes infatuated with Kairi and they become good friends (its implied with benefits) Definitly a great one for a wacky anime night.",1263427200,,385,4.923076923076923
8124389,5,B000FKP42Y,"This show is a very zany comedy chock full of lewd jokes and comments, weird visual gags, and perverse moments throughout. Ninja Nonsense, originally called NinxNin=Shinobuden (but changed to Ninja Nonsense because of the Japanese reference) is about Shinobu, a ninja trainee who has to collect underwear from high school girls. Then she finds Kaede Shiranui, a normal teenager who then becomes Shinobu's best friend. Shinobu also has a teacher named Onsakamaru who makes pervy comments like ""Now it's my turn. I'm gonna show you a picture of someone [explitive] in reverse! See? Look at it now. See how it's sucking back in?"" The 15+ rating is well deserved, because this show has a weird obsession with the crude, but not that much nudity (well, covered up that is). I think that teens two years younger (13) can handle the crude humor/fanservice/language. Overall this show makes you laugh. Seriously.",1183075200,2,904,5.073825503355705
8124390,5,B000FKP42Y,"This is probably the best comedy show ever made.  I know there're lots of good anime shows but you can call this one unique, why? well:

1 - Both of the English and Japanese versions are top-notch.
2 - Vivid colors and  fluent animation.
3 - Character design are just beautiful.
4 - Fan service.
5 - it is a BLACK COMEDY.
6 - Shinobu's sweet cherry.

If you're new or old in this large world of anime, then this series IS the best option to be updated.",1160870400,6,452,4.1022727272727275
8124391,4,B000FKP42Y,"This is the story of Shinobu, a ninja trainee. Shinobu is a totally naive girl, supposedly learning the ninja arts from her headmaster, Onsokomaru. Onsokomaru is a letcherous round yellow ball, who seems to have no redeeming qualities. We also meet Kaede (a normal schoolgirl), who becomes Shinobu's best friend.

This disk includes six half-episodes (or 3 full episodes, depending on how you count it). The episodes are standalone for the most part (at least on the first disk), so its easy to watch a half-episode for a short bit, and come back to the disk later.

The humor in this series is the primary thing that sets it apart. It is somewhat reminiscent of Excel Saga. Ranging from lewd comments (usually from Onsokomaru) and slapstick gags (usually at Onsokomaru's expense) to strange circumstances that Shinobu gets herself into, the gags are pretty funny if you're into it. If you are looking for a serious series, look elsewhere. This disk is also not for the younger viewers - some of the innuendo and lewd humor would be too mature for them

Art-wise, the female characters are drawn in a cute (kawai) style, with larger, rounded heads. In the first disk, there are few (if any) normal male characters - just Onsokomaru and a bunch of identical ninjas (who are all named Sasuke). The cuteness is not overdone though, and it makes perfect sense for such a naive character.

Other nice touches - the stop-motion ending credits are a riot. The music is fairly good too, and the dubbing works well.

Finally, the accompanying booklet (included in the DVD) provides translation notes, including explanations for the jokes which don't translate well into Western culture. This is the type of thing which I'd like to see more frequently - kudos to RightStuf for including this!

Overall, Ninja Nonsense a fun series that doesn't take itself (or much else) too seriously. Its definitely the thing after a stressful day.",1157328000,12,1923,4.883435582822086
