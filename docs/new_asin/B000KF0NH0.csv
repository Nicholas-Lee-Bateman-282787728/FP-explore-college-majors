2689750,4,B000KF0NH0,"I am impressed with this one. It's low budget but has a decent sci-fi story. The acting is B movie quality but not awful. It has a few famous faces in it. Overall, I enjoyed it. I especially like the realistic rending despite the premise being kinda out there. It has an older sci-fi movie feel to it. Nothing too high budget in the special effects and a decent story. I would recommend this one to those who like to check out the fringe sci-fi stuff.",1496361600,4,451,4.255813953488372
2689751,5,B000KF0NH0,"Not a fast paced movie, but it constantly rolls forward and accelerates as time goes by.
If you are looking for action and special effects you won't get those here.

This is a refreshing UFO themed story of unlikely heroes who do what it takes to save the day.
Why do we need a ""Superman"" or other ""Super Hero when it is really every day people who often make the most difference in our lives?
Believable acting, a good clean script and a decent plot make for a pensive and enjoyable movie.

Lots of funny lines, but my favorite quote from this movie is: ""Dewey Decimal System""  - hahahahaha",1496102400,8,591,4.4036697247706424
2689752,5,B000KF0NH0,"If you like indie, sci-fi, ufo movies, this flick is definitely a good watch.  I  really enjoyed the spoofing of other similar genre movies.",1494115200,,140,4.791666666666667
2689753,1,B000KF0NH0,"I took a chance on the 2 ratings reviews, watched the  movie, and unfortunately, I cannot  begin to understand how this movie was given a 5 star rating.  It barely deserves one star.  It must have been made on a hundred dollar budget.  The acting is terrible.  And, the directing is even worse.  Potentially, the plot could have been a springboard for decent sci-fi movie.  Unless of course, this movie was made as a complete spoof of sci-fi alien movies. That is the only rational conclusion one could arrive at, given the pure waste of time and energy to sit through this movie.  I am not given to writing negative comments, however, to spare even one person from spending time watching this movie, whilst  hoping for the movie to improve as time drags on.... it never happened.  I can only conclude that the 2 comments prior must have been made by those associated with the making of this very, very low budget film.  Watch it if you must, however I  cannot even remotely recommend this movie unless of course,you also enjoy watching paint dry.",1491696000,8,1047,4.625
2689754,5,B000KF0NH0,"This is a funny, well scripted and well directed little indie film. Katie plays a bored, but loved and loving housewife who simply has no goal in life beyond the everyday world of caring for her family. ALL THAT CHANGES and that's all I'm going to say. Buy it and watch it yourself. This is a great and wonderful little film. I have seen so many great indie films out there in the realm of sci fi/weird films (like BANSHEE CHAPTER and ABSENTIA) that I believe they are putting Hollywood to shame. Buy this!",1404518400,4,506,4.3936170212765955
2689755,5,B000KF0NH0,"From Other Worlds is a satire of UFO movies and UFO sightings, in general.  To take it as a serious action adventure movie, is to miss the whole point of the whole story.  To that end, of spoofing Alien movies, it contains nearly every cliche that finds it way into this type of movie.  I especially liked the UFO support group.  Would I recommend it?  I have it.  I watch it on a regular basis (say three times a year, maybe four). I am also planning to give another copy as a gift.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Other-Worlds/dp/B000KF0NH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Other Worlds</a>",1195776000,5,639,5.469387755102041

2689769,4,B000KF0NH0,"As a fan of independent sci fi, I really enjoyed this. It's fun, interesting, and novel. Joel de la Fuente is hilarious (there could have been more of him...), Cara Buono is believable and likeable, and Isaach De Bankol really shines - I want to see more of all three of these actors. Highly recommended for folks who, like me, like their science fiction films with a side of human relationships and humor.",1520208000,,406,4.575342465753424
2689770,4,B000KF0NH0,Well written with believable and likable characters. Clearly low budget with no action but the writing and the subject matter should be enough to hold just about anyone's attention unless they are into hardcore science fiction.,1519948800,,227,5.333333333333333
2689771,2,B000KF0NH0,"Sorry...  I can't go higher than a 2/5 on this one...  in general, the acting wasn't 1/2 bad, but there just didn't seem to be much chemistry and pretty much all the jokes fell flat for me...  couple that with no special effects and a meandering plot, and there you go...  2 stars.

I could see ""some"" people getting a ""little"" bit more of a kick out of this, but gimme a break with the 5 star reviews...  those people must be off their rockers...",1519516800,2,447,4.2

2689774,4,B000KF0NH0,Just watched it was different from most UFOs. The young wife was very depressed with her mundane life till she received a mark on her side that looked like something from Greece two thousand years ago. This was pushing her over the edge. I was good with it till it got into UFOs but didn't stop watching. I say give it a try.,1496793600,,325,4.174603174603175
2689775,5,B000KF0NH0,"I agree with the others on it keeping a good flow going. It does seem like an old movie and I expected that sort of feel to it.  Had some funny lines as well as good goofy stuff.  I found it relaxing to watch since it didn't have all the extra 'action' seen in space movies - fighting, shooting and people killing or dying.",1496707200,2,323,4.03125

8156257,2,B000KF0NH0,"The cover makes this movie seems great, but it's just a tv movie.  For some strange reason, the four letter word sh** comes up a lot in this movie.  Thus, not a movie for kids, but too boring for adults.  A woman is abducted by aliens in Brooklyn, New York, but her family and  the doctors do not believe her story, so she turns to a therapy group (similar to AA meetings) for alien sightings.  There, she meets a guy from the Ivory Coast, an African country, who also has an interest as to why he was abducted.  Soon the two get word from the alien being that they must exchange an ancient scroll that is at the Brooklyn Museum for a scroll that the alien is giving them.  The reason is the ancient scroll has the wrong formula that can take humans into the dark ages vs. the new scroll would correct the problem because it contains the correct formula for humans to start a new period of development.  This movie feels super low budget with a weak story and not so good acting.  The director didn't know which audience he was aiming for, so it won't attract most people.",1522454400,,1072,4.293532338308458

8156259,4,B000KF0NH0,"Nice little movie that is upbeat and easy to watch.  It isn't a ""great"" movie but it is a ""sweet"" movie.  With so many cynical apocalyptic movies and TV series it is nice to watch something that has the feel of a movie made in the 1980s.  it won't suck the life out of you like so many movies do today.",1522022400,,302,3.918032786885246
8156260,3,B000KF0NH0,"The actors are likable enough but were tasked to suffer a terrible script upon the viewers. Most of the 'joke' sketches are poorly conceived, several quite pointless.
