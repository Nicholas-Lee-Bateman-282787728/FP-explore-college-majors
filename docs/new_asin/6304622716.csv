Of course might be of interest if you like to train yourself in lip-reading...or play charade-type games of guessing what the actors are saying...Might be useful for preparation for IQ-tests solving (guessing), or writing your own dialogues if you consider a career of a playwright...",1516406400,,393,5.459016393442623

7875408,5,6304622716,"This is one of few best movies ever made in the world. In the versions available in America Anthony Quinn is presented as the lead actor. Adriano Celentano's name is not even mentioned on the cover of the box, though it is him in the picture. Celentano is as popular in Italy as Elvis was in US. This movie presents the best, really intelligent humor and the two great actors compliment each other. Funny, in Wikipedia, this movie is not even on the list of Quinn's works, like it never existed. It is an anfortunate fact that in America we tend to only know American. One of the reviewers here mentioned that this movie was made after American movie ""The Sting"". Yes, there are some similarity in the idea of how these guys created the bluff (by the way, in Europe the movie is called ""Bluff"" not ""The Con Artists"") but those two movies have really nothing in common. The Bluff is a funny, romantic, musical and humoristic comedy where you enjoy the work of two greatest actors. The plot and what happens is not really important. It is watching the faces of these guys expressing sarcasm, irony, jokes that makes it all a joy. Who cares if they get the money or not. The Sting does not posess these qualities. Once you understand what those guys try to pull off, about 20% into the movie, it becomes boring as you know very well, they will succeed. And then it becomes a mediocre action movie. But The Bluff (The Con Artists) may not be for every one. If you are looking for action, not much there. But if you are looking for top quality humor expressed by actors in tiny motions of their faces and eyes more hinting on it than actually saying it, then this movie is for you. And then who cares about quality. I have the tape and I am watching it once in a while. For me it is good enough. By the way, the tape sais 86 minutes. No cheating.",1368230400,7,1841,4.339130434782609
7875409,2,6304622716,"A shameless Italian-made ripoff of The Sting, even down to the pseudo-ragtime music. As other reviewers have mentioned, the colors in the transfer to DVD are terrible. Really only for those who are perversely interested in watching the downward spiral of Anthony Quinn's post-1960s career.",1346371200,,289,5.444444444444445

7875411,5,6304622716,This is a great hilarous movie about 2 con artists how escape from jail. they both try to out smart one another but later on they join together to fool others. Anthony Quinn is the wiser con artist Adriano Celentano is like the student who learns fast. This is a very funny movie how the student out smarts the teacher.,972172800,17,319,4.333333333333333
