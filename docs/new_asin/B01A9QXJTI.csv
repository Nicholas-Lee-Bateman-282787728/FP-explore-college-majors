8746795,5,B01A9QXJTI,"I unfortunately didn't get a chance to see this movie when it first came out, but recently I bought a four pack of Nicholas Sparks movie adaptations and when I saw this I thought it was a great movie that for whatever reason did not get the attention it deserved. It was better than ""The Notebook"" and much more emotional. It starts out with an incident of irresponsible juveniles getting into trouble and injuring a fellow HS student in an initiation. During this sequence, my wife and I were having second thoughts about the movie but I am glad we stayed with it as it got better as it went along. The performance by Mandy Moore was terrific, Oscar caliber. Shane West as the HS bad boy was also very good. There were a lot of the usual high school cliches, because that's what happens in HS. This was a beautiful love story with it' s center a beautiful, talented, smart deeply religious Christian girl, Mandy Moore. It was more than just a love story in that her affect on the whole community around her was great and positive.  The scene at the high school play was terrific and memorable. The movie was intensely emotional and affects me that way each time I see it. I have read several reviews by ""critics"" saying the movie was just a high school love story and needed to be more raw. This was a beautiful love story but also an inspirational story and needed nothing raw to be believable. I have tried to avoid any plot revealing details, but trust me, you will be deeply moved by this movie each time you see it.",1465084800,,1521,4.412811387900356
8746796,5,B01A9QXJTI,"Some bad over-acting by some of the teen supporting cast, but the lead actors were great. The song ""Only Hope"" was inspiring. Get the tissues ready for the father-son reunion toward the end...it's a real tear-jerker.",1464048000,,216,5.027777777777778
