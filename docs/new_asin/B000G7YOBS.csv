I have to say the dancing is really the thing that caught my interest in this film. The choreographer really knew how to combine modern/western/jazz with traditional Indian moves and Urmila Matondkar is an excellent dancer.",1246752000,2,361,5.016666666666667
8129363,5,B000G7YOBS,"Rangeela means ""colourful"".When Rangeela came out in 1995,I was at 11 years of age. I went to the local theater to watch it expecting a love triangle. Sadly throughout the movie it seems Amir Khan's gonna be the loser. The last scene had me grinning like a kid who's just been allowed free rides at a nearby amusement park for a year.

Amir Khanna plays a role of a lifetime. This movie made me realise what the slight(with reference to his height) is capable of in terms of comedy luring into deeper grief. He loves Milli in the film and keeps waiting for the day when he can finally declare his love for her. Jackie Shroff plays what I would call a role only he could have played. He's disappeared into his own world nowadays but I love his approach to this role.

Amir Khan is stuck in a world of his own. I must say that Rangeela has one of the strongest musical compositions ever. A.R Rehman touches god like quality with bass that was unknown to Bollywood. One of My favourite songs from this film is the title track with good music but the one that is the best is ""Tanha Tanha"".

A definte buy no matter who you are. For those of you unfamiliar with Indian films ,this film is top gun. I still smile when I recall the last scene. I watched it in the theater twice because I was too young to go for a film by myself. My friends didn't like it because not many Indian people like films that have grief in it or that can make you cry. However , we were pre-teens so that can be ignored.

This film reigned my top films for a long time.

Some other good Amir Khan films are Dil,Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi,Lagaan
