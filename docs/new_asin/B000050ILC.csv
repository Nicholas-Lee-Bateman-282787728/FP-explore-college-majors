7929131,5,B000050ILC,I Was looking for this game and/or its footage for a long time. A little hard to play but very amusing. Great extra behind-the-scenes features.,1365033600,,143,4.76
7929132,3,B000050ILC,"Anyone who has played Dragon's Lair or Space Ace will already be accustomed to Time Traveler, the game that debuted as the first holographic game to hit arcades. The game play consists of random ""acts"", grouped together according to time periods, that the main character, Marshall Graham, must transverse in order to save the universe. The plot is really nonsensical, involving cowboys, ninjas and (!) baseball players. But anyone who enjoyed the arcade game will find in this a faithful reproduction, down to the pretty lady who is ohhh so happy to sell you her reversal cubes. Not for all tastes, but a must-own for Video Game Buffs.",994377600,2,635,4.888888888888889
