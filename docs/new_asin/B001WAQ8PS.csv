8347379,5,B001WAQ8PS,"This item was offered from the distributor with 1 UPC code on all DVD's even though there are about 30 different items. The movies are great, popular actors, fantastic art work and synopsis on each cover, and a great price. Unfortunately, because they are all the same UPC, you will have to send an e-mail to the seller for their current inventory on hand if you want a specific title filled with your order. It is worth the extra effort on your part to get this great deal. We are glad to respond quickly at www.amazon.com/shops/MOVIESYOUSEE to any questions you have on this or any of our 4000 DVD's in stock.",1238025600,,611,4.513513513513513

8347381,1,B001WAQ8PS,"How can anyone, especially Amazon expect to sell an unknown product?
Who would buy anything, not knowing a single thing about such a product?
Seems to me as if Amazon is promoting irresponsibility if they actually expect that people would purchase something without any details or information about the product they're pushing. The idea here is no more than selling a secretive ""Grab Bag.""",1237680000,,389,5.09375
