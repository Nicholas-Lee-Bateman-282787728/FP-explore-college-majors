8222299,4,B000WC8CMO,"Elizabeth (Lee) Miller (1907-1977) achieved fame in front of and behind the camera as a leading fashion model and muse to famous artists in the 20s and 30s, including Man Ray, and as a fashion and news photographer.  This brief documentary follows her life and career through photos, films she appeared in, and interviews with people who knew her, including photographer David Sherman and her son Tony -- who grew up to become a ... dairy farmer, despite having Lee and the British surrealist painter Ronald Penrose for parents!

Certainly worth watching for a rare glimpse at a woman who was both beautiful and talented -- though despite all her success she seems to have felt that no one really loved her.  It is not made clear why she felt that way or how exactly she wanted to be loved.  Perhaps insights along those lines are buried in the archive her son has assembled. I would recommend a quick look at the Wikipedia entry under her name, where the reader will learn some suprising facts left out of this documentary.",1267488000,2,1024,4.6722222222222225
8222300,3,B000WC8CMO,"I saw this via a certain red envelope service, on a whim.  I saw ""Lee"" in the title and assumed it would be about a male photographer.  Instead, it's about a female Lee.  She was multi-talented, working as a model, photojournalist, gallery owner, inter alia.  The work is not static:  it moves from the whimsical 20s to the sadness of World War II.  (Surprisingly, little is said about the dark days of the Depression Era.)  I don't know how important Ms. Miller was to history, but if you think of her in the light of Marilyn Monroe or Madonna, or many pretty women who accomplish much in their lives, then you'll find yourself interested.

The work only has three interviewees: Lee's son, his nanny, and Lee's friend/(lover?).  I wonder if this is a self-financed or promoted work.  Its lack of interviewees points to a low budget, but the photos and old newsreel clips may suggest something of a higher quality.  It was bizarre to see a man refer to his mother by her first name and not as ""Mom.""  However, he concludes by saying she wasn't much of an attentive mother.  Perhaps this could explain his indifference in seeing so many nude photos of Ms. Miller.

This is a European work that gives you several language options that you wouldn't find on most American DVDs.  Still, an unseen, French interviewer asks the questions and many of the native English speakers can't decipher what he's saying.  My guess is that most of us Americans won't understand him either.  Surely they could have gotten a native English speaker to ask the questions and then they could have dubbed and had subtitles to their hearts' content.

Wearing a feminist cap may make you have trouble with the work.  The work starts with a lot of Ms. Miller's private parts.  On the one hand, folk in their 20s may be the best candidates for posing nude.  However, it may be a raunchy ploy to bring in viewers by showing ""naughty bits.""  Further, Man Ray painted different parts of her body and feminist critics have said this dismembering of women, or reducing them to fractions unconnected to the whole, can be demeaning and misogynist.  In all fairness, no one seems to have forced Ms. Miller in front of the camera.  Also, she modeled right after First Wave feminism ended and decades before Second Wave feminism was to begin.  Still, if it bothers you when women are valued for their minds more than their bodies, you may detest the first half of this documentary.",1212105600,4,2443,4.651869158878505
