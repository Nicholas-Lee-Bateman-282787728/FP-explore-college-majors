she gives a really nice warm up then rhythmic movement then floor work and then a (almost too brief) stretch/relaxation at the end.  that being said she does not come off as perky or artificial or annoying and the exercises are challenging without being too hard",1176336000,,325,4.684210526315789
2651077,5,B000I2J6K0,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product, but I felt I had to say something about this DVD. I have always been a fitness enthusiast, but for the last year or so had let it slide, and then I had a high-risk first trimester and did nothing. But I've been doing the workout nearly daily for the last couple of months (I'm at 7 mos). At the beginning I did everything very gingerly until I was confident that all the moves were safe etc., and I have never had a problem. As soon as the warmup starts, it puts me in the mood to workout and the 40 minutes speed by. My belly is *huge* but I feel strong and toned everywhere else, which is nice. After the workout I often do 20-30 minutes of yoga (Sara Holliday).

Anyway, the DVD has made a difference in my pregnancy, both physically and psychologically, and I wanted to recommend it.",1175731200,60,842,4.197530864197531
2651078,3,B000I2J6K0,"I did the 40 minute routine for the 1st time yesterday. I am only 8 weeks pregnant and found this DVD to be somewhat challenging.  I can't imagine what it would be like for someone who is further along.  I would recommend this workout for someone that is already a seasoned exerciser. It's fast paced, so I would not recommend this DVD for a beginner.  I am an avid runner (average 8-15 miles/week) and regular gym visitor (4 days/week using an elliptical and bike), a yoga student (1-2 days/week) and a former step aerobic student.  What I didn't like about this routine was that I had to re-arrange my furniture in order to do some of the exercises in Segment 1 (the 40 minutes is divided into 4 segments.)  I wished the DVD had prepared me for what was needed as far as ""equipment."" I had to keep running around the living room/dining room to ""find"" and ""arrange"" the needed equipment. So those of you that wish to purchase this DVD, you will need a sturdy coffee table, the edge of your couch, a flat wall, a dining room chair, a living room cushioned chair (I don't have one of these and used the loveseat) and an exercise mat. The other thing I didn't like about the DVD were some of the crazy camera angles and the fact that Erin doesn't always countdown the number of reps.  For some of the floor exercises, you are supposed to keep a long neck (looking down while on all fours), however Erin wasn't giving instructions and I had to keep looking up at the TV to figure out what I supposed to be doing.  Overall, I did have a pretty good workout. It got my heart rate up and I did sweat a little.  I'm sure I will get better at keeping up with the routine.",1170892800,110,1663,4.2907348242811505
2651079,5,B000I2J6K0,"I gifted Erin's Prenatal Fitness Fix DVD to friends that are expecting.
With great thanks for Erin's DVD here what they thought!!!!

1st TIME MOM.....I wanted to stay active. However I found my self sitting. My body was changing I felt awkward exercising.  Erin's workout what just what I needed to activate myself again!!  I feel great!

2nd Time MOM...Erin's workout is my golden Mom time...Stress release and energy booster!!  I feel great and my friends tell me I look great!

4 children and not expecting... Erin's workout rejuvenates me.  I need a lot of energy and even more stress release.  I find tranquility when I am working out to Erin's workout.  My husband tells me how great I look and I know how great I feel!!!

Truly the gift that keeps on giving!!!",1169683200,,767,4.656716417910448

2651081,3,B000I2J6K0,This video is very fast moving and really gets your heart rate up. I had to slow down many times in order to keep my heart rate at a healthy level. If you are enjoy a heavy workout you will love this dvd.,1167350400,5,204,3.7674418604651163

2651086,5,B000I2J6K0,"Purchased for a friend who is early in her 2nd trimester, came highly recommended.  Her review:
5 stars for the 40min solo workout; got the heart pumping, sweat going, and some sore muscles on following day.  No special equipment needed; utilizes the edge of a coffee table, arm of a couch/armchair, wall, and firm standard height dining/kitchen chair when it's not standing or floor work.  I recommend a yoga mat or cushy exercise mat for the floor work to cushion knees, butt, and hips.

Haven't tried out the included 20min partner workout yet but looks good from sitting and watching through it.

Sometimes the videography (40min workout) can be distracting when it goes ""artistic"" for a second or two (i.e. back-lit black and white, showing multiple instances of Erin in the frame during a count-down sequence), but for the most part the brief periods from other angles help show proper form/posture.

I like that she includes ""drink water!"" reminders throughout, and tells the viewer to pause for potty breaks as needed.",1466380800,3,1026,4.970760233918129

2651088,4,B000I2J6K0,"I found reviews really helpful when selecting an exercise DVD while pregnant. Now that I'm 11 weeks post c-section I thought I would share my thoughts. This review is coming from a non runner and a non gym member. I would do Jillian Michaels 30 day shred or some cardio kettlebell a few times a week prior to pregnancy.

SUZANNE BOWEN'S SLIM & TONED - This was my favorite of the DVDs I bought. I didn't really feel like it was difficult until around 28 weeks but I think it did a good job keeping me toned and strong. The first section of lower body I usually skipped because it didn't feel like it was doing much but the other sections were great. Suzanne is a good instructor and not overly peppy or irritating. I would suggest skipping the plank portion of the arm/upper body workout after 25 weeks or so if you're worried about diastasis recti (I was). It has been a great postpartum workout and I think it will help me transition back to the harder DVDs I was doing pre pregnancy.

PRENATAL FITNESS FIX - All the reviews are right, the production quality of this DVD is amateur. However, it does kind of give an intimate, non intimidating approach to working out. Sometimes it nice when you're pregnant and feeling a little lumpy in your workout gear to look at another woman who is very pregnant and not looking glamourous. She is also very funny in a goofy way which is good when you're not in the mood to workout. She gets you going even if you are laughing through it. I had trouble with the squat portions when she does them very quickly. It would make my knees sore the next day. Besides that it was a good, quick workout.

JENNIFER WOLFE'S PRENATAL VINYASA YOGA: SHORT FORMS - I HATED this DVD. I wish I wouldn't have bought it. Again, the production quality is bad. Maybe I'm too used to the GAIAM yoga DVDS but this was terrible. The instructor reminded me of a new age librarian and the Shavasana was impossible to do with the grating acoustic guitar. The main reason I bought a yoga DVD was to relax and stretch during pregnancy and this was a mega fail. Also, it heavily features downward dog, which if you're worried about diastasis recti then you won't want to do this DVD.

EXPECTING MORE: SARA HALEY - I wish I would have found this DVD earlier in my pregnancy. I didn't buy it until week 33. It has a plan included to help you make the most of the different sections at different stages of your pregnancy. I didn't get to explore the other sections as much as I would have if I started this earlier. Some routines require more space than I had in my living room to move around and some would be great while your belly is smaller but in later stages of your pregnancy it might not be a great idea. She does do some kinda cheesy things like naming moves after baby things and stressing how sexy she wants you to feel in pregnancy. The cardio was great though and the best you'll find in a prenatal DVD. The hip hop dance was too stupid for me to spend time on but if you like dance maybe you'll like it. Now that I'm postpartum I may try portions of this DVD again.",1464998400,6,3086,4.31551724137931
2651089,3,B000I2J6K0,"I haven't been working out, it caused a lot of pain in my lower belly when I first went back to working out at about 21 weeks pregnant. I ordered this DVD from Barnes and noble, at about 25 weeks pregnant and am very happy with it. I did learn my coordination is WAY off, but hopefully from this point on it will come back. At 26 weeks pregnant I was able to do everything in the DVD, though not as many reps, due to not having been at it for a while. I watched a bit of the partner section, I don't see me doing that set, but I did notice how NOT enthusiastic her poor hubby was at being in the video. (Not sure how many others noticed that)",1464566400,,642,3.9083969465648853
2651090,5,B000I2J6K0,"I am almost 15 weeks pregnant and definitely found this DVD to be challenging, BUT I'm glad its that way, the point of a workout is to sweat and to feel like you've actually worked your muscles and this does it for me, I ordered it a few weeks ago and just got the energy to try it out, and I will admit I only made it halfway through the first time before my legs were complete jello and I was out of breath but I know if I keep with it it will do exactly what I want it to! Great DVD and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good prenatal workout DVD.",1458172800,,561,3.8034188034188032
2651091,2,B000I2J6K0,My least favorite prenatal DVD.  I did it once and not likely to again.  The workout is not bad but I found the camera angles annoying and she acts goofy,1457308800,,153,4.066666666666666
2651092,3,B000I2J6K0,"The content of this video is very outdated and I had a hard time getting through it without laughing. And the partner workout is supposed to be 20 minutes but I'm pretty sure it's more like 15. Although, I did this workout after not doing much exercise over the past 6 months and it left me very sore the next day so without regular use I think it gets the job done.",1456704000,,366,4.097222222222222
2651093,5,B000I2J6K0,"Okay, I'll admit that when I first received this, I thought I had wasted my money.  It was not at all challenging for me at 22 weeks pregnant. (I was accustomed to doing much more difficult workouts and running long distances.)  I went back to my regular workout routine for about another three or four weeks.  When that became too difficult, I tried this again and it did leave me winded and feeling like I had gotten a workout.  I'm now 37 weeks and have continued this along with walking and I must say it is very good for those later weeks.  I usually get a bit sore from it and definitely feel that I've done some good without doing too much.  Overall, I'm glad I purchased this workout, although for me, it was most  beneficial only in later pregnancy.",1454803200,,758,4.371428571428571

2651095,3,B000I2J6K0,"I bought this because it is too cold to go running outside at my regular 5:45AM start time. I wanted something that made me feel like I worked out. While I do break a sweat and was a little sore after my first day, I can only rate this DVD ""ok.""  The music is super cheesy, but I can get past that. It is a very low budget film.  The sound (i.e., Erin's instructions) is poor, the lighting is poor, the camera angles at times are just bad, it seriously seems like something an amateur put together.  Also, there is no clock or timer, so you do not know how long you have been working out or how much longer you have. This is especially important when this is not your first pregnancy and you have a little one asking you ""mommy when are you going to be finished?""  There is really only one workout on this DVD.  There is a partner workout, but that does not interest me at all, so as far as individual workouts, there is only one and it is 40 minutes. I wanted to really like this, but I don't. I would not recommend it.",1452816000,,1020,4.08
2651096,5,B000I2J6K0,"As I approach my due date (I'm 33 weeks along) and find it harder and harder to walk or sleep normally, I decided to try this workout in order to tire myself out and finally be able to snooze through the night. Today was my first go a it. As someone who was mildly active before the pregnancy, I was able to complete the 40min workout without too much trouble. It was the right amount of challenge for me. I need to specify that I haven't been very active during this pregnancy (worked out only 4 times in 33 weeks) and I was still able to complete the portion of the workout that doesn't require a partner. I definitely recommend this.",1450828800,,636,4.264462809917355
2651097,1,B000I2J6K0,This video is SOOOO weird!!! I never even got past the first 5 minutes because it was so awful.  Its very cheap cinematography and my husband and I couldn't tell if it was a joke or not.  I do not recommend buying this dvd.,1450137600,,223,4.045454545454546
2651098,2,B000I2J6K0,"I really enjoyed doing this routine from the 2nd semester up until 2-3 days before I've given birth! It gave me loads of energy and helped to get rid from back pains plus improved my sleep.
HOWEVER. Now postpartum, I have weird problem with both of my knees - they do not hurt, but something is wrong there as bones or ligaments seem to be out of place. I blame this workout for that.. All these bends should not be done by pregnant women! (Especially ones where you bend one knee only and place the other behind).

The weird camera angles and filters, combined with the lack of communication from Ms. O-Brien made what could have been a nice challenging workout into an exercise in frustration.  I turned it on and actually thought the first three minutes were a ""B-Roll"" spoof of an old exercise video that would be labeled ineffective/out of date.  It is grainy, in her living room, and riddled with weird silhouettes, black and white shots, and close ups of her mouth when she drinks from a water bottle. When it kept going, I realized it wasn't an introduction so I started in and struggled to keep up.  You have to use furniture (mine slides on hard wood floors), so I used the stairs instead of the couch.  Because she doesn't actually tell you when she is changing exercises, and I couldn't see the TV, I was behind for most of the rest.

It began with a really cheesy introduction which I did NOT care for, nor did I find the least bit helpful, and then almost without warning she just began the workout badly filmed with muffled sound and a poorly led, disjointed, and confusing routine.

The worst part about this video was its distracting camera angles and filter effects. She would be in the middle of an exercise and the screen would switch to black and white or her body backlit or weird third and fourth party phantoms of herself.

2651207,4,B000I2J6K0,"I did much research during both of my pregnancies for a good prenatal workout DVD since my usual routines were not pregnancy-friendly. Many moms told me about Erin O'Brien's workout and they glowed with positive reviews.

The entire workout seems to be filmed from a large apartment's living room, so the DVD lost some quality IMHO. I was slightly annoyed with how slow everything was and just the way things were verbalized (lol) so I would just mute the DVD and go along.

I have yet to find a significantly better workout DVD for pregnancy, but if you are even moderately in shape prior to pregnancy this won't knock your socks off.

If you are just starting your fitness regimen during pregnancy this will most likely be a great way to involve exercise into your pregnancy.",1402358400,,777,4.698529411764706

That said, this DVD is poorly filmed in a date way--90's cuts, spins, negative shots, and in general far too much camera movement. If you like a clean studio feel and a steady camera, this DVD not for you (or me). If the home living room is a cozy feel to you, and you can put up with the distracting jostling and (dis)coloration of the video, then go for it. 10 Minute prenatal Pilates gets my vote.",1394755200,,528,4.343434343434343

Originally I got Shiva Rea's pregnancy yoga dvd because I love yoga. Pre-preggo, I went to the gym a few times a week, including one yoga class a week. Turns out I don't like yoga as much pregnant. I still use it occasionally, but find that the stretching routine in my active birth book works better than the yoga. Anyway, this dvd is more fun for me, which means I actually use it. It's fun, easy to follow, not so short that you're bored, but not so long that you're exhausted. And the partner workout is fun, but short, so it isn't a chore for the person you get to help. I highly recommend this to the pregnant woman who is anywhere between gym rat and couch potato.",1393545600,,783,4.226666666666667

I should add, I am about 22 weeks and she is clearly further along than me, so I think this workout will be perfect for when I'm even bigger!",1386201600,,433,4.094117647058823

I bike and walk regularly and before this video I had been doing the 10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates, which is great, but doesn't get my heart rate up and isn't quite challenging enough for me.

Other reviews complained about quality of production and that it was filmed in her living room. Again this motivated me to do the DVD, a more realistic atmosphere to what I have at home compared to the DVDs shot in a studio gym. Very good pace, not too hard but definitely a great workout!

I actually tried doing a bit of this work out in my early 2nd trimester, and I was overwhelmed both by the intensity and by the fact that Erin was performing it so far along in her own pregnancy. I absolutely DO NOT recommend it - your pregnant body is at the gym most of the time already, since it is building a baby.  However, the Postnatal Rescue dvd by Erin O'Brien is a very good and well thought out training dvd.",1383696000,,549,4.320388349514563

Yoga once a week is all we could really afford, so we bought a few pre-natal dvds hoping that would make it easier on my schedule and wallet. I have tried about 6 different dvds now and this one is my favorite.

Pros
Easy to follow
Not boring
Pushes you, but not too much
A darn good workout
Got me back into shape and gave me much more energy
Love the partner work out at the end

Cons
I wish she had more dvds!
May not be best for people who haven't worked out before. Make sure to modify!

Once you get past that, I thought it was great.  I am only in my 1st trimester, but I really enjoyed the workout.  I was working out moderately before hand and didn't find it difficult to keep up nor was it too easy.

Once you have watched it once you will be prepared to move from chair to floor to wall, etc.  It is very easy to follow.  The pace gets your heart rate up while your muscles are being toned, which is my favorite way to work out.  I am not in to spending additional time doing just ""cardio"".  This workout is efficient.",1380758400,,505,4.040404040404041

I  was  skeptical about buying my first prenatal video. I  was  very active before getting pregnant and wanted something that  would challenge me. There  are so many  choices and  in the end I  went with Erin.  Probably the  best decision I  could have made.  She combines  cardio  with  Pilates for a full body workout.

However because of some early complications in my pregnancy, I was unable to continue running or my normal level of cardio. Most of the pregnancy workouts I found did not seem intense enough, I was looking for a pregnancy workout that was challenging enough to keep me at from losing too much conditioning during my pregnancy. Erin O'Brien's prenatal fitness fix was just what I was looking for. Erin is a personal trainer and is in her third trimester during the workout. She takes you through a series of low impact moves that keep your heart rate elevated enough to get a cardio workout and break a good sweat but without pushing it too much. She also includes toning exercises specifically targeted at your pelvic girdle and buttocks to help prepare your body for labor. I used this video 2-3 times per week and also walked 2-3 miles a few times per week up until I gave birth. I really felt this helped to limit my weight gain and helped make my labor easier. As some of the previous reviewers mentioned, the DVD is filmed in her home and the production isn't great, it almost has a home-made feel to it. Plus the background music is kind of strange. But these things never bothered me because the actual workout itself was enjoyable and worth it. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a challenging pregnancy workout!",1374364800,3,1484,4.64638783269962

I was an active person before getting pregnant (mostly mountain biking, some jogging or gym), and the first time I tried this video, it kicked my butt!  My legs were wobbly and I was sore the next day, and this was just the first trimester.  I continued doing the video a couple times a week because it moves fast, has good instruction, and was fun.  I always felt stronger and looser (especially my back and neck!) after doing it.  It got easier as I got stronger, and by the end of my pregnancy, I almost felt more full-body strength than before I was pregnant!  Erin is reasonable and understanding about pregnancy issues (tummy gets in the way, always have to pee, etc.), but has a positive and motivational attitude.  The 40 minutes flew by every time I did this routine since the intervals for each exercise are short and it keeps the pace moving.  I liked that I also felt I got a decent cardio workout (more than yoga, but still in the ~140 bpm max recommended during pregnancy).  Now that my baby is born, I've transitioned to the postnatal video (more like rehab, starting very simple and slow with various levels of progression), and I am regaining my core strength, flexibility, and balance again.

Erin understands the needs and concerns of pregnant women, reminding you of important health tips, taking water and bathroom breaks, and offering encouragement and realism. She even seems a little affected by the workout, but reminds us that ""you're okay!"" as we push through the tough parts.

For a super fit, early pregnancy mom, this may not be very strenuous, but for someone advanced in pregnancy or a bit off track on fitness, the workout can be altered to be possible and helpful.

It does seem like a fairly low-budget production, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but the workout is a good one, so I don't mind. There are a couple times she seems to spazz out a little bit, but I think it's kind of funny... She reminds me of Cheri Oteri from Saturday Night Live in the late 90s.

You certainly feel like you are doing something with this video, whereas with Fitmama it seems like a warm up or cool down video. I strongly recommend you get it IF you were an avid exerciser before.

When I hit my third trimester it was hard sometimes then I only did 25 minutes of the 40 minute workout. The ground work portion gave me incredible heartburn so I usually stopped before that and went for a walk.

2651322,5,B000I2J6K0,"I will start by saying that I am quite skinny and fit (5'11"" tall, 135lb before pregnancy). I loved to work out before I got pregnant and was looking for a fun, dynamic workout routine that would be safe during pregnancy. I would like to stress that I really wanted to find an active workout, so I stayed away from yoga. I tried these:
- Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix
- The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1
- 10 minute solution: prenatal pilates (2007)

Of these three, Erin O'Brien's is by far my favourite. I got this DVD in my 12th week of pregnancy because I wanted to do exercises that were safe for my baby. Here are the major points that I like about this DVD:

1) A variety of exercises keeps the whole body tuned. While the DVD is only 40 minutes long, it covers everything. The first part is cardio - not too intense, just enough to warm up and get the heart beating a bit faster. Then there are some stretches that feel really good. Then there are various leg, body, and arm exercises - a lot of squats, a few pushups, back and belly exercises. Next section is on the floor - some more leg and butt exercises and back exercises. Finally, the last section is stretch and relaxation, which is a great way to end the workout and bring the heart beat back to normal. This is in contrast to The perfect pregnancy workout, which I found unbalanced.

2) No equipment is required. I was looking for a DVD that I can comfortably do in my living room. The whole point of Erin O'Brien's workout is that it can be done in your living room! All you need is a chair really! This is in contrast to the 10 minute solution: prenatal pilates, which require a few other pieces of equipment.

3) The whole workout lasts a bit less than 40 minutes! I usually do it in the mornings before I go to work - about 3 times a week. It's just short enough to not delay me too much in my day, but long enough to exercise every part of my body!

The only warning that I would like to add is that I am very happy that I started doing this early on in my pregnancy (in my 12th week). I offered this DVD to my friend who was 25 weeks pregnant because she was complaining about pretty bad pain in her lower back. She said that it was too hard for her to start these exercises now, and I could see how that could be the case... So unless you have been exercising all along, this might be a tad too difficult to start in your second trimester, and you are better off going with one of the yoga workouts.",1359849600,,2483,4.175365344467641

If you expect your fitness crazy friend coming to your living room and leading you in some exercise then this is good. It's not a professional workout video.

If you are not used to working out or are not in shape already, it might be a bit challenging for you.

She does use a chair and wall for some of the moves, but you don't need any weights or other workout equipment. It's divided into two parts, the first is 40 minutes and the second you do with your partner. That one is only 20 minutes. I haven't done the second workout yet.",1357257600,,554,4.08256880733945

2651342,5,B000I2J6K0,"This is my first review of a work-out video, but I had to give this 5 stars. Erin is awesome! I'm 27 weeks along with my first pregnancy. Before I became pregnant I was working out about 6 days per week, but my first trimester was really hard. I stopped working out all together and lost my motivation. My second trimester has been much better and I'm trying to build that strength back up. This video will definitely help!

What I love about it:
- I love that its in Erin's home and that she uses coffee tables and couches for some stretches and workout moves
- Erin is both motivating and soothing at the same time
- None of the workouts felt like I was putting myself at risk
- I was definitely challenged!
- It was fun, I don't think I'll get bored with it before its delivery time!

The first section is about 35 minutes long which is perfect for me. The second set is done with a partner which I have yet to try - but it looks fun too!",1356048000,,941,4.108695652173913
2651343,4,B000I2J6K0,"I had been regularly working out using Jillian Michaels DVDs when I became pregnant.  After switching to light cardio only in the first trimester, I decided I still needed some sort of resistance training.  When I tried this early in my second trimester I thought it was a joke!  Compared to 30 Day Shred, this DVD is like taking a nap on your couch!  However, I am now well into my third trimester and this exercise DVD is probably just about perfect for my needs right now.  I told my husband, ""I kept expecting it to just get easier but it keeps getting harder!""  I feel like it does a good job of hitting various parts of the body.

I'm giving it four stars because the production quality is REALLY low.  And I know that doing workout DVDs means that you will have to listen to the same banter from the instructor over and over, but her constant reminders about not overextending my back get annoying.

After reading the rave reviews regarding this workout I thought I had found the workout I was looking for. I will say the workout itself is not bad...but THE PRODUCTION IS HORRIBLE! The instructor takes several ""pee breaks"" and pauses foor water. Although some may find this comical I do not. I am quite able to pause the dvd on my own for breaks.

2651350,1,B000I2J6K0,"When I first found out we were pregnant I was preparing to train for my first half marathon, had canceled by gym membership since I wasn't using it and was overall pretty active.  My goal was to keep up with this my entire pregnancy and to help me do so I decided to purchase a few prenatal DVD's to do at home workouts.  After looking over reviews of a number of prenatal fitness and yoga DVD's on Amazon I finally settled on three- one yoga and two fitness.  One of the fitness DVD's I chose was Prenatal Fitness Fix with Erin O'Brien which received 4.5 stars and 134 reviews on Amazon, making you think that it was a a great workout DVD.

Well boy was I surprised when I first turned it on and it was nothing like what you would expect from the reviews or the cover.  The DVD is first of so out dated.  I felt like I was watching an old 80's workout DVD with awful music.  The picture quality was awful, the set up was dim and looked like it had been tapped in her living room one afternoon.  I also felt like the whole workout was something similar to what my mom used to do in our living room when I was a child.

Well I did the workout a few times and just couldn't get into it at all, it was pretty awful.  Having apparently not learned my lesson this week I decided to try one more time but this time do the partner workout with my husband.  Well let me tell you it was worse than the regular workout.  Calling it a ""partner workout"" is stretching it a bit or at least it wasn't what my husband and I were expecting.  We were both expecting to get a workout, but instead the partner part of it was basically me using him as support or resistance while I worked out.  Honestly my husband was just about as thrilled to participate as her husband seemed to be in the DVD.  The partner workout really could have been done on your own using bands and a table or chair for needed assistance; it was actually more awkward to have my husband help me than anything.

Overall this receives a 0 star rating for me.  I would not recommend this to anyone.",1331856000,,2050,4.149367088607595

I had to pause to get somethings that I would have liked to collect before starting but it really wasn't that inconvenient. There's an abundance of prenatal yoga videos out there and I love yoga but really, I can only do so much.

However, after just a few times through the video, I'm familiar enough with it that it's no longer a problem. I've also never bothered to ""collect"" all the furniture needed to assist me, but it's easy to modify the workout to suit what I do have. It's broken into 4 segments: warm-up, dynamic movement, floor workout, and then stretch and relaxation.  I've been doing this workout every morning, and it makes me feel so good, I've even repeated it a few nights doing just the last two.

Quick about me:  physician, 26 weeks pregnant with baby #2

Pros:
The host is motivating without being overly peppy and annoying
The host is actually pregnant herself
You get a good workout, but it's broken up so you don't feel overworked
She actually programs time to drink water as a part of the workout (only about 10 sec segments)

Cons:
It is only the host by herself in a room, therefore only 1 difficulty level (unlike other DVD's I've tried)
If you're used to watching HD TV, you will notice a detriment in video and sound quality
I was a Master's level swimmer through my first trimester...this was a good workout for me (not easy)

Other Thoughts:
Don't get this if you haven't been working out already
exercises: aerobics, squats, kicks, modified push ups, tricep dips, Pilates, about 5% yoga",1322870400,,865,4.633986928104576

I've been taking group exercises classes designed for pregnant women and always feel great after the classes.  But I wanted to find something I could do at home on days I can't make it to the gym.  After completing the 40 minute workout yesterday, I had extreme round ligament pain and lower back pain.  I followed the instructions pretty precisely, so I don't think it's anything I did incorrectly.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so severe for someone not quite as far along, but I won't be downloading it again.

PROS:
-a really good cardio workout - definitely got my heart pumping
-variety - she does a good job of changing up the exercises - definitely not boring

CONS:
-for me, this workout caused significant discomfort after the fact and I ended up feeling worse - vs better - after the workout. I've been hobbling around all day today (one day following the workout)

I started feeling like I was completely losing all of my muscle tone. The last I wanted to feel, on top of everything else going on in my body, was soft and out of shape. This DVD targets all the areas I was concerned about (biceps, triceps and thighs). It also gets your heart rate up without causing you to feel like you are over-doing it. Another bonus is that you don't have to buy equipment along with the dvd. She uses her coffee table, a chair and the wall. I personally love this DVD and I am so glad that I found it.

However, after I learned what moves were coming up, I wasn't wasting time watching what she was doing and could get every rep in, which helped a lot. I wouldn't consider this intense cardio, but it does raise my heart rate and gets me a little winded. I was used to doing the Insanity workout, and continued with it until 21 weeks.

I find too many of the other prenatal vids are too slow and only focus on stretching or yoga-based movements. Pregnant women still (with their doctor's consent) need to do sustained and safe cardio!

2651413,5,B000I2J6K0,"I am 6 weeks pregnant with my sixth child and was looking for something different, something a bit more active with a great routine for strengthening muscles and good cardio, appropriate for pregnancy. I have been using Jillian Michaels workouts sporadically at home over the last year, so I haven't been completely sedentary, but sporadic enough that my endurance isn't very good.

I found this DVD to be appropriately (for pregnancy) challenging and fun. She does move quickly through the moves sometimes, but if you just modify it and work at YOUR pace, stick with the double-time reps when she moves to singles, etc., I think a beginner could do this workout just fine. As your endurance and strength increase, and as you become familiar with the moves and routine, you will feel stronger and your pregnant body will be toned and ready for delivery. I am using the DVD in this way - to build up my muscle strength and endurance while I'm still in early pregnancy, and then to give me a good workout throughout my pregnancy. I did this workout for the first time this morning, and now, an hour later, my obliques and abs (upper abs, under the ribs - sorry I don't know the technical term) and quads are tight and I can tell I got a good workout. The music is a little hokey, but I didn't notice it much. She has a great personality, great knowledge of fitness, good posture, etc. She is a lot of fun.

The partner workout looks like it would be fun. She uses her husband to add resistance to wall push-ups and other strength moves. It could be a fun way for you and your husband/partner to do something together. It seems designed to give an opportunity to work out/spend time with your partner or a friend, and by increasing the difficulty of the strength moves, it thereby increases your muscle strength and muscle tone.

I haven't looked at the post-natal workout, but I am optimistic it will be just as great as this one.  Great DVD, great buy!",1295308800,,1951,4.54985754985755

I liked how it was in a home setting, not a cheezy 80's arobic room, so I didn't feel silly doing the workout. She's a good coach, fun to work out to. Totally recomend this DVD",1295222400,,499,3.854368932038835
2651415,1,B000I2J6K0,"Thankfully, I only borrowed this from the library--would have been highly disappointed had I purchased at ANY price.  I am only 2 months along, in fairly decent shape, but haven't been active for a few months and want to get back into routine.  First of all, she does not let you know what equipment you will need (see other reviews) to do this, and I really hated pausing to get what I needed as the video progressed.  I couldn't do 2 of the exercises because 1.) I do not have a chair that is wide enough to properly do the triceps bends (I'm not a big person, I just apparently have skinny dining room chairs!) and 2.) I do not have a big expanse of bare wall readily available to do the push-ups moves and still be able to see the video.  The so-called ""warm-up"" is WAAAAY too intense, especially if you are out of routine like me.  She changes moves too often, very annoying.  It gets a bit better after the crazy warm-up, as she actually explains the moves somewhat.  Like another reviewer mentioned, she doesn't tell you how many counts to do most of the time, then suddenly counts down once in a while.  It is not a fun video, and the challenge of it lies more in trying to keep up with all the switching moves and figure out modifications (if possible) for not having the exact same living room setup as she does than the actual workout routine.  Will be taking this one back right away and hunting for an easier to follow video that doesn't prompt me to 'pause if you need to pee'.",1295136000,,1491,4.315412186379929
2651416,5,B000I2J6K0,"I love this video!  I exercised frequently before pregnancy, so it was really easy in the beginning.  However, by the end of the first trimester I found it harder!

Erin O'Brien's personality comes through in the video, and she's great.  Not perky or peppy, just calm, informed, funny and positive.  I alomost feel as though I am working with my own down-to-earth personal trainer.  The video appears to be recorded in a home, her home, I don't know.  So it has a ""home recording"" type quality to it.  Not at all poor quality, just not in a studio with lights and lots of loud music.

I get a good, toning workout, with a few times of elevated heart rate.  Yet, this DVD is more for toning than a full on cardio workout.  Lots of squats, lunges, glute work.  She stays away from abdonminal exercises which feels safer to me, but does remind you to focus on pulling in your belly.  No exercises are done flat on your back either.  Great video -- but still include some more cardio in your regimen!",1294704000,,996,4.430939226519337
2651417,5,B000I2J6K0,"I used this video in my first pregnancy. It was difficult then, but I liked it. I couldn't do the entire workout, but I could do most of it. I skipped through the few parts that were difficult for me at the time. This 2nd pregnancy, I had already been working out to Erin O'Brien's Strong Body, Ageless Body, and I started Prenatal Fitness Fix at about 9 weeks pregnant. I can do all of the exercises this time. I'm glad I started this workout so early in pregnancy. :-) This is by far my favorite pregnancy workout. I am building muscle and I feel strong.

That said, I can see where folks think this is not necessarily geared toward beginners. I personally think that's great because those intermediate and advanced among us need challenging prenatal workouts. I have Denise Austin's prenatal workout and also Fit Mama by Leisa Hart, both of which I find to be way too easy. Prenatal Fitness Fix is realistically challenging.

Many reviewers talk about how there isn't much upper body work in this workout. This is where the 20 minute partner workout comes in. Seriously. There are several exercises for the upper body using the resistance of your partner. The partner workout is my favorite part of the entire workout, so please don't hesitate to try it. It does the *most* for me physically and makes me feel super strong. Plus, it's fun. Admittedly, I felt a little awkward initially pulling my partner in to work out with me, or to serve as my prop. I waited until I could do the entire 40 minute segment without difficulty first. But when we did the partner workout for the first time, we both enjoyed it and the time flew by. This segment of the workout really compliments the main 40 minute section. Again, it's my favorite part of the video and it's where the extra arm work is that so many feel is lacking in the 40 minute workout. Try it. My husband even enjoyed it, and it helped to involve him in the pregnancy, and to feel that he is supporting me in remaining healthy and fit.

I actually liked the very things other reviewers have complained about. It's not about hype. It's about exercising in our homes, in order to have a healthy pregnancy. This video is simple. It takes place in a living room. It's relaxing and calming. It's real. And it's motivating and inspiring.",1294358400,,2288,4.535108958837772

It makes me feel great and I feel like I am doing something worthwhile for my body. This is my 3rd baby and I have tried a lot of other pregnancy workouts; none have been as good as this one. I would definitely recommend this one!",1294099200,,534,3.9537037037037037

It gives you a sense you can do it at home.  However, the lighting is terrible.  The sun is in your eyes and just incredibly shadowy.  Besides that she uses her furniture for all of the exercises.  Again, you think great.  You'll be able to do this at home.  That is probably the case if you have traditional furniture, sofa, coffee table, and chair.  However, I have an automan instead of a coffee table, my couch is against the wall.  So?  Other than that it is just boring, with elevator music playing in the back ground.  A positive is that it does look like a good work out.  I do a lot of exercise with videos at home.  So I can see that it looks safe and has a good intensity.  I just couldn't stand to watch the thing.",1290643200,,889,4.105263157894737

The video has you use a chair and sofas to do strength trianing so no weights or tools required. I could see when I've doubled in size this video being aerobically taxing (in a good way). The video is filmed in a living room and it's just you and Erin. The video has a very personal feel to me. Erin O'Brien even has to run off to pee (I'm sure it's staged but it's cute and I like it). I would recommend this video highly.",1289260800,,589,4.130434782608695

Feels good to be active again. I also LOVE the fact that I didn't have to buy any extra equipment to use it.",1289174400,,269,3.909090909090909
2651443,5,B000I2J6K0,"Out of the 3 prenatal WORKOUT-workout (i.e. not yoga/pilates) DVDs I've purchased, this is the middle ground one - it's not as vigorous as Teddi Bryant but it's more of a workout than Leisa Hart.  Consequently this is happily the one I do the most!  It's only 40 minutes which makes it easy for me to do the whole thing in the mornings before work (& yeah sometimes I only have time to do parts of my DVDs but that's another story).  Note I am a regular exerciser, am ""advanced"" in workout-DVDspeak - I normally do 3-5 days of cardio/strength a week at the gym (was an avid spinner/stepper until knee issues occurred 10/2009, now I do just cardio machines for aerobics).  I'd call this DVD intermediate to intermediate/advanced.  The first time I did this in my 2nd trimester, I definitely could feel the workout but it was very doable; it's work but not strenuous work.  I continue to feel this way throughout my pregnancy (I'm 33 wks now) - it's a workout, but it's not SUPERvigorous.  Which makes an outstanding daily workout.  BUT if you're a gym rat that needs a big dose of endorphins (not the moderate regular gulp that this gives you), I suggest supplementing this DVD with more strenuous activities like regular gym workouts or Teddi Bryant's prenatal workout.  If you're okay with moderate-to-advanced activity, or are at an intermediate/beginner level, this DVD would be perfect as your only workout (or one of a few workouts).  Erin works your whole body with excellent explanations - you know everything is pregnancy-safe & you get lots of info about the changes in your body.  AND Erin has a terrific personality - friendly, fun, articulate!  Yes it's in a ""living room"" setting (is that coffee table really a piece of glass on stacks of books? heh) but at least it's a bright, warming & welcoming room.  The workout uses stuff most people can find in their own homes - a sofa/easy chair, a doorway or wall, a straight back chair - so not having to drag out extra exercise equipment is refreshing.  Sure the music (synthesized kids' music/lullabies) isn't ideal & I wish there was more cardio but I'm finding prenatal videos as a whole don't really have much cardio... trust me, your pulse will get going when you do strength while preggo!  I haven't tried the partner workout but I'm wondering if James Denton was trying to be funny by being so lackadaisical in the beginning...c'mon James, show some support & enthusiasm!  Your wife is rocking this prenatal workout!  Some of the things that Erin says in the relaxation/stretch get me emotional, in a good way... what a great way to end the DVD.  This workout leaves me feeling wonderful & I highly recommend it. :)",1288224000,,2681,4.6923076923076925
2651444,5,B000I2J6K0,"I love this workout!!! I haven't done the partner section of it yet, but the other part is great (I wish it was just a bit longer-but I guess 40min is not too bad).
I def sweat and can feel my heart rate go up-and I used to work out 5-7days/week before my pregnancy.
The only problem I can see is the sound quality during some parts, I just turn up the volume. And I could do without the part where she makes it a point that we should pause the dvd if we have to use the bathroom and the video actually stops for a few seconds.
But I do like that the instructor gives you tips on form and she is very encouraging, telling you to keep going and not treating you like a weak pregnant woman that should just sit around!!!
Overall it's def a great workout dvd for any pregnant woman that wants to do more than just a few stretches!!!",1287360000,,829,4.03030303030303

I'm feeling good, and I think I owe a lot of that to this workout and the swimming and/or brisk walking I alternate it with.  I've done everything from traditional gym workouts with a trainer to Jillian Michaels to P90X, and I'm content with the cardio and light resistance this DVD provides.  I haven't done the partner workout, so I'm only reviewing the 40-minute individual one.  See below for why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.

Pros:
Good cardio without overdoing it
Lots of squats, lunges, and kickbacks to strengthen quads, hamstrings, and glutes for childbirth and recovery
Enough variety of moves to keep it interesting and challenging
Do-able both for newer exercisers (after going through the workout a few times) and the more experienced
Emphasizes attention to posture and form; both of which are always important but especially vital during pregnancy when you have additional back and ligament strain

Cons:
Music (upbeat childrens' tunes) can be irritating (once you become familiar with the workout, however, you can turn it down or mute it and use your own music)
Non-traditional and informal filming (in her home living room with less-than professional camera work), but makes it feel real and down-to-earth
Not much heavy-duty arm work (only push-ups and dips)
""Relaxation"" portion at very end is pretty hokey",1283472000,,1466,5.012345679012346
2651469,5,B000I2J6K0,"I got this DVD at 30 weeks when I realized how little time I had left to get in decent shape before baby. I would say I was in fairly good shape considering my lack of regular exercise. My first few days pushed me pretty hard and I definitely felt it the next day. I took her recommended shortcuts but tried to keep up the best I could. I'm on my second week now (using the DVD 5-6 days a week) and I can feel that I'm stronger and can stay with her pretty well.

Personally, I prefer working out with someone so I do the partner workout as often as I can-- about 3 days a week. My husband's a very good sport and that extra push/encouragement adds a lot to the workout. I can tell he enjoys it in his own way too. ;)

Admittedly, the production quality isn't the best, but it doesn't bother me any. I appreciate her water reminders and her sensitivity to the pregnant bladder. The lack of extra equipment is a plus as well.",1280361600,,924,4.099447513812155

2651471,4,B000I2J6K0,"I like this workout; Erin keeps the workout moving and I feel like I've exercised all parts once I'm done. I work out every day, and did the same pre-pregnancy. The reason why I'm giving four out of five stars is I wish that instead of a 20 minute partner workout with her husband she would have done a 20 minute ""express"" workout for days you don't have much time. I feel like working out with a partner is pretty goofy -- working out is my ""alone"" de-stress time for me.",1278720000,,472,4.197802197802198

It is such an easy workout to follow and Erin is not overly cheesy and annoying. I also like the fact she is in a ""home"" atmosphere. It gives the feeling you are working out with a friend. The intro is really annoying and I usually skip it. I like the fact that all the props she uses are things you already have in your house. I was running and doing normal physical activities in my first trimester but it got too uncomfortable in the second. I do the extra movements and try to challenge myself and usually end up breaking a sweat. This workout video is a steal for the money!!",1277164800,,732,4.125874125874126

Many of the other videos are far too easy. It would be wise to begin using this video during the first trimester, in order to become accustomed to the movements and intensity level. Expectant mothers PLEASE REMEMBER childbirth is one of the most physically demanding things a woman will ever go through. It is wise to keep your body in the best shape possible!

2651477,4,B000I2J6K0,"I love this workout!!  You'll need a couch, space on the wall, and hard chair (like a kitchen table chair) to do the workouts, but just clear a 6x8 space in your den and you're ready to go.  It's just enough of a heart rate boost to get you going, but nothing that you'll need to worry about.  If it's too much aerobic for you, she shows modifications.  I'd recommend starting this (and other workouts) as early in your pregnancy as you can, so that you're not just starting at 20 weeks when it might be a bit hard the first time.

The first few times I did this, though, boy did my butt and thighs burn!  Lots of squats and glutes, which is good, but can be hard the first few times.  The 40-minute workout is actually more like 35 or so, since the first three minutes are intro, doctor warning, etc, and the end is relaxation.

What's awesome, though, is Erin herself.  She says funny things like, ""you're holding that belly in, right?"" or ""If you need to pee, that's ok, just pause me, I don't like to work out alone.""  Fun stuff, upbeat and super supportive attitude.",1268265600,,1071,4.31

Erin is a great trainer, her workout is straight forward and to the point.  She doesn't have difficult positions - although the workout itself is difficult!  I still have trouble doing all the reps - but she is pushing me!  I didn't workout for the first 14 weeks of my pregnancy, and now am 22 weeks along.  Between her DVD and Summer Sanders I am on my way to at least feeling moderately in shape again.

I was running alot before I got pregnant (and still running now), so I feel like I'm in decent shape.  It definitely wasn't over-exerting, but I finished feeling like I had done something good for my body.

The reason I didn't like the video is that I didn't mesh with Erin O'Brien.  She seems a little intense, and it felt like we were moving from one exercise to another---to get as many exercises in the allotted time.  As has been stated previously, the production quality was pretty poor, and it did feel like they just filmed it in her living room.  It was also somewhat annoying having to move furniture around in order to use the props that she wants to use.

All in all, she gives you a good workout, but I just didn't find it enjoyable.  So far, Lindsay Brin's videos are my favorite.",1264118400,,1058,4.346938775510204
2651491,5,B000I2J6K0,"I initially bought this DVD because the reviews were from avid exercisers who said that it got their heart rate up.  My only problem: I am not an avid exerciser.  I can't remember the last time I did anything, and my exercise during my pregnancy has been limited to the occasional prenatal aqua fit class.  I purchased this DVD at the onset of my 2nd trimester, but hadn't gotten around to do it by 24 weeks (like I said, not a big exerciser).  I was also nervous that it might be too much of a challenge after reading the other reviews.

I was pleasantly surprised with this work-out.  As I started the warm-up I thought to myself ""oh boy, will I survive this?"" but I found it fun, challenging, not exhausting, and moved quickly.  I was not watching the clock during this work-out (if it's too exhausting or boring I tend to).  I liked Erin, she seemed down-to-earth (perhaps it was her lack of make-up) and encouraging (I laughed out loud when she would reassure the viewer by saying ""you're okay!"")

This DVD gets the thumbs up from from active mom's-to-be, and as one who is far from active, I just wanted to add my two cents about this being a fun and totally doable workout.  I'm going to try to incorporate it frequently into my routine, as I am gaining weight quickly despite my healthy diet.  Also, I am concerned about the ""marathon of birth.""

2651492,4,B000I2J6K0,"I ordered this dvd because I was looking for some variety in my prenatal workouts. I am 4 months pregnant with my second child and currently do the elliptical machine and yoga a few times a week. I am a very fit person who has worked out regularly since I was a teenager. I can't always get to the gym so I wanted a dvd that would give me a little cardio boost as well as work muscles that I'm not currently working on the elliptical. This video is a very good solution. The cardio section isn't as long as I hoped it would be but maybe I'll be grateful for that a few months from now! The muscle toning section is surprisingly good, making my inner thighs and lats sore the next morning. Overall, this video is quite similar to the old Jane Fonda videos.

I agree with the other reviews that the video quality is not good but I could care less if it means I'm going to get a decent workout.",1263945600,,891,4.120689655172414

I don't think I broke a sweat once during the entire thing.  I could have folded the laundry and had a better workout.  I was 17 weeks when I tried this and running has become difficult with all the trips to the bathroom and some round ligament pain.  I think this video is meant for people who eiether have never done any type of exercise before or who are in their 7th or 8th month of pregnancy.  I am used to running about 20-30 miles a week so if you are expecting a good heart pumping workout from this you are going to be very dissapointed.  Go for a fast paced walk instead.

The second segment is some moderately challenging lunges, squats, etc.  However, there are several segments that tell you to drink water and then you get to waste your time watching Erin drink water.  Wow, that gets my heart rate up.  At one point, the video freezes, and ""If you have to pee, pause the video"" comes up on the screen. Really?

The third segment is some lame pilates - I could put together a better routine myself.

The fourth segment is stretch and relaxation - I turned the dvd off at this point, out of frustration.

The production quality is laughable - I really think Erin and her husband shot and produced this right out of their house.

This is a great workout for pregant women because the trainer is pregnant and gives you excerises that will help you with the pregancy.  The video can be a little corny at times, but overall it is a quick way to get a workout in and also prepare you for childbirth.  I would not say the workout is hard, but I would not say it is easy either.  She gives you variations so that you can make the workout harder or easier (depending on your fitness level, or just your day).  She works through all the target areas.  The video has a parnter workout section, I have never watched or completed that section so I cannot comment on that portion.  The trainer is very informed and easy to follow.  You do not need extra equipment or a lot of room to do this video.",1256688000,,1068,4.206896551724138
2651497,5,B000I2J6K0,"I bought pregnancy fitness DVDs with trepidation. I have never been much of a fitness fan. I tend to be a bit of a lump. But with my last pregnancy, I gained 80 pounds. As a result of being so heavy and off-balance, I fell and broke my foot, and spent my last trimester in a boot, hobbling around. I was in terrible shape by the time the baby was born, and it took me a year to lose the weight. I am not the type to be obsessed about my weight, but an extra 65 pounds (after baby was born) was pretty unhealthy.

My point being, this time I am determined to stay fit and limber so I won't gain more weight than is healthy (25-35 pounds is recommended), and I won't strain, sprain, or break anything as my body changes. I am at 20 weeks and have been doing this DVD about 3 times a week for a month or so now. At first, it was seriously challenging, mostly because she calls on you to stretch and strengthen so much, especially the thighs! But I feel more energetic and stronger as the weeks pass, have less aches and pains, and I think this workout has really helped. I intersperse it with other DVDs and styles to keep it interesting, but this is by far the best of the 4 I currently own, in  my opinion.

Also, my husband and I are MDs, and the idea that there is anything distinctly unsafe about this workout is ridiculous. I have read that expressed in a couple of other reviews. There is no jumping around, straining of muscles, or any suggestion to lose weight or overexert yourself. This style of workout may not be what you like, but it is not unsafe, if you stay at a level you are personally comfortable with.

Oh, and the partner part is so fun, if you can talk your partner into doing it. I am lucky enough that my husband tries out all of my workouts with me, and we have a great time with the partner workout. I think it really cute to watch Erin and her husband interact.",1255564800,3,1886,4.144808743169399
2651498,4,B000I2J6K0,"I was a little skeptical when buying this dvd because I was looking for a prenatal fitness dvd that would challenge me (seems like most pregnancy videos don't) but wouldn't overwork me to the point of being really out of breath and putting my baby at risk. Let me start by saying that I'm currently 19 weeks, and for the first few months I rarely exercised at all...mostly walking if anything. Before getting pregnant I was fairly fit, ran occasionally for 2-3 miles, but was anything but regular about working out. I was really worried when I saw all of the reviews from ladies who said they were avid runners and yoga enthusiasts and were unable to complete the workout. I had no problem at all completing the entire workout, so please don't let that disuade you. I would say that anyone with a moderate to high level of fitness will be challenged in some area, which is exactly what you want. Beginners may be a little overwhelmed at first, but would probably get through it within a couple of weeks with the modifications that Erin makes. I loved the low-key setting and loved that she used furniture that I easily found within easy reach. (No special weights, steps, etc.) No cheesy workout music and no ungodly insane cheeriness ala Denise Austin. Erin is very down-to-earth and keeps her voice very calm and level. In short, love this dvd!",1255392000,2,1346,4.635983263598327
2651509,5,B000I2J6K0,"This video was in my regular rotation of exercise videos while I was pregnant.  I would not recommend this to a beginner but I would recommend it to someone who wanted to maintain pre-pregnancy fitness. Even though I was in decent shape before pregnancy, the first time I tried the workout I was quite surprised at how difficult it was - there are lots of squats!!  However, after a couple times it got easier.  I was able to get a good workout without over doing it.  I like that you only need the wall, your couch and a chair for this video.  You could use a yoga mat too, but most of the time I just did the floor exercises without one (I have carpet).  I did find this workout to be too much during my last month of pregnancy... I was having back pain and the workout did not help (nothing helped!!).  Still this was a great video to have and I always felt great when I was finished.",1253491200,,887,4.182352941176471

I was in good shape before I became pregnant, and still found this challenging enough. Now, I am in the first trimester of my second pregnancy, and I still love it. The workout is relaxed, and I don't feel out of breath at any point, but when I am finished, my muscles feel fatigued (in a good way). I also like that you can do the entire workout in your living room without any special equipment. I highly recommend this DVD!",1253404800,,518,4.463157894736842
2651511,5,B000I2J6K0,"OK.  So this is my fifth pregnancy and I have tried several pregnancy DVDs over the past 7 years.  For me this one far surpasses ALL of the others.  Here is my fitness background...I run four days a week, about 3 miles each time and follow that with a fifteen minute workout on a total gym (the Chuck Norris one).  I consider myself to be a very active stay at home mom with four young children.  I have managed to sustain an acceptable level of fitness and was able to complete this DVD upon my first attempt.  That doesn't mean I found it easy!  Far from it, but the competitive spirit within me drives me on!!

I was initially concerned that this workout wouldn't contain enough cardio, but Erin O'Brien doesn't let up for breaks (apart from the necessary bathroom ones!) and consequently I finished feeling quite challenged without being totally out of breath.  This is a complete body workout, so if you are not working out most of your muscle groups on a semi regular basis, you may want to start with the Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout..sadly it is 20 years old and a bit dated, but hey, if it gets you going and helps you tackle this DVD, a couple of weeks of dated workouts is worth it!

One criticism.  The partner workout with her husband is a little corny.  My husband would probably have a heart attack if I asked him to do it with me and while I don't have many inhibitions, this would be the limit of embarrassment.  I really don't see the need for this section, since Erin covers all muscle groups in the inidividual workout, which by the way my kids did with me!!

All in all, this is a no mess about pregnancy workout for women who are serious about maintaining their physical fitness while pregnant and if you have 40 minutes several times a week this is the one for you.",1250899200,,1789,4.381818181818182
2651512,5,B000I2J6K0,"I checked this dvd out from the library and would definitely buy it if I could get more use out of it than just the next four months (rather than just checking it out and renewing it repeatedly).

Erin O'Brien is completely likable, fun, AND she's pregnant, which I always appreciate when doing a prenatal workout.  It's great cardio + strength, but very safe.  Many other prenatal workouts I've tried are kind of slow and overly gentle, but when I do non-prenatal workouts I have to modify or skip a bunch of parts which is never very satisfying.  This one I could do everything, the instruction was excellent, the pacing perfect, plus Erin just makes things fun.

The workout length of 40 minutes I feel is perfect, and the warmup and cooldown/relaxation sections are among the best I've seen for any workout, prenatal or not--they really do their job and are a nice mix of core work and stretch of exactly what was worked.

The only part of this DVD I have to skip is the additional 20-minute partner workout, because not only would my partner not be willing to stand there and let me use him as a workout prop for 20 minutes, but I don't think I'd want him to.  Can't imagine many people would use it, but it's nice that it could include a partner anyhow.",1250380800,,1259,4.471615720524017
2651513,5,B000I2J6K0,"I am a male Personal Trainer that has a large clientele of females. Two of my clients became pregnant last year and they both asked me to keep training them throughout their pregnancy. I was a little apprehensive about that because of their condition. During their first trimester they both complained that I wasn't the same trainer, that I was being too easy on them. I was hesitant to push them like I did before. So I purchased Erin's DVD and watched it several times until I came up with a routine like hers. I appreciated the fact that Erin was about 9 months pregnant when she shot this DVD. They were both happy that it was challenging but not overly tough. I adjusted the intensity down as they got further along. I'm happy to say that one stayed with me for 8 months and the other for 7 months. Both babies' were healthy when they were born (however, one started crying when I held him and talked to him.  I think he recognized my voice from telling his mom to do one more rep).
I'm now using Erin's ""Postnatal exercise"" DVD and find it very informative for explaining to them that their body needs to go through rehab before we start the more intense exercises.  They both feel they are in better shape after these births than they were with their older children.
I would strongly recommend these DVD's to any expectant mother that wants to keep exercising through their pregnancy.",1249603200,21,1391,4.515873015873016
2651514,5,B000I2J6K0,"I absolutely love this prenatal fitness video. It is my favorite out of the many ones I've tried, and I do the 40 minute workout routine about 3 times a week. The best thing about it is that it is a *real cardio workout*. It is the only prenatal aerobics DVD that actually gets me sweating every time. I was quite athletic before I got pregnant, doing martial arts 2 times a week, high impact aerobics classes 2-3 times a week, and Pilates once a week. After I found I was expecting, several of those activities became unacceptable, and I had to look very hard to find a prenatal exercise video suitable for my fitness level. This DVD is it for me.

The 40 minute routine begins with an aerobic warm-up, then proceeds to about 20 minutes of dynamic, low-impact aerobic and strength moves that will get your heart pumping, energize your body, and work your muscles all at the same time. The routine includes several sets of squats, which will doubtless be helpful for me in delivery. After the aerobics section, exercisers proceed to floor moves to work the lower body and stretch.

The instructor is clearly experienced and has an easy-to-like personality which motivates me to keep going through the exercises. I love how the DVD is organized, with clear water breaks to make sure us pregnant ladies stay hydrated throughout the routine without having to stop the video. This is an amazing, safe, and challenging pregnancy workout and I would recommend it to anyone. I am greatly looking forward to trying the post-natal workout included in this set after I deliver.",1248998400,,1567,4.7153284671532845

I can't imagine keeping up with this workout further along in my pregnancy. Just the warmup alone had my heartrate going. It is very fast paced -- Erin calls it ""circuit training"" -- basically not giving you a chance to rest as you go from one exercise to the next. If you're a pro at aerobics, this is the DVD for you.",1248220800,2,431,4.204819277108434
2651516,2,B000I2J6K0,"What kind of DVD is this. it is way to rigorous for our pregnant bodies! Being pregnant is about staying healthy for you and your growing baby, not focusing on your weight and pant size. Those should be the last thing on your mind. As far a weight goes, try to stay with the guidelines of a weight gain of 25-35 pounds, and don't freak out if you a gain a little more! i feel that most of us, me included, chose to do these work out to keep up with the unrealistic standards of the media. It seems that a ton of these mom gaina massive amount of weight and then magically drop down to their old sizes with in months.  Look at Kate Hudson. It is reported that she gained way more than the recommended weight and she lost it all with three hour per day workout sessions. Starlets have trainers, nutritionists, and full time nannies to help them get red carpet ready. If you want some positive role models, look at Jennifer Garner and Jenny McCarthy. It took them over a year to loose the weight because they did it the healthy way. They were realistic and took their time. McCarthy credits weight Watchers as her key to success. This program helped me greatly with my post pregnancy weight loss. My complaints for this system... its too strenuous for our growing bodies, I hated the parts in which her Desperate Housewife star husband engages in the work out are a bit sexual, I felt I was watching a pregnancy guide to sex, and I thought it was hilarious when she was doing push ups, real push ups...are push ups going to get me ready for child birth?

But when I got pregnant, I started to feel like I was holding myself in the same position all the time - my body felt like it was getting older by the minute. (As if 37 wasn't old enough) I bought a yoga video, but couldn't take all the hippy-spiritual-""get in touch with your child"" stuff. I just wanted to feel like a human being. I got this video and loved it.

I did it 1-2 times a week from arond the 4th month till the week I had my daughter. I found it reinvigorated my entire body, helped with circulation (read: cankle control), kept me balanced and made me feel spry overall.

The workout is fast-paced, but it's doable (even for me, the non-exerciser), and though I ended up modifying a few of the moves in the end, I found it easier and better than walking - even just one mile of walking was harder for me and worked fewer muscles.

THE KICKER: I truly believe that my labor and delivery was easier and quicker because of the exercises in this video. All the squatting and pelvic floor exercises came back big-time when it counted. Sorry if this is TMI, but I only pushed for 20 minutes. I felt like my body was strong and prepared for what it needed to do...

I WILL be recommending this to anyone I know who gets pregnant. And, shocker, I actually have the urge to keep exercising. Not sure what's happening to me...",1243209600,,1408,4.321969696969697

I find this video the most enjoyable in terms of the instructor's personality.  It is easy to follow and provides a good workout.  I've been exercising regularly for three years and wanted to maintain a level of fitness during my third pregnancy.  This video provides a nice balance of light cardio, resistance moves and some pilates moves.  I feel like I have been comfortably challenged when I'm done...just what I  am looking for! I don't love the music or the camera angles, but I'm in it for the fitness, not to be a film critic.

I love that she reminds you to keep your abs engaged and I like the oblique work since you can't lay flat it is nice to work the abs in creative ways.  Some days that I do this, my lower body is more sore than when I do my non-prenatal dvd's using weights.  I think it must have to do with my form and the sequencing of the exercises and reps.

But once I found out I was pregnant, I needed a new exercise to stay healthy.  I found this and loved it!  She's talks about what you should and shouldn't do when and before working out, which was great being pregnant for the first time.  Also, has a workout with a partner which made my husband feel like he was more involved in the pregnancy.  The main exercise has a warm-up, workout and a cool down that lasts about 40 minutes and another 20 minutes with a partner.  I have recommended this to my sisters and friends that are pregnant.",1217376000,,680,4.349206349206349
2651560,5,B000I2J6K0,I have tried at least 20 different prenatal workouts and this is the first one that I actually found challenging (if you choose to make it challenging).  She workouts in her living room and uses furniture you would have in your living room so you don't need to buy any special equipment.  She is fun to workout with and not annoying like some of the other prenatal workouts I have tried.  This is my third pregnancy and I am glad I finally found a workout I want to stick with.  I would definitely purchase it again.,1217289600,,516,4.34375

It is a bit challenging but I don't know about anyone else but unless I feel like I am challenged at first I will definitely get bored down the road.  The partner workout is a bit of a waste if you ask me.  My husband is rarely home when I workout and if he was I am thinking this is not something he would like to do on a regular basis.  So in the 40 minute workout the warm-up is a bit fast paced.  Don't worry I made it no problem.  When I first did the workout I was worried that if this was the warm-up I wasn't going to make it through the rest.  The other constuctive criticism I would have is to maybe add some better music.  I tend to get in the mood if there is some good music but maybe that is not recommended because it might date the dvd.  Anyways, I highly recommend this dvd to anyone that would like to tone up there muscles and work up a good sweat- not too much but just the right amount of sweat if you know what I am saying.",1214524800,,1024,3.861244019138756

There is no fun or entertaining value to this workout, no jazzy or dancey moves. It's just Erin in her living room moving around. She is extremely well versed in prenatal fitness, and for people who just want to go through the motions and get it over with it will probably be an excellent workout. So, if you are looking for something fun and different... this workout is not for you. I've always needed a bit more motivation and dancing to keep me interested.",1212883200,,621,4.271186440677966

She is appears to have her husband recording the video in her living room. I also would have preferred a little more of a cardio aspect to the workout, this DVD tends to focus on more stationary exercises that help work the muscles but not necessarily get the heart-rate up. Overall it is worth doing if you have other DVD's to fall back on, because repeated use of this one would get dull pretty quick.",1212537600,,547,4.5353535353535355
2651591,5,B000I2J6K0,"I got this video because I was looking for one that had a shorter workout for the days where I couldn't fit in a whole hour.  I also was intriqued by the reviews for Erin O'Brien's workout.

Once you get past the cheesy ""You're Pregnant!"" montage at the beginning (and the pimping out of her husband James Denton of Desperate Housewives fame) you get to an incredibly intense workout.

O'Brien is very likeable with her makeup-free, low ponytail look.  She is wearing a simple gray tank and olive yoga pants with a couple of inches of her belly showing (yes, a video where the instructor herself is pregnant!).  The video takes place in her living room, she is free of fancy backdrops or fellow exercisers.  Occasionally the lighting changes to show her at silhouette so you can better see her form.  She isn't overly chipper and plastic, but feels like a real person, a friend or a personal trainer.

You will need a sturdy dining table chair that won't skid across the floor (for triceps dips), a coffee table, couch arm, and wall nearby.  A mat or towel is also required.  I don't have the non-skid chair so I repeat a different arm exercise.

I currently do yoga 3-4 times a week and walk 2-3 times a week.  I am still in my first trimester.  I found this to be a good workout - writing this the morning after yesterday's run with the video, I feel my muscles got a good workout - especially those in my legs.  The video was at a fast enough pace that I broke a sweat, but never was panting or overheated.  I must say, I kept thinking, ""if this woman who is in her third trimester can do it, I better be able to!""  O'Brien's laid-back personality and attitude also made me want to work with her, and not hate her (which I usually feel after a couple views of a workout video).

The video is broken into four sections, and are clearly explained.  Once in the exercises, you may for a second feel confused because of weird camera angles, poor sound when they are shooting her from above, or overly creative camera editing.  However these aren't terribly often or long and you can easily catch up and get the gist of what is taking place.  The music is subtle which is good because it's a bit annoying (up-tempo instrumental versions of nursery rhymes).

The studio is her living room, and it's not really large.  I too have a tiny living room, slippery wood floors and a lot of furniture and was able to do the entire routine in my little space in front of the TV with no issue.

O'Brien reminds you many times to drink water and pauses the exercise to drink herself.  She encourages you to take pee breaks when necessary, and offers alternate exercises if you are panting or feeling overheated.  She concentrates on those muscles that will be needed for delivery, but I feel as though I get an all-over great workout from this routine!",1212537600,,2838,4.453488372093023
2651592,5,B000I2J6K0,"I love to workout while I'm pregnant.  When I first bought this workout, I was only in my 3rd month.  My first impression was that it was too easy, and the format was totally different from my other non-pregnancy workouts.  However, as I moved into my 5th month of pregnancy, my usual workouts got a little more challenging than I felt was safe for me and the baby.  I pulled out Prenatal Fitness Fix and started doing it on a regular rotation with my other prenatal workout.  I've really started to tell a difference.  I've adjusted to Erin's style and now, I really enjoy it and I do the workout at least 3 times a week.  If you're a fairly fit individual I recommend this workout for your later months of pregnancy.

I am pregnant with my second child and am a physical therapist.  If I did not have a broad underatnding of precatutions that shoudl be taken not to damage my pelvis or low back during her numerous squats and one legged activities I would most likely have a significant injury that would cause me pain through the rest of my pregnancy.

I haven't been a very good exerciser during my pregnancy and got this hoping to get motivated again. I really enjoyed Erin ""realness"" (she stopped mid exercise and announced she had to pee) and the variety of the workout. I love that she combines typical aerobics class fare with ballet, pilates, yoga, etc. It was challenging but fun. And yes I am sore after all those squats!

Though the quality of the video has a very ""at home"" feel, Erin has a full workout with a quick pace that will keep you working. I didn't feel like it was too strenuous, and there is lots of time for stretching and relaxing.
The feel of the video is very laid back. Erin is in her home working out. There are many humorous moments, like when she has to go to the restroom in the middle of the workout. (It's also nice to have a pregnancy video led by someone pregnant.) I would recommend this video to anyone who wanted to stay in shape during their pregnancy.",1207612800,,680,4.27906976744186

I only wish the workout portion was a bit longer --- the main workout section is 40 minutes and that includes warm-up and cool down.  My recommendation is if you don't get all the moves the first time around, try again the next day and the next.  It gets easier and you WILL feel results.  Plus the more you play it, the more you can focus on other things she is saying besides just the movement of the exercise, such as what muscles you should truly be engaging, like the obliques for example.  If you're looking for something easy, there are plenty of other options out there.  This is challenging, but I wouldn't say difficult.",1207440000,,694,4.3828125

If you go at your own pace, it's fine, but following her speed (especially during the ""double-time"" parts) is probably too much for most women. You can tell she's a group exercise instructor--I'm sure she's a great teacher in that context. But I don't think the dismissive ""you're okay, you're fine"" comments she makes during the more intense parts of the video are necessarily the message to send to a pregnant woman who may be overexerting.",1206489600,7,663,4.627118644067797

I was pretty fit before getting pregnant (running marathons and biking) and ran up until the 5th month of my pregnancy.  Now I walk and do this video 3X a week and really feel like I've gotten a workout.  This video is great for anyone with a moderate to high fitness level.,1205798400,,449,4.247058823529412

The last part is stretch and relaxation, although i didn't find it very relaxing. If you are used to Yoga practice for stretching and relaxation, you'll probably want to skip this part as I did and just throw in the stretch and relaxation part of a pre-natal yoga video.

If I made a workout video this is exactly how  I'd do it.

Every week I walk & use elliptical twice and do yoga and I felt this video to be a very good workout. I couldn't keep up the first time around (8 months pregnant), but love that it will challenge me the next few weeks until the labor. It is great preparation with all the squatting too.

Now, while I am in decent shape, I am by no means in great shape - I can't remember the last time I was able to do a workout regularly...  I found that while my heart rate did occasionally increase, it quickly dropped again, and I found only a few of the excercises particularly challenging...

2651690,4,B000I2J6K0,"I bought this DVD after reading several of the reviews published on this site. I wanted a home workout DVD since winter was here and I knew I couldn't get out as much because of weather and demands of my current children.
Let me state that before I got pregnant, I was extremely physically fit and active. I exercise at a gym probably 5-6 times a week. I was able to run 4 miles a day and workout with weights. Once I got pregnant, I was able to keep up my physical activity, but once I hit 14-15 weeks pregnant, I could no longer run and I would get light headed when I was weight training, so I knew I needed to tone down the workouts. I walked outside from 16-21 weeks, but I started to get very severe round ligament pain in my abdomen as I got larger (this is my fourth pregnancy) and it would start up about 10 minutes into my walk, so walking was fast becoming a workout I could solely do for my exercise.

I searched and searched for pregnancy DVDs that would provide a workout challenge for me (so I could stay in shape), but didn't cause any pain or discomfort. Often, I would rent pregnancy workouts from mail/online DVD rental sites to test them out first. This DVD workout has become my new favorite type of exercise and so I bought the DVD since I do it several times a week. I don't get ANY round ligament pain (RL pain feels like severe cramps on the sides of your belly, but once you stop the physical activity, they go away). Erin's workout is challenging - in fact - I could not complete the whole DVD workout the first few times I did it - I could only finish 20 minutes of it or I would skip certain parts. Now, I can finish the whole thing and I don't get out of breath because she is really good at pacing and providing breaks - yet she keeps you up on your workout. You get some cardio - not a lot - but enough to get you sweating. You get a workout of squats, leg lunges, and kicks, but don't let that scare you away - they are completely doable for a pregnant woman and they make me feel really strong and able when I am done doing it. I enjoy the floor workout which consists of several Pilates-type leg lifts. There are some modified yoga stretches, but not a lot. All in all - if I do this workout 3-4 times a week, I really feel good physically because I got to workout, but I don't feel stress or strain on my body.

I will say that the video producation quality is more like a home video, but that doesn't bother me. She keeps it really simple - she herself is in a living room area of a house with the furniture cleared to the sides of the room, so it demonstrates that you don't need a lot of equipment or space to do this workout. The music is TERRIBLE so I just crank up my Ipod on my speakers and march to my own music.

The workout also contains a separate ""partner"" workout and she includes her hunky husband (Mike from Desperate Housewives). I just watched it for a few minutes and I found it cheesy, so I haven't actually done the workout - but it looks like a good supplement to the other workout if you want to adapt some of the moves.

Overall, this is a great home workout option - buy a separate yoga DVD for streching and stress relief, and try to get outside to walk, ride bikes, or swim and you have yourself a great balanced pregnancy workout program.",1198627200,26,3301,4.145085803432138
2651691,2,B000I2J6K0,"My wife thought this would be a useful video after viewing an interview with Erin and her husband on television.  I found this to be fast-paced and much more advanced than what we were expecting.  If you are a hard-core aerobics junkie then this must be designed for you--I am not pregnant and I found the pace painful to even watch; oh, and the partner portion of the video is perfect for those that need more than their own weight to use during aerobics. Erin's husband provides more resistance by leaning on top of his wife through the exercises, as if being pregnant was not enough.

I am sure Erin means well. However, for a normal person, you may need to watch the video at half-speed to keep up.  James Denton seemed as bewildered as I, but it was cool to see another puzzled husband accomodating his wife.

Also, she does it in a living room setting using a coffee table and couch as props.  It is very realistic and shows you, you can do this is a tight space.  Also has a great 20 minutes separate workout to do with your husband helping.  I like it becasue she changes routine just when you think you can't handle one more of the rep you are in.  She even pauses for pee breaks and water breaks.  I should add, I just had a baby 6 months ago and even though I lost all my weight, I am not in tip top shape and I was able to do the entire video.

Erin is positive but not perky or gushy about being pregnant.  She covers all the bases:  arms, back, legs, butt, thighs and abs.  None of the moves are complicated - some of them you'd recognize from buns of steel, some from pilates - and she switches them up during the workout so you don't get too bored doing one thing.  It's designed to be done in your home, so you do need a couch, a hard chair or coffee table, and a mat on hand (or carpet).  I really liked that she was no-nonsense and gives short breaks for water so you don't have to pause the DVD every time you need a drink.

I worked out about three times a week before getting pregnant, either running or doing cardio, so I was really looking for something that would make me feel like I was actually exercising.  This video is not difficult, keeps your heart rate below 140, but still makes you feel like you've done something productive.",1193097600,4,1113,4.342995169082125

2651721,4,B000I2J6K0,"I like this DVD cuz Erin is using resistant training without using any weight. I'm only in my first trimester, and all the horror stories I heard from the Moms and aunties, I was afraid to exercise like I used to. I stopped using weights in my exercise routine, and I just don't feel very good at all. Everything I do just doesn't feel like exercising anymore.

But Erin's exercise still keep my heart rate up, and the next day after the first time using this DVD, I felt the good-sore in my legs. I really enjoyed it.

Every movement is well-explained, and you can just utilize everything you have at home for the exercise. Simple to follow moves, and she does everything with you and counts for you.

The only thing about this DVD is that it doesn't seem like it's professionally made. It almost looks like she uses a home-camera, and without any professional lighting, she shot it at home. And there's no music. Or is there? Maybe very light music in the back. When I first viewed the DVD, I thought it was crappy production, but seriously, it doesn't affect anything. When you are exercising, you don't look at the screen much anyways.

Overall, I recommend this DVD.",1188950400,,1171,4.535545023696683
2651722,5,B000I2J6K0,"I have a few pregnancy workout video's but this is my favorite.  I feel like I actually get a good workout!  My legs and butt were sore the first couple of times after I did this video but I have no problems now!  Between this, walking outside, and some yoga on the side I feel like I'll have no problem getting back in shape after the baby!",1185235200,,341,4.059701492537314
2651723,5,B000I2J6K0,"I had a hard time trying to decide which pregnancy dvd's to purchase...but i've always been fitness savvy and wanted to stay fit during my first pregnancy. I was wary after reading some reviews of this one but I absolutely love it! It was challenging in my first trimester and it is still challenging now, in my 8th month. I don't do it every day, but I find it is a good thorough workout when I'm feeling like I've been sitting around too much (which is often!!). I also bought Shiva Rea's pregnancy yoga dvd and find that the two complement one another very nicely - good to alternate days with. Before pregnancy I was ""working out"" perhaps 2 days a week, by walking  , stretching, and doing light weights. But I feel like both of these dvd's are simply enough to follow for people of all fitness levels.",1184803200,,806,4.409395973154362
2651724,5,B000I2J6K0,"Of the prenatal workouts I've tried, this is definitely one of the better ones.  I'm sure I will use it a lot during this pregnancy.  Prior to my pregnancy, I worked out 6 days a week doing various activites.  I have done The Firm videos mostly for the past 1-1/2 years - but I would by no means consider myself an expert user of these videos.  I also actively walked and practiced yoga.  Just prior to finding out I was pregnant, I had begun to dabble in beginner kickboxing & pilates.  For my pregnancy, I am focused on maintaining my fitness level but I am discovering that I have to slow down a little (chalk it up to my age or that I currently chase 2 other children around).

Prenatal Fitness Fix definitely will be a great tool for this.  The workout takes place in Mrs. O'Brien's living room (or a well mimiced set).  She begins with an aerobic warmup and then moves into ""dynamic"" moves - push ups, squats, leg lifts, etc.  I thought I would find this a little slow given I'm used to the Firm videos, but Mrs. O'Brien moves through them quickly so it keeps your heart rate up.  It's tougher than it looks, but it was great!  Plus she utilizes items you have in your living room for the exercises - like push up leaning on the couch.  Great for those of us working out while our children nap or whatever.  She takes a few seconds between exercises to explain what is coming next.  This offers great cueing but also gives you plenty of opportunity to pause the video if needed (for a breather or bathroom break).

My only complaints about the video are the music and that she is alone for the workout.  The music is modified (mostly tempo, but in some other ways) nursery songs.  I feel I have to listen to nursery songs enough as it is with my children that I don't want to hear it during my time (my workouts).  I quickly learned to ignore it though and just pick up on the beat.  As far as her being alone for the workout - that is a personal preference of mine - I prefer an instructor interacting with other exercisers.

Overall, I would highly recommend this workout.  I felt like I actually got a workout instead of a half hour of simply moving (like most prenatal videos - please note this workout is 40 mins long).  I'm sure it will last with me through my second trimester at least.",1183593600,4,2299,4.3076923076923075
2651725,1,B000I2J6K0,"Ok, maybe I'm just not cut out for aerobics, but this was complicated!  Before getting pregnant I did the Power 90 DVD's (which I LOVE, but I was concerned the impact was too much with a baby). My biggest complaint is that she doesn't explain the moves.  She just jumps right into a routine, if you don't know it, she isn't gonna tell you!  The DVD has a homemade feel; taped in a`livng room, and a generic feel.  If you enjoy aerobics tapes and can keep up with constantly changing movements without instructions maybe you will like this, otherwise; might I suggest a treadmill or walk around the neighborhood in fresh air and the toning segment of Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy.",1182297600,7,687,4.560975609756097
2651726,5,B000I2J6K0,I consider myself an active person and was concerned about finding ways to exercise during pregnancy that would be challenging but not dangerous. I found the DVD to be at a great pace - a challenge but not too difficult. Erin narrates with a smile & humor without being annoying. I recommend this for someone looking for a good workout while pregnant.,1181520000,,351,4.67741935483871
2651727,5,B000I2J6K0,"I have absolutely no experience with childbirth, but I do know the presenter, Erin O'Brien, to be one of the most knowledgable, friendly and talented instructors on the Los Angeles fitness scene.  This is also a beautifully produced DVD that is quite evidently a safe and effective program for expectant parents.",1177804800,4,312,5.117647058823529
8143227,2,B000I2J6K0,"I like the workout, but the quality of this DVD is awful! It has skipped since the third time I've used it. Super annoying considering it's always been in my DVD player or the case. I don't think it's going to make it 11 more weeks until my due date.",1515628800,,250,4.02
8143228,4,B000I2J6K0,"My favorite pregnancy workout so far. I'm still in the first trimenster. The video is somewhat low budget and not easy, but is realistic. It's the perfect living room workout. I'm not in fantastic shape and was able to keep up pretty well. I only did the 40 minute workout, which had good variety and did not get dull. This will be my go to routine for a while.

Update: I was sore the following day. Maybe take it easy the first couple times and if you have hard floors, use a mat for the floor routine. A rug over hardwood didn't cut it. That is where I'm feeling it most. I still think it's a great workout. Good luck!",1485302400,3,621,4.175
8143229,5,B000I2J6K0,"Loved doing this workout while I was pregnant! Wasn't able to run once I got so far into my pregnancy, so this was just the challenge I needed.",1482710400,,143,4.142857142857143
8143230,5,B000I2J6K0,"Ok, I have seen some other moms who are regular workout gals saying this is not for the beginner. I would consider myself a beginner, and this workout is indeed tough. But, isn't that sort of the point of working out? If you're a beginner you won't breeze through; I sure as heck didn't. My jiggly bits jiggled a lot and I felt like a chunk trying to workout with her, especially with my big ole belly (baby #3--whoah---bump was instantaneous this time).
This will challenge you and definitely make you feel like a million bucks. Some of the camera angles are strange and the music is awful, but honestly, that's so minor.  The workout is a full workout. You will sweat and feel sore and want to yell (maybe that's just me because I hate working out... but I digress). She doesn't screw around letting you take forever to set up. It's a jump in and get busy type workout.

When I first started the workout I felt like crying because I couldn't keep up. But I hung in there and did what I could. I did modifications and slowed a bit. I ended the first day feeling amazing and so happy I stuck with it. I've done this a couple of weeks since then and can still say I enjoy it and feel really well.",1482105600,2,1195,4.259911894273127
8143231,3,B000I2J6K0,This workout is fairly challenging and I would only recommend it to women who have been working out regularly both before and during pregnancy. It definitely got my heart rate up and left me a bit red faced. Even the warm-up begins at a higher pace than most prenatal videos but she transitions to some slower paced mat work and ends with some gentle stretching to get your heartbrate back down. I really hated that they tried to get cute with the camera  during the first section. They would often cut out to an odd angle at an odd speed or black and white  mid exercise which can be confusing and disorienting. A few times it caused me to lose form and wrench my knee uncomfortably. Her cueing and form explanation  are decent but when she goes from a double count to a single count her speed is high enough that if you don't have good balance and core strength to start you'll struggle and could injure yourself if not careful. There's some cheesey music playing but she is not using it to pace and it seems to have been added later. The only exercise I could not do were the tricep dips due to an old shoulder injury. I also haven't done the second part that requires a partner. It looked effective and I like the idea but her husband looked about as enthused as mine would if I made him stand there bracing me through a 20 minute routine. They are not working out together nor is this a relaxing stretch routine geared toward bonding.  I think overall this is a good video for someone in good shape looking for a challenging routine to do throughout her pregnancy but if you aren't in great shape to begin with you should find something less advanced to start with.,1482105600,,1670,4.394822006472492
