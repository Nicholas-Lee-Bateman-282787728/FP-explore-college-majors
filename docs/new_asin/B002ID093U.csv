8370823,5,B002ID093U,"This review is for the six-disc, fifteen film Crime Boss Collection, as opposed to the 2-disc collection of the same name.

If you've read any of my reviews before, you know I always tout the Pop Flix collections as the best value for the money when compared against other companies that compile public domain films and package them in bundles.  I own several Pop Flix sets, several Mill Creek 12 and 50 packs, a few from TGC direct, and 2 sets from Video Asia.  I've run across a couple of duds, but for the most part, I've been happy with the price/value ratio of Pop Flix. Usually, it works out to about a dollar a film, and even though Mill Creek might be about 25 cents or less per film, they also have a lot of craptastic films that make that a poor choice for your two bits.

This collection, though, maybe the best overall choice I've seen yet from Pop Flix.  It's necessary for me to qualify that with two caveats: I really enjoy Eurocrime films from the seventies, and I thought the transfer and audio quality of the films were appropriate for the price.  These films have NOT been restored or cleaned up, like you might expect if you were buying a set from Raro Video or Wild East, and many of them were probably copied from a videocassette.  Scenes that take place at night are difficult to make out, and the aspect ratios are often not what was originally shot.  With that said, I still think this has been the most enjoyable collection I've seen yet.  Are all the films five-star?  No, not on a bet.  These films are mostly three and four star films (I didn't see any two stars), with MAYBE a five star or two thrown in, depending on how you feel about Eurocrime films from this period.

I'll give the technical aspects as well as I can, plus a rating for each film.  I often look at comments on my reviews, so if you have a specific question, ask it in the comments section below, and I'll answer as soon as I'm able.

Unfortunately, one of the confusing things about Pop Flix is the way they package their films.  This six-disc collection is made up of three 2-disc collections, one of which is also called 'Crime Boss'.  The other two are 'Mafia Kingpin' and 'Big Guns'.

From the Crime Boss disc 1:

CRIME BOSS: Directed by Alberto de Martino.  Starring Telly Savales and Antonio Sabato.  Three-and-a-half/Four stars.  Widescreen.  97 minutes and 38 seconds (IMDB lists 93 minutes)  Kid from the sticks breaks into big-city mob for the purpose of revenge

STREET LAW:  Directed by Enzo G. Castellari.  Starring Franco Nero and Barbara Bach.  Four Stars.  16 x 9.  101 minutes and 36 seconds (IMDB lists 105).  Nero gets taken hostage by bank robbers and seeks revenge.  Pretty good vigilante flick, though Nero takes so much abuse in the film, I'm surprised Mel Gibson hasn't remade it and starred in it.

REVOLVER aka BLOOD IN THE STREETS:  Directed by Sergio Sollima.  Starring Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi.  16 x 9.  109 minutes and 15 seconds (IMDB lists 111).  Four-and-a-half stars.  Reed's wife is kidnapped, and the kidnappers demand Reed, as prison warden, release Testi.  Most Eurocrime films are pretty shallow, but this is a bit more intellectual, probing ethical and moral questions.

Disc 2:

CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN:  Directed by Damiano Damiani.  Starring Franco Nero and Martin Balsam.  1.33:1.  101 minutes and 19 seconds (IMDB lists 101).  Despite the star power of Balsam (one of my favorite second bananas) and Nero, I always thought this flick was too slow.  Three/Three-and-a-half Stars

DEATH RAGE:  Directed by Antonio Margheriti.  Starring Yul Brynner and Martin Balsam.  1.33:1.  76 minutes and 21 seconds (IMDB lists 98 minutes).  Hit-man revenge flick.  Too bad this one is cut, would have been a Three-and-a-half/Four star film otherwise.

MAFIA KINGPIN disc 1:

MISTER SCARFACE aka RULERS OF THE CITY:  Directed by Fernando di Leo.  Starring Jack Palance, Al Cliver and Harry Baer.  1.33:1.  85 minutes and 59 seconds (IMDB list 85).  Revenge, sting film.  Three-and-a-half stars.

THE COP IN BLUE JEANS: Directed by Bruno Corbucci.  Starring Jack Palance and Tomas Milian.  1.33:1.  91 minutes and 23 seconds (IMDB list 95 minutes).  Milian's undercover cop is a big Serpico fan, and is out to get Palance.  Three stars

Disc 2:

THE CYNIC, THE RAT, AND THE FIST: Directed by Umberto Lenzi.  Starring Maurizio Merli, John Saxon and Tomas Milian.  Widescreen.  94 minutes and 59 seconds (IMDB lists 100 minutes).  Former policeman Tanzi is on the run from a man (Milian) he sent to prison.  Three/Three-and-a-half stars.

THE MASTER TOUCH: Directed by Michele Lupo.  Starring Kirk Douglas and Giuliano Gemma.  16 x 9.  95 minutes and 58 seconds (IMDB lists 112).  Safecracker Douglas has one final score to make and then retirement.  Off the hook chase scene.  Four stars.

VIOLENT NAPLES: Directed by Umberto Lenzi.  Merli and Saxon again.  Widescreen.  90 minutes and 35 seconds (IMDB lists 95 minutes).  Merli (Commissioner Betti) is after gangster Saxon, no matter what the cost.  Unbelievable motorcycle race through the streets of Naples.  Three-and-a-half stars

From BIG GUNS, disc 1:

BIG GUNS aka NO WAY OUT: Directed by Duccio Tessari.  Starring Alain Delon and Richard Conte.  16 x 9.  104 minutes and 16 seconds (IMDB lists 90 minutes).  Delon is a hit man and wants out.  When the mob puts a hit out on him, Delon's wife and child are killed by mistake.  Four stars.

VIOLENT PROFESSIONALS: Directed by Sergio Martino.  Starring Luc Merenda and Richard Conte.  Widescreen.  99 minutes and 36 seconds (IMDB lists 104 minutes).  Merenda goes undercover to find out who killed his boss.  Four/ Four-and-a-half stars.

LONG ARM OF THE GODFATHER: Directed by Nardo Bonomi.  Starring Peter Lee Lawrence and Erika Blanc.  Widescreen.  84 minutes and 33 seconds (IMDB lists 86 minutes).  Lawrence tries to steal from his boss, the Godfather.  Three-and-a-half/Four stars.

Disc 2:

MAGNUM COP: Directed by Stelvio Massi.  Starring Joan Collins, Maurizio Merli and Gastone Moschin.  133:1.  85 minutes and 16 seconds (IMDB lists 93 minutes)  Private Eye Merli is hired to find a missing millionaire's daughter.  Four stars.

EMERGENCY SQUAD: Directed by Stelvio Massi.  Starring Tomas Milian and Gastone Moschin.  Widescreen.  90 minutes and 8 seconds (IMDB lists 95 minutes).  Interpol inspector Milian is after the man who shot and killed his wife years before.  Four stars.

Unfortunately, if you believe IMDB, most of these films are cut, though the only one that seemed obvious to me was EMERGENCY SQUAD.  For the most part, I found almost all of these films enjoyable, though if you are looking for happy endings, they are few and far between in these types of movies.  There is also a lot of violence, and I think every one of these flicks has at least one episode where a woman character gets slapped or beaten.  If you find that intolerable in any context, then these are not films for you.  Otherwise, if you know the type of film you are getting into, and unless one wanted to spend a lot more money for the handful of these films that are available from specialty houses like Raro Video and Wild East, then this is an excellent way to see some films that aren't easy to find.",1415232000,5,7248,4.790243902439024

8370825,5,B002ID093U,"The picture quality on this films are fair to good, the content of the movies are mostly great. I haven't seen Crime Boss, but the other four films are all excellent. Their Italian made Grindhouse classics, with REVOLVER being the best all around movie, a ruthless revenge saga starring the great Oliver Reed and the underated Fabio Testi. Street Law has Franco Nero in a kick-ass Charlie Bronson-type role. Nero is back in the above average genre fair of CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN. Finally, we get DEATH RAGE, Oscar winner Yul Brynner's final film, not a great film, but thoroully enjoyable none the less. For fans of 70's explotiation action picks, you know when men were unashamed to be macho, then this set is one not to let pass you buy.",1274918400,10,748,4.674242424242424
