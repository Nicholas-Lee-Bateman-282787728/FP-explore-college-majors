I was in that video and I always thought that people wouldn't ""get it""; as you said. When I did this, it was not about making ""porn"" or anything. It was exactly as you said,...to be interpreted by men or women in their own way. To watch for the men & their bodies, or to watch and learn Yoga basics. Whichever anyone chooses is strictly up to them.

As one of the participants, I can assure you that all three of us did this as a ""modeling"" gig with a Yoga flair; not to trick people into buying a misleading ""porno"" film.

Thank you for the kind words.

Sincerely,

George Harris Jr.",1149465600,,652,4.2682926829268295

8005758,2,B00012QKWY,I am very disappointed with this purchase. I knew it would be more of an erotic video that an actual instructional video when I ordered it. 10 minutes into my first viewing I realized the only value this DVD has is of an erotic purpose. Totally useless for yoga. If you want an actual instructional video look elsewhere.,1121731200,8,320,4.5344827586206895
8005759,4,B00012QKWY,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this the first time around--these guys are amazingly gorgeous. On my second viewing, i found myself still unable to take my eyes off of them. These men are hypnotic! Mesmerizing... it's simply a great viewing pleasure, if nothing else!",1115942400,2,265,5.186046511627907
8005760,1,B00012QKWY,"I purchase many yoga tapes and DVDs, and can usually find something of value in all of them. This particular DVD, however, found me challenged to list anything it had going for it -- other than the very good looking male yogis. Still, once you get beyond the buff bods and glistening sweat, there is absolutely no substance to this DVD. If Amazon allowed you to return DVDs after opening them, I'd definitely be returning this one. It is brief beyond belief, with nothing new -- no interesting posture variations, no instructions beyond the most rudimentary and no reason to add it to your collection. A wiser purchase would be ""Better Sex Through Yoga for Gay Men."" It provides a good workout, with yogis that may not be as good looking but inspire you nevertheless.",1097971200,23,767,4.688888888888889
