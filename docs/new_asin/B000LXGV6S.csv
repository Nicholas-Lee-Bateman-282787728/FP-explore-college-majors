8540654,1,B000LXGV6S,This DVD was awful.  They didn't even spell Bob Griese's name right on the cover of the DVD.  The DVD itself was like one that someone made at home really quick on their computer.  They don't even go back that far into Purdue's history to find great players.  They got some of the positions wrong for the players they did have.  It was a Christmas gift but one for a White Elephant party where you could have gifts.  Thank God...  I would have been so embarrassed otherwise.  The only reason I gave it one star is because it actually came.,1197849600,2,539,4.32
