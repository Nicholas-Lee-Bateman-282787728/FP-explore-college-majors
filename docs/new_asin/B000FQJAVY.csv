8598279,5,B000FQJAVY,"This DVD has saved my Saltwater Aquarium.  Asking store owners and others that have an aquarium just wasn't quite enough.  But this DVD taught me what I needed to do to keep not only my corals alive but how to get my entire aquarium thriving.  The best part is I can watch it again and again for a refresher.  Carson Passey explains everything in lamens terms, he knows what he is talking about.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in taking their saltwater aquarium to the next level.",1164672000,9,501,4.522222222222222
