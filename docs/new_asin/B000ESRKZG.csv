8162945,4,B000ESRKZG,"This is a pirate/bootleg edition of Paul McCartney 1997 album Flaming Pie.  Despite good reviews from the pros, this is another album that gets overlooked.  This came off the heels of the Beatles Anthology so it was time to start from scratch.  Sadly this is the last studio album he did with first wife Linda as she had passed on in April 1998 from breast cancer.  Her health may be the reason why this album had no tour, the first all-original studio release not taken on the road since Press to Play over a decade previously.  The bonus tracks and disc could be a prediction of what the official remaster could contain though it might not happen for quite some time as better known albums return to the shops.  The bonus DVD was released separately as In the World Tonight.  Until the real thing comes along this will do.",1371513600,2,824,4.489932885906041
