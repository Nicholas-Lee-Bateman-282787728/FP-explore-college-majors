8085735,2,B000BF0CO8,"These DVDs' claim to be ""entertainment"", but because of the important topics they are attempting to show and/or explain they could endeavor to be a lot more accurate, realistic, scriptually informative and reasonably inspired. What can I say? When a source (A&E) is NOT  Christian (Holy Spirit inspired) as the prophets most certainly were, how can we expect to get an accurate look?  Sorry............. faith is nowhere to be found.",1382745600,,433,5.171428571428572
8085736,5,B000BF0CO8,I thought I knew the bible only for A&E to prove me wrong-this is very informative. I recommend it because it tells you all you need to know about prophets.,1364169600,,156,4.233333333333333
8085737,5,B000BF0CO8,I'm so glad I located this!  If you were a fan you will enjoy it also.  Full of infomation and presentation was great also.,1363824000,,123,4.083333333333333
8085738,1,B000BF0CO8,"No book, either the Bible or even The Urantia Book that I am a student of, can ever take the place of one's personal experiences involving the spiritual reality of God. This same concept applies to movies as well. So my faith in God was not altered one way or the other when a little over a minute into this episode about Prophets, they show (for three to four seconds) the back side of a naked man walking down a dirt road as the narrator tells us about Isaiah walking naked through the streets of Jerusalem for three years. But my faith in the producers of this show headed in a negative direction from this point on (that is to say that I tuned out even though I tried to watch the rest and listen with an open mind). It's not that I am particularly offended by nudity since from what I've been told, that's what I was wearing when I came into this world...absolutely nothing. And if the show was about how to join a Mesopotamian nudist colony or how to get an even suntan all over or perhaps even how to get arrested before you even have a chance to get an even suntan all over, then I would not have been so surprised by what seems to me to have been a poor choice of visual imagery considering the subject matter. But I did assume that a documentary produced by A & E TV about the Mysteries of the Bible would be a family-friendly production suitable for all ages of viewers especially when it is rated TV-G. Apparently, my assumption was invalid. Perhaps Coppertone was one of their sponsors when this first aired on March 17, 1995.",1331251200,2,1539,4.310344827586207
8085739,3,B000BF0CO8,"I bought this title in expectation of some explanations of the ancient Bible prophecies. Nowhere in this collection are there any mention of Daniel's prophecies concerning the 70 weeks or any attempted explanations of Ezekiels 430 days. While there are different attitudes and interpretations concerning these visions, i would think they would deserve being highlighted as one of the reasons these prophets were called prophets. Prophets working themselves into a frenzy, cannot be proven. A rather unflattering impression. Isaiah walked around naked for 3 years. Okay, that's a Bible fact. But what about all of his prophecies concerning the coming Messiah, that proved accurate? Oh well. As i said earlier, you can buy it for the enterainment value, but don't be misled or taken into someone elses opinion.",1256342400,3,808,5.3203125
8085740,3,B000BF0CO8,"Well, after all this video was produced by Arts and....Entertainment.

And after all, it is designed for mass consumption.  It is about what one

would expect.  Some truths.  Some extra Biblical speculation presented

as fact, and some flat out misleading information.

For example: One prophet is

pictured literally eating a scroll here on earth, when in reality the experience

was part of a visionary, Heavenly experirence.  One ""Professor of Old Testament

History"", apparently because Saul met some praise singers and dancers before

a spirit of prophecy came on him, and because one prophet asked for harp

music before making a Divine proclamation, states that the prophets

""worked themselves into frenzies"" before they heard from YHWH and suggested

that they became like ""whirling dervishes.""  Sad. So much for the ""still

small voice"" of the Father that the prophets actually, generally, heard.

In another place in the video an opinion is presented that the vision

of the fiery chariot might be a UFO, and of coures no attempt is made

to explain that this would be based on nothing in Scriptures.

Nevertheless the video gives an interesting panormaic view of prophecy

which can lead to some valuable reflection.  The problem is, if you

aren't very familiar with Scriptures, you could be very deceived by the

inaccuracies presented side by side with the truth.",1172275200,10,1378,5.126696832579186
8085741,2,B000BF0CO8,I did't like the content or the way it was presented. Very superficial.  Not good for scholars.,1130112000,,95,4.588235294117647
