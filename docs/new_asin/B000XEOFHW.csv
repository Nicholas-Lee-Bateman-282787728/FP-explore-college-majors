3002205,5,B000XEOFHW,"my son is almost 4 and we saw part of this video on you tube. After buying it, he watches it a lot and knows all the songs. He likes to have the exact trucks to play with at the time the song comes on and he recreates what the truck is doing. The songs are well written and catchy and not nearly as annoying as some other kid song products.",1305763200,,340,3.8028169014084505
3002206,5,B000XEOFHW,"Bought this as a gift as I knew my friend's son was in love with the excavator song they posted on youtube - and he loves the whole dvd!  Hilarious songs, and it's a learning tool too, he now knows the names of trucks/machines that I didn't even know!",1297123200,,251,4.122448979591836
3002207,5,B000XEOFHW,"My two year old son LOVES this movie. He wakes up before dawn asking for the ""truck movie."" Even his 6 year old sister likes it. The songs are very catchy and get stuck in my head. I highly recommend it for any little boy!",1290211200,,222,3.9555555555555557
3002208,5,B000XEOFHW,"I'm not often inspired to write reviews of items I buy, but I am for this DVD.  My two year old has never been interested in watching shows of any kind. I was happy with that. But when I came down with a throat infection while my husband was away on a business trip I was desperate to distract him.  He loves construction equipment, so I bought 4 different construction videos from Amazon with Prime shipping to get them here faster.  None of the other videos held his attention for more than 5 minutes. This DVD, however, saved my sanity. It combines his two favorite things--music and trucks--and he just loves it. Often the first words out of his mouth in the morning are ""Truck Tunes"".  Plus, the songs are not only catchy, they're educational! Even my non-truck-obsessed 4 year old likes it. You certainly can't go wrong buying this DVD for your truck lover.",1289088000,,863,4.548387096774194
3002209,5,B000XEOFHW,"I have never written a review on amazon before but...
I bought this last week.  My 2 1/2 year old son absolutely loves it!  He already knows most of the songs and delights in naming all the trucks we see on the road now.
I highly recommend this DVD for any young child who likes trucks.  But be warned, some of these songs are pretty catchy.  You may find yourself humming ""they call him bulldozer"" all day long :)",1275350400,,414,4.2025316455696204
3002210,5,B000XEOFHW,"This is a great DVD for young kids (30 months +) that shows ten different construction equipment 'trucks' in action but explained with original songs.

The songs make this more fun than just watching the equipment.  (Beware parents, you may end up with some of these songs running in your head, as they are a bit catchy.)

The songs are narrative ballads that explain what the equipment does, and sometimes some important details about its parts.  The music style for the songs alternates between 20th century electronic rock opera to country style folk songs with acoustic instruments.  Kids love it, and I can kind of see why, because it's a lot more fun than just an educational documentary naration.
But it is very educational because -- they pay attention, and the narration within the songs explains the functions of the equipment in great detail.  Hard to explain how the song writer does this, but it's good music about construction equipment, for kids.

The songs are about ten types of equipment (called 'trucks') excavator backhoe, front end loader, scraper, road grader, bulldozer, loader backhoe, forklift, impact hammer, feller-buncher, and log delimber.

Many of the scenes appear to be from Arizona construction sites.",1260835200,,1234,5.104477611940299

3002213,5,B000XEOFHW,"This is an awesome video. My son is glued to the tv when he watches it. It's great when I need to clean the house without any distractions. I actually seen it when my mother-in-law played it at her house. Then, I had to order one for myself. The songs are catchy and even us grown-ups will learn what the name of each truck is. I had no idea what an excavator was before I've seen this. I think I'm going to purchase the CD next! This is a great DVD to get!",1209340800,5,457,3.924731182795699
3002214,5,B000XEOFHW,"It's not often that a DVD is this much of a hit with my 3 year old and 1 year old boys.  They watch Truck Tunes at least 3 times a day and would it would probably be on 24/7 if I allowed it!

The songs are very unique and catchy (they love Forklift Boggie and Feller Buncher)  My boys use imaginary microphones to sing along and dance to the music.  Sometimes they sit transfixed watching every detail.

It's obvious that the makers of this DVD put a lot of thought and hard work into the creation.  Their first DVD ""Twenty Trucks"" is also a huge hit with my sons.  We waited with baited breath while Truck Tunes was in the making and would not hesitate whatsoever to purchase whatever else they make!

I highly reccomended this for all kids and adults alike!  My husband loves this DVD as well!",1201478400,12,795,4.246666666666667

Only drawback is some are a little too catchy: I end up singing them to myself at work and looking like a weirdo.,1456617600,,272,4.625
3002223,5,B000XEOFHW,My nephew loves this and watches it repeatedly on youtube.  The songs are obviouly chessy but oddly appealing and catchy.  Even us adults find ourselves humming the songs and I even see different trucks around now and know all this stuff about them because I watch along with the kids.

3002249,4,B000XEOFHW,My son LOVES the DVD but it doesn't play well on our DVD player in the car.  I guess the sound quality isn't good enough for our FM stereo sound from the DVD player.  It did work fine in our DVD playing in the house.,1410307200,,216,3.7777777777777777

He can not get enough of it.  We will watch, point to the trucks, and dance along to at least 5 songs before taking  a break.  It is the first thing on the tv that has been able to keep his attention.  He gets so excited now when we turn on the tv because he expects to see his diggers.

We bought this because we had seen a few of their samples on youtube, and my son loved them.  I am very happy with the purchase, as is our son.  He can watch the songs straight through, and its nice that they try to teach some info about the different types of trucks.  I find myself humming along sometimes as well  :)",1397433600,,424,4.0

 I rented it from the library before buying it and there was a male voice as the narrator of the video, telling facts about each truck. When I got my copy 12/13, it was exactly the same video but with two females that ask each other questions, make connections, and seem to be more educational geared. I personally liked the male voice better, however the newer 2 females speak with toddlers as their audience. My son loved them both!!!

The song WILL get into your head! Lol!",1389657600,,595,4.4

After a few weeks of YouTube watching we got our first dvd. We're not the most gentle of families so 3dvds later I decided not to buy another. We were all elated to see the dvd was now available for streaming so we could neither scratch the hard copy our simple lose it. I actually had been watching for it for weeks and bought it the day Amazon put it on streaming.

In addition, it is educational so not only do I have to hear the DVD I get to hear about every machine my sons see on the road and what they do! haha.",1374105600,,434,3.769230769230769

He's with me 5 days per week so I've seen it approximately 1,000,000 times already (or so it seems).  It's well done with a different song for each piece of machinery which I appreciate.  The singer has a good voice so it's not too annoying - even after the 5th time seeing/hearing it in one day.  Wish the songs that get stuck in my head didn't start with ""they call him bulldozer, or dozer for short"", but in all seriousness your little big machinery lover will really enjoy this one!",1363392000,,640,4.628318584070796

We watched some of these songs on YouTube, over and over, for about 6 months, and he kept requesting them. So we bought the complete collection, and I was pleasantly surprised that he actually liked the new ones even more than the ones on YouTube.  In my opinion, it is worth buying this video, even though you can watch many of them on YouTube.  Of my kids' 4 favorites, 3 are not on YouTube.  Also, the base on the video is awesome, nothing like the YouTube versions.  The tunes are REALLY cool, and I say this as an adult.  Catchy.

My 22 month old toddler finds it fascinating.

However, there was a surprising bonus: for some mysterious reasons, it seems to make my child want to eat. While he is watching this, he just chows down. It's like he goes into a trance and will eat anything you put in/near his mouth.",1339545600,,442,4.582278481012659

3236705,5,B000XEOFHW,"I'm not often inspired to write reviews of items I buy, but I am for this DVD.  My two year old has never been interested in watching shows of any kind. I was happy with that. But when I came down with a throat infection while my husband was away on a business trip I was desperate to distract him.  He loves construction equipment, so I bought 4 different construction videos from Amazon with Prime shipping to get them here faster.  None of the other videos held his attention for more than 5 minutes. This DVD, however, saved my sanity. It combines his two favorite things--music and trucks--and he just loves it. Often the first words out of his mouth in the morning are ""Truck Tunes"".  Plus, the songs are not only catchy, they're educational! Even my non-truck-obsessed 4 year old likes it. You certainly can't go wrong buying this DVD for your truck lover.",1289088000,,863,4.548387096774194

I bought this last week.  My 2 1/2 year old son absolutely loves it!  He already knows most of the songs and delights in naming all the trucks we see on the road now.
I highly recommend this DVD for any young child who likes trucks.  But be warned, some of these songs are pretty catchy.  You may find yourself humming ""they call him bulldozer"" all day long :)",1275350400,,414,4.2025316455696204
3236707,5,B000XEOFHW,"This is a great DVD for young kids (30 months +) that shows ten different construction equipment 'trucks' in action but explained with original songs.

The songs make this more fun than just watching the equipment.  (Beware parents, you may end up with some of these songs running in your head, as they are a bit catchy.)

The songs are narrative ballads that explain what the equipment does, and sometimes some important details about its parts.  The music style for the songs alternates between 20th century electronic rock opera to country style folk songs with acoustic instruments.  Kids love it, and I can kind of see why, because it's a lot more fun than just an educational documentary naration.
But it is very educational because -- they pay attention, and the narration within the songs explains the functions of the equipment in great detail.  Hard to explain how the song writer does this, but it's good music about construction equipment, for kids.

The songs are about ten types of equipment (called 'trucks') excavator backhoe, front end loader, scraper, road grader, bulldozer, loader backhoe, forklift, impact hammer, feller-buncher, and log delimber.

Many of the scenes appear to be from Arizona construction sites.",1260835200,,1234,5.104477611940299

The songs are very unique and catchy (they love Forklift Boggie and Feller Buncher)  My boys use imaginary microphones to sing along and dance to the music.  Sometimes they sit transfixed watching every detail.

It's obvious that the makers of this DVD put a lot of thought and hard work into the creation.  Their first DVD ""Twenty Trucks"" is also a huge hit with my sons.
