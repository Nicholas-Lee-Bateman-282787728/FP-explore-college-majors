I had never painted crystal and the instructions were so clear that my painting has such a realism to it. I attended some watercolor workshops from her over the years and have gained a much better understanding of color and shadows.  I find her to be a fun and amazing instructor. I read where she was coming to teach a workshop in my area so without finding out the subject (I assumed it would be flowers) I signed up. Imagine my surprise when I arrived at the class to find it was on painting people and there were two models for us to paint over the two day workshop. This was something I have never attempted and did not have much interest in doing, but what the heck, I was there and had paid for the class.  The first day was a disaster for me.  It was fun but my picture turned out terrible. After the class the model walked around the room looking at peoples work and when she got to mine she just frowned and walked away.  I keep it hanging in my studio and get lots of laughs over it. The second day was much better and I really started to enjoy what we were doing. The model was an American Indian dressed in bright attire and it turned out much better. I still like doing landscapes and flowers better though.  I would highly recommend this video and her books.",1234828800,,1441,4.225454545454546
