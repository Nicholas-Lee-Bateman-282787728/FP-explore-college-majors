935640,1,6304872402,"I don't remember seeing a more predictable and repulsive movie in my entire life. The whole story seems to be made up of the most common elements of a typical kid's cartoon, compiled together to make a uniformily  miserable cinematic experience. The caricatural representations of Russia  and France are downright distasteful and offensive. The use of an  ultimately tragic subject matter and melodramatic soundtrack is a  dishonorable use of people's emotions. There is really nothing going for  this pathetic excuse of a movie, and even a brief glimpse of it should be  avoided at all cost.",912816000,6,592,5.114583333333333
935641,5,6304872402,"""Anastasia"" is the most Beautiful, Uplifting, and Meaningful movie I have ever seen! (It left me completely enchanted the first time I saw it in the theatre, and I ended up seeing it a total of 15 times while  it was in the theatres because I LOVE it so much! Needless to say, I now  own the video). The storyline of how the endearing characters find the true  meaning of Home, Love, and Family brings a sense of inspiration and comfort  to everybody who watches it, no matter what age you are. The songs are  lovely, the backgrounds are breathtaking, and the content of the movie  stunningly reflects joy for life, joy for finding out who you are, and joy  for finding true love.",912297600,,680,4.435483870967742
935642,2,6304872402,"An unbalanced movie. Excellent score and story, good secondary characters,  impressive but impersonal computer generated backgrounds, poor villain  (including the white bat) and an antipathic heroine. The excessive use of  computer generated textures gave an artificial look for the movie. A  doubtful movie: it's a animated feature but looks like a full computer  generated movie. After all, it's a good work, but no more than it.  END",908064000,,436,5.432835820895522

935718,5,6304872402,"Pros:
A great Disney-like animated musical. If you didn't know better you would think they created it.
Fantastically fleshed-out story, with a street-wise and beautiful heroine, cocky yet loveable love interest, fantastic bad guy, and amazing side characters.
The musical numbers are catchy and performed brilliantly by professional singers whose voices match our leads.  Our side characters actually do their own singing.
The animation is way better looking than the artwork for the DVD cover, which is horrendous by the way.
The voice acting is stellar!
Its a film geared toward the entire family, but will most likely appeal to girls (young and old).
Its one of those films you can watch over and over again.
It is featured both in widescreen or Pan-scan setting.  You must watch it in widescreen. The animation is so brilliantly drawn in exquisite details from that era.

Cons:
Wished it was longer, it was sooo good.",1509235200,,921,5.046052631578948

935763,5,6304872402,"Despite being produced by 20th Century Fox, there are a TON of people who think this is a Disney movie, which speaks to the quality of this animated musical. Anastasia is one of my absolute favorite animated movies! Growing up, she was my favorite princess, even though she isn't Disney. The animation is beautiful, the characters are great, the music is AMAZING. I might be biased due to nostalgic reasons, but I've also never met anyone who has anything negative to say about this movie. I still watch it as an adult with just as much joy as when I was a child. In fact, my friends and I just watched this a few days ago and had a lot of fun with it. I would imagine that children would still find joy in this film today, though I have none to speak on behalf of, personally.

Obviously, this is not a historically accurate movie. If you can live with that, then I promise it's a really great story! And if you can't live with that, then you are SUPER DUPER missing out.

I purchased this blu-ray to replace my old VHS -- I know, I know, what is this ancient technology I speak of! I also have a digital copy, which has been my main means of watching for the last few years, but I just really wanted another physical copy. I was really happy to find that a blu-ray version existed. And for the price, I couldn't pass up bringing this awesome movie from my past home!",1506470400,,1368,4.277992277992278

935811,5,6304872402,"Anyone who has studied the Russian revolution and the Romanovs in detail ( I have) will of course not endorse this movie as historical fact. But this movie's purpose is not to dramatize actual events. It is a story in itself, the magical legend of the lost Princess Anastasia. Fantasy and reality blur together here. I liked this version better than the Ingrid Bergman movie which had too much dated psychoanalysis in it. Rasputin was a bit overdone and his scenes might be too dark for little kids. Otherwise this is an excellent movie for kids and may encourage interest in history later on. The songs are good and the love story beautiful.",1496707200,,642,4.6902654867256635

This movie manages to be romantic, while also showing Anya as a strong and radiant woman, showing Dimitri and his wonderful character development, and being about a grandmother and her granddaughter. It will forever be one of my favorite movies with the best soundtrack ever.

My only issue is the music on the DVD tends to be too loud while the dialogue is too soft.",1491696000,4,618,4.54054054054054
935905,5,6304872402,"I originally owned this film in the late 90s, on VHS. While I was repurchasing Disney films, I came to a fork in the road. There was one film from my childhood that was not a Disney film that I still enjoyed as much as I did back when I was a kid, and that was Anastasia from Don Bluth.

Don Bluth originally worked for Disney, but left to form his own studio. Many know him for ""An American Tail,"" and ""The Secret of NIMH,"" but over time Bluth decided to make a film that was almost on par with what Disney had made, and that was Anastasia. The story takes place in Russia, where the young Anastasia is separated from her family. Believed to be dead, Anastasia has amnesia and lives as an orphan up until she is a teenager (or what we can assume is a young adult), and then discovers that she may have a past that includes what she's always been searching for: her family.

The story is not historically accurate, but is a ""Disney-fied"" version. I enjoy it, nonetheless, as a story that ages well over the years. I am 27 years old, and still enjoy it as much as I did as a child. I can't say that for every cartoon flick I watched as a kid, but mostly the ones that stand the test of time are Disney...with the exception to some films done by Don Bluth.

I recommend this film for anyone that enjoys the story, and even is discovering the movie for the first time. Although it's not as strong as a Disney movie, it still emulates the same story that most Disney stories do, with catchy songs and a great story to tell.",1490918400,,1519,4.177474402730375

935907,5,6304872402,"I have been in love with ""Anastasia""  since early childhood, and credit it (along with several other films) with nurturing a lifelong passion for musicals. I won't go into detail about the epic story, witty script, great songs, grand score, sparkling vocal performances, or superb animation, but I do want to comment on how phenomenal it looks and sounds on Blu-ray.

I have seen this film hundreds of times since its release on VHS and DVD and thought I knew every line by heart, yet watching it on Blu-ray, there were lines of dialogue, musical cues, and sound effects that I had either never heard or were incomprehensible before. As far as the visuals, the picture has never looked better. Not only is it presented in the original widescreen theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, the distracting graininess that was visible in the earlier releases is completely gone, and everything looks bright and clear. Like the improved audio, I found myself noticing little subtleties in the animation that weren't as easily visible before.  All together, the entire filmic experience is enhanced in a way that makes it like watching a brand-new film instead of one that is twenty years old. I highly recommend this release!",1489276800,,1214,4.9411764705882355

936108,5,6304872402,"Growing up with all things Disney - literally, I owned just about every Disney VHS released as a kid - for some reason, this non-Disney movie really stood out for me above all others. There's something about the cast of characters that continues to enamour even the now adult me; from the beauty, grace, and personality of Anastasia, to the mischievous, yet caring, handsome Dimitri, their story arc continues to enchant me. Anastasia's quest to find her family is heartwarming and humorous, the songs memorable, and the scenery animation breathtaking.

What I remember most about this enchanting film are the songs ""Journey to the Past"" and ""Once Upon a December"". Decades later, I sometimes find myself humming the beautiful melodies or the songs simply getting stuck in my head. I've watched this DVD so many times over the years (I purchased it after we switched from VHS to DVD), and I fully intend to pass this down to my own children one day.

936416,3,6304872402,"I'm going to be flat-out honest here -- I'm not a big fan of Don Bluth's movies.  While I applaud him for trying to make a name for himself outside of the Disney empire, his movies are often grim and strange, and I'm not a fan of his animation style (character designs are grotesque, gestures and body language -- especially mouth movements -- are overly exaggerated, etc.).  I can appreciate that he believes kids are capable of handling darker plots than most animated films give them credit for, but this often means that it feels like his movies are dark for darkness' sake.  And let's face it, many of his newer films are just flat-out WEIRD, from ""The Pebble and the Penguin"" to ""A Troll in Central Park"" to the unholy mess that is ""Rock-A-Doodle.""

Okay, rant over...

All that said, I dare say that ""Anastasia"" is one of Bluth's better films.  Not his best -- if I had to choose I would say ""The Land Before Time"" is his best -- and the story is laughable at times, but it's still a decent film so long as you don't expect historical accuracy.

""Anastasia"" follows the titular princess, daughter of the tsar of Russia and one of the only members of the Romanoff family who (allegedly) might have escaped death during the Russian Revolution.  Ten years after said Revolution, an amnesiac girl named Anya (voiced by Meg Ryan) leaves the orphanage to find some clue as to her past.  Along the way she runs into Dmitri and Vladimir, two con men (John Cusack and Kelsey Grammar respectively) who decide she bears a striking resemblance to the missing Anastasia and decide to groom her into the perfect ""fake"" princess in order to swindle a hefty reward out of her grandmother, the Dowager Empress (Angela Landsbury -- this film really goes all out with its all-star cast) who managed to flee to Paris during the revolution.  As the three of them journey from Russia to Paris, they're tailed by the sinister Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd), a holy man who died during the Revolution but who, through a deal with ""dark forces,"" can't rest in his grave until he's killed the last of the Romanoff family.  Can the trio reach Paris before Rasputin destroys them... and once there, can Anya pass herself off as the missing princess?  Or will she meet a gruesome fate?

You've probably noticed by now that this film plays VERY fast and loose with history.  Not only is Rasputin now the main villain (no mention whatsoever is made of Lenin or any of the other individuals behind the Revolution), but there's a LOT of fantasy elements thrown in that feel jarring and out of place.  I know this film was made for children, but still, I feel a movie based on historical events has some responsibility to tell the truth, even if they dramatize it a little.  Much like Disney's ""Pocahontas,"" taking an actual historical event and turning it into a kid's fairy tale leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and turning the Russian Revolution into the backdrop for a Cinderella ripoff feels like a cheat to me.

Putting historical accuracy aside, the story is pretty predictable from start to finish.  There's absolutely no question that Anya is, in fact, the real Anastasia, and so there's little suspense or tension to be found there.  We also can tell pretty early on that Anya and Dmitri are going to end up falling in love -- if a couple start off fighting and bickering, of COURSE it's going to be true love.  But even though the story is familiar and predicable, the humorous banter between the characters makes for a watchable, even enjoyable film, and the strong voice cast helps to some degree (besides the above-mentioned actors, Hank Azaria, Bernadette Peters, and Jim Cummings lend their voices to the film as well).  The Russian accents veer from laughably bad to entirely nonexistent, of course, but I suppose that's to be expected when the film is made with mostly American voice actors.

Also, if you're annoyed by animal sidekicks, this film will drive you nuts.  Anya has her dog Pooka, who thankfully doesn't speak but whose high-pitched yapping can get obnoxious after awhile, and Rasputin has his bat sidekick Bartok.  I personally enjoyed some of Bartok's lines, even if he seemingly only exists to drop funny and/or snarky one-liners, but others may find him to be the Jar Jar Binks of the film.  Your mileage may vary, I suppose.

The animation is... passable.  The actual cel animation is a step or two below Disney's best, and it does fall into Bluth's usual traps of over-exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, grotesque character design (especially Rasputin and his demonic minions), and dark and grim environments.  But for the most part it flows nicely.  I did find the film's over-reliance on CGI annoying, though -- yes, filmmakers, we can tell the train is CGI.  And there was the weird decision to make even little objects like Anya's music box CGI, which just makes them stand out weirdly.  The most glaring example of this is a sink in the threesome's cabin in a boat -- did we REALLY need a CGI sink in the scene, especially when the characters sitting right next to it are in 2D animation?  And is it my imagination or is the CGI choppy in places?

And yes, given that this movie is doing its best to ape Disney, it's got musical numbers.  Thankfully, most of these musical numbers are not only tolerable, they're actually enjoyable.  ""Once Upon a December"" would have to be the best of the numbers, though ""Journey to the Past"" and the end-credits number ""At the Beginning"" are quite good as well, and Rasputin gets an epic rock-flavored villain song in ""In the Dark of the Night.""  ""Rumor in St. Petersberg"" and ""Learn To Do It"" sound almost like they belong in a Rogers and Hammerstein production, and ""Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)""... I hate to say it, but it's my least favorite song from the soundtrack.  It feels entirely unnecessary and added just for the sake of having one final musical number to fill some quota.

""Anastasia"" is not a perfect film, or even a great film.  The animation is problematic, the story is predictable, and don't expect it to adhere to historical fact in any fashion.  But all the same, it's one of the better Bluth films, and it's enjoyable enough to watch and to listen to.  It just strikes me as a really weird choice for an animated fairy tale, and throwing fairy-tale elements into the Russian Revolution feels kind of strange.  Then again, kids probably won't care and will just enjoy Anya's journey.  Probably best for kids 8 and up due to some dark and frightening imagery.",1470182400,,6545,4.679475982532751

936575,3,6304872402,"The villain was disturbing; I was surprised at how overly grotesque ALL the villain's scenes were, to the point of bizarre caricaturing; this in an animated film, what I thought was kind of a kids movie. After one or two scenes like that, I just started skipping all the villain scenes. I didn't miss any plot elements that weren't either explained later or easily conjectured, and I enjoyed the rest of the movie.
Apart from everything having to do with the villain, I really liked this movie. It has some really pretty songs, the kind that you end up singing to yourself after the movie's over. It's actually a pretty cute movie in its way.",1467763200,2,642,4.591304347826087

Suggest that a child should want a life of glittering balls and parties over reality without any mention of the cold, hunger, loneliness and fear that an abandoned girl would feel in the middle of a national revolution, not to mention one whose family was considered to be the cause of national destitution.  Completely out of touch.  Also, the depiction of evil was at times too lurid and at times too frivolous.  The animation was fine, the story was pathetic.",1465171200,,538,4.98876404494382

937374,2,6304872402,"This movie is too dark for young kids, explains away the Russian revolution as Rasputin's vendetta against the Romanovs (wasn't it more or less their cousin the Kaiser who sent Lenin back to take them out?) and has a rather fringe theological relationship with demons and ""limbo"" (which even if you buy the premise was for those who died in the good graces of God but were kept out of heaven for original sin until Christ redeemed them--not for people who sold their souls to the devil).  The video was annoyingly choppy. (we watched on Amazon Prime Video over Apple TV--I allow for the possibility that this was due to heavy traffic on the internet etc.)  We had to do a lot of damage control with our daughter even though she was bored through most of it.  There was some good voice work though.",1459036800,2,797,4.520833333333333

The story is based on a real story in the the period of the Romanoffs, late 1800 's in Russia..The theme goes way deep,  as a Christian you will rejoice at the ending, if you are still searching you will see how the power of God smashes the power of the evil one...with humility and nobility unlike the 'this will require superhuman violence to win' movies like Braveheart and Die Hard and most action flicks. Yet this enemy is the deadliest and has already caused a tsunami of misery, wiping out almost an entire generation!...Greatly inspirational and uplifting.. but not for young kids without a strong parental presence to help them understand the scary scenes and reassure them.",1456617600,4,841,4.7534246575342465

938634,3,6304872402,"The movie is based on the legend of the Czar family, when the Russian royal family was destroyed by revolutionists and Anastasia was the surviving heir to the Czar crown. In movie, the Czars was cursed because of their involvement with the mad monk, Rasputin. In real life, the entire family was slaughtered without survivors, but the movie entertains the possibility that Princess Anastasia Czar survived somehow.

Lost and separated from her family, Anastasia lost her childhood memories during the initial attack of the revolution; she was raised in an orphanage and goes by the name of Anya. Desiring to find answers about her identity, her necklace was the only clue to her family and she wishes to head to France to find them. Unable to get a pass, Anya encounters former royal employees attempting to scam the surviving Czars for money. With the help of Dimitri, she is poised to pose as the ""fake"" Princess to get the reward money. In between making it to France, Rasputin attempts to kill Anastasia to complete his revenge.

This is your classic story of the lady falling for the swindler and the swindler has a change of heart with a mix of rags to riches story. The movie could've been easily confused for a Disney movie, but it's actually done by Fox, mixing CG and old style animation together. If you're not a musical fan, you're not going to like it when they suddenly break into a number from time to time. Beyond that, the plot is very simple and nothing complex. If you watched a lot of TV and movies, you already have an idea how the story plays out and ends, which makes it predictably boring. However, if you want a feel good movie about two people coming together from a con job, you'll like this one.",1448323200,,1723,4.609120521172638

It keeps you on your toes and offers layers and depths not often seen in animation.

940292,4,6304872402,"Historical inaccuracies aside (I mean, all of the Rominovs were dumped into a pit after being shot down in a basement) I am almost ashamed to say it, I enjoyed this movie. I really did! As always, Bluth had superb animation and props to him for actually doing a movie with humans rather than anthropomorphic animals. I grew up with Land Before Time and American Tale (or was it Tail?) so I kind of felt a bit of nostalgia seeing this, even though it was the first time for me.
I remember seeing advertisements for this movie when I was a kid, Denny's had a sort of thing going and they gave away this toy train set with a track that I absolutely loved to death. We never went to Denny's, but when we did it was when this movie was released. Yet I never saw this movie. Better late than never...
The finale was a little underwhelming, I had to fight the urge to gag whenever a music number came up and of course it has the cliched ""Happily Ever After (tm)"" ending comes into play(the only twist being choosing rags over riches), but you know what? That's alright! While it's hard to picture America's Sweetheart as a Russian Princess, or John Cusack as a Russian conman, as neither of them even attempted anything close to a Russian accent, that doesn't detract from the fact that a grown... erm... butt (keepin' it rated G) 22 year old whatever thoroughly enjoyed watching this kid's movie for the first time, for some reason...
I always loved Christopher Lloyd, so that's also a plus, and at least he tried to have a Russian accent...
Okay, I enjoyed it, it wasn't perfect but it brought a smile to my cold heart... 4/5",1438819200,3,1620,4.421404682274248

At first I thought it would be another Disney like production of a giddy girl who falls in love, but there is a scary villain who gets in the way.  When I watched it, my mind was changed completely.  Anastasia, the main character, is a headstrong woman with an unknown past.  A conman named Dimitri convinces her that she is the missing Grand Duchess Anastasia for the reward money, not knowing that she actually is.  An unlikely romance falls between them, and they fall in love.  This is one of the best animations I've ever seen, despite the weird cover.

940630,1,6304872402,Terrible. Not suitable for young children that typically enjoy a princess movie. Rasputin's character is despicable and grotesquely graphic. He kills an entire family. That's the entire premise of the movie. Just terrible.,1434499200,,222,5.757575757575758

940752,1,6304872402,"Making the last Russian Czar and his family the heroes while blaming the communist revolution against these abusive and despotic hereditary monarchs on the evil wizard Rasputin is just too much childish idiocy for me to stomach. Theirs was a society based on slavery, while the nobility lived in absolute luxury the serfs were treated worse than animals. As far as I'm concerned the Czar and his family got what was coming to them. Sic semper tyrannis. Unfortunately the Russian revolution produced despots as bad if not worse than those they replaced but that's another story entirely. This is some serious Disney princess bs and stories such as this one should be set in a mythical time and not a historical one.",1433808000,2,714,4.860655737704918

940932,4,6304872402,"So if you have children that are easily frightened this one may be something you want to wait on until they are a little bit older. My kids watched this movie a lot and took the time to watch it again now that they are older and it reminded me how freaked out they had gotten the first time around. When Rasputin does his magic, there really is a darkness to it. Plus the character is drawn in one of the creepiest possible ways. He obviously means to do harm and there is no way you can mistake him for anything other than a bad guy.
The voice overs for this movie are actually very fitting. There are times where the voices don't match the characters but the choices made for this movie are extremely fitting and don't leave you wondering why a certain character's voice sounds that way. The animation is actually very good, it is not Disney but it is well drawn and the time that it depicts is actually very detailed. The story itself is well put together, though it lacks some history to it, after all it is a kids movie. The writing of the story overall tells a story that keeps the kids engaged and won't bore the parents while watching it.",1431734400,,1146,4.285714285714286

Personally, I think this was a very good show. Good writing, and a good story line. Unlike a lot of shows that have long, drawn out parts of the show, there really did not seem to be any in this one., It is about overcoming the odds, finding family, and love in the process. You have tragedy, and redemption. and best of all, unlike most newer shows that revolve around sex appeal, this show pretty much completely leaves the gender discrimination, or sex appeal out of it. It revolves around the story line, and not around being male or female, or lack of abilities. but what people can overcome. It is just a well made and written movie. I would recommend it to people of all ages.",1427673600,2,857,4.257668711656442

I really wish studios would continue producing these fantastic hand-drawn movies. Anastasia was quite profitable and was warmly received. Thank you Fox Animation Studios for giving a couple former Disney animators another shot.

A great voice cast, good pacing, and a really heart-warming tale. This ranks up there with the best Disney productions.",1427500800,2,561,5.222222222222222

Adventure, romance, family reunions, and cute animals - what's not to love? All star cast on voices, interesting bit of historical fiction (a lot more fiction than facts; think of it as a teachable moment :).  The sound track (though lovely) and animation is what date it the most, but it was refreshing to see old school animation.

941676,2,6304872402,"Everybody always said that this was one of their favorite animated features, and I really do like animated movies. Disney is delightful and wonderful, as are many other animated films not done by Disney. But this is not one of them. The musical numbers were sub-par (perhaps with the exception of ""Once Upon a December"") and the animation itself was ABSOLUTELY sub-par. Granted, it was 1997, so computer technology was improving, but it seemed like the production studio would go out of their way to insert scenes where they could use the new tech and the effect was jarring and not pleasing at all. Disney at this same time was creating Tarzan, and the animation in that is exquisite. Also, Meg Ryan just BUGS. Even her voice.

The only thing I sort of enjoyed about this was Rasputin. He was a super creepy villain, even though he was one dimensional and made less creepy by being ridiculously silly. If they had let him be more creepy the film would have benefited.",1426636800,,968,4.6608187134502925

Since this cartoon was made by Fox, it does not feature very many super catchy songs like Disney does, but the songs are pretty fun nonetheless.

This movie is pretty fun packed with adventure, magic, romance, comedy, and it does feature some elements of your average ""make-over"" movie, but not done in an obnoxious way.

942245,1,6304872402,"The story line is quite incredible and based on a true story; HOWEVER, this animated movie is just plain scary for children with the villain not just being presented as dark and evil as usual, but fully demon possessed (and they show it). I remember watching this as a teenager when it came out and thinking, ""oh my gosh, this is for kids?!"" I swore then that I would never let my own children watch this until they were at least teenagers and able to handle the intensity of what was being portrayed and we could have a conversation around it. It shouldn't be rated G, but PG-13. Please don't think because it is animated that it is suitable for younger children. This is a dark, zombiesque, movie that is not ""cute"" as other reviewers describe it.",1420848000,3,749,4.474452554744525

943085,1,6304872402,"I am glad I watched this movie before letting my kids see it. You would think that a movie that is rated G should be acceptable for the most part for all audiences. This movie has a very dark sadistic villain who uses witchcraft and voodoo to attack the royal family. Not only that he actually ends up dying and returning as an undead to continue his vow to kill off the entire royal family.

While my 9 year old son could rationalize the dark humor, my three younger girls were troubled by the ending where Rasputin's body dissolves. In one part his head gets sucked into his body, his eyes bulge out and his hand pops off. It wasn't presented in a humorous way, like, say Looney Tunes cartoons are. Just know, that for younger children, parent's should be close by to explain scenes and answer questions.

Without gore, there could have been a line ""though of course we loved the dances and the joy we had, others were not so fortunate"" and a small shot of some poor people or a Kossack being unreasonable with a poor peasant. But to have the whole beginning simply extol the glory of the Czar's rule without the tiniest hint that something else might be going on and led me to turn it off 1/3 of the way through.",1416268800,,683,4.221374045801527

I continued watching as the prelude finished and the movie actually started.  It seemed like it was going to be a sweet movie - but before long the ghouls were back.  It was not expensive so I didn't return it  but just put it on a shelf.  To be fair to the movie, I only watched for about 15 minutes - maybe it gets better.

943953,4,6304872402,"Anastasia Romanov never escaped assassination. She was murdered alongside the rest of the Russian royal family in 1918, and as of late 2007, there's been no doubt about this. However, the fact that this movie - released ten years prior to the discovery of Anastasia's apparent grave - makes use of the former uncertainty of her fate does not diminish it as historical fiction. Anastasia was as dead in 1997 as she was when the last doubts about her survival were swept aside, but the creativity that her legend inspired is still very watchable 17 years after its release. Largely considered director Don Bluth's last great cinematic success, ""Anastasia"" is an imperfect but nevertheless beautiful storybook version of what might have happened.

The story: While being groomed to impersonate the long-lost grand duchess of Russia by a handsome con man (John Cusack), an orphaned young woman called Anya (Meg Ryan) slowly awakens to her identity as the real Anastasia Romanov. At the same time, she is hunted by the undead sorcerer Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd), who seeks to carry out his deadly curse against the royal family.

With this movie, Don Bluth and co-director Gary Goldman achieve a harmonious balance of style, story, and production that had eluded them for a decade. While it's debatable whether ""Anastasia"" is on the same level as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-NIMH/dp/6305161887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of NIMH</a>, it's definitely a big step up from fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Troll-in-Central-Park/dp/B000A2WARE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Troll in Central Park</a>. ""Anastasia"" deals with themes common in many kids' movies, but simply setting the story against the backdrop of the Russian revolution immediately gives it some added maturity. While the movie skirts around historical facts and politics, I think the historically-informed viewer would appreciate it even more than those less familiar with Russian history: scenes of the adult Anya piecing together her identity are much more satisfying when you know how the real Anastasia lived, and it makes the dance in the ballroom extremely emotional.

The casting is quite good. The main troop also includes Kelsey Grammer as the second conspirator, Angela Lansbury as the Dowager Empress, and Hank Azaria as Rasputin's mediating bat-sidekick (one of my favorite characters of all time), and I think it's safe to say that all of the performers get the most out of their roles. The strong voice work is melded with Bluth's gorgeous animation, and the result is an intriguing ensemble that's both intriguing and beautiful. I'm less pleased with the proliferation of CGI, though: it immediately dates the movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titan-A-E/dp/B00005AB62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titan A.E.</a>, Bluth's 2000 film, would already render this one's graphics obsolete), and while some computer-generated sets are used to good effect, individual CGI props look jarringly out-of-place alongside the traditionally-animated characters.

Another major aspect of the film that I'm not happy about is the Rasputin character. The legendary ""mad monk"" is a persistent example of Hollywood's imagination being unable to match reality, and Bluth's two-dimensional Rasputin is nowhere near as intriguing as the real man. (NOTE: Previous versions of the screenplay supposedly offered a more layered version of the character, but this was toned down for being too dark.) With that said, Rasputin does get a killer musical anthem, and this reflects the strength of the movie's musical content. The Oscar-nominated soundtrack is not without some ho-hum material, but songs like ""In the Dark of the Night,"" ""Once Upon a December,"" and especially ""Journey to the Past"" are symphonic powerhouses that could go toe-to-toe with the best efforts of Disney's composers any day.

""Anastasia"" probably won't be played in many classrooms, but it is the type of movie that could spark a young person's interest in history, and a worthy addition to the libraries of animation fans in general. I haven't always been as big of a fan of the film as I am now, but repeat viewings while I learned more about the story behind the fantasy have formed it into a gem. As a beautiful picture with an engaging narrative and only a handful of flaws, I can recommend it to just about everybody other than the history die-hards.

I have seen this movie other times, but behind this movie is factual historical value. The voices for the characters are all familiar so there is really no surprise to the dialogue. A movie to watch as a family, or for young adults. Music and some frightening scenes if you have family members that are sensitive to some of it.

So did we, as adults, and even our 15-year-old (who is very into video games and animation) enjoyed the story and was in raptures over the animation.  I recommend it, but just be forewarned that if you have toddlers who are particularly sensitive, you'll need to do a bit of snuggling during the scary bits.",1411516800,,584,4.640776699029126

944739,5,6304872402,"This past weekend I revisited a movie that was a favorite of mine from my childhood. Anastasia is an animated movie that is filled with adventure and drama. This must-see film was directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldmon and released into theaters in late November, 1997.
This movie is based upon a true historical event that occurred near the 1920s in St. Petersburg, Russia. However, this is an animated movie for children, not a documentary. After a tragic attack to the Romanovs, the Russian royal family during the 1920s, only the grandmother, Dowager Empress Marie, and granddaughter, Anastasia, escaped safely. Soon after escaping the palace, Dowager Empress Marie and Anastasia were quickly separated. The lost Anastasia (Meg Ryan), after being orphaned for ten years, joins two conmen, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladmir (Kelsey Grammer), to help her on the journey of finding her grandmother. If only it were that simple. Throughout their quest to find Anastasias family, an undead villain, Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd), is looking to finish what he started ten years ago in his attempts to take over the world.
I would like to talk about how this movie relates to the actual historical event and the accuracy to the time period. Of course, there isn't much that agrees with the true story, but there are some small details within the movie that are accurate. My first example would be in the beginning of the movie. A scene in the movie shows Alexei moving around with a limp. Anastasias younger brother, Alexei, was born with hemophilia, which affected his ability to walk. Another example of the actual event is the attention to detail that the artists used when designing the settings throughout the movie. The soundtrack has Russian musicality and the setting of St. Petersburg looks like the actual St. Petersburg in the 1920s!
As we all know, a cartoon is only as good as its animation. We all remember how terrible Shrek the Third was. With Anastasia, the design team hit the nail right on the head and went above and beyond their expectations. Along with being a musical masterpiece, the designers pulled out all of the stops to make the film filled with amplifying beauty and just overall magical scenes. The scene where Anastasia sings Once Upon a December is purely breathtaking. Each scene gives you something new to look at and will always grab your attention.
The casting of this movie was wonderfully selected for every role. Ryan and Cusack play out the love-hate relationship between their characters as if they had actually been experiencing it. The humorous comments between the two will keep every person, no matter what age, intrigued. Also, because of his naturally raspy voice, Christopher Lloyd did very well when portraying his evil character, Rasputin.
All in all, there wasn't a single disappointment within the film. After watching the movie, I found myself comparing it to Disney films about princesses. Anastasia kept me more involved and absorbed than some of Disneys classics: Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Sleeping Beauty, etc. My favorite movie as a child is still entertaining ten years later!",1411430400,,3152,5.02868068833652

944830,4,6304872402,"Fun cartoon, if you ok with anti-hero (""Rasputin"") falling apart and his bones and head dancing between grave worms...
Of course, some strange parts, like, for example, empty palace where Dmitry and his friends living and where still left all that goodies from tsar family... and Anastasia able come there and dance in almost empty palace and try to remember her past...(As we know, after revolution all tsar family goodies are stolen by revolutioners and New Government working at the Palace).
Funny impossible parts, where tsar family dressing up like tsar family hundreds year ago before that time... where Russian people dancing & singing on the street... Dmitry & his friend sliding from the roof (second floor!) ....  or where Anastasia's grandma wear huge & heavy tiara to the ballet for no reason...
Oh, well, that cartoon can be not about Russia, but about any other European family (because didn't use any real facts nor places), but its fun, musical and probably good for kids.",1411171200,,988,4.987878787878788

945318,5,6304872402,"Is this a fairy tale, a folk tale, or is it historical? Or is it a combination of all three?

Grigori Rasputin is a real character from history, who eventually became a private adviser to the Romanovs. But of course, he is not the eerie character as he is animated to be in this cute film.

There were actual people named Anastasia back in the early twentieth century, but we don't know if any of them were truly a survivor from the Romanov family, descended from the last Tsar of Russia.

Whether the film has much historical accuracy or not, it is still a delightful film. It is possible that, in all the confusion that surrounded the death of the Tsar and his family, that one or two may have escaped.

Whether you have kids, or whether you watch this by yourself, I highly recommend this film. If you watch it with your kids, you can follow up by showing your kids some information at the library (or on the web) about the real Romanov's, Rasputin, and some of the several ladies who have the name Anastasia. They might learn the enjoyment of reading about subjects that they have seen in movies.",1409875200,,1100,4.430693069306931

The movie can be a little creepy I remember being terrified of Rasputin and he is a little gross since his parts keep falling off but there are plenty of cuddly adorable characters to take your mind off of him. This movie attempts to put an ending with the hunt for Anastasia, the real life story is unfortunately not as romantic and wonderful as this one.

945770,5,6304872402,"Meg Ryan and John Cusack speak for the animated characters in this musical cartoon.  The puppy dog, Pooka is a nice touch and anyone would fall in love with him as he helps Anastasia stay safe on the journey to Paris to reclaim her royal ancestry.  Kelsey Grammer's voice is wonderful as the older man who tries to match up Anastasia with her grandmother and keep the adventure on an even keel.  Evil Rasputin comes back from the dead in a very scary scene and delivers many hardships for the sweet Anastasia as he tries to do her in.  It would be a nice and neat packaged story in real life if all of these events truly did happen to reclaim Anastasia's rightful air to the throne of Russia, but my understanding is that the truth really never was certain.  How could Anastasia live after being shot so many times?  I love this story.  It is great for kids and adults alike.",1396742400,,875,4.364197530864198

I would by no means use this as a movie to show the history of that time period. And as a child I never considered the story to really be true, but as a standalone story it is very enjoyable. Especially watching this blu-ray, they touched up the overall quality of the film which gives it an even more fantastical feel.",1393804800,,455,4.428571428571429

946055,5,6304872402,"The ""Based on a true story..."" tagline on the back of the DVD box is highly misleading.  The Romanovs were detained by the Red Army and then executed in their basement.  They did not escape the communist forces that were taking over the country.  Even so, Don Bluth and company have rewritten history for a child friendly film that is sure to entertain for a couple of hours.

Anastasia is separated from her family during their escape from the family palace in Moscow, and is relegated to the life of a young vagabond girl who runs into an equally vagabond young man who, as fate would have it, served in her families household.

It is a heart warming tale of a girl lost from her parents only to rediscover their fate in one of the world's most romantic cities.  Don Bluth's animated production values, character designs and animation itself, are unparalled as usual.  Character expressions, gestures, and overall movement and perspective are first rate, and beat anything foreign or domestic at the time it was made.

My only beef is that the DVD cover art on the disk I bought is not the classic still from the film with Anastasia looking up at the viewer, but the idiotic cartoonified pose of the two main characters holding hands with one another at the base of a staircase.  Oh well.

Buy a copy and see the film for yourself.  Yes, it is not historically accurate in the least.  It's a children's cartoon.  But you will find yourself liking it all the same.",1392940800,8,1465,4.588461538461538

The entire reason I wanted to buy it wasn't because it was the greatest movie ever made (though I do enjoy it), but because I am an animator and their ""Making of"" documentary is especially good.  I have had a heck of a time trying to buy Anastasia - the first time I bought it /new/ at MovieStop and it didn't work (not to knock MovieStop, as that hardly ever happens).  A tried again a few years later while I was teaching Animation this past semester because I wanted to show the documentary to my students.  At that time, I bought the Family Fun edition which says it has the ""Making of"" Anastasia, but it was nowhere to be found on either of the two DVD's it came with (the second DVD was Bartok the Magnificent...which is cool, but I wanted the documentary).  So I returned it.  Since then I hadn't had any luck finding it in stores and figured I'd try my luck on Amazon.  To be honest, I was a little nervous about ordering it online because the Family Fun edition said it had the documentary when, as far as I knew, it didn't.  I wasn't sure if this DVD would be the same (the cover even looks similar-ish).  But there was a review on here that specifically commented on the documentary, which sealed the deal for me.  I want to confirm that the documentary is indeed on this DVD.  Finally, my search is over, and my animation students can now watch the documentary later this semester!

946376,5,6304872402,"Ok, just to get this out there: this movie is straight up a historical fiction.  This is not a docudrama, dramatized history, or whatever non-fiction derivatives there are.  But with that said, this was a brilliant film with a truly complimentary set of ""extras"" thrown in.  This being their first animated theatrical feature, 20th Century fox definitely shows their pride through the package of this film.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Ok, this is definitely a family film.  No innuendos or nudity type stuff, no language issues...this is a safe film.  There is violence, but it is well-purposed and not all that vicious.  What I will say, though, is that the villain, Rasputin, can be kinda scary for young kids.  In many ways, his visual presentation is a bit more horrifying/intimidating than most if not all Disney villains out there.  So I would wait for kids to at least be around 10 years of age (as a general suggestion).  But, again, totally nothing to worry about.

PLOT (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
I won't discuss plot points and things, but will just give a general impression.  I really did enjoy the narrative that was told.  It's nothing too complexed but it is told well and presented well.  It definitely is pretty straight forward.  Ultimately, I felt satisfied and complete.  Actually, I felt refreshed and warm fuzzies haha  But, though it was very very well done, I have to say, they really could have slowed down a bit and explored a little more of the ambience.  I would have loved to see more of the happenings in Russia and in Paris.  I would have loved to explore more of the ambient aspects of their train ride.  The film really followed a blatantly point-A-to-point-B kind of storytelling.  I AM DEFINITELY NOT SAYING THIS IS A  TERRIBLY BAD THING, AT ALL.  Again, it was good, but a little more ""looking around"" instead of rushing through would have been a wonderful way to greatly enhance the tale.  But, the character interaction really makes this film...especially the main 3.

MUSIC:
Yes, this is a musical...and it's this part that really helps make this tale, fly.  I loved all the numbers except for one...and the music was smartly written, well placed, led up to in a believable manner.  If you want a good taste, the song ""Once Upon a December"" is really the musical keystone of the film.

EXTRAS:
I won't list all of them, since they are already listed in the main product description area.  All of them are excellent and fun little additions (though I think the stacking doll game could have been a little more ""entertaining"").  But I would like to draw special attention to the ""making of"" mini-documentary.  This is, by far, one of the best ""making of"" mini-documentaries that I've seen included with a film or tv series and should be a standard for such things.  Often times, other ones simply touch and grace the various aspects of the production process.  But, here, they go into greater depth.  Not only do you hear about ""experiences"" and ""opinions"" from the staff, but they take you through the animation process, the voice over/singing process, and a whole ton of other things, as well.  It's not as good as a more focused documentary in say Discovery or Smithsonian....but they really take you much deeper than most DVD Extras type documentaries I have personally seen.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a wonderful film for the whole family.  A lot of wonderful lessons and fun interactions.  Also, strong acting as well.  It may be a bit more straightforward than some of would like, but for me, that did not ruin the experience at all.  And the music was simply wonderful.  I do think that this film comes fairly close to being a classic in animated movies, just my opinion of course.  Either way, I hope you take it for a spin and that you'll enjoy this gem, as well.",1386028800,,3794,4.703647416413374

946605,5,6304872402,"I remember this movie airing on TV a lot a few years after it came out, and having recently rewatched a lot of favorite disney movies, I decided to revisit something else from my childhood. I wasn't really expecting all that much out of it, but even as an adult, I think this is a pretty great movie. It takes its starting point from historical events, but turns into a very sweet fairy tale about family and finding yourself. Its obviously in the DIsney Princess tradition, and I enjoyed it as much as any of those films. The characters are a lot of fun, and its nice that we see Dimitri and Anya spending enough time together for a plausible romance to develop. While the villain, Rasputin, can be quite comical, there are also some genuinely scary scenes, such as when Anya almost jumps off the boat while in an enchanted dream about her forgotten family. The animation is quite beautiful, and I was specially moved by the sequence where Anya wanders through the old palace, seeing ghosts of her former life. The glitz and glamour of Paris are also well-depicted, and images such as a Chanel store and the Moulin Rouge remind us that this film is set in our own world, not too long ago. There's something about the way Anya uncovers her past, with the haunting song (Once Upon a December), the necklace and the music box, that gives the film a really beautiful magical quality. All in all, I would say that this film is a bit of a forgotten gem that I definitely recommend. Of course, there is the undeniable fact that this movie takes a troublesome time from history and gives it the fairy tale treatment, and it can definitely be perceived as trivializing the events of the Russian Revolution. In my own mind, I was able to disassociate the film from history fairly easily, and I treated it as a separate entity. If you're a person who doesn't like the idea of watching a movie that glosses over unhappy historical events and gives them the fantasy treatment, this movie probably isn't for you.",1374278400,,1999,4.555555555555555

I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration is excellent for this movie. All other Don Bluth blu rays video transfers are awful. So this is my opinion of the video quality of the classics:

946919,4,6304872402,"Don Bluth's films are very much hit or miss, but while this doesn't quite hit the same heights as Secret of NIHM or An American Tail it is still a very beautiful, enjoyable picture. One of the problems with the film is that the animation, while fluid, tends to be a bit on the stilted side. Often the characters feel like they're stuck on a small soundstage without a lot of room to move around, even when they have huge environments to move around in. This becomes especially noticeable in the final action scenes at the end.

The film also doesn't have quite the ""epic"" feel that a tale like this really needs, in part because of the pacing and editing. A mere minute or two more added to the film to throw in a few more lines here and there explaining character motivations and giving some of the scenes time to breathe would have gone a long way. And other than ""A Rumor in St. Petersburg"" the visuals in the musical numbers tend to be a little more bland than they should be. ""In the Dark of the Night"" is especially infamous for this. The visuals aren't nearly as interesting, inventive, or captivating as the song itself (which is, in my opinion, by far the highlight of the soundtrack).

The music itself tends to be fairly forgettable, but I fault this on the aforementioned animation rather than the songs themselves. I found ""Journey to the Past"" especially boring the first time I watched the film, to the point where I actually gave up watching the movie and didn't come back to finish until years later. But listening to the same song later by itself on the soundtrack I really enjoyed it! It's a pity so many of the songs came across as so forgettable because they're really pretty catchy and should have been far more memorable than they ended up being in the film.

All in all, this movie could have been so much better, but it still managed to get stuck in my head. There's something to say for a movie that's able to stick with you despite its faults. It'll probably get many more viewings from me in the future.",1363219200,,2031,4.439678284182306

947085,5,6304872402,"*FILM*
Don Bluth's last and greatest film. With the feel of a live action film, this enthralling movie retains the storyline of a traditional animated film. It lacks the crude and unforgiving story and design that much earlier Bluth films carry, most likely resulting in the greater appeal of the film. Bluths first to feature humans as the central protagonists. Shot in cinematic widescreen, this movie is epic. Touching on themes of history and having a theme of mystery and of an elderly woman reliving the past... James Cameron, you are a cereal cartoon 'plunderer', but I don't suppose we can blame you for this one as it was released only about 1 month before Titanic, unlike Fern Gully, which was 15 freaking years before Avatar, right around the time that you said you got the idea for it. Anastasia is truly wonderful. Its pretty much flawless and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Some magician shows up and puts a curse on the girls family which of course causes communism in Russia.  Some guy offers a big reward if someone can find the little girl, but she was at an orphanage and had lost her memory or something like that.  There was something about a job at a factory that processes fish, and a stray dog was in there somewhere as well.  It was about this point that I got off the couch, went upstairs, and installed all of the AV gear in my 12 year old daughters room so she can watch this kind of mess in HER room, and I won't ever have to sit thru something like this again.

Her grandmother offers a reward of 10 million rubles to anyone who can find Anastasia and have her come back to her. Dimitri and Vlad are scheming to have auditions to have an Anastasia look a like and they unexpectedly find the real Anastasia knowing it was really her til the middle/end. And Dimitri and Anastasia fall in love. But Rasputin is using his evil powers to try and kill her to complete his curse that he put on the family years ago. But can the good guys stop him? My favorite part was when Anastasia and the grandmother were reunited and that Anastasia and Dimitri were together and they promised to visit grandmother and sophie in the future. The movie has a great soundtrack to it and great songs. I sing a long to them all the time. Its hard to pick favorite songs to it because they're all awesome and I love them all. But I love Journey to the Past, the movie version and the version sung by Aaliyah (God rest her soul) Learn to Do It and Once Upon a December and I love In THe Dark of the Night by the guy who played Rasputin. I wish there was a prequel and a sequel to this movie. The prequel would be what Anastasias life was like before all the bad stuff happened. And the sequel could have Anastasia and Dimitri getting married in Paris and they bring everyone including grandmother Sophie and Vlad. And Rasputin could come back from the dead seeking revenge. Some people complain about this film not being historically accurate. They are right but they need to understand that this film is a family film and you don't want violence and gore in it because thats what really happened and you don't want children seeing that.",1312502400,,1904,4.38135593220339

The only thing that might prove a little scary for the kids is the villan. Rasputin. Based on  the man of the same name that was famous for being extremely hard to kill.  He's basically a walking zombie  with an annoying voice but if it were anything too scary I wouldn't have given it five stars. (I was one of the most  nightmare-prone children on the planet when it came to movies yet I simply loved this even then.).

It is quite simply a masterpiece, a significant step up from the more familiar early films.  From the quality of the drawing (rich & vivid colors, capturing light most remarkably) to the original music (yes, they burst into song but the melodies are quite compelling and not syrupy at all) to the well-known voice talents, this film really drew me in.  The story is not at all what one would expect for a movie aimed at kids:  Russian Tsar Nicholas II's entire family was arrested, confined and eventually brutally executed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but it was speculated at the time that one young daughter, Anastasia, escaped from the palace and so survived.  The film's focus is on the orphaned girl and her search for her family, it is handled well and even believably (although DNA evidence has since disproven the possibility).  As well, the bonus features on Disc 2 of the Family Fun Pack edition included ""The Making of Anastasia"", a behind-the-scenes look at the entire production with commentary by Gary Goldman & Don Bluth, which was excellent.

947588,2,6304872402,"I've just come back from a train wreck. The cause seems to have been that there were two different trains moving in diametrically opposed directions at very high speeds. The result is this terrible, animated mess of a film.

Now, Anastasia is often remembered by most as a successful 1990's member of the in-illustrious Don Bluth canon of quasi-Disney disasters that have managed to accomplish the following: introducing horrible nightmares into the minds of countless children with their inexplicably morbid images and flashy sequences, causing mass confusion over which popular animated films are (or are not) from the Disney corporation, and (it is speculated) helping to trigger the so-called ""Disney Renaissance"" that gave birth to such classics as Aladdin and the Lion King (and, it should be noted, such duds as Pocahontas and The Hunchback) by providing the only viable competition in the industry.

What is however not usually recognized about this film (or the Bluth canon) is that it is not just the product of Don Bluth but rather Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, Bluth's longtime friend and collaborator. Typically Goldman has played the role of ""supporting man"" to Bluth's creative engine, doing work as a co-producer or co-animator, but in a significant number of Bluth's films he also co-directed. It is noteworthy that these particular films are some of Bluth's absolute worst.

The reason I mention this relationship is that it is apparent from watching this film that the dual-headed nature of this film's production is a good explanation for what may have gone wrong with it, since watching it is such an jarring and disjointed experience. In the end, it is an aesthetically pretty mess that was shoddily strung together and prematurely delivered to market and there is this odd unfinished feel to the movie throughout, in-spite of the detailed, awkward animation which itself appears to be more than complete.

This is an ahistorical tale about princess Anastasia, daughter of the last Czar of Imperial Russia, Nicholas II, who was alleged to have inexplicably disappeared sometime between the time her family was massacred by the Bolsheviks, with her included it now turns out, and the time in which someone outside of this event bothered to take a head-count. One theory, now discredited, which is explored by this movie, was that the princess had escaped the fate of her family members only to finally remerge publicly many years later. Many people decry this film for abusing and even grossly distorting the historicity of these events but I am not concerned with that here. I see no reason why we couldn't just pretend that this is fantasy and enjoy the film on other merits, but in fact those other merits wound up being impossible for me to enjoy.

What really irks me about this movie is how the narrative unfolds in such as way as to make you feel crazy. One moment Anastasia is characterized as a naive, sweet peasant girl, fulfilling stock Disney princess traits ""borrowed"" from Disney classics like Snow White or Cinderella. The next moment, however, she's become, without proper instigation, a sarcastic harpy clawing away at the film's male love interest and then, quite suddenly, transforming back again without explanation. As if this more subtle disjointed characterization were not sufficient, in early scenes Anastasia is shown with short brown hair under a Muscovite hat only to emerge later with long reddish hair that, again, clearly ""borrows"" it's look from Disney's Ariel of the Little Mermaid.

Other characters fair no better. The annoying Disney-esque familiar to our villain, Rasputan, is an obnoxious little white bat (which channels Iago from Aladdin) who inexplicably moves from being a sinister and vindictive side-kick to an unwilling and disinterested participant to his master's evil scheme. While I am all for a villain having some kind of moral conversion in the course of a story I would at least like to have a reason given for such a change.
But there are no reasons given and it is as if there were two different people working on this film with two different ideas about what the finished product ought to look and feel like. Personalities change, physical appearances change, sequences seem like they were out of place or even done as possible, mutually exclusive alternatives and then just thrown into the final mix anyway and so on. There are countless continuity errors, non-sequiturs, garbled quick fixes and implausible conveniences smattered all over the face of this production and it is jarring to viewer.

At first I sort of liked this movie. I like the subject matter, I like the look of the film, the soundtrack (which is oddly good for a Don Bluth movie) and I even like the voice acting for the most part. But in the end I found myself getting ripped away from what I was watching by the constant distraction of absurdity and inconsistency that made me recognize all the more that I was really just watching a shoddy, overly ambitious mess.

Perhaps if there were only one captain of the ship then this movie would have been more even handed and some of the big decisions about what was to result could have been made so as to produce something more coherent and polished. As is typical with Don Bluth, there was a lot wasted potential in this film.

947640,5,6304872402,"Ok,first of all, I'd like to start off by saying that before this film came out in 1997, I had little to no knowledge of Russian history or culture.  The only thing I knew about Russia was its figure skaters and that Russia used to be a communist nation.  I can remember after the movie was over thinking ""what a nice fairy tale.""  I had absolutely no idea that Anastasia or the Romanovs were real people.  But after seeing the film and learning that Anastasia was a real person, and the story itself was LOOSELY based on historical events, I began to research Russian history and culture and have really enjoyed it.

The film ""Anastasia"" while not historically accurate by a long shot, is still a great movie with breathtaking animation and a wonderful musical score.  I still can't get the song ""Once upon a December"" out of my head.  The DVD itself has a lot of very entertaining bonus features including: a making of featurette (I'm a sucker for those things), a ""Once upon a December"" sing-a-long, and Aaliyah's music video for ""Journey to the Past.""  My favorite bonus feature is the tour of the imperial palace.  During the tour, you can click on objects in the palace and learn about that particular object as it pretains to Russian history, or culture.  The only thing that dissapointed me about the tour was that I would've liked to have seen more of the palace itself..but oh well.  And if you think that the Rasputin charater in the movie is creepy, you should reaseach the historical person, he's much creepier..trust me.

This movie is well worth your time and money, enjoy!!",1276646400,,1589,4.635714285714286
947641,3,6304872402,"Anastasia / B000CNE092

""Anastasia"" is an animated historical fiction of the ""alternate reality"" variety. Here, the impetus behind the brutal deposition of the Tsar and his family have less to do with social unrest and more to do with a magical curse levied by a disgruntled Rasputin, here voiced superbly by a frenetic Christopher Lloyd. Young, innocent Anastasia - a mere child at the time of this alternate reality overthrow - barely manages to escape the curse, losing her memory in the process, and grows up in a quick cutaway in an orphanage, dreaming of a better life. Fast forward several years and, in an astounding coincidence, the young Ana falls in with a duo of fraudsters hoping to pass the young woman off as the ""real thing"" in exchange for a reward from her mourning grandmother.

Along the way, audiences will be treated to the usual romantic subplot, a montage of musical songs that will stick in the brain as Ear Bugs but never attain the same level of classic status as, say, Disney musical songs of the same decade, and almost enough whimsy to offset the particularly dark and potentially frightening bits featuring Rasputin as an undead abomination with rotting bits constantly falling off. It is due to these frightening scenes, however, that this movie almost certainly won't enthrall very young children, and the movie lacks the staying power for older audiences. Older viewers will likely be tired by the predictable romantic subplot, and while the music is definitely catchy, the ethereal sadness underlying many of the songs may prevent their being sung again and again by audiences.

947670,4,6304872402,"One of my favorite elements of this movie is how this princess is portrayed.  My daugter who is 4 is absolutely obsessed with princesses!  I find Anastasia to be the most independent of all the major animated princesses, (all others being Disney princesses).  In Anastasia, there is actually a development of a relationship with the love interest, (Beauty and the Beast being the other notable example).  Also, though Anastasia is a princess, she ultimately decides that being one isn't the end all, be all of happiness.  I don't have a complete aversion to the other princesses.  But the theme of falling in love at first sight with almost exclusively princes gets old to me.  Not that everyone doesn't need to be saved from time to time by a ""knight in shining armor"", metaphorically speaking.  But I find it a refreshing interpretation that it come from an imperfect person that one actually knows more than a few hours.

The animation and music are great, too.  My only one real hesitation is with Rasputin.  He's a little on the gross side.  My daughter would obviously be more grossed out than an older child.  Nonetheless, as an adult, he still kind of gets to me.",1257206400,3,1171,4.737623762376238

This movie is very Romantic and yet keeps the kid friendly vibe, everyone in the family will enjoy it.

Yes, Rasputen is a very graphic character but any reviews of him ""scarring your children for life"" should be COMPLETELY disregarded as having a very wimpy child and nothing more.

However, finally watching this movie as a teenager I really wish I had seen it on th widescreen.

We have the tale of Anya- a ""nobody"" as she puts it, without a real name, past or family. Her only clue? A necklace with the words ""Together In Paris"" enscribed on it.

It's a beautifuly done movie, breathtaking animation- how can you NOT get shivers up and down your spine during the ""Once Upon A December"" scene? I know I can't. Rasputin in the cartoon looks rather like his historical counterpart, very, very creepy. I rather enjoyed how they made him ""Undead"" as in real life he was VERY hard to kill. (I don't remember HOW many times they attempted to kill Rasputin.)

Other than Rasputins looks, and several smaller details, the movie is largely historically unaccurate, but wonderful nontheless.

My one complaint? Sometimes Don's animation goes.... funny when he's trying to animate humans from a particular point of view. It could be just me, but I think he has that problem in ALL his animated films. (With the possible exception of ""Titan AE"")

Expert vocal work by Angela Lansbury (Dowager Empress), Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Kusack (Dimitri) and many others, make the characters seem more dimensional than in most animated features. Particularly Dimitri and Anastasia, whose love-hate relationship seems startlingly real given the superb animation.

The score is studded with some Oscar-nominated music and the sinister moments have the kind of villain you love to hate (Rasputin). Some of the scenes might be too intense for small children--as well as a realistic railway scene on a runaway car--but all in all, should delight young and old.

I originally received th VHS version back in April of 1998 and had almost worn my tape out from watching the movie so much. I happened to think ""I wonder if I can find Anastasia on DVD"" and at that moment was passing by the only copy in the store.

The movie is great, but not historically accurate. It's a kid's movie, not a history lesson, so keep that in mind if you plan to purchase this. I won't summarize the story but I will say that this movie is easily my Favorite 2D animated movie. Fox did a beautiful job on this and even almost 10 years later I am greatly in love with this movie.

The DVD set contains 2 Discs and has a lovely menu. The only thing that isn't beautiful is the cover which is a hideous malnourished rendering of Anastasia.

Also the bear is voiced by the same guy who voiced Vlad in the movie (I can't remember his name). He's a great singer which just adds to the movie.

Although it does not follow the factual history of what happened to Anastasia Romanov and her family it is a heart warming tale of courage, love and a quest to find something that was lost but eventually found.

The voice talents throughout the film include those of John Cusack, Meg Ryan and Kirsten Dunst.

With this double disc edition it also features 'The Sequel' Bartok The Magnificent but buyers beware this does not centre around Anastasia at all it is quite a poor attempt at a children's film not that you could expect greatness from a direct to video animated feature.

So if viewers want to buy it for the magical movie Anastasia and wish to view special features regarding it, I support your decision 100%  But don't buy it just because of the fact of having the poorly done sequel accompanying it.

947966,5,6304872402,"Plot in a nutshell - at the beginning of the 20th century, Russia is thrown into chaos when Czar Nicholas and most of his family is killed thanks to a curse by the evil ""sorcerer"" Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd), but one daughter, Anastasia (voiced by Kirsten Dunst as a child), manages to survive, for better or worse, but with amnesia. Years later, the adult Anastasia (voiced by Meg Ryan, once of one of Hollywood's most sought after actresses, her career now in a state of severe disrepair thanks to her much over publicized fling with Russell Crowe), known only as Anya, is released from a Russian orphanage with no memory of her past, her only clue being a necklace with an intimate message written on it that indicates Paris as a place of importance. In trying to get to Paris, she falls in with two charmingly lovable scoundrels, Dmitri (voice of John Cusack) and Vlad (Kelsey Grammar); the two con-men intend to present an ""Anastasia"" lookalike to the Duchess (voice of Angela Lansbury), the last surviving member of the Royal Family, who is holding meetings with girls claiming to be Anastasia in hopes of finding the real one so that they can get the reward money she's offering. Initially unaware that Anya is the real Anastasia but merely assuming that she is an uncanny lookalike, Dmitri & Vlad decide to clean Anya up and present her to the Duchess. Along the way, long buried secrets are revealed and unexpected feelings arise as the nearly dead Rasputin and his bat sidekick Bartok try to destroy the trio.

Beautifully animated feature courtesy of Don Bluth, you'd almost swear this was one of the great Disney features. Strong animation is complimented by competent voice acting by the big stars, notably Meg Ryan throwing out her perkiest voice possible. Historically inaccurate, but who cares?",1159056000,3,1820,4.852090032154341
947967,5,6304872402,"I first saw this movie when it orginally came out in the theaters. The first thing that grabbed me was the animation. Some of scenes are just so stunning, and moved as if there were actual cameras moving around (ex. Anya on the staircase as she first enters the palace, the Dowager Empress entering the car as Dimitri slips in to drive). The cast is great, Meg Ryan is perfect as Anastasia, and the songs are wonderful.

I was somewhat surprised to find out that it was not a Disney film, but done by Fox. However, I think that was because it reminds you of the films that were made in Disney's Golden Era (Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast) rather than the stuff they've made since.

The only thing I did not like is the scene/song of Rasputin in what I assume is some sort of Purgatory since they refer to him as dead, but he can still come to Earth and attempt to kill Anastasia. It is pointless, and a little creepy to have him singing and dancing with demonic creatures. I fast forward through that scene every time, and the rest of the movie is great.

Finally, I love the dabbling into Russian history. Here is an animated story with some meat to the story! It goes much further than a love story, dealing with the Russian revolution and including real-life people such as Rasputin--though they obviously took liberties with the events. The song set in Paris is great, with many ""cameos"" by famous people that the parents watching the movie would know. It also delves into the realites of growing up as an orphan and wanting that place to belong.

Together, they all go on the journey expecting to find what they're looking for, but on the way there, they face many challenging obstacles, growing closer together all the time. Even a little romance between the travelers comes in that threatens both their lives and having them never actually getting what they traveled the long way for.

948019,5,6304872402,"When I first watched Anastasia as a young child of eight, it didn't take much for me to fall in love with the movie.  A romantic sap even then, I appreciated the skillfully written plotline and couldn't care less about the historical accuracy - or rather, complete disregard for historical accuracy.

After a couple of years, I outgrew typical Disney animation (which this movie isn't, by the way - it's Fox, their first animated feature) and lumped Anastasia along with that.  Somehow, however, it got saved when we sold the majority of our animated films in our garage sale, and three years later on a whim I popped our dusty VHS copy into our VCR...and fell in love with it all over again.

The movie deals with the still-vibrant theory that, when the Bolcheviks under Lenin overtook Russia and executed the imperial family, the youngest daughter, Anastasia, survived.  In this film, the Russian Revolution is set in the year 1916, with an eight-year-old Anastasia; already, the historical inaccuracies are present.  It shows how Anastasia was able to escape the rebels who had come to kill her family, but has her falling to a train platform and losing her memory while still in St. Petersburg.  Ten years later, she winds up an amnesiac orphan, who is picked up by a pair of conmen to pose as Anastasia for reward money offered by Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie; of course, none of them know that she is the true Anastasia.  It's fairly easy to guess what happens next.

The film follows a basic formula and includes the necessary romance, soul-seeking journey, and, of course, comically evil villain with equally comical sidekick.  However, the way the story is presented is what makes it unique; the animation is fabulous and the heroine is intelligent and spunky.  Some of the songs are fairly unremarkable, save the hauntingly beautiful ""Once Upon a December"" and the inspiring ""Journey to the Past"", but the score is beautifully well done.  The plotline is strung together well and the romance is mature and believable.

Most complaints that I've heard about this movie is that it's very much a fictitious story and that children are confused when their parents say it's true.  However, that doesn't act as a critique for the movie or its creators, but rather for the parents who cannot coherently convey to their children the difference between fact and fiction.  The filmmakers have created a beautiful journey from a tragic history, and while it's highly unlikely that this truly happened, it's nice to suspend disbelief for awhile and pretend that the princess does always live happily ever after.",1154649600,2,2631,4.934240362811791

948021,5,6304872402,"Looking back at all the childhood cartoon movies I had, I realize that Anastasia ranks among my favorites. It has a couple of faults, but I loved it and I still do.

There are two primary faults to the movie. Firstly, the animation struggles at times with capturing particular human expressions. Secondly, it is not clever historical fiction because of the sacrifices it had to make over facts.

However, I believe this movie to be greater than the sum of its parts. The songs were amazingly wonderful. The development between Anastasia and Dimitri pulls at heartstrings. The mystic Rasputin arouses the disdain only proper for a movie villian. This is altogether a wonderful movie I would like to own on DVD.",1153440000,,709,4.851239669421488

Many other reviewers dislike this movie because of its inaccuracy to history, but in reality... Disney's the Little Mermaid was not true to Hans Christian Anderson's story, nor was Aladdins or many others.  Overall, if you want an entertaining story with romance, action, humor, great music, and a overall heart-felt theme (finding where you belong) then this movie is for you.",1152316800,4,562,5.021505376344086

this show has REALLY catchy music which is greatly sung and orchestrated...so if u watch it as a disney musical is supposed to be watched (no background, not caring if it's corny at times etc.) then you will love it...if you overanalyze it by going into how it's not historically accurate you will not like this movie at all....but if u watch it like you would Cats or Lion King (because animals can't really sing and talk :P ) then you will ADORE this movie!!",1150761600,4,769,4.572463768115942
948024,5,6304872402,"This warm and romantic film from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has long been my favorite animated feature. This mostly fictional story of Russia's famous Anastasia and her search for her family is sprinkled with humor and great songs. The animation, from snowy Russia to glamorous Paris, is top-notch and the story is both heartwarming and fun.

A great cast of voices, including Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Cusack (Dimitri), Kelsey Grammer (Vladimir), Christopher Lloyd (Rasputin), and Angela Lansbury as Anastasia's beloved grandmother add depth to an enchanting film. Anastasia wants to leave Russia for Paris because the necklace she wears has the inscription, ""Together in Paris,"" which she is sure holds the key to her journey to discover who she is and where she belongs.

Dimitri and Vladimir plan to pass her off as the real Anastasia for the reward in exchange for her visa out of Russia. The banter between Anastasia and Dimitri masks a growing attraction, of course, and when Dimitri discovers before she does that she really is Anastasia he knows he must step aside.

Complicating matters is the evil Rasputin, who has placed a curse on her family and sold his soul to destroy them. His little fruit bat, Bratok (Hank Azaria), is a very funny creation and turns out to be not so evil at all.

The story is peppered throughout with great songs, including ""Journey to the Past"" and the haunting ""Once Upon a December."" Anastasia is warm and involving, separating it from other animated films. When Anya discovers she really is Anastasia, it is bittersweet, as she now must choose between her past and her future. Love may conquer all, but not if the evil Rasputin has his way.

This is a heartfelt and funny animated feature you'll want to own and watch over and over. This particular edition comes with lots of extras for hours of family fun. Don't miss this one.",1150329600,68,1871,4.834375
948025,4,6304872402,"This is a really good movie by 20th Century Fox. I think it could have been better but it certainly has gotten alot of younger people interested in Russian history. This movie is based on the 1956 film which was adapted from a popular play of the time by Marcelle Maurette. The play was based on the real life of Anna Anderson, a woman who may or may not have been the Grand Duchess Anastasia as she claimed until her death in 1984. The film starts with a young Anastasia who, during the Russian Revolution brought on by the evil Rasputin character, escapes with her grandmother from the seige of the palace through a hole in the wall. Anastasia hits her head during a hard fall however and is seperated from her grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie.

Ten years later, in 1926, rumors float around St. Petersburg that the youngest daughter of the former Tsar is still alive. We are then taken to an orphanage with a young girl named Anya who has no memory of her past except for a necklace with the words, 'Together in Paris'. The young girl then sets off on a journey to discover who she really is.

The best part of the movie is without a doubt when Anya enters the Palace and sees the images of the dead Imperial Family dancing around to 'Once Upom A December'. I certainly reccomend this movie.",1149379200,2,1300,4.435146443514644

First of all, of course the grown ups know that this movie of Anastasia isn't the true story about what REALLY happened in real life.  ITS A KIDS MOVIE--IF U DONT LIKE IT PLEASE MOVE ONTO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE MORE ADULT-LIKE TO YOU.  But anyway, though this movie is false, not like the real details of what really happened in the early 19 hundreds, this is a kids movie.  I know the kids would probably question of the movie and compare or disagree with what really happen as they get older...that is the point.  A movie like this will strive them into learning more and more in school so they ask questions to know what REALLY HAPPENED.  Thats all i have to say.  Anyone agree?

~*~MESSAGE TO THE KIDS:~*~

Enjoy the movie!!!",1147305600,,764,4.478260869565218
948088,4,6304872402,"PLEASE BE AWARE:  The lovely cover image you see on Amazon is actually from the first DVD release of this movie.  If you order this product, you will receive something that looks like <a href=""[...]"">this</a>. (Unfortunately.)

Despite the horrible artwork on the cover, this DVD set is by far one of the best 2-disk special editions I have ever seen. The movie is presented in its original widescreen cinemascope glory with sparkling menus, tons of extras, a tour of the castle, and a bonus movie. If it only had a concept art gallery, I would put it all the way up there with the Disney Platinum Editions.

The first disk makes use of a map of Anya's journal to Paris as the main menu integrated with clips from the movie. It also has something the Disney DVDs have been lagging on lately--a commentary. A commentary, no doubt, with Don Bloth and Gary Goldman, the two masterminds behind this film and many other animated masterpieces.

Aside from that, the first disk also contains bonus features on how to draw four of the main characters in the movie. Now, most ""how"" to draw features start out with a perfect drawing of a character and then show three steps, each with perfectly matching lines and expect you to do exactly the same thing, which is simply ridiculous. This one was different, though. Don Bluth hosted four beautiful art sessions talking very realistically about how real artists do it, from 6B pencils to kneaded erasers to the fact that it's okay to make mistakes. He went through the process step by step and amazingly, his drawings looked very sketchy and none looked exactly like the character he was drawing. I thought this was wonderful because it teaches that not all drawings come out perfect at first and even the best artists don't just sit down, put their pencil to the paper, and have a perfect picture magically appear. The only thing I didn't like about this feature was that you had to click Continue after each step or it would just stay paused.

The other main feature on the disk was a singalong track containing songs from various older 20th Century Fox movies and hosted by a girl claiming to be Anastasia, but sounding nothing like her older or younger voices. The funny thing is, most of the songs on this track had absolutely nothing to do with Anastasia. In fact, I was surprised they expected kids to buy this DVD and know about these old movies such as Young Frankenstein, Shirley Temple, and many others including songs from the other newly rereleased animated Fox ""Family Fun Edition"" DVD, Fern Gully. Despite having little to do with the film, this 45-minute singalong track felt complete enough to sell on its own without any other attachments so it was a very hearty feature.

The second disk had the must unenthusiastic narrator I have ever heard in my life. Never the less, the disk's menu is a beautiful CGI tour of the Romanov palace. Each shelf contained objects that the real Anastasia might have had along with a description of their use and place in history. Some objects turned out to be games and others were more bonus features.

The meat of the disk was a 45-minute documentary about the making of the film. It was very nice to hear from all the voice artists and other people involved, but the best part came from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's commentary. Those two men always know exactly what to say! Their honest, straightforward, and down to earth nature really made this DVD a gem to own. They have no intention of playing down to a young audience and are clearly very passionate about what they do. It was always wonderful to hear their insights on the movie and the art of animation in general and they really made this set worthwhile.

Among the other features on the disk were a music video of Aaliyah's rendition of ""Journey to the Past,"" a trivia game with questions that were not too easy, but not too hard about the film, and a virtual paper doll of Anastasia. There was also a multi-language reel of ""Journey to the Past"" and ""Once Upon a December,"" preceeded by a list of phonetic letters. The ""karoake"" section of the reel was extremely tedious because it would first show Anya singing a line in one language, followed by two girls who were being used as examples of how phonetic letters are pronounced repeating that line, then the line was played without singing so ""you"" could sing it in that language, and then Anya would sing it one more time and these four cuts would repeat for every line in the song in every different language. Fortunately you also have the option of just watching the multi-language song reel by itself without the girls or karaoke versions.

Now we come to the icing on the cake. Not only do you get the movie Anastasia in this set, but you also get its spin-off film, Bartok the Magnificent, absolutely free! This 60-minute film is too long to be a short, but too short to be a movie and isn't really worth buying by itself. However, considering that it's free, it's quite a worthwhile bonus feature indeed! With a unique story, original musical numbers, and everyone's favorite pink and white bat, it's sure to entertain for at least one sitting even if you never want to watch it again after that. The movie has nothing to do with Anastasia, but instead involves Bartok trying to rescue the kidnapped prince of Moscow. There are unfortunately no cameos of anyone else in Anastasia, but nevertheless, it's a cute flick.

At $10 on Amazon, this DVD is an absolute steal and anyone in their right mind should grab it the first chance they get. Not only do you get a gorgeous and expertly crafted film, but you also get a SingAlong movie, a second spin-off movie, games, historical references, and beautifully insightful commentary from the ever-devoted, ever-friendly Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. The princess Anastasia has truly returned to her rightful throne. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars is because of the cover art.",1143849600,165,5947,4.659675881792183
948089,2,6304872402,"That's the best way I can describe this film. Don Bluth created 2 films that I absolutely loved as a kid: An American Tail and Land Before Time(I still quote that ""mother, what's a looooong neck?"" line). So watching Anastasia you think, ooh, another one. Just too bad that's not the case since not only did they mess around a bit with history but it just smacks of trying to outdo Disney instead of just telling a good story.

The film centers around Anastasia who escapes a siege in her castle. She loses her memory and becomes Anya and meets Dimitri, the grown up boy who saved her from the castle. He's been training would-be Anastasia's to collect prize money but he finds the real one and has to travel to Paris from Russia to reunite her with her grandmother.

One of the most infamous mysteries in history, let alone Russian history, is what happened to Anastasia, the daughter of Czar Nicholas the 2nd. During the Revolution, Anastasia supposedly escaped and details are wild saying she was bayoneted many times, others say she went to Germany and became Anna Anderson which turned out to be false. The film says that not only did Anastasia survive but actually made it to Paris and all was well.

It's a very interesting story with many ways to go about it but this is quite something. Unlike other films which takes creative liberties to make a better story/pacing, this film throws history out the window entirely. Not to fault the film for wanting to tell a fuller story but it's practically rewriting history. For starters, Rasputin didn't start the Revolution, Lenin did. And Rasputin was actually assasinated way before it began.

What made other animated films that had musical numbers was that they were catchy. Here they seem kind of a hindrance, there's literally a moment where not even 2 minutes pass and we're ""treated"" to another song. It would be ok if they were memorable but I can't remember anything about them at this point.

One thing that I can't fault the film on is the animation and voice acting. The animation for the most part works, especially backgrounds. Never did like the character designs though since they look kind of ugly, especially Anastasia. The voice acting is quite top notch though featuring Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammar and Christopher Lloyd as well as Hank Azaria.

If you want notable Bluth films, watch American Tail and Land Before Time but if you want check this film out too but I didn't enjoy it as much.",1141257600,5,2471,4.695150115473441

The acting could be much better, including both the voice acting, and the non-verbal expressions in the animation. My biggest critique of the movie though is the Ras Putin subplot. The real villain in this movie was deception, and it almost conquered the hearts of the protagonists. Without the little demon fairies, the evil sorcerer, this movie could have been amazing.

The family, the history, the unhappily ever after that still consumes Russia even to this day and how it cries out for the Royal family to take it's rightful place. Anastasia however is the real mystery. Whatever happend to the young girl everyone wants to know. Did she die? Perhaps. Did she live on? We hope. Did she find peace? We dream. However as we all know life is not like that. So for the hopeful romantics, and dreamers the disney version Anastasia is the movie for you.

It holds everything that we wish was real. That the young girl survived, lived, had adventure and found her way back to her grandmama as well as defeating the evil Rasputin! Meg Ryan portrays her beautifuly by giving Anastasia spirit, independence, and that thirst for life that we can all relate too. Even now as I watch mesmerized by the characters, the dialog and the over all picture its self I can only imagen what happend, what should of been and the little princess that never got her happy ending.

This movie even though changed by adults to fit in the world of the childs mind. Is in my opinion the happy ending to the lost princess Anastasia should should have had.

The characters are so amiable, from adorable Bartok and dashing Dmitri to fiery Anya and coquettish Sophia. The songs are beautiful and catchy, and will stick in your head for days as you run around humming them with a smile on your lips - not surprising, as they were done by the renowned team of Flaherty & Ahrens, who wrote other such greats as Ragtime, Once On This Island, and Seussical.

Things that stick out... I love the characters, the way they look, and the reluctant love story that blossoms-- great chemistry for animated characters!  The animation is unforgettable.  The three major action sequences were great, especially the train wreck-- wow.

I always believed in the stories of Anastasia, but I was sad when I learned the truth about her and her family. If this movie was real, it would really convince me that Anastasia would be a true princess.

The story begins in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1916, as a ball is being held in honor of the 300th anniversary of the ruling of the czars of Russia. One of the guests is the Dowager Emperess Marie (Angela Lansbury, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Murder, She Wrote, Beauty and the Beast), who loves her youngest granddaughter, Anastasia (Kirsten Dunst, Jumanji, Mona Lisa Smile, Spiderman). The emperess is leaving for Paris, which makes Anastasia sad. So, the emperess gives her granddaughter a music box to remember her by, as well as a necklace that reads ""Together in Paris"". The party is interuppted when Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd, Angels in the Outfield, Taxi; sung by Jim Cummings, the voice of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger), an evil holy man, sends a curse upon the Romanov family that they will die within the night. After the party, the revolution begins, and the Romanovs are trying to escape. Anastasia forgets her music box and runs off to her room, with her grandmother running close behind her. Suddenly, the protesters burst into the castle! A small servant boy helps the princess and the grandmother into a special door hidden in the wall so that they could escape. Rasputin meets the two on the ice, where he is sure that Anastasia could not escape. But then, the ice breaks, and Rasputin drowns to his death. By the time Anastasia and Marie get to the train station, the train is already leaving! Marie gets on, but Anastasia is running as fast as she can so she could get on, too. Marie grabs onto her granddaughter's hand, but it slips from her grasp, and Anastasia falls. Since then, Marie has been searching for granddaughter, but all she finds are frauds. Can she ever see her granddaughter again?

10 years have passed since the revolution, and a rumor has been started that Anastasia is alive, and the Dowager Empress Marie is offering 10 million rubles to anyone who can bring Anastasia to her. Two men, Dmitri (John Cusack, Must Love Dogs, America's Sweethearts) and Vladmir (Kelsey Grammar, Frasier, Cheers) are willing to take that chance, but only for the money since they are con men, or those who use fake people to pretend they are a real person. Meanwhile, at an orphanage, an 18 year old girl named Anya (Meg Ryan, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail) is sent off to go get a job at the fish factory. She has no memory of her past, except a necklace that reads ""Together in Paris"". She can't shake off the feeling that she may be someone special. Anya doesn't know what to do. Then, a little encouragement from a stray dog leads her to St. Petersburg, where she decides to get a ticket to go to Paris. But she has no exit visa, which she can't get a ticket. So then, she goes off to the old palace to seek out a man named Dmitri. While exploring the palace, she imagines herself at a ball, dancing in the arms of those who love her, feeling safe and warm. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Dmitri and Vladmir appears. As Anya tries to run away, but is stopped by Dmitri, who looks at her while standing at the painting of the Russian family. She looks a lot like Anastasia. Anya tells her story to the two men, who want to help her get to Paris, but the third ticket is reserved for Anastasia. Then, they try to convince her that she could be the princess. Anya catches on, and agrees to go with them. But, unknowingly, a bat named Bartok (Hank Azaria, The Simpsons, Bartok the Magnificent) watches from above, and realizes that Anastasia is alive. The reliquary, which belonged to Rasputin, plunges down to the underworld, taking Bartok with it. When he tells Rasputin that Anastasia is alive, he is enraged and vows to kill the remaining member of the Romanov family. Will Rasputin get his revenge? Is Anya really Anastasia? And what will Dmitri and Vladmir do if they get the rubles?

This movie is fantastic. I loved every minute of it, except the part where Anastasia learns that Dmitri is a con man. The songs are simply lovely. I love Aaliyah's version of ""Journey to the Past"". She did a great job. I'm sorry to see her go unexpectedly. I also liked ""At the Beginning"" by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis. And a big shout-out to the composers. They rock!

It doesn't matter if this movie is historically correct or not. It matters that you learn a big lesson from it. A couple, actually. The main lesson is follow your heart. It will guide you to your true heart's desires. Buy Anastasia today! The special features of this DVD are good, too. It's a real journey to the past!",1122940800,5,4884,4.5592255125284735

Maybe not as great as it could be, but the haunting song ""Once upon a December"" alone is worth the price of the disc.

And that is exactly what it is: a movie for CHILDREN. It's supposed to be FUN, not teach you history. If you want to see a portrait for the political struggles in Russia at that time - go read a book about it!
Yes, the movie's characters are portrayed as black and white - the Romanovs are good, Rasputin is bad. Has it ever been different in Disney movies (yes, I do realize this is not a Disney movie)? Yes, maybe Lenin would've made a more logical bad guy, but Lenin didn't have magic powers (as far as that goes, Rasputin is the way more interesting character). Why yes, maybe they should have portrayed the hardships of revolution and the two years that the Romanov family had been held captive. Why YES, maybe they should have made Alexei a sickly boy and the whole thing utterly hopeless. It would have been more realistic and appealing to all you fine members of the politically aware adults. But no seven-year-old (as I was at the time I watched this movie) would be particularly interested in that kind of story.
As to my personal opinion, I love this movie. The songs (""Once Upon a December"" is beautiful), the characters, the dialogue, the graphics, the mood, everything is just stunning. Sometimes it gets a little mushy, I suppose, as in the starting scene - but those parts are easy to overlook when viewing the wonderful whole.",1122249600,3,1588,4.595070422535211

948195,5,6304872402,"This warm and romantic film from Don Bluth and Gary Goldman has long been my favorite animated feature. This mostly fictional story of Russia's famous Anastasia and her search for her family is sprinkled with humor and great songs. The animation, from snowy Russia to glamorous Paris, is top notch and the story is both heartwarming and fun.

A great cast of voices, including Meg Ryan (Anastasia), John Cusack (Dimitri), Kelsey Grammer (Vladimir), Christopher Lloyd (Rasputin) and Angela Lansbury as Anastasia's beloved grandmother add depth to an enchanting film. Anastasia wants to leave Russia for Paris because the necklace she wears has the inscription, ""Together in Paris,"" which she is sure holds the key to her journey to discover who she is and where she belongs.

Dimitri and Vladimir plan to pass her off as the real Anastasia for the reward in exchange for her visa out of Russia. The banter between Anastasia and Dimitri masks a growing attraction, of course, and when Dimitri discovers before she does that she really is Anastasia he knows he must step aside.

Complicating matters is the evil Rasputin, who has placed a curse on her family and sold his soul to destroy them. His little fruit bat Bratok (Hank Azaria) is a very funny creation and turns out to be not so evil at all.

The story is peppered throughout with great songs, including ""Journey to the Past"" and the haunting ""Once Upon a December."" Anastasia is warm and involving, separating it from other animated films. When Anya discovers she really is Anastasia, it is bittersweet, as she now must choose between her past and her future. Love may conquer all, but not if the evil Rasputin has his way.

This is a heartfelt and funny animated feature you'll want to own and watch over and over. Don't miss this one.",1119744000,3,1793,4.808441558441558
948196,4,6304872402,"First of all, unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not think the historical inaccuracy of this film constitutes a problem.  All historical movies are inaccurate to some extent, and this particular film does not purport to reconstruct historical events, but rather to play on a fantasy, on an interesting rumour.  What I did find rather problematic was the fact that we are supposed to identify with the Romanov family, that is to say, to endorse power, tyranny, and aristocracy, at the expense of harsh social realities. We are supposed to feel regret over the lost splendor of the Romanov court, when most Russians did not live like this. Retrospectively, the Russian revolution brought misery and suffering to many, but the idea that one is supposed to sympathize with the czar's family and their plight seems to me problematic.

Having said that, the film in itself is quite good though. The animation is flawless, the songs are OK, though only the theme song, Once Upon A December, is great, and the title character is very likable. I enjoyed watching the development of the relationship between Anastasia and Dmitry. However, there were some weak links in the plot, such as the fact that Dmitry and his companion are defined as complete crooks at first, and suddenly we learn that actually they're great human beings.  Not that this is implausible, but I thought the transition from one state to another was too abrupt.  I would have liked to see a gradual development in their characters.

Personally, I did not like the white bat character, which, to my taste at least, failed to provide the comic relief it was intended for. I also disliked Rasputin, whose character I felt made no sense in this context, nor do I think is it clear to the unitiated viewer who he is. I did not find him believable as a character posing an obstacle for the heroine, and I think a more realistic solution, such as, I don't know, real bolsheviks pursuing Anastasia, would have worked better.

Nevertheless, if one can get over these weak spots, the movie is quite enjoyable, and overall I indeed liked it, because:

The Anastasia character is credible and I liked her throughout; she is beautifully dubbed by Kirsten Dunst (as an 8 year old) and then by Meg Ryan (as the 18 year old Anastasia);

""Once Upon a December"" is a very good song, and I liked the use of it to express nostalgia, or as an aid to memory;

The theme of lost and recollected memory is very well treated;

The opening, with the dowager empress's voiceover, is strong;

The animation is fantastic.

Despite all its faults, the movie is definitely watchable, entertaining, and worthy of repeated viewings.",1116547200,,2666,4.769565217391304
948230,5,6304872402,"When I was little this was my favorite movie I had the Anatasia Barbies, C.D., saw the ice show, had a stuffed Pooka and computer games. Now even as a teen I still get a kick out of watching this flick.

Taking place after the Russian Revolution in St. Petersberg Dimitri a street rat trys to pull off the biggest scam in history by hiring an imposter to claim that she is the long lost Czarress Anatasia of Russia. Well, this is when young Anya comes into play being an orphan who was recently released with no recolection of her family-she's on a search to find them. When, she accidently bumps into Dimitri. Dimitri sees a resemblance to the long lost Anatasia and decides to use Anya(Anya dosn't know his plan). Well, only 2 problems an evil Rasputin is following Anya trying to make certain she dosn't succeed by putting curses and demons in her way and she is falling in love with Dimitri. When, Dimitri and Anya finally arrive in Paris to pull of the scheme- Dimitri realizes that Anya really is Anatasia and that he must never see her again.

This movie may not be historical accurate but what do expect when you watch an animated movie??? With an all-star voice over cast and done in the time of classic animation this movie will never go out of style. I still enjoy watching it and I find myself missing the days of the less high-tech animation style. The music in this is also touching, I own the soundtrack and I love the song ""Once Upon A December."" With a great cast, good script, and great animation(even if it's not Disney) One of the greatest animated movies ever made-this is not a movie that should be missed on family movie night- Rent or buy this one and go on a journey to the past!",1113264000,2,1704,4.406349206349207
948231,5,6304872402,"While Anastasia may never become a classic in the hearts of some people you will find that this film will take a special place in your heart as you witness a young woman, 18 years old lost and alone and just trying to find her place in an unforgiving world.

Anastasia is based of the true story of the Bolzchevic Revolution where the Czars of Russia were overthrown and killed.  It was believed that the princess anastasia survived due to the fact that her body was unaccounted for among her relatives.  It was thought to believe that she was found but actually the woman, now dead, was proved to be a fake when Anastasia's bones were finally found after the imposters death.  This woman tho did not know she was an imposter because she had amnesia and did not know whether or not she was actually anastasia.

While the movie takes its own spin on this tale, it is still fun and facinating to watch as the evil Rasputin, a real character in history who was believed to posses dark powers, tries endlessly to fulfill his curse of killing the Romanove (unsure of spelling) family by killing the sole survivor, Anastasia.  This film is to be considered a musicle due to all the songs in it but it should be noted that these songs, unlike most in disney and other kid films, are not horrible and make you want to plug your ears....these songs are heartfelt and made for all listeners young and old.  My favorite song is ""One Step at A time"" where Anastasia is travleing to St. Peterspurg to begine her search for her family.

Another great aspect of this film is that it has a wonderful vioce cast that helps contribute to the magic of the film...such actors are as follows...Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, and Angela Lansbury.  Each actor does an excelant job at helping the film come to life before your eyes and show that they not only know how to act on screen in real life, but to animated character with out making it sound fake and hollow.  They are extremly enjoyable to listen to.

I encourage you to buy Anastasia, its the perfect animated film for anyone in the family who dreams that perhaps, they were actually born a princess.",1112745600,5,2177,4.528061224489796
948232,5,6304872402,"This is a classic movie.  Yes, ""classic"" has been overused by Disney, but I want you to know that this IS a TRUE classic.  It's right up there with Snow White.

The animation was so astounding I can't even attempt to put it in words.  The 3D and 2D mesh isn't as good in some places as one would like it to be, but (a) it was 1997 and (b) we still can't pull it off now in 2005!  If this isn't amazing animation, then what IS?

The music was as good or (dare I even say it?) possibly even BETTER than the animation.  ""Once Upon a December"" is just.......  It's useless to describe it.  Words cannot express how mysterious and haunting and amazing and joyous and creepy and astounding every second of listening to it is.  The rest of the songs, while not quite as good, are still enjoyable.

And the writing...Oh, the writing was fantastic.  To those of you who wanted a historically accurate Anastasia, I have two words for you: TOUGH BEANS.  Did you REALLY expect a historically accurate Anastasia.  and besides, the rest of the movie is so amazing that you HAVE to just let it go.  Every scene was exactly what it was supposed to be--take the dream sequence.  It was SO darn creepy seeing the reality played against what was happening in Anya's mind, it was just-----insane.  Completely and totally IN-SANE!  DO YOU HEAR ME! ALL OF IT IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE AND POWERFUL AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!!!!!

Bottom line:  If you are an inhabitant of our universe (preferably above age 5, but that's okay too), you should watch this movie.",1110067200,3,1539,4.487364620938628

Even though it has not been proven that Anastasia was still alive... and even though the movie never mentioned that Aleixi's body was also missing not just Anastasia... it was still a great movie, with fabulous songs. Definately not recommended for small children due to frightening scenes... unless of course the children are already corrupted... then by all means.",1108512000,2,592,4.813725490196078

Plus, it's an interesting twist, that Vladimir caused the Russian Revolution.

Anyway... how do I put this? I LOVE this movie.  I think that there was one summer where I watched it two times a week.  Anasasia and Dmitri are one of the cutest animated couples ever; they had real chemistry!  Plus it was so cute how he was a servant and she was a princess.  Anyway, the reason that I like this movie so much is instead of some crazy plot device that allows a ""commoner"" and royalty to marry, the girl has to choose between being a princess and marrying whom she wants.  I like the message better.

Marie Romanov, the Dowager Empress of Russia had come to say goodbye before leaving to go to Paris. To make the separation more bearable, she had a music box made for Anastasia to sing her to sleep at night. It seemed as though it were the perfect evening, but suddenly a dark cloud loomed over the palace and Rasputin - who had been banished by the royal family - entered the party. He set a curse upon the Romanovs saying they would all die within the fortnight. Panic arose throughout the palace and the Romanovs ran for their lives. Separated from the family, Anastasia and her Grandmother ran to the train station to escape. Anastasia could not keep up and soon was lost on the streets of St. Petersburg and thought dead throughout all of Russia.

Ten years later, a rumor arises that Anastasia is alive. We meet Dimitri and Vladimir who are planning to find a girl to pretend to be Anastasia so they can recieve the large reward from the Dowager Empress, Marie. They find Anya - a young woman who is seaching for her past with only one clue: Paris. They convince her to come with them to Paris and meet Marie saying maybe she really is Anastasia and if so, she will have found her family at last. Rasputin realizes Anastasia is not dead and becomes furious. He sets off on a mission to kill her.

It is beautiful, with the voices perfectly in sync with the animation, and some beautiful songs like the exquisite Once Upon a December.
Meg Ryan really puts a cute voice to Anya, and Hank Azaria is really funny as the albino bat, in fact better than the much-overrated Robin Williams, in his similar roles in other animated movies.
The scene of the Christmas in the palace, with Kirsten Dunst reading the young Anastasia was really enchanting, and the whole adventure is a compelling epic. Kelsey Grammar and John Cusack play their roles also with aplomb, as the adventure across Europe to re-unite the  Anastasia (the orphan Anya)  with the Grand Duchess unfolds , all the while believing that they are just passing off a con!
 It is once of the best animated movies of all times, along with Prince of Egypt (1998) and Alice in Wonderland (1952) except... Why was Rasputin the chief villain? I mean I know that you can't expect too much historical accuracy from an animated movie, but there really was a Prime Evil in the story of Anastasia, the Romanovs and Russia:  and his name was Vladimir Illyich Lenin.

Rasputin had nothing to do with the murder of the Romanov family, but the Bolsheviks certainly where brutal and evil, beyond anything in any fairy tale, and their acolytes (eg Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky, the apologist of tyranny and terror). So why where such perfect villains almost completely left out of the movie?

Put in Lenin instead of Rasputin as the chief villain/devil role and now you have a classic! Or is it just not PC these days to go too hard on the Commies?",1098057600,,1674,4.715753424657534

I first heard about this movie ""Anastasia"" when it passed thru theaters in Nov'97, but I never got around to seeing it until the first week of Jan'98 - and I'd ended up missing like the first ten minutes of it, due to transportation issues. After the movie, my general thoughts were that it had been just good, and I went on with life, lol. But for some reason, it was about two weeks later, when I suddenly thought - ""That's an awesome movie!!!"" and I wanted to go back to it.

Then I was so annoyed that I couldn't remember most of it, so I tried to see it again, but it had already left all my local theaters. I spent the next few months, obsessing over anything that I could find about it, and the real story that it's based on, trying to remember every scene. I would even draw out scenes in a special binder that I had put together for the movie, along with pictures from various paper ads, and I also wrote and dreamt about it too. I counted down the days until it would finally come out on video - April 28, 1998, at which point of course I went right out and got it and started watching it over and over, practically memorizing every quote and song. I still have that same vhs even now, and I still think it's an awesome movie!

Now that I have the DVD, I love it too. You can check out a bit of how-they-made-it stuff, as well as the official trailer. Plus, you can choose what version to watch, widescreen or fullscreen - *all* movies on dvd should have that option!

Hope you enjoy this movie and thanks for reading ;D",1092096000,2,1568,4.182119205298013
948302,4,6304872402,"At the end of last week I had the opportunity to see Anastasia.  Due to the prevalence of magic and the changing of history, Anastasia does qualify as a fantasy film.
When the Russian empire falls (in a fortnight due to Rasputin's curse), young Anastasia escapes with her life but not her memory.  An old member of the court and an old member of the palace staff look for a girl they can pose as Anastasia in order to collect a reward.  The girl they pick turns out to be the genuine article.  After some harrowing adventures made more difficult by the efforts of Rasputin from beyond the grave, Anastasia is reunited with her grandmother.  Then, just as all obstacles and plot complications are out of the way of romance the final showdown with Rasputin occurs.
One of the main reasons I had wanted to see this film was that it was the first true challenge to Disney's animation empire.  I was very surprised to find out that Don Bluth (All Dogs Go To Heaven and other dogs) was behind the film.  Bluth seems to have finally figured out how to make a good film and Anastasia will hopefully not be the last.
There are a few faults (of course) with the overall plot and the dealings with history but if one accepts this as alternate history they are not a real problem.  For one, Rasputin dies by accident (although he does drown).  Anastasia is found and reunited with her family.  The Russian Empire is likened to Camelot where all is good for everyone.  Rubles seem to have worth outside of Russia.  But if you can handle that, you should have no problem with the story.  The only real problems I had with the production involved the musical numbers and the animation.  There was some good music but it just wasn't as clear as it should be.  Oftentimes one had to guess what the song was about.  The problem with the animation stems from to jarring an interface between the computer animation and the cell animation.  Hopefully these small problems can be eliminated in future projects.
So, overall I really enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun story with some old cliches eliminated (Tracy thinks they too a close look at the success of Buffy The Vampire Slayer).  The animation was beautiful, if jarring in a few spots.  The characters were likeable and believable and were backed by some excellent voice talents.  If you get a chance to see this one on a big screen you should take that opportunity; it's worth it.  If not, get the DVD.",1089763200,2,2437,4.5159817351598175
948303,3,6304872402,"This nice little story of the search for and recovery of the heir to the Russian throne.  It is full of adventures to keep the children interested but includes many complicated plots and subplots going on at the same time for the adults to enjoy.  When found, Anya was told she had the beauty of her mother, Alexandra; her father had been the last czar, Nicholas.
On the ship to France, curses were being thrown Anya's way by Rasputian.  She feels like she is falling apart.  A waif for many years, she is hoping to find her family and her destiny.  At the Effiel Tower, we saw a beautiful dancing water show similar to that at the downtown park in Chicago in summer.
The elderly Empress with her white hair has reached the point of despair and will no longer interview any of the many girls who claim to be Anastasia.  She had a cat with a fluffy tail.  Her maid Sophia, the blonde bombshell with Dolly Parton attributes, informs them of the Soviet ballet and takes them on a fantastic shopping spree.
Dimitri had been a servant lad in the palace and had led the group to safety during the revolution.  Now he has turned into a conman to find the heiress.  He is pictured with my son Geoffrey's hair and even his smile.  There is a model in Chicago who is Jeff's 'double' so it could have been based on him.
Out in the streets of Paris, there is dancing as in HAVANA NIGHTS cartoon style.  At the Moulin Rouge shaped like a windmill we see the can can dancers' show.
On the way to the ballet, we saw a huge statue of Rodin's THE THINKER.  Cinderella was the ending of the ballet; we did not see the beginning.  When confronted with Anya, she wearily inquires, ""How much pain will you inflict on an old woman?""  Now, she had decided to end her days with a lonely life in peace.  Dimitri carjacked the Empress to explain how and why he knows for sure this is the right Anastasia.  ""I know you've been hurt,"" he says, by his search for the young girl he had fallen in love with.
Anya had prayed, ""Please let her remember me.""  It was the thing she wore around her neck which opened the music box which was the deciding factor.  As we watched the music box dancers, we hear a lovely song, ""Once Upon a December.""
She had become bitter toward Dimitri when learning of his con game.  ""From the beginning, you lied,"" she'd proclaimed thinking he was just after the reward money.  Upon learning that he had refused the fortune due to a 'change of heart,' we see a bittersweet ""goodbye.""
The mutt was a good mood-changer.  He was so cute, as was the bat which Rasputian had who wished he would just 'get a life.'  He got his own at the end of this movie.
Anya was lured into a maze built around a beautiful fountain by evil forces.  She told Rasputain, the mad monk, ""I'm not afraid of you.""  He'd declared, ""What goes around comes around."" She is saved by Dimitri who had returned to claim her as his own and they destroyed his evil by tearing up the lighted skull.  Rasputain is turned into ashes after Dimitri had an encounter with a destructive Pegasus.
After she tells him that 'all men are babies,' they eloped.  Isn't that romantic?!  A perfect ending to a perfect beginning.

The songs work well except for the possible exceptions of the intro.  A guy singing in his underwear?  Whats up with that?  Did Rasputin really need singing bugs to back him up? No. Other than that I did enjoy the film. But I have to add this as a final note.  Did it have to be based on the life of Anastasia?  Couldn't it be reworked under a different name?

Story: Anastasia, her grandmother, and the rest of the Romanov family are enjoying a royal ball in their palace. But alas, there's always a bad guy,.......Rasputin in this case. He says that Anastasia's whole family will die soon, and that happens (off screen of course). Well, everybody except for Anastasia and her grandma. Her grandma escapes to Paris. ""Anya"" falls off a train, hits her head, and ends up in an orphanage. 10 years later, two conmen named Dimitri and Vladamer are ""collecting"" girls that look/act like Anastasia. This is because Marie (Anya's grandma) is holding a grand reward of 10 million rubels for anyone who finds her lost granddaughter. And Anastasia? She is finally released from the orphanage. But instead of going ""fishing"" like the lady at the orphanage tells her to, she goes to St. Petersburg to find her family. Following her is the undead Rasputin (ha, and you thought he was dead). He's trying to get revenge since Anya lived. The rest of the story follows the journey's of Anastasia, and how she finds her grandmama.
As for the historical record? Well, Rasputin was actually a ""friend of the family"" as you might call him. He helped to cure little Alex, Anastasia's brother, from a fever. From what I've heard, I guess Anya's whole family (including her) was killed. Not a very happy ending is it? Of course, they can't let the kids know this, so it's all ""re-arranged"". As for Pooka (the dog), who knows if the Romanov family had a dog or not. Dimitri? He looks suspiciously like Alex dosn't he? And what about Bartok (the bat)? Of course, he is purely fictional. I have to admit that he seemed like the main character more than Anya, since he had the most ""personality"". Kind of a cute little guy actually.

There was a song writer and lyricist who wrote all of the songs and they did an awesome job!  We bought the music CD after seeing the movie & we still listen to it.  The movie was great also (the Rasputin character was a little out there & seemed cartoonish, but every good movie has an evil bad guy.)  The detailed palace scenes and the rest of the movie was spectacular.  The rest didn't seem cartoonish at all, but very real.

Anyways, this fabulous (yet historically inaccurate!) film about the Russian princess is a grand story that elaborates on what happened to Anastasia when the palace was siezed.
The animation and writing is so bright and vibrant in Anastasia, you really may be convinced Disney made this film. (Yet they didn't!)
Meg Ryan is fantastic in voicing the lead. The musical is also great and never really gets on your nerves like the fast majority of animated musicals. Anastasia was just great.
This film can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone at any age. I loved Anastasia, even though the ending and beginning were a bit weak. It was just great!",1060732800,2,787,4.7101449275362315

The villan Rasputin is just as funny as his helper Bartok (the bat). It is hysterical watching and listening to the conversations the two of them have. With a wonderful and romantic ending the whole story is tied up in a bow. I highly suggest it to parents looking for a funny movie for their family.

Before he died, he wrote a note to the Czarina that if he was murdered they wouldn't last a year, and if he died of natural causes, the Romanovs would survive. He was murdered, and the Romanovs fell soon after. He wouldn't want to destroy the Romanovs. If anything, he would want to bring them back to power. Without the Romanovs, he was really nothing. He would rather have found Anastasia, killed Lenin, and restored her to power.

948394,3,6304872402,"I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, the story line was terrific, even though Rasputin was a bit scary at times. The songs were wonderful, and I especially liked ""At the Beginning"" (if that's the right name for the title.) The animation was superb, especially in the ""Once upon a December"" sequence. The characters were believeable and enjoyable, and I liked watching Anya's relationship with Dmitri go from constant bickering to genuine affection. The reunion with her grandmother was touching as well.
However, the historical inaccuracies in this film bothered me, especially since I've read a lot about the real Romanov family and know that their situation was nothing like what's portrayed in the film. I realize that this is a kid's movie, but I think the directors rearranged the facts a bit too much. To begin with, Anastasia was not a child when her family was murdered -- she was 17. The family's massacre took place in Siberia in 1918, not in St. Petersburg in 1916, as the film depicts. And Ansastasia's grandmother lived in Denmark, not Paris. Apparently the prouducers just thought Denmark wasn't impressive enough for a background setting.
Other than the distortion of historical facts, I enjoyed this film. I give it three stars.",1053302400,4,1280,4.930555555555555
948452,5,6304872402,"The story of the lost Romanov princess has become a legend in itself; captivating the interests of people worldwide. To mould such a story into an animated movie was certainly no easy task; but what directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman have achieved is an unique masterpiece you cannot help marvel at. The Little Mermaid had re-incarnated animation in 1989 and the following years saw a saga of animated hits from the mouse. But after the record breaking `Lion King' and acclaimed `Pocahontas', Disney began to lose its iron grip at the box-office. The rather disappointing Hercules did not help to hype up the position at all. Fox's first animated motion picture possesses a beauty and splendor comparable in every way to major Disney hits like Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King.
  It is dramatic yet spontaneous, humorous yet emotional; and although not historically very accurate, it indulges in a dramatic fictional narrative, combining an essence of traditional values and modern story-telling that give the movie a spectacular outlook. The visuals are extremely vibrant and poignant, with colorful spell-binding backgrounds in which are carefully blended the CGI sequences.  Stephen Flaherty's music is rich and deeply melodious. From the Broadway styled `Learn To Do It' to the Oscar nominated `Journey To The Past', the songs are indeed memorable and leave a lasting impression on your mind. The tune that lingers on and on is `Once Upon A December', its melody hauntingly beautiful and probing. And for those who love fast numbers, you will certainly adore the pop end title `At The Beginning' by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis.
  David Newman's score, although short, is simply one of the best to ever grace an animated movie; its emotional gravity so astoundingly deep and soul-searching that it makes you forget it is an animated movie you are watching. Newman was honored with his first Academy Award nomination for Anastasia. As to why he did not win remains a big mystery to me. Anne Dudley's The Full Monty, which eventually won the best Musical Score in 1997, is at best tolerable and certainly pales before Anastasia's heavenly appeal.
  Fox's voice cast comprises of renowned on-screen actors and actresses, who have delivered praiseworthy performances. Meg Ryan is enthusiastic, fiery and brings surprising life to the character of Anastasia . John Cusack portrays Dimitri, and his voice adds amazing warmth and glow to the lines of the male protagonist. Other talents include Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd, Bernadette Peters and Kirsten Dunst. The best role probably belongs to Angela Lansbury who puts excruciating depth in the character of Anastasia's grandma, the Dowager Empress Marie.
  The main highlight of the movie is its sentimental appeal, cleverly mixing the elements of heart, emotion, sacrifice and depth that is sure to conquer any romantic heart. I repeat, there are times which make you forget that it is an animated movie you are watching, not a real one. The re-union scene where the Empress Marie says ""Oh Anastasia My Anastasia!"" is voiced with such depth that it brings tears to the eyes. To imagine the joy of a woman who has lost her son and her whole family during a revolution, who has been hurt countless times by imposters, to finally know that her grandchild is still alive!
  Fox's DVD offers a 1.33:1 pan and scan as well as a 2.35:1 widescreen picture. The anamorphic transfer looks very crisp and colorful. The Dolby digital 5.1 sound makes good use of surround, nicely highlighting the score and special effects. The special features offer an in-depth look at the making. Also included are a featurette, two trailors, two sing-alongs and a puzzle game.
  An unique masterpiece, Anastasia has marvelous music and an excellent storyline which depicts two very strong women. The movie, though, is geared more at the mature audiences. Ten-year olds will hardly understand the emotional moments or the occasional verbal clashes between the two protagonists during the first half of the movie. I highly recommend it to people who truly appreciate artistic and emotional beauty. Anastasia stands as a classic to be cherished now and forever.",1052611200,4,4209,5.0914368650217705
948453,5,6304872402,"I was absolutely blown away when I saw this film! Fox has emulated Disney, not altering the formula but noticably increasing on the quality of the end result.
The storytelling is magnificent. Naturally it is not historically accurate, but that comes as no surprise. The adaptation is liberal, and creates a very different story than the historical account. By removing a lot of the grimness of the revolution, the filmmakers could create a sparkling and grandiose mood to place their story into.
The songs and score are of a caliber Disney has not matched to date, although I confess that the Alan Menken / Howard Ashman team of The Little Mermaid and Beauty & the Beast comes very close. The music was written in the tradition of the Broadway musical, as Menken and Ashman did, and sounds exceptional.
I was especially impressed with the animation. There are no scenes where a particular character is draw badly, so scenes where the characters do not maintain their proportion to other characters, and no continuity errors. The drawing style is very similar to the older Disney - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and that crowd.
The characters are believable and entertaining; there are no ""awkward moments"" where a line seems badly written or placed, the songs are integrated perfectly into the dialogue, the layout work is exquisite, and the use of 3D technology is stunning and smoothly integrated. And Fox picked all the right people for the roles.
Overall, this is an incredible film, even more astonishing considering it was Fox's first attempt at an animated film. And it's not just a children's film, as animation is too often considered; it is a family film: anyone can see and enjoy it. Smashing!",1051920000,2,1703,4.937282229965157

948456,4,6304872402,"When the Russian king, Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown by the Bolshevik's revolution his entire family was taken hostage before being executed and buried in unmarked graves.  However, when those graves were at last discovered it seems that the youngest of his children, the princess Anastasia, was not among the bodies.  Even before this discovery it was rumored that Anja had escaped her fate with a sympathetic soldier from the Royal Guard.  Whatever the truth, to this day, no one really knows what became of the little princess.
Don Bluth's ""Anastasia"" attempts to offer up a fanciful account of the 'what if' scenerio that, while void of facts, is an engaging piece of musical fiction that really brings down the house.  So, in this case, Anja (voiced by Meg Ryan) is a precocious, independant woman growing up in impoverished Russia. She is suffering from amnesia when a con artist (voiced by John Cusack) reasons that she would be a great imposter for his scheme to steal a reward offered by the real Anastasia's grandmother who is exhiled in Paris.  One problem - the ghost of Rasputin (a figure of mythical interest in his own time)is out to destroy the last of the royals before she gets to Paris.
As is the case with animated movies, the blood and guts of the story are toned down.  Musical numbers are added in and everything is treated to an ultra high gloss glamor treatment that, while not historically accurate, is one hell of a show besides.  THIS IS BAR NONE THE BEST NON-DISNEY ANIMATED FEATURE FILM!  Bluth and his associates have created a rich tapestry of characters married to lush background drawings and a masterful score that really sets the film on a grand scale apart from anything North American cartoon buffs have seen since Walt Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY, nearly 50 years before.
Fox has given us the film in both widescreen and full frame formats.  Unfortunately the widescreen version is not anamorphic - a genuine disappointment.  That said, there's really nothing else to complain about.  Colors are eye-popping.  Fine detail is extremely well defined.  The sonic experience has to be heard to be believed.  We also get a documentary on the making of the movie which is informative and fun and the original theatrical trailer and Richard Marx music video ""Life Is A Journey"".  This is a great family film that I wish more adults would see.  It combines all the virtues and esthetics of the Hollywood/Broadway musical and animated feature film.

948460,4,6304872402,"""Anastasia"" is a animated musical that works despite some serious problems fundamental to the story for anybody who knows anything about Russian history.  The legend of Anastasia has in roots in a historical truth: that when the Communists executed the Romanovs and gunned them down, the young Grand Duchess was not shot; she fainted.  When it was discovered she was still alive she was clubbed and bayoneted to death.  But the ""truth"" remains, she was not shot dead with the rest of her family.  In this version that issued is rendered moot because the young Anastasia never joins her parents as they fled St. Petersburg.  However, the greatest historical liberty is the idea that the Russian Revolution was the result of a curse the mad monk Gregorei Rasputin laid on the Romanovs.  Forget Lenin and the Communists overthrowing the Czar; it was a crazy monk and his friend, an albino bat named Bartok.
However, ""Anastasia"" has several things working in its favor to counter-attack this nonsense.  First, there is the haunting ""Once Upon a December,"" which carries the mood of the story perfectly and comes into play at several key moments in the film.  The rest of the music is above average and avoids cuteness for the most part (the bad guys get the fun song with ""In the Dark of the Night""), but ""Once Upon a December"" is musically the cornerstone of the whole film.  Second, there is the wonderful vocal work by Kelsey Grammer and Angela Landsbury as the supporting characters Vladimir and the Dowager Empress Marie; they are the pair who provide the film with its heart while Anna and Dmitri wait for their brains to catch up with their hearts.  Third, in true giant cartoon movie style, the film reduces everything to the fundamental desire to go home and be part of a family.
Ultimately, the backbone of the story is more the 1956 Ingrid Bergman film version of the ""Anastasia"" story than history: a con artist wants to earn the reward for finding the lost heiress to the Russian thrown and turns an amnesia victim into Anastasia only to discover that she is the real thing and that he is in love with her.  Then basically they throw in the standard evil person trying to keep the princess and her boyfriend apart (think Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"" except instead of an evil queen it is a mad monk and instead of a giant dragon there is a small albino bat and the princess is really a Grand Duchess and the prince is now a former servant boy, but other than that they are remarkably the same).  Besides, kids like this film and they should be allowed to do so for a few years before they discover they can not learn history from movies (and should never let watching a movie substitute for reading an assigned book).",1042675200,26,2724,4.652083333333334

Secondly, though Rasputin was a pretty shady guy, he was generally liked by the Romonof family because he helped relieve their son's, Alexis's, haemophilia.

948524,3,6304872402,"This is the only animated movie I`ve seen that wasn`t made by Disney but managed to achieve the entertainment and charm of ""Disney magic"". When I saw this the first time I was eleven and I didn`t know the difference. I think the reason Disney stopped making so many animated features like the classics everybody knows is because they`ve run out of fairy tales and books to cover. The creators of ""Anastasia"" took an unthinkable story that you`d never think would make a passable kids` movie and pulled it off.
In some moments the movie is very much like the Disney masterpieces, but a great deal of it is pretty original. The main character, Anastasia or ""Anya"", is not much like any Disney beauty previously created, and there has never been a main Disney dude that acted or even looked at all like Dimitri. The movie has a different kind of feel altogether from the Disneys. When the characters go into song it suddenly has the setting and mood of an old-fashioned musical. There are parts in the beginning that remind me of ""Newsies"", and during the song ""You Can Learn To Do It"" the whole thing is kind of reminiscent of ""My Fair Lady.""
There are, of course, some hurting elements that Disney probably wouldn`t have allowed to happen. The computer animation goes from being beautifully done to overdone from scene to scene. In the beginning of the movie there`s blurs of white blowing around the screen that`s supposed to look like snow. There`s a part when a stone horse is attacking Dimitri and it`s the fakest, most poorly animated thing accomplished in a long while. Plus there are a few weak moments in the script, though overall the lines are full of good laughs.
To say something about the music, I liked that the songs reminded me more of classic live-action musicals than Disney movies. The score is very good, but I wouldn`t say better than even most scores from other animated movies. That`s a hard area to beat.
Overall, if you`ve never seen the movie you should see it at least just once to check it out. And if you`ve got kids, buy the thing. I had a lot of trouble borrowing the VHS from my friend`s little sister because she didn`t want to part with it.",1031356800,,2173,4.574358974358974

  Sure, the movie might not be historically accurate, but if it were, it would take away alot of the beauty element of the movie. and sure, it may have drawbacks, but that's to be expected....everyone has different taste in movies and films, and so everyone will view the film in a different way.
  In my own personal opinion, i found the movie to be one of the greatest achievements of animation technology. Based around young Anya, it is a movie about self-discovery, personal beliefs and the desire to reach a goal, no matter how impossible.

948633,3,6304872402,"Don Bluth is an incredibly gifted artist.  His character designs and animation can be breathtaking.  Unfortunately, he and frequent collaborator Gary Goldman can't tell a cohesive story to save their lives.  Of all of his films I've seen, ""Anastasia"" is by far their best.  Whether this is because of solid source material (although that didn't stop ""The Secret of NIMH"" from falling to pieces story-wise) or the incredible score by Lynn Aherns and Stephen Flaherty, ""Anastasia"" remains in my estimation Bluth and Goldman's most watchable movie.
Based loosely on a play by Marcelle Maurette and Guy Bolton. As well as the 1956 film adaptation of the play by Arthur Laurents, the story turns the mystery of the disappearance of Anastasia, daughter of Czar Nicholas, following the murder of the Russian royal family, into a fairy tale.  You have to ignore everything you know about history in order to accept the execution of the film--it plays loose with the Communist revolution and with Rasputin.
Dimitri (voiced with great charm by John Cusack, sung by John Dokuchitz) is a con artist living in St. Petersburg.  Along with his friend Vladimir (the entertaining Kelsey Grammer), he is searching for a young girl who can play the role of the missing Romanoff heir in order to claim a reward from the dowager empress who has escaped to Paris.  He meets Anya (voiced with much character by Meg Ryan, sung by the incredible Liz Callaway) and immediately sees in her the girl to carry out his plans.  As he and Vladimir work with Anya to perfect her ruse, he comes to realize that she is the true Anastasia.
Then we add the elements that make it a Don Bluth movie--Anya has a cute dog and there is a magical villain in the (dead) body of Rasputin (played gleefully over the top by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings).  And, of course, Rasputin has his cute animal sidekick in the form of an albino bat, Bartok (the always effective Hank Azaria).  Rasputin wants revenge on the Romanoffs for his undead state and sets off to kill the princess.  It should also be noted that Bernadette Peters and Angele Lansbury round out the voice cast in entertaining performances.
Okay, if you can put aside your feelings of misgivings regarding the animal sidekicks and revisionist history, there is much that is entertaining in this film.  The score by Broadway veterans Aherns and Flaherty is probably one of the best ever composed for an animated movie.  The script does provide action, adventure, romance, and comedy.  It's probably the most human script directed by Bluth and Goldman.  There is some spectacular animation, the runaway train scene stands out as truly effective.
There are drawbacks.  It is trying too hard to out-Disney Disney, from the opening number to the very structure of the story.  The computer animation isn't always well integrated.  The music box never looks like it exists in the same reality as the animated characters and the afore-mentioned train sequence is obviously not cell animation.  But these drawback are relatively minor compared to the overblown climax of the movie.  Still, flaws aside, it does entertain.  I have watched it several times and have definitely gotten my money's worth of this DVD.
The DVD ovvers you the option of fullscreen and letterbox presentation, a short featurette about the making of the movie, and a pair of sing-along sequences.
All in all, I recommend this movie to people who enjoy animated musicals.  If you like this, you may also like Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", Frank Oz's musical version of ""Little Shop of Horrors"", ""The Iron Giant"", ""James and the Giant Peach"", and ""The Nightmare before Christmas"".

948635,5,6304872402,"""Anastasia"" is my 2nd favorite Disney Animation movie (My most favorite one is ""The Quest for Camelot"")!! It's got fun and lovely songs, very nice animation characters, and lots of excitement! This movie is great to watch with your family.
This movie tells of the lost Russian princess Anastasia and her goal to find her true identity and how her family was killed by the curse of the evil sorceror, Rasputin (The revolution was the curse). When the revolution started in Russia, Anastasia, the royal family's youngest daugther, escapes barely with her life, but loses her memory when she tried to get on the train to Paris with her royal Grandmother. Anastasia falls from the train and hits her head but lives.
Demetre, who was the kitchen boy when the fateful day had happened,and his assistant, Vladimer hears that the Empress(which is the Grandmother) offers a huge amount of money for the one who finds her lost Russian princess, Anastasia. Demetree and Vladimer tries to find someone who looks like Anastasia to fool the Empress and get away with the money. They meet Anastasia, who calls herself Ania, and she is trying to find a way to get to Paris. The reason she wants to go to Paris is because her Grandmother had given her a music box with a key to make the music play. Ania (or Anastasia) has the key but does not remember how she had gotten it there or what it was for. On the key was an inscription: Together in Paris. Demetre and Vladimer is very suprised at Ania's likeness with Anastasia and 'tricks' her into pretending like Anastasia. They go off to Paris together but little do they know that Rasputin was still alive (but was falling apart into pieces because he had sold his soul to destroy the royal Russian family!) and had sent his evil minions to kill Anastasia. For if Anastasia was killed, Rasputin would no longer be 'falling apart'.
Can Anastasia and her 'friends' escape from the ghostly demons? Would Anastasia be able to recover her true identily?
I love this movie and it's wonderful to watch again and again! In my opinion, I think this movie had the best animation. I especially liked Rasputin's assistant, Bartok the Bat. Bartok wasn't really bad. I also liked Demetre, even though he WAS rather greedy at first, he became one of the heros in this movie. I very much recommend you to watch it!",1008633600,11,2331,4.660194174757281
948636,5,6304872402,"With witty dialogue and wonderful voice acting by Meg Ryan, Angela Lansbury, and John Cusack, this movie shines. Great songs also help too. Bartok is also funny. Did you see when tried to warn Rapustin of high blood pressure? That's a true classic. No matter what your age(I'm 14), Anastasia is bound to be a great piece of entertainment that will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.",996624000,2,384,4.661764705882353

The music is SO good and the story is cute. :) AND MOST OF ALL, dimitri is sooo cute. i love him. he's really the cutest cartoon character ever created. But the best part about the movie is that you can watch it over and over and NEVER get bored!! whenever i'm stressed out or upset about something, i can always watch a little anastasia and feel better!! my friends think i'm pyscho for watching a cartoon 50000 times because im 18, but i really feel that cartoons can be for anyone (like harry potter!) ok, i'm going to stop. But honestly, this is SUCH a good movie. I really highly recommend it to anyone. It's even better than Beauty and the Beast (if you can BELIEVE IT!)",984528000,2,722,4.3161764705882355
948716,5,6304872402,"...well, then this film is decidedly not what you're shopping for.  If, on other hand, you have a desire for something to placate children that is intelligent enough to sustain your interest (something, perhaps, other than another 'Barney' video), this may indeed be something you'd enjoy.

I admit, quite frankly, to having seen this film in the theatre when it was in cinema release (and to having enjoyed it); the story is fast-paced enough to hold the interest of younger children, while the plot and characterisations are sufficiently developed to satisfy most viewers (myself and my unsophisticated cinematic taste inclusive).

Perhaps the only question I might raise about this is its suitableness to the three-and-under demographic: Rasputin, the villian of the piece (and historically recounted as being the ""Mad Siberian Monk"" responsible for the bringing down of the Tsarist state...not that this accounting glosses the reality or anything, but...), has been nominally dead...when found by his (remarkably charming) sidekick, Bartok (an albino bat), Rasputin is literally falling to pieces...he may cut an image that is overpowering for the extremely young.

Miserable uncertificated attempts at psychoanalysis aside, this is really a delightful film...for me, the first animated film since Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" that I fell in love with.  Animated or not, this is a nice film...and as regards the animation, it is simply exquisitely done.",980726400,2,1460,5.442477876106195
948717,5,6304872402,"Anastasia is one of the best animated movies that has ever been created. It surpasses Disney's constant futile attempts at animation which are always too cute for their own good. The best character in the movie is Rasputin(voiced by Christopher Lloyd and sung by Jim Cummings). His comical way of falling apart adds a likeable element to his personality and with his eerie ,but catchy tune "" In The Dark Of The Night"". Christopher Lloyd really does an excellent job at bringing the spirit of Rasputin to life, and also, the comedic sidekick villain Bartok the albino bat brings a balanced out amount of evil in the villain to this movie.",974246400,,637,4.747747747747748
948718,5,6304872402,"Now I know just as many others here have said that the Anastasia of real life never had the story that we have here, at least so we think.
That's the fun of an unsolved mystery, you can make up the what if's.
And so  that is what we have here, A what if scenario given life by Twentieth  century Fox and Don Bluth. And what a wonderful little story they tell. It  is of a young woman who looks very much like Anastasia, but cannot remember  her childhood. Will her seach for discovery lead her to finding that she is  indeed the Princess Anastasia? Or will her hopes of finding a family be  dashed in Paris? So we have as this story unfolds one of the first, if not  the first, animated Movie that is aimed squarely at not only children but  their parents as well. The addition of Bartok and Rasputin are definite  adds for Children, but the rest of the Movie plays like a very nice  romantic comedy.
The animation is top notch, in fact after seeing this  movie again, after recently having seen _Tarzan_ made me realize how good  the animation really is. Personal tastes may vary, but I find the animation  much better than most of Disney's work.
The voice acting is very good.  Meg Ryan plays the role of Anastasia, and John Cusak plays the role of  Dimitri.
The music is very good as well, and while they are not as  memorable as _The Little Mermaid_ or _Beauty and the Beast_, they are still  very good.
As far as the DVD is concerned, I think Disney could learn a  lot from Fox Video. We have a Making of documentary, a little featurette,  the standard trailer stuff, and then two Sing-a-long songs that will  definitely appear to the younger audience.
If you are looking upon  building a DVD library, especially if you have Kids or like animation, then  this is a cannot miss purchase.",959472000,,1791,4.379939209726444

Also, to the voice actor's who did a wonderful job.  And last,  to the people who wrote and somewhat involve with the music soundtrack.  Absolutely beautiful.
The video and the sound was really good.  In terms  of child viewability, there are times when the dead Rasputin has limbs  coming off and as a parent, it is your choice if you want them to watch it  or not.  Nevertheless the movie is just plain awesome!
The extras...There  are quite a few of them but they are long.  From the games, puzzles and  trailers to the featurette and a special documentary hosted by Alliyah,  this is one DVD that I have to highly recommend.
For a non-Disney  animated film, this movie is definitely one of the best out there.  Highly  recommended!",959385600,,896,4.5
948720,4,6304872402,"I bought this movie because I've been interested in the mystery of the Grand Duchess Anastasia since I was a kid, not because I have rugrats. This movie was entertaining. Anya is a spunky heroine; Dimitri is a scrappy  hero; they have a sweet and surprisingly adult romance and the plot is more  realistic (except for the ridiculous villain Rasputin) than expected. There  is a lovely, melancholy song called ""Once Upon a December"" that  the amnesiac Anya sings in the empty palace as ghosts come out of paintings  to dance with her. This movie isn't historically accurate, but it's a  satisfying fairy tale -- the way we wish it had been.",957052800,39,639,4.711711711711712
948721,5,6304872402,"Don Bluth is my hero, seeing American Tail in 1986 when I was barely four and and seeing a beautifully animated character who I could relate to (Feivel). Now I look back over the years, and realize that he can do  anything. When he makes a movie, its never an ""Attempt"", but  always a masterpiece. I realize it was hard to depart from his beloved  cels, because he is an old-fashioned animator, who is essentially a kid at  heart. He has to be.
In Anastasia, Bluth brings to life the story of the  legendary Romanov Princess. I found the tale to be funny, but most of all,  gripping. My favorite part was when the ghosts danced out of their  paintings and danced with Anya in ""Once Upon a December"". I found  myself, watching alone whispering ""My God..."" because it was the  most incredible thing I have ever seen him do...well...one of them at  least... ; ) Bottom line, if it says ""Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, John  Pomeroy"" on it...no matter what it is...Whether it be Pebble and the  Penguin or Titan AE...American Tail or Anastasia...you are in for a treat.",956448000,,1059,4.515789473684211
948722,4,6304872402,"This is without question a very good movie, even if it's historically inaccurate (going by what other people say, here). Personally, if kids are interested in the history of the czars and Anastasia, this movie will spur  them to look further into the subject. I do agree with the person who said  that Rasputin's presence in the story was kind of unneccessary, and seemed  like a 'forced' bad guy, like they just needed a villan thrown into the  storyline (the whole falling apart thing was cool, though). He and Bartok  have a strong resemblance to Jafar and Iago in ""Aladdin"".But I  digress.
Being an artist and musician, I like to watch animated stuff for  those reasons best. The animation in ""Anastasia"" was very good,  especially the people and the background designs. I didn't care for the  scenes that overpowered drawn animation with computer animation, though.  (check out the stone horse @ the end.ea. chara looked good separate,but not  togeather)The different types of animation didn't flow as smoothly as some  other computer/traditionally animated films. And the music - to die for!  I  especially like the ""Once Upon A December"". The soundtrack is one  of the best things about the movie. Anastasia is definitly worth seeing.",955497600,,1241,5.014705882352941

But, there were too many  digital scenes. When a door shuts, it's all digital and then the cut to a  scene that looks all drawn.  The movie was good, but it seems it was  put together too quickly.

948816,5,6304872402,"Artistically this is one of the finest animated feature films produced by Don Bluth.  Though  best known for his work in the ""American Tail"" movies, he is also responsible for ""The Secret of  NIMH.""  This latest production shows what can be done when traditional  hand-drawn animation is combined with computer technology.  The result is  superb.  Outstanding animation matched with quality music and a reasonable  plot merge to form an entertaining movie for children and adults alike.  Sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy!
For the animation lovers out  there, watch for the details in the natural movements of the various  characters.
As for all the comparisons with Disney animation, I only ask  why?  The quality of Disney films varies greatly from film to film.  Bluth  has been far more consistent. Finally, the criticisms that this film isn't  historically accurate are moot.  Animated films rarely concern themselves  with accuracy.  Disney is one of the worst offenders.  Disney's insistance  on a happy ending comletely changed the story of ""The Little  Mermaid"" and ""Pocahontas"" but they're still entertaining  movies.",952819200,22,1132,5.301136363636363

Though some may quibble at liberties taken with actual history (after all,  Rasputin as an historical character differs most markedly with the film's  character ""Rasputin""), the movie DOES grippingly and  unflinchingly cover the assassinations of the Romanovs; things are not  ""prettied up"" beyond recognition. The spin taken on the Anastasia  legend is most interesting, and credible.

I would, however, like to add a note in defense  of the film's ""villians"", Rasputian and Bartok. Christopher Lloyd  was Rasputian, and he made Rasputian undoubtedly the best character villian  in the history of animated films. He got so _into_ his role, obviously  having a blast with his performance while at the same time doing a  wonderful acting job. Rasputian's voice will send chills down your spine!  I had no trouble believing that Rasputian was a ""real"" person  (yes, I _know_ he was a real person, but I am talking about his cartoon  version), insane and totally determined to get revenge.  A few have said  that Bartok, the white albino bat that is Rasputian's sidekick, is an  unnecessary character, but I disagree. KUDOS to Hank Azaria as Bartok;  there was some much-needed comic relief in all of Bartok's lines. His  timing was excellent, and he got the best lines of the film. A character  was needed for Rasputian's lines and personality to bounce off of: Bartok  is the ideal character, or bat, for the job!  His sense of humor made the  scenes all the more enjoyable, and were something of a grounding point. I  can't explain it any better than that!  To Hank Azaria; great job! This was  a great movie, for kids and adults alike. Enjoy! . . . and see the film  ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" while you're at it!  :)",946684800,,1495,4.625954198473282

I also love how creepy and repulsive the  villian is, especially when his body parts slowly comes apart to spook his  poor little ablino bat familiar. And whether this movie matches the actual  story about the fate of a Russian royal family or not, this is a pure  fantasy containing fantasy elements like ghosts dancing about in a deserted  courtroom. And on the other hand, there are quite a few things that I don't  really like about this animated wonder: plucky young Anastasia eventually  turns out to be a teensy-teenie little princess with a teensy-teenie waist,  just like any other Disney heroine.
