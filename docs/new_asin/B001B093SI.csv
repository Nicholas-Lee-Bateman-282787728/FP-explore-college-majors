8280737,5,B001B093SI,"A really fun filled flick from the folks of the D'Zone. John Johnson's ode to Ghostbusters hits you on all of the right levels and right places. John wrote, directed, and was one of the ensemble cast of this film. A great film to watch since you can see how much fun Darkstone had in making it.",1227484800,,294,4.175438596491228
