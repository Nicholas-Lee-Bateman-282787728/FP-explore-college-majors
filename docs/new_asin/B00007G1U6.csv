1809410,5,B00007G1U6,"A sequel to one of the greatest animes, Crest of the Stars, which happens to be my favorite series. It has great animation, a deep and rich story filled with amazing characters. This isn't your typical space action anime. The style in which the universe of Crest of the Stars was written can be compared to that of Tolkein himself. Hiroyuki Morioika, the author of the original sci-fi novels on which this series is based, went as far as to create a system of measurement, numbers, alphabet, and even a language for the Abh. This is a true masterpiece.
If you don't have Crest of the Stars, then get the 4 vol. collection, then buy Banner of the Stars. It can only get better.",1042070400,6,676,4.459677419354839

7976237,4,B00007G1U6,"Jinto and Lafiel are still the pivotal characters in this sequel to Crest of the Stars.  I have to disagree with those saying that characterization is lacking, it is in fact very well done.  A few things may be assumed from the Crest series for the leads, but besides that's it's still one of the series strengths.
This time the series focuses more on the Space War with the United Humans, than in the original.  I gave it a slightly lower rating because of that.  It was a little more difficult to contrast the two leads as shipmates.  I preferred the changing locations, and the dynamics of the original series.
Battle strategy, and space warfare were done very well, plus once again had a very realistic feel to it.  As in the first series, the animation, and visuals are all done first rate.  The series tries hard to create its own culture.  As the world of Star Trek, and the world of Star Wars, are structured to have an independent notion of the future.  So does the world of the Abhs and Humans.
One question I do have for series of this kind is why the political structure for such an intelligent race. They use what seems to amount to a Monarchy.  Basically, this is just a unified Feudal system, an ages old government with many flaws.  One of those flaws being that the Royals are those who ultimately command.  As history has shown us, there are wide differences between the intelligence, and ruling capabilities of Kings and Emperors!",1080345600,,1449,4.552123552123552
7976238,5,B00007G1U6,"Banner of the stars is overall an excellent series that blends the genre of science fiction with fantasy,  It has elves in outer space!  It is a grand space opera on the level of star wars, star trek, Space battleship Yamato (starblazers) with a bit of tolkien thrown in.  I wish the studio would release a box set for Banner of the stars and banner of the stars II.  I bought the crest of the stars set to economize, and loved the conflict and love story of the show.  It reminded me why I love Mythology, science fiction and fantasy literature.  Like the Lensman Books Of ""Doc"" smith and Empire and foundation novels of asimov. It also reminded me of my love for the works of edgar rice burroughs, mainly a princess of mars, and tolkiens middle earth saga comprised of the silmarillion, the hobbit and the lord of the rings.",1078012800,2,826,4.437086092715232
7976239,5,B00007G1U6,"In the Amazon.com Editorial Review, the reviewer claims that the producers of this series (as well as Crest of the Stars) spends too much time inventing words and runes and not enough time with character development and space battles. What if it does? Didn't Tolkien do the same thing with The Lord of the Rings? (Not the movies.) But they didn't: Crest and Banner are strong on character development, with Jinto's (and sometimes Lafiel's) internal monologues scattered throughout the series--which were kept from the original books, I assume. Also remember that this series is not about humanity, really. It's about the Abhs, which are human, but very different than your average human. There aren't going to be all that many traditional anime relationship/character building moments, because they sometimes don't work on the Abhs. In exchange you get some fresh ideas that you (and the planet-born humans in the show) maybe surprised at.
The space battles are gorgeous and there aren't very many of them, but if you're looking only for space battles you shouldn't be watching this series. This series deals much more within the bridges of ships and the characters and the planning of the overall war--sort of like a happy War and Peace for space operas. The entire concept of Plane Space (their faster than light travel method) makes large battles easier to comprehend for the viewers, while keeping the complexity of space battles and the need for good strategy, de-emphasizing the pretty graphics and large explosions and putting the focus on what is really the most important stuff.",1074556800,3,1587,5.084291187739463
7976240,4,B00007G1U6,"For those who enjoyed Crest of the Stars, picking up Banner of the Stars should be pretty much a given.
It takes place three years after the events of Crest of the Stars.  Lafiel, having finished training, is now the commander of her own ship.  She has quickly snatched up Jinto as her supply officer, and we meet the rest of her senior officers as they are brought up to speed on their first mission.
They are being assigned under one Admiral Atosuryua as part of a fleet with orders to create an Abh corridor through a solid United Mankind territory.  The entire fleet is abuzz with the news that ultimate responsibility for the mission will lie with Admiral Nereis Bebaus and his twin and Chief of Staff Nefee, who belong to a family nicknamed ""Spectacular Insanity"" for it's reputation of creating geniuses and madmen in equal measure.  Not exactly comfort inspiring.
Oh yes - and Atosuryua is the sister of Baron Febdash.  Yep - THAT Baron Febdash - the one who Lafiel had to kill back in the middle of Crest.  Disturbingly, she wants Lafiel and Jinto, the only people available who knew her brother, to join her for a memorial dinner to remember him.
Will the Bebaus twins remain sane through the whole mission?  Is Atosuryua painfully aware of what her brother was and grateful that Lafiel rescued her father from his imprisonment, or is she out for revenge?  Will Lafiel get her crew through the mission in one piece?  Tune in to the next two volumes to find out.
Banner successfully expands the Stars universe, mixing old characters and new.  The oh-so-bored Spoor, who rescued Lafiel and Jinto at the end of Crest, and her hapless Chief of Staff are back.  The intriguing Dusanyu, who made a cameo in Stars as the Abh representative to whom Jinto's father officially surrendered, plays a major role.  And it's hard not to laugh, though it may be nervous laughter, as the Bebaus brothers routinely question eachother to determine if they both retain their faculties.  It's genuinely funny, but you sympathize with their fear and shame and wonder if things are going to end well for them when all is said and done.  Finally, while their relationship is intact and dominant, it's nice to see Lafiel and Jinto's social circle expanding as they chat with the crew.
The Stars franchise remains space opera at it's finest.",1071360000,3,2325,4.708641975308642
7976241,5,B00007G1U6,I thought this dvd was great. It was just what I expected from a sci-fi drama series like this. To me they have much more action in this storyline. I love all the new characters. I think the battles are great. The voice actors couldn't have been picked better. I strongly recommend this series more than the first.,1046563200,2,314,4.431034482758621
7976242,5,B00007G1U6,"This is the second story arc out of 3 which have been animated from the novels.  Fulfilling the promise she made 3 years ago at the end of Crest of the Stars, Lafiel recruits Jinto to the bridge crew of her attack ship Basroil.  The crew are training for the war that soon begins and escalates through the rest of the series.  While the immense Starfleet Navy finally takes the offensive, Lafiel is sent to the front lines where attrition is high and the fate of her relatively small ship is never certain.
The story fits right in with Crest of the Stars, which felt incomplete at its end.  While the first series introduced the mystique of the Abh wonderfully in the first two shows, the story seemed to stray from that.  Be assured the Abh and their epic conflict return to center stage.  Given the normal run of 26 or 39 episodes for a show, this is only halfway through despite the title change, and fans of space opera who enjoyed Crest will be well pleased.",1044057600,6,963,4.4124293785310735
7976243,5,B00007G1U6,"Banner of the Stars is the sequel to one of the best anime series, Crest of the Stars.  This is a great dvd and leaves anyone who watches it wanting more.  It perfectly combines both a close friendship and political conflict in a vast universe to create a series that is near perfect.  It hints love between Jinto and Lafiel two of the star of this dvd.  It makes you feel that thier friendship and possible love between each other is accomplished a important because of their past conflicts and signifacant ethnic differences.  Before buying this dvd you must watch the first series, Crest of the Stars( which is also a must buy ), so that you will now whats going on.  This is a must buy for anyone who loves a good story, anime fan or not.",1043539200,3,742,4.340579710144928
7976244,5,B00007G1U6,"Banner of Stars is the sequel series to Crest of the Stars.  It is not required that you see Crest of the Stars to understand or enjoy this new release.  On the disc is an excellent synopsis of the events that took place in Crest of the Stars.  Banner of Stars takes place 3 yrs after Crest of the Stars.  In this disc you will see continued character development of the original characters (Lafiel and Jinto) as well as be introduced to new characters.  We watch as our beloved characters fight in the protracted war that began in Crest of Stars.  What seperates this anime from others of its ilk is its ability to show us the development of realistic relationships between its two leads and their supporting cast.  All the motivations behind characters seem very real and provide for excellent character development, which is what made the 1st series so good IMHO.  There is no ""sillyness or super deformaties"" in this series, which helps keep the atmosphere of the show realistic.  Buy this if you are a fan of Crest of the Stars or if you are looking for a sci-fi epic epic with realistic relationships and solid character development.",1043366400,3,1139,4.626865671641791
