7861468,5,6304096755,"This is a really enjoyable accound of the floods of '93.  There is LOTS of amazing flood footage, interviews of those that were victims as well as interviews of those that tried, and sometimes succeeded, to thwart the devastation.  My 6 year old granddaughter even enjoys watching this Nova episode.",1521676800,,299,4.96
7861469,5,6304096755,"I use this in my course on ""Our Hazardous Environment"" and have been doing so for nearly ten years. I cannot understand why PBS has not converted it to DVD themselves to market. There is not a better example of analysis of flooding in the midcontinent and the effects of ""flood control"" structures on large flood events.",1403654400,,320,4.631578947368421
7861470,4,6304096755,I teach disaster management at Delaware Technical & Community College and use this video in a course on the evolution of emergency management in the US.  There is no better way for students to grasp the enormity of historical disasters than through videos like this.,1375660800,,266,4.911111111111111
7861471,4,6304096755,"I have seen this video about four times, and every time I watch it, its impact is still the same.  This video provides an eye opening view of the 1993 Mississippi River flood.  From actual footage to interviews of those  most impacted by the flood's ravages, I was able to gather a new  appreciation for the struggles of flood victims.  This is also good as a  teaching tool, as I have shown this to 9-, 10- and 11-year old students as  we studied this unit.",963619200,3,458,4.317647058823529
