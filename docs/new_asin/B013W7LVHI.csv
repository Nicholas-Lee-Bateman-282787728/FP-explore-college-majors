7374318,1,B013W7LVHI,"This movie sucked. It was boring and the story wasn't great. It keeps going back and forth. Anyways, weak story, ok acting, bad plot.",1444435200,,133,4.583333333333333
7374319,2,B013W7LVHI,"Aloft focuses on Nana (Jennifer Connelly), a single mom who arrives with her two sons at a remote gathering in the middle of a wintry prairie in the frozen Arctic. Younger son Gully (Winta McGrath) suffers from an unspecified untreatable, fatal ailment. Older son Ivan (Zen McGrath), whos resentful of their trip, is an accomplished juvenile falconer. The family has come in search of some form of faith healing being administered by a mysterious individual known as The Architect (William Shimell). Nana discovers that she, too, possesses the power of healing, but tragedy strikes. The film then shifts 20 years later. Ivan (Cillian Murphy) has become a professional falconer. Though married, with a child, he appears to be one of the loneliest men in the frozen outback. Journalist Jannia Ressmore (Melanie Laurent) arrives to research a story about falconry, but she has an ulterior motive for contacting Ivan.

Peruvian director Claudia Llosa has fashioned a deadly serious, depressing motion picture about people deeply saddened by events in their lives. She switches back and forth between time periods, which can be unsettling, and the icy landscape adds considerably to the movies grim atmosphere. Ms. Connelly has not had great success with her recent movie roles and apparently took the part of Nana because it has greater depth than many of the characters she has portrayed. The movie illustrates the role belief in the supernatural and its healing power plays in the lives of some people. However, it distances the characters from the viewer so that they remain as cold and bleak as their surroundings. Pace tends to be slow, even though the movie is only a bit over an hour and a half.

Aloft was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2014, earning a nomination for the highest prize: the Golden Bear Award. It was also shown at the Sundance and Tribeca Film Festivals earlier this year. There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1443312000,5,1965,5.00611620795107
7374320,4,B013W7LVHI,"Some months ago, my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati started showing the trailer for this movie (which now is 1 1/2 yr. old), and I was really looking forward to seeing it. Then the trailer disappeared, and I thought this would never show up here. Then finally the movie showed up in early July. I figured this would not be playing long so I went to see it right away.

""Aloft"" (2014 release from Canada-Spain-France; 97 min.) opens with the character played by Jennifer Connelly (later we learn her name is Nana) and her two young boys, named Ivan and Gully, trying to catch a ride somewhere out in a remote 9and very cold) area in Canada. They go to a mysterious gathering of what looks to be a faith healer. Shortly thereafter we are informed ""20 Years Later"", where we get to know now grown-up Ivan, married and with a young baby. One day a Canadian journalist shows up out of the blue at Ivan's house. She informs him she is going up into the Arctic circle to go interview his mom and she wonders if Ivan wants to join her. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: firsts, this movie is written and directed by Peruvian director Claudia Llosa. She previously brought us the outstanding movie ""The Milk of Sorrow"", so that, along with the intriguing trailer, had given me high hopes for ""Aloft"". Alas, things are not that simple: ""Aloft"" is not a straight-forward movie, and it takes a LOT of time before I was able to piece together what the heck was going on. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it does require serious paying attention to the movie. The director jumps back and forth between the two story lines (separated by 20 years) throughout mots of the movie. The Big Reveal comes about 75 min. into the movie, and from then on I was very much into it. Second, Jennifer Connelly brings an outstanding performance as Nana, not always a likable character. Connelly is intense and emotive. Also nice work from Cillian Murphy as the grown-up Ivan, and last but not least also kudos to the 2 boys playing the young Ivan and Gully.

As a further aside, please note that what Amazon Instant Video is showing is the same shorter version as the one I saw in the theater in early July, and not the original version that has a running time of 112 min. (and which is what the theater had advertised this as the movie's running time). Imagine my surprise when the movie turned out to be at least 15 min. shorter. When I started looking into it afterwards, I read the plot summary as posted on Wikipedia, and there I learned of several key plot points that were missing entirely from the shorter cut that I saw. I've had some discussions on this issue on the IMDb boards, and it is pretty clear now that Aloft's original film festival circuit release in 2014 got a very mixed/lukewarm reception at best from the critics, so the studio decided to recut the movie before giving it a national release. I don't know whether the eventual DVD/Blu-ray release will contain the original longer version or the shorter theatrical version, or both. In all, ""Aloft"" contains enough interesting tidbits, but it's certainly not a movie without challenges. Still, if you are a fan of Jennifer Connelly, you'll want to give this a shot.",1439769600,16,3331,4.557595993322204
7374321,5,B013W7LVHI,"This movie left me speechless. Although the storyline is heartbreaking, this film contained some of the most amazing performances by all the actors and was beautifully realized through its breathtaking cinematography.",1468800000,3,217,6.032258064516129

7374326,4,B013W7LVHI,"There is one scene in this film which will stay with me a long time: when Ivan confronts his narcissistic New Age mother (Jennifer Connelly) 20 years after she abandoned him. Cillian Murphy is so extraordinarily raw,  vulnerable, and wounded in this scene, it was breathtaking. He had me in tears.  Charismatic, fascinating to watch,  always with a haunting, enigmatic quality--he never delivers the same performance twice, and is fast cementing his reputation as one of the world's greatest actors.

I liked this film a lot more than other people did and didn't find it difficult to follow at all. The problem is--it was just getting going when it ended abruptly.  I would have liked to see more interaction between mother and son, and some kind of reconciliation. A full 15 minutes was edited out of the US version--which is a lifetime in film--which might explain why people found it so choppy. (Apparently, in the original film, Ivan and Jesse have a brief tryst while on the road, which is why his feelings toward her warmed at the end.) I feel cheated that we didn't see the full version because it might be a lot better film than we know.",1455667200,10,1145,4.705
7374327,2,B013W7LVHI,"Confusing story line, NO SUBTITLES, handheld camera:  three strikes and you're out.  I am sure the concept is very art house and sophisticated but if you can't hear most of the dialogue because there are no subtitles and folks are mumbling a lot, and with no explanation whatsoever for all the confusing and mysterious events how can one appreciate this film?  About three quarters of the way through I began to get a glimmer of the plot:  healer abandons traumatized son to heal people and make strange architectural constructions.  My opinion?  NO healing work (and I am not a sceptic about some people's ability to heal) justifies leaving one's child behind.  I found Nana to be completely cold and without feeling with no instincts as a mother.  Either take your son along or postpone your 'work' until he is launched.  In short, I cannot recommend this film.  Yes, a brilliant portrayal by Jennifer Connelly but otherwise why bother?",1451433600,,938,4.879746835443038

7374330,4,B013W7LVHI,"I don't think this movie deserved the reception it got. Many of the audience and critics were at best bewildered by it, claiming it's story was far too hard to follow. I loved it, and was able to follow the storyline without a problem.  It is a story about love and forgiveness, but avoids of cliche of defining love for the audience. Instead it presents love as it really is, beautiful, yes, but often times it is hard to accomplish and incredibly painful.",1445040000,7,457,4.506024096385542
8729052,5,B013W7LVHI,"I like this one. It's slow paced and understated, gives time to think about what's going on and to feel what characters feel. The acting is very professional. I would not blame the mother for abandoning her son. That was probably the best she could do. As a healer, she healed somebodies little girl but paid with her younger son's life for that. So she probably decided to keep the older son away from herself for his own safety. But her son grew up in an angry man, he never could understand and forgive and it's easy to feel his pain and frustration. Or maybe he felt guilty for the death of his little brother and that was what he really was angry about. So the story is pretty realistic and I liked the ending. It's not about whats good and whats bad and not about miracles or New age, it's about feelings and relationships. It is not clear to me whether the mother was a real healer or not, but she believed she was and so did others.",1495324800,,940,4.256983240223463

8729054,3,B013W7LVHI,"The story line was amazing, I was enthralled by it, I was anticipating the next steps the characters would take; then it was gone. The ending of this movie was as if the writer just stopped mid sentence. Too many unanswered questions, too many what ifs. Some movies have an ending which leaves the viewer to decide on their own what happened next; this movie should not have done that. The acting was amazing by all. J.C. and C.M are brilliant in their work. Very dissapointed in the decision to end the story this way.",1494201600,,519,4.473684210526316
8729055,2,B013W7LVHI,"My husband and I watched about 20 minutes of this film. We both love Cillian Murphy and Jennifer Connelly. But this was too studiously perplexing. It was as if the director were saying ""We have all the Secret information & we are not giving it to you, the viewer.""
My husband & I like art films, unusual films (like ""Intermission"" another of Murphy's offbeat movies). But this one was too baffling to bother with.
It opens with a woman and children (one with a falcon) wandering around, looking for rides to somewhere.
A man appears in a crowd, hovering a ball over each person's hands. A child is taken into a tunnel made of willow branches. The falcon gets loose & breaks through the tunnel's ceiling. The child's father is so infuriated by this that he shoots the falcon (thanks to the director for Not showing the falcon falling from the sky or lying dead).
The Jennifer Connelly character has held the child in the tunnel (which features later).
Then everyone disperses. 20 years later, we're in some unknown territory (we still do Not know what time period this is, way in the future or when, a post-apocalypse or what---and I am SO sick of the theme of post-apocalypse).
Later the mysterious man (""The architect"" everyone calls him) tells Connelly the child has been partly healed.
Connelly's own child has a tumor, the doctor doesn't give much hope, surgeons won't agree to operate.
Cillian Murphy's character lives in a hovel with falcons, his wife/woman & a child.
A woman is driving along, talking on her cellphone in French (suddenly, when everyone else speaks English).
She is looking for Murphy's character. He is in hiding or hates people or something, too obscure to figure out.
We see a video with Murphy's mother (Connelly) peeking out from a forest. This enrages Murphy's character.
And we turned it off.",1484870400,,1823,4.772151898734177

8729058,4,B013W7LVHI,"The story is easy to follow. The mother may not be likable, but when it comes to the end you understand it all. Just because someone is a healer does not mean they are perfect or are good at raising children. Do not expect anything uplifting.",1472256000,3,242,4.282608695652174

8729060,2,B013W7LVHI,"After 10 minutes of the film, I decided I didn't want to watch anymore of it. Maybe it would of got better, but for me, I had enough.
  It may not be fair to write a review after only watching 10 minutes of it, but I figure some people are considering buying, renting or watching for free, therefore I should give my experience with it. Camera angles, close up shots for ultra brief times, and other editing has often been a pet peeve of mine with some films, especially films in recent decades. For those that are intrigued by the plot, it may very well be worth watching.",1469836800,,573,4.296296296296297
