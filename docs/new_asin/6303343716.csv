7844641,1,6303343716,"I thought I had already written a review of this POS because I was so pissed off for wasting my money on it. Maybe I wrote it for the dvd, either way, IT SUCKS. I remember Liquid TV, but I remembered the cool Liquid TV, not the rubbish they include on this ""best of"". Seriously, I think my brain had shut out these particular sketches because they were so horrible, like a victim of some traumatic event may forget their experience.

Enjoy the happy memories you had of watching Liquid TV when you were young, of watching MTV in general. Don't let this insulting  video spoil your cherished reminiscence.",1390521600,,604,4.532110091743119
7844642,3,6303343716,"This one just left me wishing Mtv would release all of the episodes on DVD. ""Best of"" is a matter of opinion and I do remember better. Way to much Aeon Flux crowding this short release. Worth the trip down memory lane but left me thirsty for more.",1283299200,,247,4.166666666666667
7844643,5,6303343716,"MTV release seasons of liquid television! AEON flux went on to be a movie imagine how much you could make if other less remembered series went on to be released as films.  But, you'd have to release them first........

please.....",1173398400,,230,4.725
7844644,3,6303343716,"MTV mystifies me.  They've given us hours and hours of reality TV shows, and then repackaged them on video.  Couldn't they have done the same for LTV?  This collection gives you a taste of what the show offered - half-hours of sometimes daring animation.  From the original ""Beavis & Butthead"" to ""Aeon Flux"", LTV delivered.  Though quality was uneven, the beauty of LTV was that you never knew what to expect - a quality of variety that's sorely missing here.  What about ""Art School Girls"" (one of the show's recurring bits)?  What about the nameless single sketches done?  Also, episodes of LTV had recurring themes that tended to filter through the otherwise disparate shorts (esp. in a season closer that ended on a somewhat languid and mournful Italian song ""Amore Baciami"".  Yet, while many inferior shows get released in their entirety, we only get a smattering meant to be representative of a very unique show.  Also, what does get on this tape is sort of questionable - ""Aeon Flux""?  Sure I enjoyed it, but Aeon got her own show (and apparently a movie is on the way).  Time was that you could enjoy groundbreaking, daring or simply unusual animation on late-nite TV before the onslaught of ""infomercials"" and then ""reality TV"".  Shows like LTV offered us a lot - they deserve more than a ""best of"".  It's time for a DVD season box-set.",1094342400,15,1346,4.721030042918455
7844645,4,6303343716,"lt tryed but didn't catch up with the fans...id recomend getting the actuall series like aeon flux the maxx wich are prity hard to find.  I think they ran out of print for aeon flux......
By the way has any one here ever heard of an old mtv 30 minute animated series for adults called Cartoon sushi?  It came out in the middle of 98...just wanderin when they might come out with a vhs or dvd......but give this video a try if you can find it..",1077062400,,443,4.1395348837209305
7844646,4,6303343716,"There's no denying that Liquid Television was one of the most innovative and entertaining shows to ever grace our television sets, thus making this compilation tape well worth tracking down. If I had one critisism, it would be that it's a little lacking in the Weird department, but nontheless still makes for fun viewing. Included are such classics as Aeon Flux, Crazy Daisy Ed, Stick Figure Theatre, Dr Zum and The Dangwoods. It's a damn shame that such wonderfully bizarre and creative viewing as LTV is no longer screened, but those of us who were lucky enough to have experienced the show will appreciate what is on display here.",998697600,11,634,4.825688073394495
7844647,3,6303343716,"Liquid Television was one of the very first animation shows that aired on MTV, and cetainly probably one of the best. It's were Aeon Flux, and Beavis & Butt-head first got it's start, and for the most part the first video mainly focuses on the Aeon Flux's claim to fame with 4 of her original episodes. Which is ok, but if you are buying this video for her, you might as well just get her full length video from MTV instead. Whatever happend to winter steel, or dogboy, or even beavis and butt-head's first skit? Well this maybe a good collection for those of us who forgot to tape it while MTV was airing it, but it certainly cant get all the best of's in one 45 minute tape....",996710400,4,679,4.271317829457364
7844648,4,6303343716,"I am going to list all the shorts on this tape, then express my thoughts.
Uncle Louie: Louie find a way to travel fast.
Aeon Flux: Aeon takes on an air assasination.
Crazy Daisy Ed: Ed runs into the cops.
Stick Figure Theater: Relive the King Henry era.
Dr. Zum: Zum explores the atom bomb factory.
Aeon Flux: Aeon runs into trouble on a night mission.
Stick Figure Theaters: The Night of the Living Dead and the Crash of the Hindenburg.
Dangwoods: Dwade get's caught up in bad dreams.
Aeon Flux: Aeon must save a harbor from sinking.
Crazy Daisy Ed: Ed rips on his friends landlord.
Big City: Music video of African-American life.
One Less Ant: A boy discovers how bad an ant can feel.
Aeon Flux: It's WAR! Aeon dies quickly, but it is lengthy.
Raisen: Watch as Hamilton pulls a Malade out of a hat.
The only shorts I feel that shouldn't be included is Dangwoods and Big City, because they are too long and not really entertaining. I love Aeon Flux, Crazy Daisy Ed and Stick Figure Theater as they are very original. Overall, worth the bucks, but I wish there was more on here.",995673600,28,1078,4.422110552763819
7844649,3,6303343716,"sigh. another tape from mtv, makers of The Maxx and Aeon Flux, comes another confusing concotion of crazy crap. not the worst tape around. and well worth the 11 some-odd dollars thier charging. if you enjoy the stuff mtv puts out.",985046400,,230,4.634146341463414
