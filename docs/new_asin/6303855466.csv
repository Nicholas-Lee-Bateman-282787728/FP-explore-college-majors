One of the couple is from a small village in Wales and was saddened that they might  loose this film.

736030,5,6303855466,"I first heard about this movie in the review section of the local paper when it first came out. It got the reviewers highest rating, which sent up the first red flag for me, because 95% of the time, if he rates it 5 stars,  and it isn't action-adventure, it is usually heinous by my measure. I  therefore did not see it in the theater. Big Mistake. While it does not  lose too much in the translation to small screen, (At least I don't think  it would), it kept me from knowing this wonderful movie for a year. I  finally saw it on video, and was instantly captivated. If you can  understand what is being said (no mean feat sometimes, the accents can  throw you for a loop), this understated little gem will instantly sweep you  off your feet. Especially engaging was Colm Meany (Of Star Trek:The Next  Generation and Star Trek:Deep Space Nine fame, as Morgan The Goat (The  village has a lot of people living there with the same first name, so the  villigers identify certain people by their occupation, or other things  describing them (your guess as to why they call Morgan ""the  goat"", he runs the motel in town)). He, and the preacher were the two  standouts in the movie. SEE IT is all I can say, and I can't say it with  enough passion.",915580800,10,1244,4.37117903930131

736434,5,6303855466,"""The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill..."" is an EXCELLENT movie, based on a true story. It was filmed on location in Northern Wales. A nearby village had to be substituted in the film, because Taff's Well - the real name for the fictional ""Ffynnon Garw"" in the movie - was too built up to resemble a rural Welsh village from 1917.

When I found this movie available on Amazon, I ordered two copies of the DVD, after seeing the ""The Englishman..."" as a TV broadcast in April 2015. I don't know why I had never come across this film before, or heard of it 20 years ago when it had first appeared. Though Roger Ebert really liked this movie, other 1995 reviews are rather tepid.  My own opinion is that this quirky, funny production is well done in all respects. The DVD quality is flawless, too.

I am happy to have my own copy now, to watch again and again (I got one copy for myself, and one to give as a gift.)",1436054400,2,908,4.206896551724138

THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN: For years, I endured praise for ""Local Hero,"" because I couldn't put my finger on what exactly I disliked about it. Now when someone mentions that overrated movie, I hand them a copy of this: the movie ""Local Hero"" *should* have been. Even though on the surface it appears to be a shaggy dog story of epic proportions, it is in fact a pixieish, picaresque true tall tale, setting quirky characters against some of the most enchanting landscapes on earth.

While the subplot, concerning the romance between the affable Anson (Grant, in his usual shy, stuttering, self-effacing screen persona) and Betty (Fitzgerald), the spunky maid with the delightful overbite, is sweet, the real emotion is generated by the town's almost religious mission to exalt, literally, their would-be mountain, pulling together in a fight against time, storms and limited resources. Their task is not without its redemptive rewards--but also not without its bittersweet sacrifices.

A joyous, uplifting, triumphal, endearingly wry smiler; and, yes, even precious (in the best sense of the word), right down to a delightful surprise at the end, lest we believe that this is indeed just another shaggy dog tale.",1421884800,,1504,4.913385826771654

736675,4,6303855466,"""Perhaps it would have been different had there been no war. But this was 1917 - and people were exhausted by loss.""

So the tale of a small Welsh village is told thru the voice of the last living participant to The Day Ffynnon Garw Built A Mountain.

A result of the newly invented airplane entering the battlefield, and by order of his Majesty, a nationwide geographical survey is undertaken. Two-man survey teams are sent out across the land to accurately map the significant features - mountains, hills and valleys.

One particular team has been tasked with western England.

Way off the beaten track, a rural village lay in the shadow of Mount Ffynnon Garw, the so-called First Mountain Of Wales. A quiet little hamlet whose townsfolk are made up of the ubiquitous mix of funny, sympathetic, and quirky peoples. Country folk for whom hard work is the Lord's work.

Understandably curious about the official Crown Survey, lively debate surrounds how big their mountain actually is; congregating at the town pub to discuss the matter, laughter and good cheer abound.

Supremely confidant ""the English"" will find nothing untoward and will quickly move on - the news they deliver comes as shock. The surveyors make the terrible pronouncement that their mountain, their singular claim to Welsh pride, the stone embodiment of their combined hearts and souls -  is technically a hill. Their calculations are accurate. At 884 feet, short by sixteen feet, their mountain - isn't. And once recorded into the national charts it will be forever known as Ffynnon Garw Hill.

One couldn't have done worse to the already decimated people had they dropped a bomb directly into the center of the village. Already emotionally and physically devastated from supporting the war effort and the omnipresent life-devouring coal mine - the people will brook no further wounds. Especially from two Englishmen.

Determined to reclaim their 1,000 foot ""mountain"" status, the residents embark on a massive collective effort to close the 20 foot gap - by building upon Ffynnon Garw's summit with freshly tilled earth, back-breaking sweat, and even tears. Johnny Shellshock, broken survivor of the French trenches, whose battlefield experiences have left him mute, speaks for the first time in over a year to enjoin his fellows to take on the challenge.

The quest becomes a race as the townsfolk have to devise various ploys to prevent the cartographers from leaving before they can bridge the shortfall. Suddenly, the team's automobile breaks down; the broken part cannot be secured for several days. The cheapskate pub proprietor suddenly supplies them with an unending stream of alcohol. And even a comely maiden is secured to entice the handsome Mr. Anson; the young veteran who begins to sense, unlike his drunken disinterested partner, the magnitude surrounding their seemingly simple task.

A wonderful light comedy with Hugh Grant at his dry best. Kudos to Colm Meaney who, despite a faltering accent, was enjoyable as the pub proprietor and town ""father"".

Movie Notes:

- As pointed out at the beginning of the film, given the few family surnames in their village, sharing a name is both commonplace and confusing. To address that situation, one is given a nickname usually associated with one's profession or significant personality trait. So John Evans might be Evans The Butcher or Evans The Clerk, and so on.

Also explaining how one resident was given the longest name in Ffnnon Garw history: The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain.

- I would be remiss and cursed if I did not highlight the *amazing* performance of late UK actor Kenneth Griffith. A potent delivery of character as Ffnnon Garw's guiding pastor, Reverend Jones. Genuinely hilarious as the overseer and protector of the town's collective soul, and the character who first foresees the horror that will befall the village should their mountain be downgraded.",1392508800,7,3935,5.069659442724459

The credits show that the movie was written and directed by Christopher Monger, form a story by Ifor David Monger, from a story by Ivor Monger. That is a lot of Mongers.

Anson (Hugh Grant), cartographer for the government, is tasked with measuring a hill that the locals insist is a mountain. The term mountain is arbitrarily given as 1000 feet or more. It looks like touch-and-go before a little divine intervention and a little help of the village folk make an adjustment. Mean time Anson has time to learn of the pleasures of village life and Elizabeth aka Betty from Cardiff (Tara Fitzgerald.)

This will be a short and simple review on the quality of the picture and sound and extras.  Well, REALLY short in terms of the extras because there are none.  As for picture quality, clearly this DVD was not made from an original master print of the film.  Most likely, it's just a copy of the original VHS video that was sold just after the 1995 theatrical release.  There is no evidence that anyone even remotely attempted to source a quality print of the film for this DVD.  When viewed on a modest 52"" Sony Bravia television, there was clearly visible pixellation that would not normally be present on a quality DVD sourced from a quality print.  The sound suffers the same low-resolution problems as the video.  The audio is probably just stereo format which makes no use of modern home theatre set-ups despite the claim that this DVD was released in 2011.  So, buyer beware.

Knowing that there is a kind of love-hate relationship between the Welsh and the English, made the plot of  this movie even more interesting to me. Two English fellows working as cartographers measuring hills and mountains in Wales during the period of WW-I figuratively step on the toes of the locals when they discuss with the Welsh that the nearby ""mountain"" that they hold so dear, may not be a mountain at all, but is only a hill (a mountain had to be at least 1,000 feet elevation above sea level to appear on His Majesty's maps -- and this one is just short of that elevation.. The younger surveyor (Hugh Grant falls for a local girl (Tara Fitzgerald).  There is much humor, Welsh-style throughout the movie. some subtle and some that provokes guffaws. The villagers decide that no one, especially an Englishman, is going to tell that their beloved mountain is only a hill and won't appear on the map. The whole village arises en masse and starts making the hill taller, using buckets and wheelbarrows full of good Welsh soil -- much of it taken from the village's previous carefully manicured soccer field.  Colm Meany plays the role of the village pub keeper who seems to have a way with the village lasses.

736848,4,6303855466,"This is a delightful, low-key witty film focussed on the foibles of the Welsh nation; it's also a tale of romance. Two archetypal early 20th century Englishmen, Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) and George Garrad (Ian McNiece), are sent as cartographers on behalf of the Ordnance Survey to measure the height of a mound in a Welsh mining village. The mound in question - Ffynnon Garw - is regarded with great pride by the locals as their characteristic mountain. For those not familiar with the typography of Wales, there are a lot of mountains here and each community is very proud of their local mountain (or occasionally, beach). So when the surveyors find the Ffynnon Garw is a few feet short of a mountain (just under 1000 feet), the locals set to and carry buckets of earth to the top so that it is over 1000 feet. This may sound like a ridiculous story, but the humour is all in the telling and those who tell it. Having succeeded in building up their hill, the community is dismayed when the local rain washes some of the earth away that they have transported so laboriously. For those not familiar with the climate of Wales, rain here closely resembles that of the Indian monsoon season. So the locals have to set to again and cart some more earth up the hill. In the process of communing with the locals, Anson falls in love with a local girl, Betty from Bardiff (Tara Fitzgerald), so it all ends happily -though sadly, it all proves too much for the local vicar, Reverend Jones (Kenneth Griffith), who is fittingly buried on his mountain.",1359417600,,1543,4.594202898550725

It you rate films by special effects, shoot em up, kill them all and abuse their women folk, then this is not for you.  This film gives you a good, warm feeling throughout. Not that it doesn't touch briefly on the ""seamy"" side as most of the babies in the church look just like Colm Meany's Morgan the Goat, though why Morgan hasn't gone to war is not mentioned. The only drawback is the Irish actors playing Welsh characters and occasionally slipping up in their accents.
If you don't speak Welsh you miss a very delightful comment by Williams the Petroleum.  When the Englishmen's car is sabotaged they push it to the local garage. Williams breaks a rod and says, ""I see what's wrong with your car but I don't know what you call this in English. In Welsh we call it ""bethyngalw"".  There is no more comment on this.

Rallied by their minister, the entire town sets about making sure it's tall enough.

This sweet and folksy comedy has a thin plot and moves at a snail's pace, but still succeeds thanks to the coziness of the village, the close bond the locals share, and Hugh Grant's boyish charms. Filmed just after ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" but before he was an international star, Grant is bright, likable, and interesting and not-yet affected by his trademark stammering and eyelash-fluttering.

It's about a Welsh town that wants their local hill to be recorded as a mountain on the official cartographers' maps. So, what do they do? Pile a bunch of dirt on it until it becomes high enough to be considered a mountain!

The story is heart-warming and light-hearted at the same time. There are humorous moments (such as various plots to delay the cartographers from leaving town), but the movie revolves around the industriousness and pride of the villagers. Exemplifying their attitude is Morgan the Goat, played beautifully by Colm Meaney. Originally an outcast, he rouses the townsfolk toward greatness. His speech defending the decision to enlarge the hill has a humorously stirring ring to it - reminiscent of Braveheart... but without the weapons. The fire-and-brimstone preacher also ends up becoming an absolutely lovable character.

Hugh Grant also gives a good performance as the assistant cartographer. I'd warn Hugh Grant though fans that he doesn't come across as suave and sexy as he does in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/dp/B0002W4SWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>. Rather, he's a bit insecure and occasionally bumbling. It's nice to see that Grant can play those roles as well.

My only complaint with the DVD is that the sound quality is horrible. Already, it's difficult for American-English speakers to understand the thick Welsh accents. However, the dialogue is very soft throughout the movie and I had to turn my speakers up much louder than I ever had before. Then, in those one or two scenes when the sound reached normal volumes, they nearly shattered my ears because I had turned the speakers up! I hope that's something that could be fixed for a blu-ray release.

It's about a Welsh town that wants their local hill to be recorded as a mountain on the official cartographers' maps. So, what do they do? Pile a bunch of dirt on it until it becomes high enough to be considered a mountain!

The story is heart-warming and light-hearted at the same time. There are humorous moments (such as various plots to delay the cartographers from leaving town), but the movie revolves around the industriousness and pride of the villagers. Exemplifying their attitude is Morgan the Goat, played beautifully by Colm Meaney. Originally an outcast, he rouses the townsfolk toward greatness. His speech defending the decision to enlarge the hill has a humorously stirring ring to it - reminiscent of Braveheart... but without the weapons. The fire-and-brimstone preacher also ends up becoming an absolutely lovable character.

Hugh Grant also gives a good performance as the assistant cartographer. I'd warn Hugh Grant though fans that he doesn't come across as suave and sexy as he does in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridget-Jones-s-Diary/dp/B0002W4SWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>. Rather, he's a bit insecure and occasionally bumbling. It's nice to see that Grant can play those roles as well.

My only complaint with the DVD is that the sound quality is horrible. Already, it's difficult for American-English speakers to understand the thick Welsh accents. However, the dialogue is very soft throughout the movie and I had to turn my speakers up much louder than I ever had before. Then, in those one or two scenes when the sound reached normal volumes, they nearly shattered my ears because I had turned the speakers up! I hope that's something that could be fixed for a blu-ray release.

Wrong.

""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"" is a gentle comedy about simple people in a small Welsh village during World War I who take great pride in the mountain in whose valley the town is located. But when two British surveyors come to measure the mountain as a part of the war effort, the townsfolk are dismayed to discover that -- at least by the British standards -- their mountain is only a hill. Of course, the Welsh will do anything to ensure that their mountain is deemed a mountain.

Underlying the humor of this film is the poignancy of a community that is trying to hold on to its identity in the face of a war that has devastated the population and has left the community something of a shadow of its former self. They have lost men in war -- some killed, some who come back shell-shocked -- and so they do what they can and what they must in order to hang on to their identity. The scene in which a shell-shocked young man journeys up the mountain during a thunderstorm is particularly moving.

Although the Brits can do broad, over-the-top comedy as well as anyone else (Monty Python comes to mind), they also have the knack of doing small, gentle comedies as well as, if not better, than anyone else. And the scenery of Wales is absolutely breathtaking.",1252022400,4,1498,4.416666666666667

736983,5,6303855466,"I have actually also read the book, which tells you something about the impact this movie had upon me.  In it Monger points out one of the great ironies of the story- the man with the longest and most enigmatic nickname did not need one:  The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain was quite probably the only man named Anson living West of the Welsh border.  He wasn't named Williams, Evans, Jones or Morgan. That he had one was a mark of the respect and admiration that the townfolk had for the schoolmaster.  And understandably: In the course of the movie we see a high class Englisman fall in love with a place and a people, not just Betty From Cardiff.

This is a story of a miracle that these humble Welsh folk wrought for themselves: A miracle of love, courage and healing in the midst of awful war [OK, there's a wee bit of skullduggery as well]. It takes place towards the end of the First World War- at a time when the lives of ordinary people had been brutalized through the sheer shock of massive loss- scarcely a single family had not seen a husband, son or father die- and if not your own family then you had lost a friend to the war.

Hugh Grant's character, Anson, is himself a victim of shell shock or what we would now call PST. He has been reduced to a pale shadow.  But he wants to live again, if only he can find the courage.  To me this is the real theme of this movie- that to love takes courage, but you cannot really live unless you love.  That truth underpins the emotional climax of this movie: It is exemplified most of all in the character of Anson in that moment after the sun has gone down on the last possible day when the town's dream of officially restoring the status of their mountain can still be attained: The moment when Betty asks him to stay the night atop the mountain so that he can measure it in the early morning light before he has to leave.  She takes an extraordinary risk, putting her reputation permanently on the line by offering to stay the night with him to keep him company.  Of course, what she is really offering him is far more than merely a single night. And then we watch a miracle unfold as Anson finds the courage to fight past the trauma of war and his class prejudices to accept her offer of a lifetime of love. It is a truly moving, indeed tearjerking moment because we can actually already see that this is a decision that he will never, ever regret, no not even for an instant- no matter what his highbrow family might (no, make that absolutely will) think of his bride. It is a truly beautiful moment and Tara Fitzgerald and Hugh Grant were never better than at that moment in this movie- acting so good that we see the future of their characters unfolding before them.

Supposedly based on a real story (but probably not) and set in 1917, it tells the story of two English cartographers (Hugh Grant and Ian McNeice) who arrive in a Welsh village in order to take the measure of the nearby mountain, considered the pride of the locals. According to the height (more specifically, if it is higher than 1,000 feet), it will be determined whether it is indeed a mountain or it is just a hill. When the first measure turns out that it is just a few feet under the 1,000 mark, the anxious villagers will take action. In order to makes sure that it is recorded as a mountain, they will transport dirt and soil from the fields, and to the peak, bucket by bucket. At the same time, they will do everything to prevent the two cartographers from leaving town before they can take a second measure. Eventually, Grant, who falls in love with a local girl (Tara Fitzgerald), will help the villagers in their task (the other cartographer is much more meaner and dismissive of the Welsh).

736988,3,6303855466,"In 1917 English cartographer Reginald Anson (Hugh Grant) comes to South Wales to measure the famous border mountain Ffynnon Carw for His Majesty's Royal Map. There is one criteria for a mountain to be labeled such: it must exceed a height of 1000 feet; if below that it is considered a hill. The mountain is the pride of all Welshman as it has protected them from all invaders throughout the centuries thereby preserving ""ancient Britain."" When the measurement comes in at 984 feet the Welshmen become totally unhinged. Their pride has been challenged, their very core has been shaken and they set out on a plan to add twenty additional feet to pass the Royal test!

Ivor Mongor had written a delightful short story by the same laboriously long title. The result has been Christopher Mongor stretching that simple story into a 100 minute screenplay that feels every bit stretched as the hill was in order to meet a criteria to film a movie! Love interests and subplots about the Great War have been added in order to fill out the time, but the result is a movie, that though very charming and clever, should have remained a ""hill"" instead of making it a ""mountain."" The conclusion of the story is inevitable, but getting there is as tedious as every bucket of dirt that the townspeople lug up Ffynnon Carw. Even Stephen Endelman's delightful musical themes lose their Celtic charm and effect as they are heard and reheard time and again as if he too was ""stretching!""

Visually, the film is quite appealing as we are allowed to focus time and again on the majestic countryside of Wales. The colours and textures used are extremely vivid and pleasing to the senses; but one grows impatient with all of the ""filler"" material that drags out what was originally a very precise and well crafted little gem of a story. Lop off twenty minutes, get rid of nonessential characters and tell the original story and perhaps this film would ultimately ""rise"" to the occasion!",1181088000,,1962,4.733918128654971

Hugh doesn't understand at first why the people are taking such an adamanet side on behalf of the hill, but gradually he is influenced by the small town comraderie and decides to help. That, and the fact that he has fallen hard for the lovely maid Tara Fitzgareld.

I felt at first it was going to be an enormous ""chick-flick"", the story is actually much deeper than just the love connection between Grant and the local girl.  It is actually a story of a town and the strength of their belief.  It also portrays a small town coping with the loss of so many young men and boys to the war.  While I thought it was going to be nothing but the usual Hugh Grant film, it was less about Grant and more about this little town in Wales.

Based on a true story, I watched with amazement as townspeople put aside their differences, put aside their hatred, put aside their lives, to create a mountain from a hill. This mountain represented more to these people then money, then jobs, then anything that we now take for granted. Could you honestly say that if your hometown asked you to build a mountain that you would join, or would you wonder first if you had the time?

I am impressed with this style of film. I have only seen a handful of films that have the theme of community as their central focus, one is going to be my movie homework, another is a great British film called Saving Grace where a community comes together to help a local widow.

I did have some issues with this film. One big one was the title. Please, if you are ever going to make a film do not make the title also the plot. I mean, I think you can gather from the title what the entire film is going to be like. Another problem was that this film was too simple. I felt that some deeper sub-plot could have been created to bring some depth to this community. I think the director tried to do this with the story of the local boy who had gone to war only to return mentally unstable. I think this could have been such a great sentimental story, but it just was not developed enough. This goes the same for the girl that Grant fell in love with. I felt that it was well too rushed. It only seemed that near the end of the film they truly loved each other and wanted to marry after only spending three to four days together.

Maybe times were simpler back then, and perhaps that is another smaller theme, but I think this was a much deeper film.  Deeper than I could have imagined. Bravo to ""Star Trek"" man Colm Meaney with his portrayal of Morgan the Goat. He stole this film away from Hugh. See this film if you have the chance.

The movie is billed as a comedy.  It is not.  There is absolutely nothing funny in the entire film.  Hugh Grant and his surveyor boss stumble on the scene of a Welsh town that is so deeply backward that they take grave offense at the idea of the local mountain being classified as a hill.  There is nothing funny about their primitive psychology; and indeed I felt increasingly uneasy as the animosity of the townspeople toward the English surveyors began to mount.  I could not help but feel that the population was just a hair's breadth from murder at all times.  Instead the good townspeople content themselves with permanently sabotaging the car of the surveyors.  The upright fire and brimstone local vicar has a hand in the sabotage, saying ""Forgive them God, for they know not what they do"" as he slashes a tire.  I find this utterly creepy.  The vicar might as well be murdering the surveyors, offering the same schismatic formula.  In the meantime, a local prostitute is brought in to ply Hugh Grant with her charms.  Romantic, isn't it?  Just as coyly funny as Johnny Shellshocked, the local war victim, becoming unglued on top of the mountain in a thunderstorm as he tries to assist in the chicanery of piling dirt on the mountaintop to augment its height.

To have their mountain reclassified as a hill threatens their regional pride and identity.  Naturally, they stubbornly set out to do something about it.  In a town with so few surnames that people are designated by profession or personality - Williams the Petroleum or Evans the End of the World - the town has its surprising divisions that first must be bridged.
The charm of this film lies in its gentle good humor and the coziness of the small Welsh community it evokes.  Everything about this film is simple - the premise, the characters, the conflict, the resolution - and this lack of complexity allows the determination of its characters to shine through in a way that a more boisterous film would not. Hugh Grant plays his usual awkwardly charming character, fitting for the role but occasionally annoying.  Colm Meaney is wonderful as innkeeper Morgan the Goat, and Kenneth Griffith turns in a remarkable performance as Morgan's foil, the elderly but feisty Rev.  Jones.  Tara Fitzgerald is radiant as the love interest Betty.  Ian Hart as Johnny Shellshocked nicely underplays his part as the young man returned from the war with emotional scars.
Indie film aficionados and Hugh Grant fans will probably like this movie more than the average American viewer will.  This quiet exploration of the huge emotional difference wrought by a few feet will delight those seeking a feel-good movie without commercial flashiness.  Stay away if you are looking for a hilarious romantic comedy because, chances are, you won't find it here.",1081900800,54,2125,4.941011235955056
737111,5,6303855466,"""All this fuss...over what?  Is it a hill, is it a mountain?  Perhaps it wouldn't matter anywhere else, but this is Wales.""
So what happens in this epic story about the Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain?  On Sunday, 17 June 1917, cartographers/retired army officers Reginald Anson and George Garrad come to a Welsh village to measure Ffynnon Garw to determine whether it's a hill or a mountain.  Their presence causes anxiety among the villagers, who are on pins and needles when they hear the British standard of a mountain defined as anything over 1,000 feet.  The Britons stay at the inn of the cheeky Morgan the Goat (as opposed to Morgan the Sheep?), intending to leave after their task is completed.  However, guess what height Ffynnon Garw is less than?
The villagers put things in motion with two objectives:  one, to make sure their beloved Ffynnon Garw becomes a mountain, and two, to extend the Britons' stay, such as something involving two pounds of sugar and a gas tank, and a knife.  The first objective forms the action of the movie, villagers moving dirt from their gardens bucket by bucket, tray by tray, through toil, sweat, and sacrifice, and placing them...guess where?  And excuses for delay?  The war--take note of the date listed above.
There's also a conflict between the religiously fervent Reverend Jones and Morgan, as the latter doesn't go to church and plies alcohol.  When Jones asks Morgan, ""Have you no shame?""  Morgan flippantly pats himself down and says ""No, can't think where I left it"" and walks off, leaving Jones fuming.
During the movie, we see that the younger Anson is more sympathetic and humble to the villagers, while the stout and older Garrod is more logical, arrogant, and looks down on the Welsh.  A typical British attitude during the period of Empire there.  Anson is also taken by Betty, a maid who comes to help Morgan tend bar and also to charm the cartographers.  It all goes back to Anglo-Welsh relations.  The Welsh have had a rough time of it all, like the Irish.  Those who survive the trenches of France return to labour only to die for coal.  Sad times indeed for the Welsh.
The whole point of the movie is not just the standard height set for a mountain, but Welsh pride, of national identity.  For the Welsh, all they have for monuments are mountains, no pyramids or temples.  And if Ffynonn Garw isn't a mountain, then Anson might as well redraw the map and put the Welsh in England.  After all, as Morgan tells Betty, ""Maps are the undergarments of a country, they give shape to continents.""  And what's in a measurement anyway?  As Morgan says, ""Do we call a short man a boy or a small cat a dog? No! This is a mountain, our mountain, and if it needs to be a thousand feet, then by God let's make it a thousand feet! E In other words, it's all relative.
The concept of telling the village people with identical surnames by their occupation or personality is ingenious and charming, so we can tell the difference between Williams the Petroleum from Williams the Deaf.  Some are more telling, as in the case of Johnny Shellshock.  And there are the Thomas Twps:  Thomas Twp and his brother Thomas Twp 2.  As one of them says, ""we've no learning than most, so people say we're twp, but we're not twp as to not know that we're twp.""  Right, that makes sense.
All the leads are splendid, particularly Colm Meaney as Morgan the Goat and Kenneth Griffith as the strict but passionate Reverend Jones.  And Hugh Grant (Anson) has another charming leading lady, Tara Fitzgerald (Betty), who ranks up there with Andie McDowell (Four Weddings) and Martine McCutcheon (Love Actually).  She really has a winning smile and saucy brogue that makes her character lovable.  And darn if Ian Hart keeps popping up, be it Harry Potter, Michael Collins, and now here, as Johnny Shellshock.
A wonderful little movie with a wonderful Celtic score, as the ideas and themes that emerge make this more than a one-joke movie.  And for you boyos, this was written by Hamlow_the_Writer_Who_Went_Up_A_Paragraph_But_Climbed_Down_A_Review.",1069718400,107,4094,4.746817538896747

Subtle humor, various characters including one traumatized by the war (WWI) and those that develop over time, and a nice collection of scenes to look at made it really worthwhile.  In our over-hyped, rushed scenes, odd camera angles, and star-worshipping, it's nice to have a quiet little film to just relax with.",1059696000,4,439,4.7631578947368425

This film has a lot of unspoken wit and charm...pleasant, simple storyline; interesting ""every day"" kinds of characters.  Thought the story line development was superb.

737115,2,6303855466,"I guess you have to be a huge fan of British humor. I mean, so huge, that you love a British movie just for being, well, a British comedy. I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant. I enjoyed Notting Hill and I LOVED Four Weddings and a Funeral.
But this movie was a lame duck. It's supposed to be funny that a little town gets all in an uproar over the fact that what they perceive to be their 'mountain' is a handful of feet short of being considered a mountain, by mountain height standards (MHS). So bent out of shape are they, that they keep the mountain measurers in the town, and while they're not looking, the townsfolk pile dirt and grass on top of the hill, because apparently a hill with a 16 foot mount on top of it makes a mountain.
It's a one joke movie where the joke just isn't funny. To please the viewers, they throw in a romance at the end of the movie that doesn't work. She starts off hitting on our hero just to keep him around, but then falls in love with him...but you really can't tell when that actually happened, considering the romance was thrown in near the end of the movie.
The music gets silly at points where you're supposed to laugh. But the dialogue isn't funny, they make fun of Grant for being English (as if that's worse than being Welsh and obsessing over a hill), and it's just hard to keep wondering how long it'll be until this two hours of snoozefest is finished. For a swerve, the picture on the cover of the movie is a more updated one of Grant. They were smart in not showing what he really looked like in the movie on the cover.
The introduction of the movie was awful, but the scenery was pretty.
Definitely rent this one before you decide to buy. Buying this without previously viewing it would be a HUGE mistake.",1017792000,5,1748,4.236526946107785

The challenge united the town under the leadership of ""Morgan the Goat"" (Colm Meaney)and his nemesis, the town vicar, to overcome their mountain's classification by the British Geographical Survey, Hugh Grant, who sees what's going on and comes around to the town's side.
This is supposedly based on a true story which makes it even more interesting.  The soundtrack fits perfectly and reminds me of the ""Chocolat"" soundtrack.  There aren't many extras but for the price, you can't lose.",1013558400,9,727,4.991735537190083

737187,4,6303855466,"If you have been searching for a film with a heavy dose of Welsh spirit, search no more. My father began researching our Welsh roots a couple of years ago and I have since been caught up with all things Welsh. So imagine my delight to find this film set in the period that our first family member made his way across the sea to America. Hugh Grant does a marvelous job in this film, as does his traveling companion. However, it is the charm (and antics) of the Welsh village that carry the film. The film, based on a true story, focuses on two mapmakers sent to measure the ""mountain"" in a small Welsh village. Imagine the horror of the pride filled townsfolk when they hear that their beloved mountain is but a hill! In response, the determined Welsh concoct a ""plan"" that has a life changing effect on the character of Hugh Grant.
The film is a glorious tribute to the spirit of the people of Wales, the land of song. Hugh Grant's character is a spectator whose facial expressions will often mirror your own as the ""plan"" unfolds before your eyes. The Welsh scenery is delicious, and the cast is superb. The occasional use of the Welsh language throughout is, in my opinion, tantalizing. The greatest treat comes at the end of the film when we are taken to the actual spot where these events took place and are introduced to the descendants of those whom this story commemorates. It is very touching and humorous.
A beautiful story in a beautiful setting. In the language of a true Welshman, ""there is wonderful it is!""",1011312000,6,1521,4.494584837545126

In the first 10 minutes, I cancelled all other plans for  that evening, and spent my first commercial break calling friends to tell  them it was on, then spent my remaining commercial breaks surfing to find  it on video.
Movies of similar beauty, heart, and soul include Waking  Ned Devine, Fairy Tale: A True Story, Shakespeare in Love, and The Secret  of Roan Inish. I'm now buying a copy to give my mother as a gift, and look  forward to watching it on our home theater system.

No.  But it does have the perfect picture of a DVD and  the Perfect storyline of a Perfect British (Welsh) comedy. This film was  absolutely spiritual on so many levels.  Not only did it touch upon the  typical ""Why Work Stinks"" theme, but it touches upon Love,  Friendship, Loyalty, and working in unison toward a greater cause than the  mere cause of self.  I am neither eloquent of words, nor even  spelling, but I do know, as a married man, what moves me and what stirs my  spirit towards greatness, and this film inspires both.  If you are an  Historian of WWI, a lover of Britain, or even a lover of the human  condition, then this film belongs...no, DEMANDS...to be in your collection.  The spirit of community manifests itself in this film.  Being that I am a  member of the modern era, the spirt shown here is but a DREAM of what we  should be.  At once the movie is hopeful for what is about to unfold, and  sad; at the thought of what we have lost since the simple times of WW I.

What does it take to enlighten you?  Love?  Honor?  Respect? Humor?  Dignity? This film has all AND MORE.  No  one can experience this film and walk away unaffected unless your heart is  a cold piece of unfeeling ice.  My advice for all macho men watching this  with their wives?
