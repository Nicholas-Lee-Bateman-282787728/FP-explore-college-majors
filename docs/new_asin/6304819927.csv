It's wonderful to see it in it's full, uncut widescreen 2.35:1 glory - the old video pan&scan version wasn't worth  seeing at all. Ian McCollugh's commentary is at times stilted, but  worthwhile nonetheless. All in all, a great DVD of a great movie - horror  fans MUST get this!!!

This mediocre-at-best film is the dull story of a group of people who go to a mysterious island in search of a woman's father and discover that it is overrun by vicious, man-eating zombies.  Director Lucio Fulci constantly bombards us with pointless blood and guts and the even more pointless ocassional naked woman.  He does manage to add some style, but it's lost in the lack of plot and character.  END",895449600,,626,4.768518518518518

931097,5,6304819927,"ZOMBIE (1979) opens in macabre, classic fashion, w/ a ""ghost ship"" sailing into New York Harbor. Hellish death ensues when police board her to investigate. Suffice it to say that this movie goes right for the jugular! A reporter, named Peter West (Ian McCulloch- THE GHOUL, ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST, CONTAMINATION) is put on the story. The daughter of the boat's missing owner, named Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow- ANTHROPOPHAGUS), distraught and looking for answers, teams up w/ West, and the pair heads for a remote, tropical island. Anne's father had been involved in some sort of experiments there. Hitching a ride w/ a couple, named Brian (Al Cliver- THE BEYOND, ENDGAME) and Susan (Auretta Gay) on their boat, the adventure begins. Meanwhile, on the island, Dr. Menard (Richard Johnson- THE HAUNTING) and his wife (Olga Karlatos), give the definite impression that something there has gotten completely out of control. Back on the boat, we are treated to the memorable underwater zombie / shark encounter. This much-ballyhooed scene is indeed amazing, in part because of Ms. Gay's choice in swimwear, and the actual battle between the two flesh eaters! Director, Lucio Fulci certainly shows his flair for the gruesome and bizarre. Fearless when it comes to gore, Fulci gets a chance to shine in this movie, several times! Back on the island, the infamous ""eyeball scene"" unfolds, w/ its maddening build-up, making us wince! Once on the island themselves, our four travelers soon discover an unbelievable nightmare in paradise, where nothing is sacred and no one's survival is guaranteed! Dr. Menard explains the desperate situation they're all in. They have no idea just how bad it's going to get, as science and tribal superstition face off. The ""abandoned graveyard"" scene proves, beyond all doubt, just how much trouble is in store for these people. The greatest strength that ZOMBIE exhibits, is its unrelenting atmosphere of mounting dread and ultimate doom. The further along it goes, the less hope there seems to be. Right up to the finale and apocalyptic epilogue. Not being the biggest gorehundt myself, I still highly recommend this film for its many horrifying attributes!...",1515456000,4,2179,5.15819209039548

931101,5,6304819927,"Movie review:
Zombie (1979), directed by Lucio Fulci, is a classic gory zombie film. The story follows Peter, a reporter looking for a story, and Anne, a woman in search of her missing father, as they travel to the beautiful island of Matool. We meet additional travelers along the way (Brian and Susan), and are treated to an underwater scene of a zombie fighting a shark! Once they reach Matool, they find out the dead are rising from the graves, and must fight for their very lives. Not much to the plot, not surprising for a Fulci film, but the payoff is in the beautiful visuals, fantastic zombie makeup, and wonderfully gory deaths. Zombie is tied with The Beyond (1981) as my favorite Fulci films, and I revisit both of the films at least once a year.

This film is a must see for horror fans, and do yourself a favor and also check out Fulci's The Beyond. (Grindhouse Releasing has a fabulous Blu Ray release of The Beyond)

Product review:
I own the Blue Underground Blu Ray, sadly the single disc edition. The video quality is great, and I just love to take in the images of New York and the island locations. The audio quality is also strong. The only special features on the single disc are a commentary, trailers, and TV/Radio spots.",1504656000,,1246,4.533333333333333

The acting was a bit amateurish and the zombie make-up wasn't the greatest but the the ""gory"" scenes were actually pretty good. There wasn't much of a storyline, but that seems to be the norm for most of the movies in this genre.

It looks like the later part of the film was made in St. Thomas, and it's funny to see how the distant islands plainly seen in some scenes belie the uncharted status of the island.

As a kid it scared me half to death, especially the scene with the doctor's wife hiding in the closet and the almost agonizingly slow trip of her eye ball being pulled towards the wooden splinter. Yet upon re-viewing the movie it was all pretty cheesy. Do not spend any money for this one. The Romero Trilogy is much better. I do not consider Land of the Dead or Survival and the other one part of the original. In summation, if you want to see a good zombie movie watch old Romero flicks, Shaun of the Dead, the remake of Dawn of the Dead, 28 Days Later, Juan de los Muertos and several others out there.",1475798400,,692,4.1716417910447765

932315,4,6304819927,"For a film that likely started out as an Italian cash-in on the successes of George Romero, this now has a place in the extreme-horror canon in its own right. Fulci would prove to be an artful director, and used gore and shocking violence to create a filmic world uniquely recognizable as his own, in this and other, even better extreme horror films. Just as with Romero and his Living Dead series, clueless mainstream critics initially dismissed movies like Zombie  as trash, only to belatedly recognize the fine touches of art and originality that they missed, and end up looking stupid. For gorehounds, the especially rotted, ""out of the grave"" style zombies here have become a Fulci-associated specialty. Considerably  further along the path of death than most of Romero's zombies, they provide even more of an encounter with the end of earthly life, which is one of the functions of horror art. This still is and always will be too shocking and brutal for mainstream film fans or fans of softer horror. And I don't even think it's for most fans of Saw, Hostel  or the Walking Dead series. In my opinion the slickness of such enterprises has nothing to do with the dark, slowly unsettling and much better films of a Fulci or a Romero.",1460160000,,1238,4.722222222222222

ZOMBI was directed by LUCIO FULCI....FULCI is a CHAMPION of the low brow horror trash. ZOMBI was initially conceived as a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead...however Romero wanted to distance himself as much as possible from ZOMBI...and thus ZOMBI became a stand alone film.

IS ZOMBI DISGUSTING? DOES ZOMBI PUSH THE LIMITS OF SO CALLED....GOOD TASTE? IS THE SHARK VERSUS ZOMBI SCENE COOL? Is the island filled with UNDEAD EVIL a metaphor for the NIGHTMARISH PIT OF CAPITALISM? These are the questions that leaves one haunted....deep into the night.....

932502,4,6304819927,"Fulci's ""Zombie"" (actually ""Zombie 2"") is actually a genuinely scary movie, one of the better zombie pictures to emerge from the gates of Hell from which they come (how's that for some hyperbole?). Blue Underground has done a great job with this transfer, as the picture and sound are absolutely fantastic here. The film makes the zombie mythology work for me--exotic locations, Haitian rituals, appropriate music, a lot of gore, and some very beautiful women on display--some clothed, some not! It certainly qualifies as a fun horror movie, with my only criticism being that some of the violence is difficult to watch and over-the-top, but it's a zombie picture and not a kid's film so I will try to meet it halfway on that count. Unfortunately, this copy does not feature any extras other than the trailers and bios, but for a single copy of the movie itself, this was a good purchase (certainly not something that you see on TV movie channels every night).

932602,5,6304819927,"What can I say about this movie that you probably haven't heard? For the sake of those unfamiliar with this film, I'll give you a little plot synopsis. A boat sails into New York Harbor, seemingly devoid of passengers. The harbor patrol boards the boat and one guy gets a hefty part of his neck bitten off by an overweight zombie. The zombie is dispatched by gunfire and falls into the water. The dead harbor patrol officer is taken in for an autopsy. A girl (Tisa Farrow) , who is the daughter of the man who owned the boat, and a newspaper reporter (Ian McCulloch) go to an island in the Caribbean where her father was last seen alive, to solve the mystery. It seems that the island is cursed and the dead are coming back to life. A doctor on the island (Richard Johnson) knows how to stop this plague; shoot 'em in the head. (Sound familiar?) It's not long before the island is full of the walking dead and everyone that is alive is fighting for their lives. Only Ms. Farrow and Mr. McCulloch come out alive and they lock a zombie on board their boat as proof as they sail back to New York. Too late, as New York is full of the walking dead, started by the bitten harbor patrol cop. This film is a notch above the rest of the Italian zombie pics. The photography is sharp, the make-up and gore effects are quite convincing (and graphic!), and the acting is above par this time around. Many critics blasted late director Lucio Fulci for ""borrowing"" other directors' ideas and styles. Maybe he did, but he had his own style which was quite unique and stood out.  One scene is so outstanding, I doubt I'll ever forget it. It takes place after our hero crashes the jeep and the survivors have to flee on foot through the jungle to escape from the zombies. They stumble upon an ancient burial ground of Spanish Conquistadors, which proceed to rise from the grave. It's all very creepy and atmospheric. One zombie even rises from the standing position! Let's also not forget the scene of the wood shard going through an eyeball. I still squirm when that scene comes up. This is one of those films that I could watch over and over without ever growing tired of it. The blood doesn't begin to flow until half the movie has passed, but it is never boring. As close a tribute to George Romero as you can get, with a lot of originality thrown in (even the ""zombie vs. shark"" sequence was used in part of a TV commercial!). ZOMBIE, originally released by Wizard Video on VHS, is available on VHS and DVD from Anchor Bay and a really crappy VHS print from T-Z Video. Also available on DVD from Media Blasters/Shriek Show in a 2-DVD set under the title ZOMBI 2 (the title used for the film overseas). Blue Underground also offers the film on DVD & Blu-Ray in a single disc or double-disc set which is really the only way to watch the film today. It is as near to perfection, both in picture and sound, that you are ever going to get.  Unrated.",1421712000,13,2932,4.377981651376147
932603,4,6304819927,"The first time I recall seeing this movie was in the mid '80s. I had rented it on VHS one weekend. After seeing ""Dawn of the Dead"" in the theater with my older brother, this one was a unique take on the idea of zombies eventually ruling the world. I liked it then and I like it now. It definitely has gore in it for a zombie movie and the shot of the woman getting her eye gauged with a piece of wood from the door is pretty gruesome. Although for today's audiences keen to the Hi Def movies, it will look a bit fake. Hey, there was no such thing as CGI back then in 1979 when this was made, but it still can be believable onscreen.

 They wanted to be as realistic as they could and I think they accomplished that. I have to admit though that any zombies coming out of the ground  being buried for years would not have blood still in them. lol The music and atmosphere is pretty creepy and you get that feeling all throughout the movie, even when the four are out at sea looking toward the island in the distance. You get a feeling of dread, or better yet, dead. lol

 A mysterious sailing boat is found in NY harbor and among it's inhabitants is that of the living dead. After police investigate and one getting himself killed in the process, the zombie is shot multiple times and falls into the water. Later, a woman and reporter join forces to further investigate the boat and her missing father who hasn't been seen in months. They charter a boat that takes them to a remote tropical island named Matoul (may not be spelled correct). The island is rumored to be cursed by the Natives that inhabit it. Nonetheless, they find it after searching and a little sightseeing below the surface of the water. The woman and man that own the boat go along for the ride, but vow they don't want to spend long amounts of time on or near the island. They have all agreed to find the woman's father and then leave. It doesn't take long though before literally all hell breaks loose on the island and the dead are coming back in droves. Even the long dead and buried are somehow coming back to life seeking human victims to kill and devour.  Soon, the survivors have to take refuge in the village's hospital, walled in, fighting for their very survival by any means possible.

932688,5,6304819927,"The confusion with the title notwithstanding, this is one of the best zombie movies ever created (back when zombies were still slow and cumbersome, yet managed to overrun the world anyway).  My favorite scene is the underwater encounter of the diver with a zombie.  Supposedly, this sequence was not conceived by Fulci, nor did he want it included in his film.  The idea came from Ugo Tucci and a diver from Isla Mujeres played the zombie in question.

I like the unflinching way in which this zombie takeover is handled.  It's blunt and to the point.  As far as the `gore' goes, I've seen worse.  You can't expect these zombies to eat with napkins.  Table manners are not required, when you're dead there's no one left to impress.

The plot is fairly uncomplicated.  A boat drifts into New York Harbor with a zombie onboard.  The owner of this boat is missing and his daughter (Tisa Farrow) wants answers so she teams up with a reporter (Ian McCulloch) to find what happened.  They head to the island of Matool and find all sorts of disorder as most of the population is stricken with a strange disease.  The dead walk.  People die and join the throng.

I couldn't wait to add this classic to my collection.  I've watched it several times and plan to watch it many times more.  I adore zombies.",1411862400,3,1295,4.560869565217391
932689,4,6304819927,"Good zombie movie from 1979. But because of the gore , It's not for the squeamish.",1411776000,,82,4.1875
932690,4,6304819927,"Fulci's famous classic, as a matter of fact, the movie he is most known for.  As a fan of Italian cinema and most importantly exploitation films, Fulci's Zombie (1979) is a good gore film with decent special effects, but if you ask me --if its better then any of the American made Zombie movies starting with the Night of the Living Dead (1968) all the way to George A. Romero's franchise, I will clearly declare and without any hesitation say that American made zombie films are much more scarier; hence, better.  Fulci's film lacks the ""scare"" factor that is crucial in the zombie genre.

List of things that made me grade this film with 4 stars:

-Interesting plot/movie setting
-Three good looking ladies (including one who likes to snorkel half-naked...)
-Stunning sequences (e.g. zombie guy fighting a shark while underwater...)
-My type of ending...",1410652800,,856,4.923611111111111

932738,2,6304819927,"After a very brief scene of a wrapped corpse rising up and being shot in the head, the story switches to New York City's harbor, where a derelict yacht is almost hit by the Staten Island Ferry. Local authorities move in and discover no one on board except for a highly deteriorated zombie who bites one of them and then is shot several times and falls overboard. The boat is owned by a famous scientist whose daughter wants to investigate. A New York newspaper reporter is sent to investigate. They team up to find out what's going on, which leads them to the Caribbean in search of an island her father mentions in a cryptic note left on the ship.

An American doctor lives on the island. He had been working with the dad, investigating rumors of the rising of the dead. The doctor wants to find out the scientific explanation for what's going on but the locals credit voodoo practices. Things go downhill after everyone gets together.

The movie is technically impressive. An underwater scene shows a topless female scuba diver at first stalked by a shark, then by an underwater zombie. The scene is well done. I don't know how the actor playing the zombie never let out any bubbles of breath or how they got the shark to follow the girl around how the shark and zombie wrestle each other safely. The violence throughout the film is quite nasty and made me squirm a lot.

But the movie is little more than an exercise in gross-out horror with admittedly impressive special effects by late 1970s/early 1980s standards. The story is extremely basic and has nothing to offer about the whole science vs. magic explanation of the zombies rising. The issue is irrelevant to the movie. It's just a lot of gory violence with a lot of female nudity and a bleak outlook on things. I don't know who I'd recommend it to--maybe fans of HBO's Game of Thrones?",1402012800,,1847,4.574018126888218

932740,5,6304819927,"If Dario Argento is the epitomie of GREAT Italian Giallo film, than Lucio Fulci is the other side of the coin with B-Rate films.  I saw this initially as a rental.  And then bought the spcial 2-disc DVD Edition.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this movie time & again.  Despit it being a low budget, and attempted to take advantage of George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (Hence this movie's title of ""Zombie 2""), this is really a great Low Budget, B-Rate film.
  The Story is good.  The plotline is a bit spotty.  But the film is well known for its ""Shock"" value in several scenes (Fulci was well known for this in most, if not all, of his movies).  The most notorious being the wood splinter in the eye scene.
  The GREAT part about this new Blu-ray edition is that they have included interviews & speakers that they did NOT have in the original Zombie 2 2-disc Edition.  (Like Guillermo Del toro & Fulci's daughter).  And the picture is bright & crisp in this edition!  I was VERY afraid that this would detract from the film, but this is one of the few B-Rate movies that it DOESN'T detract from!
  This edition is well worth your money to buy.  And I look forward to purchasing Lucio Fulci's other movies on blu-ray as well.  Like City of the Dead & House by the Cemetary.",1400889600,4,1268,4.369098712446352

This movie has cheesy effects, VERY poor acting, a retarded ""who cares"" type of story, and is just plain stupid.

used it to watch them. This time I watched Fulci's ZOMBIE.

Everything from the music, to the way the zombies looked absolutely scared me

shtless. The zombies look so real because they're eyes are not open, they are

closed/decayed like they are supposed to be. The film has a real sense of

death about it, and I thought the music was really tense.

I am 26 now, and I have this on VHS, DVD, and now BLURAY.

932768,5,6304819927,"This review is about the Blue Underground Blu-ray release I recently purchased from here at Amazon.

The image on this movie looks amazing. The transfer is one of the most impressive that I have seen in any film.  Everything is crystal clear.  I have watched this movie many times on many different formats over the years, and I am seeing details now that I have never seen before.  The same attention was paid to the sounds as well.  The film sounds great.

As far as the movie itself, what can I say? There is a reason it has such a strong following all of these years later.  It has a feel that is truly unique.  It feels raw, and some of the cinematography is truly great.  Many spots in this movie can be paused, printed out, and used as wallpaper.

It is also filled with classic horror scenes, scenes that will live forever, like the splinter of wood through the eyeball and the great shark vs zombie underwater fight, a scene that was show with a live shark, by the way.  These things alone are worth the price of admission.

Fulci was known for making surreal, dreamlike movies that can be tough to follow with a lot of subtle subtext.  But this is probably his most straight-forward film.  There is not a lot of subtext here.  It is an adventure movie, basically, with characters trying to escape the newly risen dead, so it is very easy to follow.  This might be a plus for people who may have found some of Fuli's other work too hard to follow or too dreamlike.

If you love zombie movies, I feel this is a MUST BUY.  You cannot have a serious zombie collection without Zombie somewhere on your shelf.",1395619200,2,1613,4.391891891891892

While I don't expect there to be a sword swinging heroine given when this was made, I would have liked to have seen at least one women running away. That one chick did escape in the end and helped fight by making fire bombs, but not before she stood while a zombie stumbled toward her in the island clinic/hospital. Can't remember now, but seems that one of the men ran in to rescue her before she got chomped on.

932776,5,6304819927,"Before we begin, let's just go over this one more time: ""Zombi 2"" is actually just called ""Zombie,"" but was marketed in most territories as ""Zombi 2,"" because at the time George Romero's now-classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" was so big that the Italian film board and some others wanted to market the heck out of every zombie movie they could, so Fulci's movie, simply titled ""Zombie"" was changed to ""Zombi 2,"" as in Italy, ""Dawn of the Dead"" was called ""Zombi."" Okay, got that? Long story short: ""Zombi 2"" is not a sequel to anything, and it's actually just called ""Zombie.""

Now then, ""Zombie"" is truly worthy of its title. It pulls a total Tarantino in the first few minutes, showing something that won't occur until much later in the movie first which draws you in immediately making you say: ""Wait, what? Why'd that happen?"" The story is pretty simple, zombies run amok on a tropical island, a group of survivors fight them with disastrous consequences. But it's not so much the story that makes ""Zombie"" a masterpiece, but the cinematography and practical special effects which after so many years don't feel dated and can manage to make gore hounds like me twitch just a little, deep down inside. The ""splinter eye"" scene springs to mind immediately. Another great scene would be the ""Zombie Versus the SHARK"" scene, which I'm pretty sure is the most dangerous stunt ever put on camera-- a real actor in full zombie makeup fights a live shark underwater without the use of any breathing apparatuses for a very long scene that had to have taken several takes and somehow he came out okay. The movie is fantastically transferred to Shriek Show's two disc DVD set, which comes with your very own little poster for the movie!

Criticisms, the dubbing springs to mind, first. The movie was filmed with largely Italian talent, which is cool, so were some of the best Westerns (or in this case, 'Spaghetti' Westerns) ever, but what's weird is, if you watch this movie closely, you'll see that the actors are sometimes dubbed and their lips sync, or that they do not sync. It took me awhile to figure this out, but from what I can gather, the movie was filmed mostly in phonetic English, then in certain scenes, some actors couldn't do that, so they were simply dubbed. But those who were speaking phonetically were still dubbed due to their thick accents. So, to put it simply, ""Zombie"" is a movie that was filmed in English, dubbed into Italian and then completely re-dubbed back into English. This is one thing that is fairly noticeable, not the point that it becomes so distracting that it takes away fun from the movie, but that it does make certain parts feel less immersive or emotionally intense. One other major thing, the box says the movie's runtime is ""223 minutes,"" this is incorrect. The movie is about 94 minutes, the total runtime with two discs of special features is 223 minutes, so it's a bit misleading, but that's okay, too.

There's a certain psychedelic nature to the film, not in the ""Deep Red"" sense, we never set foot in the irreal the way an Argento film might, but the movie feels like a weird trip after a little while. It's easy to lose track of what's going on depending on who is watching, and there are certain things that simply don't make sense for the sake of not making sense, like the zombie on the cover with all the worms in his eye comes out of a grave marked ""Died 1500,"" it's a small wooden grave marker with chalk writing. I know Fulci wasn't exactly going for realism here (it's a movie about hungry walking dead people, after all) though every time I watch the film I have a hard time suspending belief with this scene, as the zombie comes out of a grave about three inches under ground, he's hardly decomposed for a five hundred year old corpse and on top of that my nit-picking nature has to ask if that grave marker is supposed to be the ORIGINAL grave marker that was put in the ground in the year 1500 or if it's supposed to be an updated marker put there by the caretaker of this, what I'm assuming is a Spanish War cemetery in the middle of a tropical jungle.

It's little things like that about ""Zombie"" that get to me, but it's also those things that make it so much fun. And without spoiling anything, I have to say that the film's final scene is one of the ballsiest moves ever made by a set of low-paid extras and a director. The fact that they got away with the final shot of this movie without six dozen people dressed in full zombie garb getting detained is not only a miracle in and of itself, but proof that this film was meant to be. I don't want to give it away, but it's a fantastic visual.

This film was followed by three sequels: ""Zombi 3"" (which is really ""Zombie 2"") then ""Zombie 4: After Death"" (which is actually ""Zombie 3,"" in this case) and a prequel/sequel ""Zombie 5: Killing Birds,"" (""Zombie 4, you see where I'm going with this) though the canonicity of that last one is heavily disputed, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that ""Zombie 4: After Death"" is definitely canonical to the series, especially considering the continuity ""Zombi 3"" takes in conjunction to this film.

All in all, ""Zombie"" is one of the best zombie movies ever made, and it was followed by three 'sequels,' one of which was official, two which were not. I like to refer to these four films as the ""Spaghetti Zombie Quadrilogy,"" as the next film in the series, ""Zombi 3"" is actually ""Zombie 2."" But we'll argue the semantics of the titles of these movies in another review. If you can find a copy of it (which isn't very hard, nowadays, circa 2014) ""Zombie"" is absolutely worth your time if you're a zombie movie fan, Spaghetti Western fan, or just a movie aficionado in general who happens to have a niche for Italian cinema.",1391731200,3,5776,4.517208413001912

This is probably Lucio Fulci's best movie, & most coherent. From a director who was famous for editing one gore scene after another in a barrage of bloody buckets full of dangling guts, with incomprehensible plot dialog scenes in between. Yes, Fulci is the king of the incomprehensible Italian horror films, which seem only to exist to shock & make you cringe at close ups of mass mutilation, or laugh, whichever may be the case. ""Zombie"" or ""Zombie 2"" is no different, other than the acting & dialog is better than his other Zombie & supernatural films. It even has some what of a plot!

Yes, ""Zombie"" has the infamous & unintentionally hilarious, Zombie vs. Shark scene! If sharks have nightmares, this must be it, LOL! Yes, it has the close up of the an eye being oh so slowly penetrated by a splinter of wood! This scene is a good one, it even might make you blink a few times watching it! There is another good scene of old Spanish Conquistadors rising from the ground, worms & all! As for the rest of the film, it's Zombie body munching mayhem as usual, even if they move so slow that it's hard to fathom them out running a slimy slug, let alone human beings.

Even so, this is an entertaining horror film! Really for what it is, it's a lot of fun. Just don't expect it to make much sense. Just roll along with the film. If you do that, you'll have a good time, for the gore & Zombie make up is fairly well done considering the minuscule budget, & after all, how many Sharks have you seen attacked by Zombies!

Even then, the actors all ham it up, the zombies look like they're coated in plastic, and the script fails (you'll find yourself yelling repeatedly at the characters to shoot the zombies in the HEAD, like the doctor told them to).

I enjoy all kinds of horror and this one is just so well done both in the gore genre but also in the way it's structured. In 1979 they wanted a sequel to the classic 'dawn of the dead' movie. So they came up with a prequel instead. As this explains how the zombie epidemic got started. They called this ""zombie 2"" to further show the relationship to the 'dawn movie'. As least that was their intentions. (not George Romero's though, the director of ""dawn of the dead!'.  The print on this one has been restored , it just looks awesome. Better than it's ever looked.

That's how the censors didn't get to chop this up and many shocked americans actually saw this gorefest. Now you can too!

""I'm sorry there are audio issues with the ""Zombie Flesh Eaters."" I've requested the title be corrected as soon as possible.
 Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We look forward to seeing you again soon.""

Not sure how long ""soon as possible"" will take, but I look forward to being able to enjoy this awesome zombie flick in full audible glory and will update this review when/if the sound is ever corrected.",1363305600,,743,4.466666666666667
932984,5,6304819927,"What can I say? I've always liked this film. Ever since I first viewed it back in the mid 90's as a kid.

I grew up on horror. As a matter of fact, one of my first, I think maybe EVEN my first actual full length film that I watched from what I could recall being my FIRST memory of watching a movie, WAS a horror movie.

So I grew up on this stuff.

Anywho, I really liked the gore, angles and setting that Fulci always had to deliver. The jumps and blood and gore in this are far amongst the best that I've ever seen in all of GORE flicks.

The blu-ray quality really makes this pictures jump out with vibrant colors. Making you feel as if you are there in a sense I guess.

I don't have anything much else to say, except...if you don't have this puppy on Blu-rizzle, then you better go out and get it.

Because if you don't...just remember:

""WE ARE GOING TO EAT YOU"".

There is a grand canyon of difference between this cut of the film and the VHS version that I had watched in the past. They went back to the negatives and were faithful to every gory detail of this movie.

My favorite scene is the diving scene that is only second to the eyeball scene. My main complaint of this movie is a common complaint I have & that is the unnecessary wardrobe change they made from boat to island. Almost everyone was wearing different clothes on the island than on the boat. What was the purpose of this? (Perhaps to hide the nudeness of the girl that went diving but, they already showed her almost fully nude so that wouldn't make sense either)  Also, the zombies were slower than Romero's & didn't seem to threatening to me. It had all of the necessary things a zombie movie should have like gore, nudity & a decent back story. With all of the the more the merrier.",1352678400,,828,4.411764705882353

I am a first-time viewer of it, and the dialogue is laughable, the dubbing horrendous, the effects ham-handed and cheesy and it's very hard to feel bad for any of the confoundingly-stupid characters.  Don't get me wrong, I am a Dario Argento fan.  I love corny dubbed Giallo films.  This one was no good mainly because the island setting sucked.  I'm gald fans of this film are getting a good version, but other than that... ugh.  I am new to Lucio Fulci.

933064,5,6304819927,"This film isn't a non stop gorefest.  It's not in the same league as some other zombie pictures that are overloaded with violence from beginning to end.  It starts quickly and begins with a zombie being shot in the head.  Some more gore follows after that, but then the film begins to concentrate on atmosphere and scenery as well as gore. During the first half hour, there's one gory death with a zombie biting someone. However, most of the zombie carnage is saved until the later portions of the film.  Don't get me wrong, the film is loaded with gore and it has plenty of violence.  I'm just saying it isn't one of those films that is all gore from beginning to end without anything else.  I thought it was really well scored with great scenery and atmosphere.  There's also a nice build up as the group travels to the island where the dead walk.  On the way to the island, there's the famous scene when a zombie battles a shark; and then there's that famous splinter in the eyeball scene later on. The Island locations are very well done and deliver excellent scenery and atmosphere. The locations and atmosphere combined with the gore deliver a great late night viewing. As for the nudity, there's some good nude scenes like topless diving and a shower scene.  The zombies look great, and some may think that the film can get scary at times.  I also think the replay value is excellent.

The DVD looks great on this standard DVD.  The animated menu screen with the worms falling out of the zombies eye socket with the music playing is well done. There are radio spots, trailers, TV spots, a poster and still gallery and a Fulci bio for extras.",1347321600,,1648,4.511784511784512

933067,4,6304819927,"This is essentially the same previously released Blu ray version without the second disc (several interviews) at a lower price.

When George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released in Italy it was known as ""Zombie"" so when Italian gore specialist Lucio Fulci made this film it was known as ""Zombie 2."" In England it was known as ""Zombie Flesh Eaters"" which is pretty descriptive. Mia Farrow's look-alike sister Tisa is the headliner here playing the daughter of her missing father and owner of a sailing ship that comes into the NYC harbor with no crew and one zombie.

She heads out to a mysterious Caribbean island, where Daddy was last scene, along with a newspaper reporter (Ian McCulloch with the world's worst comb over) in search of a story. They find a young couple on vacation that is willing to drop them off at the remote island which is allegedly full of walking dead and voodoo mumbo jumbo. There they find Dr. Menard (Richard Johnson) in charge and trying to keep a collection of locals alive.

Once the patients succumb to a mysterious illness, they tend to come alive and have an unquenchable desire for flesh and blood. Menard and his small staff manage to put most of the dead down for good with a bullet to the head, but he's having a hard time keeping up. Sounds pretty dopey right? Well, yes it is. But how many times have you seen a tiger shark and a zombie fight over a nude chick in scuba gear? That scene alone is worth the price of admission.

The movie in spite of terrible, and I mean terrible, acting and a stupid script has some very cool zombies and some very cool zombie kills. The best is the famous shard of wood into a hot chick's eyeball. Ya', you'll squirm. The victims are actually so stupid they deserve to be eaten. I mean these are the slowest moving zombies, you'll ever encounter. This is high camp at its goriest best.

As you might expect the Blu ray package is very good. The video may not be the best out there but they certainly do a good job with the aging film. It is shown in a 1080p transfer with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. There are no jitters or crud seen anywhere and the colors are vibrant, certainly needed with various categories of red blood everywhere...squirting, caking, seeping and pooling. The audio is a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 but the extra channels aren't all that useful. Still the audio is excellent.",1344556800,3,2366,4.518691588785047

But, there is some great zombie action, good 70s style vibes, great zombie makeup and gore, if you are a zombie afficianado like me, then you will definitealy enjoy this.

933102,1,6304819927,"I am not really sure how to begin this review, I enjoyed this movie very much AS A KID,back when my judgement was not exactly a reliable source. However, as an adult I couldn't stand this movie. The character's are annoying,the effects are terrible, the dub actors are horrendous to the point of wanting to stab your ear drums, and even the special effects were nothing short of a joke, and unfunny one at that.

Once this movie starts weknow we are screwed when we get a look at our first zombie, who looks like he just finished eating a jar of cherry jelly. Honetly, the barely even try to make the actor look like a zombie, it was quite patheric. And of course, this being a B horror movie at best, no one in the movie has enough common sense to defend themselves properly and this results in one of the Coast Guard members being killed by the walker because he failed to do anything until the zombie was right on top of him! (GOOD JOB THERE!) After the zombie, and I use this term lightly, bites the coast guard twice it goes upstairs to get shot by a horrible voice actor and falls into the water and very much alive.

*A tip to all of you would-be worriors: When you shoot someone, whom you naturally assume is alive, 5 times in the chest and your target is still standing I advise you to place the 6th between yor targets eyes. Whoops there I go again.....putting more though and consideration into it than the writer did.

We then meet our main characters Peter West, a reporter, and Anne Bowles who's father owned the boat the Coast Guard member died on. When the two sneak on board the ship looking for clues to what exactly happened they discover a letter addressed to Anne. This letter describes to mysterious disease that Anne's father has and how he will never leave 'Matool', and yes that is the name of the friggin island, alive.

Our main characters then quest to this island looking for more information about Anne's father and his disappearance. In order to get on this island they have to travel by boat, so logically you would rent a boat right? WRONG!!!!!! I know what you are thinking ""Well what are they going to do? Just ask a random couple to drive all over the ocean looking for an island that you can't find on a map?"" Well........that is exactly what they do.

*If I were going to look for an island not located on a map, well I would've rented my own boat. At least I would only waste my own time and not a couple on vacation. Darn , there I go again! Actually using that brain thingy. Geez.

While Brian and Susan (the couple) ponders exactly why they let two morons whith no clue on their boat, Susan decides to scuba dive. At this point we are 30 minutes in and have only seen one walker. This being a 1970's horror movie I wonder exactly come next. Of course Susan has to scuba dive almost completely naked.

*At least something is on the up.

Susan encounters a walker that is just, for some insane reason, just hanging out at the bottom of the sea. Instead of having Susan fight the zombie they have the zombie fight a shark. I assume whoever wrote that in was high on acid and thought it would be funny. It's not. The shark manages to damage the boat before swimming off. Convieniently the island they are lookig for is now within seeing distance of their current predicament.

We are then introduced to two new characters, a scientist who's presence is forgettable and his bland and undeveloped character of a wife. (Gee I wonder who will die in this movie? Thinking makes my brain hurt). His wife is upest because she doesn't like living on Dead Island, I can't imagine why. The scientist, ""Dr. Menard"", says ""well I don't care what you think, I am going to continually leave you hear alone,unarmed, and leave this hous completely unprotected. I need to go to the hospital and pretend like I am going to have a career after this movie"". So suprisingly when he leaves her alone again, well just guess. And this is another moment that I couldn't stand to sit through, this woman had no incentive to actually defend herself. She hears a noise, so she automatically knows it is a zombie and instead of, oh I don't know leave! Decides to lock herelf in the bathroom, however the walkers force part of the door open and pull her through.

*Food for thought, if a walker is pulling your delicious face toward his wouldn't you actually use at least one of your arms to prevent the walker from biting you? Well this character misplaced her common sense, resulting in her death. One we don't care about seeing as how her character had about 5-8 minutes screentime total.

Menard meets up with the other characters and he outright tells them the island has zombies on it. Naturally he immediatelty tells them to drive accross the island, unsupervised, to check on his lunch-uh I mean wife. So thegroups agrees without even so much as a ""you sure that is safe, this being a zombie island?"" or a ""I think it would be best if we stayed here so we could get more information on this disease."" The group goes to Menards house and they have to wait until everyone looks at the body before the movie can reveal the left overs-uh I mean body. Brian (the owner of the boat) drives straight into a tree after hitting a walker. I would've hit the breaks and not driven off the road, but then again I use my well developed brain.

The group is forced to walk back to the hospital. The majority of this scene is devoid of all weight as they, for most of the scene, are not even being chased after. When they are, well these walkers move slower than turtles with bricks ties to their legs. So not much weight in this scene. It is also revealed that the walkers that stared all of this are over 200 years old asthey are spanish conquistadors. I am not even going to go into the science of decay rate and how after 200+ years in dirt, there isn't much left. Now before any of you try to fight this arguement, a dead body that comes back as a walker has been dead for a few minutes to an hour. Not 200+ years! The body would have decayed to the point of dust. There would barely even be a body left, left alone a brain so the walker can reanimate.

So they make their way back to the hospital, oh before I forget, Susan was killed. And no one in the audience cares because her character was there so she can be killed. They set up for battle and the idiot nurse encouters two walkers. She has 15-20 seconds to simply just walk around the corner to safety,or find a weapon, but instead she decides to just lean against an OPEN door and scream for help. She dies.

Here is the laughable battle the movie built up to, the group throws about 4 molotovs before the fire actually decides to stay. I am not even joking, they throw one and nothing, a second,third, and then the fourth finally burns stuff. The group escapes and Brian is bit. They let him turn but lock him up in the lower part of the ship so when they go back to NYC people will belive their story. However NYC has been overrun by the slowest zombies in the world. The credits roll and I go in the bathroom and cry.

Trust me, do not see this movie! There is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie. I would rather watch 'House of The Dead' and Highlander 2 in a double feature than this pathetic excuse of a movie.",1337212800,,7292,4.3633014001473835

Picture quality: 4/5

This looks very much improved compared to my old Anchor Bay DVD from 98. The colours, details, blood & gore looks
much better now due to it being restored in 2K. There is 1 problem, though. The film grain. This has over use of DNR and
problems with noise which have mostly replaced the film grain. I think it looks too smooth and waxy in places. Poor decision to
use so much DNR. At least it looks much better than my DVD.

933106,5,6304819927,"This, quite simply, is the greatest zombie movie ever made, and my personal favourite ever since I first saw it when I was 10, and it was still banned in the UK, so I was very happy to see this released on blu-ray.
Zombie has been immortalised thanks to the fantasic transfer, it really does look this good, crisp, clear, colourful, I could go on.
Forget all these new over-hyped zombie rip-offs, there are a lot of loyal fans who will prefer the modern genre and won't appreciate the work that went into Zombie, but this movie is head and shoulders above them, they just don't make them like this anymore, Fulci is a genius.

Zombie is still making fans the world over after 30 years, so that tells you a lot about Fulci's masterpiece, so if you've never seen it, go and get this blu-ray version and see it for yourself.

Having owned both the Anchor Bay release and also the ""25th Anniversary Zombi 2"" disc set, I can tell you that this is the best transfer of the film. The Anniversary disc has serious audio issues. If you play it in anything other than Mono or 2.0 stereo, the audio cuts out half way through the film. The Anchor Bay release is a pixeled mess. The Blue Underground release, on the other hand, it outstanding looking. I saw colors even on the screen I had never seen before in the film. This is coming from someone who owned the original Wizard Video VHS tape as well as also having the Ronan Group Laserdisc. The sound is clear and the picture is sharp and just beautiful, in a gory messy kind of way. If you are a fan of this film, you owe it to yourself to have the best version available and this is it.

My friend had never seen anything like it!  And so, despite living two counties away from us, he came back the next weekend and watched it again!

Then it disappeared from the UK shelves, only to-appear in butchered form - thankfully only for a short while - and then uncut (finally) but in non-anamorphic letterbox presentation.

And now, finally and after years of wishing and waiting...it arrives in full uncut, full 1080p richness.  Unless the studio does some pretty spectacular jiggery-pokery with the original remaining elements I cannot really see this looking any better for some considerable time.

Distributor: Blue Underground (US)

It actually doesn't matter which title you know this movie by, Zombie Flesh Eaters, Zombie, Zombi 2, Island of the Living Dead, Woodoo, the list is probably endless. The film however is instantly recognisable as the greatest Italian zombie classic ever put to celluloid and is widely regarded by many fans as Lucio Fulci's finest hour.

So, what exactly is it that makes this film stand out from countless other releases which all flooded the market when Italian zombie movies were cool?

Filmed on location in the late seventies and starring then popular British actor Ian McCulloch of Terry Nation's post apocalyptic series Survivors, the film has a great deal to like. Scripting is tight and suspenseful providing a genuinely disturbing atmospheric setting which is further enhanced by the now classic soundtrack. What really sets this film apart however are the make up and special effects which have yet to be bettered in the zombie genre over 30 years later. Whether it's the army of decaying zombies slowly rising from the ancient cemetery, or the numerous sequences of outrageous violence and gore, the special effects have ultimately helped to keep this film at the top of most zombie collectors wants lists for over 3 decades.

Presented region free by Blue Underground, this new Blu-ray release is advertised as having undergone extensive remastering from the original negatives in a brand new 2K HD scan and the end result is certain be pleasing to fans of the film. Presented in a 1080p 2.35:1 transfer, detail is sharp with strong colour representation. Background images are especially enhanced particularly towards the final act of the movie and undoubtedly the more familiar you are with the film, the more detail you will suddenly notice popping up on-screen like never before. With a decent amount  of depth also present in black levels, it goes without saying that this movie has never looked as good as it does in its current presentation.

Audio is presented with English DTS-HD 7.1 and Italian DTS-HD 7.1 options. Dialogue appears fresh and clear and the now famous score powers through your speakers providing an enriched atmosphere which will really draw you into the movie. Whether it is the sound of the ever nearing voodoo drums or the final shoot-out in the run down hospital, the audio track here provides a level of depth previously unheard.

Extras begin with a recycled DVD commentary with star Ian McCulloch who actually has some interesting things to say about his experience in making the film, however it is a shame that Blue Underground didn't invest in a new commentary track as McCulloch has attended a number of film conventions since the original was recorded and would probably have much new information and anecdotes to offer. Following the commentary there are a number of different interview segments all running at between ten and twenty two minutes which feature many members of both cast and crew.
Some of the interviews are inter-cut with convention footage of the actors signing posters and artwork for the many waiting fans whilst attending a Q&A session and there are also interviews with the composer who discusses his now legendary score and Lucio Fulci's daughter Antonella. Rounding off the extras package are the usual trailers and TV spots and an extensive picture gallery featuring some classic bloody artwork from around the globe and a handful of rare behind the scenes stills.

All things considered the film is a must own title for zombie collectors everywhere and the improvements in transfer and audio alone instantly justifies a purchase of this Blu-ray release. The film itself has quite simply never looked or sounded better and for a movie which oozes atmosphere, this new presentation will put you right back into the advancing zombie infestation like never before.

This really is one horror classic that richly deserves to be seen in all it's outrageous bloodthirsty crumbling zombie nastiness... oh and if you think you seen the film before...

You ain't seen nothing yet!

933164,4,6304819927,"25 years in a forgotten state, known by few, Lucio Fulci's supposedly ""unofficial sequel"" to Dawn Of The Dead. Zombie Flesh Eaters aka ZOMBIE is another of the gore maestros' ALL YOU CAN EAT zombie gore fests; this time totally uncut and uncensored. The DVD packaging promises the following goodies from two major authority's from the genre.

Gorezone's own Chas Balum says of ZOMBIE; ""As gory as the law allows. Zombie set new standards for eyeball violence. Arterial spurting. Maggot infestations. Topless skin-diving and Zombie table manners."" and legendary FANGORIA magazine reports this movie as, ""An instant Gorehound classic."" and if Gorezone and
Fangoria says it, then it must be true. One would think...

As a fan of B-movies, cult classics and underground horror-gore flicks; pagansadog is here to shed some light on a fairly unknown genre even if it is based on unbiased truths.

For starters, is it even difficult for fans of these films to acknowledge how terribly easy it is for them to end up mostly unaccredited or just forgotten all together? For many Gorehounds ZOMBIE is a zombie/cannibal buffet that causes us to get up and ask for seconds. Rarely though, do most people even finish their first helping of ZOMBIE without excusing themselves from the T.V and lying down for a long 2 hour nap. If you have ever seen the 1964 B&W horror classic I Eat Your Skin (about a writer who arrives on an island in search of Voodoo legends for his novel and unfortunately stumbles onto a secret laboratory of a mad scientist who's experimenting on reversing the aging process...) Then basically you have just seen Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE; albeit the blood gushing and eye-skewering visuals from the latter. It would appear that Fulci was inspired by all Zombie filmmakers and not just Romero when he set about making ZOMBIE. If anything Fulci had a dream to take all stereo-typical zombie films back to their roots and elaborate on the stories.

In a beautiful underwater sequence from ZOMBIE I got the feeling just where Fulci envisioned his zombies should go. A naked skin-diver has an unpleasant encounter with a shark (reminiscent of Jaws) and ends up as zombie food. Zombies under the water, that's right, and the zombie and sharks drive for food brings about a surrealistic showdown between the two massive man-eaters'. While most viewers will consider that to be more copy-cat antics from a want-to-be filmmaker, I consider that scene to be brilliant film-making. So what if Fulci has bitten off of every good film from that time as he has been accused? I see a film-maker who had an unstoppable passion to take horror into the next zone, a zone that incorporates every aspect of what makes us just squirm in our seats and have a bloody good time along the way.

Perhaps Fulci's vision of this was bigger than his breeches or at least larger than his movie income. Once again budget and time restraints quickly had a final say on whether Fulci's outlandish ideas would get the last word or not. The film's hope for success died where it stood and ultimately fell into an unpopular VHS releasing. For more than 30 years ZOMBIE continues to get the cold shoulder amongst a slew of Friday The Thirteenth and Nightmare On Elm Street fans, as well as those who favor George Romero's zombie masterpieces, without the slightest ounce of credit to be praised to Fulci who closely worked with Romero and for making all of their zombie dreams come true. Fulci wanted more blood, more suspense and more love from the people he slaved for. Sadly he would not receive it in the way he envisioned, despite numerous efforts in his movie-making career and with aptly following ZOMBIE in the super gore shocker, The Gates Of Hell (1980) the following year.

Fulci's undying affection to deliver the goods and to please the fans is what insures us that Fulci's horror films will forever be in the homes and hearts of any true Horror-Gorehound's movie collection and why he will forever be known to us as the true Godfather of Gore!",1328832000,,4024,4.807803468208093

In Italy, Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE was regarded as the unofficial sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a>. In fact, to cash in on George Romero's 1978 apocalyptic masterpiece, this film, which made its box office debut in 1979, was even shamelessly bandied about as ZOMBI 2 (Across international waters, DAWN OF THE DEAD was known as ZOMBI). However, Fulci's picture lacks DAWN OF THE DEAD's allegorical perspective and savage satire. It does, however, match it in graphic flesh-rending content. And Lucio Fulci's stuff always did boast that sense of bravura. Who else would feature a three-way underwater scrap amongst a shark, a zombie, and a gorgeous, topless Italian scuba diver (Auretta Gay)? For an actress, as a cinematic claim to fame, this is pretty untoppable.

ZOMBIE's opening and closing scenes of New York City were inserted late in the game so as to tie this venture closer to DAWN OF THE DEAD. The film opens with a sailboat drifting silently in the New York City harbor. When the harbor patrol boards and investigates, they are attacked by a large zombie. Newspaper journalist Peter West (Ian McCulloch) is assigned to cover the sailboat murders. Peter runs into a woman named Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), whose missing scientist father owns the sailboat. Their doggedness would lead them to the sweltering Caribbean isles, and specifically to the dreaded Matul island, site of local voodoo superstition and a doctor (an unhinged Richard Johnson) conducting unsanctioned experiments. And, really, that's probably more of a plot breakdown than one requires. Cue the unholy feasting.

Looking back, those two holidayers, Brian and Susan, should never have given Peter and Anne a boat ride to the Matul island. I'm fairly certain what they experience on Matul won't make it into any scrapbook.

Running at 91 minutes, this DVD offers the uncut and uncensored version. The zombie attacks, set to a throbbing score, are sensational, explicit, splattery. You've probably heard talk of the memorable above-mentioned shark vs. zombie sequence and of the infamous eyeball penetration scene. But it's pretty much sick puppy mayhem from start to finish. Take your pick: Our tourists, tired of running for their lives, come to rest at a graveyard hosting the rotting remains of Spanish conquistadores, and you suspect it won't be long before the earth spits out its restless dead. The hospital in which the strung-out doctor toils inevitably transforms into a charnel house. The corpse of the doctor's beautiful boozy wife becomes a buffet for the ravenous undead. Renowned make-up artist Giannetto De Rossi turned in amazing cosmetic work for this one. Somewhere, Tom Savini's jaw must've dropped to anaconda-like proportions. And if you're a red-blooded dude, there are other scenes worth checking out, namely those with the two beauties, Olga Karlatos and Auretta Gay, baring their tops (in a languorous shower scene and the scuba sequence, respectively). Lucio Fulci may've been the Maestro of Gore, but he knew how to stack the deck.

The DVD's bonus material consists of two theatrical trailers (U.S. and International), TV and radio spots, poster and still galleries, and a Lucio Fulci bio. You're given the option of watching the film in either its original Italian dub (with English sub-titles) or in the English dub.

As much as I love this movie, I watched it with my girlfriend and she hated it.  If I was being honest to myself, this really is a bad movie, the plot is weak, the people are stupid (for some bizarre reason everyone who sees a zombie just freezes and screams while the slow moving zombie walks up on them, when they could easily out run it or a group of them).  So why give this 5 stars, because its a great gore film, its basically gore scene built up on gore scene (including a ridiculous zombie vs shark scene). So for people who are accustomed to watching the new zombie movies, skip this one for now, at least go watch the original Dawn of the Dead first and this rent this one, but for fans of cheap Italian gore films get ready for a great synth scored gore (although every one of those people have already seen this).

933170,5,6304819927,"<strong>Zombi 2</strong> (Lucio Fulci, 1979)

I have reviewed <em>Zombi 2</em> before. In fact, I've probably written more column inches on this movie in the past twenty-five years than any other. I have owned seven different copies of it, it's one of the less-than-a-dozen movies I can confidently say I've seen more than fifty times, and it's pretty high up in my list of the best movies of all time (as I write this, it currently sits at #136). And yet here I am reviewing it again. Why? Because I got to see it on the big screen for the first time in many, many years on Oct. 15, 2011 in a brand-new (and opening theatrically in selected American cities on Oct. 22) restoration from Blue Underground, and this restoration deserves recognition. It's obviously been a long, long time since I've seen the original print, but from what fuzzy memories I still have, this actually looks better than the original. And it certainly sounds better. More on that in a few.

If you've somehow managed to avoid seeing one of the most iconic modern horror films, here's a quick plot synopsis: we open with a guy, whom we later discover is Dr. Menard (<em>The Haunting</em>'s Richard Johnson), shooting a sheet-wrapped bundle struggling to get off a cot, after which he speaks one of the great opening lines in movie history: ""The boat can leave now. Tell the crew."" We have no idea to whom he's speaking, or why, but we soon figure out what boat he's talking about, for it shows up, abandoned, drifting into the path of the Staten Island Ferry just a few frames later. The Coast Guard board it. While exploring, they discover the movie's first zombie in the hold, resulting in the death of an officer. Obviously, this is news, so a local reporter, Peter West (<em>Survivors</em>' Ian McCulloch), is assigned by his editor (Fulci in a cameo) to go down to the dock and check it out. While there, he meets Anne Bowles (<em>Manhattan</em>'s Tisa Farrow), the daughter of the boat's owner, who's looking for any clues about where her father may have gotten off to. The two of them uncover evidence that leads them to Matool, an uncharted island somewhere in the Antilles. With the help of a couple of American tourists on vacation, Brian Hull (<em>The Beyond</em>'s Al Cliver) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay, in the second of the only four movies she made in her career--all of which came in 1979-80), they set off for the island, and soon find that all is not well. Not well at all, in fact. The doctor and his beautiful, drunk wife (model Olga Karlatos, who would later turn up in <em>Purple Rain</em>, of all places) are under siege from the walking dead, who used to keep to the other side of the island, but are now encroaching on their turf. And here we have four clueless Americans about to get caught in the middle...

I don't need to tell you how good <em>Zombi 2</em> (aka <em>Zombie</em> in America and <em>Zombie Flesh Eaters</em> in Britain) is. Rare is the horror fan who hasn't seen this movie. I do need to tell you, however, about this restoration, which easily makes it worth going to see this movie on the big screen, even at full ticket prices. If you're familiar with Italian horror and giallo films of the seventies, you know that one of the trademarks of same was the bright red fake blood some Italian company made millions manufacturing by the metric ton during those years. That was how you could tell the prints of <em>Zombi 2</em> that were used to make every video release from the initial VHS copy to Anchor Bay's 25th Anniversary DVD of the film were off; the blood just doesn't look right. (Actually, it looks righter than fake blood usually looks, but it's got a weird orange tint to it that I've never quite understood.) It does in this print, and that's amazing. The video isn't crystal clear--I'm assuming there's only so much one can do with restoration equipment--but it's probably as close as we're ever going to get. And maybe the blurriness of the opening scenes in New York City are smog, anyway, right? It still looks a dozen times better than it did before. You can make out the individual legs on the millipedes crawling on the piano in the boat!

But all of that, as wonderful as it may be, pales in comparison to what some nameless genius(es) did with the sound. If possible, I'm even more familiar with Fabio Frizzi's music than I am with the film itself. The main title theme of <em>Zombi 2</em> is iconic, just as much as is John Carpenter's theme for <em>Halloween 2</em> or Goblin's main title for <em>Profondo Rosso</em> or Mike Oldfield's <em>Tubular Bells</em>, all of which rank among the greatest single pieces of film music ever created. (I say ""single pieces"" to distinguish them from full scores; the rest of Frizzi's soundtrack to this film is mediocre at best.) It's a textbook on how well simplicity can work in creating a piece of music. Aside from those seven copies of the movie I've owned, I've had the soundtrack on cassette, CD, and MP3, bootleg and official copies. I've never heard it sound half as good as it did this last go-round. The words of the horrible disco song in the boat scene (which, it turns out, is Linda Lee's ""There's No Matter"", penned by Frizzi and some associates and released in 1977--since I spent a quarter-century trying to track it down, I figured I'd let you have the answer free) are actually halfway intelligible. A lot of ambient noises I'd never caught before were easily heard (the biggest difference here: the Conquistador graveyard scene. Lots of rustling!). I can't say enough wonderful things about the sound restoration. That alone would make it worth the price of a movie ticket, if you're lucky enough to have it come to a theater within driving distance of you.

And if you've never seen this film, which contains some of the most famous shots in horror-movie history (the zombie-vs.-shark battle, the infamous splinter-through-the-eye scene that got the film banned as a video nasty in Britain and forced its release in the United States to be unrated, etc.), this upcoming American theatrical release is by far your best opportunity to do so since 1980. It is in no way a perfect film; it's a piece of low-budget exploitation. No one involved in its making took it too seriously (Fulci himself, who was fond of applying make-up to his extras with a trowel, called the zombies ""walking flowerpots""); filmgoers would be advised to adopt the same attitude. But silly dubbing, competent-in-its-best moments acting (Karlatos is gorgeous, but can't act her way out of a paper bag), and trowel-applied makeup are no match for Fulci's methods of filmmaking, which were unheard-of at the time. (I can't remember which actor said it, but one of them once commented that the hospital set was the dirtiest s/he had ever worked on, and that grime is one of the things about the movie that lends it the air that ""holy [censored for Amazon consumption], if a zombie apocalypse ever did happen, it would be JUST LIKE THIS!"")

933205,5,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci is a name most horror and zombie fans are familiar with. As an Italian horror director, a good portion of his work either slipped under the radar or went on to become a cult classic in the states. Films like City of the Living Dead, The House By the Cemetery, and The Beyond, but Zombie is more than likely the most recognized Fulci film. Also known as Zombie Flesh Eaters and Zombi 2, Zombie was originally planned as a sequel to Dawn of the Dead. Unlike most direct to DVD sequels that try to jump the shark or a low budget sequel that goes straight to Syfy, Zombie is not only worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as Dawn of the Dead, but may actually be a better film in general and the best of Fulci's work period.

Fulci films are notorious for gloriously realistic gore scenes while being fairly light in the story department and having some pretty rigid acting. Zombie seems to be the best-rounded Fulci film and makes the most out of all of his strengths. It's certainly in the vein of Dawn of the Dead and is more than a worthy successor. It does have its fair share of overacting that usually falls onto the shoulders of the two main supporting actresses Auretta Gay and Olga Karlatos but it's also easy to overlook. If you're a zombie fan, the story is compelling and the kills are memorable. The eyeball scene is one of the best in the history of horror and a zombie fights a shark under water. Does anything else really need to be said other than that? It's as if Fonzie somehow missed that infamous jump over a shark on water-skis and has been lying on the bottom of the lake waiting until a nude scuba diver swam his way to try and gain some revenge.

The make-up effects are generally really amazing for the time the film was produced; the graveyard scene being the best example. That zombie with the worms in its eye has become iconic. That specific zombie's death may be an even better example of how gore in a low budget horror film can outshine just about anything in most higher budgeted films. The camera work is also key to a film like Zombie. The lighting is actually really fantastic and seems to be just right at all times, but the camera is always just in the right place after a zombie gets smacked in the head to spit a spray of blood into the camera. A POV shot is also used occasionally from the zombie's perspective. The main use of this technique that comes to mind is in the graveyard when a zombie is coming up out of the ground and you see dirt falling away from the line of vision as the camera rises up. The last shot may be the most incredible of the film, especially once you learn how the shot was acquired; the mass of zombies on the bridge in New York. It literally leaves you with no hope for humanity, which is pretty much the most definitive ending any zombie movie could ask for.

Like most early horror films, Zombie isn't without its flaws. There's still quite a bit of overacting and the technique of zooming in closer and closer on someone's face whenever something gross or shocking is discovered gets a bit tiresome. But Zombie offers exactly what every horror fan loves; plenty of gore, excellent practical effects, a fairly decent story, and quite a bit of nudity. Zombie can definitely be considered a triumph for its time and is a bloody terrific zombie masterpiece from beginning to end.

This two disc set has a massive list of extras, so try to bear with me. The first disc includes audio commentary with star Ian McCulloch and Diabolik Magazine Editor Jason J. Slater, two theatrical trailers, two thirty second TV spots, four radio spots, a poster & still gallery, and the Guillermo Del Toro Intro. Disc two includes a plethora of interviews from just about everyone in the cast that you can imagine. Zombie Wasteland is 22 minutes long and is the thirty year reunion of the cast at a few horror conventions. It includes interviews with cast members Richard Johnson, Ian McCulloch, Al Cliver, and Ottaviano Dell'acqua. Flesh Eaters on Film is an interview with co-producer Fabrizio De Angelis and runs 10 minutes long. De Angelis brings up how difficult it was to work with Fulci, how he made three to four movies with Fulci when no other producer could stand him after one film, and Zombie being successful among other things. Deadtime Stories includes interviews with co-writers Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti and is 14 minutes long. World of the Dead has interviews with cinematographer Sergio Salvati and production and costume designer Walter Patriarca in a 16 minute segment. Zombi Italiano features interviews with special make-up effects artists Gianetto De Rossi & Maurizio Trani and special effects artist Gino De Rossi. The feature runs for 17 minutes as these artists walk you through laughing at their first make-up attempt on a zombie, how they retrieved a shark, pulling off the splinter in the eye scene, Fulci always wanting entrails, and the bridge scene being stolen; no permits and causing a traffic jam. Notes on a Headstone is a seven minute interview with composer Fabio Frizzi, All in the Family is a six minute interview with Fulci's daughter Antonella, and Zombie Lover is a ten minute feature with Guillermo del Toro has he explains why he loves the film.

The 2-Disc Ultimate Edition Blu-ray of Zombie is presented in 1080p HD resolution in a widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Audio is available in both English and Italian in 7.1 DTS-HD, 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX, and original mono. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Francais, Espanol, Portugues, Deutsch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai. Zombie was originally released in 1979 and its duration is approximately 92 minutes long. The two-disc set is available in retail stores and most online retailers now.",1320624000,7,5789,4.671568627450981

A reporter (Ian McCulloch) and a young woman (Tisa Farrow) go in search of a missing scientist as they head off to the Caribbean Islands where they must solve the mystery, yet, somehow a mysterious curse is causing the dead to rise from their graves as they come back as flesh-eating monsters.

A terrific and hugely beloved Italian horror fave from the legendary Lucio Fulci as it's one of his best movies and his most popular movie ever. Fulci was fresh from doing thrillers, comedies, action movies and even westerns as he tackled on the horror genre and made a film that was intended to be an unauthorized prequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" but more inspired yet came out at the same time as ""Dawn of the Dead"". What sells this movie is that moody memorable soundtrack to the atmosphere that gives you the chills, the film is notorious for it's shocking scenes of gore mainly the famous scene where a large broken piece of wood splinter goes through a woman's eye. The ending was a nice twist i should say, the film is very George Romero meets Val Lewis's 30's zombie movies as it's one of the best horror movies ever and one of the best movies in zombie cinema.

This 2-disc Blu-Ray offers a terrific high def transfer on the picture and some very good sound to it thanks to Blue Underground. This movie comes with goodies such as audio commentary, trailers, TV spots, radio spots, featurettes, documentary and even an insight on why this is one of Guillermo Del Toro's fave movies of all time.

Glad I took the risk with Zombie. This two disc blu ray set is phenominal!! This is a region free blu ray, so fans in other countries can enjoy this gory flick in all its uncut glory! The 2.35 image is the best it has ever looked in the home video market. My only complaint is the lack of blacks. Too much contrast was used for a brighter picture where the blacks aren't deep. But the detail and color make up for that! The image could be better, but this is the best it has looked so far.
While the 1080p video looks good, the soundtracks are just as good. You get to choose from English or Italian 7.1 DTS-HD, English or Italian Dolby Digital EX (6.1), or English or Italian mono. And the greatest thing about this: Blue Underground FINALLY included English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack! Don't recall BU ever putting subtitles on their titles (let me know if I'm wrong) for the foreign language soundtracks. To me, the Italian tracks sounded fuller where as the English tracks were bright and thin.
The second disc is the special features all in HD! So the foreign market won't have to worry about NTSC to PAL conversion for standard definition playback.
This is one of the best releases Blue Underground has released so far and I hope they keep up the great work!
Lucio Fulci's Zombie always rocked, now it rocks even harder!

Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), hasn't heard from her father in months and the last she heard of him was that he was on a remote island called Matoul. Reporter Peter West (Ian McCulloch), has been assigned by Gotham newspaper to investigate the bizarre homicide that took place on the derelict boat found in the New York harbor. Anne and Peter join forces as they set off to find her father and the truth about the living dead found on the boat in the harbor. They set off for Matoul and they run into a vacationing couple on a boat Brian (Al Cliver), and Susan (Auretta Gay), who come along for the ride. They encounter Dr. Menard (Richard Johnson), once they arrive on the island and it doesn't take long before all hell breaks loose.

Zombie was written by Dardano Sacchetti as an action/adventure thriller before George Romero's Dawn of The Dead was released in Italy. Dario Argento would re-cut Dawn of The Dead for Italian audiences and rename it Zombi. The success of Zombi in Italy Dardano Sacchetti's script would be reworked by Elisa Briganti to more resemble Romero's movie making Zombie (Zombi 2) a sequel in name only.

Lucio Fulci has always been able to create tension and atmosphere in his films creating nightmarish visions on minuscule budgets. Zombie isn't filled with great performances, but then most of Lucio Fulci's work from the late 1970's on isn't about the actors as much it is about using the actors as objects to achieve his vision. Zombie is filled with some of Lucio Fulci's goriest set pieces included the eyeball being forced on a splinter sequence. Sergio Salvati who has worked as cinematographer on ten Lucio Fulci films and on Zombie he serves up a visual feast as he uses every inch of the frame to capture all the carnage. Through the years Lucio Fulci's Zombie has built up quite the reputation making it a fan favorite and one of the zombie genre's all time classics.

The BluRay:

Zombie comes on a 25 GB single layer BluRay. The film is presented in a 1080 progressive anamorphic widescreen. Colors have never look as vibrant as they do for this transfer, also black and contrast levels look consistently strong throughout. Details generally look crisp and there are no problems with compression. It should be noted that though grain is evident throughout, there are a handful of moments in which its look likes some DNR has been applied to the image.

This release comes with six audio options, a 7.1 DTS-HD mix in English, a 7.1 DTS-HD mix in Italian, a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX mix in English, a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX mix in Italian, a Dolby Digital Mono mix in English and a Dolby Digital Mono mix in Italian. There are a multitude of audio options to choose from and all of the them are in very good shape and for purists the original mono mixes have been included. New to this release are a pair of 7.1 DTS-HD mixes in English and Italian respectively. Channel separation of these two mixes is extremely good and the lower end frequencies are also well represented. This release comes with ten subtitle options, English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portugus, Deutsch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.

Extras for this release are spread over two discs.

Extras on disc one include a brief intro before with film with filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro, a poster & still gallery, four radio spots, two T.V. spots and two trailers, international trailer (3 minutes 45 seconds - anamorphic widescreen) and U.S. trailer (1 minutes 33 seconds - anamorphic widescreen) and a audio commentary with actor Ian McCulloch and Diabolik magazine editor Jay Slater. Outside of few moments of dead silence, this is actually a pretty good audio commentary that provides a lot interesting information about this film.

Extras on disc two (25 GB Blu-Ray) include eight featurettes, `Zombie Wasteland' - interviews with actors Ian McCulloch, Richard Johnson and Al Cliver and actor / stuntman Ottaviano Dell'Acqua (22 minutes 19 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in English & Italian with English subtitles), `Flesh Eaters on Film' - interview with producer Fabrizio De Angelis (9 minutes 39 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles), `Deadtime Stories' - interviews with co-screenwriters Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti (14 minutes 30 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles), `World of the Dead' - interviews with cinematographer Sergio Salvati and production / costume designer Walter Patriarca (16 minutes 29 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles), `Zombie Italiano' - interviews with special make-up artists Gianetto De Rossi and Maurizio Trani and special make-up artist Gino De Rossi (16 minutes 34 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles), `Notes on a Headstone' - interview with composer Fabio Frizzi (7 minutes 25 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles), `All in the Family' -interview with Lucio Fulci's daughter Antonella (6 minutes 8 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles) and `Zombie Lover' - Guillermo Del Toro shares his thoughts on Zombie (9 minutes 37 seconds - anamorphic widescreen, in Italian with English subtitles).

Topics discussed in these eight featurettes include, the lasting legacy / popularity of Zombie, make-up and special effects - the shark and the eye ball scenes, what is was like to work in Italian cinema in the late 1970's and early 1980's, guerilla style filmmaking - like how they were able to steal the shot on the zombies crossing over the bridge, the origins of the screenplay - including a once proposed western / zombie hybrid, how Lucio Fulci became involved with this film, how this film changed Italian horror films, production related topics like - the visual look of the film, the sets and creating a new zombie, audience reaction to the film, the score and all the participants discuss what it was like to collaborator with Lucio Fulci. The interview with Antonella Fulci is well balanced discussion about who Lucio Fulci was in his personal life and professional life, while the interview with Guillermo Del Toro is nothing more than a super fan discussing how he became of a fan of this film.

In all there is a lot of ground covered in these eight featurettes, which were all put together by Red Shirt Pictures, who are without a doubt the best company currently working on special features for Cult movie releases. Overall Blue Underground gives Zombie its strongest home video release to date.

Note: Blue Underground are also releasing Zombie on DVD.

933234,3,6304819927,"(Update, Dec. 2 2012: The United Kingdom's Arrow Video gave this film a brand new HD master from the original camera negative, opting not to use LVR's scan, and it's everything the Blue Underground Blu-ray should have been. It is, however, locked to Region B. Go to DVD Beaver to see the screenshot comparisons. Once I get an all-region player, I'll be picking up the UK BD and selling off Blue Underground's as quickly as possible. I hope paying customers will take note of how much better and more filmic this new HD scan is and why the Italian scan is such a letdown. Here's hoping for more Italian cult films to be handled right.)

(Update, Nov. 1 2011: When I originally wrote this review, I hadn't yet seen the disc in motion, basing my opinions on uncompressed screencaptures on Rock! Shock! Pop!'s review and also on having seen many of these LVR transfers on Blu-rays I've purchased, which eerily all exhibit similar problems. I've since seen the Blu-ray, and have amended my review and given the title a higher rating, although my gripes with LVR withstand.)

Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" (Zombi 2) is a definitive classic of the genre. Originally intended as a pseudo-sequel to ""Dawn of the Dead"" (""Zombi"" in Italy), the flick is far removed from Romero's film, zombies aside. Fulci shows his usual love of elaborate and sometimes shocking gore effects, thick atmosphere, and lush cinematography. It does not have the surrealistic elements that defined his Gates of Hell trilogy (""City of the Living Dead"", ""The Beyond"", and ""House by the Cemetery""), but does feature certain dreamlike scenes that will undoubtedly captivate. The film is a masterpiece, but the Blu-ray is a bit of a disappointment.

It's been revealed recently that the Rome-based company responsible for these video masters is LVR Digital Post Production. Other people who know their stuff far better than I do could tell you exactly why the equipment they use is screwing up the look of these films so much, but it has something to do with their less-than-stellar scanning equipment which uses the ancient cathode ray tube as a crucial component. This is not state-of-the-art equipment nor should it be used today for the preservation of film.

The main issue is that the scanner seems to work in such a way where the film grain is on the forefront, somehow prioritizing its importance and detail over the rest of the image, leaving everything else rather murky and devoid of any fine detail. What you get is an image that is clustered with unnatural-looking grain that looks more like video noise, and ""behind"" the grain (it's not REALLY behind since the grain makes up the image) is a hazy, sterile, undetailed mess. There was some speculation that LVR has blasted these titles with DNR and added a layer of artificial digital grain on top to compensate--and, indeed, it appears as if they've done just that on some of the titles (just look at the smeary, waxy mess that is ""The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue"")--but it seems more likely in most cases that what's amiss is simply LVR's outdated equipment is scanning these film materials (negatives, interpositives, whatever it is they're using) all wrong.

Hi-res digital scans--2K, 4K, and so on--are intended for the futureproofing and preservation of original film materials, which WILL NOT be in great shape nor last forever, and when an authoring house is not preserving these films properly, someone needs to either tell them to get their stuff together, or film distributors will need to start giving these film materials to someone else. Blue Underground and Arrow Video seem content to transfer these video masters to Blu-ray, but I think they ought to stand up for not only the preservation of film history but also for the sake of giving quality products to their customers by telling these guys to step things up and stop making less than ideal telecines (the process of transferring film to video).

And whether just an inherent problem with the way these films are scanned or additional tweaking by those responsible for making these telecines, the contrast appears to be completely out of whack. These transfers are so bright! Fine shadow detail is being lost. Don't believe me? Google ""kentai psa grain noise"" and compare the shots at full screen, particularly the two shots of the woman descending the stairs and pay close attention to the grooves and marks on the walls. This loss in detail is NOT due to poor screencapturing or ""doctoring"" of these images; this is how these titles look!

Something needs to be done, and people need to be made aware that these films are not looking the way they ought to. It's rather ridiculous that the Blu-ray for ""Troll 2"", which is a crap Italian film and likely didn't have a whole lot of money thrown at its transferring, looks a heck of a lot better and more film-like than these CLASSIC, well-made Italian films being put out by Blue Underground and others. And not all of these transfers look bad; BU's ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" and ""The Stendhal Syndrome"" look very nice, despite the brain-piercing, noise-like veneer of grain, especially on the latter. But even these two great transfers are flawed and could be improved upon. These are NOT simply the way these films look; there's a definite problem at the telecine stage. And certainly, Blue Underground are encoding these LVR video masters far better than the likes of Arrow Video and Media Blasters, but what good is that if the masters themselves don't look so hot? ""A turd in a tux"" comes to mind...

I can't tell people how to spend their money, though I would recommend people become aware of these problems and make informed decisions, and to email Blue Underground and others involved about these problems, which BU insist are not problems at all. I adore many of these Italian cult classics to death, but I may not keep shelling out for these Blu-rays so long as they continue to look like this. I hope things will be taken care of and these movies done justice at some point, hopefully with properly-done BD re-releases for the films which are afflicted. Sadly, it seems highly unlikely that LVR will ever update their equipment. Their scanner would have cost a pretty penny, somewhere around the one million dollar mark, so to have them dump it in favor of another is sadly probably just a dream.

In the end, the transfers aren't TERRIBLE and will surely please most viewers, myself included. They certainly could be a whole lot better, but for the most part there is a good deal of detail to be seen. I'd like people to be aware of these problems, but I don't do so with the intent of swaying others from purchasing the Blu-ray Discs. It's possible that this may be the absolute best quality we will ever see these movies, and I'd rather have a flawed but decent-looking title in HD over not having that title in HD at all (unless we're talking ""Burial Ground: The Night of Terror"", which has grain that looks more like high definition chroma noise, and the film is missing frames at every cut, about two minutes of missing frames in total; yeah, screw you, Media Blasters or whoever was responsible for that one). There's certainly a gigantic step up from previous ""Zombie"" DVDs, not just in detail but in color reproduction as well. And when it comes to this Blu-ray, that's where LVR really nailed it: the color timing is GORGEOUS, largely due in part to the cinematographer's involvement with the restoration. Now if only somebody would go back and tweak LVR's ""Deep Red"" transfer and re-release it so that it looks more in tune to Anchor Bay's DVD rather than the overtly yellow Blu-rays...

I'm pleased with this ""Zombie"" Blu-ray, but there's a lot of room for improvement. Italy, please begin preserving your rich film history by better means.",1318809600,18,7818,4.805947955390335

All films by the likes of Lucio Fulci, Dario Argento, John Carpenter, Don Coscarelli, & George A Romero should have all there work put out on Blu ray mostly cause there films are beyond a horror genre there living breathing Art!

I'll get to the point
Fulci's Zombie is a Ground Breaking Over the top extreme gore filled epic zombie flick
I've owned every Digital version so far (Payed 60 Dollars for the ""Original"" Uncut laserdisc 10 years ago along with 3 different DVD cuts
so the asking price for 28.00 for the Two Disc BR is a great price

The Plot could easily be the back story to the Romero's Dead Series.
Unlike George Romero's zombie films  Fulici's Zombie is missing any social commentary which can be forgivable...........
There isn't many Zombie films where you see a zombie fighting a hammer head shark the gore and extreme over the top violence is crazy
This Film would now be given a NC-17 if released in theaters
People new to the  zombie genre thanks to AMC's The Walking Dead will Love it or hate it

Hopefully  Hollywood will not go and re-make this film
It can Not be done right in this day and age of all the over used CGI and lack of practical effects in sci-fi & horror now a days
A re-make would just be another gimmicky Resident Evil live action flick

933277,4,6304819927,"After watching ""Zombie"" and having perused a number of reviews, I'm more convinced than ever that there are two distinct schools of thought regarding zombie movies.  There's the Romero school (of which I'm definitely a member); and there's the Raimi school (of which I'm definitely not a member).  The differences between the two schools are distinct and, in my opinion, noteworthy.  The Romero school is best characterized by social awareness and a genuine pathos for both the zombies and their victims.  The Raimi school is best characterized by grossness, gore and a minimal empathy with either the zombies or the victims.  Now, of course, zombies would necessarily be completely gross entities, with worms, rotting flesh and oozing pus and slime - exactly as both Sam Raimi and Lucio Fulci depict them. This is not to say that George A. Romero in any sense glamorizes or sanitizes them; his zombies hold their own with the best of them.  But he doesn't over-emphasize their grossness or dwell on it to the point that the viewer completely loses sight of the fact that they were once living, breathing humans.  With Raimi and Fulci you get the impression they were always hideous, gross beings from beneath the ground, without any redeeming characteristic.  And I truly think this is the most significant difference between the two views.  No matter how many people they tear apart and eat, Romero's zombies retain a certain innocence; whereas Raimi and Fulci's zombies exude a truly sinister, even evil, aura.  Again, the latter's focus is on the pure horror of the situation; whereas the former's focus is primarily on the absolute misfortune that has overtaken zombie and victim alike.  Watching a Fulci (or Raimi) film, you come away thinking ""Couldn't have happened to a more deserving lot!""; watching a Romero film, you come away thinking something like ""Why do such bad things have to happen to essentially good people?""  The Romero type of zombie film draws the viewer in, making him or her more attuned to the emotional dynamic; whereas the Fulci/Raimi type of film tends to hold the viewer at bay, letting him or her concentrate primarily on the purely physical element of the movie - which is why you rarely encounter the eye-gouging or gut wrenching or limb severing type of attack in a Romero film that are the very hallmark of a Fulci/Raimi film.

Of course, this admittedly somewhat artificial breakdown doesn't really apply to zombie comedies; and falls apart entirely when it comes to truly unique and original takes on the zombie genre, such as the ""Resident Evil"" series or the ""28 Days After"" series.  Both of these focus almost exclusively on the ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy"" dynamic, with the poor zombies hopelessly out of their element.  They're just along for the ride.",1310860800,,2796,4.944444444444445
933278,5,6304819927,"If one must speak of the Citizen Kane as far as zombie films concerned, I think one would probably mention either Romero's Dawn of the Dead or Fulci's Zombie. In fact, I almost hate to mention both in the same sentence as they are two different works of art & have very little in common although Zombie was marketed as a sequel to Dawn of the Dead only in Italy.

Fulci was, hands down, the king of splatter films in his time & I don't think there are many directors living or dead who could create such disgusting/revolting classics such as Zombie. Needless to say, I've seen a few Fulci films here & there but this must be one my absolute favorites.

We are going to eat you.

Ok, so maybe that grabs your attention. I know it grabbed mine when I was 14 & I once owned an old VHS copy of this when Wizard video granted us all the classic Grindhouse films back in the late eighties. One couldn't help but notice all the gruesome artwork which delights every lunatic horror fan with a lust for gore.

Fulci lives! Thanks to the Gods of DVD!!!

This time, Fulci takes us to the Caribbean to give us a thrill-a-minute with flesh eating voodoo zombies. Trust me, these are the ugliest zombies I have ever seen. Here, the zombie epidemic is growing & a doctor desperately searches to remedy the problem.

Although I hardly think viewers will give a damn about the plot, I am confident they will love the gory special effects. What Fulci lacked as far as plot goes, he more than made up for with intense violence & blood galore. Fulci really raised the bar on this one & zombie enthusiasts everywhere can only salute one of the Italian masters of horror. We can enjoy this film for years to come thanks to Anchor Bay, Blue Underground, & Shreik Show.",1309219200,2,1745,4.386996904024768
933279,5,6304819927,"I watch this movie every other month. The best scene is when Auretta Gay (woman with the afro) meets a bad @$$ looking zombie on a island. The make up on that zombie looked so real that I could smell the decomposition through the television. To see the zombie in Gay's eye view from it coming out of the ground to staring down at her was one of the best scenes. When I saw that scene for the first time I had to rewind it a couple of times because it was that good. I have a collection of Fulci's movies. The Beyond is another classic and so is the House by the Cemetery. If you are a horror fan check this movie out, and any other movie by Lucio Fulci. You won't be disappointed.",1305072000,2,680,4.044444444444444
933280,2,6304819927,"After reading several reviews I was really looking forward to this movie. statements like ""AS GORY AS THE LAW ALLOWS"" and ""UNOFFICIAL SEQUEL TO DAWN OF THE DEAD"" are totally ludicris.  any of the ""SAW"" movies or ""HOSTEL"" put this movie to shame. the few scenes with any kind of gore were very amatuer at best.

It did quite well and audiences loved it, I still love this one and it's just a fun flick that is really just a zombie flick and not a real dawn of the dead sequel.  This one will end up on blu ray eventually, many great fulci flicks are headed that way but this edition is the one I still have while I wait for the blu version!.  The print looks great here and this one got good blue underground treatment. Go blue underground and lets hope they go blu with this one too.",1299628800,2,580,4.169642857142857
933283,2,6304819927,"I just watched this movie after hearing so many great things about it, but honestly I don't understand what's so great about this movie! IMO, this movie was boring, the acting didn't bug me even though it was bad, the sound was also bad on my copy, it sounded more like an old 50's or 60's movies then something from 1979, but I even tried looking past that to see the movie for what it was, but the lack of anything ever happening was the big problem. I do not understand this being compared to George Romero's Dawn of The Dead which is a true classic. I love good zombie flicks, like Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of The Dead, Return of The Living Dead and I even liked the Day of The Dead re-imagining which didn't even have anything to do with the original movie, it had a whole lot of cheese factor and bad CG Gore, but at least it was really entertaining. This movie however did not catch my attention at all.
People who praise this movie, that's your opinion, but for me, 1 star for the effort and 1 star for the shark vs zombie scene. That's it... Sorry folks, each to their own opinion though.",1295827200,,1103,4.232227488151659
933284,1,6304819927,"Apparently this movie was heralded as the ""sequel"" to the original dawn of the dead. well i can take your hopes out back and give them the gun like an unfit dog because thats what this movie did to my 10 bucks. The only reason i didn't give this 0 stars besides the fact that amazon won't let me is because there are about 3 good deaths here. for gods sakes, A ZOMBIE FIGHTS A SHARK IN THIS MOVIE. it looks like a geico commercial gone wrong. I have no idea how this got lumped in with the other classic horror movies the acting is trying so hard it hurts. i love all things cheesy, gory, and creepy but this is an insult to your intelligence and has terrible atmosphere, bad acting, and you have to wait like an hour and a half for a good scene. if you love horror movies like i do and you're looking for something fresh to add to your collection, go check out oldboy, re-animator, from beyond, suspiria, dead alive, phantasm, etc. this is hands down the worst zombie movie i've ever seen and quite possibly the worst horror movie ive ever seen next to maniac.",1294444800,4,1061,4.257425742574258
933301,5,6304819927,"A derelict boat enters New York Harbor. When the Coast Guard boards the ship, they find no crew aboard, just a mess of half-eaten food, body parts, and lots of creepy looking bugs. Just when they think they stand to make a big bonus for bringing the ship into port, a mysterious, blood soaked man appears out of a locked cabin door and attacks and kills one of the officers. The other officer has no choice but to shoot the man, who falls off the boat and into the harbour. These events bring up a lot of questions for local police and newspapers. One periodical sends out their resident British reporter to cover the story. Soon circumstances lead the reporter and the daughter of the man who owned the derelict boat on a search in the Caribbean Islands. They meet up with another couple on vacation who agree to help them search for an elusive island, where the boat's owner was practising medicine. When they finally find the island, they also find out that the dead are coming back to life on this island, as flesh eating zombies. Now they have to fight their way back to their boat, and off the cursed island.

Zombi 2 is not exactly what an average moviegoer would call a `good movie'. There are stark inaccuracies: reanimated corpses of Spanish Conquistadores still have lots of rotting flesh, despite being dead for hundreds of years. Silly situations are sold as exciting ones (a lethargic shark and zombie fight), and the dialog can be very bad (`...The skipper of that ship must be a real turkey.'), but despite of all these inherit flaws it remains a loveable movie. Like most Lucio Fulci films, and in turn most Italian horror films, it has beautiful cinematography and craftsmanship. Every shot and camera move is lovingly composed, no matter how fantastic or ridiculous the events unfolding. Every moment is played dead serious, without the wink-wink sensibilities of most modern American horror films. There is a very distinct overall feel of dread in this world where even the zombies walk with their heads down, like depressed, dirt-caked mental patients. Though it may be hard to take seriously, Zombie 2 can engross the viewer, if the viewer is willing. This is lowbrow entertainment for sure, but it's a damn sight better than most movies being made today, zombie related or not

The appeal (or lack of appeal) of Zombi 2 can be best nut shelled by its most `celebrated' sequence (spoiler warning). In one scene, zombies attack a woman while she is alone. She starts the scene showering (with a mirror behind her so both her nude front and back can appear simultaneously) while a dead, blue hand gropes at the window in front of her. Having not noticed the window groping, she dries off, gets dressed and takes a pill to calm her nerves (there are zombies about after all). A sudden sound alerts her to the impending danger and she attempts to barricade her self in her bedroom. Just when everything seems safe again, a rotting hand bursts through the door and grabs her by the hair. She is then slowly pulled into a large splinter of door eyeball first. The effect is very convincing, especially considering the budget constraints of the picture. While this is an exciting, even enticing sequence, one can't help but admit that it's more than just a little gratuitous. To move the plot along all the movie needed was for the zombies to kill and eat the wife. Killing and eating is a violent act, but it doesn't usually need to involve an erotic bathing sequence or massive ocular damage. It could be argued that the showering could be perceived as a reflection of the actresses vulnerability, but the ocular attack (common in Fulci films) really doesn't deem itself necessary. In spite of action that any first year screenwriting student would tell you were unnecessary, this is the most memorable sequence in the movie. This is the conundrum of reviewing Zombi 2 to the same standards as a more mainstream movie.

Director Lucio Fulci had been making films for decades before the release of Zombi 2, but this was the one that finally got some notice, especially outside of his native Italy. Legions of American horror fans have sense labelled him the `Godfather of Gore', and his films have been rabidly followed for years, passed around and traded through foggy, dim VHS tapes made from out of print Japanese Laser Discs. It wasn't until the DVD revolution that fans could finally start enjoying his films the way they were meant to be seen. Fulci's signature style really came into its own in the late 70's and early 80's, with movies like Don't Torture a Duckling and Four of the Apocalypse (his western). But it wasn't until after Zombi 2 that he perfected it with a string of zombie related horror films, City of the Living Dead, The Beyond and House by the Cemetery. Wide-screen views of gloomy landscapes and, of course, outrageous gore quickly became his trademarks. Later on, like most successful directors, he started to just go through the motions, but his classic material remains atop the apex of horror entertainment.

Video
Zombi 2 (under the title Zombie) had already been released twice by Anchor Bay studios, both times with the same decent looking (but rather artefact-filled) non-anamorphic transfer. For Shriek Show's release the film has been cleaned to a point of impeccable clarity, and therein lies the problem: the film looks too good. Sure there's a glimpse of dirt and grain here and there, but for the most part, Zombi 2 looks like a new movie. I've read DVD reviews before that complained of an image that was too perfect and scoffed at them. How could a film look too good? Well, here it is--a film that has been cleaned to death. The fine detail and lightened images really show certain appliances (specifically the gushing neck wounds) for what they are, just special effects. Several gore effects lose their mystique, and that really works against the appeal of the movie. The greater crime though, is that Fulci's trademark dusty, gloomy landscapes have become sort of unclean midday beach-scapes.  Several night scenes are so much lighter that they now appear as day scenes. I'm sure Fulci didn't intend his film to look quite this happy and bright. Having watched Zombi 2 on a pan and scan, dirty VHS tape, I appreciate what Shriek Show was trying to do here, but for me, the movie works better when it's dirty and dark. Personally, I'm going to hang onto my Anchor Bay DVD, but I'm pretty sure a lot of fans will be thrilled with the new transfer.

Extras
Shriek Show gained the rights to release a special edition of Zombi 2 a few years back. Later Blue Underground got their hands on a nice print of the film, so the two companies struck a deal to release separate DVDs, on the same day, one a special edition, and one a decidedly less special edition. Shriek Show saved their right to release the special edition, and that is the version I have reviewed here. The features are spread over two disks (which they really didn't need to be) and start with an audio commentary track featuring actor Ian McCullough and moderator Jay Slater. This is, in fact, the same track from the older Anchor Bay DVD, and sadly, it hasn't become any more interesting. McCullough has a few things to say, but none of it is very intriguing, and I found myself wanting to turn the 5.1 audio back on instead. Also on the first disc is a gallery of posters and production images, and little chat with the fat boat zombie entitled `Food for the Worms'. It's short at twelve minutes, but is a fun bit of nostalgia that contains a few bits of trivia that will surely be new to most fans.

Now then, the second disc is the real reason most of us will chose this edition over Blue Underground's, so what does it house? First is a quick interview with the costume designer, which is not subtitled, even though his English isn't exactly superb. I tried very hard to understand what he was saying, but I didn't get most of it. Entitled `Raising the Dead' (for some reason), there isn't any good reason as to why this wasn't inserted into the main documentary. My guess is that Shriek Show got their hands on this interview after a final edit and didn't feel it was necessary to take the time to change anything. Anyway, said main documentary is called `Building A Better Zombie', and runs longer than the film itself. Full of interviews with mostly crewmembers (none of the non-zombie cast members seem to have had anything to say), it contains plenty of stories about production, gore effects, the cast and director. It's not as polished or professional as a major studio or Anchor Bay documentary (several of the interviews seem to have been filmed in the participant's back yards), but it has a certain appeal to it, like it was made by loving fans, not a corporation. It's very interesting to compare the Italian special makeup effects to those of the American counterpart, Dawn of the Dead. Both productions found different ways to deal with budget constraints in very creative ways. This is a good documentary all around and really the only reason for forking over extra money for this version of the DVD.

Also on the second disc is the short `An Evening with Dakard', where we are treated to two songs performed by the actor who played the doctor's assistant in the film. It's cute, and I'm sure the die-hard fans will love it. The disc is rounded out with assorted zombie movie trailers. Ironically enough, there is no trailer for Zombi 2 under any of its pseudonyms (apparently those all went to Blue Underground), but I'm still a big trailer fan, so for me this was great stuff. I am particularly fond of the Zombi 3 and four trailers, which prove in seconds that none of these sequels have anything in common beyond the presence of zombies.",1293408000,2,9784,4.68760907504363

The grave yard zombie that bites Auretta Gay's throat is the perfect zombie: Worms, decay. ugly teeth. A very handsome fellow. The theme music that plays everytime before the zombies appear is spooky. I like it. Auretta Gay looks VERY NICE scuba diving. Olga Karlatos is very good looking and REALLY looks good in the shower. One of the most blackboard scratching feelings happens when a zombie kills Olga Karlatos by pulling her face through a busted up splintered door. Tisa Farrow is good looking.

I don't remember seeing a zombie movie that gory before.  Sure its outdated for todays standard of zombie movies, though I still enjoy watching it today.  I really enjoyed watching the commentaries about this film.  It' always fascinating to see on film and hear what was involved in making these movies.  Even though the movie had some drawn out scenes, as most movie do, I wasn't bored.

Allowing their viewers to see every agonizing scene of being eaten alive slowly up close was scary and on the other hand, demented.  The sounds of the creatures biting and eating flesh were eerie. The music was haunting, which I enjoyed listening to throughout the film. The scene with the zombie in the ocean fighting to eat the shark was classic.  How brave was this guy if this shark was real?  All in all, this movie is worth some popcorn, a soda, or other snacks when viewing.  Invite some friends over for some fun, even if the movie is not as great as other zombie movies out there. I enjoyed this movie, which gave me some scares, so maybe you will too.",1285977600,4,1206,4.461187214611872
933307,1,6304819927,"Fulci, and this movie, are both always hailed as greats in the zombie genre.  Well, they are friggin terrible.  Nothing in this movie is enjoyable on a legitimate level, in fact, it's almost difficult to think they made this movie on purpose.

A few points to ponder:
-The main character, I call him captain comeover, is the worst main character ever in a movie.  He does nothing important, ever.

-They hint that zombies are the result of a voodoo tribe, but then they forget about it and go do something else.

-The actual direction is terrible, scenes are hackishly shot, and there is no sense of cohesion from scene to scene.

-The death scenes are gore-filled, yes, but they take FOREVER and are ultimately pointless to the plot or lack thereof.

-Zombies walk INCREDIBLY slowly with their eyes closed most of the time, then suddenly have fits of speed and strength for no reason.

-Characters stand there, weapons in hand, and wait for the zombies to walk up to them, which takes over a minute in one case, and bite them.  I'd also like to point out most of the zombies don't eat people in this movie, they bite them once, spit, then stand there and wait to be shot in the face.

-The effects in this movie are hugely disappointing.  The main zombie, the one on most posters and dvd covers, is actually pretty terrible looking.  He's supposed to be several hundred years old, but under that gross looking face is a normal dude.  Also, several hundred year old bodies don't bleed do they.

-It literally sounds like they stole the music from an insane children's movie.

The only thing I really loved about the movie is the final scene which is basically the current DVD cover.  It was a cool image, but it was ruined by overdubbed dialogue so bad it made me cringe.

In short, I was told there was a movie where heads exploded, a chick got something rammed into her eye, a zombie fights a shark, and people were eaten alive.  These are exactly the things that are good about this movie, but it accounts for maybe seven or eight minutes of footage.  If you insist on watching it, get it as cheap as possible, I would buy it used, don't waste your money.",1285545600,10,2158,4.4987146529562985
933308,1,6304819927,"I spent some decent coin on this movie because I had heard it was a classic (I'll go ahead and say it shouldn't be). I popped it in last night hoping to experience and enjoy the unofficial sequel to Dawn of the Dead (my favorite horror and zombie movie, btw). I was so badly disappointed. And yes, I do like bad movies. This was just disappointing and a waste of time.

I was excited when the trailer said that a complimentary ""barf bag"" was included with movie tickets. But, no. One of the worst zombie movies when it comes to gore. Sure the occasional, ""Oh snap, that's a decent amount of gore"" occurs but it's still not great. Do NOT believe what you read when you see that Zombie has a gory eye splinter scene. It looks like something that my friends and I could have made (we can't film worth crap). Just picture an overly painted mannequin being stabbed in its gelatin based eye and there is the scene (and while it's happening, no blood; none at all until it shows the actress from the front). Watch Day of the Dead for the gore.

The story still left me scratching my head. I won't bother going into detail. During the movie, a radio announcer says that the zombies are basically unstoppable. WHAT?! They walk slower than Romero's zombies and are easily killed by a simple shot to the noggin!! GAH!

Similar to the gore, the make up is absolutely horrible. The zombies look like they are made with stones and plastic and are sprinkled with worms for flavor. If you want a gory zombie movie with awesome make up (Tom Savini, you are the best and will never be topped when it comes to making zombies) watch Day of the Dead; the bloodiest of the Dead movies.

I feel duped after watching this. I feel embarrassed for Romero because this is the ""sequel"" to Dawn. Save your time and money and stick to the Deads.",1280016000,3,1815,4.392857142857143

Another amazing and horrifying scene, featuring very good acting, editing and make up effects work, is set in a graveyard and depicts a freshly revived corpse, with a hideous rotted visage, slowly rising, like an erecting penis, from the soil while a young girl observes visibly transfixed with intense amazement, revulsion and horror ( which is very convincingly conveyed by her facial expression ), the viewer cutting repeatedly between the two subjects all the while.
Another very creepy and well done scene has a terrified woman urgently attempting to push a door closed, while another, yet unseen force pushes simultaniously from the other side. Then the viewer pans over to a close up of the doors gape, through which a rotted human hand, pressing against the door, is barely visible!
In this same previously related scene, the zombie, having punched it's arm through a wooden vent in the door, grabs the womans hair and pulls her by her scalp. Then a large jagged splinter ( formed by one of the busted and protruding wooden shingles ) pierces her eye ( graphic close ups of the jagged wood puncturing and slowly demolishing the soft moist orbal tissue ),then breaks loose and remains deeply embedded in the eye of the now screaming woman!  This scene is not only grisly and explicite ( which it certainly is indeed ) but, moreover, it also effectively demonstrates the zombies utter lack of pity and humanity ( they'll stop at nothing to gain their victim and sate their hunger, and will commit the cruelest enormity in the process of same ), thus making them more sinister and terrifying!
The scenes depicting the plague victims ( set in a rather crude makeshift hospital converted from an old spanish mission ) are also very creepy, grotesque and disturbing. Particularly a scene in which a heap of bloody, bound and shoud-covered corpses are collectively dumped into a large grave, to the aural accompaniment of loud, ominous, haunting and very authentic sounding native chants, wails and drumbeats.

Now, this movie gets routinely dismissed, by many reviewers, as a ""rip off"" or ""imitation"" of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead for the obvious fact that it features the same basic theme of contagious cannibalistic zombies but, none the less, this film really is a classic in it's own right. And, despite that standard old ""rip off"" allegation, it actually does have some elements which do distinguish it from Romero's zombie movies,.. like the island setting, voodoo theme, the rotted look of the zombies and much grimmer over-all tone.  I've always thought that Fulci did basically the same thing with flesh eating zombies that Hammer studios did with the old Universal monsters ( Dracula, Frankenstien, The Mummy, Werewolf, Phantom of the opera,.. etc. ) or that Sergio Leone did with the western,.. . that is he took the basic theme and gave it a completely different and unique look, ambiance and mood,.. recaste it into a whole different meilieu, so to speak. And for that he definitely deserves his fair share of admiration and acclaim.

The gore and make up effects ( by Gianetto DeRossi ) are certainly one of this films strong points.  The zombies ( in divers states of disfigurement and decay ) are very realistic and frightening looking. They are also even better portrayed than in most other films.  Though they ambulate very slowly ( as other reviewers have already noted ) they're also completely silent with no expression. They don't leer or stagger and make allot of noise ( grunt groan or go ""Ehhh!.. Ehhhh!! .. Ehhhhhhh!!"" ) like in other zombie flicks.  These zombies actually seem to sort of sneak up on their victims. Approaching them very slowly, silently and sedately ( in a seemingly mesmerized or somnambalised state ), then suddenly BITING real quickly them when they get near, which makes them more creepy and frightening to me.

The soundtrack and original musical score ( by Fabio Fizi and Giorgio Cascio ) is another of this films noteworthy qualities.  Truly eerrie, nightmarish and, at times, even sensual,.. almost like a more macabre version of Tangerine Dream. And it perfectly suits the mood and imagery of this film.  And, even despite these many alLegations, made by other posters, about ""poor writing and bad acting"", it actually does have some interesting plot elements and a few interesting characters and decent performances from some talented actors among it's cast.  In particular, Richard Johnson as the scientist character who's trying obsessively to determine a ""rational cause for the phenomenon"" ( right,.. he is NOT a mad scientist ""creating"" the zombies, as some other ""reviewers"" have erroneously stated ) while scoffingly dismissing the natives assertions about ""voodoo"" and ""demonism"", and being driven increasingly perplexed and frustrated by his own futile efforts ( ""Nothing fits!!!"" ), and his terrified and distressed wife ( played by a certain Olga Karlatos, most recognizable from the 1980's blockbuster hit Purple Rain ) who just wants to depart the ""damn island"" before the ever-amassing menace overruns the place and claims her victim,. .. which it indeed does eventually ( she's the victim of the grisly eye puncturing related previously )!

If you want a creepy, atmospheric and, oh yes, gruesome horror film ( and THOSE are qualities which I certainly value and admire in a horror flick ) then this is a flick that I would definitely recommend to you.

So here is a short review from a person who would give The Last Man on Earth, REC (Spanish Lang. version), Carnival of Souls, Night of the Living Dead, and both Dawn Of The Deads top marks.

Zombie -

The Bad:

The acting, the story, the effects, the directing, the make-up, the very very slow non-scary zombies, the editing, the awful dialogue, the terrible dubbing, camera work.

Zombie has a terrible lack of suspense and action for a walking dead movie. That is unless seeing a pretty woman slowly get a splinter in her eye (apparently Fulci has a pension for splinters in the eye) or watching a green-blue zombie fight a shark in a very silly under water scene.

Zombie does not have the stylistic approach to angles, color, editing or fluid camera that we are accustomed to in many of the overtly stylized and imaginative Italian made horrors (Argento and Bava for example) Nor does Zombie have any of the humor,loftier ideas, suspense, irony or satire found in the Romero films.

Zombie is just sloppy ""gore for fake looking gore sake"", exploitative, derivative, embarrassing, poorly made junk.

Having already experienced two other Fulci films (A Bullet for Sandoval and Don't Torture a Duckling) I was pretty sure the Fulci would not produce a polished or professional looking product with a zombie movie and I was right.

Zombie is a low budget film and therefore we can forgive allot - but the problem for me (a horror film guy) Zombie was very amateurish looking, not scary, too dull and slow moving and not what we should expect from a pretty experienced director.

The film print and transfer used for the DVD were not good which didn't help the experience but I doubt that the film ever looked very good - even at its best.

The Good -

Maybe if you are in the right frame of mind (a MST3000 frame of mind) Zombie may be just laughably inept enough to render a few good jokes made even funnier by the praise it gets.

When all is said and done I felt the worse for seeing a couple of potentially decent actors in this mess including Tisa Farrow - a pretty actress who may have some considerable talent and who I would have liked to have seen in better films.",1278201600,,2430,4.493181818181818

933360,1,6304819927,"This movie was so disapointing. It was boring beyond belief. It took 45 minutes of the movie to get to the zombies on the island. By then, I lost all interest and turned it off after fast forwarding to see if the gore was worth watching. It wasn't. When I read that there was a Zombie Shark fight, I thought that it had to be good. Boy was I wrong. It's not even good camp. To give you a sense of my taste in Zombie movies I like, Dawn of the Dead and most Romero,Shawn of the Dead,Fido,Return of the Living Dead 1 and 3,and Planet Terror, to name a few of my favorites.",1268611200,2,570,4.008771929824562
933361,5,6304819927,"Honestly I can't speak to whether or not this seller ships orders in a timely fashion, but I can speak to the quality of this DVD. This is honestly, the best edition of this movie out there on the market. Now, there is an edition of this movie that was released by Blue Underground. This edition was released by Shriek Show, and both  editions were released on the same day. The picture and sound quality of the feature are the same on both editions, and are very good. However this edition has more bonus features, and therefore is the better choice. Also it should be said that if you purchase this DVD, you should also purchase a DVD box set known as ""The Zombie Pack"". Not ""The Zombie Pack Vol. 2"", just ""The Zombie Pack"". The Zombie Pack contains the three sequels to this film. Don't worry about buying the prequel to this movie, called ""Zombi"". ""Zombi"" doesn't technically exist. Why? Because ""Zombi"" is the name given to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead when it was released in Italy.

So really, the only thing you should try to see is Dawn of the Dead: European Version which is about 10 minutes shorter than the original.",1262390400,2,1234,4.460176991150442

While its remembered for its gore and gruesome zombie makeup, its real strength is in its slow, methodical pacing and suspenseful scares. The actors do a great job, but the terrible dubbing makes the dialogue very cheesy. I'm disappointed to find that the DVD version of this movie has brightened up the print and the dark, gloomy atmosphere is lessened.

933377,4,6304819927,"As far as guilty pleasures go, if you are a horror fan, then you can't find much better than Lucio Fulci's 'Zombie 2'.  It's also doubtful that the movie has looked any better than it has in this cleaned up edition.  I watched this on a blu-ray player which automatically upconverted this regular DVD, and I was just blown away with the picture.

I don't know if there's much of a reason to go into the story - the product description covered it pretty well, and with over 300 reviews, I'm sure they cover it too.  Suffice it to say that, once again, for no reason, the dead are coming back to life, and are intent on feeding on the living.  I really can't figure out why I like these movies so much, but I do.  I'm not necessarily a fan of poor acting and gory special effects - and 'Zombie 2' has plenty of both - but there's something intriguing about the idea of a last small contingent of normal people struggling against the armies of the undead.  Imagining myself in the company of the survivors, I wonder if I'd have the right amount of luck and skill necessary to make it.  Hmmm...I wonder.

As I said, this is an excellent transfer, but it's the special features that still leave something to be desired.  First of all, on the primary disc, the commentary is taken care of by Ian McCulloch, who states more than once that he had never seen the entire film prior to that moment.  He's accompanied on the commentary by an unnamed interviewer who is obviously a huge fan of the movie.  As the interviewer tries to prod him into giving the inside scoop behind the film, it becomes apparent that McCulloch either doesn't know, or else is reticent in talking about any of his castmembers that might be taken as a disparagement.  I can respect that, and really I'm not interested in a tell-all - what I want to know about is the shark scene and the eyeball scene.  Unfortunately, McCulloch can't tell us anything about either one, though he is probably the only native English speaker directly involved in the film that could have done the commentary.

Another short feature on the primary disc is an interview with the actor Captain Haggerty, who played the zombie who sails into New York Harbor.  This was of marginal interest, as Haggerty discusses not only this film, but his entire career.

I had hoped that the supplemental disc might have the answers to the questions I had, but it only met me halfway.  There was an extensive mini-documentary profiling the cast and crew (Lucio Fulci passed away in 1996), and the effects creators for the eyeball scene discuss in depth the story behind it, along with almost all the other eye-popping effects.  But as far as the shark scene goes, that was all second unit stuff, and no one interviewed knew much about it at all.

The special features also include trailers for 'Zombie 2' and a host of other similarly themed films which I definitely appreciated, because they looked so awful I now feel confident it is not in my best interest to rent or buy them.  Additionally, there was an interview with the make up artist of the film, which was interesting but not terribly illuminating.

This two disc version may be worth it for the 'making of' documentary on the the second disc, but I have a hard time believing they couldn't fit it on one and thus kept the price down.  I would give the edge to this edition over the single disc, simply because of the anamorphic transfer, but the cost makes it a close call.  If the anamorphic transfer were not necessary, then the single disc might be the better choice, as it is substantially cheaper.  Five stars for this classic film, but only three and a half for the extras.",1240358400,2,3668,4.5212121212121215
933378,5,6304819927,"Being a Romero fan, I was skeptical when I picked up this rather seemingly bland movie in the bargain section at Hastings. When I got home I was in for a surprise. With a catchy Goblin-esque soundtrack which echoes Romero's Dawn of the Dead, Zombie starts rather slowly and builds with intensity. Beautifully shot is the harbor in New York City where a lone boat with no crew rolls in, and then the fun begins. Chock full of gory bits, especially an eyeball gag this definitely not for the squeamish, Zombie by itself is a great movie! Being one of a kind, there is an awesome shot of a zombie fighting a shark underwater that will truly blow your mind. Those looking for so-called ""fast zombies"" of the latter Dawn of the Dead Remake or 28 Days Later should avoid this film, this one is for the people who appreciate the one and only original Romero zombie, in all it's slow and flesh-eating glory. Cheers!
P.S. I still can't watch this film past the eyeball gag and it takes alot to gross me out like this movie did. But still I try, lol.",1240185600,3,1040,4.393782383419689
933379,5,6304819927,"Well, what can I say about the classic scenes that weren't said already?  Really, nothing.  But here's my 2-cents worth:  I first saw ""Zombie"" at the old Aztec 3 moviehouse in San Antonio when I was a kid.  Having already seen the original Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", I expected a cheap copy so typical of Italian cinema, but as the saying goes, ""better to be plesantly surprised than heavily dissappointed"", as this movie became one of my all-time favorites like ""Dawn of the Dead"", the main difference between the two is that I enjoyed ""Dawn of the Dead"" as I enjoy a good war movie.  ""Zombie"", on the other hand, even without the success of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"", is a great horror movie on its own.  The only downside was that the characters were pretty much stereotypes such as the cute heroine searching for her missing father played by Tisa Farrow, the red hot traveling companion Susan (remember the diving scene) played by Auretta Gay; The obsessed scientist, his alcoholic wife, the supserstious native assistant, to name a few more, and finally the biggest stereotype of all, Peter West, played by Ian McCollough, the reporter who actually does his job and researches his facts, investigates his clues, and requires proof...in short an honest reporter, such a rare breed in today's mainstream drive-by media who brought us Jayson Blair, Mary Mapes, and Dan Rather that in this day and age he can only get a job on Fox News.  But this is well balanced by good acting and believable dialouge of people thrown into their situation.  Another pleasant surprise was that I expected dubbing snce this movie was foriegn made, but Fulci used an English speaking cast, which was really a good move.

In summary, Lucio Fulci took all the elements that makes a great classic horror movie, mainly a good storyline, great choice of scenery, good acting, believeable special effects, and a creepy soundtrack, and wove them very well.  It has become a part of my Halloween whether at home or deployed just as ""Team America"" is a partof my 4th of July.  I recommend it to fans of the horror genre very highly.  No horror collection ca be complete without it.",1230422400,,2163,4.723404255319149

You can make an arguement that The Beyond is Fulci's best work but for me it's Zombie (Zombi 2) and this version by Media Blaster's is the best it's ever looked. I had the very rare Japanese laserdisc for awhile and this blows that away. While Italian horror is not for everyone, I highly recommend this to any zombie film fan. It slowly builds, the score if great and the FX are spectacular.",1228348800,,562,4.311320754716981

933382,1,6304819927,"Since this movie claims that it is Dawn of the Dead's sequel, I will make the assumption that this film needs to be compared to Dawn of the Dead.

There are many positives to Zombie when comparing to Dawn of the Dead. For example, zombies look more like the actual walking dead, rather than the face painted zombies of Dawn. Not only do the zombies look real, but also many of the graphic scenes were gruesome and horrifying. The Dr's wife demise was probably one of the most horrific scenes in movie history.

That is where the good stuff ends, unfortunately. Just because the movie has horrifying, gruesome death scenes, doesn't mean it'll become an automatic hit with zombie fans. The thing that made Dawn of the Dead so good is the fact that there was a story to bind it all together. Zombie had no such story, although a good base was in place. The story just fell apart at the end. Not only that, it got super ridiculous at the end. I thought the final stand would have been a good fight. Instead, it turned out to be that six shooters and shotguns can shoot seemingly infinite bullets, and gas filled bottles seems to come in infinite quantities as well. Just to top it all, the movie states that New York is under a huge epidemic where zombies take over the city. When they show the scene, daily life is still happening all around with cars going back and fort and I saw what appeared to be a man walking normally on the bridge that's populate by zombies. Seems more like the movie makers just ran out of cash to close the bridge, so they just recorded right in the middle of rush hour.

The only reason I gave this movie one star is because of one thing: shark versus zombie. Just when you thought the movie couldn't get anymore ridiculous, what happens? A naked person underwater running from a shark, only to be saved by a zombie who happens to attack the shark in an attempt to eat it.

After viewing the film, I immediately, read immediately, returned the movie. It was so gross and ridiculous, I laughed at myself in even thinking there was something remotely better than Romero's film.",1224460800,,2100,4.4609375

Another thing was that I don't really like zombies on an island.

The fact is fans of these films like myself enjoy the faults. The movies should be viewed almost as comedies. Low budget horror films are essentially parodies of themselves. that is why the subtle humor of films like Braindead (a spatter parody by Peter Jackson) is sometimes missed.

933428,3,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" is generally regarded as his best film, and is definitely a film of his that put him in the horror mainstream. In addition, this is sort of Fulci's tribute to ""Dawn of the Dead"", because in Italy, ""Dawn..."" was called ""Zombi"", and Zombie was then called ""Zombi 2"" to build off the success of ""Dawn..."".
Well, is Zombie a worthy tribute to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead? Here are my POSITIVES and NEGATIVES about Zombie:

POSITIVES:
- The infamous eyeball scene, which will make you SQUIRM and GASP.
- Two throat-biting scenes, which are SOAKED in blood!
- The glorious, inevitable topless skin diving, and a shower scene where said showering girl gets the lovely eyeball piercing.
- Throwing flaming Molitovs are the zombies! I know as well you know, that's just AWESOME!
- Then, there's the legendary SHARK VS. ZOMBIE SCENE. Yes, as soon as said topless skin diver escapes, the attacking zombie and a shark that's followed the diver PITCH UNDERWATER COMBAT. Biting and grabbing ensured, this epic brawl features some dazzling underwater scenery and an awesome synthesizer soundtrack.
- An ending that makes you go OH SNAP!

Now for the NEGATIVES:
- Until they reach the island, there isn't much of a plot here. Admitedly, the scenes in between all have some level of interesting, but I would've liked a little more texture in the movie.
- For a while, the pace is slow. Even with the highlights this movie has, this movie certainly doesn't move as fast as it could have.
- CHARACTERS. The characters remain pretty static. I know there are some characters that are supposed to stay the same in movies and books, but most here didn't do anything too crazy or out of character.
- THE GORE LEVEL. The back of the DVD includes praise stating, ""As gory as the law allows it..."", haha, no no NO my friend, DEAD ALIVE is as gory as the law allows. Now, ZOMBIE has some cool gore scenes, but it's not as gory another Fulci classic, ""City of the Living Dead"". But I WILL say that ZOMBIE is about as bloody as a typical Italian horror classic.

For a B-movie, ZOMBIE definitely has the meat and potatoes of a good horror movie, and it CERTAINLY beats out most of the 20 plus horror movie remakes made since 2000, but I HONESTLY felt that it was overrated. If you like B-movies and zombie movies, this one might work, but if neither of those horror sub-genres are your cup of tea, think about it a bit before you see it. Thanks for the time, and peace.",1215993600,,2504,4.572383073496659
933429,3,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci's ""Zombi"" is a pretty good movie, except for that stupid shark scene. Honestly, shark versus zombie?! And the zombie has coordinated attacks?! Ugh. The movie is about a woman who teams up with a reporter to find out what happened to her father after his boat shows up empty (with a nasty surprise inside).  They head out to Matool where the island is about to be overrun by zombies. This movie has voodoo zombies which is always an interesting option to the usual. The film has some pretty nasty (and good) horror scenes. The eye gouging scene has made this movie famous.  The movie was slow at first but it picked up during the middle. Except for that shark scene, it was pretty good. It is very gory.",1212278400,2,714,4.484615384615385

933431,4,6304819927,"Zombi 2 is the movie that launched the career of Lucio Fulci, while prior to this he made some excellent films with Don't Torture a Duckling and Seven Notes in Black (The Psychic), but he wasn't getting a lot of attention. But all that changed with Zombi 2 and the movie became a huge hit worldwide and became one of the most influential zombie movies ever to be released. When people think of Fulci they think of him as a gore director, but at one point he was by no means a gore director, while some of his movies did feature gore they were hardly gore flicks. Lucio Fulci was a filmmaker who can tell a coherent story and rely on storytelling rather than gore. In many ways, Zombi 2 ended one era and began another. After this movie Fulci's splatter era was born.

In Fulci's career he has often been compared to other filmmakers and with Zombi 2 he was said to be cashing in on the success of Dawn of the Dead. In Italy Dawn of the Dead was released as Zombi; the producers of this movie changed the title from Zombie Flesh Eaters to Zombi 2 to make it appear as a sequel, but besides having zombies these movies are nothing a like. While Dawn of the Dead is the better film, Zombi 2 by far had the better F/X, which was done by Giannetto De Rossi.

The screenplay was written by Elisa Briganti & Dardano Sacchetti; both of these writers have did some popular movies, bur Sacchetti is the most prolific of the two. If you're a fan of Italian horror you have probably seen some of his work, he's worked with everyone from Fulci, to Mario & Lamberto Bava and Dario Argento. Sacchetti is possibly my favorite horror writer, but by no means is he great. His scripts often lack logic and feature some rather moronic characters, but when all is said and done his scripts are very entertaining.

The script by Briganti & Sacchetti is probably their best work of their careers. While the characters lack depth and are rather forgettable overall, but despite that the script works well for the most part, it's not the most exciting screenplay, but it does get the job done and actually makes sense unlike some of their later movies. It mixes in old school zombie films with the newer age. In Zombi 2 the basic flesh eating zombie formula is here and all the rules of zombie movies are here as well, but it also goes back to the 30s style with a voodoo twist.

As I stated earlier Zombi 2 ends one era and begins another, but a lot of Fulci's old style is still around. Like his prior work, Zombi 2 features a great sense of brooding atmosphere and some well done suspense and tension. Fulci never gets much out of his characters, but some of the blame can be put on the script for that, but he does create some good suspense and tension. Despite the reputation of Zombi 2 there isn't a whole lot of action. It's very much spread out, but Fulci keeps the pace moving along, though in the 2nd half there are quite a few scenes that feel like fillers, but Fulci keeps the tension going and before the audience can get too bored we get to the last act with all put zombie carnage.

Gore wise Zombi 2 delivers big time; the gore F/X was done by Giannetto De Rossi and like always were excellent. De Rossi may not be talked about as much as other F/X men, but you'll be hard pressed to find someone who is better than him. His gore scenes are great, while there might be that one or two that look a little weak he was still learning his craft; the zombies for the most part look excellent and the gore scenes are overall fantastic.

The DVD I am reviewing is the 25th Anniversary Edition that was put out by Media-Blasters. Media-Blasters have often come under fire from fans for their transfers, which often look like high quality VHS and sometimes their movies are framed wrong and feature glitches. I always cut them slack since they are putting out movies long out of print and if these movies were available they were heavily cut and Media-Blasters put them out uncut.

This is the 3rd version out on DVD; Anchor Bay and Blue Underground also put Zombi 2 out. I've never seen the Anchor Bay DVD I previously owned it on VHS from Anchor Bay, which was in widescreen and uncut. But I have seen screenshots and Media-Blasters actually improves on the transfer, which is rare Anchor Bay is out-done. The DVD from Blue Underground seems to be the same quality as Media-Blasters.

If you're looking for just the movie than the Blue Underground is the way to go since it's the cheaper of the two, but if you are a collector and want the best possible edition, than the 2-disc Media-Blasters DVD is the way to go. If only all of Media-Blasters transfers were this good nobody would complain, this is by far their best DVD they have put out.",1209945600,7,4726,4.386986301369863

933433,5,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" (or Zombi 2) is an Italian zombie horror masterpiece.  Daring, horrifying, and epic in scope, Fulci's story is outstanding.

The zombies are simple, but outstanding.  The makeup and appliances look gruesome and are very scary.  These zombies shamble even slower than the Romero style zombies, yet are just as frightening.

The gore and violence against humans and zombies is cruel and atrocious.  Despite the primative gore effects, they are still cringe inducing.  I still wince to this day.  Just know that a zombie gets its head smashed wide open with a pick.  And during the climactic battle, we get an example of home protection with a shovel.  Probably the cruelest zombie takeout I've ever seen in any movie, ever.

Be prepared, the movie does drag after the initial opening shocker, but the payoff is so worth your while.

I will always be a disciple of Romero, but this one is worthy of being elevated to Romero's initial classic.  If you haven't seen this one yet, gird up your loins and check it out now if you claim to be a fan of zombie horror.  This one delivers.",1203552000,,1100,4.721052631578948

Excellent Italian horror shocker from Lucio Fulci that is considered one of his best movies and is one of the most popular films in the foreign horror category, the film stars Mia Farrow's sister Tisa Farrow as the heroine of this picture. The film has been considered an unauthorized prequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" but this was written a year before ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978, in Italy ""Dawn of the Dead"" is called ""Zombi"" so Fulci decided to cash-in on the name called ""Zombi 2"". There's genuine suspense and shocks abound especially the infamous eyeball splinter sequence which will make viewers cringe and a memorable music score in the Goblin tradition, i think this movie works well as a non-Romero prequel to both ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" showing how the zombies first came to America to start the zombie invasion.

The 2-Disc DVD from Shriek Show is perhaps even better than Anchor Bay's DVD with a handful of goodies like interviews, trailer, Poster-and-still gallery, a documentary featurette and a audio commentary by actor Ian Mcccoulch, this is a must have movie for zombie and foreign horror fans alike.

933459,4,6304819927,"As Amazon points out and the spotlight review there is no Zombie part 1, that George A. Romero's Dawn of The Dead was released in Italy with the title Zombie and Fulci's film was titled Zombie 2 to cash in on Dawn of The Dead's Success.  However according to the spotlight review Zombie 2 was written first.  So I'm thinking George A. Romero's Night of The Living Dead (1968) influenced Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 and in turn Zombi 2 playing like a prequel to Dawn of The Dead (1978) influenced Romero's Dawn.  One random thing I felt when Brian used his weapon to bash the enemies in the head after he exited the burning church reminiscent of Shaun of The Dead.  Perhaps it's where director Edgar Wright got the idea for Shaun to use a Cricket bat as his main weapon, it does prove more efficient than guns, but thats just a guess. However I think there is another major influence here.
I believe that two films that i picked up on by great director Jacques Tourneur played major and minor influences.  First the most obvious is the concept of voodoo as a speculated reason for the zombies is from I walked With a Zombie (1943) also the island location and instead of using shadows and subtly as Tourneur did Fulci uses great makeup f/x and gore to push the envelope and get his scares, both use good atmosphere.
The next film by Tourneur i would point out in a more subtle way is Night of The Demon.  In Night of the Demon we have a skeptical Dr. played by Dana Andrews who intends to debunk a curse and expose a devil cult leader in Zombi 2 we have Dr. David Menard who resiliently searches for a scientific reason for the Zombies trying to prove the idea of voodoo false.  These two characters are important in making viewers suspend there disbeliefs and make the idea of zombies more plausible as the two doctors look for educated and scientific reasons, we the viewers like the doctors begin to accept the idea as well.
What does Zombi 2 have that no other zombie film has to my knowledge, a zombie and shark fight for that reason alone I'd recommend this to horror fans.  Another positive is alot of breasts, what it does lack besides some minor plot holes is bra's.
This is a fun horrific gore filled adventure 4.5 stars, this is my first Fulci film but will not be my last.  To hardcore Fulci fans and i realize there are alot if I overlooked anything or if you have any Fulci recommendations, comments are appreciated.

933460,4,6304819927,"This is one of my favorite zombie movies. It's just fun. Whereas Dawn of the Dead [which this is supposed to be the Italian sequel to] has real characters and motivations and you feel like you're watching something put together with a greater plan in mind, here you feel like you're watching something with just the efficient delivery of thrills in mind.

The movie opens with a scene that successfully creeped me out: an abandoned boat drifts into New York Harbor. There's a zombie aboard who bites of a police officer. The boat belonged to Tisa Farrow's [Mia's sister], father. So Tisa has to go down to the Carribean to look for him, and she brings along this reporter she's hooked up with, and they hire a boat from this bearded blond sensitive 70s hunk and his girlfriend.

There's lots of mumbo-jumbo about the island being cursed and a strange illness going around the island, but finally they get near [the movie DOES take its time getting going] the island and the showstopping set pieces start. The first is a battle between shark and zombie--less exciting in reality than it sounds, though still cool, and gaining redemptive points just for the IDEA.

I also got a creepy frisson out of the moment when the freaked-out snorkeler [Auetta Gay] comes up from the deep and says ""There was a MAN down there!"" The idea of underwater zombies is ripped off in the execrable House of the Dead.

There's another notorious scene a few minutes later, after they're reached the island, and the good doctor Menard asks them to go in and check on his wife. Unfortunately the wife is already zombie chow, but first they speared her eye on a wooden shard. Obviously this is gory, and has lots of fans, but it kind of bugs me... why would a zombie want to do that? It kind of took me out of the movie. But they make up for it a few minutes later when the body is found, and the zombies are just quietly feasting on her organs as though at a relaxing picnic [with attendant slurpy sounds].

This movie also features the famous convention of standing there utterly stupefied for five minutes while a zombie slowly, slowly, slowly shuffles over to you and takes a bite out of your neck.

It all builds to an exciting climax in a burning hospital, and featured some effectively creepy shots leading up to then. It ends on a note that has become somewhat of a clich [and probably was one then], but you expect it by that time. All around, a great, gory, lighthearted and fun zombie movie.",1181520000,,2476,4.540358744394619
933461,4,6304819927,"Fulci is synonymous throughout his film making and within the horror community for his stark (and very sadistic) vision of intensely gory and horrific imagery and Zombi 2 (known as Zombie Flesh Eaters over here) is no acceptation.

I remember the first time I saw this film on Channel 4 (a gore weekend if I remember) and how much it differed from Romero's trilogy.  For starters, the zombie effects (in my opinion) are much creepier and therefore better.  The music, although slightly grating, gives the film a real ""atmosfear"" and intensifies the ominous presence of the walking dead which gave me the occasional chill down my spine to see those things slowly rising from the grave (the Conquistadores scene) and walking about so.

I bought this film under the possible hope for a better picture and sound and it has not disappointed.  This DVD DOES has improved picture and sound quality (although it's a shame it cannot improve dubbing acting, but it's still low-budget) with all the gore scenes intact and in brighter detail, I found this to be much better than the release we have over here.  Which kind-of leaves me wondering why it is only available to America and not for the rest of us Europeans, it is after all a European film.

This film is a horror cult-classic and it is good to see that such care has been put into restoring it.  The extras are OK, but nothing worth shouting about, but I did like the free poster you get with it.

933464,5,6304819927,"Okay, let's be brief: If you didn't grow up in the horror lovin' 80's or are not an established fan of Italian horror films, this movie probably won't work for you. This is the unofficial sequel to Romero's ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (the 1978 version of course) made primary for Italian audiences when Dawn was released there under the title of ""Zombi"". Even though this one doesn't take place in a mall or feature anything or anyone like the original storyline of Dawn, it does have almost the same feel. Eventually in America, this film came to us with English dubbed audio under the title of ""Zombie"". But now Shriek Show has finally released a remastered 2 disc set of this classic movie fully uncut for the first time in the states.

Or so I thought.

Ya see, when the movie starts, there's a brief scene set-up (as it always was), then it goes into the opening credits. I was expecting to see the original Italian credits showing it finally under it's original title ""Zombi 2"", like the box. But it isn't, it's the American version with the title ""Zombie"". Nitpicking, huh? But after a little searching I found an Easter Egg that shows that original title sequence that finally shows that this film was called ""Zombi 2"". Here's how to get to it (it's easy....):

On Disc One go to the ""Features"" section. In there, press the number ""6"" on your remote. It will activate a red skull button in the upper right on the screen (you CAN'T activate it by searching around the menu with your arrow buttons, very rare by Easter Egg standards!), and it will press the button automatically and take you to the original Italian opening credits and clearly show that this film was called ""Zombi 2"", logo and all. Also, after they're done, it will show an alternate end credits, but honestly I couldn't see any difference on them as opposed to the ones on the movie now.

All in all, this movie has never looked or sounded better ever. Some say it's looks too cleaned up now. They might have a point because the picture is so perfect now (colors bright, sharp image, brightness exact, sound crisp, etc) that it gives away the effects in the movie. Well, I'd rather have this movie perfect picture than a dark, grainy VHS anyday.

This movie is a classic piece of horror history and should be owned (especially the Shriek Show 25th Anniversary version...the extras here are superior....the making of documentary is as long as the movie itself!) by anyone with two or more ""Living Dead/Zombie"" DVD's already in their collection. I'm glad I got it, THIS is the way classic horror should be re-released.

P.S.: If you look hard enough (the DVD's trailer section has their previews), there is a ""Zombi 3"" and a ""Zombie 4"" movies out there too. Trust me, you don't need them or want them, as they don't have the same feel or quality of ""Zombi 2"" or ""Dawn Of The Dead"". Just be happy with their trailers.

Suddenly the film jumps to New York harbor, a month later. An abandoned yacht is sailing around by itself and the coast guard pulls aboard to keep it from ramming into anyone. Two cops investigate around on the deck, but suddenly a zombie comes out of a cabin and bites one of the cops in the jugular vein; killing him. The other cop orders the zombie to halt, but he keeps on coming towards him. The cop open fires at the zombie and it falls into the ocean. A young woman named Anne Bowels (Tisa Farrow) is questioned by the police when it is discovered that the boat belonged to her father (Ugo Bologna). She does not know anything except that her father left for a tropical island to do research. That night, Anne sneaks aboard the yacht in order to get some information about her father. She runs into a reporter named Peter West (Ian McCulloch). Peter found a letter written by her father, which states that he is on the island of Matool and that he had contracted a strange disease. The two decide to join forces to find Matool. Peter thinks that this all could make a really good story for the paper. The two fly out to the Caribbean and charter a boat owned by a seafaring couple, Brian Hull (Pier Luigi Conti) and Susan Barrett (Auretta Giannone). Meanwhile on Matool, Dr. David Menard (Richard Johnson) is hard at work trying to find the source of a deadly epidemic that is destroying the island. Menard lives on Matool with his wife Paola (Olga Karlatos), an alchoholic basket case. On the way to Matool, the boat with the two couples set anchor so Susan can photograph the fish. Susan dives into the water wearing her scuba gear (and ONLY her scuba gear.) She starts to take some great underwater shots, until she sees a hungry tiger shark coming straight at her. The shark rams the bottom of the boat and causes some damage. Just when she thinks that things can't get any worse, she finds herself face to face with a zombie (under the water no less). Susan rubs some fire coral in the zombies face so she can get away. The zombie then gets attacked by the tiger shark. The zombie takes a bite out of the shark, and then the shark bites the zombie's arm off. Susan gets back to the boat and tells the others that there was a man under the water. The damage to the boat is too bad for it to sail much further. The people decide to sail for the closest island in view, hoping that it is Matool. Fortunately it is Matool, but unfortunately they are arriving during a deadly zombie epidemic.

COMMENTS: This film is one of the goriest movies that I have ever seen; definitely not for kids. In Italy, director Lucio Fulci is known as the ""king of splatter."" They aren't kidding. If you want to get into Italian horror films, then this film is a nice gateway. Italian horror films are much more gory than American horror films. Everything that we don't show, they do show. One scene in particular shows a woman getting stabbed in the eye with a large wooden splinter, and they actually show it. American horror films would have shown up to the point where the woman was about to get stabbed and then panned the camera away. The scene with the tiger shark is another memorable scene. The shark is an authentic tiger shark and not a mechanical shark like in Jaws (1975). The actor playing the underwater zombie is the shark's trainer. The real actor got sick at the last moment, and the shark's trainer had to replace him. One thing I couldn't stand was that the characters never seemed to realize that the zombies could only be killed by destroying the brain (like in any other zombie film). You think they would have realized after killing the first zombie, but throughout the whole film they keep on shooting at the zombies on places other than their head, until they finally go down. Since this film is Italian, it has been dubbed. Half the cast spoke English and half the cast spoke Italian. Some of the Italian actors spoke English, but were dubbed anyway in order to remove their thick accents. Even the English-speaking actors were dubbed over by themselves, and in some scenes they didn't do a very god job. This film is actually an unofficial sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead (1978). Fulci started filming in 1978, but halfway through the production Dawn Of The Dead was theatrically released in Italy under the title Zombi. The producers, wanting to cash in on Dawn's success, quickly made changes to the script and new scenes were later filmed in New York City as a way to tie in the story line with Romero's film. The film was released in Italy as Zombi 2. It is only known as Zombie in the U.S. It is known in the U.K. as Zombie Flesh Eaters, and in various other countries with titles like Island Of The Living Dead, Island Of The Flesh-Eaters, and Woodoo. In actuality, Zombie plays out better as a prequel to Dawn because it shows the origin of a zombie plague. Dawn takes place during an already raging zombie plague. This is because Dawn is the sequel to Romero's Night Of The Living Dead (1968), but I guess the Italians didn't know that. The true sequel to Dawn Of The Dead is Day Of The Dead (1985). Zombie ultimately became a cult classic among zombie and horror fans. Tom Savini, EFX wizard for Dawn, later admitted that he thought he had done a great job with the gore in Dawn, until he saw Zombie and realized that he had been outdone. Lucio Fulci later became one of the most famous horror directors in Italy. He made an unofficial Gates Of Hell trilogy which consisted of the film's City Of The Living Dead (a.k.a. The Gates Of Hell) (1980), The Beyond (a.k.a. Seven Doors Of Death) (1981), and The House By The Cemetery (1981). Zombie (a.k.a. Zombi 2) later spawned some sequels of it's own. Fulci began to film Zombi 3 (which was actually the second Zombie film), but later pulled out due to health problems. Director Bruno Mattei finished the film and it was released in 1988. Zombi 3 had nothing to do with Zombi 2; it was a completely new story about zombies. Zombi 4: After Death was also released in 1988, and it too had nothing to do with Fulci's original film. This particular DVD version has been released under the original Italian title: Zombi 2. This is the 2-Disc 25th Anniversary Special Edition, and it rocks! It is presented in the original theatrical widescreen ratio and can be viewed dubbed in English or Italian. It also features a ton of other goodies including commentary by Ian McCullogh, an extensive photogallery, the original theatrical trailer, Making-Of featurettes, cast and crew interviews, and a collection of trailers for other zombie films.",1168214400,5,6760,4.527391659852821

The boat belongs to a man whose daughter is concerned about him.  She and a reporter hire a boat to find her father.  Their destination is an island said to be cursed.  The boat they hire is run by a young couple.  Along the way the couple do some diving (she is topless).  She is scared when she sees a man under the water who attacks a shark and tries to eat it.  She is very upset and somehow loses the rest of her suit when removing her tanks.  The Continue to the island which is just a short distance away.

Once on the island they discover researchers looking into a phenomena where the dead rise to attack the living.  Legend says it is the work of voodoo but the lead scientist is convinced there is a medical explanation.  Unfortunately the missing father has already died but at least now it is known.  But soon the zombie trouble gets out of control as cemeteries give up hordes of the walking dead.  In the end, only a few manage to escape the island to head back to civilization.  They keep one zombie as proof that they are not crazy.

This is one of the better zombie films although the final battle is a little odd as zombies seem to appear out of nowhere inside buildings.  That aside the story builds nicely with the multiple plots weaving together smoothly.  There is plenty of nudity in this one and plenty of gore, although somewhat tame by today's standards.  The acting is reasonable for the effort and special effects are decent.  I enjoyed the ending which I gather was supposed to be a shocker but which I predicted from the beginning.  My guess is that most viewers will get too caught up in the rest of the movie to think that far ahead, or so the producers hoped.  If you like zombie films you will have to check this one out.",1165190400,3,1914,4.284916201117318

933502,4,6304819927,"Fulci's Zombie story is not what I watched this for, considering the dubbed voices, clunky plot and slow pace. It's the zombies I paid to see, and this film really delivers them near the end of the film. Prior to that, they can be seen in the water and jungle. The ones in the jungle crawl from under the dirt to attack the living. The one zombie worth noting has plenty of maggots crawling out of it's decayed face, and is a perfect example of Fulci's dedication to gore and love for zombies; it's a classic zombie, slow and hungry. But that's the only thing I wanted to see more of, as there is plenty of down time where the rabid zombie fan must watch the survivors talk, but the script isn't all that interesting (IMO). If you're a zombie fan, this is really a must-see on your list. Must-buy for collectors, but for casual zombie fans, Romero's zombie films are much stronger in story, characters and zombie count. Zombie has a low zombie count for most of the film, and don't be fooled by the cover showing a bridge and city of zombies; these zombies are exclusive to the jungle, water and a boat. Decent zombie film with classic Fulci gore.",1157328000,2,1147,4.415094339622642

Are you new to this film? Then be warned: You won't be scared. The gross-outs are corny. The whole film is corny. The zombies look somewhat good, but the acting and directing are absolutely atrocious.

Other silliness:

-400 year old Spanish Conquistadors rise from the grave (decomposition non-existent I guess).
-Zombie fights shark (it's not even a fight; it's more like a goofy guy in a mask at Sea World).
-Women can get naked but can't defend themselves: 1) Zombie punches through door, grabs woman by hair and (very) slowly pulls woman towards sharp splinter. Woman does nothing; takes splinter to the eyeball. 2) New scene: a woman watches zombie approach, doesn't run, doesn't even raise hands in defense, allows zombie direct path to neck for a large, bloody bite.
-Goofy actors use Molotov cocktails...indoors. But in this movie where there's fire, there's no smoke!

Oh, it goes on and on.

It's implied that the zombies are either voodoo, experimentation gone wrong or just phenomenon, but there's never any real explanation for the zombies. Not that I needed an explanation, but it's just another of a plethora of flaws, incontinuity or plain old silliness in this movie.

933504,4,6304819927,"Fulci's most famous movie, ""Zombie"" is really a mixed bag: sometimes wild and wonderful; but in some respects, ridiculous.  Thus the storyline, which concerns murderous Caribbean zombies making their way to The Big Apple, seems the brainchild of psychiatic outpatients.  The acting abilities of the principal players would make even the most credulous audience cringe.  Even the film's musical score staggers belief: a comb w/tissue paper would produce better harmonies.  Nevertheless, this movie does have inspired, unparalleled moments.  For example, there is a pivotal scene involving a nearly naked scuba diving girl, an aquatic zombie, and a hungry shark: such are the three Key Ingredients of Truly Unforgettable Cinema!  ""Zombie"" also boasts an abundance of eye-gougings, throat-slashings, skull-splittings and cannibalism--which successfully exploit all the Grand Possibilities of Cinematic Art!  Finally there is the climactic scene of ragged zombies shambling across the Brooklyn Bridge--like an army of those indestructible creatures known as ""illegal aliens.""  That episode was powerful enough to be accorded the flattery of imitation by legendary director Jean Rollin in his ""Night of the Hunted,"" starring Brigitte Lahaie... In brief, as a prime example of very gory but influential exploitation cinema, Fulci's ""Zombie"" has few equals.",1155513600,,1350,5.817258883248731
933505,5,6304819927,"1979 saw the release of a film titled Zombi 2. It was suppose to be an unofficial sequel to Romero's own Dawn of the Dead which was released in Italy under the title of Zombi. many thought this pseudo-sequel was a way to cash-in on the success of Romero's film in Italy. This wasn't true for the fact that it's director and producers had already been working on their own zombie film as Romero started on Dawn of the Dead. It was by coincidence that both were released within the same year and in order to try and tie the two films together their titles reflected it.

Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 (or just plain Zombie in the US) has no connection whatsoever with Romero's own Dawn of the Dead except for the zombies and the rules governing their destruction. This is not to say that Fulci's Zombi 2 wasn't good. In fact, I would say that Zombi 2 was, and still a great horror movie that's been unfairly compared with Romero's ultimate zombie classic. The two films tell different type of stories even when sharing similar plot devices and rules. Where Romero used the backdrop of the zombie epidemic as a damning visual commentary on the growing consumerism culture in the United States, Fulci's film eschews any such social observations and goes for pure horror instead.

Zombi 2 helped begin the Italian cinemas' love of zombie movies and Fulci's film still stands as the best of the lot. Starring Tisa Farrow as Ann, the daughter of a missing doctor working in the Carribean, and Ian McCulloch as reporter Peter West who helps Ann try to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance in one of the Carribean Islands. The only clue they have being the mysterious reappearance of a boat belong to Ann's father. A drifting yacht which, when inspected by NY Harbor Patrol, a disfigured, obese man violently attacks one of the patrolmen before falling overboard into the city harbor. From that moment on, Ann and Peter head off to her father's last location on the Carribean island of Matool. Once on Matool, Ann and Peter discover that one of her fther's colleagues, a Dr. Manard, has been trying to solve the mysterious disease, or curse as the native islanders call it, which her father became afflicted with. A disease which seem to kill those it infects and then return them to life to attack the living.

These trio are soon joined by a vacationing couple who seem to have arrived on Matool at the worst time. Ann and Peter soon enlist the aid of Brian and Susan, but before they could solve the island's deadly mystery the island's dead, both past and recent, rise up from their resting place and doom the remaining inhabitants. One sequence involving these zombies has gone down in horror history as one of the most cringe-inducing scenes on film. It involves the torturously slow sequence where a woman's head is dragged forward toward a door splinter with the splinter aimed directly at the woman's eye. This gore-sequence in addition to the scenes of the zombies attacking and feeding on the visiting Westerners and the remaining living islanders were very well done and all due to make-up FX master Giannetto de Rossi. There's even a spectacular sequence where a zombie tries to attack and feed on a live shark. Even to this day I still marvel at whichever stuntman volunteered for that action shot.

Zombi 2 has been called a dumbed down attempt to capitalize on Dawn of the Dead. I wholeheartedly disagree with this obeservation. Zombi 2 was never meant to be socially relevant, but one whose only goal was the scare, disgust and disturb its audience with scenes of extreme violence and gore. In this respect, Fulci succeeded with the final cut of Zombi 2. The acting itself was very well done considering that half the cast spoke in English as their natural language while the other half were saying their lines in Italian. The dubbing of the Italian-spoken lines were done particularly well. A rarity when it comes to dubbed films.

The final few minutes of Zombi 2 where the Matool survivors make it back to New York through its harbor makes for a great ending. With a city radio station recounting the growing zombie crisis which seemed to have begun while Ann and Peter were on Matool, the final shot of zombies walking on the pedestrian level of the Brooklyn Bridge with cars below them seeming to be rushing out of the city to escape the crisis still makes for a haunting scene. Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 might not have been the iconic, cultural and societal masterpiece that was Romero's Dawn of the Dead, but it more than holds its own when seen as a pure horror film.",1155254400,3,4582,4.665841584158416
933526,4,6304819927,"I'm a huge zombie movie freak, so it's hard to believe that it took me 27 years to see this one.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by how effective it was.  Yes, there are some aspects of the movie that are gimmicky and just don't work and the score is a hodgepodge of musical ideas that never gel and do more to detract than enhance the experience.  Tisa Farrow spent the entire film looking like a deer caught in the headlights.  I know her character's supposed to be despondent but she just looks spooked more often than not.  But for the most part, the acting is more than decent and the script cogent and concise, a few exceptions notwithstanding.  The make up, art direction, cinematography and the set pieces were very good and some of Fulci's ideas were downright inspired.  Yes, the shark scene is clever (and I'm sure very difficult to film considering they used a real shark and stuntman, which could've gone very wrong) but a bit too clever, if you get my drift.  The rising of the conquistador zombies was very cool and they were, without question, the most terrifying of the bunch, with maggots and worms writhing inside decrepit eye sockets and fossilized, jagged teeth, and the whole neat package covered in caked, gray soil.  Way cool.  The splinter scene well, if you're a lover of gore then it's worth renting it just for that.  It's not perfect mind you (but then again this is way before the advent of computer graphics that made anything possible) but it sure will make you cringe, as will the scene where the visitors walk into the doctor's house in search of his wife and find several zombies chomping away at her corpse.  The scene where the camera faces down the long road leading up to the village with a lone crab scurrying across while in the far distance we see something indiscernible slowly shuffling down, was an inspired touch, serving as an omen of things to come and it's done so with great economy but much impact.  One notable mistake had to do with the final scene and the zombies breaking into the hospital.  Kerosene bomb after kerosene bomb were tossed at the invading hordes and two things happened; 1). With every kerosene bomb that was tossed, it seemed like the same frame was used over and over, giving the impression that the zombies were stumbling in, back out, and then back in.  In other words, forward, rewind, forward, they never seemed to make it more a few feet across the threshold 2). the hospital was made of wood and palm fronds, which means that one kerosene bomb would have made the place go up like a tinderbox but it took about 10 minutes and countless bombs before the fire begins to consume the structure.  Too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.  The ending was effective, with the camera slowly pulling back from the door holding the remaining zombie at bay, as it grunts and pounds to get out while at the same time we see masses of the walking dead, crossing the bridge into Manhattan and in the background we hear a news announcer broadcasting the grim news of what's happening and then quickly give into panic and terror when the zombies break into the news studio.  The good moments work well and the one's that don't aren't so egregious as to ruin the whole experience.  If you're a horror fan in general and zombie fan in particular, there is much to enjoy in this Euro horror classic.",1151625600,2,3372,4.562189054726368
933527,4,6304819927,"Without George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, Italian director Lucio Fulci would probably not have embarked on a career of visceral and gory films throughout the 1980's. The debt owed to Romero's film is fairly obvious. But criticisms of copying should rest at the producers and distributors feet, who in best Italian fashion could smell a profit. If placed in a vacuum ZOMBI 2 is not only Fulci's best horror movie, but also better than the superficial politicising social commentary of Romero's film. ZOMBI 2 is wonderful because it positively wallows in its violence, and has no artistic claims at all which is somewhat refreshing. Fulci at this point was a director for hire, a dabbler in all genres, before he found his forte in horror and began to explore certain themes. As a result ZOMBI 2 has a pioneering quality about it and also a respect for the traditions of the Zombie severely lacking in Romero's trilogy. Romero simply uses the Zombie as a one dimensional cipher for the purpose of metaphor and allegory.  Fulci returns to the roots of the sub-genre and explores the idea of voodoo. The Zombie and voodoo come hand in hand and Fulci is not afraid to fashion a modern tale using voodoo which at this point had become unpopular in zombie films. But ZOMBI 2 is not entirely devoid of social commentary and Fulci explores the ever lasting battle between science and superstition, myth and religion and how interchangeable they are. DAWN OF THE DEAD'S trump card might be the make up effects of Tom Savini, but I have always felt the Zombie's to be unconvincing, in ZOMBI 2 they literally are walking cadavers, replete with maggot ridden eye sockets. Naturally for an Italian film, it suffers from bad dubbing, but the creepy electronic soundtrack, disorientating hand held camera work and truly gory set pieces  make up for this. As a pure expression of the horror genre, Italian cinema reached its pinnacle in this film.",1151020800,3,1933,4.801801801801802

Fulci's zombies look like realistic decaying bodies, which adds to the dread atmosphere.  Of course, the film isn't going to win any awards, but this film has many good things about it.  It actually is paced very well (especially compared to other Fulci works, which are incoherent beyond belief), it has a great synthesizer score, excellent photography, a genuine sense of dread, a few decent lines of dialogue, and some of Fulci's most intense gore (the famous/infamous eye splinter shot).  And one mustn't forget the most outrageous zombie fight ever, zombie vs. shark.  It's downright surreal to see, and it actually adds to the film a bit.

If you like this type of film, I would say it is one of the better ones I've seen.  From what I've seen it seems most people view it as one of the best zombie films also.

The highlight for most people is a zombie pushing a woman's eye into a splinter and showing the entry, though I found it rather boring and uninteresting.  When the actual woman's actual eye nears the splinter, she is very still and careful for obvious reasons and to me it ruins the effect.

The highlight for me was an early scene where a woman goes under water.  Under the water there is not only a shark, but zombies are even there underwater in the ocean!  One zombie attacks and bites the shark scaring the shark off!  If they had more scenes of this humor, it would have overcome my lack of interest in this genre, but unfortunately this was an isolated incident.

Even with films I don't like, I usually enjoy 'making of' features and this one has a very interesting 90 minute featurette regarding how they made the effects, the story of how the movie came about and was written, various anecdotes,etc.

933534,2,6304819927,"I decided to throw a Horror Movie Festival over spring break this year.  This was one of the 8 movies we watched.  None of us had seen it.  I had heard raving reviews about it.  I heard about the Eye Splinter and the zombie vs. shark scene.  I love zombie movies so as you can expect I was looking forward to this movie.  So what the hell happened?

This was definitely the worst movie out of all 8 movies that we watched.  The main reason for this is that its pace was horribly slow.  We just got bored.  VERY bored.  Its pace in the beginning was ridiculously dull, by the time things caught up we hardly cared anymore.  We ended up fast forwarding until we got to the good parts to see if there was anything that could salvage it.  There were two scenes that were awesome.  The eye splinter (which is probably one of the grossest things I've seen on film and was highly effective and awesome, as all Fulci eye scenes) and the zombie vs. shark which was just hilarious (mostly because there was also a topless Italian chick that they were fighting over) it was just so ridiculous (but well shot).

Other than the pace of the film there was a variety of things wrong with this film and I won't question its ability to make sense because I fast forwarded it.  The biggest complaint is that every single zombie has their eyes closed.  This implies either one of two things.  These zombies are blind and have a good sense of smell or they possess echolocation.  Either way its against the zombie rules: what they see they eat.  wWhen the zombies finally break though and the heroes begin to throw Molotov cocktails, the camera cuts back and forth between the time they throw it and the time it hits the ground near the zombies.  It looks like it's the same Molotov cocktail hitting the ground about three times.  They are also throwing them indoors.  That's smart... *sarcasm*.  The next flaw is that majority of the characters were just stupid and sometimes seemed to just let the zombie bite them because they couldn't believe that their friend had just turned into a zombie.  The acting was pretty bad for the most part.  Did anyone else notice that the doctor looks a lot like Saddam Hussein?  They look like they movie inches at a time!  As for the makeup with the zombies, they were pretty good but I've seen better.  Had I seen it when it was first released I probably would have said otherwise.  Last complaint, if you thought Romero's zombies were slow moving, wait till you see this movie.

Last but not least there is the clever marketing scheme the Italians pulled off.  To make this film seem like a sequel to Romero's Dead series (any one of which holds your attention better than this) is a complete crime.  It doesn't hold a candle to any of them.  Not even close.  Except the eye splinter scene (though if it were me I would have ripped the splinter off and stabbed the zombie in the face, but that's just me).  The whole story on why there is no real zombi(e) 2 is amusing to tell people though.

Anyways, apparently there are a lot of people who really enjoy this film.  That's ok. If you enjoy this film then go ahead.  It's just that it didn't spark anything for my friends and myself.  I just find this movie and Fulci's The City of the Living Dead/The Gates of Hell to be rather overrated.  Fortunately Zombi 2 is better than the Gates of Hell by far (except another legendary gore scene in that one).  In the end it's all good, because we all enjoy Zombie movies whether you like this particular movie or not :)

Zombie movies that I recommend instead of Zombi 2 would have to be Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Night of the living Dead (1980), Land of the Dead, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn, Army of Darkness, The Dead Next Door (the low budget B-movie feel of that movie is what saves it), Shaun of the Dead (an excellent comedy), and last but not least Dead Alive which has to be my favorite zombie movie of all time!  There are also many more out there that are worth your time.  You just have to hunt for them.  Hoped this helped.",1144713600,3,4098,4.361111111111111
933535,3,6304819927,"You know early on that the production qualities of Zombi 2 are pretty good. Somebody spent a chunk of time and money to give this film a polish that most zombie movies lack. I picked this movie up (along with a bunch of other zombie flicks) in an attempt to get to know the genre better, as well as to help my son prepare for his own attempt at making a zombie movie. (Legend has it that Stanley Kubrick watched every genre flick he could find prior to making 2001 -- not sure if it was all science fiction movies, or just ones about outer space. Sounded like a good idea to apply here ...)

So, production values aside, is this a movie worth seeing? I think so. As in any zombie film, the question of origins takes center stage. What, exactly, is bringing the dead back to life with a hunger for human flesh? (Someday, we might have someone with the cinematic courage to make a zombie film without cannibalism. Maybe they'll just stink up the place and get in the way. Granted, that isn't quite as terrifying as having someone stalk you down and munch on your guts.) Here, the zombies are apparently created by a voodoo shaman bent on revenge against the White Man (who invaded the island and oppressed its inhabitants, I believe). And, like virtually every other zombie movie, only a shot to the head (by gun, shovel, or otherwise) seems to stop them. In one neat twist, even the ancient dead come back to life, including conquistadors buried on the island. There's even a zombie in a place where you wouldn't (but probably should) expect one ... let's just say it's where no other zombies have gone before.

The ending is satisfying -- although telegraphed too early and not sprung upon the audience as it might have been. I think that has more to do with the film's era than anything else. I won't give the ending away here -- particularly since I thought I was being clever when I turned to my son halfway through and said, ""Wouldn't it be cool if _______ happened?"" Turns out the filmmakers were just as ""clever"" (or juvenile) as me.",1144022400,2,2039,4.463806970509383

Zombie 2 (2-Disc edition) from Shriek Show this edition is anamorphic widescreen, lots of extras, but seems to have a defect as Robert W. Gomez reviews, and finally you have the third edition from Zombie: the Blue Underground edition, this one is remastered, widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1, includes trailers & spots poster gallery & Lucio Fulci's Bio, Dolby Digital 5.1 English & Italian, English Subtitles, The Blue Underground Edition doesn't have many extras but the quality of picture is quite good (considering the movie is more than 20 years old) and the sound quality is also good, and it doesn't have any defects, that's why I believe the Blue Undergound edition of Zombie is the best choice",1141948800,2,1174,4.929292929292929

933581,4,6304819927,"If you are  a fan of the whole Zombie movie genre, you should not miss this one!.  I remember seeing the original VHS copy of this film as a young child at the rental store.  The cover had the close up picture of that rotting, worm eyed zombie and I was too afraid to rent it at nine years old. (I don't think my mother would have let me rent it either!).
It would be redundant for me to summarize the plot so I will just mention some of the scenes that stand out.
  The infamous ""Shark-Zombie"" scene was less dramatic than I had expected but was still quite innovative for a zombie flick.
The best part of that scene is when the eerie music begins and the hand grabs for the divers shoulder. Just imagine seeing that thing while scuba-diving! Very spooky!  The second best scene is when the old spanish conquest zombie's rise from the earth (including old worm-face)
  Zombie is a fun movie to watch, and it will certainly get more than one viewing if you own it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it did have some boring moments. I also think that they should have expanded further with the New York undead epidemic and added some more material.

933582,5,6304819927,"In many countries, Zombie is tilted Zombi 2 because it was the unofficial sequel to Dawn Of The Dead, which is titled Zombie: Dawn Of The Dead in many countries. Anyway, Lucio Fulci brings us one of the best horror and zombie films of all time. And with famous death scenes.

Zombie is about a reportor {McCulloch} who helps a young woman {Farrow} to find out what happen to her father, after his boat arrived in Manhattan and he wasn't in it. When they found out that he was on a deadly island with a strange disease, they decide to investigate. To get there, they need a boat ride. They find a couple {Cliver and Gay} going on vacation. But, they decide to help them out.

When they get there, the meet up with Dr. Menard {Johnson} and tells them about what happened to Ann's father. Also, they soon that the curse on this island is that the dead are coming to life and eating the living.

This film may not have the best dialogue or acting. But, it has a great zombie vs. shark scene, ultra gory kills, great makeup effects and one of the best film scores in film history.

Fulci's directing is one of the best I've ever seen. From the gory close-ups to the errie ways the dead walk. If you're a big fan of The Beyond, Zombi 2 is just perfect for you.",1132358400,,1254,4.256302521008403
933613,4,6304819927,"ZOMBIE (aka ZOMBI 2) is one of the best Italian-style Zombie movies, but not quite as strong as Romero's 'DEAD' films. Nonetheless, this 25th anniversary edition DVD is worth it. It's absolutely packed with extras and loaded with footage and goodies you won't get on the single-disc version.

ZOMBIE is a feast of unflinching gore (some of the attacks are just downright brutal), but it also features one hot and sexy almost near-naked woman diving in a g-string (is that for real in those places? she had a great behind). The movie takes place in the Caribbean and apparently, some zombies are coming back to life looking for warm human flesh. One nice surprise was that, despite the slow beginning, the pacing does pick up nicely as the zombie killings start piling up. The zombies themselves are disgusting, and some of them have maggots crawling in many parts of their rotting bodies...they were just downright creepy to look at...would you want to look at one? The ending of the movie reminds me of the ending of Dawn of the Dead, all the zombies heading toward the big city and in droves. Fulci does have a knack for good suspense, but the best scene ever shot in a horror movie has to be the poor woman who loses an eye when a zombie puts it right through a sharp shard of wood (and the insane part is that you see all of it). It's one of the best scenes ever, and you will cringe and put your hands on your eyes when you see it. And the other scene, which would be some horror geeks biggest fantasy, is a zombie fighting a shark. This zombie goes in the water and sees a shark. The shark decides to take a meaty bite out of the zombie, but then the zombie takes a bite right out of the shark. Is there anything better?

ZOMBIE is one insane trip, and Fulci did work some magic into this splendid but flawed movie. It's still a solid horror film and a necessary edition to your horror movie collection. If you like ZOMBIE, check out THE BEYOND and/or CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD.",1129766400,2,1982,4.412568306010929
933614,4,6304819927,"While I have not yet had the honor of watching the 25th Anniversary 2-Disc release, I can still say this was easily one of the very best zombie movies I have ever seen. Lucio Fulci did not possess the higher budget or company of actors that most other movies today can boast, but he still managed to crank out a brutal movie that does more than just deliver.

The mayhem begins with a seemingly empty charter boat adrift in New York Harbor. A police unit sent in to investigate soon discovers the exact opposite, as one of them falls prey to a vicious attack from a zombie hidden onboard. Tisa Farrow, Mia's sister, plays the young woman who recognizes the boat as her missing father's. He leaves behind a handwritten letter that pairs her together with a reporter from the local paper. Using what few clues the note contains, they set out on a mission to find him. Their trek couples them with yet another two people who are prepping for a vacation and, through that arrangement, they are soon led to a remote island. An island that just so happens to be overtaken by the living dead!

Forget everything you know about the zombies you have seen in the George Romero trilogy. The dead that rise in this film are far and away the most effective and unsettling visions your eyes will ever behold. No cartoony caricatures here. Gianetto DeRossi's incredible make-up almost makes you believe you're watching real corpses shamble around on the screen. I cannot honestly remember the last time I was so eerily entranced. And the gore!!! When this hit theaters in 1980, it was given the notorious ""X"" rating. Not for any nudity or explicit sex, mind you, because there is actually very little of that. This film was branded for its unprecedented gore quotient. From throat tearings to eye gougings, every brutality you can possibly imagine is fully realized in unapologetic detail. The only American movie made since that I can say comes anywhere close to what this movie offers was Zach Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead.""

It won't win any awards for acting, to be sure. But I don't really believe Fulci was all that concerned with getting the Oscar. He was a director that very literally went for the jugular with his films, and ""Zombie"" was certainly no exception. His unwavering eye, his pull-no-punches attitude, and his raw knack for giving the gorehounds what they want is in full form here. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it does succeed in putting every other ""dead"" film that came out around that time to complete and total shame.

933620,4,6304819927,"For anyone looking at Fulci's epic on Amazon or anyone reading mine or the other reviews, buy this DVD.  A story synopsis is really unnecessary here.  I know plenty of people will say that ""The Beyond"" is Lucio Fulci's best (I admit it's his most polished), but my personal fave from Fulci is ""Zombi 2"".  Here is a movie where calling the undead a zombie is totally appropriate.  Don't get me wrong, I love Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy (haven't seen the fourth one yet), but there's something really creepy, disturbing and unsettling about the correctly labeled zombies here.  They are simply the most disgusting, bloated, slobbering, decaying, worm covered bogosities around.  The zombies here move in an unique way, as if they were really re-animated stiffs.  Plus, there's all that moaning going on.

  The similarity between the basic premise between Fulci's & Romero's Zombie films are apparent, but ""Zombi 2"" was written before ""Dawn of the Dead"" as ""Zombie"".  You learn that and much more during the special features with interviews and an incredible 98 minute documentary including interviews with the Italian version of Rob Bottin, Gianetto De Rossi (who did the special make-up FX here as well as many other Italian splatter features).  Interesting note, I thought Gianetto De Rossi & Gino Di Rossi were the same person, guess what, they're not!  Similar names, same profession, go figure!

  This DVD is a must have for anyone who is a horror fan, especially fans of this particular sub-genre.  Great features, the picture and sound are really incredible.  The only negative thing I can say, and it's minor, is the commentary by Ian McCullough.  I have nothing against the guy but his commentary is somewhat lame, he openly admits that his first time watching the movie from start to finish was right there at the commentary session!

 PLOT: The plot is done well, a voodoo curse brings the dead back to life on an island, eventually spreads to the city.
 ZOMBIES/GORE: The zombies and gore in this movie are the best of the best. The zombies look great, the best ive seen. Very well done. The gore is also very good with scenes like the classic eye splinter scene.
 FILMWORK/DVD: The filming is good and helps make the movie scary. Anchor bay did a good job puting the DVD package together, but could of used some more extras. The quality is good.

What makes this film work (from a horror buff's perspective)? The haunting score at the begginging is something that'll definately stick in your mind. It's totally creepy organ music that could be best described as ""haunting"".

The gore is really the most talked about part of the film. And in all honesty, if the gore was cut out completely this wouldn't be a movie worth anybody's time. However, it's a zombie film and it delivers the goods. When i say it's gory, i mean it's eye gouging, head splitting, flesh tearing, intestine munching, decapitatingly gory. Good stuff for the gore hounds out there (myself included).

This zombie film works simply because it really does have quite a few memorable moments in it. An underwater filmed battle between a man in zombie makeup and a real live shark takes the cake aside from the ""eye piercing"" scene that is infamous.

I could keep going on and on, but i won't. I'd say pick this sucker up if you're not just a casual horror fan (a fan of films such as ""urban legend"" or ""i know what you did last summer""), but  hardcore horror fan (one who appreciates older italian shock cinema perhaps...lol).

A shocking and excellent Italian horror thriller from Lucio Fulci whom was fresh off of doing comedies, westerns and thrillers gives us one of the most repulsive and scariest cult classics of all time. There is a creepy tropical atmosphere to give the movie's feel a tender eerieness with it's groovy music score by Fabio Frizzi and graphic gore effects such as the memorable if absolutely horrifying scene involving a woman getting her eyeball stabbed through a large splinter of wood.

The 2-Disc anniversary edition is certainly an improvement over the Anchor Bay version with better picture and digital sound quality that also contains the original Italian language track with English subtitles. It's extras are terrific, it's got featurettes on the history and behind the scenes of how this movie got made with it's success around the world, it's original european theatrical trailer, other trailers to zombie movies avalible from Media Blasters DVD, interviews with the actors & filmmakers and a photo, poster-and-still gallery.

There, they discover a horrifying plague of zombies overtaking the residents, and a mysterious Dr. Menard desperately trying to understand the strange phenomenon. Naturally, this being a zombie film, everything goes to Hell as the dead overwhelm the living, devouring anyone in their path. It's anyone's guess who will survive the carnage!

Italian Horror legend Lucio Fulci's much loved 1980 classic, ""Zombie,"" is not the most brilliant film ever written. It's not the most brilliant horror film ever written. It's not even the most brilliant zombie film ever written. I'm not even sure it would make the top ten. What I am sure about though, is that it's 91 minutes of zombie horror that should more than satiate the typical video gorehound's appetite. It's a perfect example of a gory zombie movie made simply for the sake of making a gory zombie movie. But is it worth watching for those of us who are more interested in disturbing concepts than disturbing violence? In this reviewer's opinion, the end justifies the means, literally. It's the last few moments of the film that make me happy to have it in my collection, and that take it up a notch from two stars to three. Though the fabulous ending still doesn't quite put ""Zombie"" on par with the Romero classics, or even some of the recent zombie revival films, there are plenty of other moments to make the film a keeper, or at least worth a good, hard viewing. The two most classic and talked about moments, of course, are the shark vs. zombie battle and the splinter through the eyeball scene, both well worthy of their fame. The film also sets a nice, ominous mood, despite the warm, tropical locale. Not as frightening as seeing such events take place in our own, suburban backyards, but if one can get lost in the movie enough to feel the isolation of the island itself, it's more than an adequately frightening setting. In addition to the eye-popping gore-fest that is ""Zombie (AKA Zombie 2 and Island of the Flesh Eaters),""  the DVD provides us with a somewhat interesting commentary track, a trailer, and a nice set of TV and radio spots.

I must admit im not the greatest fan in the world but i do rate The House By the Cemetery - as it was a true storybook nightmare that oozed a tale similar to the anything that the Brother Grimm came up with and for Fulci, actually made a bit of sense.

Anyho, this is a review for Zombie and it is the only other film of his that i actually came close to liking (Sorry - but i hated The Beyond and City of the Living Dead is badly acted and out-dated in a big way).

I do love italian horror and liked Dario Argento back in 1985 when he wasn't commerically know (actually don't think he still is)

The first thing i noticed with this film does have some incredible set pieces, infact two helped pushed this z grader movie to a more b grade level. Primarily im talking the boat scene at the beginning and the zombie/shark attack (yeah , the eye scene was good but it is a typical gore scene that goes with these movies and really i look for a bit more in a good horror film. IT was was gross though :)

However these two scenes ,(boat and shark), on such a low budget,were directed with some skill and mastery that it made me re-consider Luci as a hack director that only had gore going for him in the Western Market.

The boat scene was quite grand and i loved the way it was filmed with both meance and dread as we see this ghost ship sailing into harbour alluding to the notion that not all is well on this ship and before we know it a large fiqure comes roaming up on deck. A fiqure that doesn't look well nor one i would want to bump into. It was simple and effective and sets a good tone for the beginning of the movie.

Impressive was to see the fight between shark and zombie and one of the the most memborable scenes in any zombie film including Romero's . I give a point alone for this scene as in it's time ( and even now).

Apart from those scenes i really didn't think there was anything in this film to rave about nor do i see it as a cult classic that deserves to be highlighted simply because it was a Fulci film.

To be honest there is much better zombie horror to quench yah thirst than this. I'm not saying the film is bad but you are gunna have to be a horror fanatic or drugged to be able to get and enjoy the film and even then it may be a bit lacklustered and i feel it doesn't have any really impact now days.

For me the Romero trilogy are old looking films that show in aspects of the filming making compared with todays but it still stands the test of time and is still worthy of cult status. By comparing Zombie to Romero's trilogy i am trying to show that i'm not JUST judging this film due TO its age. Night and Dawn were horror icons which assisted new filmakers in re-creating the horror scene and cementing horror as films with gore were for just the underground nuts but also for the main stream. Both Night and Dawn have underlying social commertories that elevated them to classic status due to the horror and intellgience in its scripts and settings.

Zombie IS an old zombie film but also a poorly excuted one. Alot of the action occurs in the final 30 min of the film and alot of poor dialogue is spewed out in the mean time. The actors all look like there about to hit retirement and really seem to all come from some bad english (British) soap at the time. The zombies are adequate but some scenes are simply stupid ie: i remember one scene where a girl stand on the border of a forest which goes onto a beach screaming as she watch a zombie slowly pull its self out of the ground, stroll over to her, and then bite her. I mean mannnnnnn, it is a zombie film and viewers are good at suspending belief but seriously, RUN GIRL RUNNNNNNNNNN! It sort of reminded me of a scene in Austin Powers where he is in a  forklift and runs over a guy that is miles away because all the guy does is stand there and scream, at least that was meant to be funny, but in this film it is just poor film-making.

There were far to many scenes like the above and the stupidy of the people made me switch off from feeling any true horror and besides the eye ball scene and shark there isn't much in the middle of this film to recommend.

In conclusion, i did like the film but don't think it is worth the praise in years to come as being any sort of cult masterpiece or even a decent horror film. It is a watchable film, with a few good segements and its certainly worth a rental or a purchase at a cheap price if you want to bulk yah horror dvd libray up with some rubbishy horror.

Its an old zombie film filled with some really good and really poor direction by a director that made alot of z- grade entertaiment that is remembered due to its gore level.

But judge the film on it own merit and one can see it is a pretty shoddy film.

For a classic horror zombie film go for Romero or my fav - DEAD ALIVE. These film are grander in scale, tightly directed and have a well written script with both horror and satire. Zombie is for those that have seen everything else and just want a zombie fix and like a herion addict they will take anything given too then after a while.

933702,5,6304819927,"You maybe even more confused after reading the reviewer Geoffery McNulty's, go at it.

Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 (known in the US as Zombie), was NOT made before George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, (known in Italy as Zombi), and later spruced up to make it more like Romero's. That was a first for me ever hearing that view. Romero's classic was made in 1978, and Fulci's Zombie (the US title now folks), was made in 1980, under the title in Italy as Zombi 2.

So, to set the record straight, and the folks in the know, know that this is correct, is that Fulci's Zombie (1980 - Italy: Zombi 2), was made AFTER Dawn of the Dead (1978 - Italy Zombi), to try and cash in on the sudden craze of Zombi-Dom, that the great Romero conjured up.

That said, there are 2 versions of this movie out there. This one, Zombi 2, the 2 disc set from Media Blasters label Shriek Show. And the other, just plain ole' Zombie by the excellent Blue Underground.

Both are the same exact movie. There is not more of the movie on either dvd. The picture on the Shriek Show 2 dvd set though is visibly brighter, maybe not so much clearer, but brighter, than the BU one. Both are very clean, and look excellent.

For your money, if you want extras, then this Shriek Show one is the way to go. Although I don't think it's really neccassary to hear the memories of the hairdresser on the set.

For overall picture quality, (is what I like), then the BU disc is the way to go. Not only does this disc offer the original English Mono soundtrack, it also has an Italian soundtrack w/ optional English subs as well. Both are Anamorphic 2.35:1. But overall, if it is the best looking, sounding, a/v, (audio, video), quality you're after, and not so much all the extras, then the BU single disc is the one to go with. I'm a completist, so being that, I guess it was my destiny to purchase both releases.

So remember folks, here in the good ole US of A:

- George Romero: Dawn of the Dead ( in Italy released as Zombi).

- Lucio Fulci: Zombie ( in Italy released as Zombi 2).

Hopefully this will alleviate any more confusion?

933703,5,6304819927,"Okay so I've seen Romero's dead trilogy about a thousand times. Who needs star wars when zombies are alot more cooler. So yeah Romero puts his cast of survivors in settings like houses, and malls, and for a special few an undergound military base. anyways all hell breaks lose, zombies create havoc and movie ends. I love Romero's zombies flick but they can get a bit formulaic. Fulci puts a different spin on the zombie film with zombie. Sure all hell breaks lose, and zombies create havoc but, there's some great storytelling done. The opening scene is probably as menacing and hair raising as any of the more famous gore scenes. Fulci also uses some great visuals. The settings are as beautiful with zombies as they are without. Sure inhabiting a mall might entertain audience fantasies, but how about tropical landscapes. I love the giallo twist put on the movie also. Rather than having social commentaries like commercialism is evil, fulci gives the film mystery by having the clues revealed in some horrific, and violent ways. The end scene is probably as memorable and classic as watching Ben die in  ""Night"". I understand where the negative reviews may come from. Romero was great at having killer audience grabbers in his films. Zombie is like the chaotic news set scene in dawn for 3/4 of the film. The other 1/4 is killer living dead action. There's good reason why zombie is not just another film about zombies terrorizing suburbia. Great locations, cinematography, and FX keep it praise worthy.",1105747200,,1508,4.867704280155642
933704,5,6304819927,"Before I begin my review, let me state that this is for the Zombi 2 25th Anniversary Special Edition 2 disc set.  There is a BIG difference between other versions of this film on dvd.  Let me also state that I am not going to try and sell you on the movie.  Everyone should already know how essential this film is to thier horror collection.  Then again, if you have reservations about zombie films then you may want to rent this first as any other movie.  Little is mentioned on other reviews about what kind of Special Features you get with this edition, that is where I come in...

Disc 1:

Main Feature - this is highly cleaned up from the Anchor Bay release of this film.  The picture is smooth and the sound is superb.  Definitely the best way to view this film!

Special Features:

Food For the Worms - an interview with Captain Haggerty (the large zombie in the beginning of the movie).  This was an interesting 12 minute profile on the little known actor...he offers some behind the set stories that were worth at least one viewing.

The Zombie Gallery - basically a slide show on different pictures and ads for the movie.

This disc also has a commentary and trailer...nothing spectacular, but nice to have when you've already seen this film 50 times!

Disc 2:  More Special Features!

Raising The Dead - An interview with the film's costume designer Walter Patriarca on how they decided to dress the zombies, design the ads, filming location etc.  Basically, it's a 6 minute interview with an Italian guy with a heavy accent, talking with a pipe in his mouth...turn up the volume and you should be fine.

Building A Better Zombie - This is the money shot of the special features;  a 97 minute-long documentary on the making of this film.  Subtitled, of course for most of the cast and crew interviewed.  Very interesting as they brought up some moments with the late Lucio Fulci and commented on their contributions to the film.  It is divided into 11 chapters and also adds insight into the way Italian horror films got developed at the time of this film.

An Evening With Dakar - The actor who played Dr. Menard's assistant Lucas.  Basically, he sings two songs in Italian with an acoustic guitar.  Though I didn't understand what he was singing about, I found it to be a strangely soothing 3 and a half minutes.

Zombie Trailer Reel - This contains 9 trailers for other films in this horror sub-genre also distributed by Shriek Show.  With trailers for gems such as Zombies' 3-5, and Burial Ground, it serves as a sample if you are thinking about exploring more of the Italian gorehound b-movies that specialize in zombies.

The first dvd I bought of this film was the Anchor Bay release.  While they have made many great film transfers to dvd, their version wasn't that good.  The quality was choppy, staticky, and affected my entire opinion on Zombie.  Having seen this edition, I found this movie to be the classic (mostly) everyone says it is.  Shriek Show/Media Blasters did an EPIC job restoring this flick!  With all the attention payed to detail, you can see how hard they worked on this edition.  If you want to own this movie, then I highly recommend the 2 disc 25th anniversary edition.  I haven't seen the single-disc Media Blasters version, so I can't comment on the quality of that one.  Either way, you won't pay that much more for this version of the film.  It's even better if you can find it cheap.  $26 bucks is definitely too much for this (or any film) on any level.  I found my copy at the local Best Buy for $14.99!  I recommend you do the same if you want to own this movie...anything under $20 bucks is also worthwhile if you are already a fan of this movie.",1105401600,4,3697,4.532526475037821

933737,4,6304819927,"Zombi 2, (Zombie in America), is an unofficial sequel of sorts to George Romero's Dawn of the Dead (Zombi in Italy).  Director Lucio Fulci had written this film, and since its subject was so similar to Romero's classic, Fulci asked Romero's producer for permission to use the title.  The result, is Zombi 2, a classic zombie film, with terrific make-up and gore effects.

  By today's standards, Zombi 2 is extremely slow-paced, but stick with it, and you'll be treated to a beautifully shot film, with a couple of classic scenes, (the underwater scene is unbelievable, and the eyeball scene is one of the most difficult to watch moments in movie history, even for viewers used to horror violence.)

  The star here though is the zombie make-up.  This film features some of the most grotesque looking zombies ever put to film; gritty and dirty, rising from the ground with worms crawling in gaping eye sockets (the famous image on a lot of Zombi 2's promotional material), these zombies look amazing.

The cast and crew were pretty average actors but that didn't stop me from enjoying this film.  The film starts off pretty slow in the beggining but Later on it picks up the pace and delivers some scares and gore.

The Zombies in this movie are some of the most decrepit, decayed ever in film.  These are not freshly dead zombies, but ones who have crawled out of the ground with maggots and worms pouring out of eye sockets.

933789,4,6304819927,"Well, what can you say about a movie like Zombie. It's an entertaining piece of low-brow, low budget 70's gore horror. What's it got going for it? Well, zombies, most notably. I like zombies, and these are a fine example of zombies, no doubt about it.  They don't look real for sure, but they're pretty gross-looking, which is almost as good.  I'm particularly found of the conquistador zombies, though they weren't wearing delightful conquistador hats, so they weren't used to maximum effect. They were nicely rotted though.  The zombies in this film are your classic Romero type both behaviorally and physically.(Though they are perhaps even more ponderous)  They're nicely photographed too Also, it has a scene where a zombie fights a shark. If that isn't reason enough to see a movie I don't know what is.(And for the record, it's obviously a tiger shark) The plot and script are nothing to get excited about, though they are a bit more competent than I'd expect, or is necessary for such a film.  It is a bit slow though, and could use either a few more zombie encounters towards the beginning of the film or a longer zombie climax at the end.  However, the slow buildup does make it seem more significant when there are actually plenty of zombies around, so maybe he made the right choice in pacing it slowly.  Fulci's films are constantly accused of technical incompetence, but I don't really see it here.  There is some rough editing, and the acting ranges from mediocre to bad, but it still is far more slick and professional than most people would have you believe. Gore is typically the selling point of this film, and it's pretty entertaining, if rarely the least bit convincing.  The whole splinter-eye thing is fairly disturbing, despite being less than convincing.  Overall, it's not as gory as people make it out to be,(It's substantially less gory than Dawn/Day of the Dead, Evil Dead etc.) but it still delivers pretty well overall.  It manages to generate some decent atmosphere occasionally, largely through the use of zombie pov shots.  The pov shots of the zombies emerging from their graves are particularly effective.  In general, the horror scenes are nicely done.  Not scary, but entertaining enough and generally well shot and composed. The soundtracks nothing to get too excited about, though I rather like the droning electronic theme they use during some of the more dramatic scenes.  It's particularly effective during the fight at the hospital, where it makes the scene bizarrely tragic. (poor zombies....)

I got the new Blue Underground DVD. It ain't much for extras but it looks great. Sadly, it doesn't have the classic rotted zombie head cover they used on the Anchor Bay DVD, but it's a good set overall.(that original cover is what first interested me in this film some years back)

Well that's it.  If you like zombie films, you should see this, if you don't like zombies, don't bother, and if you haven't seen any go see some Romero ones first.  If you like this you need to check out Fulci's later film, The Beyond  It's definitely a better film overall, with lots of nice visuals and tons of atmosphere to go with the zombies and gore and whatnot.(though it's not really a zombie film, even though it has zombies in it, if you get my meaning.)",1094947200,,3286,4.792553191489362

[Zombi 2]

(Italy - 1979)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Techniscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

When her father's boat sails into New York harbor with no one aboard except a murderous zombie-like creature, a desperate young woman (Tisa Farrow) enlists the aid of local journalist Ian McCulloch and travels to a remote island in the Antilles where Farrow's scientist father (Richard Johnson) and the few remaining inhabitants are under siege by walking corpses.

The movie which launched director Lucio Fulci to international acclaim following a long career in the lower echelons of Italian commercial cinema, where he helmed everything from comedies (HOW WE GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH THE ARMY) to spy thrillers (OH! THOSE MOST SECRET AGENTS) to well-regarded giallo shockers (DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING). Inspired by the worldwide success of George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) - released in Italy as ZOMBI, though Fulci's film is a 'sequel' in name only - this is also the most tightly-constructed entry from Fulci's 'golden period' (1979-82), due entirely to Elisa Briganti's uncluttered script (co-written with an uncredited Dardano Sacchetti), which foregoes the 'scientific' rationalization of Romero's universe for the voodoo and mysticism of old-fashioned zombie lore. Visually, ZOMBI 2 owes more to I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943) than DAWN OF THE DEAD, though Fulci's film places a greater emphasis on horror and physical sensation: Flies buzz around the blood, sweat and vomit of the island's makeshift hospital, where Johnson's dogged pursuit of a scientific explanation for the army of walking corpses is mocked by the constant rhythm of voodoo drums, pounding somewhere in the distance...

Johnson gives a nuanced performance as the emotionally frazzled scientist, desperate to find a 'cure' for the zombies before they overrun the island, and Olga Karlatos (MURDEROCK) is equally compelling as the doctor's highly-strung wife, whose fear of the growing zombie menace is eventually realized in the worst possible manner (her final scene is, without question, one of the greatest in horror film history, staged and executed with breathtaking flair). Other performances are less sure-footed: Farrow's expression of blank-faced bewilderment remains fixed for the movie's duration, and McCulloch is fairly nondescript in an underwritten role, while Auretta Gay and exploitation stalwart Al Cliver (Pier Luigi Conti) make little impression as the innocent bystanders who get caught up in the search for Farrow's absent father.

Smartly edited by frequent Fulci collaborator Vincenzo Tomassi and imaginatively designed by Walter Patriarca, the movie's low-budget production values are enhanced considerably by cinematographer Sergio Salvati - another Fulci regular - whose glorious widescreen compositions are alternately graceful and grotesque (the distant figure in an empty, windswept village which turns out to be a rotting zombie; the beautiful island landscape rendered alien by the onset of darkness, as the living dead loom out of the woodland surrounding Johnson's hospital; the army of corpses rising from the graves of long-dead conquistadores, etc.). The thumping music score by Giorgio Tucci and Fabio Frizzi has developed a cult following all its own! More than anything else, however, the movie is a showcase for makeup artist Giannetto de Rossi (HIGH TENSION / SWITCHBLADE ROMANCE), whose work rivals anything by Tom Savini and packs a visceral punch undimmed by the passage of time: Throats are torn out, guts are eaten, and skulls are skewered in grotesque, lingering close-up, and de Rossi's putrescent zombies make Romero's green-tinged ghouls look positively anemic by comparison! This is truly the stuff of nightmares, and while ZOMBI 2 has more to offer than mere grue, it's de Rossi's work which defines the film and has assured its place in the pantheon of 'trash' classics.

Having thus discovered his true fort, Fulci followed ZOMBI 2 with THE BLACK CAT (1980), a work-for-hire which short-changed audiences expecting another gore-fest, before he returned to the zombie/splatter subgenre for CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (1980), a disappointing shocker with pretensions of metaphysical grandeur. Fulci finally struck gold in 1981 with THE BEYOND, a dream-like meditation on death and guilt which many regard as his best picture.",1093392000,5,4358,5.485842026825633
933791,5,6304819927,"Media Blasters have been a godsend to us outcasts who like these kinds of films, but they've usually played second fiddle to the giants, Anchor Bay and Blue Underground.  Well, this new 2 disc edition of Zombi 2 is gonna put them right up there in the big leagues.  I'm not gonna review the film coz no one willing to buy the 2 disc version hasn't already seen Zombie.  I've heard that Blue Underground's transfer is fantastic, though I haven't seen that one myself.  If Blue Underground's is as fantastic as they say, it must be the best transfer of all time, coz Media Blasters' is great.  I can't imagine Blue Underground's being that much better than this one if better at all.  Media Blasters always work their butts off to offer some kind of interview on all of their dvds.  Even if it's only with the Key Grip of the film, they manage to get someone.  On disc 2 of Zombie 2 they manage to get just about everyone involved with the film with the exception of the cast and Fulci(obviously).  They interview everyone right down to the guy who plays the wormy zombie on the film poster.  Also the fat zombie from the boat in the beginning!  It's over an hour and a half long and very informative....maybe too informative.  Hope you like to read coz it's all subtitled.  Plus you get an additional interview with the costume designer.  Why this is not included in the documentary and is it's own special feature is a mystery to me.  Plus you get to hear Dakar, who played Lucas in the film(and also looks about 106 years old), sing a couple of his musical numbers on acoustic guitar.  Of course you get all the trailers and still galleries as well.  I haven't listened to Ian's commentary yet, but I can only hope it's better than his commentary on the Anchor Bay version.  Very highly recommended only if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise I'd suggest grabbing Blue Underground's version.",1093305600,3,1889,4.538461538461538

That was the first time anchor bay let me down on such a classic movie. Anchor bay did not bother to improve the sound or picture. As a result, a very dark muddy quality. Anyway, When i heard blue-underground was producing Lucio fulci classic ""zombie"" i fully took advantage of it.  starting at a low reasonable price i bought it right away. I was completely blown away by the crisp and clear transfer that blue-underground studios provided. Everything is ten times brighter, the widescreen transfer is so clear it makes the movie look like it was made 5 years ago. The sound is upgraded to 5.1 digital! A week later i found shriek studios was producing a 25th anniversary edition, (2-disc). Now im not too sure on how good the quality goes on this anniversary edition but i can re-assure you zombie fans that it is not as good as the blue-underground. I heard rumors that anniversary edition is better than the anchor bay version but not as good as the blue-underground. If you want special features stick with the anniversary edition, if you want to see your classic zombie flick look like a true masterpiece stick with blue-underground.

I believe this was a foreign film, and like other foreign horror films I have seen, there just isn't much action at all and it seems like nothing really happens until the end of the movie.  It doesn't mean you won't like it, but just in personal taste, I need a little more action.  Not saying it was a BAD movie, it's just too dry for me.  Also, the score to this movie was extremely repetitive, not scary, and perfectly illustrates how important a creepy score is for setting the ""mood"" in a horror flick.  That just doesn't happen here.  The things I like about the film were that I thought it was well directed, and the gore, while definitely over the top, was effective and fits right in with a zombie movie.  All in all, I don't plan on watching it again, and I would much rather watch Dawn of the Dead than Zombie, I can't wait for the Bells & Whistles Edition of Dawn of the Dead to come out on DVD on 9/7!",1091750400,6,1143,4.144796380090498

Skip this version and instead purchase Blue Underground's new release or Shriek Show's 2 disc Special Edition with a doco about the making of the film (if you can be bothered learning about it.)

I like a lot of Fulci's stuff, but for probably all the wrong reasons. He's a pretty bad director when all is said and done. Others can try to argue that fact but they're clearly only getting off on the gore quotiant in his movies. You certainly don't seek out a Fulci flick for the brilliant performances or master craftsmanship of his editing/pacing and camera work.",1091491200,,650,4.547008547008547
933829,3,6304819927,"Just had a chance to review Blue Underground's release of this Fulci classic. The transfer is beautiful (far superior to the earlier Anchor Bay release) and the 5.1 English mix is terrific. It's great to have the Italian audio track available even though the movie was clearly shot in English (even though the dubbing still never syncs up you can see that it matches better than the Italian version does.)

It was common practice in Italy to revoice everything anyway - I guess recording location audio was just too much trouble.

I haven't had the opportunity to see the Shriek Show 2 disc collector's edition yet to compare picture quality but it would appear that the audio on Blue Underground's version is superior - looks like a mono mix only on the 2 disc version.

I'm curious to see how much reinstated footage Shriek Show provide - I'll probably end up buying both versions as I am a horror movie completist and I want to see the doco that's included on the 2nd disc of Shriek Show's version.

It's going to be hard to beat Blue Underground's version for picture quality though - the print is virtually flawless, which is a lot more than you can say for the movie itself. Fulci was never a great storyteller or visual stylist - he sure knows how to pile on the gore though.

Great menu design on this DVD also - I love the moving worms that pour out of the Zombie's face. Real sick.

The film begins in the Caribbean, where a scientist shoots a undead corpse in the head. ""The boat can leave now."" Cut to New York, the said sailing ship is drifting in the bay. Cops go onboard and are prompty dispatched by a ravenous zombie. Thus Fulci's blood soaked epic begins. The film has some really extreme gore scenes, zombies are dispatched with bullets to the head, being set on fire and other gruesome methods. The dead body count is high and the humans don't fair much better. One bit of trivia, when the zombies are walking over Brooklyn Bridge watch the cars below. Fulci couldn't get permission to film in New York so had to get shots as quick as possible before the police would stop them, hence the New York traffic going about it business while the world is being overrun by the undead. Overall the film is pretty entertaining. In the UK when this was first released there was over 3 minutes of cuts. Still today the official UK release is cut.",1091059200,,1054,4.611702127659575

933832,5,6304819927,"When you think of the all time great zombie movies George A Romero's trilogy ""Night of the Living Dead"" , ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Day of the Dead"" most likely come to mind. Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"", which has been called a sequel to the above mentioned ""Dawn of the Dead"", doesn't seem to be as popular and not as well known (at least around here) as Romero's trilogy. However, I believe Zombie is almost as good as the above mentioned
Plot is simple; Tisa Farrow plays Ann Bowles, when Ann discovers her father's boat to be abandoned in the New York Harbor her and reporter Peter West(Ian McCulloch) go searching for answers. Their search takes them to the small island of Matool where an unknown virus makes the dead stand up and walk, and of course they do much more than just walk. The plot is so simple yet extremely effective. The movie does move a bit slowly and the acting isn't very impressive but everything that makes a great horror movie is presented, creepy score, spooky elements, extreme gore and the most realistic, best looking zombies of any zombie movie I've ever seen.
This was only the second Fulci film I've seen but from seeing those two movies and reading other reviews it's easy to see a couple of Fulci's trademarks, bad dubbing and extreme gore.  The killing scenes were awesome!! A big splinter through an eyeball, zombies feasting on dead woman's guts (that's pretty nasty!) and my favorite, a zombie tearing at the jugular of a woman as blood squirts out and shoots everywhere. If you haven't seen this movie yet and your a fan of horror movies add this one to your collection!!",1089849600,12,1606,4.59581881533101

This DVD is dreadful. The video is OK: non-anamorphic and a bit muddy, but reasonably clear most of the time and at least it's the original aspect ratio. The audio is tinny and hollow, sounding like those old badly mastered ""bathroom acoustic"" LPs where mono albums were turned into stereo.
The trailers etc are good to have, but the commentary by the lead actor (who's never seen the movie before) and a magazine editor is boring when it's there - and usually is silent.
There isn't even time code information to tell you how far into the movie you are, and there's no chapter display. Also the chapters listed on the box and the DVD menu do not correspond to the chapters on the disc.

933835,4,6304819927,"Repeated.
First, this movie from an entertainment value from 1 to 10 is a 10 plus.
Second, this movie from a technical visibility and technical audibility release value on DVD from 1 to 10 is a 4.
Reason for the first critique: The PROS
1. Director Lucio Fulci directs a fast paced nail biter from start to finish.
2. Excellent film scoring as the music really accentuates the drama.
3. Excellent casting, the actors are solid for this type of film -  no phonies.
4. Excellent locations - from New York City to the exotic Carribean where the two main characters meet up with vacationers who agree to charter their boat and take the main two characters to the island of Matool where the horror begins - you'll know why there going there as you see the film.
5. Excellent makeup effects for zombies and the gruesome and great death scenes.
6. Excellent cinematography to heighten the tension during the film.
Reason for the second critique: The CONS
1. Anchor Bay Entertainment's DVD release of this movie is poor. This critique of poor DVD quality is rare when it comes to Anchor Bay Entertainment releases as their remastered-from-the-good-old-cellar-movie reputation normally puts out excellent quality DVDs with full frame-by-frame color correction, removal of original picture blurriness, and excellent audio track remastering, but this movie somehow slipped through the cracks as perhaps there was a rush to get this movie out on DVD due to its immense popularity among gore hounds and Fangoria Magazine fanatics. The rush job to DVD certainly shows. And below are the main points to look out for on this particular Anchor Bay Entertainment release.
2. Poor picture clarity. The picture from start to finish is viewable, but not at all crisp and without blur. This will be corrected see ALTERNATIVE DVD below.
3. Poor color management. The color from start to finish lacks vibrance and richness. The color frame-by-frame is as dead and bland as the zombies themselves. The opening scenes especially as the abandoned yacht( or so you think ) sails into New York Harbor as it is coralled by the New York police, you will see that the city buildings including the World Trade Center towers look more purple/grey in tone, the harbor looks dark brown-grey in color, the sky looks grey in color, and the facial tones of the characters look more fuscia-pinkinsh-beige. The color on this release is horrible and will be corrected. The most frustrating aspect of the poor color is when the movie shfts to the Carribean as two main characters meet up with two vactioners and the four somehow agree to sail for the Island of Matool, after some hesistancy, you will see that the color really suffers here. The exotic locations - the beautiful water, the green of the palm trees, and the like are painfully lacking the vibrant standout color correction needed to make every film frame standout with crisp clear picture quality and life like color. This will be corrected see ALTERNATIVE DVD below.
3. Muddled audio track. The sound is clear, but not at the level of a remastered audio track with either DTS or THX Sound treatments. The musical score periodically steps on the sound effects  This will be corrected see ALTERNATIVE DVD below.
4. From the original uncut full-version, there are some scenes missing on this DVD. This will be corrected see ALTERNATIVE DVD below.
5. Periodic purple outlines on the edges of the widescreen black bars.
This will be corrected see ALTERNATIVE DVD below.

Coming from Media Blasters Entertainment, another respected DVD Production Studio in the same ilk as Anchor Bay Entertainment and Blue Underground Studios a two new releases of this film are on thier way.
The first will be a Special 2-Disc Fully Remastered ( Picture and Sound ) 25th Anniversary Edition Anamorphic Widescreen Transfer due out as Amazon.com states on the web page hosting this title as July 27, 2004.
--This DVD has 2 hours of Extras including Director commentary, Film Trailers, TV-Spots, Cast and Crew interviews and audio options. This version is the one to buy and as of this review is only less than two months away.
The second will be Single Disc Fully Remastered ( Picture and Sound ) Anamorphic Widescreen Transfer due out I would suspect around the same time as the 25th Anniversary 2-Disc Edition in late July 2004.
Final Thoughts:
1. Avoid buying the Anchor Bay Entertainment release if you can wait less than 2 months from todays date June 13th. The wait will definitely be worth it. If you own this version already as I do, then I would recommend donating this release to the local public library for a tax break when the new versions, especially the 2-Disc set, come in.
Expect from the newer versions as a recap.
1. Excellent Frame-to-Frame Picture Quality from start-to-finish and Full Elimination of Film Blur.
2. Excellent Frame-to-Frame Color correction bringing the movie to life.
3. Excellent Sound Treatment for fully enhanced dialog clarity, punchy sound effects, and a robust musical score getting more crisp.
If these do indeed happen as Media Blasters Enterainment Studios are indicating, then this film goes from a 4 to a 5 plus.",1087084800,19,5190,4.916761687571266

Just wanted to kindly make that correction, as people may think that if it's being put out by Anchor Bay again, that it will be the same transfer as before. But it is noted on the description of the movie on this page that Media Blasters is the distributor this time. This particular dvd has been in the works for sometime and is one of the most anticipated releases of this year. This dvd's release date has been moved up a few times as this was originally slated for release a few months before this new date. But I don't mind waiting because this is usually a sign for the most part that the company putting it out wants everything exactly right, the way it should be. And we Euro-Horror/Zombie fans want our movies to look the way the Director intended it to look, in all its blood soaked, gut ripping, eye gouging glory. This sounds like it will be the complete uncut version, and I've heard the letterboxed version of this movie shows more info on all 4 sides of the picture where as the Anchor Bay, although letterboxed also, did not. There's about a minute or so of footage that was not included on the Anchor Bay release that is included on this dvd. Also, a good part of the main actors & crew that were in this movie were tracked down & interviewed by the great Kit Gavin, and should be excellent watching. I'm very interested to hear what they have to say about this movie after all these years, and hopefully some great insight about the production of movie itself.

933867,5,6304819927,"The recent remake and release of Dawn of the Dead had a friend of mine and me waxing rhapsodic about the horror fims of our youth.  One afternoon we were talking and he mentioned that he had received a copy of Fulci's Zombie, one of the rare films that neither of us had seen, and popped in the first ten minutes that afternoon.  ""This abandoned boat floats into NY Harbor.  The NYPD investigates only to find a bald, scaly zombie in a closet who takes a nice chunk out of the neck of one of the officers.  Hilarity ensues.""  I had to see this movie.
It takes quite a lot to get me squirming while watching a horror flick.  This buddy of mine and I pretty much laugh through almost every flick we see and MST3K a good portion of the running time. (While at home, never at the theater.  Well.... almost never.) Through the first half hour of Zombie we were our normal selves; snickering and tossing in horribly inappropriate lines that just seemed necessary at the time.  Once the band of ""heroes"" got to the island though, that stopped.  Well, for a while anyway.
The topless hottie SCUBA diving generated a few comments but the second she ran into the submerged zombie and the tiger shark the chuckling gave way to subdued utterences of ""cooooooool"".
A lot of the acting was laughable, most of the dialogue was horrible, but the direction and effects were nothing short of amazing.  I recently watched the original Dawn of the Dead on DVD and remember thinking that the film was near perfect, just ripe with horrible makeup. (Zombies the color of pale smurfs just don't scare me the way they used to.)  If Romero had the effects people from Zombie he would have had the perfect Horror film.
The English dubbing was pretty bad, which is strange seeing as all the actors were speaking English on screen.  The last forty five minutes of the movie are amazing and include; the aforementioned zombie v shark battle, a woman getting her eye poked out (A Fulci staple I am told) and one of the greatest stands against a zombie onslaught ever filmed.  The one complaint I had was the fact that none of the molatov cocktails seemed to ignite anything and the scenes of them hitting the oncoming army of the undead are obviously the same shot repeated over and over again.
Be sure to turn up the sound so you can hear the radio at the end of the flick.  What you'll hear is a little cheesy, but pretty darn frightening just the same.",1080518400,,2424,4.467120181405896
933868,5,6304819927,"With Dawn of the Dead, under the title Zombi, making bank in Europe, it comes as no surprise that enterprising companies would come up with ways to grab a piece of the pie.  One such company was Variety Films, who grabbed a script by Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti, and hired journeyman director Lucio Fulci (prior to Zombie, Fulci was mostly known for directing several controversial giallo thrillers - Lizard in a Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling) to make it. The resulting movie was titled Zombi 2.  I guess you could think of it as a prequel to Dawn of the Dead, maybe.
A derelict boat drifts into New York harbor.  On board is a deranged man that attacks and kills one of the harbor patrol.  The daughter of the boat's owner and an english newspaper reporter attempt to solve the mystery behind the attack.  The clues take them to a Caribbean Island named Matu.  There they learn the nightmarish answer to the blood curdling mystery.
Zombie is arguably the best of the Italian Dawn knock- offs.  Fulci creates some memorable set pieces in as an atmospheric manner possible, given the low budget and lack of time.  Gruesome fun for fans of zombies, Fulci, Italian shockers, or plain old gory horror movies, or all of the above.  Recommended.",1078617600,2,1260,4.6909090909090905

933870,4,6304819927,"Originally perceived by critics as a Dawn of the Dead rip off, Lucio Fulci's Zombie is an over the top gorefest that has become a classic among fans over the years.  Featuring some of the most realistic looking zombies ever to be seen on film (they're rotting and decomposing and look brilliantly disgusting) and plenty of memorable scenes (including the infamous splinter in the eye scene and the beautifully shot underwater battle between a shark and a resiliant zombie), Zombie is a gorehounds' dream.  The story is simple, a few inhabitants of a cursed island all become chow for a horde of zombies, but it works for the film as it is simple, unsettling gorey horror Fulci style.  There's no social commentary or dark humor like in Romero's Dead trilogy or Dead Alive, just pure horror all the way; and while it may not be as profound as Fulci's The Beyond, Zombie is still a more than solid horror flick worth seeing if you have the stomach for it.  Anchor Bay has assembled a solid DVD for the film (they always do great jobs for cult horror films on DVD) with enough extras to satisfy most fans of the film.",1075680000,83,1114,4.555
933871,4,6304819927,"""Zombie"" is often cast in the same ring as George Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy, though the two are very different in both plot and subtext. Lucio Fulci was known as the Italian ""king of splatter"", and this movie cashed in on the zombie movie craze of the late 70's that Romero almost single-handedly developed. ""Zombie"" is not a great movie, but horror fans will find plenty to love in this gory and very campy flick.
""Zombie"" has none of the social commentary and comedic undertones of ""Dawn of the Dead"", rather it explores the origins of zombie legend and is a straight-forward horror film. A boat belonging to a renown scientist washes up abandoned in New York harbor, abandoned except for a single Zombie that falls into the harbor after being shot. The daughter of the scientist (Tisa Farrow) teams up with a British reporter (Ian McCulloch) to find out what happened to her father. They travel to Matul, a supposedly cursed Caribbean island which is in the midst of a zombie epidemic. As you can predict, bloodshed is just around the corner. As far as horror movie plots go, this is above the average. As the DVD inset proudly contends, this is ""One of the most graphically depraved shockers in horror history"", so fans of splatter are in for a real treat. The violence is heavy and drawn out, with plenty of dismemberments and organs being spilled. The zombie themselves are more anatomically correct than those in ""Dawn of the Dead"". Many of them are rotten and falling apart, Fulci himself nicknamed them ""Flower pots"". Anyone who has delved into Fulci's other movies can appreciate his penchant for extreme gore and over-the-top music to accompany it. This is perhaps Fulci's best movie besides ""The Beyond"".
Anchor Bay DVDs have always been reliable in giving cult horror movies the respect that they deserve, and ""Zombie"" is treated with a modest, but quality DVD package. The big extra is the Audio Commentary by star Ian McCulloch and Diabolik Magazine editor Jason Slater (who can provide little more than fan insight). It is entertaining for the most part, but it does have it's share of gaps. The rest of the extras are the usual promotional spots, including theatrical, TV, and radio spots. The one drawback is that it is only available in dubbed English, rather than the original Italian language version (which is not even an option). At times, the dubbing is terrible in this movie. But other than that, this is a solid DVD for horror fans to sink their teeth into.
Going into this movie expecting another ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not wise, since the movies are very different, but it is enjoyable on it's own level. As a long time fan of horror movies, I can easily say that ""Zombie"" is a cut above. The Anchor Bay DVD is an easy purchase for fans.",1073952000,5,2770,4.70164609053498
933872,5,6304819927,"Are you ready to be confused? Zombie (1980) is Fulci's 33rd film as director but this is his first Zombie movie. It is better known as Zombie 2, Island of the Flesh-Easters, Island of the Living Dead and Zombie Flesh-Eaters. Now there is also a film called Zombie 2, but this is in fact Zombie 1, the same movie. Confused? You should be. All these title problems date back to the day when distribution rights in the Western and Eastern hemispheres where totally out-of-sync, coupled with greedy distributors trying to get in on the tail-coats of some other popular movies. Bruce Lee films also suffer from this same mess. This film is originally called Island of the Flesh-Easters, but is probably best known as ""Zombie Flesh-Eaters"" and this title certainly sticks better than any other because there is only one ""Zombie Flesh-Eaters""! When it was released in 1979 the distributors called it Zombie 2 in order to cash in on George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" also released in the same year (it pretended to be its sequel because Dawn of the Dead was also known under the title ""Zombie""). This turned out to be a bit of a mess and so it got its US release under the title Zombie (1980) but is the same film as Zombie 2 (1979) and Zombie Flesh-Easters (1979).  Unfortunately following in the heels of DOTD did nothing to help Fulci's little masterpiece and the critics panned it. They mostly called it a sick attempt to cash in on Romero's work. This unfairly branded Zombie Flesh-Eaters as a rip-off.
Zombie Flesh-Eaters is a film about a doctor (an unrecognizable Richard Johnson from The Haunting) who is experimenting with half-human zombies on a Caribbean island to find out what is causing the strange epidemic. In New York a drifting boat from the Caribbean turns up in the harbor with a nasty surprise. The owner of the boat has gone missing and his daughter teams up with a news reporter to investigate her father's disappearance only to end up traveling to the Caribbean to solve the mystery. There they meet a local boat driver and his girlfriend who take them to the strange island where the doctor is working on the zombie plague. The movie then picks up the pace and soon everyone on the island is in jeopardy. Apparently the reason for the Zombies is some form of voodoo that the islands inhabitants are up too; however this is never fully explained.
Needless to say this has all the hallmarks of Fulchi's style. There are many shots that go way past their sell-by-date and the film does seem to stall at times. However as soon as the group meet up on the island it is pretty much action packed from there on in. Zombie Flesh-Easters is mostly credited for the following items on display here.
- A very realistic battle between a zombie and a REAL shark underwater.
- The eye-piercing splinter sequence.
- The doctor blasting the heads of corpses wrapped in white sheets throughout this movie.
- The end stand-off which features lots of ""spade meets zombie head"" brain-bashing work.
As it stands this is a very good zombie flick which has all the grit and dirty feel that you can expect from something with a title like - Zombie Flesh-Easters. It does have a number of problems such as special effects that are slightly below standards for its time, a very long winded beginning and several plots that are not exactly explained. However when the zombie smashing gets going it really gets going and the gore is well up there with the best of the them. This film also boasts a surprise shock twist ending. In short this is a Fulci zombie masterpiece that should not be overlooked. It is grim with a medium effects budget and has that dirty feel but you get exactly what you paid for in aces.",1072828800,15,3706,4.615151515151515

There is only one slight problem, a doctor's experiments have caused the dead to rise from their white, sandy, tropical graves in search for food and you can guess what they like to eat.

""Zombie"" is one of Lucio Fulci's better films of his uneven catalogue. The zombie make-up is well done (unlike the disappointing make-up in ""City of the Living Dead""), the tropical location is beautiful and original (for a zombie film) and the gore sequences are at times, spectacular. There are some extremely explicit scenes of throat, face and arm-munching and the infamous eyeball scene is very well done as Fulci piles on the suspense (we see the victim's eye get closer and closer to the jagged splinter) and the awful moaning in the background just adds to the terror.

Unlike Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" which was generally received well by critics, Fulci's zombie apocalypse was mostly panned. It has managed to rise above the bad press to become one of the more popular zombie films by hard-core fans of the genre. Both film's were released during the late seventies but despite the subject matter, there are major differences between the 2 films and ""Dawn"" edges this one out by a lot. Those who just want to watch a film about the living dead wreaking havoc on the living, will find plenty to like in Fulci's ""Zombie"". The pace is not flawless so keep this in mind as the first quarter of the film is slow. Once the action gets started however, those with weak stomachs will be in for a shock.

Not for the squeamish, not for the faint-hearted, ""Zombie"" should please zombie/gore fans. For those unfamiliar with Fulci, ""Zombie"" is a pretty good film to start with. It's not ""Gone With the Wind"" but for those morbid individuals who crave this sort of flesh-ripping, eye gouging unpleasantness, it come's pretty close.",1069545600,,1927,4.763473053892215

When the camera moves, the image is ""flickering"" continuously, and this is throughout the whole movie. Very bad indeed. This kind of digital disturbance is really annoying and I was aware of it all the time. I read many good things about Anchor Bay (who did the transfer), but, I must say to them ""shame on you!"".

Fulci does a wonderful job in developing a movie that contains a good storyline and great zombie effects. The movie flows real well from the beginning as the zombies are very quickly introduced.

933899,5,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci's Zombie, is one of the top 5 zombie movies of all time.
The high points of this movie are the gore, the atmosphere, and the zombies.
The gore, while slow getting started, is top quality. How do you know top quality gore? Well..if the thought of eating something later that day, makes you queasy while watching the scenes..that is probably a good indication. There are some very memorable gore scenes in this movie(the wood splinter through the eye is probably my favorite).
The atmosphere on the island is secluded and filthy, and both of these qualities benefit the movie quite a bit.
The zombies are at times some of the best looking zombies from any movie..ever. When the zombies look to be actually decayed and rotting..these are the zombies that I am speaking of. The zombies that creep and seem brainless, with only the instinct to eat..these are the zombies I am speaking of.
The low points of the movie are some of the silly situations the characters get into and the zombies.
The characters find themselves often getting sidetracked into some pointless situations..like taking pictures underwater or making out while you are running from zombies. While this does always allow for a zombie to come into the scene, it also makes you laugh and takes you out of the moment.
The zombies, while sometimes are the best looking ever on film..other times, they are the worst. You have some zombies covered in dirt and worms with rotten teeth, and then you have others that look like they just had a small amount of white make up put on them, and allowed to carry on as they see fit. These same horrible looking zombies, tend to be way out of zombie character..wrestling with sharks, having the brain capacity to push a womans eye into a splinter(instead of just eating her). Once again, these scenes tend to lead to gore etc., but it is just frustrating to see such well done zombies in one section of the film, and such horrible zombies in others.
Overall, this film is fantastic, and is a must own for any zombie movie fan or gore fan.",1065744000,2,2050,4.650137741046832

But then again, what do you expect from a zombie movie?  It really seemed to want to borrow an idea left from some Romero Dead flick, but the voodoo twist wasn't imginative, though it was original?  Perhaps not though, seeing that I haven't viewed EVERY zombie film ever made.  It was a nice looking horror film though.  It really had a lot of breathing space, and the scene of the underwater battle with the shark is classic.  The story basically begins with an abandon ship floating in New York harbour, and the coast guard check it out.  Little do they know what's aboard.  Then the story bounces over to the city itself with a reporter hearing about the ship and wondering what happened exactly.  He goes to check it out and contacts the daughter of the owner of the ship.  She comes along with him to snoop and then they get the bright idea, from the reporter's boss no less, to go to the island from which it was sent.  And that's where I'll leave it.  It didn't do it for me like Romero films did, but the gore was just perfect for a zombie film.  One of the better zombie films though, from what I can recall.",1062979200,,1276,4.2845188284518825

Well, the plot full of loopholes is one and plus the lack of extras for this film.  The commentary is OK and the trailers and commercial ads are OK too, but there should have been alot of more extras to go with this movie.  If you want see another Fulci movie, check out The Beyond (which I wrote a review on also).  This doesn't top the Beyond, but it is a very effective zombie movie.",1062720000,,712,4.115942028985507
933903,3,6304819927,"I nearly gave up on this movie when it got to the underwater Zombie and shark scene. If you haven't seen this film, about 1/2 through, there is  a hilarious scene. It starts with a topless female scuba diver going down into the ocean to take photos. Once down there, she is attacked by a shark and a zombie. The diver manages to get away. So the zombie decides to attack the shark. Is this suppose to be  a comedic scene?
Beyond  the horrible monotone acting and the annoying soundtrack, the film actually redeems itself once they get to the island. The zombie makeup is excellent. However why do some of the victims just stand there and let the zombies attack them? Why didn't the woman take her hand and move the jagged board before it jammed into her eyeball? Why do some zombies fall down after getting shot while others continue to walk towards their victims?
The scene with the zombie on the cover is excellent, it upgraded my review of this film. Plus, the DVD has awesome bonus features such as radio spots, TV commercials, theatrical trailer. Also, inside of the DVD box, is an alternate movie poster used for the film which I like much better than the one on the cover of the DVD. Also inside is an excellent sypnosis of the history of the film.
Everyone seems to think this film was a rip off of Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" ...although the script for Zombie was written first. In my opinion, Fulci did a much better job than Romero. Fulci's zombies were scarier and the makeup was better. Plus, the basis for the zombies in the films are different. There has been documentation of voodoo potions and voodoo doctors trying to create zombies for decades. This is the basis for ""Zombie"". Romero's zombies are based on a whole different idea.

I braved 50 minutes of this ... transfer before giving up (I didn't want a migraine)--even the lackluster commentary didn't keep me hooked on this, because I was too busy being distracted by the ... poor mastering (and is it just me, or do the on-screen movements seem to be occuring at a fraction of their correct speed?).

The first by the common critics, the second by the devoted fans.
As almost every other Fulci film the opening credits hook you at first sight. One dark and thrilling line followed by white on black credits with nothing but the gorgeous music delivered from Fabio Frizzi (and Giorgio Cascio). But, as many other posts suggest, much of the first part of the movie is a bit slow. Even though (or perhaps because of) the acting and dialogue is one of the best seen in a Fulci film, we don't really see many things to keep our interest up for a longer time. Some dustbuster-sequences (like the infamous shark sequence and ""the splinter in the eye""-scene) and overall fabolous musical score at times makes it all worthwile after all.
The last 15-20 minutes or so is fabolous Fulci stuff, complete with groovy gore, great action all excitinly shot and delivered (when our friends discover the cemetery is a highlight).
In conclusion: A bit uneven, yes, but one of Fulci's most inspired and macabre works and overall a trustworthy classic worth watching, at least if you're into horror.",1057622400,,1304,4.774336283185841

This is one of the great man under zombie siege films-and thus the two levels of alienation:  the obvious one where our lead characters are separated from the rest of the world, but also the subtle metaphor/allegory that seems to be in all the Romero movies, and which Fulci marvelously borrowed for this film, of the zombie=drone=modern man slowly cut off from vestiges of humanity until all that's left is the automaton, (or taken to its logical conclusion, because life is also a process of humanity) the undead zombie.  As for the stupidity part, this is where the movie becomes a little confusing, as we aren't given any definitive reason the zombies have started to bee-bop across a Caribbean island in the first place; is it a disease or is it voodoo, and if it was voodoo, why the heck raise flesh-eating zombies in the first place?  Other elements of the film coalesce into a triumph as well:  the soundtrack is, along with Suspiria's, one of the few truly creepy soundtracks; the make-up effects for the zombies are mind-blowing, to say nothing of the violence they wreak; there is the shot of the zombies slowly crossing the Brooklyn Bridge towards the city; finally, because it is so novel, there's that shark wrestling scene near the beginning.  As for DVD extras, there is a commentary track, but it isn't very long.  There are some good radio/television promo spots, but that's about it.

No real plot, cheese for production values. Of course for the real fans of this genre/sub genre none of that matters (give us gore, then more gore) if your not a true fan you should not be watching an Italian horror flick anyway, let alone one with a title like Zombie!

(especially the part where the woman gets the splinter of wood shoved into here eye, it made me and my friends cringe when we watched it) There are even some interesting plot twists, (the zombie fighting the shark for instance) and some predictable things (the woman scuba diving in practically nothing) For the most part it was a good movie, although a little slow, but the last 30 minutes or so made up for it with some fast paced zombie action.

I thought that I had been ripped-off and I almost took it out of my DVD Player. But, I didn't. The first 30 min. are really boring, but after you've seen the movie a couple of times all the way through, you can just skip it. There were some great scenes that will (and have been) be written in history as some of the greatest moments in a movie. (Splinter breaking off in the eye, anyone?)

Those who know Lucio Fulci, know his horror epics dispense classical logic and replace it with exploitive violence and gritty atmosphere. Fulci-fanatics love this disregard for typical moviemaking and know that beneath his ""B"" grade films lurks artistry and genius. Cameras pan and zoom throwing off the viewer who expects generic dramatics, and when violence occurs the average cut away shot is replaced with a close up, of the actual bloodletting. The island atmosphere blows sand like fog and the detail of the sets, wardrobe and make-up seems almost oozing scum. But the combination of all this help create a memorable and masterful zombie cult classic. Some even say better than 'Dawn of the Dead!' *gasp* But this was only the beginning of Fulci's voyage into shameless horror. If you are bizarrely pleased with ""Zombie"" be thankful. Your journey will lead you to ""House by the Cemetery,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" ""New York Ripper"" and his horror masterpiece ""The Beyond.""

933966,2,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci's best known movie opens with a seemingly abandoned sailboat that nearly collides with other boats along the coast of New York City.  The Harbour Patrol board the boat, to find it a mess and abandoned.  Well, nearly.  One of them is attacked by a monster and killed.
The boat's identified as belonging to the father of Ann, who went to the Antilles for some research and from whom she hasn't heard of in three months.  She teams up with Peter West, a British reporter living in NYC who dissatisfied with the police's version of the story, finds a letter from Ann's father, who had contracted some strange disease on the island of Matoul.
The two get there with the help of Susan and Bryan, a couple on holiday.  However, Dr. Maynard, in charge of the hospital, has problems on his hands to the point that he wraps his patients in sheets, ties them down, then shoots them in the head as they rise up.  When he welcomes the quartet, the zombies have already started attacking, even killing the doctor's wife in a scene where her eyes gets pierced by an attacking zombie.  That unfortunate victim is played by Olga Karlatos, known for playing Prince's mother in Purple Rain.
Following the movie are movie and TV trailers, and a few radio spots for the movie, which aren't much to scream about.  However, one of the movie ads boasted the distribution of barf bags to the audience.  Amusing.
While achieving the shock level of flesh-eating zombies, blood gushing out from jugular veins, and heads squirting out blood when shot, there aren't many outstanding or appealing characters.  Plus there's no credible or scientific explanation, other than voodoo rituals, of what caused the zombies to start popping out of the ground, which by the way is one of the neat effects in the movie.  The grotesque look of the zombies and the siege on the church is best enhanced on a big screen.  Worth a look once in a while, but highly overrated.

This was the most successful of the Italian knock-offs of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, much like FRIENDS was a successful rip-off amongst the SEINFELD clones. The film in its own right spawned a load of knock-offs, some of whom were probably packaged as ZOMBIE 2,3,4 etc. Blatantly ripping off whole movies is entirely acceptable and fully encouraged in italian filmmaking.
  The film, is quite simple, it involves an island plagued with flesh-eating zombies and the small group of characters who are drawn there for personal reasons. I really don't feel like summarizing the simple plot of ZOMBIE but its fairly enjoyable. The special effects and make-up of the zombies is done pretty well, and there are some truly ghastly moments of various people running afoul of the bloodthirsty creatures. Its safe to say that this is not for the faint of heart. Mr. Fulci(the late, great director of this undead cannibalistic munchfest) does not cutaway from the gross-out moment, but instead lingers as a truly horrible and gory moment unfolds.
  There's action, gratuitous nudity, and more zombies than you can shake a greiviously empty carbine at! So get yourself a copy if you can from the fine folks at Amazon[.com].",1044403200,5,1317,4.972727272727273

This movie is so depressing that it actually makes you think about what you would do if you were in this situation!  Lucio Fulci takes you into the world of ""Zombie"" and keeps your mind in it for hours after the flick.  I wish that words could in fact give a good enough example of just how great this flick is, but they just don't.  Okay, here's the breakdown of the film:
1. Very, very impressive and believable Zombies.
2. Wonderful storyline.
3. Decent voice-overs.
4. Great setting.
5. Right up there with the scariest flicks of all time.
6. Lucio Fulci found much better actors.

8. Contains trademark ""Gore Scene"" from Lucio Fulci.
9. Did I mention Great looking Zombies?
If you haven't been scared by a movie in a while. . .purchase this movie.  If you haven't seen a decent ""Zombie"" movie in a while, watch this movie.  Or if you haven't seen a decent movie period, give it a shot!  You won't be disappointed!!!!",1036540800,2,1242,4.563063063063063

The only low points of this film are the dubbing and the occasional ropey acting. But the astounding shark scene and the gruesome deaths more that make up for that. The other thing i like about this film is the zombies, Fulci's zombies are always the best, slow, decayed and sinister looking.

So to be brief, great fx, great atmosphere, decent acting, awesome soundtrack (an absolutely haunting keyboard theme by Fabio Frizzi), great gross out scenes, and a decent (though minimal) plot. The plot's simplicity leaves much to the imagination. There are some beautifully shot, breath taking scenes such as the underwater zombie/shark fight, and the ressurrection scene in the jungle. This film is nothing less than beautiful. Some might find it outdated, but what do they know? A movie doesn't have to be hip and modern for me to enjoy. In fact I quite disslike ""hip"" films. So if you're interested in checking out some of Lucio Fulci's horror films, this is the one to start with. Now, about the dvd. I don't see what the big fuss is. The sound quality is satisfactory, and I can hear more sounds in the music than on the video tape from the same studio. The picture quality is crystal clear and quite beautiful in places, and satisfactory in others.

934046,5,6304819927,"Zombie is one of those DVDs you can pop in on a boring night and laugh while getting into the film's palpable atmosphere of growing dread.  Director Lucio Fulci is slowly being rediscovered by the next generation; this film, along with The Beyond, The New York Ripper, and House By The Cemetary, is one of his best.  Fulci is a master of gore effects, and in fact the actual zombie makeup found in this film is possibly the most realistic I've ever seen.  Not that I see many zombies in real life, but the gritty makeup jobs--replete with such quirks as worms falling out of eyes--are highly convincing.  Another major draw is the film soundtrack, especially the eerie title tune which ranks up there with the music to ""Halloween"" and ""Suspiria"" in its ability to creep you out and make you leave the lights on while viewing.
Still, there is plenty of camp to be found herein.  Obviously this is a low budget film, and despite good cinematography, the film stock is grainy.  Much of the dubbing is downright embarrassing, especially the scene where Fulci himself, playing a newspaper editor, is speaking--none of his words match up.  In reality Fulci spoke little English.  Also, some of the characters are a bit strange: such as the couple who allows the protagonists to tag along on the boat.  Brian, played by Al Cliver, seems like some kind of hippy who just happens to be able to pronounce ""Conquistadores"" in perfect Spanish.  His wife has no qualms about scuba diving topless only minutes after meeting the other two people.  Olga Karlatos plays the beleagured wife of a scientist determined to study the zombies; here she looks much younger and prettier than in Purple Rain, even though it's only four years earlier.  And it is she who gets the splinter through the eye.
In summary, Zombie is not an Oscar winner, but rather a near-perfect genre film with unforgettable set pieces and enough comic relief to hold its own against any comparable film.",1033171200,2,1957,4.740412979351032
934047,1,6304819927,"Zombie is a very good genre film. Although paced very slowly, at times Fulci creates a fully realized atmosphere of gloom, dread and the fantastic. There are several outstanding set pieces also, most notably the climactic shootout.
It is worth seeing, as it hints at the zombie film greatness that would be fully realised in the astonishing The Beyond and the exquisite, faultless House By the Cemetery. This is not to say that Fulci didn't make great films before Zombie, as Four of the Apocalypse and Don't Torture a Duckling showed Fulci's control, mastery and subversion of the spaghetti western and the giallo.
Anchor Bay have done some great transfers (most of the above) and also a grainy but still watchable transfer of City. So I was horrified when watching Zombie, because this dvd is plain awful. I saw this on a TV broadcast in England and the picture was clearer and the colours were more vibrant. There is virtually no colour at all, everything is far too dark, and worst of all, it feels like it might have been copied from a VIDEOTAPE. ...
The only appeal of this dvd for me is to see the film in its original aspect ratio, and uncut (I'm from England, so everything's badly censored).
In my opinion, DON'T BUY THIS DVD ...! I don't think I've seen another dvd of such low quality. Shriek Show are going to release this properly, although they've delayed the release from Sept 24th 2002 to a now unknown date. They've also said Zombie's ""a sore subject"", so maybe it doesn't look too good.  Let's hope they do it soon and well because Zombie deserves better. Fulci is a consummate visual director.

The shark/underwater zombie scene was also original.
The soundtrack was actually quite good. It's erie and futuristic (for the time). Every now and then, I catch myself humming the main theme.

Now, even the most rabid of Fulci fans ( I consider myself firmly in that category) would be the first to admit that Lucio was never going to be an Oscar nominee. If you want Oscars, buy a movie with the inane ramblings and narcissistic posturings of Kevin Costner. You want a thoroughly enjoyable romp with zombies, gore, women and a Bontempi-Style music score ?? Fulci is your man.
""Zombie"" tells the story of a reporter investigating the strange discovery of a seemingly abandoned boat found drifting in New York Harbor. Our man teams up with the daughter of... Look, it's got ZOMBIES !! Neck-munching, intestine-slopping, eye-gouging ZOMBIES !! The non-vegetarian scenes are really well done, everything we expect from Maestro Fulci including a now-legendary Fulci trademark eye gouge, IMO the best he's done (although you should check the claw gouge in Demonia..)
To sum up, don't expect to be intellectually stimulated, just sit back with some buddies, lower the lights, turn up the sound and enjoy the movie for what it is :-)

934052,3,6304819927,"This movie is known as ""Zombie flesheaters"" in the UK, and trying to obtain a decent copy of it has been a big problem for years for us Brits. It was banned altogether as a ""video nasty"" during the 1980s and the version that was finally reissued on video about ten years ago was ruined by excessive censorship. Even the ""extreme"" re-release which is now available still suffers from a couple of very brief cuts, which seems particularly pointless in this day and age when it's so easy to buy the full version online.
The film stars Ian McCulloch (from the mid-70s cult TV series ""Survivors"") and Tisa Farrow (Mia's less talented sister) and begins as an apparently deserted boat is spotted drifting through Hudson Bay. A harbour patrol boat draws up alongside and two cops climb aboard to investigate. One makes the mistake of going down into the cabin to look around, and very soon the score is already Zombies 1 Humans 0....
The boat belongs to a famous scientist who set sail for the Antilles three months earlier but has since disappeared. His daughter Ann (Farrow) and journalist Peter West (McCulloch) decide to go and look for him, after reading a letter he sent from the island of Matul, in which he talks about contracting a mysterious disease.
They fly to the Caribbean, hire a boat and are soon on their way to Matul, where they meet Dr David Menard who has been carrying out experiments on the disease, not believing local superstitions that it's caused by voodoo. Although the visitors are sceptical when he claims that it turns its victims into the ""undead"", before long we see compelling evidence that he might be correct....
Most classic gore movies have a particular moment that everybody remembers and in this case it's the notorious ""eye-gouging"" scene, but there's plenty more excellent gore on offer, as well as an amusing interlude involving a shark (possibly included because the movie was being made while the whole world was still in the grip of ""Jaws"" fever) and a very corny ending. The acting and dialogue aren't great by normal standards but well above average for a film of this type, and although the pace of the film is initially a little too slow, once our main protagonists arrive on the island it picks up very quickly. And considering the low budget Fulci had at his disposal the special effects are pretty good too.
A lot of people find the soundtrack music annoying and it's certainly a little too loud at times. Featuring extensive use of the noise-generating capabilities of some primitive analog synth, the film's more dramatic moments tend to be accompanied by a crescendo of electronic belching noises, and there's also a rather tedious refrain which you have to endure over and over again. On the plus side, there's plenty of ""voodoo"" drumming which, when used in combination with the aforementioned synth sometimes manages to sound like primordial techno....
""Zombie flesheaters"" is as good as it gets from Fulci, and IMHO is the only serious rival to George Romero's ""Dawn of the dead"" for the title of best zombie flick of all time.

Fulci has created a movie similar to Romero's in that it explores the zombie vs. man theme, but that's about as far as it goes. ""Zombie"" (Zombi II) is more in line with Universal's 'voodoo zombie' flicks of yesterday then Romero's social commentary in 'Dawn.' I think the voodoo theme works very nicely and plays out with more straight up 'dread' than did Romero's ""Dawn"" which had it's lighter moments. Very nicely done.
As for the gore....it's not AS extreme  as you would think, but still nice. The infamous splinter eye-gouging was awesome...one of the best I've ever seen, and then there is some nice throat ripping and one scene of eating of entrails and such, but ""Dawn"" seemed much more explosively graphic to me.

934117,4,6304819927,"First off I give this movie 4 stars for a zombie flick. By regular mainstream movie standards this is probably a 1 or 2 star movie, depending on how easily offended you are. But as far as Horror/Zombie movies go, ZOMBIE is the best I've ever seen. The film has some really excellent cinematography, which really surprised me. The story is nothing ultra innovative but it's got some nice additions to the standard zombies come to life and eat people plot. The gore is not as over the top cheesy like ""Bad Taste"" or ""Evil Dead"" but there is plenty of blood and chunks of people everywhere. Also there is some boobage for those who like their movies naked. The movie as a whole has many cool scenes (Zombie vs. Shark is much neater than I thought it would be, not even in the dorky sense. I never thought a Zombie fighting a shark could be radical, but here we are)
The Video on the disc is kinda washed out and grainy. It's not really any better than a vhs copy. At points there are large patches of distorted color, and the blacks are actually dark blue. But this actually kinda adds to the movie and gives it more charm than if the film had been digitally restored. It is widescreen. The Audio isn't spectacular but isn't bad. Everything is heard very easily from voices to the bitchin' Zombie attack beat that appears throughout the film. The disc also includes TV and Radio Commercials and a commentary, which I haven't listened to.
Overall if you even remotely like Zombie movies, or cheesy horror movies, then you should already own this film. It's almost to good to be a B-horror movie, and I'm sure that will offend many fans. A surprisingly well-acted and well-filmed movie, Zombie has some great special effects and fight scene. Well Worth the Price of admission for any Gory movie fan.",1025827200,6,1794,4.540123456790123

We have the RATINGS people to thank for that. If you want to find out more about that, you need to listen to Wes Craven's audio commentary on the Scream movies. The RATINGS MOB, Threatened his movies with an X rating if he didn't shorten Scenes and delete others. Thats why he made it a sudden scare movie, instead of gore. That is also what stops other films from becoming great. Film Studios will never spend millions on a film they can't release in Theaters. Second it is VERY well done. There are no lines or age spots and it is not dated. It has a very Modern look to it. Third even the timming is right on, along with the acting. I also want to add this Film has a very costly underwater shot to it, and it is so clear, It remined me of the underwater shots in the James Bond films.

01. There are ""tracers"" when the actors move. Mostly in the
  beginning, like when that NYPD officer gets neck-chomped...
  His face moves a bit then his cheek moves around a bit more.
  The tracers alone are worth seeing this movie.
02. The Italian to English dubbing is so horribly wonderful.
  ""The skipper of that boat must be a real turkey"" ...you
  die hard zombie freaks know what I'm talking about, If not
  listen for it. The dubbing is off just enough to make it
  even just that more trippier.
03. The score to the movie is great, couldn't be better. Nice
  and creepy. The voodoo drums thumping throughout the flick
  is classic and builds up tension.
04. Nothing but eye candy! I have a fairly impressive zombie
  movie collection and hands down LUCIO FULCI is the man. The
  effects, make up and the entire ""shark v/s zombie"" thing
  OWNS! The gore in the movie is realistic and the eye popping

  doesnt pull to the left or the right?!... but she's a
  trooper and takes it right in the eye. Then the splinter
  breaks off at the base and she's nothing but ""Zombie Chow""
  after that.

  friends over and pop this puppy into the DVD player.
  ZOMBIE has everything you ever wanted in a horror movie.
  Bad acting, confusing story, bad dubbing, great music and
  lots of gore. This DVD comes loaded with stuff too, some of

934120,3,6304819927,"...of course that's not saying much, but this is a very enjoyable film for what it is.  This film was originally titled ""Zombie 2"" in order to cash in on the success of George Romero's amazing ""Dawn of the Dead"" (which was called ""Zombie"" in Italy), and is Fulci's first horror film (or at least his first successful one) (he did romantic movies beforehand).  In an attempt to tie this film in with ""Dawn of the Dead"" (the two have nothing to do with each other; ""Day of the Dead"" is the actual sequel) there are some scenes which take place in New York City at the beginning and end of the film, but mostly it takes place on an island where zombies are apparently being raised through voodoo as opposed to toxic chemicals (although this is not quite made clear and you never see the voodoo practitioners but only hear their drums).
The action never lets up, so the film never gets boring unlike most of Fulci's films, and it has some of his best special effects, which are especially impressive given his low budgets.  One brilliant scene which almost makes the film worth purchasing has a zombie battling a shark underwater! (""Jaws"" had recently also been released).  If he had more scenes like that, the film would really rock.
There was only one scene I found pathetic, and that is the ending where New Yorkers are supposedly fleeing the city to escape the zombie infestation: you see zombies marching towards the city high above a bridge while car horns are heard blaring, but the shot of the traffic below shows normal, not even rush hour traffic, heading both directions in and out of the city! And since the traffic scene was not necessary, that can't be fully blamed on a lack of budget, but poor planning. Other than that, this film lacks Fulci's usual boners.

Don't get me wrong, the zombies and gore look incredible. And of course, a certain eye gouging scene is immaculate. Also, the plot and acting are solid enough... just not solid enough to make this movie interesting. Plus, a horrible soundtrack doesn't exactly help.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer and restate that the Zombie battling the Shark Scene and the Eye Gouging scene were most EXCELLENT!

*Bunch of tourists get stranded on a tropical island
*Said tourists get relieved of their internal organs one by one. That's it, guys. No pretense at character development or narrative drive--just lots of gore. But character and narrative were never Director Fulci's strengths, were they?
Many reviewers here claim that Fulci's Zombie flicks were Romero rip-off's.  This is true, for the most part.  It has also always irritated me that Fulci always disputed this fact, claiming that his zombie ideas came from Haiti and the RKO film noir zomibes of the 40's.  Oh yeah, Fulci?  Did those Black and White flicks have explicit gore and the idea of killing zombies with a blast to the old noggin???
On the plus side, these zombies ARE a lot more horrifying than Romero's in Dawn of the Dead, and there are thankfully few dull spots. On the minus side is the infantile script and (non) acting. Worth buying, but it would take director Lucio Fulci two more films, until, THE BEYOND, before he truly had command of his craft.

The last half-hour, in particular, is intensely frightening. Despite some negative reviews, I found this an often suspenseful and scary film, and certainly one of the best of its subgenre.

I hadn't gotten around to purchasing the original Anchor Bay issue DVD, and then it went briefly out of print, and I didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg (pardon the bad pun) for used ones, so I waited in hopes that maybe it would show up again.
Well, lo and behold, Anchor Bay re-issued the DVD, and I quickly bought it with anticipation; after viewing it, I felt that it was not quite what I had heard it was. The special effects were good, but not great (the zombie makeup was better than the actual gore), and the acting and dialogue dubbing were subpar, which Fulci's films are noted for.
Overall, I wouldn't say I was completely disappointed, but I wouldn't say I was overly impressed, either; considering that most of Fulci's films were low-budget affairs, the effects were good, but I don't feel that the film lived up to all of the hype and ""infamy"" bestowed upon it as being so gory and disgusting.

I cannot believe that there are still 23 seconds cut from the UK version of this film, including the infamous spike sequence.  It really is not that offensive or particularly convincing.  Gianetto De Rossi's zombies are great.  It is about time this was released uncut in the UK (it was made in 1979 for god's sake!!).  Whatever furore it caused at the time of its release, this now stands as a classic Euro-horror film of the late seventies.  Richard Johnson gives quite a good performance, and Sergio Salvati's photography is top notch. My only real gripe is that, during the final battle in the Church/hospital, Fulci replays the same shot of the first 'molotov cocktail' exploding in front of the zombies about five times!  On the Anchorbay version, listen to the commentary by Ian McCulloch - it is hysterical in an up-tight English kind of way.

Like so many films from Italian filmmakers, ""Zombie"" follows a similar path where one can expect a plethora of bloodshed and violent murder, all stitched to a story that exists solely for its makeup effects. Add to that a cast of B-list and unknown actors, and English dubbing that never fits the movement of the characters' mouths, and you have a formula for yet another cheesy horror movie that is sure to become (and has become) a cult classic.
It opens with the obligatory suspense setup, in which an unmanned sailboat meanders aimlessly throughout New York harbor. As the Coast Guard investigates, a strange, corpse-like creature rips out one officer's throat before he is shot by the second, falling into the water Is he really dead? Can the undead even be killed?
Getting back on track, Ann Bowles (Tisa Farrow) the daughter of the boat's owner, becomes worrisome when told that her father was not on board the vessel; after crossing paths with reporter Peter West (Ian McCulloch), the two embark on a journey to Matul, a small, uncharted Caribbean island where a Dr. Menard (Richard Johnson) has been performing tests on fatally diseased patients from a small village.
The ""zombie phenomenon,"" as it is dubbed by Menard, is never really explained in detail. First we are informed that the villagers suffer from some form of widespread disease. Down the road, the movie changes course, turning to elements of voodoo and witchcraft; though this seems the more likely path, it still remains uncertain. And while it is of little importance, it does tend to nag one if thought about in excess.
And speaking of excess, you may not find a collection of gore as shocking and gruesome as what ""Zombie"" has to offer. Once on the island, Ann and Peter, along with shipmates Brian and Susan, seek out Menard to inquire about Ann's missing father, whom they are told died of the disease. All the while, corpses are rising out of the ground, from the hospital beds in a converted church, to an old Spanish burial ground, ready to take a bite out of anything that lives and breathes.
Some of these images are hard to shake from memory: in one of the movie's most famed scenes, a victim is impaled through her eyeball by a wooden splinter. Later, we return to this gruesome scene to witness various zombies chowing down on her remains. Despite their rancid appearance, the makeup is undoubtedly realistic, and provides for a chilling shock factor that does evoke a slight degree of suspense.
However, if you've seen one attack, you've seen them all. From there on, it's mainly a vomitorium of zombies taking large bites out of victims' throats, arms and legs, all of which is propagated by massive amounts of dark, gushing blood. I hate to say it, but it does tend to get old after some time, and as the movie begins to reach its climax, culminating in a showdown where the remaining survivors are trapped in the hospital surrounded by zombies, the predictability shatters the energy.
For horror buffs and gore aficionados, ""Zombie"" is a must-see. For those familiar with the works of George Romero and the great Dario Argento, Fulci's film will seem like just another exercise in repellant horror, a copycat film that is less appealing and less entertaining.",1012953600,3,3506,4.787128712871287

934210,5,6304819927,"Lucio Fulci nailed it with 'Zombie'. It is the quintessential zombie film. Pay no attention to the mindless critics who would have you believe this is a lame rip-off of 'Dawn of the Dead'. As a pure zombie film, it beats 'DOTD' in all aspects. The rip-off theory comes from the simple fact that distributors attempted to present 'Zombie' as a sequel to 'DOTD' in Europe, in an attempt to cash in on the success of 'DOTD'. Otherwise, it doesn't remotely resemble 'DOTD'.
Fulci's zombies are digusting, putrid, decaying, mangled corpses, which is what fans of the genre desire. They are simply the best representations of zombies on film. You won't get any of Romero's 'powder-blue' zombies in this film. The make-up & special effects are surprisingly good for a 1979 film. The zombie vs. shark sequence is great! The plot is very simple & effective: a missing doctor's crewless sailboat leads his daughter & a reporter to the remote island of Matoull, in the Antilles. The island is cursed, and soon zombies are closing in on all residents. The recently-dead are returning to life, as do some other 'surprise' guests of Matoull. Time is running out, and there's nowhere to run. Pretty frightening plot, if you think about it. Flesh-craving zombies aggressively seeking out every living being on a remote island, with a fittingly apocalyptic ending.
There's plenty of Fulci's trademark over-the-top gore, but it is spaced out well-enough, as are the zombies that appear onscreen, so as not to become the focal point. Fulci creates a genuinely creepy, barren atmosphere on the island as the film progresses. It seems to be is style to move things along a bit slowly, but it in no way hinders the film. It's not a love story, it's not about the characters, it's a zombie flick and it triumphs as such. You'll enjoy this film more each time you watch it.
I've seen many reviewers here label Lucio Fulci a hack, while heaping praise on the likes of Dario Argento. I must say it's a bit confusing. Fulci presents a much more enjoyable experience than anything I've seen by Argento. Fulci's work never comes off as pretentious,or taking itself too seriously, or 'too brilliant for the viewer to understand'. His work is far superior to that of Argento's 'arthouse' unwatchable trash. If you believe the hype about Argento and the panning of Fulci, you are certainly missing the superior horror experience.",1012608000,21,2397,4.863080684596577

They tried to pull this off as a sequel to DOTD which didn't work then they later got sued by the production crew od DOTD (lol).

I found Zombie to be a pretty good and enjoyable Zombie movie that I thought was no where near as bad as it's reputation suggested. The plot involves a young woman teaming up with a nosy newspaper reporter to find out what happened to her father on a creepy island called Matuul. When they arrive on the island with two other people, they meet Dr. Menard, a weird scientist who doesn't believe in Voodoo but does kind of believe in Zombies, and he better, because the island happens to be crawling with them! The movie takes place at an island for the most part and it deals a lot with Voodoo, which was often used to bring dead people back to life. The Zombies in this film are some of the BEST and most realistic I've ever seen, and they look way cool and way nasty. The way they are bought back to life (probably by Voodoo) is believeable and oftentimes I really thought these Zombies were real! Plus the movie has a GREAT musical score, a lot of creepy scenes, nice sets and locations (the island was a pretty good setting for a Zombie movie) and the gore is VERY disgusting and looks very real. Punctured Eyeballs, Ripped Throats, Exploding Heads, Oozing Blood, gorehounds will find a lot to like and this movie is definitely not for kids and those who are squeamish. I also liked the finale (which was very exciting) and the ending is super-cool, and the infamous Shark scene (although short) is a riot. Overall, while Zombie is no Night Of The Living Dead, it's a pretty good Zombie movie overall. It's a little slow and boring at times but picks up and it has a lot of good moments. See this film if your looking for a good (and creepy and gory) Horror movie.",1006905600,6,1685,4.421221864951768

934244,4,6304819927,"To a fearsome extent, this Zombie story has it's roots in reality. Hello, I have been a fan of zombies since I was a 12 year old who saw Day of the Dead for the first time. I've seen a lot of the Zombie movies since then, and although most were unattractive, this one in paticular fits right in there with Romero's series.
And not just because of the gore, either. That's what a lot of people like the movie for, and even though I hate to ruin the mystery why the dead walk in this movie, I'm going to tell it in this review, since most people miss the reason when they watch the movie anyway.
One word: Voodoo. A belief that most civilized people discard and ridicule. But uncivilized people, however, know better, espeacially if they are Haitian. Ever since the French enslaved the people of the country now known as Haiti, a darkness was given birth to the religious beliefs of the land's inhabitants, and though Zombification is only part of that evil, it's the most terrifying aspect of the religion. People here in America might fear Death-Row for their Criminal behaviors, while people there in Haiti, fear to be zombified. The Haitian government allows it. And Zombification is a lot scarer of a punishment than Death-Row in my opinion, due to the fact that you're not only dead, but your soul is enslaved by a Voodoo priest, who is now empowered to control your physcial mortality, that's supposed to be buired six-feet under.
This movie is more and less about the same thing (except the Zombies that walk the graveyards in Haiti don't eat human flesh) but Lucio obviously got the idea from the old French-African resurrection of the dead. The island the people visit in the movie, is dominated by a voodoo tribe (throughout the last hour of the movie, all you hear is the tribe screaming in the background and pounding on their drums) but what's really disturbing, is that you never see the tribe, which is the main reason why I think a lot of people miss the answer to the question why the dead walk there. No, the island isn't Haiti, but just as primitive.
We go through the usual blood splattering, throat slashing and gut wrenching terror that we enjoy when we watch any Zombie movie once the visitors of the island learn that it's true the island is infeasted with walking corpses. A praise-worthy attribute. And not to mention the horrible task of your mian Characters who are left with no choice but to kill their loved ones who have fallen victim to the Voodoo curse, and VISE VERSA. {{GRINS}} That's always nice to watch. And there's this impressing scene--never seen anything like it in a movie--where a Zombie is feasting on a live shark at the bottom of the ocean. Lucio should of made the JAWS movies, because this was a real Tiger Shark, not anything plastic. WOW! The acting is a little off, but as far as Zombies and fantastic scenes like the Shark-Scene, you're going to see believable and convincing footage throughout the film. It's not fake at all. I rate the movie four stars. If you're into SERIOUS, DISTURBING horror, this is a must see.
If you're looking for a more FACTual depiction on Zombies, I suggest the movie, 'The Serphent and The Rainbow' which I believe was directed by Wes Craven.

934245,4,6304819927,"This unofficial Italian prequel to Romero's Dawn of the Dead (which was called Zombie in Italy) is actually a pretty nifty little low budget horror film in and of itself.
A derelict boat drifts towards New York City.  When the Coast Guard climbs aboard to investigate, the officers find a gnarly zombie waiting to be fed.  When the daughter of the boat's owner meets an investigative reporter researching the horrifying incident, the two decide to join forces.  They fly out to St. Thomas to look for the missing man and the answer to why the horrible thing was on the boat.  What they find is an island hell of the walking, flesh eating dead.
Although it won't win any points for originality, Zombie is nonetheless an energetic exploitation movie that benefits greatly from strong atmospheric direction by future cult director Lucio Fulci, who was making his horror film debut here.  Further pluses include fine gruesome make-up effects from De Rossi and an excellent electronic score.

934306,5,6304819927,"One day I was out walking,I live in the south in a place that has a very subtropical temperature during the summer. Sweat pours and humidity hits you. I came on a dead animal lying at the roadside apparently struckdown by a car. I think the poor thing was a squirrel. Blood and some other fluid leaked out and the head was completely crushed. It had a sickly sweet smell and the greenbottle and houseflys swarmed. Their young the maggots could be seen slowly turning the animal into a rich protein broth for them with their acidic saliva. The feeling of disgust,revulsion,and abit of darkness reminded me of how the film Zombie makes me feel. That is not an insult! Those are not pleasant things to feel but when a horror movie can capture those feelings and also a frighten you and make you feel helpless to your own impending doom and leads you to some mystic insight to think could the dead rise and murder the livng?What would it be like to be ran down by predatory corpses?Yes this movie is what horror should be about. A horror movie is meant to be a waking nightmare and this is what Zombie captures.
 The plot is quite simple and the movie can be slow in parts. An empty looking boat appears in a New York harbour and the cops go on it to investigate. However this boat is not completely empty. One of the cops discovers this when he goes below deck and ends up having a living corpse bite his throat out. The other cop shoots it in the chest. It falls into the water seemingly dead. Now the zombies in this film must be shot in the head to be killed. The boat is from Matool a Carribean island. A girls father was at Matool and he has disappeared and not returned. She and a guy decide to go and look for him. They meet a guy who owns a boat and his girlfriend or wife. No one wants to go to Matool but eventually the man with the boat ends up taking them. We see a doctor living on Matool whose wife is living in a sort of paranoid terror. Now why could that be?We see the islands third world hospital that is about as sanitary as a city of homeless people living in boxes. All the sick of the island lay in dirty cots moaning and waiting for death to over take them. You can practically smell the fever sweat and the reek of death by just looking at this hospital. The movie starts getting pretty good from here. If you do not like gore do not watch this! However it rise above most gory horror movies because most horror movies with huge amounts of gore just focus on gore and are not scary and have no frightening atmosphere. This movie uses gore in a way that combines it with nightmare images and atmosphere to make this movie rise above so many stupid modern horror films. Lucio Fulci so tragic he is not with us anymore. He is someone that knew how to make horror. The plot to this movie is quiet simple I gave out a good deal of it. That does not matter though. The feeling and look of the film is more important than the plot like all true works of art this movie must be experienced to understand what makes it unique. This movie may not be for everyone but if you have never seen it and what I described sounds to be something you would like buy it,because if you like that sort of thing you will love this and want to watch it over and over because in the realm of zombie horror this is one of the best. You will like the look of the zombies,they are mostly all quite decayed and very frightening. Some have worms squirming in their empty eyesockets. These were not the freshly dead they really did look like what bodies buried in a third world country in a shallow grave in the jungle with a cheap and poorly made casket or no casket at all that has layed in the moist heat for years. Great camera work also especially the shots seen from the point of view of the zombies rising from the grave. If you take horror seriously watch this movie!",999561600,3,3864,4.235772357723577

For every great shot of a Zombie emerging from the earth(love that one p.o.v. shot from a Zombie's eyes as it rises, dirt spilling away from it's view) there are several minutes spent with unattractive, uninteresting characters discussing things. It's not too much to ask that a low-budget exploitive Zombie-thriller have more than just sadistic gore scenes to recommended it(that eye/splinter scene still makes me wince). 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie' both have fleshed-out(sorry) characters to care about and root for, and Z-grade entries like 'Zombie Holocaust' and 'Nightmare City' are more even in their pacing.

934313,3,6304819927,"I can't believe I'm actually going to say that I found Zombie an entertaining movie.  I mean, it's dumb and cheesy, but director Lucio Fulci does create some creepy sequences as well as an enjoyable all-out action-packed finale that features some of the best zombie action I've seen (probably second only to Day of the Dead and perhaps equal to Dawn of the Dead).
The movie does start out in terrible fashion, featuring incompetent camerawork, lazy acting, and horrendous dialogue.  Eventually, things get quite interesting (and entertaining) when one of the characters decides to go scuba-diving topless (while also wearing a very small thong), and encounters a shark AND a zombie.  From this point to the end (approximately 60 minutes) Zombie is quite riveting and packed with action and gore.  It doesn't hurt that Fulci's direction actually becomes fairly competent 1/3 the way through the film and doesn't really on the annoying closeups and sweeping shots of the first half-hour.
The plot is deceptively simple.  A boat ends up in the New York harbor, with two officers rummaging around inside, discovering a zombie.  One cop is killed, while the other one kills the creature.  The boat is linked to Ann Bowles (Tisa Farrow), since her father owned it.  She and reporter Peter West (Ian Mcculloch) head out to search for her father in the island of Matool, getting help from a couple (Al Cliver and Auretta Gay).  Arriving to Matool, the island seems peaceful enough until the dead begin to rise and the remaining human survivors must find a way off the island.
I've read so many mixed reviews of Zombie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Many said it was horrifically intense, while others claimed it was the most boring film they'd ever seen.  It's not the most terrifying film ever made, but I can say that with the exception of the beginning, it's hardly boring.
Fulci handles the gory and action-filled moments quite well, which is what makes the movie watchable (or unwatchable to those who don't have the stomach for it).  Many, many zombies are either shot, burned, or bashed in the head with several different objects.  The finale is full of action, as the survivor hole themselves up inside a hospital while dozens of zombies break in from all sides.
This film is not, I repeat, not as good as Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead.  The script doesn't resemble anything intelligent and the characters aren't particularly well-defined.  Tisa Farrow is basically the woman who DOESN'T take her clothes off.  Ian McCulloch is only okay as the reporter, while everyone else is either there to kill some zombies, get killed and eaten or show some nudity.
The movie's most well-known for gore and the make-up effects, which I must say are very impressive.  These zombies are unlike any I've seen in any other movie, looking gruesome and decrepit, certainly a creepier design than the grey-painted zombies of Dawn of the Dead.
As a whole, I'd say Zombie is a suitably entertaining late-night horror feature.  There are improvements it could have used.  The first half-hour could have done with better direction.  The characterization could have been better, and the screen time (once the fun gets going) could have been an extra 10 minutes longer.

934345,3,6304819927,"From the opening shot of ""Zombie,"" I had a clue as of what to expect from this movie. It was going to take itself seriously as far as the gore, but possibly make us giggle at the hammy acting and sly attempts at satire. I was almost totally correct. The gore in Lucio Fulci's involving zombie chiller is horrific and abundant. It's an all-out everything-must-bleed wholesale! Zombies and humans die in the most gruesome ways you could imagine, and through all the thick, soupy redness of the Karo syrup, Lucio Fulci carries his own unique style through the movie. He slowly piles on the gore, starting off at a good pace, then steadily increasing the dosage like the antibiotic perscription of a doctor strategically fighting off an infection.
The film opens with a human form wrapped up in bedsheets slowly rising to a sitting position. Then we see this form get its head blown off by the supervising physician of a small hospital on an uncharted island near the Phillipines (I think). We learn later on that the rising form was the father of the film's star, Tisa Farrow. She gets involved with a journalist after an abandoned boat with a member of the living dead floats into New York Harbor and a police officer is murdered. Farrow knows that the boat had to have come from the island where her father was performing his medical research, and the mystery of that figure (who the police deny even exists) make the temptation too much to resist: She must go to the island to uncover the hidden facts about the murder of that cop and why an empty boat found its way into the harbor. With two guides, Farrow and her reporter companion go to the island. But it's when the female guide, who loves to scuba dive nude, by the way, is under the surface of the ocean that things really start to come to light. ""There's a man down there!"" she screams, climbing back into the boat. How can a man exist at the bottom of the ocean without air? Answer: He can't... unless he's already dead.
""Zombie"" has many memorable scenes and an annoyingly catchy musical score which accents one of the best shots of the dead rising from the grave that I've ever seen. Sure, George Romero showed us the living dead in the way we envision them today, but it's Lucio Fulci who shows us exactly how it happens, and it's Lucio Fulci who takes us back to the roots of the first zombie stories: Voodoo curses. If I could, I'd give this film three and a half stars instead of three. This is mostly due to the film's style, it's realistic makeup effects, and I still cannot get over that whole splinter through the eye thing. Bravo.",988156800,,2600,4.510593220338983

Sure, the shark scene is silly, and God knows New Yorks Finest certainly expends enough bullets into living folk that you'd think 1 zombie wouldn't be a problem, but if I had to sum up my feelings on this film I would do so thus:  My grandmother (true story) had taken me to see this film when I was 14.  Years later, on one of my visits to the nursing home before her death, she told me could sometimes still see the zombies coming across the Brooklyn Bridge. Disturbing? Maybe. Touching?

You got to love this hack imitator for all his captivating visulals when it comes to his visual sense on film, other than that there is really nothing else to value in this man's work. You either call the guy a hack or a genious,..but i have to call him miss-understood. He did actually  mold one darn good film, and without doubt his best: Don't Torture a Duckling (1971) and he did make some pretty good films like: The Beyond (1981), and House by the Cemetary(1980),..and he also made alot of crap...to say the least. And this film, Zombie(1979) was his first of his many of his Zombie/Romero imtitaions, and what an Overated piece of tripe it is(on a Fulci fan stand point of view). Not to make myself seem all hypocritcal--but after such films like his Beyond(1981), I became rather intrested in the mans work . Here is a film, ecaspically in it's opening reels, that weaves a wistful spell of poetry, oneiricy, and to a point, sort of H.P Lovecraftian vibes. So what did i do, i searched for more Luci Fulci movies, and i got this! This piece of tripe that i heard coutless times as being of of Fulci's masterpieces. Yeah Right, Pal! This movie came-off more as a pitiflly bad spanish Porno-complete with the bad acting, and that embarrasing film score. Not to mention Fulci's rather typical Lacklustre direction, Some ugly filming locations, and actors who can't act. I imedailtly sent the tape flying at high speeds back to...-hoping no other curious onlooker would be tempted to rent such rut. After that i had enough of Fulci-yet as time went by i was tempted to yet again rent another one his films. This time it was his seedy Sleazy but-otherwise-surprisingly good New York Ripper(, which i found rather entertaining, and quit intresting as well. I'd call New York Ripper one of Fulci's second string good efforts And ten times better than...this film. This piece of porno-bound-trash.  Yet Before I finish trashing this film altogether--i have to comment that this film has the strong point of being one of Fulci's most coherent Blood-baths--even more coherent then such better efforts as The Beyond, and the so-so yet intresting City of the Living Dead (1980). Other than that u have a movie that will only intrest Gore & Fulci Hounds...and for the rest..""STAY AWAY FROM THIS IF ALL POSSIBLE"" - I heathe you my warning.

The plot is quite sufficient, the dubbing and acting is decent, and the gore and make-up FX are great.  I absolutely loved the camera work, and the directing was good.  I've heard many comments about how this movie is a Dawn Of The Dead knockoff.  I just don't see much validity in this statement, or any of the negative statements I read, for that matter.  Sure Zombie is obviously influenced by DOTD, but it's in no way a knockoff!  Besides, I feel it is more closely related to Night of The Living Dead than Dawn anyway.  Bottom line, the zombies in this movie are brutal, it has a wonderful dark feel the whole way through, and I didn't get bored once!  Not once!  Or even shake my head at a supposedly ""crummy"" plot.  This movie is a work of dark art.  Did I mention it is suspenseful and the characters are likable too?!  Oh yeah, and the action sequences are good, and creepy!!!",976838400,4,1037,4.361256544502618

The spfx are very well-done, a great achievement considering the size of ZOMBIE's budget.  The titular creatures rate special kudos.  They easily equal Tom Savini's undead hordes in DAWN and are both chilling and sickening.  The story isn't that strong.  It's more or less an excuse to get the heroes onto the zombie infested Matool Island.  Don't let that keep you away.

From the begining scene in the morgue where, over a police officer with a torn out throat, one doctor asks the other, ""What do you think the cause of death was?"" to the final standoff where they have made an unlimited supply of molitov coctails from a few whiskey bottles.  The scene where one of the male characters takes a canoe paddle and smacks it against the wall causing the zombies to back off will forever live on in my Greatest B-Movie Moments Catalogue.

Dawn Of The Dead and Day Of The Dead are gorier films, but the effects in Zombie are better than Dawn, but not as good as Day.

I bought this film because the cover is cool and  I love horror films, especially zobie flicks.  This is easily one of the  most boring films that I've ever attempted to sit through.  The acting is  way too bad to have as much wordy dialoge as is present in this film.  Not  to mention the fact that there really isn't all that much gore.  The parts  that are gory are VERY gory, but with the abundance of horrible acting and  cheap special effects, who cares.  If you are looking for a really cool B  movie that is both gory and entertaining, then I suggest you get your hands  on one of the EVIL DEAD films.  I would have liked to have seen more  killing and zombies, and a lot less of the characters bad acting.  I am the  first to say that you should judge any kind of media for yourself.

Little do they know what their  headed for.  A crazed scientist who is obssessed with uncovering the secret  of the dead coming to life, a horrible plaque that's gotten the island's  inhabitants near death, and a voodoo witch doctor who is never seen and is  probably responsible for raising the dead.

So,it was a really hot,dark  evening with a thunderstorm threatening to knock the power out,and I was  really bored and regretting not buying Torso at the mall earlier, so I  pulled out my copy of Zombie and set out to watch it.  Lo and behold, I was  very entertained and managed to scare myself silly(storms and Italian  horror movies make a scary combination).  The beginning is somewhat slow,  but does a good job setting up the story.  There's a zombie here, a zombie  there,just enough to show you something's up.  By the time they get to the  island,though,things really start heating up.  All of a sudden,there's  zombies everywhere, and these aren't the shambling, blue-skinned ghouls of  Dawn of the Dead.  These are friggin nasty looking suckers.  They have  worms crawling through their eye sockets,and their flesh is all rotted and  hanging from their bodies.  Fulci got the throat-rippings right too, with  pulsing blood spurting all over the place.  The gore is absolutely  superb,especially for 1979, and makes Dawn(another film I was never fond  of) look like a sunday school picnic.  That said, many people will be bound  to hate this film.  Some will be bored, some will be nauseated, and some  will just laugh.  But it's still worth checking out, and if you hate it,  you can always scare your friends with it(I have a friend who is deathly  afraid of zombies;I already showed her Dawn and Children Shouldn't Play  With Dead Things,now this...hehe...fun...).

It has absolutely everything a great movie should have--naked women, gore, a splinter in the eye,  gut-munching, a carribean atmosphere, and apocalyptic doom, and Mia  Farrow's sister Tisa. The soundtrack is ultra-cool and creepy, too. This  movie is probably considered by most horror fans to be Fulci's best,  although The Beyond does frequently come in first place. What is for sure  is that Fulci has made a horror masterpiece that every fan should buy, not  rent, immediately.
Since I don't want to totally destroy the story for  you, let's just say that the zombies in question seem to have come about  due to some experiments by a curious doctor played by Richard Johnson. His  reasearch partner died and his daughter, played by Tisa Farrow, with a  reporter played by Ian McCulloch, go to this island in the Caribbean to  find out what's going on. A bad mistake. The zombies end up taking over the  whole island, which leads to a great scene in which Spanish conquistadores  wake up from the dead and open some throats the old-fashioned way. The end  of the movie is a standoff between those who are alive and those who are  dead.
I'm leaving much out, so get your mouse moving and put this tape in  your cart and proceed to the checkout. I realize that some people here have  very negative opinions of this film, but ignore them and give it a try. You  won't believe how atmospheric and gory this movie is!

Not  as action-packed or lovable as Dawn of the Dead, the film which undoubtedly  inspired the film's three producters Fabrizio De Angelis, Ugo Tucci, and  Gianfranco Couyoumdjian, but the film is much gorier and more mean-spirited  than most other films from the same time frame.  The vicious jungle setting  works well, and the nasty zombies that populate it really inspire a good  sense of dread and disgust.  The film certainly achieves what it set out  to.
Zombie actually out-grossed Dawn of the Dead with worldwide  box-office returns, allowing Fulvia Films and Gico Cinematografica to  produce several equally entertaining horror, sci-fi, and action films in  the 4-5 years afterward.  This is probably the film that helped out the  Italian film industry more than any other, including Hercules, Barbarella,  or Fistful of Dollars.
Fulci followed up Zombie with a slew his best  works; City of the Living Dead (NOT the same film as Gates of Hell Part 2:  Dead Awakening[which Fulci or anyone else in the film industry had nothing  to do with]), The House by the Cemetery, Conquest, The Smuggler, The New  York Ripper, and especially The Beyond.",958089600,,1370,5.058295964125561

Truth be told, I loved the zombies--they're some of the best I've seen in a film, and all done with good old fashioned makeup and atmosphere.
However, Fulci was a real hack in most departments.  The writing, acting, and even direction are downright cheesy in this flick, and the bad dubbing doesn't help.
But we do get some great gore, some great unnecessary nudity, and some cringe-worthy moments, most notably the wooden splinter through the eye scene, lovingly drawn out.  I do believe this DVD offered here is UNCUT, so we see that sequence in all of its gory glory!
The music is great as well--absolute Italian cheese from the 70s.  Which brings me to the genre in general.  A fascinating period in which the Italian government threw money at hacks and they all went out and splurged on the blood and guts.  And judging by this film, Maniac, New York Ripper, Cannibal Holocaust, etc., etc., the New York Mayor's office must have needed some serious cash or friends because they'd let anyone film in the city.

The zombies, themselves, are also portrayed  straightforwardly. Unlike a Romero film, you won't find any comical  personality traits among the walking dead. They are all as cold as the  ground they rise up from. The film also benefits from an extraordinary use  of lighting, sound, and music. Granted, it DOES have its slow spots.

I have  found a couple of fun bloopers in the film. One is that during the shark  scene, the zombie blows out bubbles! Another is that in a tropical island  such as Matool, a corpse buried in a shallow grave would rot to liquid over  about a year. Yet over a hundred years later, the conquistador zombies rise  again! But what the hell. It is well acted, you get into the story, and  what a grand finale!

Expect state-of-the-art special effects (which honestly rival some of what you'll see in today's film market), an awesome battle between a zombie and a real live shark, and ancient Spanish conquistador zombies rising unexpectedly from the jungle ground to devour the living.",935280000,5,562,5.043010752688172
934484,1,6304819927,I am a young teen girl and I found this movie histerical. The effects were horrible. I was flabergasted at the women taking their tops off for no reason. I don't think that added to the film. The underwater Zombie vs.  shark scene wasn't what it was made out to be.. it was about 1 minute long  and it was so fake. The zombie's BRIGHT green blood ruined it. This film  was a discrace to all Zombie films - if you want to see a great zombie  movie see Dawn of the Dead or day of the Dead.. thank you.,933552000,4,499,3.96

This is the single greatest zombie movie ever made! The plot is fast moving and the action scenes are never too far apart. The gore is second to none and the zombies are the best ever seen on the silver  screen. Some memorable moments include the zombie/shark battle and the eye  piercing sliver! While it stands alone as a great movie it could be seen as  the perfect explanation for the happenings in Romero's Dead Trilogy. Simple  genius.",923529600,,459,4.62962962962963
934486,5,6304819927,"The late Lucio Fulci may have made plenty of films, but he will always be remembered by his fans as the ""godfather of gore"". His films may be badly paced and clunky at times, but he will always step in with a show  stopping special effect to jolt you back to full attention. The highlight  of this film has to be the infamous splinter in the eyeball scene. Fulci  and FX man De Rossi love eyeball violence, and this features heavily in  their films. If you like this, check out Fulci's ""The Beyond"",  ""New York Ripper"", or ""Gates of Hell"". Don't expect  Hollywood budgets, but do expect shocking violence and gore.
