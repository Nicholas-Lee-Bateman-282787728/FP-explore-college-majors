5957689,4,B00EZ22926,So this is he official close the abruptly ended Kokoro Connect anime. If you have not seen the series GO WATCH THAT before you attempt to watch this as you will have the rest ruined for you. If you have seen and enjoyed the series then you should enjoy seeing the conclusion to the series and get closure on this bizarre love triangle.,1395619200,2,335,4.333333333333333
5957690,4,B00EZ22926,"Kokoro Connect (as a whole) is a very good anime.  You are following 5 students who have been chosen (seemingly for no real reason other than they seemed interesting) to be tormented by some all-powerful being who wants some cheap entertainment.  The 5 main characters end up going through a variety of experiences.  Through it all, they learn a lot about one another that they otherwise would probably never have known.

The OVA is essentially the last 4 episodes of this show and while they could make more (I sure hope they do) I think these OVA's leave off at a good stopping point.  I only have one minor ""gripe"" which keeps me from giving this 5 stars.  If you saw this show in ""sub"" then you know that the end scene where Inabe and Tiechi are in the nurses office is really one of the shows highlights.  The Dub (in my opinion) is not as good as the Sub was in capturing the difference between what is spoken and what is thought.  However, that is my only issue.  Otherwise, Kokoro connect is worth the money.",1389571200,7,1016,4.419354838709677
5957691,4,B00EZ22926,I really liked Kokoro Connect and these 4 extra OVA episode give you more it conrinues the story and let's you see the characters in a different light.,1388448000,,151,4.428571428571429

8610523,4,B00EZ22926,"Overall, the show was good. They call this an OVA, but it is not your typical OVA. Usually OVA go off of the show, but have their own thing going on. This on the other hand, is just the end of the show. For some reason, they put the last 4 episodes out as an OVA instead of combining them in with the season. They even advertised that these shows were there, because in the last episode of the regular season, they had a preview for the next episode.

These episodes go right along with the show, and have the same quality of entertainment. Like I said, it does not even seem like an OVA. They had a decent ending that did not leave you feeling like there was going to be more.. But still left it open so they could make another season if they wanted to.

Overall, the whole show (the season and OVA) were good. What it is about is this ""god like"" being, does things to them to get them to grow up a little, be honest with themselves, and their feeling, etc. They do different things like, switching bodies, being able to read others thoughts, and even change into kids at times. Depending on the situation, different things happened.. and it was all at random times.. But, it all stayed within their group. It was an entertaining show.. Not one I would want to watch over and over.. But still entertaining..",1515196800,,1308,4.313008130081301
8610524,5,B00EZ22926,Terrific anime.  This OVA that. Obtains episodes 13-17 are a must have to really bring a conclusion to the series.,1469404800,2,114,4.7

Both the TV Collection and the OVA Package of Kokoro Connect are regions A and B.",1429574400,,151,4.241379310344827
8610528,3,B00EZ22926,"kokoro connect is a wonderful anime series worthy of a 5 star rating.
 Unfortunately it annoys me to no end  that section 23/ Sentai film works chose to sell this ova separately, as these
4 episodes are essential to giving kokoro connect an actual  ending.",1418688000,4,256,4.644444444444445
8610529,5,B00EZ22926,I've really enjoyed this series. I first heard about it on an anime website and was reluctant to start watching another body swapping harem story but this one took a few twists and turns I didn't expect. It's funny and thoughtful. I highly recommend the first season and the OVA. I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself happily involved.,1400284800,4,334,4.775862068965517
