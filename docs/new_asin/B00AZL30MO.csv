8559674,3,B00AZL30MO,"The film was interesting, but mostly compiled from bits and pieces shot by locals and lacking integration. Needs to replace much of that with some overview material on how long power was out, the extent of apartment and office building basement flooding and the results that created, the extent of damage to the subway system, now far into the city the flooding extended, and the efforts to mitigate future such storms.",1376611200,,419,4.915492957746479
8559675,3,B00AZL30MO,"This DVD Superstorm 2012 is about Hurricane Sandy which struck the eastern seaboard of the US in October 2012.  The DVD has many good qualities but there are some aspects of the presentation that I didn't care for.

The DVD provides an overview of the storm and mostly fixates on the New York and New Jersey area.  There are film clips from the event while in progress, interviews with rescue personnel, interviews with meteorologists, and many shots of the aftermath. You will definitely get a good view of the damage done by the storm.

On the down side I didn't always care for how it was presented. There tended to be numerous, quick film clips on various events that are shown one after another. You'll see falling trees, flooding streets, police and fireman rushing to some scene, and then film clips of the storm-tossed ocean.  It's a bit jarring to watch. There are also some re-enactments of a 911 call center viewing Twitter messages at the height of the storm (I dislike re-enactments).

In some scenes they interviewed residents whose homes were destroyed by the storm. It was heartbreaking to watch, but it wasn't always clear exactly where they lived or if everyone they knew died in the storm. And I don't recall any information about the number of casualties caused by Sandy.

The storm's origins were mostly discussed near the end of the documentary, which focused more on the climate change issue than this particular storm. And I noticed they showed the same graphics of the storm on a weather map over-and-over again.  With so much other information to cover, why s repeat anything?

Overall it was an interesting documentary but seems like a project rushed into production. I wouldn't doubt if others like it more than I did, but I think a storm as devastating as Sandy needs a better-produced documentary than one that focuses on dramatic images and a scattershot presentation of facts.",1370217600,2,1908,4.828220858895706
