5636262,2,B00BKUO438,I am a huge Bon Jovi fan but wish I would of never bought this DVD. It's horrible. The interviews  go from one thing to another interview and doesnt make much sense in the way they put it together. Plus the sound is horrible and i had to turn up the volume high just to hear what they are talking about. The band would be very disappointed in this dvd. Dont waste your money!,1370995200,3,375,4.0675675675675675
5636263,5,B00BKUO438,Just got it when i got home from being away so i have not  seen or heard it but anything pertaining to BJ or Jon is great !,1368316800,3,123,3.392857142857143
5636264,3,B00BKUO438,"Most of material has been shown on VH1, so nothing much new. Wouldn't waste money on this if I had it to do again. If you just want JBJ eye candy then its worth the $.",1368144000,3,167,3.6666666666666665

8570028,5,B00BKUO438,"As a Bon Jovi fan for over 30 some years, I thoroughly enjoyed this !  I can never get enough of Jon, Tico, David and their concerts, apparel, books, CD s etc.  While Richie Sambora has chosen to move on, he is missed and I felt that Jon took the high when explaining what had happened.  So Looking forward to their newest CD release in November 2016 & the tour to come !  If you're a Bon Jovi fanatic, this is for you !!",1464134400,,421,3.9761904761904763

8570030,3,B00BKUO438,This dvd set was just ok. The first dvd is barely audible. Some of it was pretty boring. The second dvd is better and I enjoyed watching it for the most part.,1427328000,,158,3.96875
8570031,3,B00BKUO438,"The disc with all of the band's interviews is sooo great, fun and funny. The band at ease just being themselves truly enjoyable. I watch it over and over again!!  Well worth  buying it. The second disc with the men speaking about Bon Jovi was boring and too full of opinions. The Englishmen , Malcom Dome,  who claims he's the bands Official Biographer is a major A-hole!  This disc does have one good thing, it's the 25 question quiz about Bon Jovi. I found about a lot of info I didn't know about the band!  It  was fun to test my knowledge.  I learned from the quiz.",1411430400,6,569,4.261682242990654

8570033,5,B00BKUO438,It is exactly what I expected and it is a great insight from the beginnings of such a wonderful band,1393113600,6,100,4.05
8570034,5,B00BKUO438,I have to admit I'm not the biggest Jovi fan in the world but purchased this double DVD set for my son at Christmas and the family watched it together on Boxing Day. We were all pleasantly surprised at both the quality of the two separate films included here and of how Jon Bon Jovi appears to be such a decent and honourable person through numerous interviews included in the set. Personally I wasn't previously aware of what a truly intelligent and caring man Jon is but after watching this documentary set am now a major fan of JBJ. This product is highly recommended.,1388448000,7,571,4.5
8570035,2,B00BKUO438,all this is interviews.  there is very little music or any concert video.  It got quite boring after a little while.  I thought the interview with the PBS guy was the best part by far,1384905600,,183,4.171428571428572
8570036,5,B00BKUO438,"This double DVD set is really good news for big BJ fans showing as it does both the band in an interview setting and at work and in performance. Covers their whole career, however the second film does concentrate more on the9r later period post new millennium. Worth getting and worth the money",1377129600,8,294,4.566037735849057
