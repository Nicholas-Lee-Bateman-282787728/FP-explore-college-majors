2861865,5,B000R7I3YG,This show is hilarious! I love Tom Hanks and this is a classic. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good laugh!,1324252800,,122,4.125
2861866,5,B000R7I3YG,This is the real early Tom Hanks making his fans laugh with Peter Scolari as his crazy friend who make all the women in their life join in on the fun in the all women hotel.,1241654400,,173,3.8333333333333335
2861867,5,B000R7I3YG,"I really enjoyed this show as a kid and watching the shows over again...I still laugh. Tom and Peter did an awesome job and really pulled off the female look! If you're a Bosom Fan, you'll want this collection. Bummer that it was only 2 seasons!",1225152000,4,245,4.3478260869565215
2861868,5,B000R7I3YG,"The opening narratives from the show are very much on the DVDs.  I was puting off buying the set because of what Lu had commented, but finally broke down and did purchase the complete series.  I'm glad I did.  I still haven't seen all the episodes and know that there are some changes, but still enjoyable.  And, yes...the opening narratives start on the episode ""How Great Thou Art.""  I believe that when it aired on the ABC-TV network, they had the producers start that intro earlier, but that this is the real master.
Also, yes I do miss the Billy Joel theme, but the theme used is the really the original theme to Bosom Buddies that was replaced last minute.  If you notice the narrative instrumental music matched this theme song and also matches the end theme.  It was also the theme that was used when they aired repeats on The USA Cable Network.",1207180800,34,853,4.5
2861869,2,B000R7I3YG,"I've loved Bosom Buddies since the instant it was first broadcast in 1981, and was overjoyed to discover the show was finally out on DVD. However, this package is highly disappointing, almost to the point that I considered returning it. Not only is the original opening music gone, but so is the narrative which explained the premise of the show. Pieces of dialogue, and in some cases entire scenes, are missing. The packaging is spare ... OK, it's cheap ... and there is no bonus anything.

Frankly, the occasional reruns on TBS are better than this DVD set.",1201564800,21,559,4.704081632653061
2861870,4,B000R7I3YG,"Sure, the storyline had been done before in ""Some Like it Hot"", but I really loved this show. The obvious reason for looking back on it now is to see Tom Hanks ""back in the day"" before he hit the big screen. After all, he was the only actor besides Spencer Tracy to ever win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars. Wouldn't you be curious if we had 40 or so half-hour episodes of Spence as a young man parading around in a dress in a situation comedy? I know I would. Besides Tom Hanks, the other castmembers were terrific, and most had pretty good careers. Peter Scolari (Henry Desmond) had a long run on ""Newhart"" in the 80's, Donna Dixon (Sonny Lumet) was adequate enough as Hank's love interest on the show, the late Wendy Jo Sperber (Amy Cassidy) was very good as the overweight girl who hoped against hope that Scolari's character would come to love her, and then there's the early appearance of Telma Hopkins (Isabelle Hammond) who had other comedic roles on ""Gimme A Break"" and then ""Family Matters"". Holland Taylor as Ruth Dunbar rounds out the cast as Kip and Henry's boss in the first season and partner in the second one. She's part foil and part friend to the leading duo at a time (the early 80's) before the boomers had aged to the point where they would admit that there was such a thing as a beautiful older woman, which she was.

The show lost some of its appeal when the women found out that Buffy and Hildy were really Kip and Henry, but then the ruse couldn't have gone on for another entire season without the show losing even more appeal. Things were kept pretty interesting in the second season though by changing scenery - Kip and Henry buy their own ad agency - and by Kip blowing it in the worst way by cheating on Sonny. Sonny's response to finding out is not what Kip expected - she's OK with it for all the wrong reasons. It turns out she was never that sure of their relationship and she felt her lack of a reaction just proved she wasn't ready for an exclusive arrangement after all. The show lasted for only about 40 episodes, so it never really got a chance to really wear out its welcome. I'd recommend it for its inventive light comedy and all of the careers that it unexpectedly launched.",1188345600,20,2217,4.394160583941606
2861871,5,B000R7I3YG,"This show is hilarious. Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari make a great comedic team. This show is not a social commentary on sexual orientation, it is a funny look at what would happen if two men had to dress up as women to have a place to live. The way they make fun of themselves and their situation is funny. The supporting characters are great too. The fact that these two men could in no way pass for real women is part of the humor. I loved it!",1187568000,25,444,4.056818181818182
2861872,5,B000R7I3YG,Love this old series.  I remember watching this as a teenager. Great entertainment.  Recommend to all.,1518566400,,102,5.3125
2861873,5,B000R7I3YG,"It's been 37 years since this show first appeared and we were presented with the acting abilities of two young men beginning their careers. Peter Scolari would go on to more TV work in series like HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS and NEWHART. The other actor you may have heard of starring in more big screen movies. His name was Tom Hanks.

BOSOM BUDDIES told the story of Kip Wilson (Hanks) and best friend Henry Desmond, two young men with dreams of making it as an artist and writer respectively, who work at an ad agency. When the building they're living in is demolished they look for somewhere else to stay. Agency secretary Amy (Wendie Jo Sperber), who openly longs for Henry, offers them a place for the weekend staying at her apartment. What she fails to mention is the fact that she lives in an all woman's apartment building. In an effort to ""skirt"" the regulations Kip and Henry borrow some ladies clothing from their workplace and waltz into the apartment complex as Buffy and Hildegard, sisters to Kip and Henry. When they realize how nice and affordable the place is they decide to make it more permanent and rent the room across the hall from Amy.

Making the place all the more attractive is the fact that Amy's roommate is Sonny (Donna Dixon), a beautiful blonde that Kip immediately falls in love with. Of course this leads to all sorts of shenanigans as Kip tries to woo Sonny while his alter ego Buffy continues to tell Sonny all about how wonderful a catch her ""brother"" is.

The series was successful enough to garner two full seasons and as a fan I never understood why it disappeared. Reading about it now it seems the ratings just weren't there for the show. Then again when you discover the same thing about a series like CHEERS it makes you wonder why TV executives don't to more to promote their shows and give them a bigger opportunity. The fact that the series has developed a bit of a cult following shows that it could have gone on longer.

The biggest attraction of the series was the quirky nature of the comedy involved here. Hanks and Scolari play well off one another and it's easy to see, more so when you read about it, that there are many improvisational items in the series that made it one of the funniest things on TV at the time. Watching it all these years later it is still hilarious and enjoyable.

But there is something else interesting to note here. There is no way possible this series could be made in now. The timing of this release, completely unintentional, rides on the coat tails of the #metoo movement and many items in the show would simply not fly in today's politically correct atmosphere. They are harmless and often revolve around the natural attraction between men and women. In fact much of the time when either Kip or Henry act like lecherous males it's to their detriment. And by living lives as women part time they discover the other side of the coin.

One episode does a great job of looking at how men look at women as mere meat rather than as entire entities. A night out in drag they're looked over by the men at a local singles bar causing Henry to get angry that the men don't find them attractive enough to bother to ask them to dance. His outrage becomes vocal as Kip tries to remind him that their NOT women and that it's probably in their best interest not to have men attracted to them. Later on Henry realizes that while he was angry at the treatment he received he's been doing the same thing with Amy for some time.

There are a number of jokes in the show that are hilarious and yet would cause the latest social warrior to demand a safe space to recover from being forced to listen to them. But the fact remains that comedy is supposed to make us uncomfortable at times, it's supposed to make us think and consider all there is around us. BOSOM BUDDIES did just that with each episode and made us laugh at the same time. It shows what is lacking in most comedies today, a sense of what is right without trying to shove it down your throat while watching. This more subtle approach unites rather than divides, never taking sides like many of today's comedies do. In the end it will make this the better series to remember and be enjoyed and will reach a larger audience.

The single seasons have been released in the past but CBS Home Entertainment is releasing it now in the complete series format in a single box that will most likely take up less shelf space and keep it all together in one spot. If you've never seen the show then by all means pick this one up. You'll find yourself laughing start to finish and in addition to that get exposed to the crazy antics of Hanks in a very different light than seen in recent years. He's become such a great actor and while that's apparent here he's more inclined to remind you of Robin Williams than the star he is today. Pick up a copy and see why.",1518480000,,4874,4.419821826280623

This 1980-82 sitcom also used the song ""My Life ""by Billy Joel for BOSOM BUDDIES theme song as well making Billy Joel's song an even bigger hit back in the early 80's.

This 1980-81 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when Ronald Regan was president and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had from 1981-1982.

It is zero entertainment. Not even funny. Just dumb. The only thing I got out of this was seeing a very pretty Donna Dixon long before I saw in her in Moonlighting episode, a young Holland Taylor that I like is almost anything she plays in, and Wendy Jo Sperber (who had so much talent to go no where).

2861946,4,B000R7I3YG,"BOSOM BUDDIES: Woefully short lived (only 37 episodes) and underappreciated, this fast paced sitcom starred future film superstar TOM HANKS and future NEWHART regular PETER SCOLARI, who played KIP WILSON and HENRY DESMOND, a ""Mutt and Jeff"" team of the highest comedic order. The kooky cast included their snarky ad exec boss RUTH DUNBAR (HOLLAND TAYLOR), statuesque blonde/object of KIP's affections SONNY, (DONNA DIXON), former TONY ORLANDO & DAWN singer TELMA HOPKINS as sassy ISABELLE and the wonderful WENDY JO SPERBER as plus-sized, HENRY-hungry AMY CASSIDY. Forced to assume their sibling alter egos BUFFY and HILDEGARD in order to live in the Susan B. Anthony hotel for women, KIP and HENRY were like LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and LENNY & SQUIGGY all rolled up into one. Reveling in endless pop culture references, groan-worthy puns, inevitable wardrobe malfunctions and genuinely funny slapstick on behalf of the two immensely likable stars, BOSOM BUDDIES virtually defined ""must-see TV"" in the early eighties.

2861947,5,B000R7I3YG,"If you want to recall the clothes, cars, hair from a generation ago and see Tom Hanks before he became the mega star he is today, Bosom Buddies is a light, funny comedy that will do the trick.",1401926400,,192,4.078947368421052

I ordered the series and it came quickly and in perfect condition. Fantastic product and a fantastic experience. It is just too bad that they replaced the original theme song, but that is outside the control of the provider. That would have made it all perfect.",1382313600,4,338,4.540983606557377

When I started to watch it, I realized why I didn't watch it much....just like Three's Company, The Ropers and others.  Bad writing.  Just not funny.  I mean, it's ok.  I loved the late Wendie Jo Sperber in this show and have followed her career.  Peter Scolari is eh, ok as an actor.  I never saw any greatness in him.  Tom Hanks is great and I have seen everything he has done.  But this show was dull and made Peter and Tom look dull.

2861953,4,B000R7I3YG,"I recently purchased this series for my wife -- when we first met fresh out of college in the mid-'80s, one reason we knew we were meant for each other was our shared love of this under-appreciated series.

The production value of this show was pretty low and, presumably, typical for the era. But talent is talent, and what made this show work was the total commitment, chemistry and comedic timing of the cast and especially, of course, the two leads, Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari. You can already see Hanks' charisma and his gift to make any line reading funny, while keeping it rooted in character. In re-watching the show, it's surprising at how much heart it had amidst all the silliness.

At the end of the day, the show holds up because of the leads and the opportunity to see Tom Hanks (and Peter Scolari)at the start of their careers but clearly already gifted and destined for greater things. This was underscored by the fact that other comedians enjoyed and respected the show (I recall once reading an interview with Carl Reiner at the time, mentioning this show as a favorite).

It says much that Hanks and Scolari have remained friends, with Scolari occasionally showing up in Hanks' projects.

One caveat: The original theme song was a cover of Billy Joel's ""My Life."" Due to licensing reasons, the theme song is not used on the DVD (nor on reruns). This is a shame and, I must admit, detracts much from this DVD release. The song used for the DVD apparently is the end theme with lyrics, but it's pretty awful, bland, and unlistenable. I just skip the opening credits.",1376524800,24,1584,4.6263345195729535
2861954,3,B000R7I3YG,I'm a fan of Tom Hanks.  Thanks goodness his projects today have a much larger budget as well as amazing costars.  It is a cheesy sitcom from all those years ago with some likable characters.,1373328000,2,191,4.428571428571429

8199388,4,B000R7I3YG,"This vintage sitcom (and its disconcerting that something that aired when I was merely 30 is considered vintage) might be termed a guilty pleasure except that Ive never kept secret my fondness for it and I don't feel the slightest bit guilty. It involves two advertising guys, Kip and Henry (Tom Hanks, way early in his career, and Peter Scolari), whose apartment building falls to a wrecking ball; their only option for a cheap apartment found quickly is in the Susan B. Anthony hotel for women only. So of course they disguise themselves as their sisters to obtain the digs. Of course. Kip falls for a lovely dancer (Donna Dixon) whos a fellow (sorry) resident while the ad agencys receptionist (the late and lamented Wendy Jo Sperber), who is in on the ruse, has a not so secret crush on Henry. Rampant silliness is the hallmark of the series (and Hanks and Scolari reportedly did a great deal of ad-libbing and improvisation during rehearsals and taping) but the show could also be surprisingly deep as it addressed gender issues and the tendency to value physical attractiveness over other qualities. There is also some gentle ribbing of the advertising business.
 Now this isn't Chekhov by any means. The goofiness is balanced with sober and sobering content. Possibly the most such comes in a second year flashback to Kips and Henrys high schooldays when he lies that hes not attending the prom to a mute young woman who invites him only to then encounter her at the dance. In present day he encounters her again at a class reunion. In a first season episode the boys dragon lady boss Ruth Dunbar (the incomparable Holland Taylor), who is domineering, conniving and sexually voracious, holds a manic celebratory dinner party for Henry and Kip. They bolt early and in their absence we see what a lonely woman she really is. The show has not aged particularly well. There is too much reliance on topical references that those under a certain age will not understand (if you don't get a punchline such as Wouldnt you like to be a pepper, too? you're not in the right range). On the other hand the chemistry between Hanks and Scolari (whose career has sadly not been as high profile as his co-stars) remains fresh and frankly astonishing; youd think these two had been working together for years. They are supported by a terrific all-female cast (talk about progressive). Dixon may have little to do beyond being the Marilyn Monroe surrogate (right down to the breathy voice) but Sperber, Holland, Telma Hopkins (late of Dawn and given several chances to demonstrate her considerable vocal abilities) and Lucille Benson are as adept at mining comic gold as the stars.",1520726400,,2670,4.816993464052287

8199392,3,B000R7I3YG,"Unfortunately, those of us hoping for something different from the prior release, we get a goose egg!  We don't get the original ""My Life"" theme song which I was sure was one of the reasons for the re-release. There has been absolutely no remaster in picture or sound. It appears to me that this release is just a more sleek repackaging.
The new packaging is the only plus here. Instead of two separate complete seasons strapped together, this new release is an actual box set with new artwork. I am giving three stars for the rarity of the show and the awesomeness of it plus the compact box set packaging.  I don't recommend re-buying if you have the original first two seasons on DVD, as you are mainly paying again for different packaging.",1518739200,,743,4.578947368421052
