8469924,3,B005FHVND6,"Not good but not that bad - the story is a good one but the movie tends to drag.
Only a couple of recognizable faces. Sadly the pace of the movie put me to sleep like a late night movie should.
It's not a boring movie it needs a good kicker, maybe music or a better sound guy. The love scenes are tv tame.",1495497600,,305,3.78125
8469925,2,B005FHVND6,"2010 (not 2016)  standard noir with added psycho surrealistic dream filler material. Some surprises, okay nudity in the context of seduction, art modeling. A little bizarre. Pretty bad acting, good cinematography.",1479945600,,213,5.870967741935484
8469926,5,B005FHVND6,"Twists and turns.
Lots of fun.
Great performances all around, and Robert Davi, Steven Bauer & James Russo are such a great addition to this little Neo-Noir.
Check this out, you won't be disappointed.",1395792000,,199,4.882352941176471
8469927,1,B005FHVND6,"(1.) Cheesy acting and script. The dialogue sounded like it came from a high school drama class project. Quality acting credits? As is typical in these movies it is nearly invisible. Lots of TV videos, shorts or such movie classics as ""She Alien"", ""Savage Island"", ""Return of the Killer Shrews"", ""Pimp Bulies"", ""Swamp Shark"".
(2.) Creating a lot of confusing, is it a dream or is it real, subplots only works with a quality script, plot and acting otherwise it's just arrogant look at clever me, ""I can confuse you."" writing and directing.
(3.) Storyline: Some homeless guy bumps his shopping cart into some wealthy chick's shopping cart in the middle of a mostly empty parking lot. ""Whoops, sorry, I didn't see you. How clumsy of me."" Within the next 10 minutes he's recruited to come live with her and her husband and, oh, also kill him. But she doesn't know that the husband hired him as a cheap private eye to check on her. To make this a love quadrangle, is another boyfriend, who has been recruited by the wife to steal her husband's prized painting and sell it to some accent laden crook in a warehouse for 5 million - sure! Private eye shoots all the people involved in the painting heist, steals the money, and for some bizarre reason decides to just put one bullet into the gun afterwards, then spins the chamber and walks around in broad daylight and the rest of the movie like it's fully loaded. Does not make sense storytelling, does not equate with good storytelling. The final result is, quite implausibly, the wife lives and private eye dies. Anybody else that appeared in the movie is just forgotten about.",1321142400,,1623,4.658536585365853
8469928,5,B005FHVND6,"This is a quirky detective style movie. It is a dark comedy with plenty of twists and flashbacks. Katrina (sexy, seductive Katherine Randolph) bumps into an artist, Mickey Lewis (Steven Man) in a parking lot. She hires him to paint her (and her rich husband's) house while living in the pool house. They have an affair.

Example of the film with the early plot SPOILER/twist: The husband leaves town, his expensive painting is stolen. Mickey goes to the warehouse where the exchange is being made. He kills the Russians and the man who stole the painting and grabs a brief case full of money (It is supposed to be $5 million dollars, but that amount of money in $100 bills would weigh 110 pounds). He returns to find Katrina tied up, spread eagle on the bed. He unties her and offers to share the money with her and she pulls a gun on him. Mickey is not phased at all as he explains he has the room bugged (shows her a bugging device) and claims he was hired by her husband to spy on her. Then the  movie gets weirder with more twists.

Plenty of quirky characters. Fun movie. Every time I thought I had it figured out, it twisted.

F-bomb, nudity, sex.",1313884800,4,1153,4.39906103286385
