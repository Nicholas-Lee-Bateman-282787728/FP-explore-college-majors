Y2J/CLB vs. Trish/Lita- Way to make the guys look weak!  This wasn't a good match, and it's only purpose was to further the Y2J/Trish/Christian angle.  2/5

Batista vs. HBK- Good match.  Batista's first good match.  HBK can make anyone look good.  HBK needed a win and he got it.  Batista still comes off looking good later...  4/5

HHH vs. Goldberg vs. Kane- I liked this match.  Not the best triple threat match, but still good.  All three looked good here.  HHH wins the title.  Evolution has all the gold.  4/5

Match One-Booker T Vs Mark Henry-This was a back and forth match which was a good choice for the opener, it had a bit of interference by Theodore Long. Mark Henry is a useless wrestler and shouldn't be here. Booker deserves a lot better then this. Hopefull this is the end of this feud as it was a clean ending. Lots of near falls making this a lot better then you'd think. My rating 6/10.

Match Two-Intercontinental Championship-Special Referee-Mick Foley-RVD(C)Vs Randy Orton-Good match with lots of near falls and action. Foley as ref added just a bit of spice with the future possibility of him vs Randy which would be very good. Randy did a lot of dominating RVD in this match and it was good cocky heel tactics. This was one of the better matches on the card. Hopefully they do this match again down the track with maybe a gimmick match. Very surprise ending which I liked. My rating 7.4/10.

Match Three-Battle Of The Sexes-Trish Stratus & Lita VS Y2J & Christian-First things first why the hell weren't Y2J & Christian put into the tag turmoil match instead of this garbage. This match was poor quality but what can you expect? This whole match absolutely sucked especially the ending which meands this will continue but hopefully this ends it with Trish and Y2J being back together and Matt Hardy returning to gain Lita again. Please WWE give us some matches we can care about. My rating 0/10.

Match Four-Batista Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels-This all started at Survivor Series when Batista screwed HBK out of saving Austins career. This had the quickness and experience of HBK versing the power of Batista. Batista returned a bit over a month earlier and has rampaged through everyone. Lots of work done on HBK's back in this match. Great ending in this match with a couple of finisher counters in it. My rating 6.25/10.

Match Five-Matt Hardy Vs Maven-Batista was in a foul mood and killed Maven then Matt jumped in the ring and counted a three count for himself and announced himself winner. Killed possibility of a good match. My rating 1/10.

Match Six-Tag Team Turmoil Match-Tag Team Titles-Dudley Boyz(C)Vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade Vs Val Venis & Lance Storm Vs The Hurricane & Rosey Vs La Resistance Vs Test & Scott Steiner-What do you do with lots of misfit wrestlers and many great tag teams? You put them in a tag team turmoil match. This had many good teams and it was solidly built. There are many upsets and surprises in this match especially the ending is a good surprise. So sit back and enjoy many styles of tag team wrestling. My rating 6.35/10.

Match Seven-Womens Championship-Molly Holly(C)Vs Ivory-This was announced on the show. The returning Ivory may be a good wrestler but this just wasn't a good match. My rating 3/10.

Match Eight-Main Event-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH Vs Kane Vs Goldberg(C)-This was an average triple threat match. It was nowhere as good as past triple threat matches and it was a little weird the style. The finish was a little screwed but it still was alright. Hopefully this feud is over once and for all. My rating 7/10.

This show received 370 out of 800 which is 46.25% which is equivelant to a C-. This was an average PPV to end this year on. Hopefully there's better next year.",1119225600,5,3765,4.7953125
1891693,3,B00009W0VY,"1. Booker T vs. Mark Henry

It was a good choice for a opener. This was the average big man vs.little man match. The only problem with this was that it was to long IMO. Also Teddy Long (Henry's manager) didn't do any heelish stuff in this match like distracting the ref. Booker T did all he could to overcome the 350 pound giant and he did. Booker T wins after 2 Sisscors Kicks. 8/10

2. Intercontinential Championship

Randy Orton vs. Rob Van Dam

The match actually started as a promo with Mick Foley and Stacy Kiebler. Then Orton along with Ric Flair came out and basically told Foley(who was the guest ref of the match) to start the match-up. I think this was the match of the night. Orton was at his best while RVD wasn't to sharp, he only got in a few kicks. Some spots were boring because Orton applied the headlock to many times. My only problem with this match was the Orton was in control for most of the match. Orton win with a RKO out of nowhere. 8.5/10

3. Chris Jericho/Christian vs. Trish Stratus/Lita

I don't why everyone hated this match this was actually good. The ladies did their absolute best against Y2J and CLB, hell they even embarressed them a couple times. Jericho was tring to be the peacemaker in this match tring to aplogize to Trish but she would have none of it. As expected, Y2J and CLB win. 8/10

4. Batista vs. Shawn Micheals

This was a okay match. Like the first match, it was a typical big man vs.small man match. The contest went back and forth. At one point I thought Batista was going to pull an upset after he hit Micheals with two spinebusters in a row. But Micheal shook it off and countered The Powerbomb with a SCM and wins. 7.5/10

5. Matt Hardy vs. Maven

This technically wasn't the match because both wrestlers were scared to enter the ring cause Batista was still whining about his loss to Micheals. The Hardy threw Maven into the ring to get demolished by Batista. After he left, Hardy counted himself a pinfall. What a waste of time. 5/10

6. Tag Team Termoil

This was another okay match. It started off slow but then picked up after The Dudley Boyz entered the contest. But then it got boring again when Scott Stiener and Test entered the ring. Then when the Dudleyz thought they retained their titles, Eric Bischoff come out and announces the team of Ric Flair and Batista. They litterily won the titles in like 2-3 minutes. 7.5/10

7. Women's Chamionship

Ivory vs. Molly Holly

Skipable just a match filler.

8. World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H vs. Kane vs. Goldberg

I was really looking foward to this match. Three of the biggest stars on Raw go at it for the World Heavyweight Championship. But as I saw the match I was dissapointed. This was basiclly a handicap match with both Kane and Triple H teaming up on Goldberg. Kane was still beating up Goldberg and Triple H hit him with a chair WTF!? Triple H wins after he low blows Goldberg and Kane chokeslamms him, and is pulled away by Batista. 8/10

This was overall a average PPV. Half of the matches were average and dissapointing. But if your're a Evolution fan buy this PPV cause they win all the titles here.",1117411200,2,3133,4.43630017452007

BOOKER T defeated MARK HENRY: Nothing earth-shattering here. Exactly what we all expected. Average match. Sloppy match. It probably lasted longer than I thought it would (9 minutes), although so it should when a card is advertised to have all of 6 matches. It could have been worse, I suppose!!! Booker tried hard, but even he seems to lack any motivation nowadays. Being put in a feud with Henry will probably do that to you. Terrible choice for opener, as the crowd were even less motivated than Booker T, by the sound of it. Match Rating...4

RANDY ORTON defeated ROB VAN DAM to Win the InterContinental Title: No joke, I only found this match hard to rate, because the rest of the card was so mediocre. This was the match of the night in my opinion, but I don't want to over-rate it by comparing it to the rest of the matches. It was 19 minutes of good psychological wrestling where both men impressed by using their strengths. The only fact that let it down was the usual Orton restholds that plague his matches. He controlled far too much of the offense, and there was not enough back & forth action taking place to really keep everyone on the edge of their seats. Having said that, Orton took a step up with new moves, and a decent variety of offense, while RVD proved that he doesn't need to be carried & can space out his spots effectively in a longer match. The abrupt ending probably didn't help the match out though. Match Rating...7

CHRIS JERICHO & CHRISTIAN defeated LITA & TRISH STRATUS: I really feared, not only for the quality of this match, but also for what the WWE would book to occur during it. I was pleasantly surprised though, as the 9 minute bout was booked & performed as well as it possibly could have been. Still not exactly what I really want to see during a pay-per-view, but all 4 involved should be given plaudits for the way they conducted themselves, both from a wrestling & entertainment perspective. Parts of the match livened up the crowd, while the door is kept open on the angle which could possibly lead to a Chris Jericho face turn. Match Rating...5

SHAWN MICHAELS defeated BATISTA: Shawn Michaels has done nothing but amaze me this year (see '2003 Awards' below), and he really did try his hardest to get something decent out of Batista here. Unfortunately though, this was probably his most ho-hum match this year. It wasn't terrible, but you could tell that even HBK was struggling to drag anything spectacular out of Batista in the 12 minutes that this bout was given. Maybe I have over-rated Batista a little. Match Rating...6

RIC FLAIR & BATISTA won the Tag-Team Turmoil Match to Win the World Tag-Team Titles: Here was another way of how not to book a match & a division. Firstly, unpredictability was thrown out the window when in a backstage segment before this match, Flair told Batista to remain in the building so that they could have titles around their waists. About 18 minutes of nothing much really happened all leading to the inevitable Flair & Batista ""surprise"". No team was really pushed in this match, while some teams like La Resistance & Hurricane/Rosey came out looking terrible from it. This was an interesting idea ruined, just so Evolution can brag about having all the titles on Raw the next night. Well, I hope that's worth ruining this division for!!! Arggghhhh, it wasn't that bad I suppose. The bad booking just irked me way too much. On the positive side, Cade/Jindak seemed to mesh quite well against both Storm/Venis & The Dudleyz. While Steiner & Test actually looked half decent against The Dudleyz toward the end there. Match Rating...5

MOLLY HOLLY defeated IVORY to Retain the Women's Title: Oh man, where do I start on this one!?!?!? Well, I suppose I should start with what dominated the match; The awful commentary of Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler. All they did was go on & on about one or both women being sexually frustrated & irregular. It was possibly amusing the first time they mentioned it, but they just went on & on about it. I mean, it was that bad, it sort of continued to be funny. Meanwhile, the poor women were doing flips off the apron, good wrestling sequences & just generally having a good, if short, women's match. Of course, that didn't matter to JR & The King who continued to talk about being sexually frustrated. Pretty pathetic really. They should be punished for this commentary, and if the WWE approved it, then maybe they should do away with the division. Because if they carry on like that again, I'm guessing the number of women that will take being disrespected like that will be less than 1. Match Rating...5

TRIPLE H defeated BILL GOLDBERG & KANE to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: More terrible booking here, and I'm not even talking about the result. Now I know Kane isn't supposed to be the brightest spark, but the way they used his character during this bout was astonishingly bad. I mean, he may as well have been an Evolution member!!! The best that Kane has looked since being unmasked was when he terrorized Triple H (another heel) in his feud with Goldberg. Then all of a sudden, he does basically everything to help Triple H regain the title. Not even a blatant chair shot to the head by Trips, could avert Kane's double-teaming mentality of Goldberg!!! WTF!?!?!? Apart from that, it was the usual standard big-man power-moves match. Mildly entertaining, Evolution would win the title for Hunter McMahon. Match Rating...5

PPV RATING (37/70) = 53

Looking at the key, I have given Armageddon a 'D' grade & have said that it was 'Mediocre & Disappointing'. Well, to be honest, I was expecting it to be bad, so it didn't really disappoint me. Mediocre is the perfect word to describe it though. This was the second worst pay-per-view of 2003, in my opinion. Judgment Day was worse, because it had more crap on it. But at least that ppv had 2 decent bouts. This struggled to have one. Whoever buys this DVD is simply crazy. And what was with the entire pay-per-view finishing about 10 minutes early!?!?!? What a waste after the excellent Survivor Series last month!!! Everything from the wrestling, to the booking, to the commentating was just plain mediocre here. I didn't even want to watch the follow up Raw, to be honest. Bring on The Royal Rumble & fast!!!",1114732800,3,6831,4.637717121588089
1891695,4,B00009W0VY,"1. BOOKER T vs MARK HENRY

7. GOLDBERG vs KANE vs TRIPLE H (HEAVYWEIGHT)

  The three most dominating men on raw in the one ring. Thought and wanted Kane to win. Triple H wins again after evolution interfered. surprise surprise.

Good opener but Dupree and Suzuki were in controll too long which was boring to watch. Their match on last weeks SD was better. Mysterio and RVD retain the titles after Mysterio hits a double 619 and RVD hits a frogsplash to get the three count.

WINNER-Mysterio/RVD

Tough enough Dixie Dog Fight

Daniel Puder vs. Mike Mizzanin 4/10

For those wondering a Dixie Dog Fight is a three round boxing match with normal boxing rules and this fight is legit. The first round was full on but the final two rounds were slow. no one got knocked out so the crowd decided who won and it was Puder marginaly. Stupid to have two men wanting a wresling contracts in a boxing match on a WWE ppv.

WINNER-Daniel Puder

Tag Team Match

The Basham Brothers vs. Charlie Haas/Hardcore Holly 4.5/10

Was an okay match while it lasted but it was too short to become anything decent. I liked the way the end set up Haas turning on Jackie and Dawn Marie after they cost him and his partner the match. Holly was distracted and got rolled up in the ring for the three count.

WINNER-Basham Brothers

U.S Championship-Street Fight

John Cena vs. Jesus 5/10

Not much of a match. It was only about 5 minutes long and all Cena did was take Jesus all over the arena. In the end Cena hits Jesus with a trash can and a peice of metal allowing him to pick up the win with an F.U while taunting Carlito. After the match Cena destroys Carlito with a chain shot to the head. I was very dissapointed by this match as I expected alot more hardcore action.

WINNER-John Cena

Special Guest Referee-Charlie Haas

Miss Jackie vs. Dawn Marie 3/10

The match lasted about 2 minutes but the aftermath was exellent. After Dawn pinned Jackie by grabbing the tights Jackie was not very happy with Charlie. Charlie then told her that he has been having an affair with Dawn and that he didn't want to marry her. He then took the engagement ring and got down on his knees in front of Dawn Marie but instead of asking her to marry him he asked her why she is such a slut. Charlie then stormed down the rampway to the crowd chanting his name.

WINNER-Dawn Marie

3 on 1 handicapped match

Big Show vs. Kurt Angle,Luther Reigns,Mark Jindrak 6/10

I am tempted to say worst match of the night but when I think about it there were alot worst matches than this. A dull, boring and short match which saw Angles group dominate with submission moves until the end when Show hit an F-5(what the?) for the win.

WINNER-Big Show

Cruiserweight Title

Spike Dudley vs. Funaki 7.5/10

Not the best cruiserweight match ever but was still good. Funaki is actually a good cruiserweight wrestler and deserved to win the title and he did after Spike went for the Dudley Dog but Funaki revrsed into a small cradle for the three count and we have a new Cruiserweight Champ.

WINNER-Funaki

WWE Championship

JBL vs. The Undertaker vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. Booker T 9.5/10

WHAT A MATCH! It was a fast pace the whole way through and we even got some weapon use. Ladders and tables were both used in this gruelling,Hard fought match up. 2 men went through tables, 1 through the announce table and I think everyone got hit with the ladder exept Eddie. The match was perfect length(25 minutes)and was all I expected it to be. Now for the only dissapointing think that cost this match a 10/10 rating, JBL retained the title. When is he going to lose it, it was the perfect time in this match for a new title reign to start. The ending was very eventful with Heidenreich interfering by taking out Taker twice and JBL nailing Booker T with the clotheline from hell for the win.

WINNER-JBL

Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton for the IC Title.  This was one of the better matches of the PPV.  It got me out of my seat and actually rooting for RVD to retain but Orton wins it. (8.5/10)

Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Lita & Trish Stratus in a Battle of the Sexes Match.  Yes, I know this match is bad but still watch it because it has Christian & Y2J in it.  Anyways they win the match and like they weren't. (5.5/10)

Shawn Michaels vs. Batista was a good match and could have been better if it was NO DQ.  They screwed Stone Cold and they have a regular match and it's over and at least HBK wins for Austin. (8/10)

Maven vs. Matt Hardy wasn't even a match and the only reason I'm reviewing it is for the beatdown on Maven by Batista and then Matt covered Maven to win. (3.5/10)

La Resistance vs. Hurricane & Rosey vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs. Dudley Boys vs. Scott Steiner & Test vs. Ric Flair & Batista for the World Tag Titles.  This was a great match and the Dudleyz some how retained and then Flair & Batista come down and pin the Dudleyz and we have new tag champs. (7.5/10)

Molly Holly vs. Ivory for the Women's Title.  This match is not worth seeing and you should just skip to the World Title match.  Molly reatins her title. (4.5/10)

Goldberg vs. Triple H vs. Kane in a No Disqualifications match for the World Title.  Nothing to great and Triple H wins the World Title back thanks to Evolution and the fact that it was NO DQ saved this match because there was power in all 3 corners. (8/10)

This PPV wasn't very good but I would suggest buying it even though it is only 3 stars and this is a high 3 stars but not a 4.  THe best match was probably RVD vs. Orton.",1102809600,,2022,4.130769230769231

Again, the WWE tries to bring up a big man, like Henry, to no avail.  It wasn't the worse match.  They worked decent together.  (7/10)

2. Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton (Intercontinental Title)

I was expecting a lot from this match, but it didn't really deliver.  It was decent, but the two just didn't mix that well together.  (8/10)

Why?  What a waste to use Jericho and Christian in this match.  Don't waste your time with this one.  (4/10)

4. Shawn Michaels vs. Batista

OK match.  Many people thought this match was great, but I wasn't a huge fan.  It was probably Batista's first good match in the WWE.  Although, Michaels pretty much carried him.  (7.5/10)

I didn't want to tell you who the surprise team was, so you can be surprised.  Could have been good, but was really poorly done and very short.  Unimpressive.  (6/10)

7. Molly Holly vs. Ivory (Women's Title)

Not very good.  But, who really cares?  (2/10)

8. Goldberg vs. Triple H vs. Kane (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat/No DQ)

Probably the best match of the night, but that is not saying much.  Triple H was back to his old form in this match.  Besides HBK, he was pretty much the only one that showed up for the PPV.  Evolution makes an appearance in the match.  Not a very good finish.  (8/10)

Do not buy this PPV.  It is pretty much a waste of money.  I think they only had this PPV to show Evolution's dominance.

1891737,3,B00009W0VY,"1) Mark Henry vs. Booker T
The match overall was boring and Booker T won the match in the end. Not a very good opener 3/10
2) Y2J & Christian vs. Lita & Trish
It was not a good match, Y2J and Christian won as expected- if the women have won, the match could be interesting) In the end Christian gets really happy (as if he did something big but Y2J is not -some signs for a story line involving Trish and Y2j:) As a big Y2J fan I felt really sorry for seieing him wrestling girls while he could go and challange for a title 4/10
3) HBK vs. Batista
It was a very good match where Batista dominated HBK through out of the match but HBK managed to win  by countering the sit up powrbomb to a super kick. Batista goes nuts and destroys maven who was thrown in the ring by Matt Hardy who he was going to face next. 9/10
4)Maven vs. Matt Hardy
Actually there were no figh besides the furious batista powerbombing Maven like a mad man and leaving him lying unconciouss in the ring. Then Matt Hardy announces him as the winner. I think he really manages well to act like an idiot!
4) RVD vs. Randy Orton 4 The Inrercontinental Championship
It was a good match with good moves, both wrestlers proved how talented they are and Orton is the new IC Champ after delivering RVD a RKO  8.5/10
5)Molly vs. Ivory 4 the womens championship
Nothing special in this match, molly wins 2/10
6) Tag Team turmoil 4 the Tag Team Championship
Good tag team action with the dudleys come on top BUT then Eric Bishoff adds Batista and Flair to the match  and they beat the h*ll out of the already tired dudleyz and become the new wwe tag champions. I think it was good for the dudleyz to lose their titles to Evolution because everybody in the group is(or was) a champion except Batista and now he also has his belt. 8/10
7)Triple Threat Match for the WWE Heavyweight championship
It was a good match. All the 3 of them worked and performed very well in the ring and Triple H (not suprisingly with the help of evolution :) retained his belt by pinning goldberg. I am really glad that goldberg finally lost the title because he is so exaggerated that no one can withstand him but now he is defated. Still sad for Kane since he deserves to be the champ for a long time 8.5/10
 Now all the members of the Evolution is a champ and yet they are the most dominant force on RAW- they have all the gold on RAW expext the women's title. Yet Armegaddon was a decent ppv if you love evolution buy it, if you love HBK buy it but if you love Y2J seing him wrestling with girls do not :)",1089676800,4,2544,4.185714285714286

The theme of this event was the domination of Evolution, a group comprised of Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista, as they challenged for every RAW brand title at this event. The only non-title match Evolution was involved in was a singles match between Batista and Shawn Michaels, which was the result from Batista's interference in HBK's Elimination match at Survivor Series.

There aren't many highlights at this event, but Randy Orton's Intercontinental Title match against Rob Van Dam with Mick Foley as the guest referee was the easy choice for match of the night. Orton shows his inexperience during the match, yet his style mixes well with RVD, and it planted the seeds for a match with Mick the next year.  Flair's interactions with Foley are a highlight as well.

The main event is a sluggish, formless triple threat match between Goldberg, Kane and Triple H for the World Title. I enjoyed the interaction between the heels; however, the match itself is one of the worst main events of 2003.

Chris Jericho/Christian vs Lita/Trish Stratus Battle of the Sexes: This was horrible, stupid and pathetic, I hated every minute of it, the women botched everything which I was expecting, this was so predictable, it was honestly hard to watch, christian and jerichos worst ever match DUD!!! (0 Stars)

4. Shawn Michaels vs Batista: This was ok, I mean I expected better from these two, the problem with this match is that it dragged on, and it had no real story to it, it was like watching raw, I wasn't suprised by the winner **3/4

5. Dudley Boyz(c) vs Mark Jindrak/Garrison Cade vs Val Venis/Lance Storm vs La Resistance vs Hurricane/Rosey vs Scott Steiner/Test Tag Team Turmoil for the World Tag Team Titles: This wasn't very good at all, it was watchable but not good, there were two many bad teams in this one, La Resistance are one of the worst teams ever, there was a funny botch at the start with hurricane(typical), the ending was predictable **

6. Dudley Boyz(c) vs Batista/Ric Flair World Tag Team Titles: I wasn't expecting this, way to short, not even a minute N/A

7. Goldberg vs Triple H vs Kane WH Title: I like this one, goldberg does some of his good power moves, theres a good table spot which fitted in well with the match, kane was a monster in this match, he was impressive, I've seen people give this match a 2 stars, I think that isn't fair at all, these 3 really did mix well with eachother, with the other members of evolution winning the titles, I wasn't suprised with the outcome, you will really enjoy this one ***1/2

7993388,3,B00009W0VY,"This is one of those events where, for some reason, I just never really got hyped aboout.  So for me, the event would have had to have been catastrophic for me to say that it was a dissapointment.  That's not the case here.  Sure, it is not the best event from 2003, but there weren't too many things wrong with it.  So I guess I'll call that a good thing.  Here's the card:

Mark Henry w/ Theodore Long vs. Booker T
This was one of those matches where there is really nothing to speak of.  I'm not quite sure why they chose to go with this as the opener, considering Henry's style tends to be slow, and boring most of the time.  Theodore Long's annoying voice in the background didn't help this much either.  The match has a dragging pace, and seems to go on for hours.  The only thing that saves this match a little is the chemistry the two have in their matches.

Intercontinental Title:
Rob Van Dam vs. Randy Orton w/ Ric Flair; Mick Foley as special guest referee
Before the match began, Foley came down to the ring to cut a promo about the return of Steve Austin.  Then we are priviliged to see Stacy Kiebler come down and do several cart wheels.  Anyway, as for the match itself (which we were supposed to believe that it wasn't planned to start at this point in the show) was very good.  With his tenure in evolution, Randy Orton did a very good job at making everyone hate him.  He seemed on top of his game on this evening, and any match with RVD certainly makes it one worth watching.  As usual, the ending is kind of cheap, but I do recommend.

Battle of the Sexes:
Chris Jericho & Christian vs. Trish Stratus & Lita
I think the name of this match speaks for itself.  Although it's not quite the disaster you might expect.  Each involved does a good job of selling the ""emotion"" - so that adds to this a little.  The quality of the wreslting, obviously, is not all there, but I think it does as much as a man vs. woman match can do in WWE nowadays.  The match does not go longer than it needs to.  Take it for what it is.  Nowhere near the match of the night, but worth a look.

Batista vs. Shawn Michaels
As you can probably imagine, this is a strong match, literally.  Batista was still kind of new to the company here, and does a good job in his first PPV match as the heavy for evolution.  He shows a lot of animosity, as well as a lot of in-ring charisma.  Shawn Michaels helps carry him through the entire thing, but Batista held his own.  Overall, this one is a good match, has a good flow, and a somewhat interesting ending.

A match between Maven and Matt Hardy was ""supposed"" to take place next, but Batista beat up Maven, and the match never took place.  I don't think anyone was too upset about that though.

World Tag Titles:
Tag team turmoil: Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance vs. Val Venis & Lance Storm vs. Hurricane & Rosey vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. Scott Steiner & Test vs. Batista & Ric Flair
At first, this was a filler match.  Then it had somewhat of a significant ending.  The match had its ups and downs, with the pace picking up at times, and occasionally slowing down to the point of oblivion.  This was just WWE's way of getting all of its tag teams at the time involved in the PPV.  Batista and Flair are a surprise entry at the end.  And yep, you guessed it- they win the belts.  The match is nothing too special, but compared to tag title matches today in WWE, I'll definitly settle for this.

Women's Title:
Molly Holly vs. Ivory
This was another match that hadn't been advertised.  There is nothing really wrong with the match, but there really was nothing right with it either.  Molly and Ivory are two of the better female talents the company has, but the match was slow, boring, and no one in the crowd really gave it their attention.  Probably could have been left off the show.

World Heavyweight Title:
Goldberg vs. Kane vs. Triple H
For me, this was about the time where Kane had begun to become less scary after taking his mask off.  His ability to intimidate people for the latter part of 2003 was incredible- but unfortunately was almost dead by the time he made the main event.  If you know anything about the feud between Goldberg and Triple H, then the sustanence of this match won't surprise you.  Mostly a two on one, with Goldberg being ganged up on.  Triple H is sold as a cowardly competitor, who takes advantage of Goldberg with his group.  Good thing Kane was in this match.  He added something to the feud here.  The match had a few high spots, including HHH taking the belt back from Goldberg.  It's noteworthy to mention that each member of evolution had won gold at this PPV.  They all came out at the end of the match with their respective belts to remind us.

Overall, this show was OK.  The stage was a little underwhelming, and there were few matches to get excited about.  It won't be remembered for anything really, but that's not to say it wasn't an enjoyable event.  I would recommend for a cheaper price (probably less than $10).",1296000000,,5012,4.325456498388829
7993389,3,B00009W0VY,"I see that we don't have too many fans of this one.  I can't say I blame the negative reactions.  ARMAGEDDON 2003 isn't exactly a successful PPV.  There are a few good things to say about, but if you wanna read about them, get ready for a lot of junk.

1) Mark Henry (w/ Teddy Long) v. Booker T
---Well, I can't say that I was looking forward to this one, and I can't say that it's a good way to start a show.  However, it's not as awful as it looks.  Booker sold really well for Henry, and the pace was brisk enough so that we didn't get too bored watching Henry dominate.  Also, the crowd made a considerable amount of noise to keep this one watchable for TV viewers.  All I can say is that this one won't blow away anyone's minds, but it's tolerable for one viewing.
""5.0 / 10""

2) Intercontinental Championship
Special Referee - Mick Foley (RAW Co-GM)
Randy Orton v. Rob Van Dam (champion)
---For whatever reason, Orton came outto run his mouth, which prompted Foley to shut him up and start the match earlier than what (I guess) they originally planned.  But that doesn't really matter, because RVD and Orton put together a very strong contest.  We get to see a nice belnd of grounded submission holds and fancy reversals.  The time length was just right, giving both men enough time to show off their skills.  This match was crucial in getting Orton's career, and RVD ended his IC Title reign on a strong note.  My favorite match on the card.
""8.0 / 10""

3) Battle of the Sexes
Chris Jericho & Christian v. Trish Stratus & Lita
---I don't know why this one gets criticized so much.  So, let's look at the storyline and the in-ring physicality.  The angle was kinda dumb, as two Canadian jerks had a bet over getting their respective ladies into bed.  This story was offensive, but it definitely got a reaction from the crowd.  So although it made for dull TV, it got the live audience going.  As for the wrestling, I actually thought it was decent storytelling.  Christian tried to embarass the Divas, Jericho was reluctant to use his full strength, and Lita & Trish were gonna go out in a blaze of glory in their mismatched situatiion.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a must-see match.  But it's not nearly as awful as most have made it out to be.
""6.0 / 10""

4) Shawn Michaels v. Batista
---I think a lot of people forget how impressive Batista was during his Evolution years.  As a heel, he was one of the scariest competitors on RAW's roster.  Only after his first title victory did his style start to become stale for a few years.  In December 2003, Randy Orton was already in a couple marquee matches, but Dave Batista needed this one to jumpstart his career.  Shawn Michaels has always been a great performer to bring newer talent into the fold.  In my opinion, HBK and Batista not only did an excellent job of making the other look good, I don't think they've had a better one-on-one match since then.  It's still amazing to see how well HBK's stick-and-move strategy meshes with the powerhouse style of Batista.  If there's one negative aspect about this match, it's that it literally cancelled the next match.
""8.0 / 10""
____________________________________________

5) Maven v. Matt Hardy
---As I said, the end of the HBK/Batista contest is the beginning of this one.  Basically, The Animal got so ticked off that he destroyed Maven.  Even though the referees cancelled the match, Matt Hardy insisted on being awarded the pinfall victory.  Yeah, I don't get it either.  I mean, this isn't boring or anything, but I find it sad that this is the second time that Matt Hardy had a forfeited match from a 2003 PPV.
""3.0 / 10"" (inflated because it was to push the Evolution angle)
____________________________________________

6) Tag Team Turmoil - World Tag Team Championships
---There are a total eight teams in this gauntlet-style match, most of them being just two RAW superstars thrown together.  This one constantly gets good, then gets boring, and then back and forth from start to finish.  There are tag contests that excite us, and some that are so short you've no idea when they started.  Having Ric Flair and Batista entered in at the last moment is still a great moment; I always loved Eric Bischoff, and he's the epitome of jackass.  I also loved Evolution, so I enjoyed the finish.  But the match as a whole is very inconsistent.  I think what I took away from this 19-minute Tag Team Turmoil is that longer does not necessarily mean better.
""5.5 / 10""
____________________________________________

7) Women's Championship
Molly Holly (champion) v. Ivory
---What a sad disappointment this was.  I can understand that it was a bonus match, but if I can't fathom how these two ladies just couldn't get it together.  Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler kept commenting on whether Molly was sexually frustated, Ivory just looked like she hadn't performed in quite some time, and overall this was a poor display for the women's division.  It would take almost another whole year before Trish Stratus and Lita would get the Divas matches back on track.
""3.0 / 10""

8) World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H v. Kane v. Goldberg (champion)
---Our main event for ARMAGEDDON 2003 is an acceptable way to close the show, but not an exciting one.  The biggest problem is that the moves don't have the impact that they should.  The weak link that caused this problem would be Goldberg.  I kinda enjoyed some of his matches in the WWE, but on this night, he was pretty sloppy.  He oversold some punches, and undersold others.  Whenever he would tackle Kane, the timing between the two was way off.  And it didn't help that his Spanish annoucer table spot(s) unconvincingly put him out of action.  Triple H and Kane used some neat storytelling to keep things going, with both men reluctantly working together, only to have them inevitably fight it out.  Because the match is kept to a nice pace and features some good moments, I enjoyed it.  But, it's not exactly RAW's finest main event.
""6.5 / 10""
____________________________________________

I've always considered ARMAGEDON 2003 to be a throwback to The Four Horsemen.  The Evolution faction gained all of RAW's gold, played the numbers game effectively, and found success even in defeat.  Two of Evolution's matches were some of 2003's finest, while the others were passable.  It's a shame the rest of the card didn't come together.  If Booker T & Mark Henry weren't in the opener, they would've bored a lot more people.  Maven & Matt hardy deserved better than what they got.  And the Divas really got shafted with a poor Women's Title Match & an offensive intergender angle.
I recommend you try to find Evolution's matches on YouTube for free.  But if you can't, then only buy this DVD at a very cheap price.  It isn't as horrible as most have claimed it to be, but it's still a letdown.",1233273600,,7027,4.7775933609958505

7993391,4,B00009W0VY,"I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a random PPV event from 2003, but I got it anyway.  I was expecting lots of raw power wrestling, brutality from Evolution, and I got that, so I can't say I was disappointed there, but there were plenty of other disappointments to bring this down a star/star and a half.

Mark Henry vs Booker T

Oh wow... any match you put Mark Henry in tends to be an utter disaster.  He's unbelievably fat and so stiff it's impossible to see him doing much more than squinting his beady little eyes till they're invisible beneath those massive rolls of fat, and go and hug someone in a ""bearhug"".  Booker T couldn't do anything as he was being dominated by Henry and his five moves of doom.  (0/10)

Randy Orton vs Rob Van Dam

Randy Orton can wrestle!  And Rob Van Dam is one of a kind.  Putting them in here together is a chance for stellar happenings.  Unfortunately, the momentum of the match was brought to a screeching and disgustingly disappointing halt many many many times by Randy Orton's lame chokeholds and half-assed, half-hearted submissions, keeping Rob Van Dam down on the ground for minutes at a time, dragging the match to a total stop while the fans boo.  I'm sure if smarter fans populated the arena, you'd have ""WE WANT WRESTLING"" chants being hurled at Orton.  If it was just Orton trying to sell the whole ""Evolution is evil and I'm evil"" angle, he could've done something other than ruin what could have been the best match of the night.  (7/10 and that's being generous)

Chris Jericho and Christian vs Lita and Trish Stratus

Lol.  That's sort of the reaction I had to this sort of match.  Since WWE refuses to have their Women's division be anything more than eye candy with five actual wrestling moves, this one disappointed.  Really there was little redeeming factors here---Trish slaps, and Lita does some Hurricanranas, and the boys just sort of taunt the girls and do a few moves.  (3/10)

Shawn Michaels vs Batista

I'm not usually one to like power wrestlers like Batista, but he just really sold his skill and charisma, and became every inch the ""Animal"" of Evolution, that I fell in love with him, and made me a fan of his power style.  He works great as a heel, and doesn't particularly work as the face he is now, dressing in those cheap suits and sunglasses and making dorky speeches about ""yknow i respect the undertaker, an i love him and such, but i want the dubdubee heavyweight title, yknow?"".  Michaels is his usual self, and carries Batista greatly.  (8/10)

Maven vs Matt Hardy

No match.  Nothing started, no pins.  Maven and Matt Hardy fight on the outside while Batista fumes in the ring at his loss, then Maven is thrown in and destroyed by Batista.  Matt tries to pin him but no referee will count.  Not a match.

Tag Team Turmoil Match

La Resistance vs The Hurricane and Rosey vs Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak vs The Dudley Boys (C) vs Scott Steiner and Test vs Batista and Ric Flair

This match varied on who was fighting.  Some teams like Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade were on fire and really fueling the match, whereas other teams like Steiner (steroids) and Test just brought it to a stop.  Test does some power wrestling, but Steiner quite literally does nothing distinguishable as wrestling.  An elbow drop or two, a few slams, nothing really impressive.  Batista and Ric Flair are announced at the last minute as the seventh team and they defeat the Dudley Boys for the championship.  (7/10)

Women's Championship Match

Molly Holly (C) vs Ivory

No.  Just no.  If WWE refuses to make anything of its Women's division, they shouldn't be putting them in matches on pay per view.  (0/10)

World Heavyweight Championship

Goldberg (C) vs Kane vs Triple H

Okay so this one went well all things considered.  ""All things considered"" means taking into account that HHH and Kane teamed up against Goldberg for about 90% of the match, and HHH played the cowardly heel gimmick way too much, panicking at Kane while he made some of his most ugliest faces ever.  Goldberg really doesn't get to do much, as maybe midway through the match he's put through the Spanish announcer's table and is out for all but the very end of the match.  All in all, it was a bit fun... about enough to be considered a great match for an average TV appearance of RAW.  (6.5/10)

All in all... solid.  Disappointing, yes, maybe, but solid.  Something that I wish we'd see more of in the new WWE modern days where athleticism is sacrificed in the name of predictability and boring talent-less matches.",1178236800,5,4560,4.604477611940299
