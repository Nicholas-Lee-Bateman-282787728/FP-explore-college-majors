7936800,1,B00005B6KW,"Of the Relationship Labyrinth genre, this work, filmed and set in Regina, Saskatchewan, with Canadian players and crew is, just the same, rife with bromides nurtured in United States based pictures, as evidenced by its predictable scenes and dialogue relating incidents concerning a coterie of men in their late twenties whose lifestyles and interests revolve about young women and playing basketball.  Sam (Michael Goorjian) and his teammates from a church league cage quintet have enormous troubles in their relationships with females, and when he as well as his best friend (David Lovgren) seek the affections of Kelly, played by Chandra West, expected complexities are the result, especially since the two have widely disparate abilities when in company with the gentler sex.  Although there is genuine chemistry between Goorjian and West, character development is lacking within the script, and most of the portrayed personalities are basically unpleasant as depicted, as are many of the scenes that are additionally marred by erratic direction and mean-spirited endeavours at humour that are simply not funny, and while Sam spasmodically cites philosophers Kierkegaard, Sartre, Camus and Descartes, they are quoted in an embarrassingly witless fashion.  Continuity weaknesses often appear along with a shortfall of storyline logic, and at no time does the scenario reveal anything of the men's occupations, as apparently they only play basketball and chase women, but Lovgren takes the acting garland with his solid reading as a persistent libertine, and striking compositions from cinematographer Jon Kranhouse enable one to upon occasion ignore the discursive plot.",1109376000,3,1673,5.604743083003952
