8630106,5,B00H4ZEHWG,Our household loves Martha! Our son stumbled across this show on PBS Kids one day and after watching came and told his dad and I he wanted to go outside and ambulate. We didn't know what this meant until we looked it up lol but he learned that word from Martha Speaks. His love for vocabulary has grown so much from this and he retains all the information because it's packed into a fun and interesting story line for kids. This is a total package. Fun and educational!,1459641600,,469,4.340909090909091
8630107,5,B00H4ZEHWG,"My nephew adores this! He asked for another one for his birthday. I cried watching the episode about the dogs in the pound! One of the only cartoons I find interesting. If your kid has never watched this, still give it a try. It is amazing. A really good cartoon about a dog who eats alphabet soup and it loses its way from her stomach to her brain. Really cute idea!",1458345600,,367,4.183098591549296
