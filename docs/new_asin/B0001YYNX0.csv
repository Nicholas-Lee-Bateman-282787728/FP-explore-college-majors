2044110,5,B0001YYNX0,"Though the cassette was made in the mid 80's, the prints of these 7 Technicolor shorts produced by Walt Disney between 1933-1938 remain sharp considering their age. As with every volume of this rare ""Gold Edition"" series, this is one to get your hands on if you're a fan of the Silly Symphonies other than ""Flowers and Trees"", ""The Three Little Pigs"", and ""The Old Mill"".",1120694400,4,371,4.636363636363637

8018690,5,B0001YYNX0,"This was purchased as a gift for my younger sister who absolutely adored these when we were little. We had some trouble getting it to play in my VCR, but I am pretty sure its the fault of the player & not the tape. The Seller was extremely helpful & offered to give us a DVD version of it so we could be sure it would play without 'eating' the original but I was able to sort it out on my own.",1397606400,,393,3.8048780487804876

8018692,5,B0001YYNX0,This product was in excellent condition when I received it. It's an old tape so I didn't expect the quality to be perfect and was pleased at its overall appearance on arrival. It played well with the few minor glitches inherent to old VHS cassettes but overall it worked great. I would purchase from this seller again.,1250899200,,318,4.5964912280701755
8018693,5,B0001YYNX0,"In 1984, Disney released special limited editions of their ""Cartoon Classics"" tapes. This one is one of the best. Even though no major Disney characters are portrayed, all of these classic Silly Symphonies are very good. If you like more than just the ones that everybody knows and likes (which would be ""The Three Little Pigs,"" ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" and ""The Old Mill""), then check this out. Also, it's worth it to see what sort of ideas were portrayed in these cartoons. It begins with 1933's ""Birds in the Spring."" In one way, this is among the best portrayals of the whole ""birds and the bees"" that your parents told you about, in that a poor little baby bird swallows a bee and ends up getting laughed at when his father tries to teach him to sing. Next is ""The China Shop."" Though many of these cartoons are somewhat obscure, I am guessing that when Disney was working on ""Toy Story,"" the concept of this cartoon certainly helped shape their idea: an old man owns a China Shop, but when he goes away all the China comes to life. Third is ""The Flying Mouse."" Somewhat of an unusual story is portrayed here. You don't often see stories about a mouse wishing he could fly, but what is most notable about this cartoon is that the fairy who gives him wings may very well have been a prototype for the blue fairy in ""Pinnochio."" Short number 4 is ""The Cookie Carnival."" In a sense, this is much like a Cinderella story made short. However, anyone young would get a huge charge out of the fact that candy and sweets are the entire cast of characters. Notably, a couple scenes were cut out for the TV version: in the parade sequence, Miss. Licorice is cut out because it is a picaninny African American. Also, when the cookie princess is looking for a suitor, the ""Jolly Rum Cookies"" are cut out, since they are heavily intoxicated. Moving right along, we go to one of my personal favorites of all time: ""Woodland Cafe."" Although I have a deep contempt for bugs, this portrays the critters as we would like to imagine them: dancing to jazzy music in a bar, puffing a cigar and having a beer. Once again, parts of this were cut out when it was broadcast on television. In the segment where a spider is PWN3D by a lady bug, the scene with the Ladybug smoking behind the curtain was cut out. Also, the jazz band leader is a rather offensive portrayal of Cab Calloway as a cricket, and this was edited out as well. Next in line is one that may be a bit frightening to younger children, actually: ""The Moth and the Flame."" Naturally, this one portrays a pair of moths (who actually have a closer resemblance to humans with wings and feelers) fighting a flame. The thing that actually frightened me a little bit was the devilish grin on the face of the flame. Overall, this one was very enjoyable. Last but not least is ""Farmyard Symphony."" When you watch this one, it is noticeable that Silly Symphonies lost their usual bouncy, consistent rhythm in the later 1930's, but still were able to portray beautiful music and artwork to various scenarios. This was ultimately the most realistic silly symphony of it's time. The animals were beautifully animated, and they didn't really have any cutesy looks to them. While this does not contain as many Silly Symphonies as I would like to see, it contains enough to satisfy me for now. Definetely worth looking for at a bargain store.",1151366400,11,3377,4.528641571194763
