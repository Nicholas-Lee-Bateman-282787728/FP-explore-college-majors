1917089,5,B0000CABL2,"South Park, my favorite show ever, is the greatest. Cartman is funnier than anyone. The South Park movie Bigger Longer and Uncut is the greatest 95 minutes spent of my life. The swearing is great. ""You donkey raping ...."" That's great. And you can't forget the B**** Song.
South Park, as Cratman says, Kick [tail].",1065312000,,314,4.7272727272727275
1917090,5,B0000CABL2,"The Third season of South Park is by far the best season. Nothing could top this. Every episode is hilarious, even Jackovasaurs. Since I am the first reviewer, I will list the episodes.
Rainforest Shmainforest - The boys get sent to Costa Rica by Mr. Mackey to sing in the kids choir ""Getting Gay with Kids"". While there, the group gets lost in the jungle. Jennifer Aniston is hilarious as the choir teacher.
Spontaneous Combustion - The mayor wants Stan's dad to figure out why the citizens of South Park are spontaneously combusting. Also, Stan and Kyle tie Cartman to a cross so that he can be ressurected.
The Succubus - The boys become worried when chef falls in love with a weird woman and gets engaged to her. This is the first appearance of chef's hilarious parents.
Tweek vs. Craig - The boys bet on who would win in a fight between Tweek and Craig.
Jackovasaurs - The kids discover an ancient race of creatures. However, they are the most annoying creatures ever to exist.
Sexual Harassment Panda - A man in a panda suit comes to south park to teach kids about sexual harassment.
Cat Orgy - Cartman and Shelly fight with each other while she is baby-sitting him.
Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub - Stan is stuck in Mr. Mackeys basement with Butters, Pip, and Dougie during a party.
Jewbilee - Kyle and Kenny go to a Jewish scout meeting.
Chinpokomon - some familiar looking Japanese toys brainwash every kid in America.
Starvin Marvin in Space - The Boys help Starvin Marvin when some missionairies invade his country.
Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery - The Band Korn help the boys solve a Halloween mystery in this hilarious Scooby-Doo spoof.
Hooked on Monkey Phonics - Two strange, sheltered home-school kids decide to go to South Park Elementary.
The Red Badge of Gayness - Cartman decides to conquer America and change the outcome of the Civil War to win a bet with Stan and Kyle.
Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics - a collection of South Park Christmas songs.
Are you there God? It's Me, Jesus - Jesus is upset that no one cares about him anymore. Cartman thinks he is having a period.
World Wide Recorder Concert - The boys come up with a ridiculous plan to get revenge on some New York kids who made fun of them.
All of these episodes are hilarious. You have to buy this.",1063238400,31,2283,4.543689320388349

1917100,1,B0000CABL2,"The rating of one star isn't so much for the content of the DVD, as it is the quality of the DVD. I love southpark. I hate discs that skip. For starters the outside case sleeve was missing (I have most of the other seasons so I'm well aware of how they're packaged), and that should have been my sign. But I said screw it, popped out a disc,light scratches. Oh well still could be fine. Popped the second, deeper scratches. Disappointment set it. And of course the third disc was riddled as well. First disc skipped a touch. Second at least a while chapter. And we shall see about the third. Definitely gonna try to swap it out for one not more suited for the trash heap.",1503273600,,671,4.25

(Beware of Seller changes! That's when you may get burned!)

::PROS::
1.)  Great episodes, I laughed a lot more then I do at the new ones.
2.)  Packaging is the LARGE cardboard box style, NOT plastic DVD case.
3.)  Has bars, but I expect that since it's PRE-HD era episodes.

:: CONS ::
1.)  This version uses the COMPLEX- MULTI-SESSION method - sucks for MP4 conversion!
2.)  On standard media player you get the black interlacing when action or pan occurs - need a good DVD encoder NOT media player!

:: OVERALL :: I like this season it's funnier then the later seasons in my opinion.  I HATE THE MULTI-SESSION COMPLEX READ CRAP, but I am still glad I bought it :)",1479859200,2,730,4.388059701492537

""Coal trucks were sent out to collect women. Age didn't matter; girls as young as 11 and women as old as 80. Virgins were prized to affirm a warrior's virility. Twenty soldiers might rape a woman. Or, out of sadism, they might order a father on a daughter.""

I just received my copy of it in the mail yesterday actually,i worked in the morning but when i got home i popped in the first disc and watched my favorite episodes that i have not seen since i was a kid,i was born in 90 and watched em as a kid and thought they were the best. You just don't get the same great episodes nowadays as you did back in the days when they just started and went on their own stories,where today they just make a joke off something global. Which is okay but when it comes to laughs for me it's the first 4 seasons. After they enter 4th grade things just got a little bit more cheesy(which is fine) but these are the best. They don't even play these episodes anymore so if you get a chance and you know the episodes im talking about pick it up. My favorites are Rainforest,Succubus,Monkey Phonics,Spontanious Combustion,Chinpokomon,Korns Halloween episode and Starvin Marvin In Space.",1371772800,,1010,4.494565217391305

Interesting writing sometimes, but I hate that kind of cartoon look.  It even annoys me, and it is a little too crude in general for me, or appealing to the stupid too much, or something, maybe exemplified by the very basic style of the cartoon drawings.

1917189,4,B0000CABL2,"'South Park: Season 3' is bold, daring, original, and very funny. While Season 1 of South Park might have been a little funnier, Season 3 has great social satire, and embraces sexual topics rarely if ever mentioned on TV. Season 3 successfully leaves behind any sophomore slump found in Season 2. The stories are varied and not formulaic. The characters do, unfortunately, sometimes break into song, but it's fairly rare.

1917192,5,B0000CABL2,"Season 3 continued the awesome goodness of the first two seasons of South Park, and though it was not as consistent as season 2, it contained a few episodes that were by themselves considerably stronger than anything from the previous season.  ""Rainforest Schmainforest"" and ""Chinpokomon"" together became likely my two favorite episodes at the time that I first saw them.  Both are hilarious and spot-on parodies of, in turn, bleeding heart feel-good hypocritical liberalism and insane and inexplicable pop culture phenomenon pokemon.  Likely the series' best celebrity appearance ever can be seen in the episode ""Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery,"" which features the band Korn as a Scoobie Dooesque group of paranormal crime solvers.  The one big blemish on this season was the episode ""Jackovasaurus,"" which tried to make fun of stupid Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks.  I think that Stone and Parker miscalculated here, though, when they assumed that any representation of Jar Jar, even a farcical one, could be anything less than completely obnoxious.

Finally, I'll always be thankful for ""Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics.""  I play this episode every year on Christmas morning.  Great songs.",1272412800,,1199,5.340425531914893

1917204,5,B0000CABL2,"Many times, something will appear in the media - be it a movie, comic book or TV show - that is shocking and winds up attracting the audience merely because of the shock value.  Eventually, that quality goes away and the reader or viewer finds there is little else there.  For a decade, South Park has defied this rule:  not only does it continue to be edgy, but beyond the edginess, there is real humor and often a worthwhile statement as well.

In Season Three, the foursome of third-graders - Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny - get involved in new adventures.  Once again, little is safe from creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone:  among the subjects of their pointed humor:  Pokemon, the rain forest, child molesters, Jar Jar Binks and the Y2K phenomenon (as well as Sally Struthers, God, Jesus and Civil War reenactors.

Probably my favorite episode of this season is Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery, a take-off on Scooby Doo cartoons featuring members of the band Korn in place of Fred, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma and Scooby.  Who are the mysterious ghost pirates (or pirate ghosts) that haunt South Park?  You'll have to watch and find out.

What also stands out about this season is what could be known as The Meteor Shower trilogy.  In this series of three episodes, we follow different characters all on the night of a meteor shower:  Cartman is babysat by Shelly (Stan's mean older sister); Stan is stuck in the basement at a party while ATF agents are ready to blow up the place thinking there is a cult inside; and Kenny and Kyle go to Jewbilee, a Jewish camp where Moses visits.  More than any earlier episodes, this trilogy shows that Parker and Stone were willing to break free from their normal storytelling and do something different.

Happily, even the weaker episodes (of which there only a few - I'd rate Sexual Harassment Panda towards the bottom) are four-star quality, so this is definitely a five-star set overall.  If you've never viewed South Park, this may be as good a place as any to start, but be prepared:  if you offend easily, this is not the cartoon for you.  If, on the other hand, you like shows that not only push the envelope but go outside it, South Park is a joy to watch.",1166227200,5,2207,4.586734693877551

1917208,5,B0000CABL2,"The third season was funny!  Out of the stories I liked: Rainforest Shaminforest, Tweek vs. Craig, Cat Orgy, Two guys naked in a tub, Jewbilee, Starvin Marvin in space, the Red Badge of Gayness and Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics the best.

Rainforest Shmainforest:  Jennifer Aniston took part in this episode and did a  good job as the leader of the Save the Rainforest group ""Getting Gay with Kids""  They head to Costa Rica and get lost in the rainforest  during a tour their guide gets eaten by a snake.  Cartman of course goes about trying to beat all animals with a stick and Kyle learns as a Jew his has no rhythm!  Watch the performances of the choir.  His dancing is off!  There is a joke with a reference to the cheerleader outfit from friends.

Spontaneous Combustion:  People are spontaneously combusting and it's up to Stan's Dad to figure out why.  He wins the Nobel award for his discovery.  However, sometimes the cure is worst then the disease!  There is a second story where the boys crucify Cartman so he can have a resurrection in order to help Kyle's father get an erection.

The Succubus:  Chef is in love and wants to get married!  Only a demon from hell could accomplish this feat.  How will the boys defeat her?  There is a side story with Carman having eye problems and has to visit an insulting doctor.  ""How is my little piggy today?""  It's a funny story.  Especially when Cartman's eyes are dilated!

Tweek vs. Craig:  This was a funny episode!  Tweek and Craig are tricked into a knock down battle royal to see who would win the fight.

Jackovasaurs:  In the tradition of Jar-Jar, the boys discover a forgotten ancient race of creatures.  What started as amazing turns out to be annoying!  To make matters worst, Cartman is deputized to take care of them.  Of course the government people fled town!

Sexual Harassment Panda:  It is time to learn about Sexual Harassment.  Who better to teach then a man in a Panda suit?  Soon, everybody is suing everybody over sexual harassment.

Cat Orgy:  Cartman gets a babysitter while his mom gets off to a Meteor Shower party.  Cartman meets his match when Shelly enters the house.  He quickly learns to respect her authority!  He decides to take his revenge with Shelly's 22 year old boyfriend appears (she is 12).  While this goes on, the cat goes out and parties rather heavily.  You get to see many things like cats doing lines of catnip!

Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub:  Continuing the side stories from Cat Orgy, we switch to Stan who is dragged to the Meteor party and is locked downstairs with three nerdos(butters, Pip, and Dougie).  Butters finds a crate of women's cloths (why does Mr. Mackey have them?) and they decide to play Charlies Angels.  Stan puts them to work to figure out a way to escape their prison.  While this goes on Stan and Kyle's dad share a moment and Stan's dad is embarrassed and tries to avoid Kyle's dad almost like they were a couple.  While this goes on the ATF appears as they think the party is a cult determined to commit suicide.  They deal with the situation as they did in Waco.

Jewbilee: Continuing the side stories from Cat Orgy, Kyle invites Kenny  on a trip with his Jew scout trip to a camp.  Kyle's brother has to stay with the squirts and their leader attempts to get his chutzpah badge and tangles with a bear who keeps taking squirts.  While in the camp, the council of leaders prepares for the coming of Moses.  They meet the leader of the Jewish branch of anti-Semites who has a plan to bring back Haman.  Kenny and Kyle to the rescue!

Chinpokomon: A new fad involving toys from Japan.  Of course Kyle can't keep up with the fad.  The toys start brainwashing all children to defeat the evil power which involves attacking Pearl Harbor.  Wait till you see how the Japanese leaders deal with the concerns of the parents when they are found out!  The parents save the day with this story with a tried and true way of parenting!

Starvin Marvin in Space:  Starvin Marvin is back and discovers a space ship from Marklark.  Marvins enlists the aid of the boys to help his people escape the missionaries.  The government wants the ship and works with the Hut Sally Struthers to stop them.  Pat Robertson and the 600 club also want to bring the word of God to the marklark

Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery:  This was an ok little story that has the band Korn appear and deal with a Scooby-Doo mystery spoof.  I never noticed the docks in South Park.  ;)

Hooked on Monkey Phonics: Cartman is going to enter the spelling bee.  His mom buys the Hooked on Monkey Phonics package to help him spell.  A capuchin monkey plays the drums for him.  At the contest two home schooled kids appear and even though Kyle was expected to win(""You always bet on the Jew""), the two kids win.  Kyle falls in love and the others want to duct tape the boy and his father to benches.

The Red Badge of Gayness:  It's civil war re-enactment day.  The boys are practicing their drum and flutes playing as they prepare to march with the Union.  Cartman keeps messing up as he explains you have to beat the drum into submission.  He breaks the drum and decides to join the South.  A bet happens and Cartman decides to conquer the North and free the confederate states.  His army swells as people get drunk on S'mores schnapps.  He eventually decides to march on Washington.  Memerable line:  We sent the word for help and the entire state of South Carolina came""

Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics:  This was a funny collection of South Park Christmas songs.  I kind of liked ""It's Christmas time in Hell"" which features noted people like Hitler and Jimmy Stewart (runs by screaming Merry Christmas movie house!).

Are you there God? It's Me, Jesus:  Nobody cares about Jesus anymore.  This changes with the millennium.  People are interested and he decides to hold a concert and tries to get dad to make an appearance.  Cartman thinks he is growing up as he gets his period (he bleeds out his bum).  It happens to Kenny.  Kyle and Stan feel left out.  Kyle decides to lie about it and Stan tries to figure out why it isn't happening to him.  How to help?  Chef and Doctor Mephesto.

World Wide Recorder Concert:  The class is going to a 4 million recorder event to play ""my country tis of thee""  It's funny to watch Mr. Garrison trying to teach them.  The boys run into some kids from New York who insults them to no end.  They decide to get their revenge using the brown note.  A note that causes people loose control of their bowels.  There is a side story with Mr. Garrison where he has to come to grips with why his father (from Arkansas) didn't abuse him as a child.

1917217,5,B0000CABL2,"This season is definetely one of the top South Park seasons. The first episode about the Rainforest shows this very well, featuring a musical group called ""Getting Gay With Kids"" and a hilarious trip to the Rainforest. It ends up mocking the environmentalist movement while, at the same time, being one of the funniest South Park episodes ever.

Another classic is the final episode which features Mr. Garrison being mad at his dad because he DIDN'T molest him as a child. This is one of the funniest (and screwed up) moments in television history. Other episodes feautre Ethiopians going into space, the Japaneese taking over America with Chinpokomon, (gotta catch 'em all) the entire town of South Park trying to take over the South while drunk, and more.

Also, the collection itself is very well put together. There are three DVD's, and each contain 5-6 episodes, totalling to 17 episodes. They also contain very interesting mini-commentary from the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. These are fun to listen to.

1917218,5,B0000CABL2,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone were at the time making the South Park movie as well as creating the show so certain episodes fall flat while others were just downright hilarious. It doesn't really have an effective finale like usual but it's still a great season.

Rainforest Schmainforest: The boys and guest star Jennifer Aniston get lost in the rainforest while in Central America. Hearing Jennifer losing it at the end is awesome. Kenny actually doesn't die all the way for once. 10/10

Spontaneous Combustion: Kenny and some others spontaneously combust so Stan's dad tries to explain why. Turns out that the solution doesn't help and neither would a different one so moderation is key. Not a favorite episode. 7/10

The Succabus: Cartman gets teased by the local optometrist and needs his eyes fixed while Chef falls for a new woman which the boys don't like, and found out something odd about her. Same as last one. 7/10

Jakovasaurs: Cartman finds a new species in Stark's Pond and needs the 2 to procreate. Only thing is they're incredibly annoying. Great satire about Jar Jar Binks, with Cartman acting like George Lucas(George actually likes Jar Jar). 8/10

Tweek vs. Craig: The boys try to get Tweek to fight Craig only they don't want to. Their shop teacher has nightmares about his past love and Kenny is quite afraid of shop class. 9/10

Sexual Harassment Panda: One of the season's ""clunkers"", even Trey and Matt don't like it. Kyle's dad finds himself in a good position as people sue everybody thanks to a panda. Theme song's funny though. 6/10

Cat Orgy: Part 1 of an unofficial trilogy. It takes place over one night but it's not a continuing story-line. A Cartman centered episode as he tries to reach his mom attending a meteor shower party because Shelly the babysitter brought a guy over. 9/10

Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub: Part 2 of the ""meteor shower"" trilogy. Stan centered episode as ATF agents think a local party is actually a cult. Proper introduction of Butters. 9/10

Jewbilee: Part 3 of the ""meteor shower"" trilogy. Kyle and Kenny attend Jewbilee but sneaks Kenny in since he isn't jewish and they find an anti-semitic priest wanting to summon a demon with Moses out of the way. 9/10

Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery: Korn guest-star as Scooby Doo like characters trying to solve the mystery of pirate ghosts(or is that ghost pirates?). Kinda lame episode to be honest but not because of Korn. 7/10

Chinpokomon: A incredibly funny satire about the Pokemon craze as Kyle just can't keep with the new fads and the Chinpokomon company as something up their sleeve involving their new products. 9/10

Hooked on Monkey Fonics: Kinda lame episode where the boys meet the Cutswalds, 2 kids who were homeschooled but entering public school only they keep getting duct-taped to benches. 7.5/10

Starvin Marvin in Space: Pretty funny episode and even graphically impressive in 2 scenes as Starvin Marvin returns to bring the starving ethiopians to a distant planet. Seeing Sally Struthers as a Jabba-like creature is quite funny. Favorite part is the Christian cable newscasters requesting money for spaceship stuff. 8/10

The Red Badge of Gayness: Cartman takes a bet a bit too seriously as he gets the southern side of the Civil War re-enactors to actually start taking over parts of the US for real. My absolute favorite part is when Cartman gets his beard ripped off and he does this big scream that you can literally hear on other planets. 10/10

Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics: Fans of the movie will love this. My favorite is the multi-part Dreidel song with 4 vocal parts going on at once, Satan's song for namedropping Andy Di*k, Mr. Mackey's weird Carol of the Bells and Cartman doing O Holy Night. 9/10

Are You There God, It's Me Jesus?: To be honest, I can't comment on this episode. I rented the set and the previous renters made it impossible to watch this. ****ers. Which is another thing: Be sure to buy this. ?/10

Worldwide Recorder Concert: The boys head to Arkansas to participate in a recorder concert playing My Country Tis of Thee run by Yoko Ono and Kenny G. Cartman is looking for the brown noise while Mr. Garrison shows that he's really ****ed up. 8/10

There's probably more laugh out loud parts for this season than there was last year. I still get a kick out of Cartman getting his beard ripped off or Kyle's marklar speech. But again, buy this set, not only for the comedy but because renters just plain suck.",1117756800,2,4466,4.755498059508409
1917219,3,B0000CABL2,"i loved season 2 and was sorely disappointed with all of the first five episodes of season 3. i hardly laughed throughout any of them, and they seemed to just lazily recycle some of the stuff in season 2. the rainforest episode's final rundown of facts about casualties the rainforest has caused redeems it somewhat, but the rest just makes no sense. jennifer aniston's teacher character is supposed to be for the rainforest but this makes the name of her group and the song lyrics pointless and unfunny. however after sexual harassment panda, which was funny, they seem to regain their footing, with the episode with cartman and stan's sister being absolutely brilliant. i think when cartman isn't funny, south park isn't funny. his repeated ""mostly...mostly"" line is as hilarious as his lines in ""club houses"", another classic cartman episode.",1114473600,,845,5.042857142857143

1917224,2,B0000CABL2,"I am a big fan of South park, actually at this moment i'm wearing a ""SAVE KENNY"" T-shirt! (if that makes a difference!)
So it hurts me to say that i really did not enjoy this season for many reasons...one, no commentary from matt and trey (the creators) before every episode. Two, the shows just weren't that funny except for the pokeman episode (a classic!). Three, It just seemed very rushed to get to the stores before the christmas shopping rush. (Guess what, i did get it for Christmas!)
Now that being said, there are some episodes that are ok, some weak and some,  unwatchable. (especially the jewish camp one, and i'm not even jewish)
TAKE MY ADVICE, FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN ""SOUTH PARK"", MAKE IT EASIER ON YOURSELF AND START OFF WITH SEASON 4...YOU'LL ENJOY IT MORE!",1089763200,,783,4.5928571428571425
1917229,5,B0000CABL2,"First of all South Park has always been hilarious through each and every episode. Back when it started I hated it for some reason, but now I see the genius of this great show. I have just finished viewing this set and I think it was better overall than the first two seasons. I guess why I love the show as much as I do is Cartman, who kills me pretty much anytime he opens his mouth. Some of the included episodes I had seen before and others I had not. I just saw Rainforest Shmainforest for the first time and it cracked me up. A lot of the dialogue from that one is centered on Cartman, and those are my favorite episodes. Another great episode is the Red Badge of Gayness, where ""General Cartman Lee"" convinces drunk Confederate soldiers in a re-enactment to march on the south, and Kenny dies at the Battle of Fort Sumter in the process. I listen to Korn, so the episode Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery is another one I hold in high regards. It has some great references to the classic Scooby-Doo series as well which is great to see.
So I think that Season 3 brought more sharp humor than season 1 and 2 and the show was beginning to really achieve greatness. Overall, even with the lack of any good extras, it is a nice dvd box set to own. Yes, it is over-priced, but that is a small price to pay when you can have South Park at your disposal anytime you wish to see it. So I recommend this set, and now I will view the season 4 set that I just picked up today. I swear this show gets even better every season that passes.",1088553600,2,1533,4.164983164983165
1917230,3,B0000CABL2,"Season 3 isn't quite as good as the first two seasons, but still good. That being said, on to the subject of my review: THE PRICING.
The South Park sets are way too expensive all things considered:
1. Xena, Buffy, and other one-hour shows put on DVD contain about 22 episodes per set. South Park sets, on the other hand, have around 17 HALF-HOUR episodes each and are priced about the same. Does that make sense?
2. South Park is a CARTOON that costs NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING, to make. The animation is cheap (on purpose of course) and very few voice actors do all the voices, so that means there are virtually NO production costs. So how can they be priced the same as other TV-on-DVD sets, such as Buffy and Xena? Is it because South Park has a smaller market audience (ie. adults only) and thus can't sell as many sets? Or is this just a simple case of robbing the poor to give to the rich?
3. The extras, well, WHAT EXTRAS. The ""commentary minis"" are a  joke, and an insult to loyal fans. Besides these half-assed commentaries, there are only promos and advertisements plaguing these sets. Wut up, yo?
Trey and Matt thieves? Why am I not surprised? haha",1088467200,,1158,4.436619718309859

1917232,5,B0000CABL2,"This is one of my all-time favorite cartoons. Something about the obnoxious humor, the animation, and the fact that Kenny dies in almost every episode make this a great cartoon. And the third season was one of my favorite seasons. So here it is: The complete third season on DVD. What more could you ask for?",1087257600,,308,4.517857142857143
1917233,5,B0000CABL2,"South park is probably the best cartoon ever made, it is much better than simpsons or futurama although they are funny as well.
Anybody with a sense of humour should like it, my favourite character is timmy or cartman, i enjoy watching the commentary at the beginning of the episodes although unfortunately they didn't put any in the second season. I am 13, and i think this isn't too grown up for most people of my age, the swearing isn't that bad and people of my age with any sense will understand all of it.",1085616000,2,511,4.389473684210526
1917234,5,B0000CABL2,"Season Three of SOUTH PARK was funny funny funny despite (or maybe because) Matt and Trey were strung out from doing the movie and the show simultaneously.  The season starts off strong with Jennifer Aniston as a touring choir director out to save the rainforest, and every episode afterwards is just as good!  They skewer everything -- Pokemon, The Stations of the Cross, Sexual Harassment ... you name it!
One reviewer on down the line said they did not approve of the BAD LANGUAGE!  What the hell!??!  I was shocked to see the bleeps still in the show like they aired on COMEDY CENTRAL, but they sort of make it funny.  The mini-commentaries (each episode gets 4 minutes!) are a scream!  SOUTH PARK like the SIMPSONS has somehow kept up its bite and edge over the years, and SEASON THREE is no exception.  All the stuff we love - Kenny still dies in every episode, Cartman still whines ""Screw you guys I'm going home!"" and ""Repect my authority!"", and several satirical songs come to life (I really liked the SEXUAL HARASSMENT PANDA song - turn the volume up and you can hear the lyrics!).

1917237,5,B0000CABL2,"Simultaneously produced with the brilliant South Park feature film, the third season of South Park was when it was proof that the wildly irreverant show was here to stay.  Containing some of the series' most brilliant and hilarious episodes (including ""The Succubus"", ""Tweek VS Craig"", ""Starvin' Marvin in Space"", and ""Hooked on Monkey Phonics""), season 3 was comedic gold from it's premiere on.  The three episode ""Meteor Shower Party"" trilogy (all three episodes take place on the same night) is the highlight here: the first episode (""Cat Orgy"") focuses on Cartman trying to survive being babysat by Stan's sister Shelly, the second episode (""Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub"") finds Stan stuck in Mr. Mackey's basement while the drunken adults party upstairs, and the third episode (""Jewbilee"") finds Kyle and Kenny saving existence at a Jewish Scout meeting.  The band Korn also stops by in an episode spoofing the old Scooby-Doo cartoon, and Jennifer Aniston lends her voice in the season premiere.  This third season box set finally includes a commentary by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, which is itself a reason to own this set.",1082073600,,1138,5.037234042553192
1917238,4,B0000CABL2,"South Park fans have, no doubt, already seen the episodes from the third season and know if they like them or not.  If you like these episodes, this DVD gets right to them.  There are no corny introductions by Trey Parker and Matt Stone that were on the first two seasons.
I am not that crazy about the third season episodes (Jakovosaurs, for example, is one of the most annoying ones I've seen) but there are some gems: Rainforest Shmainforest takes a very different view of the save the rain forest movement (it includes Jennifer Aniston as Mrs. Stevens); Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub was part of a three part Meteor Shower night that follows each of the main characters on their individual adventure.  This part was the funnier of the three mostly because of the storyline that has Stan's dad and Kyle's dad ""experimenting"" in a hot tub.  Fans of Korn will enjoy the Scooby Doo take-off Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery.  Chinpoko Mon is one of my all time favorite South Park episodes. As one might guess, it is a take-off on the Pokemon craze only these Chinpoko Mon are the Japanese strategy for getting American children to fight against their own government.  The Red Badge of Gayness has Cartman leading drunken South Park residents in a Civil War reenactment that becomes all too real (the letter Gen. Cartman sends to Kenny's mom after her son's predictable death really makes this episode brilliant). ""Sally Struthers"" returns in Starvin' Marvin in Space which makes fun of the 700 Club.  The creators show their respect for Ronnie James Dio in Hooked On Monkey Phonics.  When I first heard one of my favorite metal singers was used in a South Park show, I was afraid they would make him look like a midget, but they didn't (although they made his speaking voice sound like an old lady).  The World Wide Recorder Concert may be my favorite South Park show of all time.  When I first saw it, tears were streaming down my face I was laughing so hard.  The South Park kids inadvertently add the ""brown noise"" note to the music 4 million third graders are playing which causes people across the world (was everyone supposed to be watching this event?) to, well, soil themselves.  The news reports after the incident are hilarious (shouldn't the reporters be wearing gas masks?).
As far as DVD ""extras"" go, I found the commentaries to be very lame.  If you choose the commentary option from the Set Up option on the menu, you hear Parker and Stone talk about an episode for a few minutes and then the rest of the show finishes as usual.  A lot of what they say is just a description of what the show is about which is nothing new to those who've seen the it.  The worst commentary is on Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus as much of it is about how they cannot remember what the last show of the season was.  In fact, a lot of their commentary is how they ""don't remember"" things. You'd think they would refresh their memory before doing a commentary that will be released and heard by millions of people or at least prepare something semi-interesting if they are only going to comment for a few minutes on each episode. Luckily, we're not forced to listen to them and can just enjoy the shows.",1081814400,,3201,4.53125
1917239,5,B0000CABL2,"While the first two seasons of ""South Park"" were certainly excellent, apparently they were just warmups for the sustained brilliance of Season 3.  I'll readily admit that I'm one of those sad people who rank seasons of TV shows, and this one is right up there with the classic fourth and fifth seasons of ""The Simpsons.""  The preceding seasons were victimized by a few duds, but this one is straight quality from beginning to end.  There was always a lot going on behind the adventures of Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, and it was here that the show's combination of boldness, wit, and heart was finally perfected.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone had already demonstrated an ability to crack up fans and offend decent people everywhere, but season 3 saw ""South Park"" really make the leap into proably the smartest and most sharply satirical show on TV.  After two seasons spent developing characters and honing their approach, the show's creators launched a full frontal assault on every aspect of life imaginable, and hit every target.  Commercialism, hypocrisy, political correctness, and popular stereotypes are all held up for ridicule, and no sacred cow is safe.  Since the 1999-2000 season was right around the time ""The Simpsons"" started running out of steam, it was the perfect opportunity for ""South Park"" step in as the new standard-bearer for irreverent humor.
It's obvious right off the bat that this season represents a step forward with the opening ""Rainforest Shmainforest,"" a sendup of environmental do-gooderism in which the boys and a well-meaning activist discover firsthand that the rainforest isn't all it's cracked up to be.  The unjustly neglected ""Sexual Harassment Panda"" presents a frightening, yet hilarious, vision of political correctness run amok in which everyone literally sues everyone else.  The deservedly famous (or is it infamous?) ""Chinpoko Mon"" offers more parody in 22 minutes than you might think possible, taking aim at Americans, Asians, consumerism and conformity while mocking the Pokemon trend of the late '90's.  ""The Red Badge of Gayness"" is a twisted modern re-imagining of the Civil War, with a Southern-accented Cartman leading a band of inebriated Confederate reenactors on a crusade to alter history and make slaves of Stan and Kyle.  And ""Are You There God?  It's Me, Jesus"" while insightfully examining the nature of religious belief in our times, also gives us a brutally hilarious image of Rod Stewart as a shriveled, incontinent geezer in a wheelchair who can do little more than groan at a much-hyped New Year's performance.
Parker and Stone had a few more great ideas up their sleeves, as well.  The consecutive episodes ""Cat Orgy,"" ""Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub,"" and ""Jewbilee"" all cover the same night from the perspectives of three different protagonists.  ""Hooked on Monkey Phonics"" sees two worlds colliding as Kyle falls for an innocent home-schooled girl, while ""Starvin' Marvin In Space"" reintroduces the title character at the same time as it takes a stab at religious zealotry.  And in one of the show's most memorable episodes, the concluding ""World Wide Recorder Concert,"" Cartman searches for a note that makes those who hear it lose control of their bowels, and Mr. Garrison confronts parental demons from his childhood that aren't quite what you might expect.
Animation has always had something that live-action TV lacks, and ""South Park"" is one show that provides convincing proof of that fact.  Without the constraints imposed by reality, Parker and Stone are free to explore just about any idea they can think of, and they obviously have plenty of them.  Despite its somewhat hefty price tag, this season is worth every penny.  Many of TV's finest moments are to be found here.",1081468800,4,3751,5.073170731707317

1917261,5,B0000CABL2,"SOUTHPARK is one of those shows that most people either love or hate.
It's easily misleading to the haters because it has so much profanity and gross bodily gestures, as well as stabs at anything Americans hold sacred (i.e. Church, liberties, etc).
During an interview, the creators made the comment that nothing could be held sacred in this series because that would have destroyed the spirit of their show.
The purpose of SOUTHPARK is sometimes satirical, and, this is one of the two levels of the show. On the base level, we've got the high school jokes and usual crude humor. For those who appreciate satire, there are deeper levels of meaning.
To understand SOUTHPARK, you have to understand that they lift ideas and themes from old movies, making fun of actors, celebrities and so forth. It would take forever to list the 30+ episodes but here are some of the top ones:
(1) SUCCUBUS: could it be true?  Has Chef found true love and changed his ways for good?  No way.  Instead, an evil succubus has turned him into a wuss and the boys have to race with the clock before the wedding takes place, casting Chef's soul into Hell;
(2) THE RED BADGE OF GAYNESS: the boys are doing a Civil War reenactment when Cartman makes a bet that he can get the Confederacy to win.  If they do, Stan and Kyle become his slaves for a year.  So, Cartman gets the Confederates drunk and the army marches all the way to Washington because Cartman hates Stan and Kyle ""so very much"".;
(3) MR. HANKEYE'S XMAS SPECIAL: more endearing that most xmas movies.  Look for xmas time in Hell and silver bells;
(4) KORN'S GROOVY PIRATE MYSTERY: a spoof on SCOOBY DOO mysteries with Korn as the mystery solvers.  Look for all the Cartman xmas songs, the Wonder Twins spoof and somoeone losing their glasses.;

(6) TWEEK VS. CRAIG: the boys bet who can win this fight.  Meanwhile, the teacher of welding tells them to ""Stop screwing around"" and has dramatic flashbacks of his deceased pilot wife.;
;
(8) ARE YOU THERE, GOD?  IT'S ME, JESUS: the son of God feels that the new millenium is his big chance to shoot up his polls.  The people of SOUTHPARK demand a sign so Jesus tells them that he's going to have a kick ass party with Rod Stewart in Las Vegas.  God also makes an appearance and looks nothing like you thought!; and
(9) JAKOVASAURS: a spoof on Jar Jar de Binks; an irritating lost race of duck like humanoids are found.  The last two.  Highly irritating that the whole town gives them an award to send them off to France.  Looks for lots of clumys antic a la Jar Jar de Binks.",1074124800,2,2559,4.484913793103448

1917278,4,B0000CABL2,"Let's get something straight...I have season 1 of this series already. What didn't I like about it? There were no 'chapter' selects...you had to fast forward through episodes to get to the scenes you liked in certain shows. The only chapter selects consisted of the episodes themselves. Well..season 3 fixes this problem, as there are a good amount of places for you to skip around through each show in. Also, the 'commentary-mini's' are great and informative, although you'd like them to last a couple minutes longer each one. Kudos to Paramount for doing what the brothers Warner couldn't, and that's pave the way for some 'sweet' DVD releases of South Park seasons that fan's can really enjoy.
  Season 3 works on many levels, it's strong, like the Simpsons season 3, in that it kind of paved the way for how the shows of the future would be, and it didn't rely on 'shock value', as it actually had funny and...fudged up moments in it that are well worth your time. I'm sure you know the shows are funny, and even the ones that aren't a 'hit' and are more 'miss'..rest assured theres at least one scene in every show that'll have you rolling on the floor. And as Trey says..if you have season 2..throw it away. Or as I say, sell it to someone and put it towards the purchase of South Park Season 3.
  I give this set 4 out of 5 stars because there could have been more extra's..but I'm a sucker for commentaries, and unlike most people that drone on and on about crap, the commentary-mini's are hilarious. Here's hoping for that Orgazmo Special Edition DVD that everone's waiting for. Now I'm gonna go eat some City Wok.",1072137600,3,1623,4.56701030927835
1917279,5,B0000CABL2,"South Park: The Complete Third Season is simply the best South Park DVD set available.  The quality of the animation, writing and just plain goofiness is leagues ahead of the first two seasons (even though both were excellent).  In season three, Trey Parker and Matt Stone make inspired swipes at: rainforest activists, Pat Robertson, home-schooled kids, pokemon, Jar-Jar Binks, Civil War reinactors, Yoko Ono and Sally Struthers (again).
The DVD packaging itself is fairly spartan in the tradition of the last two seasons.  The selling point this season is that Trey and Matt give commentaries for each episode (or as they aptly christened it ""commentary mini"".  The commentaries are short and sweet and many don't last much more than four minutes.  Some have criticized them for being to short, but I think that the critics miss the point.  Trey and Matt specifically said they didn't want any BS and just wanted to give some behind the scenes info and not bore the viewers with useless info for the whole 25 minutes.
The bottom line is this, if you are South Park fan, you simply cannot do without this great DVD set.",1071792000,5,1120,4.837696335078534
1917280,5,B0000CABL2,"There is some absolutely classic, can't miss stuff on this season of the greatest animated series ever. ""The Succubus"" is an often underrated episode that anyone that's ever been with a life sucking woman will undoubtedly love, and ""Mr Hankey's Christmas Classics"" have some of the funniest songs ever produced on the show(see the Dreidel Song(sp?)). Overall, not my absolute favorite season ever, but it is the best one that has come out on DVD so far, so if you liked the first two, you'll like this one also. And please, stop the whining about the ""mini-commentaries"" and how they've somehow ruined the DVDs. Matt and Trey have ALWAYS done things their way, and that's what makes South Park and almost all of their subsidiaries great comedy to those who ""get it"" and dispicable to those that don't. I, for one, get it. And I don't know if I'm right or wrong, but I personally think it'd be VERY boring to talk through an entire episode of south park, detailing frame-for-frame how and why they did what they did(not to mention that it'd be almost intolerable to listen to). And also, don't think that Trey and Matt somehow owe you anything for spending your money on this, cuz they don't. The only thing that they owe you is to produce quality shows, cuz if and when the time comes that they don't, I'm sure that South Park's ""loyal"" fans will have no problem bolting on them. So get over yourselves if you actually believe they owe you or any other South Park fan something for buying this.",1071705600,3,1494,4.599250936329588
1917281,4,B0000CABL2,"this is a good dvd. i just bought it and i cant stop laughing. this is one of the funniest shows of all time. along with family guy, beavis and butt-head, simpsons futurama, king of th hill all those shows like that. the thing with this dvd is its from paramount dvd, so it has commentary from matt and trey. the thing is that is the only special feature, like behind the scenes you know the making of it or at least a music video from chef or something like that. and its 17 episodes and only 3 disc. not thats bad or anything its just that when i heard it was 17 episodes, i thought it was gonna be like 4 disc or something like that. but other than all those things its pretty good.",1071532800,,685,4.044117647058823

Its me Jesus, Three Guys in a hot tub, and MANY MORE. The mini commentaries will be good. And to the other reviewer on this page who said that ""every single episode should have full length commentary"" I say, wishfull thinking, BUT NO. Stone and Parker as so rich, it doesnt matter if they release the episodes alone or with commentaries and deleted scenes ETC.",1070668800,,485,4.586206896551724

7998469,4,B0000CABL2,"It's a pretty great season.  I grew up with the show so in a way it's nice to see these old episodes again.  WARNING though, if you're expecting this to come in the nice cardboard box case most of the other seasons come in, you're going to have a bad time.  This came in the thin plastic DVD case which is fine but the cardboard box ones look cool and just feel more premium (which is obviously nice).
That being said, great season; lame packaging.  Worth buying.",1505520000,,463,4.287356321839081
