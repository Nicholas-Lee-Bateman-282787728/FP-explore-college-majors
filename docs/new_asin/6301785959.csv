7815589,5,6301785959,"Saw this when it first came out, then saw it again on either HBO or Cinemax back around 1983. I loved the humor. I taped it off one of those cable movie channels, lost that tape then found it at a Blockbuster, never returned the tape, moved several times over the years, lost that tape..now looking for a DVD. Impossible. iTunes doesn't even have the movie..oh sure, they have the soundtrack (great soundtrack btw) but no movie.

So..the search continues..",1458172800,,456,4.7

7815591,4,6301785959,I was hoping this movie was going to showcase the actress who played Mrs. Kotter. The good news is the VHS was in very good condition but the main character needed a good therapist to let him see all the good he had in his life. Great price!,1384214400,,241,4.041666666666667
7815592,5,6301785959,"I saw this movie in the 80's and laughed till I cried.  Yes, it's quite dated but anyone who was a young adult in the 70's or 80's would get a tremendous kick out of it.  It's both charming and hysterical.",1357171200,,205,3.975609756097561
7815593,4,6301785959,"I WANT A DVD OF THIS!! Very funny comedy, reminds me of self, always eating soup for one, always chasing women of my dreams, haven't found nada yet! ...Peace.",1277164800,3,158,4.482758620689655
7815594,5,6301785959,"Folks, this is not Oscar-worthy cinema, but it is a fun flick, especially for those who want to take a peek at the way things used to be. The music is incredible, and the story is nothing more than a romantic comedy set in its time. In this day and age, I have tried to watch plenty of awful films that would make this look like movie of the year. In fact, if this came out on DVD, I probably would order it and give it to my friends.

If you are a nostalgic person who LOVES the music of Chic, you will enjoy this movie. I know my wife and I had a good laugh with it during our Christmas holiday together.",1223769600,4,606,3.926829268292683
7815595,1,6301785959,"This movie follows my observation that a good soundtrack album (unfortunately, no longer in print) means that the movie itself is poor.
The story of single life in Manhattan pretty much ends up where it started, with Saul Rubinek's character searching for the meaning of love and almost getting married, but still doesn't know where he's going.
In the meantime, the tale goes from the bizzarre (he literally rows away from a bad date) to the tacky (a singles weekend in the Adarondaks), but leaves the viewer wondering why he wasted 1 1/2 hours of his time with an uneven, unresolved, somewhat depressing story.  Seeing Marcia Straussman (better known as Julie Kotter) utter the F-word a couple times doesn't help things, either.",976579200,2,729,4.975409836065574
7815596,3,6301785959,"When I think of movies that fit together, Soup for One, The Personals,Eating Raoul,Ky. Fried Movie and The Groove Tube make for a perfect fit. What do you think? While the last three are more famous and  easier to find, I feel the first two should get a good look from comedy  lovers who enjoy comedy about dating do's and dont's and just being single  in a large city. An hour and a half well spent.",944956800,8,400,4.2368421052631575
