6866169,5,B00QAE26MU,"Awesome move that teaches friendships, loyalty and how to measure one's beauty, very good for the entire family, and of course it is a awesome about how a horse knows your soul and responds.",1425945600,2,190,4.617647058823529
6866170,5,B00QAE26MU,Very good family movie.  Love when kathy goes off to horse camp and meets Lisa.  I thought everything was going to turn out very good for the two of them.  In the end it all came out as it should have.  Kathy won the queen of horse camp that she gave up to Lisa and Stacy lost out on it but still gained a very good friend in Kathy.,1425254400,2,332,3.7681159420289854

6866172,2,B00QAE26MU,"It wasn't a total waste of my time, but it wasn't great. I'm glad I rented it from Amazon rather than buy it.

The story is a stereotypical coming of age and camp story. Shy girl grows into herself and finds friends. Camp has that ""mean girl"" pack to overcome. Nothing special or new here.

The good: Most of the movie looks good for an indie film. Most of the acting is pretty good, if a bit cheesy and over the top. The camp is pretty, the horses are great. The friendship with the main character and friend feels genuine.

The bad:
There's A LOT of montage (aka pointless filler) shots of the camp with annoyingly cheery children songs playing that are horribly boring and long. Teens watching might find the music reduces it from something they would enjoy as a nostalgia movie to more of a kids movie, but kids might enjoy it. I wouldn't really consider this movie an adult movie in any sense. Save it for family time. Most of the montage like shots are blurry (kind of defeats the point of doing an HD rental, there's some other blur issues too). It feels like half the movie at least is just promo shots for the camp.

Speaking of sound, the music is very loud, the talking is quiet compared. Which is annoying to constantly be turning the volume up and down.

Camera focus shifts from characters in the back to the front when talking indoors and it gets distracting.

There is also a lot of consistency and quality issues. When introducing the main character to the camp it randomly cuts to two girls introducing where things are in the camp in a completely different place with no explanation. They are on screen for about ten seconds and it cuts back. No explanation and you never see them again. It almost looks like an accident.

In the campfire singing scene the voices are very quiet and the consoler is very loud. Then you see why as the microphone and a camera tripod are in the shot.

A coffee cup appears randomly on a fence.

You can see shadows of the movie crew very obviously in some shots.

So if you have a kids who likes horses, they might enjoy it. Or if you went to a horse camp and want to relive some nostalgia memories, you might find it tolerable. But I would recommend a rental. it's pretty forgettable and I personally won't be watching it again.",1424736000,5,2279,4.404761904761905
6866173,5,B00QAE26MU,"I enjoy all types of films, but it's always nice to be able to find a worthwhile title for the entire family, including the kids! While ""Horse Camp"" may be oriented at the female population, the boys should enjoy it too - the really young ones will probably be more interested in the horses and the older boys will be taking more than a few looks at the nice-looking teen girls in the movie!

Overall, though, a thought-provoking story with a very satisfying ending.",1422230400,2,466,4.5476190476190474

6866183,3,B00QAE26MU,"Lisa, Cathy's friend, was an excellent actress. Overall, the movie was slow. Cathy was continually rewarded for her bad behavior and for breaking the rules.",1438214400,2,156,5.28
6866184,5,B00QAE26MU,"A movie that all teenage girls should watch. Excellent portrayal of what peer pressure can do and how to deal with it. Also good for those who have been the victims of peer pressure. And if your teen girl likes horses it is a double benefit. Only down side is that there are VERY few people who can advance in their riding skills the way that the lead character is shown to do. It still takes practise, practise, practise!",1437177600,5,422,4.3544303797468356

6866187,1,B00QAE26MU,"I can't believe how bad this movie was.  I bought it for my 10 year old daughter who loves horses, but even she could barely get through the movie because it was so bad.  The plot was cheesy enough, but the acting was truly terrible, especially the girl who played Stacy.  I can't believe I spent money on this movie.  Hire real actors!",1434240000,,336,4.285714285714286

6866193,5,B00QAE26MU,"This is another touching movie written , directed and produced by Joel Reisig.  I have been a fan of his ever since his first release, ""FRATERNITY HOUSE""  He has continually touched the viewer with a message of social impact.  It is just a matter of time before he will become a household name. He puts out a VERY top notch product.",1427328000,,332,4.409836065573771
6866194,1,B00QAE26MU,Really hard to imagine these girls being as old as they were in this. It's s story line for maybe 6-8 year old kids. It's saddle club for younger kids,1426896000,4,150,4.033333333333333

8690970,5,B00QAE26MU,"I am dumber for having watched this movie.  It was so bad, my wife and I couldn't stop watching.  It was kinda like watching a train wreck; you don't want to see it, but at the same time, you can't look away.  I'm pretty sure much of it was filmed on an iphone (for real).  The dialogue and script were so cheesy- I'm almost positive I saw a horse roll it's eyes in one of the scenes.  That said, 5 stars because we 'Mystery Science Theater'd' through the whole thing and got a good laugh.",1506297600,3,489,4.105263157894737
8690971,5,B00QAE26MU,"This is a REAL PLACE and now my daughter spends two weeks each summer in Michigan experiencing this place. Black River in Lexington, MI.
it is a fairy tale place that is real. The movie is, well, B quality, but kids don't care. They love the girl drama and the horses.",1500076800,2,268,4.2745098039215685
8690972,2,B00QAE26MU,"The movie and story are great, being a BR girl myself.  It is such a fun movie to watch!  Acting quality is to be as expected.  However, our DVD glitched throughout and also only came on in black and white, even though the case said full color.  That was very disappointing and made it frustrating to watch.",1497830400,,307,4.333333333333333
