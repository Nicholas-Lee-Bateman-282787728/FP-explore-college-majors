7984659,5,B00008J2HE,This show may be one of the best shows on earth.  Jessy James IS the master fabricator.  The fighting in between the build team realy makes the show interesting.  I recomend buying this DvD,1102636800,3,189,4.5

7984661,5,B00008J2HE,"This DVD set is a lot of fun.  It has 4 episodes only better: they don't have commercials.  The four include Switchblade (Mustang 5.0 lawnmower), Fire Truck (Limousine Fire Truck), Trash Truck (Ford Explorer Trash Mover), and the Swamp Buggy (VW Bug Swamp Boat).  Lots of fun, worth the money!!",1062720000,13,294,4.84
