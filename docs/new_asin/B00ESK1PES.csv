pleasure to watch, good cast, good story line,most entertaining - .",1400457600,8,461,4.597560975609756
8608937,5,B00ESK1PES,"Season seven has the doctors and son working to put crime out of business.  The episodes run the gamut of old comics delivering bad jokes to Doctor Wesley (Joanna Cassidy) incurring the wrath of a crazed killer bent on revenge.  In between, Doctor Travis (Charlie Schlatter) loses his girlfriend offscreen, Doctor Bentley (Victoria Rowell) adopts another son, Doctor Sloan (Dick Van Dyke) continues to sing and dance whether anyone wants him to or not, and son Steve buys a killer home.  Basically, its just more of the same.  If you like the series, this one falls right in line with the rest.",1518912000,,594,4.794117647058823

I was never able to fast forward over the bad spot in the disk.  The other episodes on Disk 5 were satisfactory.  This was a ""used like new"" seventh season of Diagnosis Murder.  Still the other 23 episodes were very entertaining and worth the money.",1477353600,,379,4.651515151515151
