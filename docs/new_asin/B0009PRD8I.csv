8208166,5,B0009PRD8I,"We read The Mouse and the Motorcycle & Runaway Ralph every year in my class. I usually have to rent the movies. This year they no longer had them at the video stores. I was so happy to find them on Amazon.  My class just loves them. They are  not exactly like the books but they are very close. The mouse is very cute riding on the little cycle. Sweet , clean movie where the kids must pay attention to the story. Nothing gross or hyper like movies these days. A little old fashion. They love it and so do I. It's a great way to end a Ralph unit.",1120521600,4,546,3.9545454545454546
