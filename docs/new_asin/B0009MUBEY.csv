2301609,5,B0009MUBEY,"Don't be wrong. This is the second part of the TV series ""Karol: A Man Who Became Pope"". If the first part is very good, inspirational, it doesn't matter if you are or not catholic, the history of this Pope is a mandatory reference to both centuries, the 20th and 21th. This movie begins when karol became John Paul II. The music.....aaaah, the music was composed for Ennio Morricone....if you enjoy the music of The Mission, you will love this soundtrack.",1158883200,18,456,4.6419753086419755
2301610,5,B0009MUBEY,"The movie depicts the life of Pope John Paul II since he was a student in Polan during WWII.  It presents in great detail, how JPII fought both the Nazi regime and the Rusian comunist regime with love and how he used that love to gain respect from his followers and enemies, which eventually lead him to Rome,making him one of the yougest popes in history of the Catholic church.",1156636800,7,379,4.414285714285715
2301611,5,B0009MUBEY,"This movie portraits a young Karol Wojtyla and the struggles and circumstances he and his close friends and family lived during WWII in Poland. Finding his vocation as a priest and following God's plan for his life he becomes bishop, cardinal and eventually Pope. The acting is absolutely wonderful.  I recommend this movie to all catholics and non-catholics alike.",1154908800,5,365,5.186440677966102
2301612,5,B0009MUBEY,"I saw this movie on cable and was inspired. I'm glad quality copies are now available for purchase. This is a film I've watched again and again and shared with others because of the strength, courage, and compassion of Karol Wojtyla.",1151971200,5,233,4.7073170731707314
2301613,5,B0009MUBEY,"Wonderful movie, great for the whole family, even my 9 year old son was really into it.  Captures the essence of how John Paul II transformed the world with love and understanding.

I strongly recommend this movie, may need some paper tissue.",1151280000,6,242,4.738095238095238
2301614,4,B0009MUBEY,"This biopic is well done, true to life in terms of sets and costumes. This is no amateur production. The principal actors themselves are Polish: Piotr Adamczyk played Karol Wojtyla and Malgorzata Bela played leading lady, a platonic love never consumated. Obviously, there were some liberties taken here, but they do not detract much from the known trajectory of the Pope's life.

Adamczyk plays a convincing Wojtyla, reacting with profound emotions and absorption to every evil he sees. This is consontant with Wojtyla's phenomenological leanings. He was able to capture the late Pope's penetrating gaze and ample smile.

Main bad guys: Matt Craven, who played Hans Frank, Poland's Nazi governor and Hristo Shopov, whose name has been grievously omitted from the Cast Biographies and the Media Kit available from the distributor's website. We all know Shopov: he played Pontius Pilate in the Passion of the Christ. The guy has a nack to play evil dudes. In this movie, he played a Polish Communist apparatchik who tries to capture Wojtyla in a fumble that would justify his arrest, but can't.

Supporting cast: Raoul Bova played Father Thomasz Zaleski, pastor of Wawel Cathedral in Cracow and a mentor of young Karol. Zaleski lost his life at the whim of Governor Hans Frank. Ennio Fantasthichini played Nowak, a mine worker Wojtyla befriended while working at the Solway quarry who became a lifelong friend and mentor of sorts. There are more, but these are the ones I have the most information for the moment. I want to say that no secondary character was wasted in this movie; all of them contributed actively to the setting, to the environment, and to the pathos of the movie.

The script: In my opinion, perhaps the one thing that could have been improved. Sometimes the character appear to be delivering one-liners that sort of ""cruise"" past the other. In his more pedagogic moments, Wojtyla seems to be delivering straight quotes from the Pope's own works: _Love and Responsibility_ and _The Acting Person_. Adamski's delivery of these lines is magisterial and saves the day. He was able to integrate seamlessly them into a normal dialogue.

If the late Pope was like this, no wonder he is so beloved!",1149984000,5,2209,4.975609756097561
2301615,5,B0009MUBEY,"I would think the best words used to describe this movie were expressed by Pope Benedict XVI:

ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS BENEDICT XVI
AT THE VIEWING OF A FILM
ON THE LIFE OF POPE JOHN PAUL II

Thursday, 19 May 2005

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

I am certain to interpret the common sentiments and express living gratitude to those who wanted to offer me and all of you the opportunity to view this moving film tonight; it traces the life of young Karol Wojtya, leading to his election as the Pontiff known as ""John Paul II"".

I greet and thank Cardinal Roberto Tucci for his introduction to the film. I then address a word of admiration to the director and writer, Giacomo Battiato, and to the actors, especially Piotr Adamczyk who played the part of John Paul II, to the producer Pietro Valsecchi and to the networks ""Taodue"" and ""Mediaset"".

I cordially greet the other Cardinals, Bishops, priests, Authorities and all those who wanted to take part in this viewing in honour of the beloved Pontiff, recently deceased. We all remember him with deep affection and heartfelt gratitude. Yesterday, he would have celebrated his 85th birthday.

""Karol, un uomo diventato Papa"" [Karol, a man who became Pope] is the title of the drama, taken from a text by Gian Franco Svidercoschi. The first segment, as we have seen, highlights the situation in Poland under the Nazi regime, with emphasis - now and then very emotionally strong - given to the repression of the Polish people and to the genocide of the Jews. These are atrocious crimes that show all of the evil that was contained in the Nazi ideology.

Young Karol, shocked by so much suffering and violence, decided to do something about it in his own life, answering the divine call to the priesthood. The film presents scenes and episodes that, in their severity, awaken in the viewers an instinctive ""turning away"" in horror and stimulates them to consider the abyss of iniquity that can be hidden in the human soul.
At the same time, calling to the fore such aberration revives in every right-minded person the duty to do what he or she can so that such inhuman barbarism never happens again.

Today's viewing takes place just some days after the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. On 8 May 1945 the conclusion was marked of that frightful tragedy which sowed destruction and death, in a measure never-before heard of, in Europe and in the world.

Ten years ago, John Paul II wrote that World War II appears with evermore clarity as a ""suicide of humanity"". Each time a totalitarian ideology crushes man, humanity as a whole is seriously threatened. With the passing of time, memories do not have to fade; rather, they must be a stern lesson for this and future generations. We have the responsibility of reminding especially youth of the forms of unprecedented violence that can lead to contempt for men and women and the violation of their rights.

Under the light of Providence, how can we not read as a divine plan the fact that on the Chair of Peter, a Polish Pope is succeeded by a citizen of that Country, Germany, where the Nazi regime was the most vicious, attacking the nearby nations, Poland among them?

In their youth, both of these Popes - even if on opposing fronts and in different situations - knew the cruelty of the Second World War and of the senseless violence of men fighting men, people fighting people.

During the final days of the Second Vatican Council held here in Rome, the Polish Bishops consigned the ""letter of reconciliation"" to the German Bishops; the letter contained those famous words that today too resound in our souls: ""We forgive and we ask forgiveness"".

In last Sunday's Homily I reminded the newly-ordained priests that ""nothing can improve the world if evil is not overcome. Evil can be overcome only by forgiveness"" (L'Osservatore Romano English Edition, 18 May, p. 7). May the mutual and sincere condemnation of Nazism, as with atheistic communism, be everyone's duty for the building of reconciliation and peace on forgiveness.

""To forgive"", our beloved John Paul II again reminds us, ""does not mean to forget"", adding that ""if memory is the law of history, forgiveness is the power of God, the power of Christ that works in the vicissitudes of man"" (cf. Insegnamenti di Giovanni Paolo II, XVII/2 [1994], p. 250). Peace is, in the first place, a gift of God, who makes sentiments of love and solidarity arise in the heart of the person who welcomes it.

I hope that, thanks also to this witness of Pope John Paul II commemorated in this meaningful film, there will be a revival on the part of each person in the proposal to work - each in his or her own field and according to one's means - at the service of a definite action for peace in Europe and in the entire world.

I entrust the hope of peace that all of us carry in our heart to the maternal intercession of the Virgin Mary, who is venerated especially in this month of May. May she, Queen of Peace, encourage the generous contribution of those who intend to put their efforts toward the building of true peace on the solid pillars of truth, justice, freedom and love. With these sentiments, I extend to all my Apostolic Blessing.

-- POPE BENEDICT XVI

2301616,5,B0009MUBEY,"I was born and raised in Warsaw Poland. I was 8 years old when Karol Wojtyla became Pope John Paul II. He was all what I new until he passed away last year. I will never forget his words:

""I plead with you-never,ever give up on hope, never doubt, never tire, and never become discouraged. Be not afraid. Do not forget that true love sets no conditions; it does not calculate

or complain, but simply loves"". His love to God, Poland and all people was tremendous. He thought us how to forgive and go on.

This movie shows the fundaments of his faith and how it all happened. It is very emotional picture. It is 3 hours long but worth watching every minute of it.",1143849600,116,662,4.28
2301617,3,B0009MUBEY,"Karol Wojtyla was deeply influenced by the events of the Second World War, or rather, the German invasion/occupation of his native Poland, to be more specific. That's the reason why this film is called what it is; as it tries to convey how the man himself was ""made"" by a particular historical era into the man the world has since come to know.  If you are looking for an all encompassing 'Life of John Paul II' this isn't the film for you. (See ""Witness to Hope"" on DVD for that, and/or read George Weigel's biography of Pope John Paul II by that same title.) Roughly half of this presentation concerns the era in which World War Two was fought, leaving not much time to address the half century of this man's service that followed. In many ways, thus, this film is very much a window into Nazi-occupied Poland; a film that one could usefully watch along with ""The Wannsee Conference,"" ""Schindler's List,"" and others. On that level it is a fine film indeed. Piotr Adamczyk, the actor who portays the future pope, moreover, handles the role with remarkable aplomb.  As the story of ""The Man who became Pope,"" however, this film suffers from some very serious shortcomings. In the film pivotal scenes, for instance, are portrayed by a ""Father Tomasz Zaleski,"" who plays Karol's close friend of many years---his spiritual advisor even; a man we ultimately see get shot by a Nazi firing squad. Too bad all this is, in George Weigel's words, ""a complete invention. Young Karol Wojtyla did have a spiritual director, Father Kazimierz Figliewicz, but Figliewicz was not his contemporary and was not shot by the Germans, "" Weigel has written. Karol's relationship with ""Hania,"" in real life the Polish actress Halina Krolikiewicz Kwiatkowska, is also doctored. A close friend of Karol, she is portrayed as kept in the dark by his decision to join the priesthood (seemingly belied by the fact that he was very open about this with friends supposedly); who then doesn't marry for 7 years---seemingly to imply something here. But she actually married soon thereafter. And her first child was later (1946) baptized by Father Karol. And lastly, to quote Weigel again: ""The filmmakers also invent a member of a Wojtyla youth group who is really working for the SB, the secret police. This is not only a total fabrication; it's an insult to the men and women who were, in fact, Karol Wojtyla's closest lay friends, and whose networks were certainly not penetrated by Polish intelligence."" But the film adds the fictional priest above, the hint of romantic relations that didn't exist, and---for added measure---some espionage spice that no evidence exists to support. To reiterate: The film is well done and does convincingly convey the spirit of the future John Paul II. Just don't take all the details of the story presented herein as gospel should you choose to view this film along with ""Witness to Hope.""  God Bless",1143331200,134,2906,4.843058350100604

Both DVD's were the best and most accurate depiction of his life from other biographies and documentaries I have read and seen.

2301694,4,B0009MUBEY,"I bought this film as I wished to know more about Pope John Paul 2nd. In 1993 to 1995 I lived in Lublin, Poland, where the Karol once worked. Many people spoke with great affection about the man, who would one day become Pope. Seeing this film on DVD I was intrigued with who and what made this man.

The film is 3 hours long. It is a great biopic of the man, but I feel it dwells too much on his early life in the war. Over 1 hour is spent on this period and only 10 minutes on him becoming Pope. I would have liked a little more about his Papal election. This election was controversial, yet is passed over very quickly. There is no analysis of why he was chosen or the Geo Political earthquake his election help create. I also think some more analysis of the time he was Arch Bishop of Nova Hoota would have been appropriate. For many Poles the period he spent negotiating and building this Church against State opposition is what made him a legend in Poland, long before he was elected Pope.

It is also obvious that this is a made for TV film, and does suffer from some very poor special effects.

If you accept the short comings of this film and just enjoy learning something about this GREAT man, then the film is worth watching. With better editing and some greater focus on the two highlighted areas, I feel it would have warranted 5 stars.

Great film, but lacks some focus in two important areas.",1375747200,,1407,4.2781954887218046

To the see the people John Paul the Great grew-up with and the people who endured the struggles with him see him as he's being introduced as Pope chokes me up everytime I watch this movie.  I especially enjoy the scene which shows the moment when Wojtyla the priest, who was not even thought-of as a candidate when conclave began after John Paul I's death, get put forth as a candidate.  It is an exceptionally powerful scene to a priest from Communist occupied Poland as he's elected Pope  -an advertent or inadvertent message from the College of Cardinals against communism and totalitarianism as depicted when Kordek (head of the Communist in Poland toasts Wojtyla as he's introduced as Pope ...love that scene!

This biographical dvd also demonstrates the difficulties he had with the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and his acceptance of this disease and how he lived out his life as richly and fully as he could.

2301773,4,B0009MUBEY,"I wanted to see this film because Karol Wojtyla/Pope John Paul II was a major figure in 20th-Century history, and a fascinating person in his own right.  Being Jewish, I also wanted to see how the film would treat the Polish Pope's early life in Poland during the Holocaust, and whether or not it would deal with the Catholic Church's overall silence with respect to the Holocaust.

The film is emotionally compelling and engrossing.  An amazingly talented Polish actor, Piotr Adamczyk, portrays Karol Wojtyla as a gifted, compassionate young student/budding artist who decides to devote his life to the priesthood in response to the horrors he witnessed and experienced during the Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland.  The film disproportionately highlights and celebrates the ""Righteous Gentiles"" among Wojtyla's college friends; while it is very likely true that a Polish intellectual in his early 20's during the late 1930's probably socialized exclusively with fellow Poles who were not anti-Semitic, the film ignores and eliminates by avoidance the huge problem of endemic anti-Semitism throughout Polish culture.

Thus, the film is intrinsically biased in favor of showing Polish Catholicism particularly, and the Catholic Church in general, as innocent, when history shows that it is not.  I think this is understandable, but it is an obvious bias and should be taken into account when viewing.

Overall, the film is a very fine work of art, and the performance of Piotr Adamczyk really brings the character of Karol Wojtyla to life.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in understanding major figures in 20th/21st century world history, but would caution them to keep in mind the vested interests involved in the making of the film.",1238630400,3,1758,5.209219858156028

2301776,5,B0009MUBEY,"I ordered this film from Canada because you can't get the second part in the UK and it was totally worth while. The Pope, The man is wonderful and a little more accurate than A Man Who became Pope which took liberties with the early part of JP's life. I was profoundly moved by many aspects of both films-I will treasure this DVD.

Both films are a beautiful, moving tribute to a man who taught love and practiced what he preached. I think they are wonderfully acted by the title roles- I cannot recommend them highly enough. Pope Benedict himself gave them a favourable review but you don't need to be Catholic, Christian or even religious to recognise the goodness of JPII and see the gift he had with people- especially youth.

This film captures the essence of who Karol was and what motivated him in a time of oppression and fear. It puts the message of John Paul's papacy 'DO NOT BE AFRAID' into a new light when you see how hard he must have struggled not to let fear conquer him in his life.

In 'KAROL; THE POPE, THE MAN' the actors reprise their roles - Piotr Adamczyk is utterly superb in portraying the Pope to the point of his death. This young actor really does deserve praise. Together these are truly great films that inspire and uplift like the man himself.

I hope as many people as possible get the chance to enjoy them",1234483200,25,1338,4.4048582995951415
2301777,5,B0009MUBEY,"This is another excellent movie depicting the turbulent teen and adult years of a most loved Pope.  The acting is superb and the audience gets an idea of how bad Europe was during that period of time.  The movie is easy to watch, understand and enjoy.  It depicts a young, athletic and fun loving man surving through many challenges.  While catholicism and faith is certainly an undetone throughout the movie, it is not overdone.  The main focus is the determination and warmth of a young man who would one day become the leader of the Roman Catholic family and become highly respected throughout the world.",1218240000,3,607,4.742857142857143

2301779,5,B0009MUBEY,"This is an engaging and intense three hour movie about the life of Karol Wojtyla (played by Piotr Adamczyk) and his struggles against the evils of Nazism and Communism which occupied Poland for 50 years.
We witness the brutality of the Communists and Nazis, of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against both Poles and Jews and the iron fisted tyranny of Communist rule.
All this as the background of the life of a man truly committed to faith, peace and justice.
It shows footage of the bombing of Poles fleeing the Nazis, murders of Jews in the Krakow ghetto and the shooting by Communist authorities of peaceful Polish protesters.
I see no moral difference between Communists and Nazis.
It also shows the development of Karol Wojtyla's faith and his influence on all whom he came across, including his friendship with actress  Halina Krolikiewicz Kwiatkowska (Magorzata Bela), the  influence from his mentor Priest Tomasz Zaleski (Raoul Bova) and how he helped several Jews to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland.
It depicts his defiance of the Communist regime of Poland and their persecution by him, and his surveilance by communist agents.
It is heavy, intense but ultimately uplifting viewing about the triumph and freedom of the human spirit and faith.",1216339200,3,1271,5.018957345971564

There is a second part that is soon to come out in DVD called ""Karol:  The Pope who remained a man"" which portrays the papacy of JPII.  This movie shows his early life culminating in his election to the papacy in 1978.  It has brilliant international actors who play their parts superbly like Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate from ""The Passion of the Christ"") who plays a major part as the Communist agent who persecuted Karol Wojtyla for many years and Raoul Bova (who brilliantly plays the future Pope's brave friend and priest during World War II).  If one really wants to understand Poland under Nazi and Communist occupation and understand how Karol Wojtyla developed his vocation, this is the movie to watch.

It chronicles his life in Poland during World War II and the Soviet Communism following. I saw the movie with my grandmother who was about the Pope's age about 50 kilometers from the site when Poland was attacked during the war and she thought the movie conveyed the times pretty realistically. Actually, that is also what she said she didn't like about the movie because it brought her back to the times she didn't want to go back to. As for me, the younger generation (I am in my early 20s), the movie was emotional, dramatic and involving. It is hard to believe it was someone's real life because it really reads more like fiction. The acting was great as well. Note: I have only watched this movie in Polish so it may be a different experience watching a version dubbed in English or with English subtitles.",1177200000,5,931,4.450292397660819
2301787,5,B0009MUBEY,"Although fitting a mainstream audience, 'Karol: A Man Who Became Pope,' has to be one of the greatest movies in Catholic cinema.  Taking the life of Pope John Paul II (featuring Polish actor Piotr Adamczyk) from the Nazi invasion of Poland to his rise to the papacy, 'Karol...' clocks in at 3:06 without a wasted scene.  The acting is decent to solid, and there are enough threads throughout to create a seamless presentation.  Relationships are focused upon clearly while the story weaves its way through the ordeal and horror of Nazi occupation to the decades of communism until the man who said, ""Evil will devour itself,"" becomes that self-fulfilling prophecy.

Familiar to most people, not just Catholics, the story is a study in resiliency, a witness to a spirit that isn't broken--even in the direst of circumstances.  The highlights include his relationships with Jewish friends, his underground actor days, his eventual embrace of priesthood, and his scholarly and ecclesial roles as they develop.  At the forefront are history defining moments that swirl around the main protagonist.  Always authentic, never dull, and stirring without a shred of sentimentality, 'Karol:  A Man Who Became Pope' is a master portrait of a man and his flock over time.",1172620800,10,1259,5.107317073170732
