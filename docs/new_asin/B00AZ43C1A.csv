5528946,5,B00AZ43C1A,"The legacy of the Holocaust continues to loom today like an obscene cloud of ash, not unlike the ones that blighted so much of concentration camp-plagued Europe during World War II. Countless stories, many yet to be told, are the dismal reminder of one of humanitys greatest shames.

We seek out and tell these stories because they help us to understand the pastvery much in the hope that the mistake which led to this moral canker may never happen again. In that sense, each new tale is to be welcomed.

In the case of the story of Petr Ginz, this story is not only to be welcomed, it is to be applauded.

A good starting point in appreciating the genius of Petr Ginz might be to imagine the childhood of Leonardo Da Vinci. The comparison is appropriate, yet well never know the full extent of this complement in large part because Petr Ginzs remarkable life was cut short by the madness of genocide.

Any life lost by such vile means is a tragedy, but a life so rich with talent, innovation andheres that word againgenius, is doubly tragic.

The filmmakers embrace the story of Petr Ginz not as a tragedy, but as a glorious triumph of the human, specifically the artistic, spirit over oppression and tyranny.

Mining Petrs extensive drawings and paintings (and writings) to tell the story of the Holocaust is a brilliant approach. To extend their impact by animating them and using them as the springboard for additional artwork is a stroke of genius in its own right.

THE LAST FLIGHT OF PETR GINZ captures young Petrs brilliance by replicating his far-reaching imagination and bringing itand, to an extent, himto life.

See this film. You won't forget it. The story of Petr Ginz is a tragedy, to be sure, but it transcends its inherent sorrow by reminding us all of the life-affirming importance of artistic expression.

One more thing, the phenomenal score for this film is an outstanding work of art in its own right. Most documentaries, of necessity, feature small-scale musical scores that reflect a limited budgetthe use of electronic instruments or small ensembles. Not here. Here we have a symphonic sore of crushing poignancy, ethereal bliss and percussive bite. With any luck, a soundtrack CD will be available soon.

Bravo.",1397433600,5,2237,4.802083333333333

5528949,5,B00AZ43C1A,"There are no words to express how much I was moved by this film. We had the good fortune to view the film within the context of a service to remember the millions killed by the Nazis and those who fought in the resistance (Yom HaShoah v'ha-Gveurah), which just added to the movie's depth, creativity, and meaning. The filmmakers have done a brilliant job at telling the story of Petr Ginz and giving honor to his artwork and stories. He was clearly an exceptional young man and sadly another example of what the world could have been had he survived. Who knows the gifts we all could have enjoyed... Alas, we are left with his pictures and thankfully people who tell the story inspired by his art and which will inspire you as well.",1367366400,3,732,4.470149253731344
5528950,5,B00AZ43C1A,"This documentary is different.  It tells a familiar story - the genocide by the Nazis - but it tells it using a cinematic tradition that does not immediately dance together: Genocide and Animation.  The story of the documentary is perhaps all too familiar.  It is quite likely that there were others like Petr, but their work is neither preserved nor celebrated.  The makers of this documentary corrected that flaw - they found the works of Petr and celebrated it.  I know the people who were the creative energy behind this, I had the good fortune of negotiating their arrival to Wake Forest.  While that immediately stinks of collusion in review, I would say only one thing - watch the documentary.  If after that, you do not conjure up words such as ""brilliant"" ""OMG"" and ""TIFG (e-mail me if you do not know what this means: Ananda@wfu.edu) then you are really missing the point.  Watch this documentary if you need to see how creativity intersects with history to present the reality of a child's life using imagery that the child created.  Cara, Cindy, Sandy - Bravo!  This is from Ananda Mitra, not sure why Amazon is attributing this to another name!!!!",1366156800,3,1160,4.755
5528951,5,B00AZ43C1A,"""The Last Flight of Petr Ginz"" is a compelling documentary that chronicles the brief life of Holocaust victim, Petr Ginz. Back in 2003, when space shuttle Columbia was preparing for its 28th mission, Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon wished to take something from the Holocaust on board with him and Yad Vashem gave him a drawing of Earth from space as imagined by Petr Ginz, who drew it when he was 14-years-old while being incarcerated at Terezin concentration camp during WW II. Petr's sister, Eva Ginz Pressburger (who lives in Israel), thinks it is fitting that her brother finally got to go to space as he once wished.

When the space shuttle disintegrated upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the publicity led to the discovery of Petr's diary in a Prague attic.

The format of this documentary is wonderfully imaginative in piecing together Petr's life story. In a wonderful blend of animation, interviews with Petr's sister, and archival materials such as video footage and of course, excerpts from Petr's diary as well as his drawings, viewers get to develop a deeper understanding of the time period as witnessed and recorded by Petr. We learn that Petr began writing in his diary the day the Nazis decreed that all Jews in Czechoslovakia had to wear a yellow star on their clothes. The narration of Petr's Diary (in the voice of a young man) brings to life Petr's observations, of Nazi atrocities (Petr observes Jewish people humiliated and beaten in the streets, and worse), and though these observations are frequently matter-of-fact, some also convey Petr's great sense of humor as he writes a poem poking fun at the ridiculousness of Nazi anti-Jewish decrees.

Petr's fascination with the works of Jules Verne is shown to have impacted his imagination and had a bearing on his artwork. Petr not only had artistic talent, he was also an author who could conjure imaginative stories inspired by Verne's amazing worlds.

Interestingly, many of Petr's art during his stay in the Terezin concentration camp were vivid, bright, and portrayed beauty. Perhaps these were symbols of Petr's hope that things would get better, a show of defiance, or perhaps it was just a way for a young boy to cope with what life had thrown at him? At times Petr's maturity astounds me, and there are certainly parallels between Petr and Anne Frank, both young Jewish people whose talents were scorched by the horrors of the Holocaust.

At the end of the documentary, viewers learn something that seems a fitting tribute to an extraordinary young man.

About First Run Features
The length of the film is 66 minutes, in color

I highly recommend this documentary for middle school and high school collections, as well as for public library collections. It is also recommended for anyone with a keen interest in Holocaust history. I would also recommend complementing this stellar documentary with reading Petr's actual diary which was published several years ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Diary-of-Petr-Ginz/dp/0802143601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Diary of Petr Ginz</a>, which is a compelling and heartbreaking read.",1365552000,4,3547,5.188811188811189
5528952,5,B00AZ43C1A,"An amazing story of a remarkable young man during the darkest of times.  If only we all could have his heart, courage, and strength to live like Petr did.  The film incorporates a great story using historical photos, animation, and real time with excellent music.  Two thumbs up!",1365120000,3,279,4.770833333333333
5528953,5,B00AZ43C1A,"Until I watched this 66-minute film (2012), I had no idea who Petr Ginz was, and until 2007 neither did most people; even though who studied the holocaust. But, when one of Ginz' drawings was chosen to go on the space shuttle Columbia, and it was mentioned in reports of Columbia's fatal crash, his name got out. His sister, Eva, two years his junior survived the holocaust and discovered his illustrated diaries and they were published in book form in 2008. Through masterful direction and the creative use of animation (to bring Ginz's story to life), Directors Sandy Dickson and Churchill Roberts have told the world about this ""genius"", who, at age 6 was making drawings, and by age 14 he had written five novels and, by 16 produced 170 drawings and painting and edited an underground newspaper in the concentration camp in Terezin. At age 16 he was transported to Auschwitz where he died in the gas chamber.
As the film progressed - using many archival family photos provided by Eva - and excerpts of recent interviews with her (she now lives in Israel) - I sat riveted to the screen. The scenes of life in the concentration camp were mixed with Petr's illustrations and words from one of his novels, an allegory about a prehistoric monster which told the story of Hitler's rise to power as well as another colorful, and optimistic, one about a space ship. Petr had devoured all Jules Verne's books and this was his tribute.

I don't want to tell you too much about Petr because the film will tell you that. Petr was like Anne Frank in being an eyewitness but, unlike Frank, he was more prolific (he even invented a code language to write part of his diary) and was an illustrator as well.

The film played a few film festivals but is now widely available. The DVD adds three ""bonus videos"" (made in 2013) of which two are very helpful in understanding the film. First is a 13-minute ""making of"" where Direct Dickson explains her choice to animate Petr's still paintings. The 10 minute short on the music of the film has composer John Califra explaining his choices of themes for the film.  The six-minute featurette on the animator Cory Godbey, spends more time on his other work than this film, but is still interesting to watch.
I can't speak too highly of this film and DVD and - after watching it - one can only fantasize what Petr's life and accomplishments would have been had he lived beyond age 16.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

These Cast-off seeds from his journey, through a desolate boneyard of tortured, burnt, and broken dreams among souls withered by defeat, are left to bloom and be cultured by those who refuse to succumb to defeat.  This young mans physical presence may have passed, but he has left the behind seeds to plant those left behind him in darkness so they can focus on, and amplify, even the tiniest light to keep their soul from being swept away to the blackness.

As a teacher, I am writing curriculum to integrate a thematic unit that will tie into our standards and introduce students to another great loss of the Holicaust, Petra Ginz.
