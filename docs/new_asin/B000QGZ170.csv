8196401,1,B000QGZ170,I loved Susan's first videos. This one is just her talking and trying to motivate. This has no actual work out to it and not worth paying money for. I didn't know it was just her talking or I would never have purchased it. If I want motivation I would like to get it from an actual work out video.,1324857600,4,297,3.966666666666667
