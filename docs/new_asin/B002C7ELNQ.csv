3904677,3,B002C7ELNQ,"Routine, rather unimaginative western directed by Robert Parrish is set in 1856 San Francisco. A miner (Joel McCrea, looking tired and showing his age) rides into town for some fun and gets involved with shady lady (Yvonne De Carlo) who's working with corrupt politician (Sidney Blackmer, ROSEMARY'S BABY). Unremarkable but with a few touches that temporarily lift it out of the ordinary like a showdown on a beach with the gunfighters on horseback and a waterfront atmosphere that rings authentic. Two performances stand out too. Blackmer makes a cold hearted villain with an acid wit and Florence Bates as a one eyed white slaver (she shanghais drunks and sells them) has the film's best line.

The DVD from the Timeless Media Group is an unexceptional transfer on the soft side with weak contrast. But certainly watchable.",1332374400,,825,5.0661764705882355
3904678,5,B002C7ELNQ,"this movie is a bit slow  and not a lot of action for this type of movie, not much to recommend on  but good for the price , it is still worth watching , more of a romance than a western
Sidney Blackmer  is very good in it , its in B/W and sound  bit low in parts,  It seems that DVDs  are dropping back with the sound compare to VHS tapes,",1284163200,,340,3.6527777777777777
3904679,5,B002C7ELNQ,I enjoyed the movie. Joel McCrea has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I am 82 years old and enjoy the old western movies he made.,1282694400,6,137,3.7586206896551726
3904680,3,B002C7ELNQ,"Before ""Cry Danger"" director Robert Parrish made his urban western outing ""The San Francisco Story"" with Joel McCrea and Yvonne DeCarlo, he won an Academy Award for Best Editing on the 1947 boxing movie ""Body and Soul.""  During his twenty year career as a director, Parrish made variety of movies, among them gangster movies, World War II military movies, and westerns. ""The San Francisco Story"" evokes memories of the 1935 Howard Hawks' epic ""Barbary Coast,"" but Parrish achieved more success with his tale about crime and corruption in the colorful city by the bay before California became a state. Clocking everything in at a short and snappy 80-minutes, Parrish and ""Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion"" scenarist D.D. Beauchamp, along with an uncredited western writer William Bowers, adapted the Richard Summers story """"Vigilante"" and delivered an above-average, often entertaining, but clearly predictable little western about empire building.  Veteran western star Joel McCrea gets himself (as well as his stunt man) tangled up in several knuckle-bruising fistfights in this black & white Warner Brothers release when he isn't trying to kiss and cuddle with his attractive co-star.  Yvonne DeCarlo and McCrea later encored as a couple in ""Border River"" in 1954.

The chief asset of ""The San Francisco Story"" is the villain that actor Sidney Blackmer, who made a career out of impersonating Theodore Roosevelt, plays with such oily charm.  As Andrew Cain, Blackmer owns San Francisco and DeCarlo is his right-hand gal.  Her portrait hangs in the saloon behind the bar.  Initially, Adelaide McCall (DeCarlo) and Rick Nelson (McCrea) don't hit it off.  Cain sends her off with Nelson for an evening along so that she can pick his brain. It seems that the last time that San Francisco suffered from vigilantes; Nelson was one of the chief architects of the vigilante movement. All Nelson wants to do now is work his mining claim until he lays his eyes on Adelaide.  During their first night out in a buggy ride along the coast, Nelson riles Adelaide so she uses the horse whip on him and leaves him stranded. Later, she apologizes to Nelson in person, but he says something that she doesn't like and she has him shanghaied. Nelson awakens in the hole of a ship bound for Asia and fights his way out of it.

Interestingly, McCrea never whips out his six-shooter in this oater as he romances DeCarlo and scheme with Blackmer.  There's one very good twist about midway through the action when our hero tries to infiltrate the villains.  Tor Johnson, who made a name for himself in the films of Ed Wood, has a small role here as a saloon bouncer.",1269216000,10,2652,4.92152466367713
3904681,4,B002C7ELNQ,"While The San Francisco Story will never be considered a classic of the Western genre, it is a good movie.  Joel McCrae leads the cast in a story of political corruption in San Francisco circa 1856.  It is a well written movie, with some good dialogue and some decent (if somewhat low key) action scenes.

The DVD may not be great, but it isn't bad, either.  The picture is clear, even if not perfectly sharp at all times.  The sound is also fairly clear (the audio issues are very minor), so there isn't anything to keep a classic movie buff from enjoying this DVD.

Joel McCrea fans, especially, should check this one out.",1265500800,17,624,4.477876106194691

3904691,3,B002C7ELNQ,"The San Francisco Story, 1952 film

Two riders approach San Francisco in 1856. They see a hanged man with a sign of the Committee of Vigilance. Ringing bells tells of a jury verdict of murder. Will the condemned tell who hired him? No. The verdict is executed. There is a fight in a tavern, a man was cheated. There is a portrait of a woman in the saloon. Mr. Kaine is threatened by a cheated man. Is the legal system honest? What is Rick Nelson doing in town? Kaine makes promises, he has a following, and is very ambitious. Rick Nelson wins big at poker. Gambling leads to a fight. A woman wins with a four-flush, then talks with Nelson. Adelaide later sends a note with an apology to Nelson. Nelson runs into trouble by the docks, but gets away. Kaine meets with his conspirators to talk about buying votes to win an election. Kaine asks Winfield to sign a document so Kaine can control patronage.

Nelson talks about shanghaied sailors. Sadie gives him advice, Nelson is a miner now. Nelson meets Kaine (who doesnt trust him). Nelson wants a railroad track relocated closer to his mine; the price is to get one of Kaines henchmen out of jail (he bought votes). At night that prisoner is taken out but there is a change in plans! Shooting erupts. Nelson is wounded, he wants his death reported. Adelaide reacts to this news by sending a letter to the newspaper. Adelaide is arrested as an accomplice! Martin talks to Nelson about the situation. Shorty tells the news to Adelaide. There is a meeting that night, Kaine speaks of the future. Nelson challenges Kaine to a duel in the morning on the beach. Adelaide warns Nelson of a likely double-cross. A man with a rifle shoots at Nelson, but the duel goes on; Kaine loses. That rifleman is neutralized by Nelsons friend.

This is at best an average movie that uses the politics of San Francisco for its background. How reliable is its story of personal ambition and romantic rivalry? Hollywood produces entertainment, not history. To learn about San Francisco read Committee of Vigilance by George R. Stewart. Vigilante Committees cleaned up crime in 1851 San Francisco when a crooked sheriff wouldnt act. This was copied in the many small mining camps in the west. Vigilante is Spanish for watchman, the title of those who kept law and order in a town. San Francisco was the main port and financial center on the West Coast since 1849. It is on a peninsula and has limited room for expansion, unlike Los Angeles, Chicago or New York City. Growth occurs on the coast.",1469491200,,2519,4.618303571428571

3904738,5,B002C7ELNQ,"In all truth, I think at least, Joel McCrea and Evon DeCarlo are two very much under rated actors and the stuff they did tops much of what the produce today under the concept of ""entertainment."" Don't get me wrong, drug, sex and rock and roll still sells even though way too many movies have made about drug, sex and rock and roll. In fact, I have often believed that many movies today are paid for by drugs to launder money, but this review should not be about drug, sex or rock and roll, but about the movie?

To me this was a great movie of many, far under rated than they should be. Well done, well written and even well acted, with a flair for the barberry-coast, which to me makes the movie even better. I would recommend this movie to anyone as it is written for anyone to view. I really would encourage Amazon to offer far more movies than they do that are from the era, which are even far better than what is offered today.",1404518400,,932,4.206703910614525
