A child had a crush on a popular teacher who was overly kind to all her students.  Unfortunately, this child had serious psychiatric issues and ultimately killed himself.  He had been in out out of facilities and Mrs. Hogan had nothing to do with his death.  Even though these boys thought they were solving a murder, they were not.  The murder was in their heads and it all came out at trial.  The vulgar language and anger in the previous review is biased and not accurate as it states what his ""friends"" told him.  Hey, whatever sells a book, right?",1415059200,,726,4.6015625
8121166,1,B000FDFXGI,"This film is a piece of fiction based on the botched prosecution of the very real Lou Ann Hogan; a teacher who had sexual relations with multiple student in 1987.  On March 10, 1988, high school teacher Lou Ann Hogan was fired after having been accused of having sex with her 17 year old student Chad Cadenhead, who ended up committing suicide. The 24 year old Hogan denied the accusations. Mrs. Hogan was known as a good teacher who got a long very well with her students. Some school officials felt that she was a little too comfortable and open with her students. Trouble started for the pretty English and Spanish teacher after 4 students reported to school authorities that they had witnessed sex between Hogan and their friend Chad. Here is how the event unfolded.

Chad had been telling people that he was sleeping with teacher Lou Ann Hogan. The students did not believe him, so on one occasion; he invited them to his home so that they could see for themselves. According to court testimony Taylor Sommer and Scott Autry were spending the night at Chad's home when the teacher called and said that she was on her way over. The boys sneaked out of the house and watched Chad and Mrs. Hogan having sex from Chad's bedroom window. The boys had very little to do with Chad after the event. On January 28, 1988, the 17 year old emotionally disturbed Cadenhead went to his bedroom, put a shotgun in his mouth, and shot himself to death several days after his birthday. Shortly afterward, Taylor Sommer's sister advised him to tell their parents about what he witnessed between Chad and Mrs. Hogan. The Sommers then contacted the Cadenheads, who told school authorities, and Mrs. Hogan was suspended in February of 1988 and then fired the following month. Hogan decided to sue both school officials and the 4 boys. Taylor Sommer, Scott Autry, Jeff Beckel, and Hector Torres, were named in the $400,000 suit.

The Trial

Lou Ann Hogan was indicted for having sex with a minor. She turned herself into the Bexar County Jail accompanied by her Husband and mother in law. She was booked and released on $10,000 bond. Trial began September 28, 1988, and the District Attorney set out to prove that Hogan had ""initiated and went into a sexual relationship with a minor."" Lou Ann pleaded innocent. The defense tried to show that trouble started after Chad's suicide because everyone was looking for ""someone to blame."" Everyone was trying to think of one reason why he would want to kill himself, and so the boys decided to tell what Chad had told them. This case was huge. The courtroom was packed. Spectators had to be turned away. Mrs. Cadenhead testified that she had no idea who Lou Ann was when she saw her at the wake. She said that at first she thought she was one of the students, and asked her if she had any classes with Chad. That is when Lou Ann indicated that she was actually a teacher. Greg Trcka testified that he had witnessed Mrs. Hogan go into Chad's room while everyone was at the house to console the family. A Clark High Spanish teacher, Martha Garcia, testified that she too saw Hogan go into Chad's bedroom, and that she had also witnessed her crying in the teacher's lounge after Chad's death. Another teacher testified that she saw Lou Ann hug and kiss a student under the bleachers at one of the football games. She confronted Lou Ann about it, and said that Lou Ann said ""oh, we're just good friends, and that they go out together sometimes."" Hector Torres testified how he remembered seeing Hogan's car parked outside Chad's home. Mrs. Hogan stated that the sexual accusations were totally false, and her husband testified that Lou Ann was home on the nights in question. Hogan testified that she remembered meeting Chad one day during her first semester in the 1986-1987 school year when he passed by her classroom with one of her students. Afterward, Cadenhead would frequently stop by and talk to her. The visits continued until Chad was checked into the Afton Oaks Psychiatric Hospital. When he was released he made contact with her again stating that he wanted to talk to her about family problems. The jury deliberated and returned with a verdict of innocent in October 1989. Mr. Mike Hogan was in tears, and the Cadenheads were silent after the verdict was read. The Cadenheads filed a civil suit against Hogan and the school, but later dropped it. Lou Ann and her husband live in Schenectady, New York. School Superintendent Jack C.Jordan still firmly believes the story of the 4 boys even though the jury did not. The Cadenheads dropped the suit on February 11, 1990.

I was there for this.  I wasn't in Lou Ann's classes but plenty of my friends were and I saw her on a regular basis.  Chad, Scott, Taylor and Jeff were all friends I grew up with and played football with for years.  My two vivid personal recollections of Lou Anne were 1. seeing her coming down the stair well one day in a super short skirt with a sheer top that let her titties jingle-jangle about; which was pretty hot, but horribly unprofessional, and 2. seeing her making out for half the game with one of my 16 year old classmates (who will remain nameless) in the Clark - Churchill varsity game at Alamo stadium in late 1987.  Not under the bleachers mind you, but in the stands where planty of people saw.  One of my teachers (who will also remain nameless) also saw Lou Ann at the stadium with the nameless student and reported the incident to the Clark administration.  Those administrators (principal and vice-principal) chose to ignore this and other allegations as to what Lou Ann was up to.  They weren't bad people at all but in 1987 this was almost unheard of behavior from a teacher.  I knew about Chad boning her long before any of this became news, and of course we 16 year old boys thought it was pretty cool.  In fact one of the other guys (also nameless) was bringing a video camera to one of Chad's bone-sessions but then had to bow out for a hunting trip; too bad!  He invited the guys to watch through his bedroom window while she blew him, and of course he insisted on keeping the blinds open and the lights on.  Once Chad killed himslef and Lou Ann was implicated, she ditched the short mini-skirts and tittie-tops for nun-like outfits with big, conspicuous crosses.  The media and the know-nothing fools ate it up in the ensuing media circus.  Lou Anne had sexual relations with no less than three of my classmates, and probably more (Chad, Nameless, and Randy Browder).  Randy unfortunately, killed himself too almost a year after Chad.  I was told at the time he had left a suicide note referencing his relationship with Lou Anne.  Long story short, Lou Anne Hogan was and is a scum-bag.  Her husband was either blinded by his faith in her or a retard, or both.  As a 16 year old, it sounded cool for a bunch of my 16 year old high school guy friends to bone their hot teacher, but as an adult years later, I know there's a reason why it's illegal for adults to consort with minors.  It's too much for them to handle and bad things happen.  Chad was a great kid even though he had problems and I have often thought of what he would have done with himself if he could have gotten beyond this crisis.  For those of us who knew him, his suicide was a hammer blow.  Knowing that Lou Ann was a big part of his problems, and watching her manipulate the gullible fools, was the added insult to the injury.",1297728000,3,7430,4.562734785875282
