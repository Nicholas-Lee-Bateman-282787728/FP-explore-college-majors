8177460,5,B00066FMK6,"Paradise is an excellent episode with outstanding scenes with Gil, Rowdy, and everyone else.  It would have been great if Columbia House would have continued making the entire series on VHS, but as is often the case, they decided to jump around and only make 50 episodes of the 217 made. Stubborn Philadelphia(?)man won't sell his home and land in the town of Paradise! Gil's scenes are amazing in this episode. You just don't see stuff like that anymore.

Confidence Creek is also an excellent episode. Great stuff with Gil and Rowdy!",1122422400,2,535,4.804347826086956
