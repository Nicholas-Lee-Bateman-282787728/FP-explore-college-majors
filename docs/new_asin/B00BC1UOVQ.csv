5572294,4,B00BC1UOVQ,"The first time I saw Sloppy The Psychotic, it was just a couple of weeks after all of those children were gunned down at that elementary school by Adam Lanza. There is a scene in Sloppy The Psychotic where a bunch of kids are violently killed, so that scene alone ruined this movie for me and I was deeply offended and disturbed. However, I just watched this movie again for the second time, and I knew what to expect. And it was much better. This is a good movie that managed to fun and shocking at the same time. It's only 75 minutes, so there is very little time for character development and there is pretty much no filler. It's a tight little film.",1361145600,,653,4.274193548387097

Anyone willing to give Sloppy the Psychotic more than a cursory glance will soon find themselves held within its feverish grip. First things first: this is not a bad movie, so don't book Sloppy if that's what you're looking for. Reaction at 10 minutes in was chiefly surprise. I was in good hands with these filmmakers, and honestly hadn't expected to be. The acting is solid for such a low budget endeavor, particularly from Mike O'Malley as the eponymously named clown. I mean, if I had some money to put behind these guys, I'd pay then ten times the original budget to go make pretty much the exact same movie again. Why? Because Sloppy delivers the goods. Sloppy, the ill fated children's entertainer, is one hell of a great killer: he's treated with such casually dished out cruelty at times, some viewers might think his motives are entirely justified. This is indie horror at its absolute pinnacle: offensive, mean spirit, featuring a brilliantly conceived killer to cheer for, and some pretty decent metal on the soundtrack.",1441756800,,1129,5.0
8565657,1,B00BC1UOVQ,"Where do we begin? First off, did this just come out? Because it looks like it was filmed on my parents' JVC home video recorder from 1987? Anyway...

Hardly respectable even on an indie level. Clearly, Mike O'Mahony got his on-parole friends, their girlfriends together (including their children) to get pretend-murdered. Wonderful. And this review is coming from a horror fan.

This is complete garbage. No plot, no editing, no acting, no dignity...

On the other hand, it's quite the unintentional comedy.

Tips for the filmmaker:
- Invest in microphones. It helps to hear dialogue.
- Maybe use multiple camera angles.
- Lighting is helpful.

8565659,2,B00BC1UOVQ,"Mike (Mike O'Mahony) is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet who hears voices inside his head. Eventually he get triggered into a beserker mode. The DVD box claims it includes ""rape, murder, cannibalism, mass slaughter, alcoholism and balloon animals."" Unfortunately none of it was done too well, with effects being worse than Troma, almost on the order of ""Birdemic.""

While the movie hails great cheesy effects, the downfall is the lack of decent dialouge. The killing was rather disjointed withe Sloppy killing for a revenge factor, but then at random too. They should have spent more time building up the revenge factor and drop the random stupidity.

8565660,4,B00BC1UOVQ,"There have been movies that claim to be over the top or hard core. And then we bump into Sloppy. Yes, the best use of an outdoor grill and a snow blower at a kids party. ever. Most of you won't watch this, but you will hear mythic stories about just how extreme and out of control this thing gets. As such, I would say if you stomach things like Human Centipede or Zombi 2...then what are you waiting for. Bad taste as an art-form is right here. Good job Mike O'Mahony. Ted Mikels should be proud.",1371254400,,497,4.134020618556701
8565661,5,B00BC1UOVQ,"Sloppy is psychotic.  It's fun (ok, I may be a bit of a sicko) to watch him tumble into complete madness, I mean this guy really looses it and what happens is completely sick, twisted, and entertaining.  Clown movies never fail to please with me.  This one's a keeper.",1368316800,,268,4.428571428571429
