I was told it wasn't on DVD,that I had to order the Movie only thru Itunes. Just as I was getting ready to order the Movie I saw this Double Movie with YOUNGBLOOD!

If your an ""Orginal Gangstas"" fan, Fred Williamson is trying to get a sequel funded through Kickstarter at the moment. Check out OriginalGangstas2.com for details and a special message from Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson himself.",1389484800,2,364,4.887096774193548
