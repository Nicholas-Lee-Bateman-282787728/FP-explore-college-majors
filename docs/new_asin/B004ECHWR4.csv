8426701,5,B004ECHWR4,"First, I am a sucker for movies about people in show business. On the other hand, the era of Franco's Spain confuses me! This 2011 DVD from Spain is a mashup of the two. Don't be alarmed though, the central story of ""Pjaros de papel"" is never confusing and always involving.

In addition, it boasts a sterling cast:

  * Imanol Arias (""The Flower of my Secret"") is wonderful as a grieving father, a vaudevillian and a revolutionary. I was struck by his resemblance to Oregon Shakespeare Festival's Michael Elich: he sings, dances and does comedy shtick. His character is heroic and tender, smart and resourceful.
  * Llus Homar (""Broken Embraces"") is terrific as his gay fellow vaudevillian, wary and afraid, but brave when the chips are down.
  * Roger Prncep (""Mil cretins"") is winning as the desperate little boy who latches onto them and won't let go.

I could name other cast members but unless you are an avid aficionado of foreign films, it would waste our time. As you could tell by my opening line, I really liked this one.

As soon as I obtained my All-Region DVD player from Amazon.com (see earlier review), I went right back and ordered this DVD, also from Amazon. I LOVE having these options!",1324684800,,1205,4.668246445497631
8426702,3,B004ECHWR4,"A Spanish movie ""Pajaros De Papel"" (""Paper Birds"") is about a small theater troupe in the time of Franco's regime. The film benefits from interesting characters and the believable surrogate father-son relationship bolstered by strong acting from the cast, but with a melodramatic storyline and underwritten subplots, it fails to deliver an emotional punch.

Set in the post Civil War (1936-39) Madrid, ""Pajaros De Papel"" begins with a comic actor Jorge del Pino (Imanol Arias), who had lost his son and wife during the war. One year after the tragic event, Jorge comes back to the stage. He takes a streetwise orphaned boy Miguel (Roger Prncep, an adapted child in ""The Orphanage"") under his wing, teaching him things about the stage and life, too.

Jorge and Miguel form a mentor-pupil relationship, which gets stronger as they perform comic antics on stage with Jorge's partner Enrique (Llus Homar). Meanwhile, a military officer suspecting connection between theater members and anti-Franco activists sends a spy among them.

One good thing about ""Pajaros De Papel"" is that despite the subject matter the film is not depressing. Sweet (maybe too sweet) moments are interspersed with funny songs and stage performances. Its attempt at a tearjerker looks manipulative, to be sure, but the result is not mawkish, if very sentimental.

Unfortunately, director Emilio Aragn (his feature debut) crammed too many things into one movie. None of the film's too many subplots - Miguel's parentage, Enrique's sexuality, seduction of a young dancer Merceditas (Ana Cuesta) and so on - is fully developed. Filmmakers even attempt to include a suspense element which I think is out of place here.

With the superb acting from the main cast, professionally shot cinematography and memorable songs, ""Pajaros De Papel"" is a flawed, but fairly engrossing drama.",1316476800,,1846,5.244067796610169
8426703,5,B004ECHWR4,"I saw this film at a festival and was left breathless. I cannot wait for it to come out in the USA. It has such a great story and such heart rending passions. The photography, the soundtrack the writing, this film has it all. This is one I will buy many times to give as a present.
Very important personal stories told durning the Franco period in Spain. If you like history and personal story well told this is for you. It will leave you breathless, like it did the crowd at the festival.
I am so surprised we have not heard more about its release here. It is one of my favorites, with out a doubt.",1304121600,,599,4.128205128205129
