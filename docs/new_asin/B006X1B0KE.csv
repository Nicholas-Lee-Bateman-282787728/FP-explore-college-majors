5028323,5,B006X1B0KE,"A very well crafted story/documentary told by one of the few people who had any insight into the life of this spymaster... his son. I doubt very many people had any idea who William Colby was, what a mysterious life he led before he became Director of the CIA. I was fascinated by the story of his life.",1357430400,,303,4.241379310344827

5028325,4,B006X1B0KE,"A career retrospective of former CIA director William Colby, who stepped in to bite the bullet when congress smelled blood following Watergate and the Vietnam War. Left with nothing more than photos and questions in the wake of his father's mysterious disappearance on an early-morning canoe ride, Colby's filmmaker son doesn't seem to have any alternative but to seek his answers in the past. The result is a startlingly open, sweeping glimpse at the CIA's involvement in Cold War politics and the Kennedy / Nixon regimes. At times it's very dry, but the narrative is constantly loaded with historical nuggets from the men who lived it - like the kind of programming we could expect from the History Channel before it turned into whatever it is now. It's strange that, as the scale increases, Colby almost becomes an afterthought in his own story, but the film certainly tells a better story because of it. Bittersweet, insightful and informative, if too reliant on talking heads and Ken Burns photo zooms.",1347235200,4,1007,4.964497041420119
5028326,4,B006X1B0KE,"Keep in mind that this is a documentary, rather than a dramatic re-enactment.  As such, it consists of interviews and old film tracks interspersed with still shots and a voice over. It will appeal to historians and those with an interest in mid-twentieth century American foreign policy. My only regret was that not much was presented about Colby's personal life in his later years--including the aftermath of his shocking divorce.  Of course, the man was a consummate spy, so the sparseness of information about this phase of his life is perhaps not surprising.",1342396800,,562,5.032258064516129
5028327,5,B006X1B0KE,"Since it has been and remains so popular to paint the CIA as some renagade agency bent on taking over the country and guilty of assassinating anyone who disagrees with them, it is wonderful to find a film that provides real history and insight into the CIA and one of it's great leaders. I have been a fan of William Colby since the 70's when he demonstrated honesty along with courtesy and professionalism par excellence in his testamony before the Church Committee hearings. During those hearings when many were simply on a witch hunt and looking to make a vain glorious name for themselves, Mr Colby's testamony was nothing short of superb. His autobiography reveals a man who was dedicated to his country and to freedom and democracy. This film is a grand history lesson and, contrary to another reviewer, provides insight into Colby as a man and not just as a spy. Carl Colby has honoured his father and his father's work with this film. I look forward to the book.",1340409600,6,970,4.645348837209302
5028328,5,B006X1B0KE,"I saw 'The Man Nobody Knew' as part of the Spokane International Film Festival.  One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.  Life in post WWII Italy, the interviews, the feeling of dispair as the US slide's into the Vietman War...  I can't really add much to the previous reviews except I couldn't believe there was no Academy Award nomination.  Is it really possible that this film was not submitted?",1339977600,,404,4.728571428571429
5028329,5,B006X1B0KE,"I got to know Bill Colby after he retired from the Agency. From my perspective, he was one of the greatest Americans of the past century. His career, always in the support and advancement of his country, was spent largely in environments of great physical danger, and in times of tremendous stress. Yet I never knew him to back down, complain, or waiver from what he believed was the right thing to do. The Phoenix Program was the great negative in his career, not for what it was, but for what it was reported to be. I was disappointed in Carl Colby's depiction of the Phoenix program which seemed to support Bill's critics and, unremarkably, the critics of the Vietnam War. Bill Colby explained the program in detail in his writings--and I believe his account to be accurate. It was not put together as an assassination program. Yet, and this is why I question the film's motives to some degree, the infamous assassination of the Viet Cong soldier by Colonel Loan on a street in Saigon during Tet '68 was shown as the voice over talks about the Phoenix Program as an assassination program. The execution of the Viet Cong (who had just prior to his capture executed a South Vietnamese soldier's family in cold blood) was in no way associated with the Phoenix Program and in fact was a legitmate execution of a captured enemy dressed in civilian clothing under martial law. Inserted where it was in the film,it gave a tremendous visual (and completely false)boost to the claims that the Phoenix Program was a ruthless and brutal assassination program. [As a footnote: after the war the North Vietnamese admitted that the Phoenix Program-put together to destroy the Viet Cong infrastructure and provide critical intelligence to the South--was one of the most successful efforts launched against them]
Carl Colby has created an interesting and largely respectful document about his father. And it would be a serious ommission to exclude the footage of the hypocritical Congressmen, led by Church and Pike, grilling the CIA Director. But for those of us who had some connection with the agency, and who knew Bill Colby, it was painful and frustrating to watch the congressional antics again. Yet, under any circumstances, it was good to see the great warrior again, even if by film. RIP William E. Colby

REVISIT:
FOR some reason I rarely watch the special features on DVDs. Because of my respect for Bill Colby and his family, I decided to watch the James Reston interview of the filmaker, Carl Colby. It was moving and informative. His understanding of his father was much deeper than I thought after only watching the feature. Carl's honesty and intelligent insights into his father's personal life and career are better than the feature itself in many ways. A story about Bill Colby being driven home and wanting to stop for a drink prompted me to realize that my association with him would be of a nature that his family could probably never have--I was one of the team, the guys, the guys who ""understood."" And in my own insignificant service there were times where the 'mission' seemed the only reality. Bill's family felt this and probably hated it.
Carl, if you read this, there were assassinations in the Phoenix program, even though your dad specifically prohibited them. And you were absolutely right, the pacification teams took back control of large areas of South Vietnam through the Phoenix program.
William E. Colby was the right man for the job throughout the Vietnamese War. He was a critical part of the effort which won the American phase of the war in 1973. I don't think he had self-doubts or regrets. He had little if anything to feel guilty about. I don't believe he committed suicide. When I knew him, he was full of life and we celebrated the end of the Evil Empire in one of the only emotional chats I ever had with him. I was to meet him the night before he disappeared but my airplane was late and I missed him. I  regret that I did not have that last dinner with him in the small French restuarant in Georgetown. He was a great man. I miss him my dinners with him. Thanks for making the film.",1334966400,31,4120,4.704986149584488

5028353,4,B006X1B0KE,"This a very well-made film. Technically speaking, I thought it might deserve 5 stars. But I could not rightfully say about it that ""I loved it!"" as the category of ""5 stars"" is defined. First of all, I could personally relate very well to William Colby. - even to the end where he exited into the wilderness. After I was drafted in 1958, the Army assigned me to their Counter Intelligence Corps (C.I.C.) - the Army equivalent of the C.I.A. In '62, I was honorably discharged. I was an atheist, but I had been disgusted by the C.I.C. which appeared to me to be basically amoral - even though as an atheist I did not acknowledge the existence of ""good & evil."" Like many others, the war in Vietnam was of great concern to me & I did quite a bit of research on it. I found that the Vietnamese hated being a French colony - & being oppressed by the Japanese during WW2. When, after the war the French tried to re=assert their dominion, the Vietnamese appealed to the U.S. for support, but we were allies with the French. So Vietnam had no one to turn to but the communists. Then of course there was the shame of Watergate. Because of my involvement in the C.I.C., I understood very well what Colby went though in the Senate hearings concerning the C.I.A. And I also experienced a severe ""downtime"" that resulted in my heading for the California Sierra wilderness. However, God rescued me. A film could have made of each of the several topics addressed in this film - but this one film did a very commendable job nevertheless. One final comment: I'm not at all surprised at the unfortunate ending. A career job in the intelligence community could have that result. Kudos to Carl Colby!",1397779200,,1680,4.493464052287582
5028354,4,B006X1B0KE,"Foul play? Suicide? Natural causes?

When former CIA Director William Colby died on April 27, 1996, after embarking on a solitary canoe ride near his home of Rock Point, Maryland, speculation immediately arose as to the cause of his demise. Even though the coroner cited natural causes (a heart attack or stroke causing him to fall into the water), the veneer of mystery that enshrouded Colbys life made speculation inevitable.

Who better, then, to try to shed light on the secretive life of the Man Nobody Knew than his own son, Carl Colby?

Truth be told, the film wouldnt be nearly as effective were it made by filmmakers without a family connection to Colby. Unless one is drawn to themes involving spying and politics, the film might otherwise have limited appeal. But when the subjects interviewed say things like your father when talking about Colby senior, which makes it plain they are addressing son Carl, the filmmaker, this serves to create an intimacy, even an urgency as we become drawn into the fascinating story about a man it seems very few people really knew. It is also somewhat endearing. After all, if your dad was a controversial public figure, wouldnt you want to get the facts straight?

I want to better know my father is clearly the impetus behind this film. Whether its to vindicate him for some of his professional choices or to simply find out who he was, there is a simple, straightforward honesty about Carl Colbys motivation which translates into his film making and which is always involving and, at times, quite moving.

Personal politics will temper audience reaction to William Colbys life and career. One thing is obvious; here was a man who loved the challenges inherent in his job, a man who was not afraid to get his hands dirty. By the Vietnam era, particularly during implementation of directives such as Operation Phoenix, Colbys hands became very dirty indeed. Such ill-fated landmarks of the 20th-Century as the war in Vietnam continue to provoke strong emotions and most people today would agree the conflict should never have happened, but anyone who was there and trying to make sense out of it had to make difficult decisions. There were reasons for the war and at the time they were compelling.

The political situation in Vietnam was not unlike events in Korea a decade earlier, with the country split between the Communist north and the Republican south. The Korean war arguably prevented World War III. Might the situation in Vietnam, left unchecked, have eventually led to the same outcome? Well never know and the point is moot, but in Colbys case, it is clear he acted out of a strong sense of selective morality and truly believed in both the actions he was taking and the means by which he attempted to accomplish his goals.

Apparently a devout Catholic, Colby senior must be judged, if he is judged at all, by the values his faith system represents, without the cynicism that often accompanies a persons profession of spiritual influence. But in light of the atrocities that peppered Operation Phoenix, which involved the wholesale torture and killing of suspected Viet Cong, often by the most gruesome means imaginable, this is thorny territory indeed. After all, just how much terror is justified for the greater good? Complex, difficult and as extreme as these questions may be, Colby the filmmaker does not shy away from showing them, or his fathers role in instigating them.

Politics and morality aside  and the film gives us enough information to understand the various political climates that contextualize Colbys work and decision-making  the reason THE MAN NOBODY KNEW is so effective is that it is ultimately about what the secondary title of the film says it is: In search of my father CIA Spymaster William Colby. By making a film about his dad and his desire to want to know him better, Carl Colby masterfully presents polarizing subject matter in such a way that the viewer is compelled to accompany him on his journey. And that is superior storytelling by any definition.

On a side note, viewers should know that there is some very graphic footage from the Vietnam sequences, some of it very hard to watch. And, there is some very interesting bonus material, including additional interviews and Carl Colby himself being interviewed. First Run Features have once again picked a real winner.",1397433600,3,4367,4.903794037940379
5028355,5,B006X1B0KE,"The film mainly focuses on Colby starting at his marriage and through his CIA leadership. He actually lead an interesting life after ""he took himself off of the pedestal.""

Compared to the N.S.A. wholesale wiretapping of today, Wm. Colby was embarrassed when he leaned (as new CIA Director) that the CIA may have tapped as many as 100 phones. He knew the threat of communism but took his oath to the Constitution seriously. When he suggested several ideas to slow to fall of Saigon so that Americans and South Vietnamese friendlies can be evacuated, Henry Kissinger vetoes it, apparently preferring a bloodbath to show what communist do.

Told by his film maker son, Carl, Colby was a man I have grown to respect over the years. Dedicated, loyal, honest but with that generational ""hands off"" that my own father had and so many WWII veterans had.

The film is packed with historical figures and film clips I have never seen.  It and gives you a real glimpse into the life of a man who we should be given more respect for his sacrifices for this nation.",1392336000,3,1052,4.639784946236559
5028356,5,B006X1B0KE,Very interesting.  Great introduction to the Woods biography I am reading now.  I particularly like the Jedburgh thread running throughout Woods text and this documentary.

5028357,5,B006X1B0KE,"Bill Colby was perhaps the last of the soldier monks the Western World will ever see. A man from a different age, one in which service to the Republic overroad all else, no matter how dirty the game. He paid a heavy price for that devotion, and not just in terms of the grandstanding at his expense by the them luminaries of the U.S. Congress, shocked, shocked, that the spy business and special ops might involve killing. How times have changed now that we can eliminate enemies of the Republic with a drone strike. ""The Man Nobody Knew"" is one of the most thought provoking books of recent publication in terms of how one actually goes about protecting or furthering the national interest, and the potential price to be paid by those who take up the calling.",1372032000,2,760,4.554744525547445

5028359,5,B006X1B0KE,"The Blueray video quality is great, with the expected bump up.  Delivered in a prompt fashion.
I liked this because of the many links I felt it had to my own life experience growing up.  I could see a Prince Valiant experience was similar as my own as it was a comic strip that my father would read to us in the early 50's.  So was the belt, the use of ""friend"" and other terms.  Long ago I had read W. E. Colby's book  ""Honorable Men"" and first became more aware of him as an individual then.  In this video there are so many vivid revelations of insider information of significant historical events through out it.  But, the humanizing of Colby was the best part.  And yet will anyone ever know who he was?  As he is representitive of the US during this time, will we ever know who we were.  You'll have a better idea after viewing this.
 I would recommend this to anyone interested in history of the 1941 to 1975 period and beyond and then you will also see some of the players that have figured prominently in the last 20 years.",1361318400,2,1032,4.241025641025641
8506074,1,B006X1B0KE,"A film about a man whos private life was utterly boring and who professionally did dirty work for uncle sam, except you don't get any dirty details. What you do get is an apologetic whitewashing of a general description of events and sympathetic interviews, ranging from omission to distortion or outright lies, hey but its OK cause the lies are private opinions of the guests. They make it seem as though the worst the man ever did was to tell a fib or two but it was entirely justified, because he did it for the good guys and he got an absolution from the pope anyway. It is perhaps too much to expect an honest account from the son of a machiavellian villain.

Other than being pointless and low on information, it was rather hard to watch, but when in the commentary he said that ""they competed for the moral high-ground"" I burst out laughing and nearly fell of my chair. Silver lining.",1513209600,,891,4.466257668711656

8506081,2,B006X1B0KE,"With what we now know about the post-WWII Operation Paperclip with Colby's predecessor, Alan Dulles, in charge and with Avery Dulles, a convert to Roman Catholicism and the first Cardinal ever to have bypassed the office of Bishop and given the Roman Catholic Church's proven connections to Operation Paperclip and the exodus of former Nazis, many requiring the tenacious tracking of Simon Wisenthal, the Nazi Hunter, to bring them to justice, I wish Carl Colby had spent more time on what his father surely knew about the ins and outs of Paperclip.  Especially since he was in post-war Italy through which the Italian Catholic hierarchy provided safe passage for war criminals.  Operation Phoenix builds on Operation Paperclip in as much as our very presence in Vietnam, as with so many other places, fits what the CIA's John Stockwell tells us is the CIA's major mission: identify enemies.  The American military establishment requires enemies and lots of them, but it also requires consent for war and that sometimes requires the manufacturer of enemies where none exist.  Being a critic of this runaway downward spiral is never unpatriotic as General Dwight David Eisenhower and General Smedley Darlington Butler told us.  General David Petraeus may have told us, too, had he survived the arrival of Paula Broadwell and her co-author, Vernon Loeb, whose writings for the Washington Post provided the absolutely false testimony to Pat Tillman's death and Jessica Lynch's rescue.  Perhaps he still will if he can avoid.......let's not go there.

  When we consider that Roman Catholic Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Britain, was Bostonian, Joseph P. Kennedy, who in the 1930's backed Hitler and was, therefore, recalled by FDR, combined with the 1930's fascist American business plot about which we heard zero in our high school civics classes or even college level history lectures with the plotters being leading U.S. industrialists with a penchant for German engineering of all kinds, why not use The Man Nobody Knew to really tell us that side of our unknown history?

  Throw in the story from Colby's aide, John DeCamp, and enlighten us as to the possible list of who might have wanted William Colby dead.  Conspiracy theories aside, didn't William Colby's testimony before the Church Committee inform of us of our actions much coarser than water boarding such as conspiracies to commit murder?  They called it revealing the ""family jewels"", but weren't the critics of Colby and Church showing us what a diamond in a pig's snout really looks like and weren't Colby, Church, Butler, Westhusing, Tillman and a host of others right to show us?  Political murders, but murder none the less?  Colby's mishap in 1996 was certainly convenient.  Going into a post-Clinton world when in 1999 Glass-Steagal was repealed and the 2000 election (*) of ""The Decider"" who found the door wide open in 2000 to bamboozle the American people in a myriad of ways, wouldn't a Bill Colby have been a serious threat, particularly if he was a principled American as this film shows and as he clearly was?

I could only imagine a Roman Catholic scholar like Col. Theodore ""Ted"" Westhusing returning from the Green Zone to compare notes with William Colby over a cup of coffee on K Street and not feeling that he faced the bamboozle and corruption all alone.  I believe that the world would be a safer place if William Colby had lived longer, but only if we listen to the message of the messenger/s and act accordingly.",1435449600,2,3508,4.976027397260274

8506083,5,B006X1B0KE,"This documentary is a MUST WATCH for those who appreciate the subtlety and nuance of history.
The documentary, of course, is about former CIA director William Colby. Colby was responsible for Southeast Asia during the civil war, and then went on to lead the CIA post Watergate. Worth noting, the movie the Good Shepard starring Matt Damon seems to be loosely based on Colby himself.
The film provides an in depth analysis on the professional career of William Colby. The bulk of which was during America's involvement in Vietnam 1959-74. Many will find this dry, I however did not.
 The narrative is provided through extensive interviews that include government, military, news and political officials. All of whom lived and participated in this time period in whatever faculty their profession offered.
In addition to this, another perspective is provided, that of his wife and his son ( also the director of the film). This is important because it adds such a depth to the narrative, trying to explain or understand the subject (Colby) and his motives.
Ultimately striking the heart of the documentary which is morality and its context to a man and his service to his country. A very complex man, with complex motives  with the intestinal fortitude to do what is ""right"" and necessary. A moral compass directed by his Catholicism.
The documentary is obviously biased, due to the director being the son of the subject of the documentary. However, if you're familiar with the time period you will find that the analysis and its conclusions are fair.
Worth noting is the infusion of politics throughout the film. I think that whichever way you lean on the political spectrum may taint your view of the film as a whole. Those who can be objective will note that whatever ones politics may be, the man's actions were pure of heart and done in his view of what was in the best interest of the country (us) and his agency.
That being said, I loved this documentary. It didn't just skim the surface, in dug deeper. Analysing the time period, and then putting it into the perspective of William Colby himself. Trying to understand the what and why of his actions. 5/5 stars.",1423094400,2,2167,4.82258064516129
