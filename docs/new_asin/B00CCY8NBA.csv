8580353,4,B00CCY8NBA,"It is a stylish gangster movie full of surprises. Irfan Khan lends certain gravitas to this movie. It as good or a little better than the first one-Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster. The nexus between politicians and gangsters that has become the staple of Indian movies is the basis of the story. The added glitz of inherited money and property of smaller Rajas is interesting. Utter Pradesh seems to be the setting though it is never clarified. With so many of former Rajas now in Indian politics, it is as realistic to find the fictional characters in the movie. Jimmy Shergil lends certain credence to being a big landlord and a criminal at the same time. The corruption and decadence reflected in Mahe Gills's character is a little less prominent in the sequel. In this movie it is all politics and less sex. The violence and gore seem to be better planned and used than in the first movie.",1386288000,,885,4.6075949367088604
8580354,4,B00CCY8NBA,"Tigmanshu Dhulia delivers another great story to us about politics, love and betrayal and the diminishing world of Indian royalty.
The Shahib in this film is confined to a wheelchair who falls in love with the gangsters fiancee, the bibi is a drunk and an  MLA and the gangster is Irfan who wants revenge for an ancient deed and for betrayal. There are many plot holes but despite its many flaws, SBAG is an engaging watch because of intrigue in its storyline and its wonderfully written dialogues. four stars. 11/11/2013",1384128000,,521,4.788888888888889
