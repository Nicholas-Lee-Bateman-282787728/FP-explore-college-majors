171268,3,084252455X,"This is a great movie, which I first saw at the Museum of Modern Art on the evening they held in honor of Nino Manfredi. I wasn't aware of anything by director Ettore Scola out on DVD, so I was surprised when I saw this movie was available at Amazon. According to the reviews I read here, it was supposed to have a so so picture quality and was also made for the purposes of learning Italian, but no one mentioned that the disc automatically went to the chapter menu after every scene. It is definitely annoying for anyone with intentions of enjoying the movie rather than learning Italian. Even if you bought this DVD to learn Italian, at one point you would like to watch the movie as a whole, I think, and the people at Brigham Young University, who produced this DVD, should have taken that into consideration and given the viewer this option as well. (I played this DVD on two different players, and tried to change some player settings too, but couldn't find a way to watch the movie without jumping to the menu every few minutes. If I am wrong and there is a way to watch the movie without interruption, please let me and all others interested know).  I still don't regret that I have bought the DVD since there is no other way of owning this movie now, and it is worth putting into your collection even with the flaws of it. One thing I wish to say to whichever company owns the rights to this movie is to put this out as a regular DVD release. Looking at the director, the cast and the cameos by Fellini, De Sica, and Mastroianni, I know fans of foreign films will jump on it even if they haven't seen it and don't know what great a movie this is.  Speaking of Ettore Scola and releasing great movies on DVD, his movie 'A Special Day' with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni is one of the greatest movies of all time according to many interested in film. I don't think it has been out on video since early 80s, and it is very difficult to find it anywhere to watch. So Criterion, Image, Kino, Fox Lorber, New Yorker or anyone from any other video company, who is reading this; somebody please pick this masterpiece up and release it on DVD. I am 24 and I hope I can wait for some time, but I am sure there are also older people who are dying to get this, please let them get it before they do!",976233600,10,2305,4.260273972602739
171269,4,084252455X,"This is a great classic of Italian cinema, and anyone who enjoys a well made movie should see this film.  This DVD was particularly helpful because it includes essays on the actors and the director, along with many  different versions of subtitles that vary in length.  You can watch the  movie with comprehensive word by word subtitles, or with ones that just  summarize what's going on, and they're in Italian or English, which is  helpful for students of Italian.
Even with the extra content of the film  aside, it is a fantastic show that portrays the life of three friends and  the woman that they all fall in love with during Italy's post World War II  era.  It is a highly allegorical film, using the main characters as a topos  of the nation Italy itself.",950054400,2,763,4.5777777777777775

171271,2,084252455X,"The movie is a great classic, but the restoration of this DVD is terrible. It is very blurry and noisy, the colors are off, and the compression is slipshod. The English translation is top-notch though. A film such as this should be done justice when released. The video transfer of the Eagle Pictures DVD (""Capolavori - Edizione Restaurata"") is better by far. If you want this dvd for Italian language-learning purposes, then it is fine. But if you want to see Scola's masterpiece properly, get the Eagle Pictures dvd.

&nbsp;This is a small issue, but I later noticed that the Eagle Pictures DVD transfer has one problem: they cropped the short black and white news-footage sequence at the beginning of the film, starting from the jump cut (bomb explodes -> jump cut to news footage). The crop deletes a bit from the top/bottom to fit the footage's 4:3 aspect ratio into the DVD's 16:9 (the Eagle pictures is widescreen and NOT letterboxed). This edition however, which is letterboxed (so technically it is 4:3), does not crop this news-footage section, and it fits the whole 4:3. So this is one tiny ""advantage"" of this release over the otherwise superior Eagle Pictures dvd. What I would suggest, since the great subtitles of this edition are freely available online, get the Eagle Pictures DVD, and watch it with this edition's English subtitles (yes this is possible).",1168646400,14,1373,4.8927038626609445

171275,5,084252455X,"This film is one of the most sincere and haunting films you'll watch in you life. A careful sight into the affective world of three friends, his adventures and livings, until they find casually twenty years later; and the changes produced by the life in what they are, and their useless efforts for trying 'to freeze' the time. Beautifully filmed with surrealistic rapture images.
Manfredi and Gassman were two of the major actors in the italian cinema in any age Watch also for that legendary seductive beauty who was Stephania Sandrelli.
The dazzling script and delightful sequences are feed by a clever sense of humor. It's about the nosthalgical reflections of those years that they'll never come.

171277,5,084252455X,"This movie is one of the most moving love stories ever put on film; all you need to do is to wait until it is released in its entirety. I was stunned when I first saw it in the theatre, and although this was many years ago, I can still remember the emotion it evoked in me and how unique it was, albeit common life situation, the eternal triangle. This involves 2 men and a woman and there are scenes, one in particular, that break your heart.
*WARNING: Possible spoiler...toward the end of the movie they have their pictures taken in a photo booth, and the top pictures show them mugging and smiling; then the tragedy of their situation hits and the girl is shown, on the last frame, with tears and mascara running down her face; this hit me with tremendous impact and I was very moved by it.
Brigham Young University has promised to release this classic in its entirety; I strongly advise you to wait for the uncut version. It is well worth wating for, and on a par with ""Les Enfants du Paradis."" GREAT moviemaking...",1060128000,38,1019,4.396825396825397

7793108,5,084252455X,"An art masterpiece by the recently deceased Ettore Scola, this is a prime example of 70's film making, mixing politics, humour and romance. Definitely not ""a popcorn movie"", so fans of superhero flics would do better to stay away and stick to the teen films of the week.

In this film, every sequence is a classic, every scene a masterclass. A testimony to Scola, who was not as famous outside of Europe as Fellini and Vittorio de Sica, is that both these more famous directors are in the film, playing themselves. A must for European cinema lovers and for those who enjoy watching a movie with strong messages to talk about afterwards.",1457049600,,636,4.678571428571429

7793111,5,084252455X,"I recently watched the Italian film, 'C'eravamo tanto amati' as a rental from facets. It took a while to force myself to watch because I am SO reluctant to watch films that have war scenes. It turns out, this 'war' aspect is inconsequential. It merely provides the information about how these people first met.

When I reluctantly committed to watching, I was bowled over by how great this film is! Truly, it was ahead of its time in so many ways. I wonder how many well-known directors have watched this film and been inspired. The facets copy was a bit 'glitchy' in the sense that I kept being bounced back to the main menu while choosing scenes, but it was a minor problem. I watched the movie in its original Italian with Italian subtitles. Although I'm a native English speaker, I read Italian easily and speak Italian haltingly.

The facets copy also had English subtitles but I did not feel like I needed them. But they are fine to get the gist of the movie.

I would buy this film for the thirty something dollars it costs here on amazon if I knew the film was in Italian. The problem is that it is listed as being in English. Dubbed? That would be horrible. I wouldn't waste money on that.

Why? Because so much of the way the words are spoken is tied to their delivery in this film. The film ends with a very common slang expression that has no translation directly to English, for example, but it expresses a kind of insouciance that tells a lot about the characters who use it and repeat it - on the heels of what just transpired.

So, please, please, amazon, clarify this. I don't think it's worth the puchase price if it is dubbed (always a dicey proposition to dub!)

There are four actors: three men and a woman. You find surprises with each, although their surprises spring directly from their well-developed characters. There are also other people in their lives - who are very entertaining. Elide was one of the most interesting to me - the moment I saw her, I thought a remake would have her played by Mila Kundera. Or a young Marisa Tomei.

I don't want a remake, however - this film is perfect as it is. And I got to see Fellini!",1393545600,,2151,4.416666666666667

We follow the disparate lives of a proletariat, an intellectual, and a bourgeois through their ideals, convictions, loves, triumphs and failures. This cinematic retelling weaves a tapestry of iconic Italian film imagery, including the infamous recreation of 'La Dolce Vita's' Trevi fountain scene, complete with appearances by Fellini and Mastroianni. Dedicated to Vittorio De Sica, this film is a tribute to Italian filmmaking and a testament for film lovers. Bravo!",1280880000,,580,5.455555555555556

7793116,5,084252455X,"This unmitigated joy of a film is truly hilarious, even as parts of it break your heart. It follows the progress of a generation, personified in three wartime buddies who drift apart and then briefly converge again. There is failure, heartbreak, regret, but the message seems to be that love- and friendship- conquer all...that and the movies themselves, as Scola uses the progression of Italian cinema over this fertile period as warm, wonderful seasoning. (In one memorable scene, Antonio's ambulance is delayed in Rome as Fellini and Mastroianni-in delightful cameos-shoot the famous Trevi Fountain scene from ""La Dolce Vita"". Though the quality of the print is not top-notch, it takes little away from all that magic on-screen.",1183420800,,731,5.256410256410256
