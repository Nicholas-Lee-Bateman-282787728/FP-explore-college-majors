Why is it so cool? it has a little bit of everything in it, the 1000 masks gang, coffin gang white ghost gangs, tones of crazy weapons including the blade/baton on the cover. It also has GREAT open hand fights and pole techniques.

It also has funny moments and I am telling you, try this one out, I saw it on
FU-Network when it was on cable and now I am buying it. I was hoping it was in a SB collection, but I don't think so.

check it out!
