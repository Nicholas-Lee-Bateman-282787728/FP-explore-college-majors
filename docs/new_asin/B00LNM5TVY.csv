It is inarguably one the most critically ignored and unrecognized masterpieces of the ""New German Cinema"" Movement of the late 1970's and early 1980's, which produced such extraordinary films as ""The Tin Drum"", ""Our Hitler"", ""Das Boot"", ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"", and ""Mephisto"", and although it was originally conceived as a three-part television series, it can easily stand alongside those feature films in terms of ambition, scope, and emotional impact. Why then, one must ask, has it never been vaunted into that Pantheon of greats, for it certainly deserves to be. Despite whatever inevitable details were sacrificed in adapting such a monumental and philosophically complex literary work, there can be no mistaking the film's ultimate faithfulness to it's myriad themes of social, moral, intellectual, psychological, and political dualities and dissolution, as an idyllic and glacial Swiss Alps sanitarium acts as the symbolic microcosm of a pre-World War One Germany in decline, whose damaged souls recuperate listlessly under the sinister hands of half-mad caretakers hell-bent on establishing any possible manifestations of physical sickness or disease whether it exists or not. It is also noteworthy for one of Rod Steiger's most potent and unseen late-career performances, as an ailing Dutch sensualist painfully aware of the reactionary forces that are implicit in the spiritually dysfunctional and sexually repressed patients who willingly imprison themselves within the clinic's frigid walls, resulting in a fiery ""bird of prey"" monologue that hauntingly alludes to the future specters of Nazism and The Holocaust, and is a chilling testament to Mann's uncanny and frighteningly prescient understanding of the poisonous seeds that would lead to the historic Gotterdammerung of his native homeland, divined through the book's overarching and metaphysical struggle between Eros (the life force) and Thanatos (the death drive) and the unacknowledged and necessary connection between them.  Could it be a coincidence that the obscurity and lack of attention paid to this amazing production just happened to coincide with the early AIDS crisis and the rise of a blatantly puritanical neo-conservatism, when it was released in 1982? It's certainly something to ponder in terms of then...and now. And to all serious viewers with both the patience and commitment to savor and appreciate the nuances and deeper implications of this filmic interpretation, I highly suggest watching any documentaries discussing Mann's personal life, which sheds a great deal of light on his family torments and closeted homosexuality, and discusses how those issues revealed themselves within the worlds of his most famous fictions.",1528156800,2,3018,5.57516339869281
