6602173,5,B00MUNSV3S,"I was very happy with this new grouping of these ten great noirs, all in one place, and at only 6.49 per film, and, I'm sure the price will go down even lower than that! The transfers appear just as good as they have in recent releases of these same films - by both Universal and TCM. The extras listed are exactly as they appear in the product description listed on Amazon for this item. (Strangely, the dvd packaging is rather vague about which films have extras. although it mentions that they are there.)  Only ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Touch of Evil"" are stand-alone discs and the remaining films are two to a disc. Thankfully, Universal has supplied subtitles and SDH for all films - a practice that seemed lost on TCM in their previous releases of some of these titles. Extras that were exclusive to TCM releases are, of course, not on these discs, with the pleasant exception of Robert Osbourne's spoken introduction for ""Double Indemnity."" The packaging involves a slipcover over a standard size dvd case with the same artwork appearing on both. Inside, the discs fit neatly on front and back panels with two double-sided ""flipper"" style holders holding the remaining four discs, so that these ten films take no more room on a shelf than one usual single disc package. There is very little description of the films with the exception of the basic credits for each, available on the flip side of the dvd insert cover. Overall, I found this set very satisfying and would recommend it highly to anyone wishing to acquire these films, or particularly to someone new to Film Noir, as a good jumping off point.",1415491200,52,1611,4.692579505300353

Of course I had seen half the films on this collection, but five were, I think, totally new to me and every single film is a classic.

6602182,4,B00MUNSV3S,"These films vary widely in the ""film noir"" category.  The classic Double Indemnity...well deserved for all its kudos.  This Gun for Hire, very disappointing. Alan Ladd is interesting.  Veronica Lake is a monotone actress.  The Big Clock is a fascist fable with great art deco sets.
The high light for me is Phantom Lady.  It's intriguing from the beginning to the end.  Yes, Franchot Tone's mad act is a overdone to the point of nearly being comical...his speech about hands, his holding his aching head.  I still loved it.  Elsa Raines, Alan Curtis both great.  Great acting from
two lesser known actors. Elisha Cook Jr with Elsa Raines in her tart personna to trying to gain valuable information is perfect.  Her disgust at having
to kiss him is obvious.  The scene with jazz musicians is brilliant.  Very German Expressionist and grotesque.  Note Elsa Raine's throwing back her head and showing teeth as she laughs. Great directing by Richard Siodmark.  Also good is Criss Cross with fine performances by Burt Lancaster and Yvonne DeCarlo as femme fatale.  I love this genre and wanted copies of Double and Criss Cross which I had as VHS.  I watched Phantom Lady again and noticed and heard what I'd missed the first time.  Perhaps it shows changing times that Bosley Crowther panned this film as not credible.  There are many films in which I must suspend disbelief. The premise of Phantom is intriguing and I am caught immediately.  For a film set, the scene on the NYC ""el"" is very evocative of the period and unsettling. The ending may be a little sappy after the suspense but I don't  mind the happy result of Elsa Raine's quest on behalf of the man she loves.",1488153600,,1668,4.705882352941177

6602201,4,B00MUNSV3S,"IMAGE QUALITY: Quite nice. No complaints. SOUND QUALITY: Also very nice. No complaints. FILM COLLECTION: I am pleased with my purchase. The collection is a mixed bag, but, overall, not a bad one. The standout ones for me in this collection are ""Double Indemnity"" (1944) and ""The Killers"" (1946), both noir classics. ""The Killers"" has some noteworthy cinematography, acting, and use of flashback sequences. (I recommend reading some of the top IMDB User Reviews of ""The Killers."") Next in line for me was ""The Big Clock"" (1948), which I found fun. (I subsequently read the novel and liked it, too. I recommend both the movie and the novel.) Then there is the atmospheric Orson Welles film ""Touch of Evil"" (1958). (Im not much of a fan of this one but I recommend reading the Roger Ebert review of ""Touch of Evil."") Then probably ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942). Then ""Black Angel"" (1946) and ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946). Not at all a fan of ""Criss Cross"" (1949). It just didn't do anything at all for me. (""The Killers"" and ""Criss Cross"" are both directed by Robert Siodmak, star Burt Lancaster, and have the same sort of themean otherwise likable, good-natured fella roped into an improbable heist and pulling a double-cross to get the money to get the alluring but materialistic girlbut the former is far superior to the latter in every waycinematography, settings, characters, dialogue, acting, story, creativity, etc. It seems to me like ""Criss Cross"" tried to replicate the success of ""The Killers,"" but fell flat.) I disliked ""The Glass Key"" (1942) and ""Phantom Lady"" (1944). EXTRAS: While only ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Touch of Evil include commentary tracks (with each film having two such tracks), these commentaries shouldn't be missed. Some are more informative and interesting than others, but all are quite good.",1451347200,2,1815,4.993399339933993

These are top of the line of their genre, some are classics (Double Indemnity, The Killers, Touch of Evil) and three pair Alan Ladd & Veronica Lake in their best chemistry together. The transfers are all very good or excellent and Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" is exceptional in this print which restores Welles' original intentions and thus lengthens the film to its longest running time ever. Highly recommended for those who appreciate actors and actresses and detective scripts from the Studio days of Hollywood.

6602210,5,B00MUNSV3S,"Universal digs into the vaults and bring us ten films that immerse us into a world of alienation, despair, cynicism, disillusionment, melancholy, desperation, pessimism, paranoia, moral corruption and ambiguity.

The Film Noir 10 Movie Spotlight Collection gives us a nice mix of major classics of the genre (Double Indemnity, Touch of Evil, Criss Cross, and The Killers), minor classics (This Gun For Hire, The Blue Dahlia, and Phantom Lady), and lesser but very good noir films (The Glass Key, Black Angel, and The Big Clock). The ten movies are spread across six single-sided dvds and packaged in a standard size dvd keepcase. The keepcase has two double-sided hinged trays inside the case for the dvds (no spindles). My copy also had a cardboard slipcover over the case.

The outer case is not clear so here is a a breakdown of the disc contents:

Disc One:
01 This Gun For Hire (1942) is based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun For Sale and stars the classic screen duo of Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake in their first of seven pairings.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean. There are specks of dust here and there but nothing that distracts me from the film.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: A trailer for the film.

02 The Glass Key (1942) is not the 1935 original with George Raft. This remake is based on the novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett and again stars Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake in their second pairing.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean. There are specks of dust here and there but nothing that distracts me from the film.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: None

Disc Two:
03 Double Indemnity (1944) is one of the very best films of the film noir genre. I personally rank it second to only The Maltese Falcon. The film is based on James M. Cains novella of the same name and stars Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Be on the look out for Edward G. Robinson in one of his best roles as a supporting actor. It is amazing to think all three actors were originally not interested in appearing in the film. They all needed to be persuaded to appear in film that turned out to be one of their greatest performances.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks great.

Audio: There are English and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0 mono tracks. They are clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, and French

Extras: This film has a bunch of goodies
* Audio Commentary by Film Historian Richard Schickel.
* Audio Commentary by Film Historians Lems Dobbs and Nick Redman.
* A 2  minute introduction by film historian and host of Turner Classic Movies, Robert Osborne.
* Shadows and Suspense: An excellent 38 minute documentary about the film.
* A trailer for the film.

Disc Three:
04 Phantom Lady (1944) is based on the Cornell Woolrich novel of the same name. He written the novel under the pseudonym William Irish.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and is the worse looking in this set. All of the other films are relatively clean looking but this one is loaded with dust specks and scratches. Some of the scenes are not that bad and others are very dirty and look horrible. Im guessing parts of the film may have been damaged beyond the point of restoration or Universal forgot to clean up this one.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: None

05 The Blue Dahlia (1946) stars Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake in their fifth pairing (the third and final on this set). Be on the lookout for Hugh Beaumont (Leave It To Beaver) in a supporting role.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: None

Disc Four:
06 Black Angel (1946) is based on the Cornell Woolrich novel of the same name. Be on the lookout for the great Peter Lorre as Marko the nightclub owner.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: A trailer for the film.

07 The Killers (1946) is partly based on Ernest Hemingways short story of the same name and stars Burt Lancaster (his film debut), Ava Gardner, and Edmond OBrien.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: A trailer for the film.

Disc Five:
08 The Big Clock (1948) is an adaptation of  the Kenneth Fearing novel of the same name and stars Ray Milland, Maureen O'Sullivan, and the incredible Charles Laughton. Be on the watch for Elsa ' The Bride of Frankenstein' Lanchester.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: None

09 Criss Cross (1949) is probably my second favorite film in this set and easily ranks in my film noir top ten. The film is based on the Don Tracy novel of the same name and stars Burt Lancaster and Yvonne DeCarlo (better known as Lily Munster).

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:33 full frame transfer. The film is in black & white and looks relatively clean.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH

Extras: A trailer for the film.

Disc Six:
10 Touch of Evil (1958) is loosely based on the Whit Masterson novel, Badge of Evil. It stars Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, and Orson Welles. I should note that this is the 1998 restored version of the film. The dvd has a featurette that explains more about this.

Video: The movie is presented in a solid 1:85 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The film is in black & white and looks great.

Audio: The only audio track is English Dolby Digital 2.0 mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, and French

Extras: This film has a bunch of goodies
* Audio Commentary with Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, and restoration producer Rick Schmidlin.
* Audio Commentary with restoration producer Rick Schmidlin.
* Bringing Evil To Life: An excellent 21 minute documentary about the film.
* Evil Lost and Found: An interesting 17 minute feature about the making of this restored version of the film.
 * A trailer for the film.

I really enjoyed this set and highly recommend The Film Noir 10 Movie Spotlight Collection.",1426377600,107,7418,4.58649468892261
6602211,5,B00MUNSV3S,"A superb collection of ""film noirs"", five from Universal and an equal number from Paramount and apart from the 1958 ""Touch of Evil"", all made in the classic and appropriately black and white era of the forties.
Probably only a few outright classics (""Double Indemnity"", ""The Killers"" and ""Touch of Evil"") but all wonderfully well made and intriguing from beginning to end.  Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", one of the all time greats and the Orson Welles more recently reconstructed and rediscovered gem ""Touch of Evil"" both get a single disc while the other eight films are scattered across the other four, two to a disc.  These two are the only ones with significant extras and they are substantial with ""Indemnity"" containing three audio commentaries and a first rate 40 minute documentary. Two separate commentaries accompany ""Evil"" with one featuring the stars Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh and there a couple of short ""making of"" featurettes.
All the films in this collection are stacked with interest, fascination and excitement and they all range from better than good to excellent. They all contain the fine Hollywood craftsmanship of the time, move with style and pace and have storylines which will have you engrossed throughout.
From the stunning debut and early film career of Alan Ladd (matched with the intriguing Veronica Lake) in ""This Gun For Hire"",  ""The Glass Key"" and  ""The Blue Dahlia"" to the powerful screen presence of Burt Lancaster in ""The Killers"" (an astonishing debut performance opposite Ava Gardner) and ""Criss Cross"", these films won't disappoint.  The two Lancaster films were directed by one of the best, if not the best, film noir directors Robert Siodmak, and he is also represented by the 1944 gem ""Phantom Lady"".  This was the real discovery for me: a fantastic thriller with an excellent Ella Raines and with a limited budget, just marvel at the way Siodmak has created it with such marvellous, inventive and stylish filmmaking.  And the unforgettable scene where Elisha Cook Jr. reaches an orgasmic fury during a drum solo is priceless!
To round out this collection, Ray Milland does battle with a couple of newspaper tycoons (the sticky, slimy Charles Laughton and George Macready) in the complicated but fascinating ""The Big Clock"" with Elsa Lanchester as an eccentric painter stealing every scene she's in.  And Roy William Neill getting a break from all those Universal Sherlock Holmes programmers, with ""Black Angel"", beautifully made with a fine performance from Dan Duryea in one of his more sympathetic roles.
An appreciation of fine filmmaking during the studio factory years with not only fine directors and actors but terrific writers (eg Raymond Chandler, W.R. Burnett, Albert Maltz, Jonathan Latimer, Anthony Veiller), outstanding cinematographers (eg John F. Seitz, Russell Metty, Franz Planer) and great music composers  (eg Miklos Rozsa, Victor Young, Henry Mancini) all in collaboration to create  top of the list movies for art and entertainment.",1425427200,29,3008,5.209109730848861
