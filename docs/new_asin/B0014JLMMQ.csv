8255931,3,B0014JLMMQ,"I am a big history buff and have always been fascinated by Roman history so when I saw that this DVD about Pompeii and Herculaneum was available I was very excited. A video that showed not just the ruins, but video interpretations of how they would have looked in their heyday. Unfortunately, the DVD didn't entirely live up to my expectations. The computer generated video elements are quite well done and do give us a glimpse of how the buildings might have looked in the past but I found that the video walk-throughs often went a little too fast for my liking - I would have preferred that they lingered a bit from spot to spot to make it easier to take in all the detail that was included in the walk. The other problem with the video (and this was a bit of a show stopper for me) was the voice-over. There is a narrator speaking through much of the video while some lovely classical music is played in what should be the background. Unfortunately, I believe the music and narration must have been dubbed separately (probably to drop in the English translation of the narration) and the music frequently and effectively drowns out the voice of the narrator. If one tries to turn the sound up loud enough to attempt to hear what the narrator is saying, the music becomes too loud to enjoy. The narration, when one can hear it, is quite good and gives quite a lot of good historical information about the cities but too much of it is lost for me to be able to really enjoy it. All in all, the DVD is worth watching at least once but borrow it from someone or try to buy it used rather than spending the cash on a new copy.",1423180800,2,1624,4.327868852459017
