The movie was also well made with lots of old footage and great accolades from other rock bands (i.e. Metallica, KISS, etc.).  A must see for any Rush fan!",1274832000,12,311,4.166666666666667

4128698,5,B003J27WFW,"I was fortunate enough to be at the premire of this film at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 24 and can only say it blew me away! I've been a Rush fan since Permenant Waves came out in 1980 and thought I knew all there was to know about the band. I was wrong! Rush fans are extremely committed and loyal to the band and will find new information along with old familiar stories throughout the film so, if you're a Rush fan, buy this! If you know a Rush fan, buy it for them!",1272931200,12,476,3.96875
4128699,5,B003J27WFW,"Wow!  What a treat!  Saw this in the theatre at Tribeca Film Festival with a packed crowd.  It was extremely well done -- funny, informative, and all the topics were addressed (from the tragedies to the outrageous clothing styles).  I understand that the DVD may include an extra hour long bonus feature that were not in the theatre release.

Wall Street Journal gave it a great review and the movie won the festival's 2010 Heineken Audience Award.

Lots of great interviews with parents, rock stars, and the band. Quite an enjoyable experience.  A MUST buy for any Rush fan, and a fantastic treat for those of you who just appreciate a great rock documentary.  Will the ROck and Roll Hall of Fame be next? Enjoy....",1272931200,71,716,4.672

4128724,5,B003J27WFW,"This is the very best rock band documentary I have ever seen (and I have seen plenty in my 58 years). Yes, I am a Rush fan, but not a fanatic. The inclusion of footage from their youth and the story of the genesis of the band is outstanding, and really lets you know where they came from. The story of the bands' accomplishments and albums is mixed with their hardships and tragedies. As the movie ends, they are seated around a kitchen table, drinking wine and enjoying each others' company. I truly wish I could join them.",1469923200,,524,4.357142857142857

I mean, their music is interesting and unusual and you would probably still like it even if they were a bunch of jerks, but it is somehow expected that they turn out to be great guys on a personal level too. Typical Canadians.....they don't seem to quite understand how awesome they are, they are rather humble.",1448668800,,481,4.2967032967032965

4128755,5,B003J27WFW,"I tend to like and appreciate documentaries, especially ones like these. Long story short, Banger Films did a very thorough job on this one. Rush have long been shrouded in mystery regarding their roots and Sam Dunn and his crew did a fantastic job going all the way to the beginning to present day on many peoples favorite band. Whether you like a documentary or not, this is a great tale and very informative and entertaining.",1442275200,,428,4.644736842105263

4128760,5,B003J27WFW,"Even if you're someone who feels, genuinely, that they don't like Rush, this documentary may dispel that feeling. I just got done watching this and, though I have been a Rush fan since hearing the first notes of ""The Spirit of Radio"", this documentary really opened up a whole new world of appreciation for the band. I read Neil Peart's books long before seeing this documentary, with ""Ghost Rider"" specifically resonating with me insofar as the need to ride as a way to clear my head and deal with difficult situations, but also being able to cope with, and come to grips with, the loss of a loved one. This film, beyond that, truly invoked a new appreciation for Rush, for all they have done, and all they will create and achieve in the years to come.

This is a documentary worth watching, if for no other reason than for your love of music itself.",1439510400,,851,4.490322580645161

4128766,5,B003J27WFW,"I was a relative newcomer as a Rush fan. I became interested at my daughter's urging, fell in love with the then current Tom Sawyer era of their development. My daughters and I have shared since 3 concerts, and were sad we could not get tickets to their recent last show. This charming and insightful movie was very revealing to me, not only at the vast expanse of variation in their music, but also their guts to stick with what they meant to do, and their friendship.  I am very thankful, especially to Neil, for their candid and thoughtful interview responses.  Respect!",1436745600,2,573,4.607843137254902
4128767,5,B003J27WFW,"Sam Dunn does a fantastic job in this multi-focal display of everything that is RUSH. I'm ashamed to say, at 51, the Rush R40 tour (June 19 ,2015-at Toronto's Air Canada Centre) was my first, and only LIVE concert of the greatest Rock band on the planet. Watch this DVD then, RUSH out (sorry) and buy ALL of their non-idiomorphic, powerful, and unmistakeably unique, original sounding albums and DVDs. I hope they come back at least once more for another tour. One concert is not enough for me for RUSH. Their show, this past month, displayed ALL of the energy of the clips you will see in ""BEYOND the LIGHTED STAGE"", even though this 2-DVD set shows RUSH from their inception (""where can I get that new Led Zeppelin album ? Nope, that was not a new Led Zeppelin album, that is a song called WORKING MAN from a new CANADIAN band called RUSH"" !!!) to their prolific, present day sounds and achievements. You WILL be hooked and watch this DVD over and over. RUSH is, and always has been truly Canadian. Humble. Meek (""for the meek shall inherit the earth- 2112: a BLOW YOU AWAY album""). Hard working. And always TRUE to THEMSELVES (they NEVER sold-out to the main-stream or producers or critics etc....they wrote and played what THEY and their true FANS wanted). I have played ""BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE"" with non-RUSH fans and yes, regrettably I must be honest and say there are one or two out there. After the first 5 minutes of watching this DVD, something visceral happens to them, and they become one of MANY+++, a RUSH ""Freaking-Geek-Fan"". It's ALL good with RUSH. You'll see....

But then again I think there is something for everyone to relate to in this rockumentary masterpiece. I won't ruin the story by telling you what happens but I think you already know. Anyone that's listened to Rush and has been their fan knows their story. Still, this is a great story about three men and a journey that we all can admire. There are elements of the typical rock and roll life of youngsters that want to rock, but with theses guys it's a little different. They are not after drugs or fame, they just want to live their art. They are so humble and the friendship they have with each other has such great loyalty that they could never leave the band. I think if you love these guys and haven't seen it, or are new to them and want to learn more about them, then totally check this out! Also, the bonus DVD has some cool coverage of some concerts and other stuff. Real people, real music, and real life.

I dunno.).. the writing emo... the philosophy ok I guess... but really man, couldn't you go deep? Why is it so sunny? In the wrong places. You know what I mean. O yes u do. Really I've never listened to a complete Rush record... but I do tap my foot when Tom Sawyer is played on KLOS... the critics are idiots, so what, so what? You guys made money and it held you back... the drummer could've really let himself go and write that masterpiece for himself and then noone else would've shook their head in dismay (and read it all) and get it a thousand years later....(well 165 years later anyway)... man, I'm so disappointed... why O why didn't you go deep.. On this. You'll be dead soon enough... nothing matters... but Your Art and what you leave behind. Is This It? I'm mad because I realize how much you could've done (and haven't yet... and probably never will,not unlike me in fact). I plan on deleting this review, its awful.

4128806,5,B003J27WFW,"Beyond the Lighted Stage isn't your typical rock band documentary; it does more than just tell a story. While watching this fantastic documentary, I was in awe at how these guys conduct themselves, either on the stage or off. For those who already know a great deal of their history, there have never been stories of a band member (or members) trashing their hotel room with a sledgehammer, scandals, drug busts, or anything else that is pretty typical of rock stars. Geddy, Alex, and Neil are well-spoken, not arrogant, and just 'regular guys' who love to make music for their fans, who, by the way, are the most loyal you'll ever see. Why does Rush have such a loyal fan base? Perhaps it's because Rush have been slighted by critics and kicked around for 40 years, which doesn't sit well with fans. Or, it could be that fans respect their unwillingness to cave into being something they're not, such as 'selling out' for the record company or to the tune of way more money via chart-topping hits. Even after the very precarious period (1975) of not selling many copies of Caress of Steel, they still stuck to their guns and made another epic-length piece (2112). When this album became successful, people started to realize that these guys are real. Finally, I think that Rush fans are endeared to the band because they're there for the fans. Because of everything I mentioned, it's no mystery as to why they've lasted so long together. Most bands are lucky to log 10 years, but Rush has logged more than 40, and are still going strong. The documentary starts with the early childhood of Geddy, Alex and John (Rutsey), the original drummer. They epitomize the grassroots struggle of a local band finding their way in a market (Canada) that wasn't conducive to being noticed by U.S. Labels. Then, via a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio, they got their first break (because of a DJ's bathroom break) when the song Working Man was played. After this, people wanted to hear Rush. Subsequently, the newly-found attention would be the beginning of the end for John Rutsey, who suffered from diabetes, so touring wasn't an option due to his health. Neil Peart auditioned and was given the job, but his presence and songwriting transformed the band into full-fledged progressive rock. I think of Neil Peart as a symbol of quiet confidence; he gave the image of someone who was above all the rock culture nonsense and criticism that's so prevalent even to this day. I've never known him to say,  ""how come we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"" His band mates had the same attitude. Rush have always wanted to be themselves, which alienated critics. But music is about fans and gold and platinum records- NOT what Rolling Stone magazine says. Rolling Stone has finally given Rush their due, most likely because they don't want to lose fans who like Rush. This documentary also touches on tragic events in Peart's life which sidelined the band indefinitely. Rush is a band of attrition, perseverance, and resilience. When they returned to action, they were bigger than ever, thanks to old fans and new legions of fans. This two CD set is a must-have for anyone who appreciates a great story about a great band. The second disc has concert footage included.",1418860800,,3255,4.750883392226148

4128817,5,B003J27WFW,Excellent DVD about this band and gave me a new appreciation for Neil Pert who is often painted as an introvert who doesn't like his fans.  He's just not one to idolize people (he was a fan of Keith Moon's but would never even think of approaching or stalking him).  Great video even if you are not a fan of RUSH as it really gets to the heart of band dynamics.,1414108800,,361,4.070422535211268
4128818,5,B003J27WFW,This is a very enjoyable documentary of Rush from when they started till a few years ago. I did not know a lot about the band appart from the fact they are from Canada.

Great insight into the guys, their records, and the overall history of one of the best rock bands to ever exist. Interviews by Billy Corgan, Jack Black, Les Claypool, Gene Simmons, and many others is the icing on the cake. Can't say enough good things about this documentary. The second after I hit stop I fired up some La Villa Strangiato and got my Rush on.",1403740800,,532,4.2254901960784315
4128826,5,B003J27WFW,"This documentary covers Rush from the very beginning through Snakes & Arrows and does a superb job of it. Teenage footage of them playing with John Rutsey, getting Neil on drums, touring with Kiss, early disappointments and the near end of the band before 2112, it's all here.

Following 2112 this awesome documentary continues album by album to the present with a plethora of guest appearances from managers, producers, fans, and musicians. Some, like Gene Simmons were welcomed by me, and others like Jack Black, Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan, and others were utter blasphemy to the Rush legacy.

But even so, this documentary was beyond fantastic. There is seriously rare footage that will serve as a visual representation of what has only been available in print for all these years.",1401840000,,784,5.023076923076923
4128827,5,B003J27WFW,...I have ever seen. The depth of the subject and the videos of these guys playing in the early 70's in high school was unbelievable. Even Alex's home footage from his dinner table with the folks was really cool. The complete history of RUSH and the guests comments are spot on. This is one of those documentaries that is so engrossing that when it was over I couldn't believe time had passed that fast. They also have a great sense of humor which helps carry it along. Love it!!,1400976000,,479,4.393258426966292

4128829,5,B003J27WFW,"I've been a Rush fan since I first heard 'All The World's A Stage' Rush's first live album in 1976. Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.

Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.

I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.

I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to ""rush"" by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.

The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.

I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately. If you love Rush(and I know you do!) this is a must own set",1399507200,,2905,4.293795620437956
4128830,5,B003J27WFW,"I originally caught this on one of the Fios network channels and immediately knew I had to have it. Ironically, this was released before their induction into the Rock and Roll hall of fame, which is kind of a thread through the video clips and interviews.

As a life-long Rush fan, and seeing them many times, I still learned so much about a band I grew up with and thought I knew well. Any Rush fan needs to have this DVD in their library, it doesn't disappoint!",1399248000,,463,4.32183908045977
4128831,5,B003J27WFW,"This documentary really gives insight into the lives, personalities and workings of this band.  Not only does Rush have legions of fansthey are respected by so many big time musicians.  More proof that the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame will never be legit for the simple reason that they snubbed Rush.",1398384000,,296,4.673076923076923
4128832,5,B003J27WFW,"After watching this excellent biography of Rush, I now realize the extent of the camaraderie that has kept them together through thick and thin. I was also provided with insights into their characters that I was not fully aware of, adding yet another facet to a group that I thought I knew inside and out.

The care and attention that went into making this film is nothing short of spectacular; the sound quality is excellent and the interviews with the band members were generally insightful.  Of the three members, I found myself relating to Neil Peart the most, and no, I don't regard him as a sourpuss because he values his privacy.  His lyrics have been an inspiration ever since I started listening to the group, and his drumming is, well, mind-blowing. Come to think of it, I might pick up his book Ghost Rider, which chronicles the road he traveled (literally and figuratively) while recovering from the tragic loss of his wife and child.

The film is laid out chronologically and nicely illustrates the changes that their music went through decade after decade. At the beginning, there is some cool footage of Alex Lifeson having a passionate discussion with his parents recorded sometime in the early 1970s- it paints a nice picture of an idealistic and principled young man. The film then progresses through their career, and the viewer is treated to live performances, excellent insights from producer Terry Brown, and tidbits on the recording process. Overall, the emphasis was on the 1970s material, and to a lesser extent the synth-heavy albums of the 1980s. My general impression was that the albums from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s were somewhat glossed over, with the exception of Vapor Trails, which was the big comeback for Neil.

There are also interviews with various musicians (Kiss, Uriah Heep, Max Webster, Dream Theater, Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, Foo Fighters, Sebastian Bach, Tool, Nine Inch Nails) and actors (Jack Black). Although I found the commentaries from the musicians and actors useless - OK, I will admit that Gene Simmons [Kiss] was pretty funny and the guy from Uriah Heep cracked me up-some of the interviewees did give you an idea of the broad spectrum of younger musicians that Rush influenced and continue to influence.

The overall vibe that I got from the film was that the guys in Rush care very much for each other and are sympathetic to the needs of each; this became especially apparent when the personal losses of Neil Peart are discussed.  I also got the sense that while excellent musicians, they were very much down to earth; there are no huge egos on display here and Neil can almost be self-effacing at times. One other thing that I found refreshing was that there was not an emphasis on drug/alcohol use.  Although the use of alcohol is briefly mentioned, there was too much going on in a typical Rush piece for them to go on stage with their senses dulled. As such, drug use does not play a role in the story of Rush.

All in all, this is one of the finest rock biographies I have ever watched and brought back some great memories of watching them in concert circa 1980-1981.  It focuses on the facts and the music; there is no drama, no ridiculous ""arty"" imagery, and no hysterical interviewers. Above all else though, this biography was just plain fun. So much fun in fact, that I have watched it well over ten times.",1397260800,,3406,4.767402376910017

4128847,5,B003J27WFW,"I really enjoyed this excellent 'peek through the window' of a very private group of musicians: Their friendship, respect and dedication to guarding one another's privacy has kept them grounded through the trials and tribulations of life while trying to balance meteoric fame against reality.

Make no mistake, this is not a concert video like RUSH in RIO.  It is a documentary as the title claims: ""BEYOND the Lighted Stage,"" not ""ON the Lighted Stage,"" as some have registered disappointment that there weren't extensive performance films included.

This is the story of RUSH, shared by the band and with commentary by people they've admired and influenced alike.  How they began, survived touring, dealt with the record company and broke barriers to become one of the only groups to record music that they want to play, not what they are assigned to produce by the studio.

Plenty of interesting stories interwoven with humor, poignancy and real familial warmth among the RUSH community; Lee, Lifeson, Peart and their families.

I think that one of the reasons RUSH has such a loyal fan base is not only that they are masters of their craft, but that they are good people as ""...Philosophers and ploughmen each must know his part, to sow a new mentality closer to the heart...""

A great choice for anyone interested in RUSH, music, publishing, producing...",1382486400,,1359,4.986725663716814

You want to punch him...Not just because he's a tool, but because he does know so much about the band you love, and you can't bring yourself to admire him for his vast knowledge.

Fear not...No need to feel inadequate.  I have found the great equalizer.  Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage lets you in to almost every dirty little secret you would ever want to know about ""The Stooges"" told by the boys themselves.

Some of the highlights include:
- Rush playing to a bunch of preteens who smile politely and clap while secretly asking themselves WTF is up with this band?
- What were the boys doing in their hotel rooms during their tour with Kiss while Gene Simmons was bedding everthing with two legs?
- What were the boys smoking when they made Caress of Steel?
- How the Band got their break because some program director in Cleveland was searching for a track to play while her DJ's answered the call of nature.
- How the professor went from an International Harvester Tractor Parts Manager to one of the greatest drummers ever to grace the planet.
- Laugh while you watch a pimply faced Alex Lifeson try to justify to his parents why he should quit high school and skip ""University"" because he DOESN'T want to drive around in a big car and make lots of money...(good one Alex...I'll help you take some of that evil moola off your hands).
- See the boys in their ridiculous Kimono phase and get a load of Alex's Flock of Seagulls inspired hair lick.
- Find out the origins of Rush's brief foray into Rap music and did they just say ""kick some Gluteus Max!!!???""
- Rare footage of Neal Peart actually smiling.  Yes folks you heard it right.  The professor not only smiles but laughs as well.  So much for the Neil Peart is an android theory.  Put away the Voigt-Kampf test Deckard, Neil is not a Replicant....He just plays like one...

All these nuggets and countless more are available at your fingertips

On a more serious note, you will get to know the lives of these three amazing musicians and how they have managed to stay life long friends amid great personal tragedy.

This movie is an unflinching look at one of the most marginalized bands in the late 20th century and how after nearly 40 years, these guys continue to pack stadiums and while others are resting on their laurels, these guys still manage to put out more and more original content.

You don't have to be a Rush fan to enjoy this movie, but after watching it you are likely to become one.

That's ok...Jump on the bandwagon that many of us have been on for sometime.  There's plenty of room, and these guys totally deserve it.",1382313600,14,2797,4.54183266932271

No other band has had the staying power of Rush, who remains relevant and creative after nearly 4 decades with the same three musicians. Also clearly shows how genuinely freindly they are, to fans and each other. They are the classiest, most talented, and most celebrated trio in rock history, and this is a fine tribute.

There are several interesting interviews with band members. Additionally, you get a few snippets of the boys playing in high school gyms, etc and lots of excerpts from older songs and some videos.

This is an opportunity to learn a lot about the band and the individual members, including what happened to the original drummer (that's right, it wasn't Neil).

I almost wonder if the release of this movie was the final push to get these guys into the Rock Hall Of Fame. What a shame that Rush was not celebrated and recognized at this elite level about 20 years ago. They are without peers in all music genre's.

Having been a devoted fan since 1981, it answered many questions, evoked endless smiles and created a connection and an understanding.  The interviews done by other artists are perfect in explaining the level of talent that is so incredibly rare to see in individual musicians that the fact that the three members of Rush came together nearly 40 years ago and have stayed together, and evolved musically is unique to them alone.  If you aren't a Rush fan, then you probably aren't a formally studied musician.

4128890,4,B003J27WFW,"""Rush Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is a very well made and entertaining documentary.  The interviews with the band's members are very well done and informative.  Being a Rush fan for close to three decades I was not disappointed.  I especially liked seeing such extensive interviews with drummer Neil Peart.  It was wonderful seeing the very private and anti-social man break his silence and open up to his legions of fans.  It was very nice to see him so relaxed in those interviews given the fact that he is very uncomfortable giving them.

The producers of the documentary do a very good job with laying out the story of the band.  From their humble beginnings in Willowdale Canada to their first live performances with original drummer the late John Rutsey to their American debut.  The interviews with the band's management and producers add to the entertainment value of this documentary.  The interviews are very insightful and do a good job advancing the story.

I very much enjoyed listening to how the band's musical style has evolved over the years.  What I especially enjoyed is how they stood up to their record company when they were told to make drastic changes in their style after the disappointing sales of ""Caress of Steel"".  That segment showed very well how much they band loves what they do and were determined to keep their style of music their own no matter what the cost.

By far the best part of the documentary is the part that shows how Neil dealt with the horrible personal tragedies in his life in 1997 and 98.  The interviews with Neil were just amazing.  You can feel the emotion coming through the screen as he described his travels on his journey of healing.  What was also just as good was the interviews with Geddy and Alex as well as the band's manager.  The sadness they felt for their colleague and good friend is just as emotional.  What is especially commendable is that everybody respected Neil's wishes and allowed him to take as much time as he needed to recover from the tragedies (If he would ever completely recover is unlikely and that is perfectly understandable.) without any concern for Rush or music for that matter.  The segment ends perfectly with footage of the band's first live performance since Neil's return on the Vapor Trails tour.

The documentary concludes with terrific footage of Rush together in a small resturant.  You can clearly see how true their friendship is and despite describing themselves as goofy and odd, they really are just three good guys who love each other and what they do.

The only criticism I have is that I think the documentary focused too much on interviews with other musicans and celebrities and their adulation for the band.  I understand the reason for having the interviews because it shows the impact Rush has had, but I think it was a little too much.  Especially Jack Black singing a few bars of ""The Spirit of Radio.""  I could have done without that.

However this is just a small flaw in an otherwise very well made documentary.  It is well worth seeing.",1346025600,2,3051,4.718336483931947
4128891,5,B003J27WFW,"It would help to know a little of Rush's music and some of their history, but it's not essential.  The story of Getty Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neal Peart is one of unshakable determination and extremely uncompromising integrity.  Inspiring anecdotes fill the documentary, like when Neil said that they were going to do their next record [Hemispheres] the way they wanted to even if that meant not reaching a wider audience, losing their record contact and ending up back at their ""day jobs"".  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect I found was the very deep and respectful commentary from artists such as Billy Corgan and Trent Reznor (two artists I did't particularly care for - but have a new found respect for).  This documentary was a complete joy to watch from start to finish.  The inevitable discussion of Neal Peart's tragic few years in the late 90's was very sad to watch, but the story of their friendship and how the band came around to continue was amazing.  The restaurant scene at the end was hilarious and pretty much sums up why I think they've been together for 40 years. SEE IT!!
I saw this on Showtime, but just ordered it on Blu-ray from Amazon.  I'll edit my review with specifics on the Blu-ray version (which I don't seem to see much discussion on).",1345852800,,1265,4.645739910313901

Neal is literally a brainiac. A symphonic orchestra should have him narrate and play the drum parts of Peter And The Wolf By Prokofiev.

I had no idea that the band took a long break because of Neal's wife and daughters death.

So I don't spoil this, this is a very well done documentary by one of the most important bands in Rock History.

Some of the extras take the bakery for me...like when they are eating dinner, getting hammered drinking wine and laughing like there's no tomorrow!!!

I just think it's very refreshing to see a band that's survived for so long, enjoyed so much success and not have it go to their heads. It was also nice to see other musician's praising the band as well - Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) was incredibly articulate and entertaining! Rush is comprised of 3 very talented, intelligent and just plain NICE guys! If you like quality rock music and you're not in a better mood by the end of ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" - then you should seek professional help! :-)",1343606400,,756,4.478260869565218

4128900,5,B003J27WFW,"I've always liked Rush, but haven't gone to extreme lengths to track down information about them. I enjoy the music and often find myself wondering about how they create music and what drives them. In my mind I had come to believe that they always play every note flawlessly and that they lived in an ivory tower and sprinkled perfect songs onto the rest of us. It's nice to see them as silly, nerdy, socially awkward human beings who even have trouble playing their most ambitious music at times.
This documentary spends quite a bit of time on the early years, focusing most of its attention on the albums that are dear to every Rush fan...and thankfully devotes very little time to the years when they kinda went off the rails. I enjoyed every minute of the movie and immediately watched all the special features, which I never do.

I really recommend Beyond the lighted stage to everyone, even if you're not familiar with the music from this Canadian trio.
Thank you, Rush! You've been making great honest rock, and Geddy, Alex and Neil are great honest human beings too.",1320105600,,555,4.616161616161616
4128902,5,B003J27WFW,"I've been a Rush fan for most of my life, but since I've not been an avid all-time Rush fan, I've often missed what the band means to me. I go through Rush phases, particularly when they have an interesting new CD/DVD set, but I don't listen to them all the time any more.

I recently borrowed from a friend Beyond The Lighted Stage, the 2010 Rush documentary by Scot MacFayden and Sam Dunn (the directors of ""Metal: A Headbangers Journey"", ""Global Metal"" and the ""Flight 666' Iron Maiden documentary; Scot, apparently, grew up not far from me and went to high school with close friends of mine) because I had to experience for myself this incredible rock `n' roll journey by one of the most long-lasting bands around (only the Stones have existed longer as a unit, but with more lineup changes). It's been the same three guys since 1975, although Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee have been playing in bands since 1968.
The key themes of the movie are, of course, friendship, musicianship, development, passion, and (bad) fashion. It charts the history of the band, with key moments being when the directors bring the members of Rush back to the places where they started out - the church, where they played their first gig, they return to for the first time since they played there in 1968.

The films starts off with scenes of the band warming up, of Neil throwing a drumstick into the air and then dropping it (rare - how often would that happen?) and then goes quickly into celebrity interviews: Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Kirk Hammett of Metallica (who couldn't believe that the band could produce so much sound with only three members when he first heard them), Tim Commerford of Rage Against The Machine, Jason McGem of Death Cab For Cutie, Vinnie Paul of Pantera, Zakk Wylde, Les Claypool of Primus, Dana Carey of Tool, Matt Stone of South Park, Taylor Hawkings of Foo FIghters, Jimmy Chamberlin of Smashing Pumpkins, Sebastian Bach of Skid Row (who claims to be Member #3 of some Toronto-based Rush fan group), Jack Black (who gives multiple funny speeches, such as the one about rock sauce), Gene Simmons (""There's no other way to describe Rush than just... Rush.""), and Billy Corgan, who notes that the Beatles and the Stones (the only other bands Rush can be compared with) have been over-explained... but not Rush.

But hey - where's Marilyn Manson?

The film goes into historical mode, explaining that the parents of Geddy Lee (nee Gary Lee Weinrib) were both Polish Holocaust survivors (here's where the similarities to Robb Reiner, the drummer of Anvil, and a key player in the other great Canadian rock `n' roll documentary, come in) who relocated to Willowdale, a suburb of Toronto, where they were one of the first Jewish families. Geddy's dad died when he was 12, meaning that he had to go into 11 months of mourning. Geddy's mom, Mary Weinrib, talked about Geddy as a kid (the nickname/stage name ""Geddy"" came from her pronunciation of Gary through her thick Polish accent; he's since had his name legally changed to Geddy). The story covers how Geddy met Alex Lifeson in high school, there are plenty of cool pictures of Geddy and Alex as young shorthairs together in school (incidentally, Rick Moranis was their classmate, a fact that probably led to their collaboration with Geddy on ""Take Off"", the hit single of the Bob And Doug MacKenzie  album ""The Great White North"").

Alex seems to have had a relatively steady upbringing, his parents both having immigrated from Yugoslavia, dad had been in a prison camp. The film interviews his mom, Melanija Zivojinovich. Both kids got guitars from their moms, Alex was promised his if he brought home good grades, which was no problem as he was a teacher's pet and was a master schmoozer. Geddy and Alex shared the same grade nine homeroom. First gig was in a church basement in September 1968, the drop-in centre called The Coffin, they got $10, having played to 35 kids, went to eat at Panzer's Deli. Scenes of Sam The Record Man and A&A Records on Yonge Street, discussion of the Yorkville scene (see also Neil Young's Archives 1), and the local hit band The Poppers. Ray Danniels got them as a manager, saw them as talented 16-year-olds who could play a high school circuit with drummer John Rutsey (1953-2008). Pic of three of them in their undies, very early footage, nice red and white star shirt, playing in basement. Alex quit school in grade 12, there's a high quality video of him talking to his parents about his decision, sitting with a girlfriend at the kitchen table talking about it - it looks staged, but that is because it is from a 1972 scare movie about teen pregnancy and school-leavers called ""Come On Children"" from 1972).

There had been a turning point in the Toronto band scene in 1971 when the drinking age was dropped to 18. Yorkville's cafes, hippy and revolutionary, were shut down, and good-time rock `n' roll was encouraged for a rockin' younger drinking crowd. The film quotes famous Canadian musician Kim Mitchell talking about the scene. Rush was playing six nights a week, at places like Abbey Road pub. ""Garden Road"", a never-released song from that era, is played in the movie. The band put together their own first album, and it was heard in the US, where it got attention. ""Rush"" was the perfect album for Cleveland in 1974, especially songs like ""Working Man"", which resonated with many Clevelanders (is it a coincidence that their new live CD ""Time Machine"" was recorded there?). The phones lit up with people calling in to ask for the record, thinking it was the new Led Zeppelin release. There was no record industry in Canada at that time, only outposts. John Rutsey was more into Bad Company, Geddy and Alex were into Yes and Genesis and Pink Floyd. John not healthy enough to tour, would have been okay for the home circuit. So, with a US tour coming up, they looked for a new drummer.

Neil Peart was from a farm in Hayville, cursed by skating on ankles, learned to knit because it was a challenge, suffered physical abuse in the smoking area as a result of being a bit weird and growing his hair longish. Drumming became an instrument of self esteem. The footage shows both parents, who were supportive of his career in music. Was in a band called JR Flood, playing the double bass drum even then. Dad encouraged Neil to audition for Rush in Ajax. Geddy thought Neil was goofy, Alex thought he was not cool enough for Rush. Then he played... ""He was so good!"" Mullet man. First tour was opening for Manfred Mann and Uriah Heep. Mick Box of Uriah Heap loved them.  Eleven days on, one day off, brutal schedule. The film shows posters of their bills with the New York Dolls, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Rory Gallagher, Rod Stewart and the Faces, Montrose, KISS (who loved them, playing 50-60 shows together - the two bands got close). Geddy says that there was no harder working band then KISS, he said it was ""fun to watch their hotel"". Two-band pic with big ""happy birthday"" cake, KISS in make-up, Rush just in jeans. Kim Mitchell's story about the lady's bowling league staying on the same floor as Rush and partying harder than these boys. Neil very literate, opinionated, weird, serious, always the new guy, buying a lot of books, a reader. The band worked on songs after shows. ""By-Tor"" the start of thematic stuff. Audiences got smaller and smaller, toured with Ted Nugent on Caress of Steel when he was also a small act, depressing tour. The discussion of 2112 begins at 37-minute mark of the DVD, the band says that they felt at the time that 2112 may have been their last hurrah, despite pressure to become a rock/pop band, they were determined to go out guns blazing.

Billy Corgan describes how he once could play all of Side 1 of 2112, the release also encouraged a 12-year old Sebastian Bach to go out and buy Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead, to which the LP had been dedicated. ""2112 bought us our independence,"" they realised (""We have assumed control"", the final words of Side 1 of 2112 really carry new meaning!). Critics hated it. ""Unintentionally funny."" ""A cancerous network of haphazard key and time signature changes."" ""Smug, hypocritical, pseudo-symbolic drivel."" ""Flagrantly derivative music."" Constant insults from media, but not from fans. ""Best band in the galaxy"" the posters at shows said, with the 2112 back patch on thousands of jean jackets. A people's band. Canadian VJ JD Roberts gives his comments, now and also from '80s footage. No fashion clue. In San Francisco they found kimonos. First UK tour, where they actually charted!  Nice shots of a Hammersmith Odeon marquee, Rush with Max Webster opening. Geddy and Alex at this point both with double-necked guitars (SG and Rickenbacher). UFO made fun of them - furry slippers nailed to the stage, calling Geddy ""Glee"" (oh how ironic now). With ""Hemispheres"" they embraced long songs, recorded in Wales, experimenting. Determined to record La Villa Strangiata in one take. The song made a huge impression on Kirk Hammet, who called them the high priests of conceptual metal (a title, I suppose that Metallica now owns, having become a less rockin' band than Rush now is, a poor man's Rush of sorts). Various musicians explain that Rush was a musician's benchmark of sorts - if you could recreate Rush, you would be ready for anything. Jack Black explains meeting the band, first Alex and Geddy, then... the master, who is ""eerily precise. If you went in with a computer, Neil Peart would be right on the beat to an atom."" The band played 200 concerts a year, and at one point 17 one-nighters in a row.

Babies started to arrive, the band felt that they couldn't be selfish any more, and began recording bringing the family closer to the process. But they had their biggest successes in front of them. The band is very family-oriented - Alex married in his teens and had kids early, he introduced Geddy to his wife. Cool pic of Neil wearing an FM t-shirt. Permanent Waves was an important stepping stone, there would have been no Moving Pictures without Permanent Waves. Hemispheres was recorded in La Studio, a happy time with family. Concert audiences doubled with 2112, the band shifted from a theatre band at the start of the tour to doing stadium gigs at the end. Three nights at Maple Leaf Gardens. ""Moving Pictures"" made them what they are, Neil said that it was a mixed blessing, strange people came out of the woodwork. There's a scene of a fan approaching Alex and Geddy in a cafe that brought tears to my eyes, I was sniffing and near-blubbering - I started wondering what thoughts would come to my mind, what overflowing emotions would come unbottled, if I came across Alex and Geddy somehow, somewhere the way this waitress did when they wandered into her establishment (which, I think, is Pedro's, the spot where Panzer's Deli had once been, as shown in the outtakes section). And, oddly enough, I think that the last two times that I was overcome by emotion, Rush was involved (the R30 DVD, and also buying Alex Lifeson's ""Limelight"" instructional video). Neil struggles around fans, not comfortable. Fans are so different, hardcore fans of old, male, very intense. Billy Corgan recounts tale of playing ""Entre Nous"" to his mom, as a way to reach out to her. Jack Black: ""They had honesty and integrity, which was in short supply."" Christopher Schreberger, fan (yes, they interviewed fans for this DVD too, but only a few), noted that ""Subdivisions"" really related to him... because he lived in a subdivision (ooohhh... aaaahhhh). Terry Date was the fourth member of Rush. Peter Colilns, a pop producer, was brought in for the next album, ""Grace Under Pressure"". Neil: ""No protective nature of what Rush was."" Alex"" ""Hard to work with keyboards on Power windows."" Geddy: Hold Your Fire pushed them far away from Rush. Rupert Hine brought them back to power trio mode. Counterparts had more hair on it.  Neil worked with Freddie Gruber on jazz drumming for a Buddy Rich tribute that meant re-learning the motion of the hands and feet of drumming. Taps drums two ways. Neil turned grip around. Test For Echo. ""Ghost Rider."" When Neil suffered a double tragedy, they were so worried about him, he disappeared on a road trip, friends and family formed a network to update each other as to when they'd hear from him. Alex lost interest in music as well even, for one year not picking up his instrument at all. Landscapes, highways and wildlife revived Peart. The band have 6,000 nicknames for each other, he sent lifelines signed as one or the other of these nicknames. Had to stop moving before he could think about doing it again. Slow process to get his chops back. Pure and truthful energy on Vapour Trails. Amazed at the Sao Paolo show, when 60,000 fans showed up. The band appeared on the Colbert Report, interviewed and supported by a new generation of entertainers as the real thing. ""The people have generally, consistently voted for them."" Billy Corgan very intelligent comments. Geddy reading ""The Sound And The Fury"" on a flight (brave man - I couldn't get into it at all). ""We had our own stream, and it wasn't the main one, but it wasn't too far away,"" says Geddy Lee. Nonetheless, they actually have a devoted following, people turn their kids on to Rush. ""There's a comfort to know that those same three guys are out there. It's also special to see three guys who can tolerate each other after all these years and make good music,"" says Les Claypool. ""They're on a righteous path,"" Trent Reznor.

The extras are also very good: Long scenes of reminiscing around the Fisherville Junior High School, running greaser gauntlet at the bus stop, built snow man on the front lawn, rode a bike because it was the only mode of transport. Riding around Toronto. First time back to The Coffin since their gig there. Gas station Geddy used to work at. Pantzer's now Anton's. Les Claypool first concert was Rush, Hemispheres tour, Pat Travers Band opened up, he was 14 years old. All of Hemispheres was recorded a semi-tone too high for Geddy's voice. Alex plays golf on days off. ""Birds chirping, horses neighing, bones cracking. Golf is about tempo and rhythm and not trying too hard, not getting in the way of your swing, much like playing an instrument, just let your instinct take over and play."" Geddy collects art, baseballs - players and presidents. Neil - model car building, cycling, reading. Motorcycles. Practicing throwing stick up in the air. Rush Con 7 - Rush trekkies. Rush karaoke and Guitar Hero. Guy with Queens of the Stone Age t-shirt. ""Kim Mitchell, Helix and Rush, nice camera, eh,"" that must be the directors improvising. Alex doing ole honkin' blues in a backstage warm-up. ""Working Man"" with John Rutsey at a high school show doing the intros from behind the drum kit, great, except for Alex's music notes shirt. Groovy ""La Villa Strangiata"" cuts, off funky intro. Dedicated ""Between The Sun And Moon"" to John Entwistle, first time they ever played it, in 2002. Twelve minutes of dinner conversation with Rush. Geddy calls Alex ""Lerx"" in conversation. ""I've got my notepad here."" Neil's drunken laugh. Alex playing a Telecaster, looking very David Gilmour. Commentary on Neil Peart's outrageous mustaches.

I am happy that this movie exists, for people like me to remember what a great band this is, and to set the record straight. This is also an important movie for the masses, Rush fans and non-fans alike - people who are not Rush fans and are perplexed why their friends like Rush so much, for example, watch the movie and they finally get it.

At the same time, however, I'm confused why this film was made. Here you've got guys who have everything - they have fame, they have fortune, they have friendship, they have a massive fan base, they have achieved anything a musician can achieve (except, maybe, admission into the Rock `n' Roll Hall Of Fame, whatever that means); they are private people; why do they need this? Did they agree to do this for the fans?  The fans know everything that there is to know about Rush anyway, much more than is in this movie. Were they somehow talked into going along with this? Is Rush Corporation at a stage in their development where they need to take it to the next level, finally, or it's never ever going to happen? Everyone's getting older, of course. Were they astounded by the success of the Anvil movie and wondered why they never thought of it earlier?  Some of the aspects of this film do have the appearances of contract publishing - the band has so much brutal honesty, and they seem like guys with very little to hide, that you can't suspect that the documentarians went easy on them, but it's still a perplexing piece of work in some ways. It's amazing, really.

Finally, I'm further convinced at how important the song ""Limelight"" is to the band and its fans. It provides the lyrical reference to the DVD's title, the band is often quoting it (Neil notes the relevance of ""I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend"" at one point in the video). I am confirmed, also, in my belief that it is justified beyond just personally liking it for it to be my favorite Rush song.
The packaging is pretty good, with beautiful pics all across the outer case, a huge concert pic from the inside package, pics of the guys in their younger days, and a gorgeous full-colour 12-page booklet.",1318982400,3,17402,4.724069805729338

4128905,2,B003J27WFW,"I was a Rush fan growing up, have seen them several times in concert during the ""Permanent Waves"" and ""Moving Pictures"" era. So, my Rush credentials are in order.

By any modern standard, this can hardly be called a documentary. It's clear that the members don't like any in-depth prodding, so what we end up with is really shallow. Here's what the DVD covers:

1. Early years.
2. Critics never liked us.
3. Here's what each album was about.
4. A teeny bit of personal stuff.

And, that's it. Instead of prodding Neil Peart and the others about their Ayn Rand fixation, we hear nothing of it. Ayn Rand was a bizarre person, with even more bizarre beliefs, and hated people she thought were a drain on other successful people. So why the intense appeal of this loony to three great musicians that seem like nice guys?

Instead of asking Alex Lifeson about his brawl with police officers in 2003, we get to see the church basement they played at when they were sixteen.

We don't even get to hear how ""Gary"" became ""Geddy"".

The whole thing is really, really shallow. They don't even discuss the music in depth. Just that they tried to push themselves.

Oh, and please stop putting Jack Black in all these documentaries on rock bands. The only thing worse than his bad acting is his bad documentary input. Please put a muzzle on that clown. One star off just for having him here.",1317081600,10,1377,4.528225806451613

There are 300 other reviews here so I'll make mine to the point. Superbly produced - well thought out with good segues. The ""extras"" on the 2nd video are good too - especially the ""animated"" (P'd) up dinner between the three. Very funny - Alex really is a funny guy. The motorcyclce trip by Neal after the family tragedies is dealt with in a tasteful manner. No talk of his African bike trip, and no discussion of Alex's brush with the law in Florida or wherever that was. Overall the DVD delivers - scenes and stories that the vast majority of us wouldn't have seen before. I should add that I live in Thailand, and while rush.com or whatever the main site is called wouldn't deliver it here, Amazon semed to have no problem. Of course I had to watch it on the computer. Having said that, you should be aware that good ol Mircrosoft said if I watched this I could never switch back and watch Zone 3 videos again (Asia zone).

Touches on why these guys have been drubbed by the rock press since day one.

4128915,5,B003J27WFW,"For me this one is a no-brainer, as obvious a 5-star rating as I'm ever going to give.  A solid, fun and warmly personal documentary about my long-time favorite band is about the greatest thing I can experience on a screen.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this film takes you from the band's humble beginnings in the early 1970s through their years of heavy prog-rock, to the peak of pop success in the early 1980s, finally leaving off with the band members as the elder statesman of rock n roll that they are now.  The story is engaging, sometimes very funny and always very revealing, making this band even more likeable than they already were (if that's possible).  It's a fan's dream.  I saw it in the theater with my best friend, who is the biggest Rush fan I have ever met, and the audience consisted of a bunch of guys (very few women in attendance) aged 30 and up.  The members of San Diego band Pinback were in attendance as well, and I got a chance to chat with them briefly at the end of the show as well (they were a local favorite of mine when I lived in San Diego).

All that said, just because I am a huge Rush fan and had this sort of man-cave-ish experience with the film doesn't mean that you necessarily won't like it if you aren't: a) a huge Rush fan; or b) male and middle-aged.  The fact is, this is at its core just a great story about 3 good friends who managed to somehow defy all odds and their own expectations to become one of the world's biggest and most artistically honest rock n roll acts.  The events that took place follow them through decades of cultural change, from the 1960s to the present.  I can honestly say that even if I had not much in the way of prior knowledge about Rush there would still be enough here to hold my attention.  That is the mark of great documentary filmmaking.

So whether or not you are a Rush fan, this might just be worth your time.  If you are even mildly interested in this band, the film is something you NEED to see.",1308700800,,1990,4.274666666666667
4128916,5,B003J27WFW,"For me, the best thing about this film is that it shows three normal guys who just happen to be amazing musicians. A three-piece band that sounds better than some of the bands out there who sport six members.

 The beginning roots of the band was interesting, and also all the crap they had to deal with from critics. In the end, their music speaks much louder than any half-baked rock critic who just couldn't understand the band. Also, the 2112 period where they talked about this, and how it was a battle cry against people who wanted them to not do their own thing. They basically wanted Rush to sell out, and their answer was 2112. Excellent answer.

 But the part that's probably talked about the most is, the section dealing with Neil Peart's personal losses, and how the other two guys in the band waited for him to heal. Most bands would have been stupid enough to actually try and replace a person who many consider to be the most talented drummer in the world. But Geddy and Alex stuck by him and waited it out. The end result was Vapor Trails, and a tour that got these guys back on stage.

 Even if you are just a casual Rush listener, do yourself a favor and check this DVD out. You'll be able to say you've seen one of the best films on a huge rock band ever made.",1308441600,,1279,4.286307053941909

4128920,2,B003J27WFW,"As a long-time RUSH fan, and an avid drummer, I thought I would've enjoyed this DVD more. The film itself is okay, but they gushed about the days with the original drummer for an extremely long time, while flying though the 1980's with little detail (especially toward the end of the 80's). The film is a good jumping-off point for the RUSH beginner. However, anyone who had recorded this film off of VH-1 Classics (like myself) will be disappointed in that the television broadcast is the same running time. There is nothing new to see here.

I mainly bought the set for the second disc with the bonus features. The features aren't very interesting. The segments with the boys having dinner was amusing, however I was expecting more concert footage from the film (the stuff that was in black and white).

I do own all of RUSH's CD's, and have most of their video releases on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD.  I can't help but feel ""taken"", and should have spent my money elsewhere.

This DVD set is for the new RUSH fan only. All others who own most of their other DVDs (and the book VISIONS that was released in the 1980's) would be better off saving their money.",1305331200,7,1157,4.521531100478469

The talent that these long-time performers exude does not go to their heads and you soon realize that they have quirks and silliness that is very humanizing.

Commentary from other rock legends reinforces Rush's place among some of the greatest acts ever known.  Fans attempt to explain their undying fervor and personal interviews with the band members show that there is still a trace of humility amidst the glowing aura of super stardom.",1304380800,,787,4.708029197080292

The honesty and musicality throughout the video is amazing.  Rush is not pretentious in any way and their sense of humor has me laughing out loud.
I always knew about the vaguely (if ever) referred to original member John Rutsey.  I never knew many details that answered questions I had for many years about his role.  Don't get me wrong; I would pay the admission price to a Rush concert just to hear a Peart solo or hear Geddy wail on that bass and play the synth. or watch Lifeson work his own magic, EFFORTLESSLY!  You will just have to get the video to understand Rutsey's vital place in the band's formative years.  When you hear them play Working Man in that small school auditorium venue, it will send chills down your spine.  I LOVE Rush and always will.  They are true brothers in every sense.

4128926,5,B003J27WFW,"I woke up fairly late in life to Rush. Having played guitar in a straight ahead rock band from the mid 70s to early 90s, I didn't think Rush was worth a real listen. My wife and son were Rush fans, but I was a rock snob and somehow ignored this amazing band. Then one night I caught a piece of this documentary on TV and suddenly realized what a fool I had been. I quickly ordered the DVD and have watched it almost every night since it arrived. It certainly is the best documentary I have ever seen, music orientated or otherwise. I was struck by the genius of their creativity and the integrity they manifest in all aspects of their work and lives. Their openness and honesty is clearly demonstrated in this movie. It is so refreshing to see these three guys take their music very seriously and themselves not at all. They obviously love what they do, love each other even after all these years and are still having a damn good time. Get this DVD, you won't regret it. Warning, if you never cared much for Rush, prepare to have your mind altered.",1300924800,,1048,4.324873096446701
4128927,5,B003J27WFW,"'Fly by night' was my intro (at the ripe old age of 16) to Rush. I'm 51 years old now and these three supremely talented men have never failed to amaze me.
Rush has always chosen evolution over stagnation; Following there collective hearts instead of following trends.
They continue to entertain and grow and share with all of us there passion for the thing they do.
There was a time where Rush was known as the LAST OF THE '70' POWER TRIOS....I suppose that's true but....what band, after all these years...has displayed the kind of honesty, integrity, creativity, virtuosity, and love for there craft that Geddy, Alex, and Neil (the new guy) bring to the recording studio and most of all the stage.
My life is sort of a road map...dotted with moments punctuated with there music.
Not a bad sound track to live by...not too bad at all.
I have seen them on stage many times. Highlights of which were back in the day when they toured with ""Max Webster"" as their opening act....WOW, those were the days but, it was the ""Snakes and Arrows"" tour about three years ago when I had the best seat in the house.....I'm a stagehand (in Detroit) by trade and my show call assignment was (down stage right) Truss-spot operator; and my assigned target was Neil in the drum kit!!!!
That was a moment....That was special....to watch and be a part of the performance...for these three extraordinary human beings, who's career I have followed for so long.
Here's to 40 more years of being ""true to ones self"".
I felt it back when I was 16 years old....I know and praise it now, 38 years later as something that is all to rare in the world we live in today.
Open hearts.  Open minds.
Thank you gentlemen for a wonderful Video experience that anyone can enjoy.
and ain't life grand.
Peace.",1300492800,2,1770,4.566037735849057
4128928,5,B003J27WFW,"This will be most difficult in keeping this between 75 and 300 words as Amazon suggests, my Rush fandom far exceeds any other passion I have.  Though a newbie to Rush (Fan since 2004) I have come to love and constantly be inspired by the music they have and continue to create.  Though considering myself one of the die hard fans, this DVD was chalk full of personal interviews and recollections from Alex, Geddy, and Neil as well as friends and family over the years that provided insight into the band I thought I knew.  From inception to Living in the Limelight, Rush's story is beautifully illustrated through sound clips, photos, and video from years long gone, adding to the allure that Rush fans have so faithfully come to worship.  All the mystique and intrigue of the band are captured and fully realized; the directors do a fantastic job of instilling the fun playful nature that is reminiscent of the band members' relationship with each other.  It's especially fun to watch some of the bonus features (which the second disk is packed full of btw) in which Alex, Geddy, and Neil discuss personal hobbies and my favorite, their fashion throughout the years. :)  Packed with great bonus features and tons of extras, this is one DVD that will stay closer to your heart and reside lovingly inside your DVD player time and time again.",1300320000,,1340,4.705128205128205
4128929,5,B003J27WFW,"Beyond... is a masterful film documentary. Interesting throughout, and well-paced. Some things that were edited for the pace of the film happily appear on the 2nd disc, so they're not lost to a cutting-room floor.

Even my wife, who hates Rush, loved the film. It is deeply human, at times hilarious, and very moving. Plus there are plenty of musical clips, details behind the formation of each album, tour, and numerous individual songs.

A warning to parents - there are a few F-bombs dropped, and Gene Simmons (of the band Kiss) is interviewed, and gets rather crude at one point.

Five stars easily.",1300233600,,603,4.834951456310679
4128930,5,B003J27WFW,"I liked the showing of Rush's Beyond the Lighted Stage on VH 1 Classic but when reading their entry in Wikipedia I thought that there was something incomplete. It does not mention the role Jeff Jones played in the early inception of Rush. Most Rush fans do not know that Geddy Lee is actually the second singer/bassist and frontman of Rush. The original line-up of Rush consisted of Jeff Jones on bass and vocals, Alex Lifeson on guitar and John Rutsey on drums. Jeff Jones left the group before their second live performance and was replaced by Geddy Lee after several incarnations of the group. Jeff Jones would go on to play bass in Tom Cochran's Red Rider group and is seen in the group's video for Lunatic Fringe. He was a member of a Gospel rock band called Ocean in the 1970's and had a minor hit called Put Your Hand In a Hand. I don't know if the film's lack of mentioning Jeff in the early incarnation of Rush was because he is Black or because he was in the group shortly but I thought that was unfair to Jeff Jones and to diehard Rush fans. Anyways it was a good film but people in charge of the script should get their facts straight before putting out a film a group as big as Rush. Thats my two cents worth. I'll buy it at some point this year but I will be unsatisfied for a long time considering the exclusion of Jeff Jones' name in the film",1299801600,2,1358,4.2471042471042475
4128931,5,B003J27WFW,"After so many years of listening, watching videos and catching shows, this Rush documentary is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. It is such a treat to see what these guys are like in person and to see how hard they had worked to make it. They really have lived the Garage Band Dream- having been friends in high school and starting a band that would exceed everyone's expectations including their own. This video documents so clearly the true musicianship that each member had at such a young age, with live performances at school gymnasiums and local clubs you will see Geddy and Alex jamming with John Rutsey. And then, the ""Master"" as actor Jack Black puts it, is introduced as a new drummer is needed. It's great to see the rawness of Alex's solos where you can hear his idea that will evolve into the solo you have grown to love. This video will explain what we already knew about Rush, that they were always just about the music only. They never hid behind an image to sellout to the Big Wigs at corporate. Their art was never second to record sales. The documentary captures Neil's tough circumstances and the love that these guys have for each other that I will argue can be more important than the music in keeping a band together.  Even someone that has no knowledge of this band will appreciate its inspirational example of the human spirit at its best, to always keep the dream alive no matter how tough it gets.",1299542400,,1444,4.511450381679389

4128933,5,B003J27WFW,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video because it really dealved into the very beginnings of the band, especially with the early home movies of Alex chatting with his parents and jamming in his home.  Then there is the great amount of time that Neil gave to being interviewed for this.  Since he so rarely does interviews it was great to hear what he had to say.  I was also really impressed with all of the artists that they got to speak to regarding Rush's influence on them (who would have thought that Kirk Hammet was such a fan).  It was such a wide variety of artists it just blew my mind.  This is really a must see for any and all Rush fans.  You will thoroughly enjoy it.",1299110400,,673,4.25984251968504

The same as another young group (need I mention). A lot of great, great memories came back to me being the ""Rush Fanatic Fan"" but the young fans are not forgotten and they will cherish this as well. Produced and Directed with absolute perfection.

4128939,5,B003J27WFW,"If you're expecting to go Beyond The Lighted Stage to get a full history of Why Rush Is Here, this is a complete MUST HAVE. It takes you from the current of when it was filmed, which was on tour, I'm guessing for either the R30 or Snakes and Ladders Tour, into the beginnings of the band from when John Rutsey was there, to the arrival of Neil and the thoughts of Geddy and Alex when Neil showed, some of thoughts of where some of the albums were going musically, into the tragedy that Neil faced in the 90s. Some of the artists that appear in this also share their thoughts; the one that actually hit close to home was Billy Corgan from The Smashing Pumpkins. Honestly, be prepared to laugh, maybe shed some tears along the lines, and DON'T SHUT OFF THE CREDITS. (Believe me, you'll either thank me later or call me names for saying that, but this is coming from someone who usually shuts off the credits.) The bonus DVD is a dream line up of some things that didn't make the movie in its entirety and live tunes. This set PROVES why they earn the title of Working Men of the rock industry.
I did see this movie first on TV, but had to have it in my own collection, not to mention when watching on TV, commercial breaks were getting a little annoying.",1295136000,2,1252,4.264705882352941

Then I basically stole my brother's Exit Stage Left cassette. Then I kind of forgot about Rush for a while. That is until I picked up the Live in Rio DVD. Amazing concert!  After that I went back to buy a good portion of their albums. After watching Beyond the Lighted Stage I am officially a huge fan, and now I own all their albums. It's refreshing to see a group of guys that are so down to earth and classy despite all the success. They are so deserving and work so hard on their craft. Never losing focus. It makes me like them more!  Aside from all that this DVD is well produced and their story must be told. They are one of the greatest rock bands of all time up there with Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd!",1295049600,,844,4.072289156626506

The movie is great and makes you want to watch it over and over again. The career of the band is very interesting itself, and full of ups and downs, and this DVD/Blu Ray will show it all to you.

Certainly worth it to RUSH fans or those who are just curious about them. Word of caution: (Actually several words) You are likely to want to go to one of their future concerts if you have the chance, after seeing this documentary. May I sugggest Red Rocks Amphitheatre outside of Denver... excellent venue. After which you may be hooked... Not such a bad thing as you will find.

It's a good mix of live footage, interviews, and behind-the-scenes clips of the band's career. What I like, is the way they delve into the ideas behind their epic albums, and how they were inspired.
Geddy, Neil, & Alex are pretty funny guys, and you get to see that, as well as the great chemistry they have together.

Highly recommended, but, if you're already a Rush fan, it's no-brainer, eh?",1294617600,,491,4.579545454545454

I guess there is so much to say that even if this documentary was double the length, it would still leave you wanting more.

I bought this on Blue Ray when it first came out by mistake, since I don't own a blue ray player. I was able to watch it on my sons Playstation, but he took that back to his room. I am buying the DVD version so I can watch it whenever.",1293926400,,579,3.825
4128948,5,B003J27WFW,"""Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage"" is an interesting, entertaining 2-DVD set that offers a chronology of one of the most influential progressive rock bands ever and certainly, the most famous as a 3-piece act. The first includes the history of the band from the Lifeson/Lee high school days to present and the second, a video scrapbook of clips, some rare and some available on other Rush DVD sets.

The first DVD is a little more than an hour in length and although the material is priceless, I was a little disappointed as a longtime Rush fan that it was not longer. There is definitely enough to mention with the band's 40-plus years to cover at least 2 hours, if not more. Certain important periods of the band's history, e.g. A Farewell to Kings (after 2112) were grouped in a period representing the introduction of the use of synthesizers in the band's music. It would have been nice to have certain barely-mentioned albums given a little more commentary. Even so, this DVD is definitely worth its weight, with comments offered by various other musicians, the likes of Sebastian Bach, Gene Simmons, Jack Black, Les Claypool and others.

Through the camera lens, we see the formation of the Lifeson/Lee bond in the high school years and the early version of Rush with John Rutsey. After the first album, Rush decides that Rutsey's health is too questionable for him to endure the rigors of constant touring. Shortly after, the Neil Peart audition happens and the new version of Rush forms with Lee and Lifeson more convinced by Neil's phenomenal drumming and intellect than his outward appearance. The new Rush is born and the progressive rock world is about to change forever. Some rare footage of these early periods is offered and the video quality is excellent.

From that point, we see that the Lee/Lifeson/Peart trio endures some tough early years with pressure from the record label to conform and the band resisting, marching to ""its own beat"". These were very difficult times for Rush and nearly resulted in its own dissolving. The breakthrough was ""2112"", which to the label's surprise, gained quite a cult following. At that juncture, Rush was then able to dictate back to the label just what it would play, as well as how it would write/arrange its music.

Later scenes progress through Rush's success in every significant period: Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace Under Pressure, etc. through the desire to minimize or eliminate the use of keyboards (Test for Echo), the unimaginable tragedy of Peart and the triumphant return of Rush.

One of the most significant features throughout the DVD is Neil Peart joking and smiling in front of the camera. This is a major juxtaposition of his expressions offered while onstage and reveals the side of him that fans really want to see. Of course, the life of fame, coupled with highly intrusive fans and personal tragedy have changed him. I just watched the Grace Under Pressure DVD (1984)(Rush Replay X3) and he was a totally different guy, very relaxed in front of the camera and not uptight at all. He might be humble and private in nature, but he should accept that he is widely considered to be one of the most (if not THE MOST) accomplished drummers in the history of modern music. Not only that, but the drummer/lyricist-turned-social and environmental psychologist has authored the lyrics to some of the most phenomenally important songs in the last 30 years of rock:  The Spirit of Radio, Tom Sawyer, Subdivisions, Distant Early Warning, The Big Money, etc....

Through both of the DVDs, one can see the personal chemistry that has made Rush successful throughout their history: it happens offstage as well as on. An intimate bond of friendship between highly-talented musicians doesn't happen often and it's no wonder that Rush is so highly regarded by their fellow musicians. Their individual abilities transcend into superstardom, whose fans have long since inducted them into their own Rock 'N Roll Hall Of Fame.

This DVD set is definitely for old Rush fans, but also new ones just coming onto the scene who want to learn about the extraordinary musicianship of perhaps the greatest ""cult"" band of all time.",1293926400,,4196,4.916666666666667

4128951,5,B003J27WFW,"I can think of one and only one major flaw in this documentary: It ends too quickly.

The filmmakers unearthed stunning footage from the early '70s -- Rush playing small gigs before they were signed, Neil Peart's previous band in action, even a family argument in which Alex tells his family he's leaving school to pursue music.

The band is remarkably candid about several issues in band history. Alex and Geddy agree that they disagreed over the role of keyboards in their late-80s output. The famously reclusive Neil opens up about his reluctance to greet fans and, to my great surprise, about how he coped with the family tragedies that put the band on hiatus.

Add the interviews with fellow musicians, and we're left with a clear picture of how Rush influenced music and how they went about the business of doing it.

The film never lags. It's never repetitive. I'd agree with other reviewers that even those who don't like the band but enjoy the creative process would find the film interesting, funny in many places and sometimes touching.

Hard-core Rush fans may complain about a favorite topic left unexplored. I was surprised that the filmmakers didn't mention Geddy and Alex's solo projects. Some of the changes in producers and record labels are omitted or mentioned only in passing as the film rushes (pardon the pun) through several albums of the 90s and 2000s. They never explain all the goofy stuff on stage with the band -- dolls? Washing machines? What is all that?

But this film could've been five hours long and still left someone's pet question unanswered. What we have here is stunning in its own right, and it doesn't gloss over whole periods of band history (cough cough ... Behind the Music ... cough ... Fleetwood Mac ...). I had high expectations for this film, and it met them. Fans will not be disappointed.",1293408000,2,1839,4.767295597484277

The extras per se are another movie, so you kind of get like 2 movies in one. The PQ is not HD, because this is almost all archival material, so do not judge this movie for its PQ.
The movie tells the story of the Canadian progressive rock band RUSH, one of the best selling bands of all time (I believe they are third only after Beatles and Stones). It is told chronologically by chapters, starting when these guys were in high school, until the Snakes and Arrows tour.
This movie shows how influential Rush were (and still are), and how important is to put passion in whatever you do in life, and do whatever your heart tells you, regardless of the fashion, and without an obsession to fit in. A good lesson for the world we live today.

4128959,5,B003J27WFW,"I got this on DVD not too long after it was released, and it was worth every penny. I had been introduced to rush about a year and a half before (Some of the best music I have ever heard, and I now own every studio album except Feedback) but I knew little of their story. granted, on searches for the lyrics and meanings behind their songs on the internet, I picked up some of the story, bit it's nothing compared to what's in the documentary.

There's a little bit of everything in here, and most of it's actually rather funny, while other parts are rather heartbreaking (The Ghostrider era, for instance) but in the end, it tells the story of three genuine intelligent human beings, quite unlike any other band. Music has made great strides with rush's influence, and with out them, there would be no Dream Theater, Queensryche and other notable prog rock/metal bands.

This documentary even turned my father over to liking Rush, and this is a man who never cared for my musical tastes up to that point. He never actually intended to watch the movie all the way through, and yet 10 minutes into it, he was taking it all in and enjoying it. Afterwords, he asked me for a bunch of my Rush CDs to borrow.

So, I cannot guarantee you will like Rush after watching this (though it is quite likely), but they WILL have your respect.

From their humble beginnings to their humbleness today, they remain the same. Musically, the progression of Rush over time is mind boggling. For me, they are the most consistent musicians since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. With the 19th album in the works, I can not imagine the USA without Rush on tour delighting fans every where. This video tells their story exactly they way the boys wanted it to be told. 5/5. Perfection! No Rush fan should miss owning this gift for fans from the trio....",1288569600,,794,4.598591549295775

4128982,4,B003J27WFW,"What's interesting is that I am ABSOLUTE Rush fan, yet this film only proved to me what I have suspected about some of the guys in the band for a LONG TIME....  For starters, Geddy is pretty full of himself. One particular comment was about how ""simple"" other bands' music is. What he's trying to say here is that VERY FEW bands are on the ""virtuoso"" level of Rush's playing. That may very well have been true in the past, but when you listen to Dream Theater, well, so much for THAT opinion.

I've always seen Peart's leaving the band on his ""soul searching"" bike ride as entirely self-indulgent - and this story cemented that aspect. Sure, you want to grieve over losing your family members, but FIVE YEARS...???  Just proves how much he loved his bandmates by making them sit by for half a decade waiting for him to decide if he ""still wants to play drums"". The excuse that he ""does not handle fans well"" that was emphasized in the film, and how Alex and Geddy have to do all the palm-pressing events with fans, sounds just like an EXCUSE to me. I mean, the man is a friggin' AWESOME drummer and a hell of a lyricist, but he ain't no GOD..... And that's the way he comes off to me in this film.

As far as I'm concerned, ""Hemispheres"" was their ABSOLUTE ZENITH, musically and creatively. There were a couple decent albums after that, but after Moving Pictures, the band took some (again, self-indulgent) strange directions and let their (then) current producer toy with their sound and make the synthesizers the focal point of the music and not the guitar. HUGE mistake and one that cost them my loyalty, and many other true fans of the band as well. After you've written something like Hemispheres, why in the world would you want to go back down levels to playing drivel....??  Funny how Peart admits in the film ""After we wrote Hemispheres we decided that was the LAST time we were going to do an album LIKE THAT...""  Hmmmmm....  What does THAT MEAN, exactly?

Why would three intelligent men distance themselves so ardently from their finest work..?  One has to wonder sometimes about peoples minds. I for one was never sadder to lose the ""progressive Rush"", a band that paved new roads with excellently played, yet melodic arrangements, and odd (yet palatable) time signatures that so perfectly complimented the music.

I know I'll probably get flack for my unflattering opinion of a band so highly regarded, but I'm just calling it as I see it.

I play my ""old"" Rush over and over again and as a bass player, I believe myself to be more in tune with their music and what they stood for than the average person. I'll just have to be satisfied that - at least for a brief, shining moment - these three guys shined brighter than most of us mere mortals.

Bravo ""Hemispheres""!",1286150400,3,2781,4.54

This band went through a major transformation after their first hit single ""Working Man"" was receiving radio air time and as we all usually say, the rest is history.

4128985,5,B003J27WFW,"Okay, until about 2 years ago, I was decidedly in the camp of women who would tolerate Rush on behalf of the husband/boyfriend who has been obsessed with them since birth, but wouldn't necessarily call myself a ""fan"" of Rush. I knew one or two of their songs from high-school and even sort-of liked Tom Sawyer and Limelight, but I really had little knowledge of the band nor an appreciation of their musicianship, etc.

In 2002, my DH took me to a concert on the Snakes and Arrows tour while I was 7 months pregnant with our first child, and aside from the ""fragrant"" audience members nearby, I truly enjoyed the show and was suprised by how many of the songs I actually knew.  Mostly, though, I enjoyed the light-show and the washing machines and found myself wondering what hair-product Geddy used, and whether Alex was a natural blonde, stuff like that.  Still, Rush remained somewhere in the Top 20 of my all-time faves behind U2, The Police, Zeppelin, Dave Matthews, Van Halen, Eric Clapton, Journey, etc.  The introduction of Rock Band and Rock Band 2 in our household began to change all that however, and, as our faux-band's intermittent vocalist/bassist, the Rush songs quickly became my favorites to play while on tour with ""Needs Swabbed.""  (Don't ask!)  By far some of the most challenging and enjoyable songs for a wanna-be Rock Star to play of the entire RB setlist are Camera Eye, YYZ, and Working Man!

Fast-forward to Spring/Summer 2010, my husband and I attended a showing of Beyond the Lighted Stage at our local artsy-theatre, and, all of a sudden, I just ""got it.""  These are three guys who are true musicians, who write meaningful songs about things that matter in life as opposed to smut, who are committed to their wives and families, were never defined by drug-abuse and womanizing, who never sold-out musically, and who genuinely like each other after 40 years.  What other band can you honestly say all of that about that is still around today?

As a female, music has to have some sort of an emotional hook to it in order for there to be a lasting connection and to truly win me over.  Sort of like watching football.  If I know the story behind the team or if there is a player who has overcome great odds or has done something great in life outside the field, then I can get excited about watching a game and rooting for a particular team.  I can't just watch some random team for the pleasure of the game itself.  Sorry.  Same holds true for music.  I can appreciate certain songs for the difficulty of the playing or the beauty of the vocals or intricacy of the lyrics, but a true connection with a song or band is rare.  Either it has to have been relevant for me at a certain stage in my life so as to bring me back to a place in time, or there has to be a story behind it.  Rush has an amazing story.  I just can't help but genuinely ""like"" the guys as people first, and I am now listening to their songs with a whole different perspective and connectedness.  I truly get excited about rooting for them to keep bringing amazing music to their devoted fans and new fans alike, and can't wait for our kids to be old enough to see them in concert!

In July 2010, my husband and I attended the Rush concert in Saratoga Springs, NY, and although we were some 30 rows back, we both felt like teenagers again and had a whole new level of connection to each other because of our shared love for the band and the music.  Completely different experience this time as compared to the show we attended together in 2002, and the more I'm learning about Rush (just finished Neil Peart's Ghost Rider...a must read!), the more I'm looking forward to seeing more shows together (please keep touring guys!).  Being one of the only ""hot chicks"" (husband's term, not mine!) at the show was kinda fun too, given the 80/20 ratio of dudes to babes, and walking into the ladies room ""line-free"" was a first for sure!",1285804800,8,3927,4.49226441631505
4128986,4,B003J27WFW,"RUSH- Beyond the Lighted Stage DVD-2010

Rush. The Canadian wonder has long deserved a substantial media exploration..if for no other reason the rabid fans that have long been associated with the band will chew on any crumb of information or insight that the trio might offer...for the novice or non fan, Beyond the Lighted Stage is a worthwhile endeavor to aid in understanding just exactly what makes Rush tick beyond all reason and against all odds.
Scott McFadyen and Sam Dunn, the filmmakers behind Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and the Iron Maiden concert movie Iron Maiden: Flight 666 lend their creative eye and straightforward approach to telling Rush's story which is as much about their bond and friendship as it is about their progressive rise to success despite early criticism, difficult band personalities and a nonconformist approach to being a rock band.

The band's tightness and mutual respect for each other is shown through archival footage and coverage of them off stage--you see the unit that is RUSH and insight into each individual member, and whether fan or detractor, it is clear why Geddy, Alex and Neil work as friends and as musicians.

McFayden and Dunn also give the non Rush fan reasons...reasons why the band got together, reasons why they stayed when the mainstream press boo'd them off of the pages of the trades, reasons why they struck a chord with an unique and loyal fan base and why they continue 30+ years later. The best motivation to get this DVD?...instead of pandering and glorifying the band, McFayden and Dunn cover the icky bits as well... Lee's most unusual vocal style, Peart's notorious attitude towards their fans, early changes to the band's lineup and even a self depreciating segment on the band's self proclaimed lack of style.

Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the documentary, are the interviews with the ""other fan base"" Rush attracts...fellow musicians who site them as major influences.. Billy Corgan, Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Zakk Wylde, Sebastian Bach and Tim Commerford round out a diverse group of well respected performers who joined the Rush club early and have never left.

Whether you have a vast collection of ticket stubs in a Rush scrapbook or not- ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"", is a worthy tribute to a band and a fitting premise that love them or hate them, you are compelled to respect them.

4128987,5,B003J27WFW,"I have been a fan for years, and was pleasantly surprised by this documentary.
To see how many other rock musicians were influenced by Rush was surprising.",1285545600,,155,4.777777777777778
4128988,5,B003J27WFW,"The band Rush is the Rodney Dangerfield of music - no respect.  Despite dozens of gold albums and decades of consistently sold out concerts - Rush's extraordinary musicianship and half dozen bona-fide rock anthems are consistently ignored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and critics in general) in favor of critic's darlings The Stooges (among others).  To some Rush fans, this is an outrage and part of the Hall's conspiratorial bias against progressive rock that has kept Yes, and until last year, Genesis, out of the Hall.

But this isn't the whole story.

Rush is an odd band. Their vocalist, Geddy Lee,  sounds like ""a hamster being chased by a flamethrower."" Their lyrics, written by drummer Neil Peart, while drawing on numerous literary sources (most famously Ayn Rand) - can be some of the most tedious in rock. When it all comes together however, like it does on ""Tom Sawyer"" ""Free Will"" or ""Spirit of Radio"" and a dozen or more other songs, Rush's music is something  unique that ROCKS! I dare say a song like ""Limelight"" is downright irresistible to any fan of rock and roll. The opening riff, the drum fills, the lyrics, the spacey middle section - all epic and iconic at the same time. Is it any wonder it can be found on the game Rockband!

Thanks in part to the bands longevity, some are taking a second look at Rush and their place in rock and roll history. Recent appearances by the band in the movie ""I Love You Man"" and the TV show The Colbert Report have brought them back into a bit of, ahem, limelight.

A terrific new documentary, ""Rush - Behind the Lighted Stage,"" furthers the case for revisiting this often dismissed band as one of the great bands of rock. Filmmakers Scot McFadyn and Sam Dunn, previously of Heavy Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and Iron Maiden: Flight 666, clearly know their material and have created a most respectful, mostly chronological, documentary of the band.

Having full access to the band and their inner circle, McFadyn and Dunn provide a portrait of Rush's history from their high school struggles and early gigs, the addition of ""new guy"" Neil Peart, and their evolution as music makers from concept albums to more radio friendly tracks.  What emerges from this telling are three pretty regular Canadian guys who seem down right well adjusted and relatively nonplussed by their fame and success - this despite the constant criticism and a few personal traumas (Peart lost his daughter and wife).  They really seem to enjoy each other, the music they make, and the fans that like them. No bitterness comes through. There is little Behind the Music to unearth, and this documentary avoids that more tabloid tone.

What also emerges is their incredible precision as musicians. ""If you can play Rush, you can play anything!""

Talking heads like, Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan, and Jack Black (among others) provide witty and insightful commentary about Rush's career while showing the influence Rush has had on many of today's musicians. Clearly the respect for Rush runs deeper with musicians than the critics.

I hope some members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame view this as they may find they actually respect Rush more than they realize, and vote them in. For everyone else, it's just a great documentary to be enjoyed recalling how fresh it was to hear ""Fly by Night"" all those years ago.",1285459200,2,3364,4.767641996557659

I bought this DVD hoping it would have more rare concert footage that I'd watch over again.  Unfortunately it's mostly home-made video of them driving around their hometown visitng old haunts.  I did learn a lot about the band and their roots, I should have just rented it because it'll probably just collect dust now.",1285372800,7,432,4.571428571428571
4128990,4,B003J27WFW,"Overall the documentary was definitly worth watching and absorbing.  I have been a devoted Rush fan close to 30 years now.  At the time of writing this I must set a few things straight to the reading public.

First, I think the most fruitful periods of Rush were the Terry Brown period -  2112 - Through Signals. Terry did work on a few albums prior but I felt those particular albums were the best in terms of writing and arranging.  I think Terry was integral in their sound.  I think he latched on to the strong points of Rush and exploited it to their advantage.

Ok, with that being said Strong points of the film for me:
First, we see for the first time the early period that included John Rutsey.  I didn't realize he was the spokesperson of the band at this time.  We see some historic video of him introducing the members of the band etc.

Secondly, There is this early video of Alex Lifeson addressing his parents in a room of other people discusing his future as a musician rather than following the norm.  I am wondering where this video came from.  I think it was astounding that the producers got hold of this.  It almost had a feel it was an early documentary in which Lifeson was a part of.  Would like to know more about it, but it is a gem here to see Alex in such raw and rebelious form as a young man.

Thirdly, they touched base on the period of Rush in which keyboards took over, namely in the later 80's.  I left Rush for a period after this and it also was the same period in which Terry Brown Left  (After Signals). It just reinforced my own belief here that something changed.  I never thought that it was a positive change, because I don't think Rush has ever been as productive as they were in the Brown period.  In saying that however, they are monumental live and always have been.

I am glad they also shot some video of Neil on the road with his motorcycle.  I have read all his books.  I feel he is unbelievable as an author.  For those who think he is un-reachable to the fans, he is a completely different person in his books and very very genuine.

Now for the weak parts and for which I took off a star:
This documentary did not Need the likes of Jack Black or Gene Simmons to give any interviews here.  I thought it cheapened the production and made it more theatrical.  I didn't care about those parts.  The documentary could have stood on it's own without stars lending words to Rush.  Rush was never mainstream and hard to classify except for people like me and the devoted.  You either like Rush or not.  There is no in-between here.

Seriously, it is a fantastic film documenting one of the best bands in the world.  We all grew up listening to them, going to the concerts, watching the videos & playing the music, but did we really know where they came from besides Canada?

Well now you can know it all!  The film follows each member from early childhood to today & the challenges they faced growing up, working in the band & after they became the sensational band they are today.

Guest cameos include Gene Simmons, Tim Commerford, Billy Corgan, Taylor Hawkins & many more!

It is worth the money you shell out for this film & it will be in your collection for years to come (unless you loan it out, in which case you'll never see it again!)

Don't die wondering...........BUY THIS DVD TODAY!!  & turn your amplifiers up to 11 & ENJOY.........You'll thank me :)",1284163200,,1081,4.301980198019802

A perfect year-by-year explanation and description of the band from the beginning.  The band's overall good spirits and humor will keep you laughing well after you finish watching.  A definite worth-while experience and the extra content adds an extra hour-and-a-half to the film.

The documentary does a great job of showing the different phases of the band, from the early rockers to the heavy synth phase of the 80's, to the present day.  I have a new appreciation for the music and the band.  the interview with Gene Simmons from Kiss is priceless!  I would recommend this for those who are Rush fans, obviously, but also for non-Rush fans who may enjoy the fact that one of the most successful and long-lived bands in rock can be so humble and grounded.",1284076800,,538,4.245098039215686

4128999,5,B003J27WFW,"I've been a fan of RUSH since the 2112 album. No, I can't claim to have been there for the first album but I managed to make it to the 2112 tour and have been a fan ever since. There were some albums that I didn't care for but I always tried to attend their shows if I could since they were always great.

There is a major lesson here. In reviewing the evolution of RUSH through this documentary one comes away with a new look at success without excess. It seems counter to what we think we know about a successful rock 'n roll band and that point is abundantly clear in this film. How can these guys be so cool and yet so modest and earthbound? The answer is deceptively simple: They stayed true to themselves and they rocked their asses off. Here's a band that did what they wanted to do, when they wanted to do it and critics be damned.

It's a great film and a wonderful look at a truly awesome rock band.",1283990400,,909,4.101123595505618
4129000,5,B003J27WFW,"This documentary provides rare views into the personalities and interaction of Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, while giving the viewer a unique perspective of the making of a 70's rock and roll band and the evolution that has made RUSH! such a success and joy for fans nearly 40 years later.  I'm a dedicated RUSH! fan since first hearing ""2112"" blister my ears while working in a record store.  Every new album is much anticipated, and never dissappointing.  However, I'm not insanely fanatic - about anyone (unlike some of the fans interviewed in the film who hit multiple shows each tour).  I'd have to say the RUSH! has been my favorite band because they are always there, always intriguingly creative and fresh.  I've always had a connection with them and felt that they were MY band.  This film showed me that I'm not the only fan that feels this way.  It is definately a film for all RUSH! fans, but most importantly it is a film for all Rock and Roll fans from the 70's - this will take you back to argueably one of the most dominant eras in Rock and Roll history.  Rock on guys, eh!!!",1283644800,,1101,4.47
4129001,5,B003J27WFW,"The movie is fabulous. Nice interviews with big names from the rock scene. Neil opens his heart and Alex steals the show. It also has amazing footage from the early years, including videos (yes: videos!) from Alex's and Neil's pre-Rush youth. Non-fans may also like it, since the three guys are really funny - specially when they get together. I definitely recommend it.",1283644800,,370,4.888888888888889

4129007,5,B003J27WFW,"Tremendous DVD package.

Have been a Rush fan since 1980 (Permanent Waves), one of the few bands never to have found there way to New Zealand (or Australia) and after watching this, if I'd had the money, I'd have been on a plane to the USA to catch one of their concerts!
(The clips on Youtube look fantastic, they're playing the whole of the ""Moving Pictures"" album - wow! and the new singles ""Caravan"" and ""BU2B"" sound great!)

In summary, after watching this twice, for me this feels like the single most definitive example of the old cliche...""If you want something bad enough, work hard and believe in yourself you'll make it"". Also I think it illustrates the power of freindship, respect and compromise. These three guys most certainly come across as having this for each other, there is such a strong bond there.

It's an emotional rollercoaster and there are a number of times I thought, wow it could have all ended at that point, yet Alex, Geddy and Neil kept going.

FANTASTIC!",1282867200,2,987,4.655172413793103
4129008,5,B003J27WFW,I had to give my 2 cents on the extra's. I LOVE the live recording's with John Rutsey. It was great to see where they started from. Everyone knows that Neil is easily one of the best that has ever played but it was nice to see the beginnings. Without Rutsey they go nowhere. They would never of have had the opportunities when they needed them so I give John his props! The dinner extra was downright silly. What a bunch of goofs! I love that about them!,1282780800,,454,4.170454545454546
4129009,5,B003J27WFW,"It's about time they did something like this. It sure makes you feel at home with the group.they seem to be the most approachable musicians I've ever wanted to know. I'm a bass player,and I just want to say that Geddy Lee is my only influence. Rush will truly live on forever. My belated condolences to Neil Peart for his loss.",1282608000,,327,4.377049180327869
4129010,5,B003J27WFW,"It was great - the backstage - the personal stuff and interviews with family members.  Neil talking about his personal stuff and all......the music, the look back, the look forward.  And the dinner at the end with just the 3 of them and lots of wine and alot more laughter - absolutely hysterical!  I loved it!!",1282608000,,311,4.517857142857143
4129011,5,B003J27WFW,"If anyone was to come up to me and ask, ""What's all the stuff about Heavy Metal?"", I would hand them the DVD of ""Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"" and tell them it's all they need to get started. If anyone was to come up to me and ask, ""What's all the stuff about Rush?"", I would hand them ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"".

Scot and Sam have done it again. Well put together, representative, respectful, awesome. The band and other interviewees seemed relaxed and willing to share their stories and experiences. Neil seemed to be having a really good time. There were parts when he was like a kid, expressive and excited to be telling his story. I think it's probably because they knew that no one involved with the movie would do anything that wouldn't be approved of, taken in a negative way or out of context. It's a true ""Beneath, Between and Behind"" look at things.

This is the perfect primer for any new fans and a wonderful journey down memory lane for any short, mid or long time fan of the band. Except for the early footage in the beginning there's nothing brand new to someone who's kept up with the boys but the film did fill in the shades about situations, circumstances, speculations, what have you. At whatever period you joined the Rush ranks there's a point in the film where it starts to feel like it's our story too. That's just how much this band means to their fans.

The focus really had to be on the early years since that's when the information is the sketchiest. There was no Internet and international fan clubs and Geddy has said several times how hard it is to remember all that stuff. The later years are better documented and had more direction. Overall, their entire career was well represented.

It looked as if the crew at Banger Films learned a lot from making their previous film, 666. This is a highly professional documentary that's put together well and practically flawless. I only wish there had been more musicians interviewed. Rush is such a great influence you would have thought people were lining up wanting to contribute. And perhaps they were, as Sam has said before it's impractical to make a 6 hour movie. Maybe there's a directors cut in the future?

Some of my favorite film makers telling the story of my favorite band, I couldn't be happier. If you thought it was impossible to hold Rush to a higher standard for how they run their careers and live their lives this film will reinforce those feelings while creating a newfound level of respect. There are many reminders of why we care so much about this band.",1282521600,,2555,4.557734204793029
4129012,5,B003J27WFW,"I DVRed this off Palladia a little while ago and finally got to watch it last night. Not really sure what to say about it other than it is an amazing, amazing, amazing film that surpassed my expectations. The old footage the filmmakers have dug up on these guys is by itself enough for me to give the film my highest recommmendation. One particularly notable example is footage of guitarist Alex Lifeson at a very young age (18? 19?) debating the pros and cons of a career as a professional musician with his parents at the dinnner table. Where did they get this? More interesting, who was sitting at Lifeson's family's dinner table documenting this (in color and sound, no less), way before Rush was famous? This is but one of the many joys to be had for the Rush fan in BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE, which I will not ennumerate, but instead simply say that if you have been a fan of this band at any point in your life, you need to see this film. It's hard to predict these things with any kind of certainty, but I'm pretty sure that in time this film will be listed with the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kids-Are-Alright-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001NHZ2KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kids Are Alright (Deluxe Edition)</a>&nbsp;and LET IT BE as one of the all-time great rock documentaries.",1282521600,2,1344,5.031390134529148

4129021,5,B003J27WFW,"Watching ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" a documetary on the band RUSH is like visitng with an old and dear friend.  There are moments of nostalgia, surprise and clarity that remind the viewer just why this band and their incredible catalogue hold such a distinct place in music history.

Presented in the film are two childhood friends (Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson) who dreamed about forging a musical path and the ""new guy"" (Neal Peart) who when joining the band made that dream a reality.  The filmmakers give the fans enough fodder and provide the ""not so familiar"" with detail that love them/hate them, you walk away from the film with the knowledge that this is not only a band striving for perfection in their art, but a group of friends who share a deep love and respect for one another after being together for over 30 years!  This point is all too evident in the filmmaker's handling of the tradgedy that struck Neal Peart's life in the loss of both his daughter and wife.

As a fan of over 20 years, I was delighted in the amount of detail provided in the film with the band's origin and its member's constant strides to change, evolve, perfect, and challenge their musical sound and abilities.  Sometimes those changes lost fans, but you have to admire that in the end, it has always been about the music and what Alex, Geddy and Neal felt they needed to explore.

All in all, ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"", for me, is a wonderful visit with three friends whose music has touched my life and seen me through the ""ups"" and ""downs"" the many years I have ""known"" them.

By purchasing this film, I know that I can visit with them any time and ""that's good enough for me"".",1282348800,,1670,4.506622516556291

4129043,5,B003J27WFW,"Rush is a band that has always done their own thing --whether the masses liked them or not...whether their fans at the time liked the next thing they were about to do or not. This doc does such a great job of showing off a band that truly did it their way, did their thing great, and quietly carved out a legacy in Rock -- particularly prog rock that stands the test of time. This is a great Doc for the Rush freak fan (which a lot of us are) and for the music lover who was a casual fan at some point -- or even the wife, ex-wife, girlfriend, ex-girlfriend who never undestood why a guy could love this band so. Whether you never liked them, like every song they write or barely remember Tom Sawyer, you won't be able to help identifying with them as people, going through life in business, as friends, and as artists through decades of music together. It's a portrait of a life to strive for -- doing something you like, doing it as well as you possibly can, paying attention to your own opinion of what's cool, and doing it with people you like to be around.",1280880000,,1061,4.205882352941177

4129046,5,B003J27WFW,"First - the scene where Alex talks about dropping out was from ""Come On Children"", a documentary by Allan King from 1972. It predated reality TV - 10 troubled teens living on a farm for 10 weeks. It's actually going to be released on Criterion DVD in September as part of ""The Actuality Dramas of Allan King"".

It's a wealth of info on a band that has been together over 40 years, how two guys from high school bonded and through pure hard work and opportunity, paved their own road to success, and there were a lot of bumps along the way. They explain why the first drummer left, they also had unbelievable love and support from their parents, which is what really came through to me. Their manager Ray also talks a lot about life on the road. A lot of big names in music are on here, but it was actually Gene Simmons and Rush discussing touring together - you realize that tour in particular put them on the map.

There's more focus on the rise to success, than when they hit it big in the early 80s when ""Moving Pictures"" took them to another level. But they do discuss the loss of privacy (the part where Geddy and Alex go to a restaurant is hilarious, and Neil boasts being able to be anonymous yet be around people), and the fans.

Of course, Neil was hit with unbelievable tragedy in the late 90s, and because Neil's already written about it in ""Ghost Rider"", Alex and Geddy are left to discuss it in the film, as well as the band getting back on its feet in 2002. Their appearance on Colbert is also mentioned. I think the only part missing that should've been included was the Toronto Rocks benefit.

All in all, an excellent documentary for fans of Rush as well as any music documentary for that matter.

Interesting tidbit - the 1974 rare footage with Rutsey, was filmed in St Catherines. Neil Peart's hometown. And even though it's not mentioned here, Rolling Stone finally interviewed Rush in 2008.. of course Rush wasn't on the cover (Obama was).

Rush is a GREAT band and some of the BEST musicians in the world! I've been a fan since grade school (late 70's) and it was really interesting to watch how these guys got together from the very beginning. I never knew that Geddy and Alex were childhood friends and met in grade school. This doc takes you from the very beginning, thru all the ups and downs, all the musical changes such as implementing more keyboards in the late 80's, to the present day success they are still having after all theses years. Just went and saw them live in Chicago for the first time and going again Aug 23rd 2010! Can't wait!

They were the first band I went to see live ($6.00 back in the day) I love DVD sets with rare concert footage, and the little tidbits into the past. It's kind of like reliving my childhood as well. Normally I wouldn't buy a full on documentary, but if you are a RUSH fan like me this set is a must have. I couldn't stop watching it, twice in 2 days. This one's a keeper. There is something in this set for all fans of RUSH, even if you aren't a rabid fan like me. I highly recommend this set.",1280534400,,578,3.906779661016949

Loved seeing Alex, Getty and Neil in their ""natural"" state. Was amazed at the early footage when John Rutsey was a member of the band before being replace by Neil Pert. Had a great laugh of their ""80's"" period, enjoyed hearing a bit about their personal lives without it going overboard.
My favorite footage is on the ""extras"" when the guys are hanging out at a restaurant for a few hours consuming wonderful food and several bottles of wine ...

Would recommend for all of those who are both major and minor RUSH fans ... Myself and my husband would be in the major category considering that once the purchase was received we have watched the DVD 3 times in less than a month, and hubby couldn't resist buying tickets for upcoming concert in Aug :)while watching the show on t.v

You really get inside the band and feel like you know them and where they came from. I'm so happy I didn't see this at a theater, instead waiting for the DVD, because the bonus features are so worth it. Especially the dinner the boys have towards the end of the film. They're so relaxed and hilarious and the get on so well. You feel like you're at the table with them!!!

4129065,5,B003J27WFW,"Since the end of my high school days (start of the '80s) I have been an intense Rush fan, but never have I been able to see the inner workings, hinges, and springs of one of rock's greatest bands.  Everything is impeccably covered in great depth, from the earliest of the earliest days, all the way to today. Every phase and period is covered, and all of it by one-on-one interviews and discussions with each Alex, Geddy, and Niel. By the end of the documentary I was absolutely bowled over to feel that I had actually met them. The film producers definitely succeeded at making them intimate and accessible.

I now can see that these three are the truest of friends. They are not just far off towering icons - they're very real, and genuine men. Rock has been much more than blessed to have witnessed this phenom for more than four decades, and to get this close them is totally awesome. This may sound odd, but for years I've admired the ""Starman"" logo used by the band, but now the anonymous side of him has turned around. There is no part of Rush hidden now. Every Rush fan will cherish this film. No questions about it, it's a must have!",1280361600,,1142,4.407582938388626
4129066,5,B003J27WFW,"I got finally and its really good. I have only had a chance to watch disc one but its excellent. It covers the bands formation and early years really well and the best part is that the band are on screen a lot - loads of photos, chats with them and their families and friends. The best stuff is probably the enigmatic Neil Part who overcomes his natural shyness to speak about some deeply personal things on camera.

There are lots of star talking heads - Billy Corgan, Vinnie Paul, Kirk Hammett etc and they offer some good insight as to what motivates Rush fans. At least I recognised a lot of what they were saying especially Billy Corgan talking about learning to play all of 2112!

Its a little light on material on the bands career in the mid eighties - and there probably could have been more mention of the live records.  At the same time I suppose the film makers are trying to squeeze the best bits of a 40 year career into about 90 minutes and viewed from that angle it really is a fine film, a real achievement and a great tribute and introduction to a truly fantastic band.

For fans this is essential viewing and anyone even mildly interested should enjoy it as well.

PART 2
Last night I watched the extras Disc and I have to agree with so many of the other reviewers here - the extra footage adds up to make this one of the most compelling and intimate documentaries ever seen. After this you really do feel like you have met the band and it gives a really great idea as to what being in a working band is like or should be like. All three come across as very genuine, funny guys, remarkably dismissive of the fact that they have sold so many millions of records. Their integrity really puts the antics of some modern ""stars"" into perspective. The archive footage with John Rutsey is great and the 1979 La Villa Strangiato performance is fantastic - probably my favourite.

To close - get this - if your a fan and if you're not you might well be getting into Rush by the end of it.",1280361600,,1997,4.297872340425532

This is probably the best documentary on a band that I have seen . Some of the early footage is beyond belief that they actually took movies of early conversations with parents on careers in the band . This is beyond my highest expectations and even non-Rush fans have found this very interesting . A must have . The extras are about as long as the main documentary and just as good .,1280275200,,525,4.106796116504855

to DVD. I didn't see this on the big screen, due to the fact that is wasn't showing near my home(about 2 1/2 hrs. away by car), so I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary about my favorite band of all time, Rush.

WOW!! This is such an eye-opening view into the 40 yr. phenomenon known as RUSH. It takes us back to the very beginning of the band with some videos and pictures NEVER before seen. Even I, who's been a Rush fan since 1981, learned some things about them that I didn't know. And to hear some other monsters of rock(and Jack Black who is so funny and honest here) review what they think of them with such high praise for the music and musicianship. Which justifies what I've been saying for years...that these guys, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, are pure genius in what they've done since their inception way back in the late 60's/early 70's.

This DVD goes through all of their breakthrough albums in their vast discography of prog rock immortality. I HIGHLY recommend this documentary DVD, Rush - Beyond the Lighted Stage...even if you're not a Rush fan. You just gotta give it up to these guys. Long live RUSH!!!",1280275200,,1231,4.491071428571429

4129071,5,B003J27WFW,"I can't really say much more than the other reviewers who have contributed so much awesome detail. I think this documentary was awesome, specifically because it focuses on the lives of artists. As fans, our heads are already in the music. Although, it's a treat to see the nuggets of Rush's performance and studio footage from their beginnings to their current efforts.

The part that really drew me in was honest commentary from Geddy, Alex, and Neil about the keyboard-heavy albums (Signals - Hold Your Fire) . Often regarded the underdog in the band (not sure why?), it's obvious that the keyboard-heavy era for Rush may not have been easy for Alex, even though Geddy remembers it with fondness, and Neil...well - he was pretty diplomatic about it, saying that you have to be careful not to go to far in any direction.

One of the things that originally drew me to Rush were the keyboards. Back in '89, a high school friend introduced me to Rush by letting me borrow A Show of Hands and Presto. I was blown away by the amount of well-composed synthwork and textures, and further amazed by the fact that these guys somehow coordinated this with playing guitar, bass, and drums. I would literally sit in my room for hours listening to those albums (on cassette...), and learning the keyboard parts and trying to reproduce the sounds as I programmed my synth. Yea, I was hoping to get into a Rush cover band - I was young and naive.

When I went to college, I'd started accumulating a little Rush collection both on vinyl and cassettes. I had Moving Pictures and Signals on vinyl. My eyes were opening even more to the awesomeness of Rush. Then a friend let me borrow Hemispheres. That is an album where you lay back and listen, and you need to wear headphones to catch the details. I think I listened to it straight through 5x in one weekend.

Ok back to the documentary...it was even more fascinating to hear from Rush's management and production team. They confirmed my sentiments about the direction Rush had taken with the keyboard-heavy sound. By Roll The Bones, I really felt like a lot of their songwriting was watered down and borderlining on a smooth-jazzy slightly rock/funky sound, and the albums where sounding thinner. Gone was the fat sound of previous albums. I felt sort of vindicated when producer Rupert Hine shared those sentiments, saying Rush's recordings needed more ""balls"". Wake-up call.

I really didn't hear the restoration of the girthier sound until Vapor Trails. They said it happened on Counterparts, but I didn't hear it. I still heard Neil's cracky, thinly mixed drums. I don't know if that's a producer thing or if Neil is just adamant about having a cracky thin drum sound with loads of reverb. The drums have to slam. The drums are make-or-break when it comes to a fatter sound.

In more recent albums, Rush has nixed the keys and replaced them with more layering and background vocals. I have to admit, I am bummed about that. It's all about finding a balance. I felt like they had that balance on Signals. It was a meaty sounding album with a tasteful amount of synthwork - just enough to say, hey, we're in the 80's now.

Anyway, it's possible I could write a book about Rush's career, however Beyond The Lighted Stage is definitely the best venue for a band's biography that I've ever seen.

The really cool thing about Beyond the Lighted Stage was that it made me passionate about listening to Rush again. I'd burnt myself out listening to them. I hadn't picked up a Rush vinyl, cd, or cassette in over a decade. Now, I'm building a Rush mix for my iPod, and I am psyched. Listening to Rush really gave me a keen ear for detail in music, not to mention their music has stretched me as a musician. Knowing more about their lives makes all of that a little more personal.

Even if you're not a Rush fan, get BTLS if you're a musician and want to immerse yourself in the journey of a rock band who has been around for over 30 years, and still haven't sold out.",1280275200,,3998,4.580419580419581

I did not know about this DVD until I saw it at the store. The packaging was better than usual for a doc.' The disc covered things things I did not know about like their early years as a high school band. Seeing John Rutsy playing with them was a kick.
This probably was the most informative and entertaing DVD about the band.
For those who watch the first disc and say ""hey, they didn't talk about that etc."" Watch the bonus disc it answers most of those questions.

I like the part where they talk about Hine producing Presto- I wish he would produce another one of their albums. Nice bonus DVD in which they include some concert footage. My favorite was the song from Counterparts(one of the few songs that I actually like from that album) dedicated to Entwistle. I almost docked a star for the negative portrayal of their mid 80s albums. I loved these albums and I truly believe that Rush was one of the few bands at that time that continued being progressive. Their personalities are certainly revealed. Geddy likes baseball like me so that's cool and he seems to be a down to earth kind of guy.  Alex is funny and Neil's kind of a loner.

4129083,5,B003J27WFW,"Rush never got much respect from the press, the critics. They were, in their own words, outside of the mainstream but very nearby in their own stream."" Yet, it turns out, they were always the outsiders. Bullies loved to wait for them, to attack them, physically, emotionally. Whatever. Many of us have seen that kind of abuse. We can rise above. The guys in Rush did, and here they are with a fantastic new documentary covering their history and career. It makes me wonder what those bullies are thinking now. Do they even realize that the long haired ""hippies"" they were taunting are the same guys that are probably rocking out to? Life is interesting with its twists and turns.

I love this movie. Sure, they could have covered a lot more, and I wish a Rush show could last another three hours on top of the three they give us, but we are all human, still.  We all only have so much to give, and they have given so much. I'l take what I can get and hope for more, but I will never expect more. Life is funny. It takes expectations and runs them through the meat grinder over and over again.

Again, this film made me appreciate that aspect of life all over again.  I am glad that this movie seems to be putting the expectations of some non fans through said meat grinder. They appreciate the people behind the music which, retroactively, sends them back to the music. Maybe they hear something they never heard before. Maybe their thoughts don't change. but they give it a chance. Maybe their minds are opened to new ideas and new possibilities. Maybe not. How else is change affected if you don't try some new input to think about? If you don't like it, you don't like it.  Life still goes on, whichever way the wind blows for captains, philosophers and working men and women.

I always felt like one of those outsiders:  always a bit awkward in crowds and at parties. I still do, though I've come out of my shell a bit, and I've faced off with a bully or two, successfully.  All told though, I think I kind of  like my shell. And strangely, Rush, of all things, showed me that I can be engaged and concerned with the world around me, and still be OK with my shell and need for space and privacy.

Check it out for yourself. You might be amazed.",1279756800,2,2248,4.369304556354916

4129085,5,B003J27WFW,"After seeing RUSH open for KISS in Rockford, IL in 1974 or 75 I have been a diehard RUSH fan. This DVD is a very personal look at the band that never got the respect it truly deserved. Some very old video footage with the late John Rutsy on drums is truly awesome and the newer concert footage on the bonus DVD is high quality as well!

4129086,5,B003J27WFW,"Neil Peart is the Nerd Zen Master.  The man has an impressive list of accomplishments that doesn't include playing  skull-crushing drum fills (like the ones in Natural Science).  He has written the novels  ""Radiance Over the Rockies"" and ""The Masked Rider.""  He is an avid bicyclist and motorcyclist.  Most bravely, he dealt with the deaths of his wife and teenage daughter in less than a year's span.  I can't imagine how he dealt with something like that.  He has achieved more artistically than any other Nerd in his age group.  The Rush cult worships his every move;  every drum fill and every odd metered beat.  He can do no wrong.  I also happen to love this gentlemen... the epitome of the quiet genius.

The documentary is loaded with very rare clips and songs from the late 60's.  Many fun surprises are pulled out of the vault.  Best of all - they talk in length about the albums ""Caress of Steel"" (swank), ""Hemispheres"" (boringly swank) and ""Farewell To Kings"" (Breathtakingly Swank).  This period of output from Rush is so completely over the top that you either love it or ignore it.  Simple as that.  A song like ""Circumstances"" is either perfect or garbage.  The band was so good at crafting Prog Art in the 1970's that it left the rock critics with their hands tied.  They had no choice but to ravage them - chastising them for being conceited Canadians with poetry lyrics and no sense of rhythm or style.  To put it simply, Rolling Stone magazine hated them.  Case closed.  If you want to give Rush a try - give one of those three records a spin.  (note: 2112 is overrated)

The bonus DVD is loaded with amazing fun:  Rush Nerd conventions, an ALEX section deleted from the final cut, a short PRESTO section, and best of all - Geddy trying to explain why they had a rap section on the track ""Roll The Bones.""

  The documentary showed me so much more about the alienated spirit that inhabits the Rush mythos.  Peart understands much about being alone.  He is the shaman of the alienated nerd in us all.
If you love RUSH - check this one out.  They got it right this time and let some of those elusive secrets fly free.  It taught me one thing for certain:  Doing things your way is the only way.",1279411200,,2212,4.488664987405541
4129087,5,B003J27WFW,"Growing up in the era where MTV wasn't thought of and journalism wasn't on the internet, I grew up wondering what my favorite musicians would say, should they ever be interviewed.  Course, we had magazines but I think the lack of the journalism we have now, added to the mystic and the artist was left alone.  Still, it made me wonder.

I was a rabid fan during the mid and late 70's to the mid 80's, and then after that, I didn't follow the band too closely.  However, Rush did introduce me to a lot of 70's prog-rock and yes, I DO enjoy the changing time signatures, clever lyrics and the music that appears to be too hard to play.  Today, we want our french fries hot and we want them NOW.  This video shows that sometimes patience and hard work does pay off and I would rather listen to music that is interesting and challenging, instead of what we're calling 'music' today.  Yes, I am a musician and I learned to play from studying my instrument and grew up listening to groups such as Rush, Deep Purple, Van Halen, Rainbow and the like.  Today, I listen to a lot of instrumentals simply because I am sick of today's bands showing us how much they can complain and bitch and load their songs with nothing but profanity and stupidity.  Watching this video gave me a much deeper respect for the band and it does show us musicians who are still fighting the corporate bullocks and those who say ""you have to do THIS and sound like THEM"".  If you stick to your guns and your heart, you can overcome the obstacles and find others who feel the same way.

That's why I highly recommend this video to anyone who in need of a little tarting up.  Rush did it and is STILL doing it their way and it shows us that yes, even intelligent geeks can turn up and rock hard.

The sound is great, the filming is great and it is entertaining, as well as, informative.  I would recommend this video to any musician and/or music fan.  It is a great insight to the world known as RUSH.",1279411200,,1967,4.2926829268292686
4129088,5,B003J27WFW,"The release of this documentary got me all excited about being a Rush fan again. I had stepped back from their music from a number of years, and had not purchased any new releases since Roll The Bones, which I hated. Then I saw that a new documentary was soon to hit DVD. I began scouring youtube for details and samples, and it got me all fired up about Rush again. I pulled out the entire catalog of albums (that I owned) and reminded myself how good this band are.

For me, I'm a huge fan of Rush from 1980-1989. Permanent Waves through to Presto were all great albums, though some are obviously better than others. As far as their earlier work goes, I do own and enjoy Hemispheres. Though I've purchased A Farewell to Kings twice, one of those times being in the last month, I just cannot get into this early sound of Rush. While Geddy Lee's voice is one of the highlights of their music for me, it was far too shrill in this early incarnation, and finally started becoming less painful and more enjoyable on Permanent Waves.

With my excitement for this upcoming DVD, I decided to pursue the later Rush albums that I chose to pass on since Roll The Bones. I purchased all of the studio albums, including Roll The Bones again. They are spotty for sure. RTB still stinks, and I can only find 2 songs worth repeated listenings. Counterparts was another bland effort with only 3 songs worth listening to. Things pick up on Test For Echo, in which I enjoy nearly half of it. Vapor Trails was a grand return, containing quite a few wonderful melodies and hooks, though with the well known terrible mixing and mastering. Snakes and Arrows had very few hooks or melodies, and only managed 2 great songs. So my future interest in Rush is in limbo.

I love documentaries, especially about music. 'Beyond the Lighted Stage' certainly did not disappoint. We get to see how the band grew up basically as misfits and outcasts, and have achieved an amazing success that has left them just outside of the mainstream, but also not a struggling cult band. The friendship between Lee and Lifeson is such a rare thing, and to truly enjoy each other to the level they obviously still do is a blessing. While details of their personalities can be hinted at by watching their concert videos, this documentary really shows the dynamic between the three very different members of this band. Geddy Lee is the more serious and melodic member of the band. Alex Lifeson is, as expected, the nutrageous comic relief and hard rocker of the band. Neil Peart is the more introverted, sensitive and humble member. All of these traits come together to form a very unique and respectable musical unit.

I wanted the documentary to go on forever, but the ample bonus material gives a little relief. There is a lot of focus on the early part of the band, yet some details are not really mentioned. I'm sure it's probably easy info to find online, but I felt the doc should have covered how the band chose their name, and what, if any, relationship they retained with their original drummer, and even some words around his passing.

There seems to be two sides along the Rush camp - those who love their 80's electronic influenced output, and those who do not care for it. For me, it was the 'New Wave' influence that attracted me to Rush. The first song I enjoyed by Rush was 'Vital Signs'. My sister had the Moving Pictures LP back in the day, which is how I heard this song. Let's face it all of you hard rock Rush fans, if 'Vital Signs' was released as a single by a brand new band in 1981, it would have been labeled as New Wave. And that's what I loved about Moving Pictures and subsequent albums. For the record, this author's music collection consists of New Wave and Classic Alternative, with Rush being the most 'mainstream' artist I own. And I was so pleased to see in this documentary the band proudly admitting their influence and acceptance of New Wave influence into their music. It's what attracted and retains me all of these years later. One can assume with the limited focus on Rush's 80's output in this documentary, the filmmakers are more fans of the Hard Rock style of the early albums.

For those of you who enjoy documentaries, feel a little like a social outcast, or like only 1 song by Rush, I would highly suggest purchasing 'Beyond the Lighted Stage'. Whether or not I like a particular song or album by this band, they are arguably the most talented musicians in rock music, and experiencing this streamlined version of their story was a delight. I've had Rush on heavy rotation for the past couple of months now.",1279238400,3,4609,4.533653846153846
4129089,5,B003J27WFW,"Not one for hyperbole, and hard to please, quite frankly. I feel like I've seen it all. But Beyond the Lighted Stage truly is one of the best rock films (the best?) AND documentaries I've ever seen. I've now watched it twice and I liked it BETTER the second time!

We live in a mixed up, tortuous world. But a beautiful world too - where good people can get together to do great things. And - do it their way. What a great story. Neil Peart's Dad's comments about the day he joined Rush - man, if that doesn't get you fired up and warm your heart, nothing will.",1279152000,,561,4.146788990825688

4129091,5,B003J27WFW,"Not even sure why I'm writing this review as I notice a couple of weeks after its release, it has 70+ five star reviews!  Who's the party pooper who left a four star review?  However, seeing the film twice now and watching the extra features contained on this DVD last night, I felt the need to chime in and say that this is absolutely a perfect documentary on one of the best bands of all time.

The basics of any good rock documentary are all contained here -- the beginnings of the band, the struggle, the success, the influence on other well-respected musicians, the legacy, etc.  However, at the core of this film and the story of Rush in general is friendship.  What a rarity for a rock band with this long of a career!  Anyone who has seen or read interviews with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson or Neil Peart over the years knows that these are three individuals that truly like one another, but it really comes across quite beautifully in this film.  Whether it's the scenes of Lee & Lifeson going back to their junior high school and recalling how they took most of their classes together, or if it's the emotional segment of the film discussing Neil Peart's personal tragedies -- you just know that these three guys love one another and that comes before the band.  It almost seems like acrimony goes hand in hand with the biggest bands of all time -- The Beatles, Yes, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, the aborted Zep reunion from a few years back, and the list goes on.  For some reason tho, this has not happened with Rush.  And it may simply come down to that these are three very nice, level-headed gentlemen.  That just also happen to f**king rock.

Anyway this documentary is perfect.  The bonus features are also great, with particular highlights being Geddy Lee's frank discussion on the recording of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hemispheres/dp/B000001ESL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hemispheres</a>&nbsp;(probably my favorite Rush album, but seemingly a sore spot for the band) and footage of Lee, Lifeson, and Peart enjoying a dinner together over many bottles of wine.

4129092,5,B003J27WFW,"Nearly thirty years ago I fell in love with Rush at first listen when I was twelve and heard those powerful opening strains of ""Tom Sawyer"" (so Rush is not just a guys' band, as any viewing of ""Rush in Rio"" could have told you anyway).  That song, and the corpus of Rush's work generally, resonated with me (as clearly it has with millions of fans for decades) and seemed to open up a universe of possibility--well, perhaps it rather inspired me to explore a universe of possibility.  This documentary captures that sense of inspiration, especially with those wonderful interviews with other musicians awed and inspired by Rush.  Particularly moving and telling was Billy Corgan's recounting how, when he was sixteen, he asked his mother to listen to ""Entre Nous"" with him.  Now how many teenagers would be inspired to do something like that, to seek connection with a parent because a song spoke to his alienation?  And it was Rush who helped to make that possible--amazing!

This documentary helps to articulate something that the so-called music critics almost universally overlooked, namely, that Rush's deeply intelligent and emotionally mature lyrics that explore the wide range of human experience--paired with their superb musical craftsmanship--speak directly to the best in everyday people.  Whether you are a plumber, a philosopher, a nurse, or a parent, there is something about Rush that touches you. Sure, one's understanding of ""Bastille Day"" or ""Red Sector A"" would be augmented by an understanding of French history and World War II, respectively, but the general themes of rebellion against tyranny and injustice are widely shared beyond specific historical events.  Newer songs such as ""Ghost Rider"" and ""Secret Touch"" will reduce anyone to tears who has experienced loss.  And classics such as ""The Trees,"" ""Free Will,"" ""Spirit of Radio,"" ""Subdivisions"" .... simply brilliant and insightful without being condescending.  This is part of what makes Rush so unique and accessible--they don't try to be clever; they're genuine, sincere, and ""fearless"" (in the apt word used by one of the interviewed musicians).  So, thank you, Rush, for being who you are and for offering your fans this overarching look at your career thus far....",1279152000,3,2249,5.1680440771349865
4129093,5,B003J27WFW,"The creators of this documentary has made others where, either, they told the story of the subject; the content focused entirely on one person. (Flight 666 could have been called the ""Bruce Dickenson Show, but I digress.) In this tale, we are introduced to two high school kids, Geddy and Alex, who, in the hope of escaping from some troubling aspect of their respective youths, founded a blues/prog-rock band that would go on to iconic status equal to the biggest of rock's acts. What we are introduced to is the three members of Rush looking back on their lives and careers from the wisdom of middle-age and explaining it all to their devoted fans. The tale is funny and filled with the usual, but vividly told, road-warrior tales of a young rock band starting out and pressing for success. All the accounts of the great shows, (and the bad ones) the amazing people (a special place is reserved for KISS here) they encountered on their path to world-wide success, the battles with short-sighted record company types, the critics, and the very heart-felt moments that their careers and friendships were built on. The addition of devoted famous-fan comments from Billy Corgan, Sebastien Bach, Les Claypool, Kirk Hammett, Trent Reznor, Jack Black, and many more just add to the power of Rush's influence over so many. This is the story of a band that brought their show to the people and won them over. Rush is truly the people's band.",1279065600,,1434,4.786290322580645
4129094,4,B003J27WFW,"After a career of 35 years, the rock band Rush collaborated with filmmakers Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen on this very thorough documentary. Members Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart all sat down for very long interviews, the vaults were opened for a torrent of archival footage, and past producers and even the band's parents give their impression of the musicians.

Fans will probably find the documentary most informative in its coverage of the band's early days. The account of Alex and Geddy upsetting their families by dropping out of school and touring is enriched by actual film footage of a teenage Alex arguing with his parents. It has long been said that drummer John Rutsey left the band because his health didn't permit touring, but here it is revealed that he was essentially forced out of the band against his wishes. Neil Peart's pre-Rush struggles are not discussed, but the account of his recruitment into the band is pretty entertaining. The band's sudden decline in the mid-1970s, when it seemed like it was all over until the 2112 album saved them, is frankly covered. Finally, the band's change from ambitious progressive rock to a shorter format is surprisingly linked to the struggles in the band's family lives. As we near the present day, details become more and more sparse. Geddy could have admitted that he screwed up the recording of VAPOR TRAILS and talked about the band's search for a new, competent producer for SNAKES AND ARROWS, but he doesn't. In fact, that most recent album as I write this is not mentioned at all, represented only by Neil Peart wearing a shirt with the album's logo in footage from The Colbert Report.

The documentary also covers the band's interaction with fans. Alex and Geddy show that they don't mind signing autographs or holding meet-and-greets. Neil Peart is infamously adverse to meeting fans, and the way he spastically flails about just at the mention of this reputation suggests that it's a lot more than simple shyness. On the other hand, the documentary seems to go out of its way to portray fans as freaks you'd want to stay well away from. The band's following is mainly represented by participants of RushCon, a subculture that isn't representative of 99% of Rush fans. We get an interview with a nerdy fellow, then a rather, uh, flamboyant guy. (The Rushcon extras on the second DVD are just salt in the wound.) Some musical celebrities are brought on to show Rush has had a major influence on rock. Some, like Les Claypool and Jack Black are nice to watch, but Skid Row's Sebastian Bach and the bassist from Rage Against the Machine are repulsive slobs and just undermine Rush's reputation.

The extras in the second DVD are mainly divided into two groups. First up are episodes cut from the documentary, such as a discussion of the band's hobbies and some explanation of the rap episode on the ROLL THE BONES album. The second group consists of archival footage of full-length performances of songs, ranging from 1974 to 2002. The sound quality of these concert performances is not great, but it's fun to see the band's appearance and playing change from era to era.

In spite of its few flaws, the amount of detail here surpasses most musical documentaries I've seen and is sure to entertain those who have followed Rush's career.",1279065600,12,3310,4.81195079086116

I think this is going to seal the deal for Rush finally getting into the RARHOF.

4129100,5,B003J27WFW,"This is truly the definitive retrospective that Rush seems to have been chasing for the last ten years thru other releases in DVD or book form. This seems to have been built for someone who knows nothing about the band while covering elements that a hardcore fan may have never known. I thought I knew it all. I thought I'd seen every photo. I thought I'd viewed every clip. I've been a fan since 1984. These guys continue to pull stuff out of the mothballs that suspends my disbelief. Who knew there was film of Alex telling his family that he planned to drop out of high school?! It was so nice that they shared that classic moment. Alex keeps his feelings just below the surface and to be able to see one of the most key moments in his upbringing was truly a treasure. And Geddy may not write the lyrics but he speaks with great tact and clarity regarding Neil's personal history. On Neil- I'd love to chat him up but that possibility is addressed too. In simple terms, I can relate to the embarrassment he feels as I have a coworker who would hug me hourly if I allowed it. Neil has nothing to be embarrassed about but we don't give this much adulation to the butcher, the baker or the candlestick maker. His dignity is fed by his work and not much else. When fans emasculate themselves when trying to tell him how much they admire him, he gets uncomfortable.

Values. That's probably the biggest eye opener for me personally as a fan since 1984. I share a lot of the same values as these guys and their satisfaction comes from two things: Working on the their craft and being philomaths on learning new crafts. Professional perfectionists who want to punch the time clock, go home and read a book or watch a thought provoking movie. Girls, vices and other distractions cut into this time and they won't have that! They do emphasize the value of play, family, friends but only after they've exhausted themselves with their craft. One other favorite moment is an early outdoor interview with Geddy that I'd seen before on a another DVD. Geddy appears to be bored if not snarky with the interviewer. They cut to current day Geddy and he seems to acknowledge their burnout in the early days of playing night after night with few breaks. I also feel that all the kudos from other celebrities validates Rush in a way that reveals that their following is not so underground anymore.",1278806400,3,2380,4.5092592592592595
4129101,5,B003J27WFW,"This film is a fitting tribute to a consistently underrated band. I particularly liked the fact that the filmmakers explicitly confront and defy the band's critics. Frankly, I have yet to understand what it is that these critics know or can do: they can't think, they can't write, and they certainly don't seem to know (or care) very much about music. To expect them to make music is apparently to set the bar too high, but that hasn't prevented them from having a ""highbrow"" self-conception that permits them to use the word ""middlebrow"" about Rush as an insult.

It's sad when so-called music critics are disappointed in a rock documentary because it lacks the elements of a ""Behind the Scenes"" soap opera--a consistent theme in recent reviews of this film. Sorry to disappoint, but ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is not about drug/alcohol addiction (or recovery), orgies or groupies, serial marriages/divorces, trashed hotel rooms, criminal hijinks, backward Satanic messages, or dysfunctional relationships presided over by overpaid and incompetent therapists. (Believe it or not, prurience is not the royal road to insight.) It's a film about musicians and the music they've made, precisely the subjects our mainstream commentariat is least qualified to discuss. But as South Park's Matt Stone says in the film, the anti-Rush blather that might have seemed cool and sophisticated 20 years ago--when the bulk of Rush's fan base was in its teens--now comes across as petulant, pathetic, and pretty obviously an act. There are many purely positive elements to this film, but I was glad to see that the film retains its polemical edge, and that it goes out of its way to slap the critics' faces. Those faces have needed slapping for 30+ years, and it's about time someone did the job. Much appreciated.",1278806400,9,1799,5.057239057239057

This documentary is well put together, and despite what others have said....it does not seem rushed to me.  It tracks the band back to friendships that started before the music.  I found it very interesting and all in all a touching story about a group of good friends who have shared the struggles, highs, tragedies, success and fame while making some of the most complex progressive rock music in history.

All three seem to be just simple good guys, and that really comes through in this story.  Awesome music and a real ""suck it"" to the industry that didn't really want them to succeed.

4129104,3,B003J27WFW,"I thought it was a pretty good documentary, although a little short. After they got to the album Signals, everything was just skimmed over (or not touched on at all) after that. It's too bad they didn't release this documentary after Hold Your Fire because everything after that is pretty much crap, and as of today there are a whopping 6 studio albums after Hold your fire. Yeah, there are a few good songs here and there, like `Half the world',  `Dreamline', & `Between Sun and Moon' but not much more. I mean, don't take my word for it...just go to any live Rush concert and notice how quiet the audience gets if they play anything after Hold Your Fire. Crickets...nothing but crickets.

A few observations...

-The Caress of Steel segment was interesting because I always thought that album sucked, too. Especially compared to the albums before and after it.
-Sabastian Bach is looking mighty fat these days. WOW!
- Neil is looking old. Doubt he will be physically able to keep up his incredible drumming more than a few more years, unless they slow the tempos WAY down at the concerts.
- It was a disappointing to hear Neil say that they were DONE making albums like Hemispheres and would never go back to those types of arrangements when it is Hemispheres that is probably their very best album.

Closing thought...

I just wish they'd bring back Terry Brown as a producer. Can you imagine if the word got out that they were making another long concept song like 2112 or Hemispheres and Terry Brown was producing it! Pre-order sales would go through the roof!! And this would make up for all the crap Rush has been putting out for the last 20 years. Actually, Rush might be so far gone that not even Terry Brown could help them anymore, but I think he's their last shot.",1278806400,7,1776,4.572327044025157

If you have followed RUSH for a while, there is not much in the movie that will be new to you history wise. There is a TON of early info and video, pics, etc.etc. Nice to see the light shined on Rutsey's short involvement. The film makers almost spend too much time on the early years and skip a little too much after the Grace Under Pressure period. (In my worthless opinion anyways) Neil's tragic time is addressed with class and not dwelled on too much. It's a great story about 3 friends who just happen to be great musicians. The last chapter ""Revenge of the Nerds"" is my favorite chapter, showing that nice guys can finish first.",1278720000,,767,4.154362416107382

Watching this movie has made me realize that I was missing a lot of info about my band. This movie comes out to prove me wrong, that my band has more glory than I ever realized. Watch the movie and thank god that you are a RUSH fan. They are classy, idealistic three people that you will love more with this movie.

4129107,5,B003J27WFW,"Back in 1977 a friend of mine said that I've just got to hear this new live album by the band called Rush. At the time I was probably the biggest Rainbow fan on Earth and I was totally into their new live album called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Stage/dp/B00000IMTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Stage</a>. In my opinion there couldn't possibly be anything better than the combined talents of Ronnie James Dio, Ritchie Blackmore and Cozy Powell blastin' out A Light in the Black or Kill the King. I had heard of Rush, but I never really gave them a listen because I was told that it was bad Progressive Rock with a singer that sounded like he'd just inhaled helium.

So over to my friend's house I went after school on that day in 1977, thinking more about indulging in some of his fine Columbian versus listening to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-new-Rush-album/dp/B000001ESH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this new Rush album</a>. And it was that day that turned my Rock & Roll world upside down...and not because of the Columbian. I was absolutely captivated by what I was hearing from ""Hello would you please welcome home..Rush!"" to ""Thank you. Good night!"" And furthermore, as a drummer, I'd never heard playing like what I heard Neil Peart doing on the album. The next day I went out and bought Rush's first four studio albums, All the World's a Stage and was excited to learn that a fifth called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farewell-to-Kings/dp/B000001ESJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farewell to Kings</a>&nbsp;would be released in weeks.

Why the background story? Because I would say that most of Beyond the Lighted Stage is devoted to describing Rush's exploits during the same time period that I became a fan. I'd say 75% of the documentary covers Rush's experiences from the mid 70s through the early 80s. And to me, those are the golden years of Rush. I know that there's a world of fans that continued to be big fans of Rush's ""new material"" from the mid 80s right up until the current day, but I will always view the disks up through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moving-Pictures/dp/B000001ESP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moving Pictures</a>&nbsp;as what shaped me musically and as a musician.

Ironically, Beyond the Lighted Stage doesn't even make a mention of All the World's a Stage, but this DVD does an outstanding job of telling the story of Rush's formation, through their early days of getting signed with original drummer John Rutsey, through hiring ""The New Guy"", through making some of the absolute greatest recordings in Rock & Roll history. There's some unbelievable video in this documentary, and not just of the band playing together in their early years; I mean of candid moments behind the scenes with the band. In today's world it's not unusual to capture everything on video, but back in the 70s? What would be the chances of having video of the day that you announced to your parents that you're dropping out of high school to pursue your musical career?

The main documentary is about an hour and 30 minutes long, and then there's like another hour and 30 minutes of bonus features that includes stuff that just didn't make it into the final cut of the documentary for whatever reason, some rare performance footage and some other fun stuff like pre-gig warm-up routines. By the end of watching all 3 hours of the DVD, I felt like I really knew these guys. Since that day that I heard All the World's a Stage in 1977, Rush has always been close to the heart, but now they're even Closer to the Heart.

There is no question here...if you are a Rush fan add this to your cart. And if you don't own one of Rush's current live DVD's, pick one of those up too, because after watching Beyond the Lighted Stage you'll still be craving more. The perfect cap to Beyond the Lighted Stage for me was popping in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rush-in-Rio/dp/B000IOM0QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rush in Rio</a>.",1278547200,4,4166,5.403076923076923
4129108,4,B003J27WFW,"I'll admit that i'm a Rush fan up to the Moving Pictures album only.  After that forget it, and i've really tried to like their newer stuff (Vapor Trails, Snakes) but sorry it just doesn't cut it for me.  Fortunately this movie has a lot of clips from the early years when they just smoked.  I have fond memories of seeing them live in 1976 and 77 and the clips bring back the intensity of those gigs.  You knew something was going wrong when they started wearing skinny ties on the Moving Pictures tour.  The later clips of them during their ""synth-pop"" phase are hysterical, Geddy's hairdo, the corny videos, etc.  It was unbelievable that this was the same band that did 2112!!
It never really was the same after that, try as they might to go back to a power trio format.  Guess they were just getting too old to rock(they should hang out with Lemmy more often...or Angus).  They seem like nice guys, though.

In any event it's a good watch, they really avoid making ""fun"" of them or interviewing fans of the older material asking them what they thought of the direction change.  And I must reiterate that the stretch of work from the debut to Moving Pictures is absolutely essential listening and perhaps some of the greatest progressive rock ever recorded.  But anyone watching this movie already has those anyway.",1278547200,3,1319,4.594017094017094
4129109,5,B003J27WFW,Not the biggest Rush fan in the world but this was an awesome dvd.  Could not believe all the old footage.  You cannot go wrong with this one.,1278547200,,142,4.035714285714286
4129110,5,B003J27WFW,"I've been a Rush fan since I first heard 'All The World's A Stage' Rush's first live album in 1976. Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.

Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.

I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.

I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to ""rush"" by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.

The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.

I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately. If you love Rush(and I know you do!) this is a must own set",1278460800,,2905,4.293795620437956
4129111,5,B003J27WFW,"I received my Blu-ray copy of this film while I was entertaining house guests. Being the selfish sort that I am, I insisted on watching it and not waiting days until my guests left. The female of the pair had barely heard of Rush, and was certainly not a fan. She even joked that it is ""a guy's band"". She watched the entire film, and said that she really enjoyed it!

I can't add much that has not already been said in other reviews, but this is a film for fans of musicians, entertainers, and underdogs in general. Obviously it's all about Rush, but the story at the core is that three very talented musicians were able to achieve great success while maintaining their integrity (not just an illusion here) and creative freedom.

The most enjoyable portions of the documentary for me are the exchanges between the band members, often very candid. It is clear that these men are close friends and care very much for one another - even beyond their bond within the band. I truly believe that they put their friendship above the success of the band.

The Blu-ray and DVD contain about 1 1/2 hours of extra footage, some of which is priceless. My personal favorite are the scenes filmed while Geddy, Alex, and Neil have a casual dinner together in a hunting lodge. It is the single most ""fly on the wall"" portion of all the footage.",1278374400,,1330,4.487603305785124

To this day you can still see the respect that each band has for each other.

I've always wondered back then through A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, etc. who these guys really were and from 'Canada'? I use to sit night after night listening to their albums throughout middle school and high school. I did lose some interest in the 'keyboard' years as I believe others had, but in 1989 while in Grad school I picked up Presto and it was like meeting old friends again. This movie showed me things I never knew about these guys. I thought it was great to see their parents in the movie. It really brings home the fact these 3 guys are really just regular guys who wanted to play music. I was the same way many years ago, but never pursued it, but at least I could live it through Geddy, Alex and Neil.

4129116,5,B003J27WFW,"Humble beginnings, strong friendships, and a work ethic beyond ""dedicated"" turned Rush into the true ""Rock Supergroup"". Straddling the line between ""progressive"" and ""rock"", they've taken us on a journey over 30 years in the making, and show no signs of slowing down.

I won't rehash what has been written here, but---you simply have to see this documentary if you're a fan of ANY kind of music. Young, old, musician, non-musican, aspiring musician---all will be awed and impressed by both the humility and the skill of these three men and their no-compromise approach and willingness to let down their guards (at least Ged and Lexrst, anyways---the Professor, well, will always be ""guarded"", and that'll never change). Following them through their lives with input from their parents and seeing how they developed is inspiring.

4129118,5,B003J27WFW,"RUSH has always been a perfectionist, tight-knit, passionate rock band that never skimps on musical or product quality. Whether you're talking about the choice of various excellent producers to convey their art throughout the many changes in their career, or the articulate well written detailed concert program guides over the years, or amount of program content and interviews in their live DVD's, the band has most always succeeded in satisfying their loyal fan base. 'Beyond The Lighted Stage' is no exception. I won't go into detail about exact content (as many reviewers before me have), but suffice it to say that there is enough content here to keep longtime (i'm 49 and first saw them on the 'Farewell To Kings' tour in the 70's!) and new fans riveted and happy. There is a lot of new archival backstage and concert footage, and even interviews with Geddy's and Alex's moms! Their comraderie, brotherhood, and humor is also evident when they get together at a hunting lodge for dinner, and the cameras are there. Neil also talks about why he is seemingly not as receptive to meeting fans like the more outgoing Alex and Geddy are. His thoughts are understandable, logical, and sensible, all things considered. These are just a few snippets of this great 'rockumentary'. A 'must purchase' for your music collection! THANK YOU RUSH!",1278201600,,1339,4.982142857142857
4129119,5,B003J27WFW,"I read about this and was excited. I first heard Rush back when Grace Under Pressure came out. I remember the ""Distant Early Warning"" video. You know those MTV days, when Madonna was sexy, George Michaels was the man, and Prince was, well, Prince) As I got older Hemisphere, Moving Pictures, 2112, Exit Stage Left appeared in my cd collection. I'm a huge fan of documentaries, so there was no hesitation in buying this. I could not believe how much archive footage they had from their childhood. This really sucks you in and you are rooting for them the whole time. I can already see the producer's setting up the interview with Billy Corgan. I'll bet in 5 years they will rerelease this with a bonus Billy Corgan interview DVD. He always has an opinion! The bonus DVD rocked. Even if your a mediocre fan, you will really enjoy this. Geddy Lee is beyond amazing. Those bass riffs are insane, AND HE'S SINGING, AND PLAYING KEYBOARDS WITH HIS FEET!!!! They were not your typical band either. You never hear the clich excess stories of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll with these guys. I thought it was cool to see Trent Reznor speak highly of them as well. Never saw that coming. Les Claypool gave awesome props. You just got to see this to really enjoy it. I paid a few extra bucks more and got a cool XL 1981 Moving Pictures Tour T-shirt.

 I GUARANTEE you people, this is fun to watch the first time then COLLECTS DUST! Had they included FULL Versions of the Songs, it would be fun to re-watch anytime! The ""Beatles Anthology"" to me is a masterpiece, they didn't give a crap if it was 8 hours, why doesn't this film do the same thing!
You want to watch a movie of Rush gabbing about their songs, ok then , this is great, you want to see a song play out and see the videos of Tom Sawyer and Early Distant Warning, or a live shot of YYZ, then this ISNT'T For you!
To the producers of this film: Go back and put the songs in full length, add a few more songs and videos in, then come back with a 4 hour movie and I'll rave all over it and give it 5 stars and say it's the best ever!

Ok....next subject.
I did like the interviews, many things tho either time has changed them or the truth was never told.
Examples...1) Geddy Lee said in earlier interviews that John Rutsy left on his own, this movie says they made him quit for health reasons and he took it hard....which is right?
2) Terry Brown who produced all Rush up to Signals, the original story years back was HE wanted to quit and Rush took the news so bad they almost quit but found a new producer. This movie states that Rush basically fired Terry and wanted new blood in the productions.  who knows which story is right.

PS---To all you boneheads you rip me apart for giving this 3 stars, Oh excuse me! 3 out of 5 isn't bad, it's a B- score. I am MORE A RUSH FAN THAN YOU ARE because I want MORE, I want the whole songs...for that you run me down....LOL!",1278028800,5,1794,4.114285714285714

Something about Rush has always touched me to my soul.  They don't care what people think of them.  They are simply three average Joes devoted to their craft who make magical music!  Not everyone understands them or their fans attraction to them and that is fine with their fans and the band members.  I will be a Rush fan to my dying day!

A well made film, that I think anyone (even non rush fans) could appreciate. To paraphrase Trent Reznor, it seems like they have taken a righteous path. They just seem like genuinely nice and funny guys who did what they loved. They never fell into the usual musical trappings for those exact same reasons.

This film gives you great insight into a band whose history has been ignored or under-documented for the most part. You get a great peek at the band themselves, their albums and the devotion of their fans. I hope that this exposure helps them get some of the respect they deserve, if not I am sure all the Rush fans will go on loving and supporting them for as long as they make music.",1278028800,2,853,4.265432098765432
4129127,5,B003J27WFW,"Upon hearing that my favorite band Rush was going to be the subject of a documentary I feared that the project would be some shoddy job thrown together by overzealous fans.  I am happy to report that I couldn't have been more wrong.  ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is a treat for non-fans of the band and a must own for the fans.

Part of the appeal of this documentary is the praises the band receives from the likes of Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Kirk Hammet, Billy Corgin, and many others.  Producers such as Terry Brown, Peter Collins, and Rupert Hine also provide insight into many of the band's recordings.  It would have nice to including an interview with Peter Henderson on the nightmare session that became ""Grace Under Pressure"".

The real stars of the documentary of course are the band members themselves:  Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and the elusive Neil Peart.  The band shares many stories throughout the year as a band, none of the boring.  One of the best moments is a young Alex Lifeson caught on film telling his family he is dropping out of school to become a full time musician much to his parents horror.  Alex's face displays that of total defiance.

If there is anything this documentary lacks it's pretense.  The band is honest, almost brutally at some points.  They don't come across as guys who are using music as a way to change the world or to promote some cause.  They come across as a trio of musicians who write music they enjoy and hope others enjoy it also.  Also, even though Geddy and Alex are willing to meet fans from time to time Neil Peart is honest in stating he would rather not do this.  After watching some of the fans in the interviews I can't say I blame him.

The supplementary material on this release is really nice.  I am sure fans will enjoy some of the rare live footage of the band including a 1978 performance of ""La Villa Strangiato"".  But the biggest thrill here is the camera captures Geddy, Alex, and having dinner, just being three ordinary guys, cutting up, having fun, and discussing future Rush projects.",1278028800,3,2060,4.564032697547684

That being said, I've been a fan for almost 30 years & there was tons of stuff I learned, plus just finally getting to see the guys hanging out and messing with each other was great. I loved the film of the EARLY concerts & who would've imagined there'd be video of Alex telling his parents he wanted to quit school to be a rock star?

They missed so much it was like you spent 70% of the film in the 1970s and you sneezed through the their biggest decade the 1980s and they decided to use their bias and show negative opinions about it.

That is junk journalism and junk film making. Sure, you can present the argument that not everybody was on-board with the 80s and 90s Rush, but other than Corgan and Reznor...how about the hundreds of other artists out there who loved the 80s Rush? So many people should have been included in this documentary and they should have made a version for TV and one for the theater/dvd because 106 minutes on a band that is 40 years old is a joke.

Again, this is a good stepping stone DVD if you want to get into the story of why Rush became Rush. But you are missing out on HOW Rush became RUSH.

No mention of awards, order of canada, readers polls, charity work, harvard lampoon, artist of the decade in Canada, hall of fame in canada, the debate on them not being in the rock and roll hall of fame here in the U.S., no mention of their solo albums, no in-depth look into all of Neil's solos.

First of all, there are NO 'boring' histories in rock and roll--trios that stay together for a long time, like themselves, ZZ Top, and (until recently) Grand Funk Railroad, seem to have this 'inferiority' complex about themselves, like they're only ""standing on the shoulders of giants"". Well, let me tell you, even if they never even get a ""peep"" inside the hallowed halls of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, it was the city of Cleveland itself, as you'll find out, who put them on the map, and they are 'giants' in the eyes of many rock fans, and as you'll see on this DVD--many rock musicians themselves.

But my take on their story: I found it particularly interesting the fact that Alex and Geddy were both the sons of European immigrants in Canada. Why their parents decided to settle there instead of the US, where there are more communities of Jews and Slavs like themselves is a mystery to me, but I can only imagine this reference point had a bonding effect between the two of them. It also probably gave them this ""us against the world"" mentality that would be put to good use in their music later. Geddy's Jewish mother, in particular, reminds me a lot of Gene Simmons' Jewish mother--she has that ""Zsa Zsa Gabor""-vibe about her, perhaps that's one way Gene relates well to Geddy.
With drummer John Rutsey on board, the three of them got started, probably aspiring to be like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but closer to the Blue Cheer/Grand Funk Railroad/James Gang, riff-heavy, boogie-oreiented hard rock mold, at least that's the way a lot of their early songs on this DVD sound like--by the way, I love the sound of just the snipets of those rare early songs, and I would dearly love to know if they would ever be made avaiable anywhere other than this DVD. Like a lot of other North American bands in the early-70s getting started on their way to fame (Heart, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Aerosmith, Kansas) they had a hard time finding places to play, not just because they were underage, but also like those other groups, they would only play their own original material and refused to play ""top 40"". Mostly, they were limited to high school gyms, so you see this funny photo of Rush playing in a gym with big amplifiers, a double drum-kit, and (laugh!) a basketball goal in between them! Heavy rock in a high school looked like it had its difficulties! There were some interesting peculiarites, I suppose, relating to Canadian society here--poor John Rutsey, the drummer, had to ""coach"" the crowd on how to put their hands together to clap along to the music, and the kids respond in a very robotic way (lends to the stereotype that Canadians have no rhythm!) Speaking of which, I would really love to know where they got the video footage of them playing in a school auditorium in the early days--even more, where they got footage of Alex as a teenager telling his parents that he didn't want to college. It seems really odd (but cool at the same time) that they had this, because it's not a re-creation of what happened, and on the other hand, it can't be from a home movie because it has sound? So how and why was this filmed, I wonder? Obviously, it was before they had a recording contract and got popular?

But the most interesting story for me is what happened to their original drummer John Rutsey. I always wondered why he only lasted that first album. Well, in the first of many pararlells, like Bob Burns from Lynyrd Skynyrd, he was only in the band from the get-go for convenience--he was a neighbour who happened to have a drum kit! Like Burns, he was out of the band when they got serious and he couldn't handle the fame. However, unlike Burns from Skynyrd, just from the footage shown here, he seemed to be actively involved in Rush--even the band's spokesperson on occasion! And just like Lynyrd Skynyrd--almost at the very same time in their history (late-74/early-75), who found a more serious professional drummer in Artimus Pyle, Rush found theirs' at the same time in Neal Peart. Funny thing is, they went from having John Rutsey, who actually 'looked' more like a rock star, to the ""nerdy"" Neal Peart, who at the time looked to be sporting a bad ""David Bowie mullet"". But apparantely, all was forgiven once they heard him drum! Ironically enough, it was a nerdy looking female DJ at WMMS in Cleveland who they owe all their American success to, playing their record and bringing them to the attention of Mercury records in Chicago, who quickly signed them, probably adding to their ""nerd-lore"". They are forever in her debt, I'm sure! So the first album is released, followed up quickly by ""Fly By Night"" in 1975, and then just like all record companies in the 70s, when it comes around to the third album and their have been no hit singles--they start to get restless! Enter yet another pararllel, that of Kansas, who at the very same time had come out with their debut, and then ""Song For America"" in 1975, when their label, CBS, came calling for hits. Defiantly, Kansas put out an even-less commercial record in late-'75 called ""Masque"", and at the very same time in late-'75, Rush came out with their less-commerical record in ""Caress of Steel"". Seems late-'75 was a time for progressive bands to say to their record companies ""Up yours, we'll do what we want, or die trying!"" The difference here was that the very next year, Kansas came out with ""Leftoverture"" and finally had their hit (""Carry on Wayward Son"", which was purely by accident, of course. The record was already finished when they decided to have an ""end-of-record jam. Then they made the last minute decision to put it on, and the rest is history) and Rush still had to wait a few years.
Interestingly enough, ""the Rush story"" could have ended there. In 1976, ""2112"" was the album that was to be their ""swan song""--a masterpiece it was, but the starving artists and ""martyrs to the cause"" they were, they were actually willing to go back to the farm or other low-paying jobs if this didn't work out and Mercury decided to drop them! Think of all that wasted talent they put forth on this album, arguably their best record acording to many fans,and they would actually be willing to demote themselves and give up music altogether if they were let go by their label. If indeed the Rush story ended there, only five years and three albums after they got started, we probably wouldn't be talking about this DVD--at best, they would have ended up in a ""where are they now?"" segment. Fortunately for Rush, they found another road to fame--album sales, and ""2112"" became their first gold record, influencing a whole new generation of rock fans and musicians, many of whom came out of the woodwork to sing its' praises on this DVD. Hard to believe, the record that they were going to put out and go back to the farm on, was the one that became their most influential! But it was through ""album sales"", and not having to have ""hit singles"", that kept them going. They kept their contract with Mercury and the fans response to ""2112"" kept them wanting to put more elaborate progressive rock for years to come!
But it was those early years in particular that interested me the most. The rise to stardom is always a ""heart warming story"". One particular minor detail that struck me most about the band's early sound, at least up until the 80s, was Alex Lifeson's guitar of choice being one of those old-style Gibson hollow-body guitars, which footage shows him playing on many of their most famous early songs. Not the most likely guitar you find a rock guitarist in the 70s playing, but it seems he could get a REALLY good sound out of it! No footage, however, of ""Working Man"", but if that's the same guitar he played on that tune, that's the guitar I want to buy!
The nicest thing about this video biography is the surprising (or not so surprising!) number, and variety, of musicians talking glowingly of Rush, everyone from ""Death Cab for Cutie"" to ""Metallica"", giving legitmacy to their body of work, as all great tributes should be. Again, this is a band who owes everything to a Cleveland radio station willing to take a chance on their first album, even if a certain museum in Cleveland never takes a chance on inducting them!",1277942400,,8630,4.599610642439974
4129132,5,B003J27WFW,"If you are like me you've been inspired by the music of these geniuses for decades, but never really got that intimate look behind the scenes to see what makes these guys tick, you must have this.  This film does a great job of taking you through some great chronological moments in the band's career and each member's life.  It is great to see interviews with the parents of the men and a hilarious bit of footage with a teenage Alex Lifeson arguing with his parents on the merits of staying in high school vs. going out to play in a rock band.  The stepping through each of the albums was a good method for the movie and to hear these guys talk about how difficult their music is to really play (we who have tried know this), but they freely admit it themselves and admit to challenging their musical/instrumental abilities (and Ged's voice) to newer and greater heights was very enlightening.  Now I have to go see them at least three times on this current tour!",1277942400,,965,4.435028248587571
4129133,5,B003J27WFW,"If you are a Rush fan, this is essential viewing.  I don't mean it's fun and you should take a look.  I don't mean, hey, if you ever get a chance to see it and you've got free time, check it out.  I mean:  drop everything you're doing and see this RIGHT NOW!

If you're not a fan, I still believe this would be an entertaining movie that you'd find to be a very interesting look at a band that somehow has stayed around and kept its fans happy for nearly 40 years.  But unless you're married to a fan (like me wife, who watched and liked this), there isn't a hugely compelling reason to watch.

But I'll say again, if you're a fan, this film is like a gift from on high.  A well-crafted tribute to the band.  No effort to be impartial...it is a love letter to Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart.  Many musicians, including Les Claypool, Kirk Hammet, Trent Reznor, Jack Black and Billy Corgin jump in with their thoughts on the band...but mostly it is a chronological look at the long career of this group...from birth to their 2008 Snakes & Arrows tour.  And our guides through most of it are the 3 members of the band...which is great, because the members of Rush, particularly drummer Neil Peart, are very private people and don't really grant a great many interviews.

Their story is interesting, but hardly earth-shattering.  What is so great is the sense that you're getting to know these 3 musicians on a personal level...for the first time.  We see them interact together and there is no doubt as to their deep friendship.  Particularly worthwhile is seeing the bond between Alex Lifeson & Geddy Lee.  Friends since age 12, it's a delight to see how much they clearly still care for each other and can still make each other laugh.  They are like an old, happily-married couple.  (And before you jump to conclusions, we also see that they are both caring family men with very non-rock star-like values.)
The film also doesn't shy away from introducing us to the more elusive Neil Peart.  Notoriously shy and publicity adverse, the film allows the band to discuss the impression that Peart is a jerk.  It also gives us the deepest glimpse I've yet seen into the dark time in Peart's life, when he lost his teenage daughter in a car accident and his wife a few months later to cancer.  It's hard not to be moved by the tentative disclosures we get of the clearly deep emotions these three men felt.

But the film is also hilarious, because these guys are not shy in joking about the absolutely ridiculous clothes they wore and the fact that they never had groupies.  They have been so successful in their lives that they clearly have no problem poking fun at themselves.  They aren't exactly humble, but they ARE humble about things that are of little consequence.  And they sure are serious about the music.  We get a sense of their struggles to avoid caving in to the demands of their record labels.  And we see how their musical journey never ends.

The DVD has MANY bonus features that are also a treat.  BEYOND THE LIGHTED STAGE is an unabashed love-letter to Rush...but you know what, they've earned one.  I've probably listened to ""Spirit of the Radio"" 2000 times and it still doesn't fail to make me feel better when I'm driving in my car.  So it was great to see this film that made me realize that these guys really are pretty cool...even as they are tragically unhip.",1277942400,,3384,4.498360655737705
4129134,5,B003J27WFW,"This was so well done. I am an admitted fan of the band but I think even a casual fan of their classic rock ""hits"" would be fully engaged watching this. Everything is put together with such judicious  tastes. The interviews are in depth without bogging the viewer down in one particular storyline or era. The concert footage is fun and not over produced. And what a great idea to gather ""celebrity"" opinions about the band from all different eras of rock and roll. I especially appreciated the Billy Corgan segments as Smashing Pumpkins were a fairly influential band for me a few years back. Since I have ""grown up"" time constraints now and stopped reading the music magazines and following the fan pages I honestly did not know ANY of this stuff about the band. Their early years, opinions, life experiences etc. So it was fascinating. The only negative I could come up with is not so much a criticism but more of a nature of the beast type complaint... And that is that some of the albums and eras kind of get a quick nod and glance with little in depth exploration. For instance there is little said about the Roll The Bones or Presto era...But really we are talking about a two hour documentary and covering, what, 24 albums? So decisions must be made. I would imagine most hard core Rush fans would love the movie to further explore their personal favorite era or album but I think they would agree with me that when you look at the movie as a whole...The whole narrative and experience is flawless. For instance, I can't imagine if the directors omitted ANY of the excellent and touching ""Ghost Rider"" segment about Neil's troubles for say a further look at Power Windows or Farewell to Kings? In summary, The directors really follow the spirit of Rush itself. They create something that is excellent, smart, has a lot of heart and a splash of humor to keep it on an even keel. Technically the bluray gave my 50'plasma and 5.1 surround system the workout it craved. The video and audio quality was perfect!

On a personal note, I grew up with their music as the soundtrack for my childhood and teenage years. I found this to be a wonderful experience and made me fall in love all over again with their music. But more than just wax nostalgic it really helped me see how amazingly contemporary their music still sounds and how well it holds up.

Great work!",1277942400,,2363,4.542253521126761
4129135,5,B003J27WFW,"I can't begin to express how much I love this film. Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen have done it yet again...but upped the bar VERY high that I think it would prove difficult to match or surpass this masterpiece. I have been a big fan of their films thus far (Global Metal being my personal fave). This film puts a face and persona with a very enigmatic band. Sure..We (the fans) have been to the shows, watched the DVDs, listened intently to each release, but never could put a finger on who these three master craftsmen really are. At the shows, you see a glimpse with some irreverent humor and get the impression that they enjoy what they do..but never really know just how strong their ties are.

Rush are an anomaly..pure and simple. They truly are an exception to the rule that is not only the music business, but celebrity and showbiz as a whole. They are the penultimate ""grass roots/cult"" band. They are dismissed entirely by those not ""in the know"" and revered with an almost deity-like devotion by those of us who are paying attention and listening. WE know why they are successful and love the fact that the nay sayers just don't get it. No matter how many records they sell or how many stadiums they fill...each one of us true fans still feel that they are still our own ""big little secret"". We love it that way.

The film does a splendid job of giving an up close and personal look at three very distinct personalities. Alex and Geddy, being friends since junior high, are two fairly different fellows, yet their bond is so obviously tight that you would think them separated at birth. Neil, on the other hand, seems like a very different matter. While he seems at ease with the other two and they obviously share a bond as well..he comes across as a very solitary man. I admire the fact that he seems uncomfortable being admired by fans..yet loves the idea of having a conversation with a complete stranger at a gas station on his motorcycle travels. It really does make sense that he would have to keep low key among ""fans"" because he embraces his ability to travel so far and so often, yet remain unrecognized by most people he encounters. That's not necessarily a BAD thing, he's just clearly ""different"" from Alex and Geddy. I think one of the reasons some of us connect with this band, is that we can relate to these guys on some level. Some of us like to be open and outgoing, if not completely silly..yet at times we enjoy nothing more than silence and deep thought. There's a dichotomy within this trio that seems to really spark the ""chemistry"" that they clearly have in spades!!

If I had one minor complaint..I really think this could have been much LONGER. This should have been their ""Anthology"". I think more detail could have been spent on the 80's, which was their pinnacle in terms of success. ""Grace Under Pressure"" alone could have taken up a fair amount of time in examining it's controversy among their die-hard fans. While we, the fans, love the fact that this film was ever MADE...ultimately, it is the fans that will appreciate and love this because the admiration is there before it even begins.

Neil's personal tragedies circa 1997-1998 are well handled and crafted with complete respect and reverence. We know the story..but now have a bit more insight and to see Neil actually speak about the healing process was a joy. It really made me want to get a bike!!!

All in all...I can't really overstate how much this film meant to me as a fan of 30 years. It is certainly well deserving of all the ""bravado"" it receives.",1277942400,,3555,4.5484375

I'd seen some of the pictures and video they had in the documentary before but they did a stellar job in cleaning them up  for HD.  The presentation was fluid.  The direction was great.  I didn't see the usual ""guy with a mic"" and ""guy walking past the camera"".  It was truly masterful direction.  It was just a great documentary!

If you like Rush at all (and maybe still have that copy of Moving Pictures somewhere in your collection), you must see this.

If you're a true fan, you must own this!

The archival concert footage, and the interviews with Geddy, Alex, and Neil (and their parents!) are my favorite sections. One of the best music documentaries I've seen in a long time, one that will be well worth repeat viewings.",1277942400,,725,4.511450381679389

It's underrated because they don't follow the mainstream garbage that gets pumped into our ears daily and is considered to be rock.  Rush has stood strong over the decades with keeping their style poetic and the music extremely tight for a 3 man band.  The only thing I am glad Rush did change was the length of their songs (see some of their earlier stuff for examples).  Anyway, watched this on Palladia the other night and it was just incredible.

Many music stars make an appearance in the film to share their feelings towards Rush and explain how the band was an influence on them including Sabastian Bach, Gene Simmons, Les Claypool, Zakk Wylde, Jack Black, and much more. The special features are my personal favorite...the dinner in the wooden shack is probably the funniest thing you will ever see.

4129142,5,B003J27WFW,"Sure they've had some hit songs that still get radio play to this day, but Rush has always been a band that just hangs on the outer reaches of fame and popularity. Critics never got them, as you'll see here, and they are still left out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After watching this documentary, the reason is quite simple. They play what they want and could care less about what anyone thinks. As a listener, you either get it or you don't. The musicianship is incredible of course, especially knowing that all that depth and skill is coming from only three guys. I've seen them twice in concert (2002 and 2007) and own two of their live DVDs, so I would consider myself a middle level fan.

Rush: Beyond the Lighted stage goes into the band's history from the very beginning all the way up to present day. There is some neat old footage of the guys playing at high schools in the late 60's and very early 70's, as well as, an interesting argument with guitarist, Alex Lifeson, around the age of 16, telling his parents he's quitting school to pursue his music career. I don't know who would be filming a conversation like this, especially back them, when everything that happened in your life wasn't posted on the web. It also explores the death of Neil Peart's wife and daughter, which led to his disappearance that went on for years as he traveled the world on his own.

Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson are very likeable and provide most of the humor, but I was also interested in the quiet and often camera shy Neil Peart. Other than being one of the greatest rock drummers ever, he seems like a smart fellow, but also vastly different than the other two guys. They are the ones who interact with the fans at the meet and greets, while Neil Peart's social awkwardness keeps him behind closed doors.

There are also several other artists that talk about the influence of Rush on them, ranging from Kirk Hammett and Billy Corgan, all the way to Jack Black.

If you are a fan of Rush on any level this is a must see. Even if you're not, this is a well crafted rock documentary that is anything but boring.",1277769600,3,2110,4.402564102564103

""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" is one of the better career-spanning documentaries I've seen. I like Rush, but kind of lost touch with them after 1987's ""Hold Your Fire."" This film makes me want to go back and hear what I've missed.

For all the hipsters who have dismissed Rush over the years, it's awesome to see Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Kirk Hammet (Metallica), Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) and Tim Commeford (Rage Against The Machine) singing the band's praises.

""R:BTLS"" gives even a casual viewer a dynamite glimpse into the life of this band that's been together since '68 and putting out albums since '74. In many ways, this film would make a great double feature with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anvil-The-Story-of-Anvil/dp/B002DLB1IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anvil: The Story of Anvil</a>. Both bands that have been doing it their way for decades. Rush made it, Anvil didn't.

""R:BTLS"" doesn't shy away from subjects like the tragic auto accident that took Neal Peart's daughter, or the subsequent death of his wife. As other reviewers have noted, that section of the movie is the emotional core of the whole film. Dunn and McFadyen are fans, but they're not afraid to ask why has Rush been marginalized and critically attacked over the years. They also spend time exploring Peart's aversion to meeting devoted fans.

I was really drawn into this film. No mean feat, considering this is not a story brimming with acrimony, drugs, groupies and all the other usual ""watching a train wreck"" staples of, say, ""Behind The Music."" A band, the people around them, folks they've influenced, and their fans. And that's all that's needed for a compelling story.

4129148,5,B003J27WFW,"The documentary movie, ""Rush:Beyond The Lighted Stage"" is a gift that keeps on giving. (sorry for the cliche). This movie is really a gift from the Rock group ""Rush"" to all its fans-from the past, present and future. The band that has been around for more than 40 years and has more than its shares of ups and downs in the world of rock and roll and in their own personal lives.

The reason that the movie is a gift from Rush is because they did not have to allow the filmmakers into their private lives to make a documentary about the rock band's history and their unconventional rise to fame and glory. But they did it for their fans. It's for all those middle-age men with greying hair who are located around the world. But they did allow it to be made. That's the most important thing. Rush fans have been peg by critics as white, middle-aged men in their 40's and 50's with greying hair who hold down steady jobs probably with families. I would even dare to say that some of these fans are grandfathers. And believe it or not there are women Rush fans out there too.

I can attest to this because my son and I made our way down to Nashville, Tenn., for the first showing of the movie at The Belcourt Theater near Vanderbilt University on Tuesday night at 7 p.m. June 15th. Naturally, we got lost in Nashville and turned around but finally we found our way to the theater. When we arrived there was a long line that outside the building and it curve around the corner onto another street. I thought, ""Oh crap, we'll never get a seat."" However, when we got inside, there was plenty of seating. There were some other men with their sons and maybe even their grandsons too. We found the perfects seats while my son went to the concessions stand to grab us a couple of cold drinks. While we were waiting in line outside, I observed the typical Rush fan and what he looked like. Like I said, most of us were white and looked about my age 48 years-old with greying hair and wearing glasses. Some of us had big bellies or smaller bellies (If you're lucky). I saw very few Rush fans with long hair these days. Most of us were dressed in casual clothes. I would say most of us had jobs or careers and probably had some sort of higher education. (I just assuming now from my journalistic observations). Also, a Rush fan walked toward the back of the line where we were standing and offered a free ticket to another Rush fan. I would say most Rush fans are kind and polite towards one of another and have a generous free spirit of giving like Rush musicians themselves, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart. After the movie, I observe the Rush fan who received the free ticket thank the other Rush fan who gave him the ticket in the men's restroom. Now, isn't that in the giving spirit of Rush shining through here.

Too me, I was just totally enthralled and entertained throughout the movie. It starts from the beginning days of Rush in Toronto, Canada, where the trio....Geddy Lee, Bass, Alex Lifeson, Lead Guitar and Neil Peart, Drums, all grew up. Geddy and Alex were raised in the suburbs of Toronto and Neil grew up on a farm outside of Toronto. The film shows footage of Alex and Geddy while they were in high school and Alex quit high school to play music. I'm not sure about Geddy quiting school. I didn't catch that if he did. The movie also shows interviews with all three band member's parents which I thought was very touching. Geddy parents were Jewish prisoner death camp survivors from World War II and Alex parents where Yugoslavian immigrants. Neal parents owned a parts store where he worked as a teenager. The original drummer John Rutsey had to be replaced because of health reasons and that's when they brought Neil into the picture.

Probably, the one thing that intrigued me the most about the film was how Rush decided to be just themselves and independent of everyone else on the rock scene at the time during the early and later years of the 1970's. They produced these abstract, conceptual albums like ""Caress Of Steel,"" ""2112"" and ""Hemispheres"" against all the odds of their record label but they were able to survive and remain themselves. They didn't change. I think that's the one thing that appealed to me when I first heard the band in the Fall of 1976 when my friend Donald Dillingham brought the ""2112"" album over to my dad's lake house in North Mississippi, was the band's really cool and freaky sound. When he put it on and we were just blow away by it. I had never heard anything like it before in my young life. Rush's music appealled to the psychics of our little minds. At the time, we were feeling like outcasts living in our own little worlds by our own choosing. Rush took us took us to a different world like the other rock groups did, but in a different way than Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. It was a mental escapism with the combination of their music and some of mind altering substance which I quit using years ago. I won't say which one. I'm sure a lot of middle-age men had the same experiences with Rush as I have had when they were first introduced to the band.

And movie goes on to show concert footage when they toured with bands like Kiss and Thin Lizzy just to name a few. The movie shows how Rush evolved to eventually to become the main headliner band on the scene at the time. And then they hit the big time with the album, ""Movie Pictures"" in 1981 where had such mega hits as ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" which was being played on rock stations all over the world, over and over again. This was the heyday of Rush when they filling concert halls and arena all over the world. But they still do filled these halls and arenas to this day! As a side note, I saw Rush in concert four times. It was the one band that I saw more times in concert than anyone else.

Probably, the saddest part of the movie, is when it explains the tragedy that about Neil's daughter getting killed in a car accident and then shortly loosing his wife due to an illness. Neil is a painfully private person and you could tell it was hard for him to be interviewed for the movie. I thought he was pretty uncomfortable with the interview. That's just my opinion. I may be wrong. But regardless, he did manage to do the interview because he did it for us Rush fans. Thank you Neil! The movie goes on to show some stuff on how the group regrouped after being away from it for four years because of Neil's tragedies and how he managed to cope with it by riding a BMW motorcycle 55,000 miles all over North America. He even wrote a song and book about his experiences of that road trip called, ""Ghost Rider,"" which is on the ""Vapor Trails"" album.

Regardless, if your a big Rush fan or not, this documentary movie will have you cheering, laughing, crying and cheering again. It is a must see for all Rush fans! Like I said, it's the gift that keeps on giving....from one Rush fan to another.",1276905600,27,6930,4.388326848249028
4129149,5,B003J27WFW,"Not the biggest RUSH fan, never really was, but went to see this in a local theater tonight and man, what a great piece of work! A unique Rockumentary that has many different dimensions of the band in full view. From the early years through the present, it takes you through their career from album to album in a loose, chronological way. Shows some of the highs and lows and a peak into the creative energy that the band still seems to have. Neil Peart explains his writing style and ideology a bit. There are several concert footage scenes, but if you are going expecting to see a lot of music, you may be disappointed.... for a minute.

More than anything, this is a film about real guys who had a desire and need to do what they are doing. Its a movie that touches you. The friendship and brotherly compassion that these guys have for one another is well defined. And though Neil Peart had horrific losses and tragedies in his life some years back, it seems the band has truly come full circle now and are closer than ever. I found the scenes of Peart traveling and speaking of how he and the band handled that period in his life to be a very candid and inspiring. Something positive can come from negatives.

Their is a real sense of respect you get to see a few men in their 60's, after doing the same thing for 45 years, still want to tweak their craft and reach to new levels musically. Most bands of their genre live on recycling the past, but that clearly is not the case. It is also good to see such a strong fan base grow with them. That is magical. And they have that. Not just by looking at concert ticket sales for the last 30 years, but by seeing how many people were at the theater tonight only solidified my opinion.

So that is what makes this whole film work. Not really just the music element, but the human element. Even if you aren't the biggest fan, you will enjoy the flow, the bands story and Alex Lifeson's witty sense of humor! Its a very well done documentary that has no boring moments. There are many cut away's to other musicians and entertainers speaking about the band that are funny and honest. Aside from Jack Black being in several scenes, Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)is featured many times as is Gene Simmons, speaking of taking the band on their first major tour. Sebastian Bach is there as well. But it does not diminish the quality of the film. Only makes you appreciate the range of people they have influenced.

Overall I will say A+! Great film. See it in a theater if you can, because it just looks great on the big screen and sounds EXCELLENT! Now I too have finally come to appreciate this excellent and classy band. Well done.",1276732800,13,2678,4.382293762575452

4129151,5,B003J27WFW,"I had the pleasure of seeing this at The Screening Room and this documentary blew me away!  The film covers everything you could possibly want to know about the band, their family members, their personal thoughts, influences, etc.  You name it, it's covered.  Even Neil Peart participated just as much as Geddy and Alex.  The film even covers the band's clothing styles!  The various interviews begin with explanations of their upbringing, family history, how they all came to know each other, etc.  There's also a plethora of extra knowledge, footage, images and more that I guarantee will take you by surprise... things that even the greatest die-hard Rush fans have never been exposed to.  This isn't your typical dull documentary.  There's a great deal of humor spread throughout and many moments that literally make you laugh out loud.  As if all this isn't enough, there are many moments where various musicians and celebrities share their thoughts on so many different aspects of Geddy, Alex, Neil and Rush in general.  This is a top-notch documentary.  Be sure to buy it as soon as possible!",1276646400,,1099,4.950819672131147
4129152,5,B003J27WFW,"Just saw it at the Little Theater in Rochester last night. The film is very good, just wish I could have found out more about the band members' personal lives, but they're very private. The film is a good introduction to the band but also a lot of fun for people like me who think they know all there is to know about the band. I found out a lot about how the band started that was new to me, and they had some very good quality footage of things like a teenaged Alex arguing with his parents over his decision to drop out of school and pursue music. I have no idea how this footage could exist unless there had been some kind of documentary made at that time dealing with an unknown Alex Lifeson's conflict with his parents over the direction of his life.",1276646400,,756,4.184931506849315
4129153,5,B003J27WFW,"Saw ""Beyond"" last night at a one-night special showing in a Minneapolis theater, and it is without a doubt one of the most interesting and entertaining films I've seen this year, and beyond.  And yes, yes, I'm a Rush fan...but I'm not a RABID Rush fan.  I'm missing a few of their albums and while I have a ticket to see them in concert this fall, that will be the first time.  I say this only by way of stating for the NON-Rush fan: Don't let that deter you from seeing this great documentary.  There is so little actual music in it, that anyone, even those just interested in human interest stories and biopics, will find plenty to love here.  There is close friendship, tragedy, very comical moments, inspiration...the whole package.  And how great is it to see ""rock stars"" who are intelligent and generally lacking an over-inflated sense of ego?  I think my favorite moment in the film might have come when the trio was aboard a plane, heading, if I remember right, to their next concert, and they all three pulled out books and began to read.  I didn't see what everyone was reading, but Alex was half through Christopher Hitchens'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-Is-Not-Great-How-Religion-Poisons-Everything/dp/0446697966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything</a>.  I have a hard time picturing just about any other rock stars doing something like that--with the possible exception of Bad Religion's Greg Graffin.

One funny thing from the film showing of ""Beyond.""  I arrived fairly early, and then three other guys sat down to my left, and then a few minutes later another guy was about to sit in the single seat remaining to my right, and I asked him, ""Couldn't get your girlfriend to come either, huh?""  And he said, ""No, my wife wouldn't come.""  And the guys to my left said, ""Yeah, ours either.""  So there we were, a row of middle-aged, none-too-thin white dudes, enjoying the hell out of this movie.  It had a good tribal sort of feeling to it, bonding with like-minded strangers like this.  So when you pop this into your DVD player, maybe have some buds around to enjoy it with you.",1276214400,181,2184,4.975206611570248
4129154,5,B003J27WFW,"Saw it in theatrical release on June 10.  Stellar documentary!  Great oral history of the band, lots of old footage (including gig footage with John Rutsey), almost an album-by-album step through their career, etc.  The three band members speak candidly and openly about their formative years and climb to success --- what worked (and why) and what didn't (and why).  Other musicians chime in with stories of how they were introduced to and influenced by Rush's music.  Some of the biggest laughs of the film, and there are many, come from these stories.

The DVD and Blu-ray releases will feature additional material not found in the theatrical release, so buying it is a no-brainer.

I've seen plenty of band documentaries before, but this one is special because you learn a lot  about the personal dynamics between the band members and you really come to care about them.  Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson have been mates since high school and their long-standing friendship bond is at the heart of this film.

I can't wait to see this again.",1276128000,6,1039,4.8192090395480225
4129155,5,B003J27WFW,Can't believe I just watch the best documentary about Rush in a theater with 300 other Rush fanatics. This is so well put together with absolutely priceless photos and footage. The rarities in this thing are too many to count let alone explain. I have followed the band since 2112 opening for Aerosmith and Ted Nugent in Iowa. All the history of those years came rushing back. The haircuts and clothes of Rush evolved through the 70's and 80's as well as the music. Such care and thought are put into this. Billy Corgan is so well spoken about his thoughts about Rush-I was speechless. This is a MUST SEE for Rush fans for sure. Get it NOW!!!,1276128000,5,642,4.4491525423728815
4129156,5,B003J27WFW,"I've seen an advance DVD of Disc 1, the main film, and it is very, very good. Rush's humor, which often escaped (and still does, remarkably) critics shines through on this set. The way the filmmakers and Alex, Geddy and Neil themselves explain things is fascinating. Now we know why Neil really never does meet-and-greets, even with equally famous people. The early footage of John Rutsey (RIP) on drums was rewarding too, from a historical pespective. What is more shocking, though, is how clean the ""Exit Stage Left"" concert footage looks on this release, compared to the DVD version released by Rush a few years back. The live 1981 clips on here look like they were shot yesterday, except for the slightly hazy, gauzy camera lens effect so often employed to movies and TV back in the early 1980s, and, of course, the fashion styles. Maybe we'll get a cleaned-up version of the ""Exit Stage Left"" movie with extra footage someday.
Back to ""Beyond the Lighted Stage"" - even hard-core Rush fans who think they know everything about Canada's most famous trio will be captivated by this documentary. I certainly learned a lot from watching, and I've been a fan since 1983. It's almost amazing to see film footage of Rush as teenagers - the clip of a young Lifeson defying his parents' wishes to pursue school is a time capsule deluxe. :)
Picture and sound are clear and look great on the first disc. (Still waiting for the second (bonus features) DVD advance.) Rush fans will only be disappointed in the fact that we all wish this was a 3-hour documentary film, but 1 hour and 48 minutes is a lot better than nothing. Enjoy, and play it loud. Long live Rush ....

P.S. The celebrity interviews included throughout the movie are like the ones included in The Who's equally great ""Amazing Journey"" documentary film - the talking head clips are short, to the point and never detract from Rush's greatness. Even Les Claypool, definitely a stellar bassist but a man who was cold and uncharacteristically boring during our interview last year, seems to come alive with some passion when discussing Rush. :)",1276128000,38,2097,4.760989010989011
