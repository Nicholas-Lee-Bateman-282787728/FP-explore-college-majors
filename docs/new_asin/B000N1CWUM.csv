8278270,4,B000N1CWUM,"SACRED HEART (Cuore sacro) is another beautifully crafted worked by the gifted Turkish writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek. As with all of his films there are various levels of meanings that unfold as the story advances. He gives great care to his casting, his choice of music, and his cinematography and this cohesive approach to every aspect of his films is one of the reasons they work so well.

Italian workaholic businesswoman Irene (Barbora Bobulova) and her aunt Eleanora (Lisa Gastoni) who inherit a significant Italian real estate empire. Despite the rather ruthless capitalism they display (Irene is working to convert her family's historic Roman palazzo into a crass condominium) the secret /sacred heart emerges as two of Irene's friends commit suicide and Irene encounters a homeless waif named Beni (Camille Dugay Comencini).  Her world disintegrating, she finds solace in the advice of one Father Carras (Massimo Poggio) who helps her transform her vacuous life into one of caring and meaning.  As she is told, `Your mother always used to say that each of us has two hearts but one of them eclipses the other. If each of us could spot, even for a brief moment, the light of his hidden heart, then we will understand that that one is a sacred heart. And we couldn't give up the warmth of its light.'

For those who follow the work of Ferzan Ozpetek this film will be particularly meaningful. There is always more to his films than meets the eye or the moment of encounter: he leaves us with an indelible message.  Grady Harp, June 12",1339977600,2,1542,4.847908745247148

Sometimes I feel that we have lost track in this country, of what makes a memorable movie experience -- experiencing a story that forces us to go outside of ourselves; to think about who our friends and families truly are; to get to know people who are realistic and human.  Thanx.....",1269043200,6,469,4.441860465116279
