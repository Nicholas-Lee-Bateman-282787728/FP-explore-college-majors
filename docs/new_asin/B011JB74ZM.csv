It tells the story of two lovers, separated in childhood, who meet again when grown.  He is now an architect and she the wife of a Duke.  The Duke commissions the architect to build new stables for his estate and the two childhood sweethearts realize the hopelessness of their love.  Although innocent of any wrong doing, the jealous Duke confronts them and is accidentally killed.  The architect is sent to prison for life, but in their dreams the lovers find they can meet and build a fantasy life together.  Neither age nor even death can break the bond they have created.  Starring Gary Cooper and the ethereal Ann Harding, this sensitive and sentimental romance is one of my all-time favorite films.  (Also available on the ""Gary Cooper Collection"" a 2-disc set of some of his great films.)",1438819200,,884,4.84
