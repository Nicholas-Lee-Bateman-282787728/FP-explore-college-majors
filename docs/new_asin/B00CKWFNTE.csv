8659971,4,B00CKWFNTE,"Very Good DVD but it could have had a section for (not so smart people) with stop and start basic settings where the user can look at the camera turn the dial to a specific section set it then look at the DVD again (start again) to the next setting and so on. The DVD was informative and very helpful but very busy for someone to set the camera and watch at the DVD at the same time. I have to run this DVD about 5 times before I could fully intake all the features available and make some changes to the camera that would suite my preferred camera shots.
