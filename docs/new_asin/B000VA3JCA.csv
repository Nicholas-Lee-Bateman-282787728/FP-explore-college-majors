8217632,4,B000VA3JCA,"Ruddy Hell is an excellent British comedy series, though it may not be everyone's cup of tea.

When I replaced my old DVD player I went for a multi-region player (the Sony BDP-S3100 E, with which I'm very happy) in order to expand my viewing choices. I was frustrated that a lot of my favorite British shows which showed on PBS or A&E once, have long been available as Region 2 DVDs but seem to only rarely get translated to Region 1. Others, that I'd never seen, tend not to get translated to Region 1. Ruddy Hell was such a DVD.

I learned to love Paul Whitehouse, the star of the Fast Show (which played in the U S under the title 'Brilliant'). I still believe that's Whitehouse's best work, but I wanted to see what else he had done. Like the Fast Show (Brilliant), Ruddy Hell is a 6 half-hour series of sketch comedies, this time with the very talented Harry Enfield. But what might bother most American audiences is that, also like Brilliant, each show in the series takes half, or even 2/3rds, of the jokes from the previous episode and works it from only a slightly different angle. I can imagine that some people would find their first episode devastatingly funny, and then move on to disappointment that Whitehouse and Enfield seem to repeat their first episode for the rest of the season. Likewise, it would suffer tremendously if you watched the whole disk in one sitting, as that would exacerbate the impression of repetition.

If you can tolerate that, then I find the variations sufficiently different to recommend Ruddy Hell especially to those who enjoyed the Fast Show (Brilliant), or as a less-expensive try-out of Paul Whitehouse's comedy before committing to the marginally superior of the Fast Show (Season one of Ruddy Hell sells for between $9-16 as I write this while the Fast Show Ultimate Collection represents a larger commitment at around $40).

Like the Fast Show, Ruddy Hell is spot-on and we swipe quotes from it around the house. But, at the risk of loading this review with caveats that might sound less enthusiastic than I feel, I'm obliged to point out that this is a Region 2 DVD, there is no Region 1 translation. If you have a multi-zone or region 2 player, then this (and the Fast Show) are one of the best reasons to have such a player, but if you can only play Region-1 DVDs it will frustrate you.",1404086400,,2339,4.575178997613365
