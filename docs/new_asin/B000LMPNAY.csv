8162366,3,B000LMPNAY,"The movie is largely a first person narration by a man who calls himself ""Puck."" He is part of a lame group of people who call themselves ""anarchists."" They have no rules except, no smoking, no violence, no hurting animals etc. They are lead by an old hippy named Johnny Red. They do protests in hope to generate awareness and media coverage. Puck speaks mostly in clichs, bumper sticker slogans, and quotes lines at random from cult films.

Then one day enters Johnny Black. Johnny Black uses the popular ""Anarchist Cookbook"" to generate bombs, drugs etc. in order to bring down the man. He also uses cyberspace attacks. Johnny Black takes over the group.

Meanwhile Puck gets involved with a young Christian Republican woman who is everything he is not, but ironically seem to have the same core values. Puck struggles between saving the planet from governments and corporations vs rescuing his friends and pursuing love and normalcy.",1343779200,2,936,4.917721518987341
8162367,1,B000LMPNAY,"I've previously written a bad review about DVDStore because I ordered the film Anarchists Cookbook on April 3rd. Almost a month later I still had not received the film, yet i was [....] short in my bank account. I was really counting on receiving the movie for a research paper for school. I wrote a pretty bad review speaking of the unreliability of the DVDStore. Soon after my review an associate of the DVDstore and promised me reimbursement for the film and two free movies to make up for the mistake and all I had to do is take down my bad review. Well, I took down my review and this representative of DVDStore stopped e-mailing me and it's been a week and I have yet to be reimbursed and he is no longer replying to my e-mails. To avoid further complications like this I will probably not go through DVDStore and I will not take down my review until I am given back the money I've wasted.",1241395200,4,895,4.333333333333333

8162369,1,B000LMPNAY,"Do not purchase this DVD, unless you like to be stuck watching the same previews over and over and over again.  The studio apparently blocked the ability to fast-forward past the previews.  Don't pay them money to make you watch commercials.  If you must watch it, borrow it from a friend or rent it (cheaply)",1207353600,4,309,4.581818181818182
