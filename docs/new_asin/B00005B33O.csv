Watching these fighting scenes is like watching a movies that have excited kung fu action from beginning to end.  I recommend to anyone who likes kung fu.",1106092800,,331,4.672413793103448
7936499,3,B00005B33O,"THIS MOVIE IS BASICALLY SCENES FROM CHAN'S LATE 70S MOVIES. IT'S OK, BUT MAN, I WISH IT WERE DUBBED.  TO PUT IT STRAIGHT, THIS FILM HAS NO STORY, JUST A COMMENTATOR TELLING JACKIE'S LIFE OVER A BUNCH OF SCENES FROM HIS MOVIES. GREAT FIGHTING SCENES FROM SOME GOOD MOVIES, BUT, THIS MOVIE COULD'VE BEEN A LOT BETTER. YOU REALLY HAVE TO ADMIT ONE THING, AFTER A WHILE, THE CANTONESE SPEAKING DOES BECOME AGGRAVATING TO LISTEN TO. AND ON SOME TVS, THE SUBTITLES MIGHT NOT BE SEEN TOO GOOD. WHILE IT DOES FAIL TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT JACKIE CHAN'S LIFE, IT DOES CONTAIN SOME OF HIS GREATEST FIGHTS FROM HIS EARLIER MOVIES. FOR REAL, INSTEAD OF CALLING THIS ''THE INVINCIBLE FIGHTER; THE JACKIE CHAN STORY'', IT SHOULD'VE SIMPLY BEEN CALLED ''JACKIE CHAN'S GREATEST FIGHTS''. AN OK MOVIE IF YOU CAN BARE ALL THE CANTONESE THAT YOU HEAR THROUGHOUT THIS FILM. BUT REALLY, PLEASE RELEASE AN ENGLISH-DUBBED VERSION! IN CANTONESE WITH ENGLISH AND CHINESE SUBTITLES.",1059436800,,953,4.810975609756097
7936500,5,B00005B33O,"I recomend this video to all the Jackie chan fans who likes to watch his traditional kung fu. This video is packed with action (and only action) from all the old jackie chan movies. It has all the major fighting and training sequences from movies like Snake and crane arts of shaolin, Fearless heyna, Shaolin woodden men, spiritual kung fu, Dragon lord, etc.. Very good Kung fu forms. A must have jackie chan collection!!!",1023408000,,422,4.716216216216216
7936501,1,B00005B33O,"This DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen. You can tell now that not only new movies are available but also old once are burned to DVD.
And beleve me this is an old one. I would discribe the quality of the DVD as a homevide super 8 movie take 30 years ago.
The movie is spoken in Chinese, at least I think, and subtitles are in chinese and English.
It seems it only works on 19:6 format since the subtitles were cut of on both sides of my 4:3 TV set.
The story if there is any tells the way chacky chan came to be a master.
Dont know to much about it. Looked the whole movie went to the kitchen opend the trash bin and disposed of it.
So if any one gets the DVD its at your own risk.",1018483200,,687,3.7448275862068967
