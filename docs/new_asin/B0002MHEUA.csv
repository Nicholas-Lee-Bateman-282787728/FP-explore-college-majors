2105095,2,B0002MHEUA,"BORING....PREDICITABLE...that is what I would call this movie! I really thought that I was going to be laughing the whole time...guess what...just a few chuckles..that is it...I really tried to give this one a chance, and watched over an hour of it...and I just could not bring myself to watch anymore! Chemistry between the stars was obsolete!

I would not recommend this movie to anyone! Sorry!!",1121558400,,397,5.015151515151516
2105096,4,B0002MHEUA,This is an entertaining movie.  The actors/actresses did a good job in portraying their character.  It has a plot to the story and I enjoyed it.  I laughed and I cried.  I would suggest this to be a movie to buy and keep in your DVD library.  I don't remember this one being publicized for the movies.  I would have spent my money at the movies to see it.,1121040000,5,355,4.072463768115942
2105097,1,B0002MHEUA,"What happens when two sisters join together to fight for victory in a hair styling championship? The result is ""Hair Show"" a poorly made movie that tries to be funny, tries to tell a comprehensive story, and tries to make its lead characters compelling but falls flat at every turn.

The direction of this movie is weak, and most every moment is predictable. After watching a few minutes, you can accurately predict what will happen at the end of the movie. It is one- hundred percent Hollywood formula from the beginning to the finish line. There is nothing unique or original in this film.

This movie stars Monique Imes- Jackson and Kellita Smith in the two lead roles and these two lasses are good enough to make some parts of the movie nearly bearable. They don't have very good chemistry between them and you already know how the story will end before it even gets started, but they at least offer some ""C"" grade performances.

The supporting cast of this movie is weak and most of them could have been replaced or eliminated completely from the movie without doing any damage. No one stands out in the supporting cast, and the director did a poor job in her selection. Add to that the stereotyping and the bad attempts at humor and you have an overall bad movie- one that should be avoided entirely if you have any respect for American made motion pictures.",1116979200,3,1364,4.604938271604938
2105098,3,B0002MHEUA,"I rented this movie last night to get a good laugh.  I can honestly say that I got a few.  It is about family relationships and how we all need to get over past grievances with them, no matter how many times they screw over us.  Mo'Nique wasn't at her funniest but then again, this movie is rated PG-13.  As for the things that go on at a salon, people, these things really DO happen.  If this movie came out in the 70's, it would have been called a blaxploitation flick.  The movie has several meanings...but, did any of us hear about it going to theatres?  It had its funny parts..rent it.  I wouldn't suggest adding it to your DVD collection though.",1116892800,8,652,4.286885245901639
2105099,4,B0002MHEUA,"Okay....some moments in the beginning contained a bit of over- the-top acting, which tends to happen in many of our Black movies (yes, I am Black, too, don't get it twisted!).  At first, I remember thinking, ""Uh...yeah"".  But then, the movie surprised me.  The movie is funny, exciting, and keeps you guessing what is to happen next.  MONIQUE is just good. DA BOMB.  I love her, anyway!  She is too funny, and this movie showed different sides of her (emotionally), which we usually don't get to see, but you know is in her to do! One thing this movie DID do was to give us a NICE perspective on showing different types of Blacks (successful, ghetto fabulous and more). The women were beautiful, the men were CUTIES (Owww!!!), and Joe Torry's Asian wife was TOO COOL!!!  To top it off, the songs from the soundtrack were BANGIN'.  Why are they NOT being sold and featured? All in all, see this movie to support, get your laugh on and be entertained. You GO, Leslie!

2105101,3,B0002MHEUA,"Angela (Kellita Smith) and Peaches (Mo'nique) have that typical sister love/hate relationship.  Peaches feel as though Angela has been given all the breaks in life.

As they sit through the reading of their grandmother's will Angela is given a lump sum of cash, where as Peaches inherits a bible.  Peaches decides that she's tired and decided to leave without hearing anything else from Granny.

Peaches is that typical beautician with a million pictures on her station whose made appointments that she's late for!  As she walks in stylyin', gossiping and showing off her latest achievement she's visted by the IRS and has been given two options... What's a girl to do?

Peaches chooses a chance to hit sunny LA as an request from Angela's staff.

Big sister Angela is embarking on five years as a SUCCESSFUL hair salon owner of an upscale salon in the elite Beverly Hills area.  It's all business for this obviously lonely sister, with the misfortune of dealing with a former mentor whose so petty, envious, and jealous.

As the sisters reunite you see that sisterly bond grows tighter.  Peaches is liking her taste of L.A. style, and Angela's round the way attitude opens the staff up to another side of her.

It's a good story about how the two learn to work together and appreciate the other one.

Now you know that there is some drama, plenty of he say she say, down low brothers, and a couple of big names.  Not to mention insight into something Chicago's known for ""HAIR SHOWS!""",1099872000,,1485,4.7315175097276265

The reunion is bittersweet and worsens when Angela finds out that Peaches is on the run from the IRS and has only a few days to pay $50,000 in back taxes. After some hilarious moments and passionate exchanges the two sisters join forces to fight off a pesky rival salon owner Marcella and save Peaches from her troubles by competing for a lucrative cash prize and bragging rights at the city's annual hair show. Hair Show proves that blood and family run thicker than water. The comedy was brilliant and truley hiliarious.",1262476800,,725,4.808

2105136,3,B0002MHEUA,"...but I see why it went straight to DVD. It's not BarberShop nor is it BeautySHop, so don't purchase it because of that. This movie has it's own redeeming values..

The plot is essentially good sister does good...bad sister, does bad, runs away from problems and tries to do good.

I enjoyed the plot,the characters and the redeeming theme.

As usual Mo'Nique did her thing with the comedic talent...and it was equally appealing seeing Kelita Smith broaden her acting chops.",1153958400,,475,4.9125
2105137,5,B0002MHEUA,"I really enjoyed this movie because it shows that just because you are big and a yourself doesn't mean you can't get the guy. Monique always makes me feel that no matter what size I am, I AM Somebody and a beauty to behold. The movie was simply made, but I enjoyed the friendliness. It was great. Monique, you go girl!!",1145318400,,319,4.245901639344262
2105138,4,B0002MHEUA,"I got this movie because after a search it was the only one I could find for Keiko Agena that plays Lane Kim on Gilmore girls TV progam. She plays a totally different charactor in this movie though, one that does not smile much and does not seem to be a very happy person. I like the charactor she plays on the Gilmore girls a lot better. At least there they use costume to get a little comic effect out of her. She tends to hide her body and not use it as much as she could. She would be a lot closer to using her body for comedy like Lucy or Julia Roberts. She would have more distance to go to be really sexy looking and even then she would be sexy in a funny way. Perhaps she needs someone like Garry Marshall to really help her to develop herself and to more solid back up rolls like she does as Rorys best frind on the Gilmore's. It would be nice if she at least got more bit parts like Sookie. You tend to she her show up all over the place. Nothing big but at least they invite her onto the set for a day for a little bit of something.",1129939200,,1043,3.9014084507042255

I enjoyed the perfomances and I had an overall good time watching the film. People need to stop over analyzing the movie...it's entertaining...yes it's predictable just like most movies...don't get it twisted...it's not like it's a suspense film or something....",1122681600,6,461,5.078947368421052
