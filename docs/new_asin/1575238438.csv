I've worked on Systems development projects that had similar chemistry.  We started with what we believed to be a solid concept and requirements to accomplish major programming work.  As we progressed, just like the airport effort, we had to add unplanned steps and tasks that added seemingly endless difficulty to the successful (? a matter of opinion) completion of the project.  I'm sorry this isn't available on VHS or DVD.  The corporate world could take a lesson - or give one.)",1215216000,,651,4.935779816513762
7798899,5,1575238438,"This 52-minute video documents the fascinating story of Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan.
Built on a man-made island (constructed solely for the purpose of providing space for an airport), Kansai International is truly an amazing engineering achievement.  Unfortunately, as revealed in this program, the airport is now slowly sinking into the ocean beneath it!
This program gives the viewer a rare insight into the construction of this massive airport, as well as a glimpse at some of the airlines and widebodied jetliners that have served it since the facility opened in 1994.",1067385600,,589,5.333333333333333
7798900,5,1575238438,I am a very big fan of just about anything dealing with this and other related subjects and I can tell u i enjoyed watching this hour long video on one of the worlds most magnificent airports. The detail that they go into on its construction is great and with all the areial shots of the airport and the airlinse that use it it makes me want to sit and watch it over every time. I hope someday to visit not so much as to visit the city of Osaka but just to see this marvel.,972950400,8,473,3.9375
