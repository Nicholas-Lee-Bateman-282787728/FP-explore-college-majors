A man and his son talk about Utopia (nowhere). Then armed men in trucks arrive in their village and start shooting people and chopping off hands! There is a civil war in Sierra Leone (Lion Mountain). The West wants to ban the sale of rough diamonds. [Competition to the South African diamond cartel.] People are captured to work in mining diamonds. There is a harsh penalty for theft! An arms trader arrives to make a deal with Commander Zero, guns for diamonds. Next we see a writer for National Geographic with his goats. Miners try to hide diamonds. Government troops attack the rebels. People read lists of names (missing or dead). We see the oppression of people by armed men. Mercenary soldiers are used by the Government to oppose the rebels and take over the diamond fields. [War is about loot.]

Diamond sellers meet customer demands for shiny jewelry. [Diamonds are forever, unless they are destroyed by high heat.] Government soldiers arrive to shoot up the town and create a massacre! People hide in homes! Life is nasty, short, and ugly. An American reporter helps Danny. She films the refugees in camps. Solomon greets his daughter and learns about his missing son. The reporter needs someone who will go on record about Blood Diamonds to affect purchases in the West. [Economics drives politics.] Danny tells how diamonds are exported as legitimate. He has a list of names and bank accounts. The road trip is halted by shooting. Young boys are trained to use AK-47 assault rifles. The bus is shot up, but Danny and Matty Burns escape with Solomon into the bush. We are friends. A camera calms the militia. Are people inherently good? [Statistics suggest otherwise.]

Danny talks about his past. His dream is to get a large diamond and leave Africa. There is an incident and a shooting! Troops will pacify the area, civilians will be evacuated (no witnesses). Danny is obsessed with getting a pink diamond. Danny and Solomon run back, there is danger when they are discovered, but they escape. Danny calls in the location of the Rebel Camp to the Government Troops. Solomon watches the boy soldiers, there is a mistake! He is threatened with horrors unless he finds that hidden diamond. Airplanes attack the camp, kill them all! Solomon is enraged. Troops on the ground complete the slaughter. Now the Colonel wants that diamond; he knows about Solomons son

Will there be a double-cross? There is a surprise! Solomon can take his son home. Danny calls for the small airplane to take him away. Danny was wounded, he returns the diamond to Solomon so he can leave with his son. More soldiers approach, there is more shooting. Danny makes a phone call to Matty. Solomon gets his wife and child back, then calls for the rough diamond. Later he speaks at a press conference against looting a countrys resources. It is up to the customers to demand diamonds that are not illegal. [Does a cartel want to keep prices high and avoid competition from lower priced diamonds?]

This movie exposes the horrors of civil war in Sierra Leone, but doesnt go into the details (a book would provide more information). The smuggling and import of these diamonds competes with the South African diamond cartel. Diamonds are Forever is an earlier movie.",1423353600,,3272,4.825311942959002
