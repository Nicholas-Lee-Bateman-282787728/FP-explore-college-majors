300229,5,6300276945,"A few months ago I passed Barry Levinson at a social function.  I asked him why Tin Men hd not been released on DVD...he told that he was working on it.  Wow was it worth the wait.  The new print, the deleted scene and the cast talk over were all great.  This comic gem is the best of the Baltimore films.  Finaly all the Baltimore films on on DVD.  A great collection to have if you get Tin Men along with Diner, Avalon & Liberty Height...It will make four nights of great viewing.  This is Leveinson at his best, witty, dramtic and real.",1018224000,,539,4.174757281553398
300230,5,6300276945,"One of my favorite movies from the late 80's, TIN MEN is about two rival aluminum siding salesmen (Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito) who plot to get even with each other after a fender-bender escalates into an all-out war.  But the plot runs second, however, to the delightful supporting characters that writer/director Barry Levinson has created to provide the film with most of its comic zest.  The film also features one of the late, great J.T. Walsh's finest performances in a small but typically-Walsh role, and a pre-""Frasier"" John Mahoney as another ""tin man"".  This would be Richard Dreyfuss' finest comic role until ""Let It Ride"" a mere two years later.  You'll NEVER trust salesmen again after seeing this movie, not that you do now.",1017705600,4,744,4.928
300231,5,6300276945,"Tin Men is driven by an incredibly witty script. The dialogs are sharp, hilarious and competitive as tennis matches. In so many films DeVito and Dreyfuss are burdened by the need to make the script funny; but in Tin Men they are free to show how good they can be as character actors. They are, both, brilliant.",980121600,,310,4.456140350877193

300234,5,6300276945,"I know that phrase is overused, but this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Danny Devito, Richard Dryfuss, and Barbara Hershey (before the new lips) are wonderful in this movie and the supporting players fill it  out with amazing charm and wit.  Some of the best stuff that happens in the  movie is just characters sitting around together being themselves.  Don't  let me give you the idea that this is a boring movie--there is a senate  investigation and hearings, divorce, dancing, car crashes, IRS seizure, and  street fighting.  It's wonderful and I highly recommend you see it.",945216000,,590,4.82
300235,4,6300276945,"This movie is a classic work that has received very little ink. The story line is a classic out of the fast talking salesmanship of the early 1960s.  War War II vets as well as others were looking for opportunity to make a  buck selling products door-to-door. Remember all the vacuum cleaner  salesmen?  What ""Tin Men"" captures is the the down side of  competition. Fortunately, for the movie, this brings out the best of the  two main characters. Both have a lust for shiney Cadillacs, an idea for a  good scam, and are under a great deal of stress. When these to rivals  collide, literally, the movie takes off. The two aluminum siding salesmen's  game of brinkmenship spirals out of control.  Great flick!",941328000,2,708,4.682926829268292
300236,5,6300276945,"From the period-piece opening scene, with the silky voice of Nat King Cole crooning as the camera affectionately caresses the curves of a new, early sixties Cadillac, to the end of the film, when the furiously feuding  Richard Drefus and Danny Devito are finally pushed into mutual forgiveness,  this film stands alone.  There is no other comedy, romantic or otherwise,  to which this one can be compared.  It has a feel of its own, a fluidity of  movement from farce to irony to romance to (just the right touch of)  tragedy.
The depiction of early sixties Baltimore is superb.  The fact  that the abundance of Cadillacs is just a little over-played actually adds  to the delightful whackiness of this wonderful film.
Terrific  performances by Barbara Hershey, Richard Drefus, Danny Devito -- and, above  all, the British-born actor, John Mahoney, make this film a treat at every  viewing.  Mahoney, whom no one would ever identify as anthing other than  100 percent American in looks and in voice, almost steals the show with his  portrayal of Moe, Drefus's patient partner in scam.
Technically,  ""Tin Men"" is a masterpiece of editing.  Example: when Devito's  character smashes his adversary's Cadillac windows, we see each blow to  each window just as the crowbar crashes through the glass -- we don't see  the assailant walking around the car; we don't see his back-swing -- just  one crowbar blow after another, viewed from inside the car, with Devito's  delightfully wicked expression of glee behind each frame.  Bang bang bang.  It's brilliant.
I think this is a very underrated and under-appreciated  film.  I'd recommend it to anyone.",926640000,7,1644,5.014869888475836

Does a great job of capturing the era, as I understand it.

300371,4,6300276945,"I'd wanted to see this for a long time, and it did not disappoint.  Yes, it was picaresque in the extreme... duh... but the acting was fantastic, the dialog was snappy and funny as all hell, and the actual motivations of the characters came thru all the theatrical trappings... which many reviewers may have given too-short shrift.

DeVito, Dreyfus, and Hershey all did fantastic acting jobs... really fantastic.  Barbara Hershey deserves special mention for the excellence with which she portrayed a character somewhere between downtrodden and special.

I am dumbfounded that this did not receive any awards, at least according to Wikipedia.  Unless 1987 was a genuine bumper year, the absence of awards was, on some level, a miscarriage of justice [and, no, I have no time to look at 1987's awards list... just to give my 2-cent opinion].  Maybe not Oscar material, but definitely award-worthy.

The only criticism I would make is that some of the scenes dragged a bit about 2/3 of the way into it, and they might have trimmed about 10 minutes off the move, though not 15.  But that's hardly a criticism, just an observation.

300514,4,6300276945,"If you really want to find the essence of American urban life in the 1950's and 1960's, just spend a few hours at either an east-coast diner or in a 1960 Cadillac. Sometimes I think Barry Levinson must have owned a Cadillac and driven to diners where he overheard dialog which he scribbled into a notebook. (His first movie was of course called ""Diner"".) Levinson has captured the atmosphere of the era through his realistic dialog that seems lifted straight from the dirty tables and dry pancakes. A bunch of friends eating at a diner and yapping about TV shows and broads is what real east-coast urban American life is all about. And when these guys are not drinking coffee and dividing up the check, they're driving their Cadillacs to potential customers to sell aluminum siding. This is the second of Levinson's Baltimore trilogy.

The term ""tin men"" referred to aluminum siding salesmen who were just a cut under car salesmen and just above con artists. In the 1950's and 1960's when competition tightened, some of these salesmen used seemingly innocent but deceptive tactics on a very naive and trusting public who have since gotten very wise to this kind of manipulation. These hard-sell approaches included bate and switch, falsely promising free extras, and fabricating associations with nationwide magazines. Barry Levinson thrusts us into the middle of a rivalry between two of the more devious of aluminum siding salesmen, played by two of the most nervous-angst actors in the business: Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfus. The casting of these two against each other has to have been from heaven. The smart-alec Dreyfus versus the self-centered DeVito makes for a clash of the urban sales titans early 1960's style.

DeVito and Dreyfus literally ""run into each other"" and begin a heated game of oneupmanship that at first involves their cars and then DeVito's wife played with subtle realism by Barbara Hershey. (Of course the biggest mystery of the film is how Hershey ended up with DeVito in the first place but that could be the subject of a PhD dissertation.) The cars owned by the salesmen are important enough to also be characters. This game of king of the hill is at the forefront of the shady practices enacted by the tin men to get customers. Some of the most interesting aspects of the film are the games they play to make sales. Their customers are often very simple and trusting folk who don't realize they are being taken by sharks. But looming in the background is the US Housing Commission who are starting to become wise to their practices.

A very enjoyable film overall, completely unpredictable, with fantastic performances by the three leads DeVito, Dreyfus, and Hershey. Of course, would you buy anything from these guys? I'm sure you never thought your house could use some aluminum siding.",1433462400,,2823,4.901673640167364

300574,5,6300276945,"I don't recall what initially drew me to this movie. The one-sheet (poster) doesn't give away much in the way of plot, so I assumed it was a film about used car salesmen in the era of ""shark fins."" I did know that the pairing of one of my favorite (and underrated and under-appreciated) actors Richard Dreyfuss with Danny DeVito was a plus, and this teaming did not disappoint! It's the story of two aluminum siding salesmen (Tin Men) in 1960's Baltimore. DeVito accidentally bumps into Dreyfuss's new Caddy and from there these two build into the greatest game of one-upsmanship since  Sam Sheepdog and Ralph Wolf met in ""Looney Tunes land!"" They both sparkle here, but Dreyfuss shows more character depth when he vengefully seduces DeVito's wife, and unexpectedly really falls in love with her. The scene where he tells her the truth of while he slept with her originally , but is now in love with her,is portrayed with such honesty that you can forgive this man for doing this most heinous act. Barbara Hershey, as DeVito's wife, delivers a fine performance as well, as she portrays a woman who feels ""trapped"" with an unlucky, lovable loser, but in a nice twist, isn't in love with Dreyfuss either. Underlying all of this is the pressure these men face, on a daily basis, to sell a product that people really don't want or feel they need. The weekly, liquor soaked meetings where they are harangued by an intimidating J. T. Walsh, gives us an unflinching glimpse into what drives the desperation that these men carry along with their samples. Overall this film is a finely crafted character study by the always solid Berry Levinson.",1423353600,2,1636,4.7403508771929825

TIN MEN: Baltimore, 1963: Aluminum siding salesman Bill BB Babowski (Dreyfuss) drives his new Cadillac off the lotand is promptly hit by Tilley (DeVito), in *his* Cadillac. Its hate at first sight: Im gonna get even with you, BB vows. You picked the wrong person to get even with, pal, Tilley fires back. They discover that, oddly enough, they're both tin mensiding salesmen for rival companies. BBs career is on a roll, though, while Tilleys is in a slumpjust like his marriage to frumpy Nora (Hershey).

BB and Tilley cross paths a couple more times, doing damage to each others cars, but BB escalates his revenge by picking up and seducing Nora. Unexpected complications arise: Tilley is glad to be rid of her, for instance. And BB and Nora begin actually falling for each other. But if she ever finds out why he really seduced her in the first place...

Discussion: Its more than a carits a status symbol. And its more than a dented fenderits a bruised male ego. The men are as skilled at macho posing as they are in scamming their clients, but the minute a womanor an emotion unfamiliar to many macho males, like tenderness, or affectionenters the picture, they're lost.

Tin Men is a perfect example of a character-driven plot: The characters themselves, and no one else, are responsible for their miserable situations. Nora makes an amazing transformation in the escalating vendetta from pawn to strong-willed woman who discovers what she wants and learns how to fight for it. And the men discover that their fates are intimately intertwinedbut as two sides of a coin. The ironic reversal in the final scenes reveals they are in fact mirrors for one another, and its difficult to love a mirror if you hate yourself. The middle act drags a bit, but its more than made up for by the wry dialog, the undercurrent of humor, the first-rate performances, and the films subtle ruminations on honesty and deception, whether on the job, in the home...or in the mirror.",1422921600,,2221,4.687179487179487

The story is cute - about two aluminum siding salesmen who get into a ""war"" over a car accident  and it morphs into the girlfriend being used as a pawn in the battle.  What makes this movie so much fun is the dialogue in the diner - where the salesmen have coffee and breakfast and talk.  It is so funny; a lot like we talk in groups but don't hear our conversations from the outside and don't realize how funny we are to an outsider.  Also, this is chock full of old cars so it's eye candy for the auto enthusiast.  And the acting is superb - timing is great.

A classic treat with Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfus participating in an over-the-top vendetta which starts with dueling big-fin Caddys and concludes with a billiards game to decide who ends up with DeVito's character's wife (drop-dead gorgeous Barbara Hershey).  The dialogue is priceless, especially the scenes where the tin men critique Bonanza.  Your sides will hurt from laughter over DeVito's scene at the smorgasbord salad buffet line, looking for God.  John Mahoney (later, Fraser Crane's father) also has a great supporting role as the ""king"" of Tin Men with his smooth sales techniques and ""bait & switch"" tactics.  Additionally, great scenery shot in several Baltimore neighborhoods (Pimlico, area around Memorial Stadium, vintage row houses, and the Fells Point Diner, of course).

The comical plot revolves around two aluminum siding salesmen (Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito) who become embroiled in a protracted, and at times, violent feud over a minor car accident.  This escalates into Dreyfuss seducing Barbara Hershey, DeVito's character's innocent and neglected wife and further complications ensue.  The times, they are a changing!

But the real star is the innocence of the era, pre-Kennedy assassination, pre-Vietnam, pre-women's lib.

300831,5,6300276945,"Twenty years past its release date, Tin Men remains a keeper.  Danny DeVito may have worn out his exasperated/enraged small man schtick by now, but in 1987 it was still fresh.  Like Diner, Tin Men is set in end-of-an-era Baltimore, 1963, and so much that is in it has disappeared or declined.  Crowd noise from old Memorial Stadium fills a part of one scene and the camera captures those brick row houses that lined the streets around the stadium in their prime.  The Life Magazine scam scene and the diner and driving riffs on Bonanza are laugh out loud funny.  In an excellent cast -- not only of leads, but with some of the era's best supporting players --, Barbara Hershey as the wife caught between the tantrums of shady aluminum siding salesmen stands out.  And the fender level camera view of the tin men parking their perfect Cadillacs is auto nostalgia at its best.  Overall, Tin Men serves up that nostalgia, but also wry look at human nature, and a well-shot picture of a working and living city into an enduring package.

Following on from `Diner', its quirky humor lies in the everyday banter of the characters, for which the actors seem to have been given freedom to ad lib. Charm and authenticity are added by Levinson's attention to detail, in what is a sixties period movie.

Women be warned. When my sister saw this at the theatre, she was so bored she walked out before the end. My girl friend had a similar reaction when watching at home. At first this puzzled me, as I absolutely loved the film. However, you need to have a male psyche to understand it. The story revolves around two competing male egos and the girl caught in the middle. There are allusions to the male obsession for new cars, the pride that believes you can always beat the other guy at pool, and the `getting the girl' just to prove that you can.

Great characters, innovative directing, and sparkling acting by the lead roles in Dreyfuss, DeVito and Hershey, makes you think that they had a lot of fun making this film.

Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss play the roles of two aluminum siding salesmen from rival companies.

They are hilarious anyway but together and with this script, VERY funny.  This is a time capsule of the old-time salesman with the constant patter full of jokes and flattery, the consumer cons and sunny attitude toward a new day full of prospects. The ""intellectual"" discussion amongst the salesmen over Senor Wences and over the realism of Bonanza are priceless. Of note is one of the all-too-few appearances by J. T.

300882,5,6300276945,"A short while back, I somewhat accidentally came upon the newly released widescreen DVD of Tin Men, Barry Levinson's 1987 follow up to his remarkable 1982 Diner.  I hadn't seen this movie for quite a while and was expecting an entertaining thoughtful movie-experience in light of my recent appreciation of having just seen Diner for the first time in a few years.

 I recalled enjoying Tin Men when it was originally released in theaters, but I was wonderfully surprised that it was even better than I'd remembered.

I think Tin Men is a significantly ""better"" film than Diner.  While the latter is a fantastically written and directed, assembly of choice intimate moments in the lives of a few remarkably entertaining boys (and one girl) on the teetering verge of new adulthood, Tin Men is much more.  The same seemingly stream-of-consciousness throw-away snappy-patter permeates the experience, but the situations are much more ""adult..."" sorta.

Overall, Tin Men is a technically much more evolved movie than Diner, and while I don't prescribe to the notion that technical prowess is tantamount to perfection, I also don't think that clumsy, inept movie-making is the key to ""good"" colloquial  entertainment, ""indie"" or otherwise (although I'm sure it is to some people).  While someone like a Kevin Smith plays at the contrivances of continually remaking an amateur movie, Barry graduates from a mere excellent movie-maker to an incredibly wonderful movie maker.

With Tin Men, Levinson has learned even more about the emotional contributions of music, lighting, camera movement, interesting frame composition (although this may indeed be the developing artistic eye of Cinematographer, Peter Sova), and most important; the art of ""naturally"" evolving his characters in very compelling light.  The story takes a back-seat to the lives and emotionally-natural free-fall of his main characters.

The performances are quite remarkable.  Richard Dreyfus and Danny DeVitto - being the focal points for the two ""families"" of tin men that inter-react - have a fascinating and very complicated rapport.  Dreyfus' performance is especially interesting in light of what is said by him in the commentary.  Barbara Hershey's performance doesn't seem to have as much range as the rest of the ensemble, but fits quite naturally amid all the turmoil expressed by the other main characters and their entourage.  It's interesting to realize that Tin Men and Diner are mostly about Boy's Clubs with the pivot of action revolving and resolving around the singular female lead.

One of Levinson's strengths is his ability to interest a movie-going audience in what is essentially a play, in that, the forward motion of the experience is driven almost entirely by dialogue, and he does it with a most wonderful quiet panache.

One of the rumors I've heard since its initial release is that the Micky Rourke character in ""Diner"" was supposed to be the same character as the Richard Dreyfece character, albeit grown up.  The only clue I've found being the last comments about aluminum-siding from the friend of Boogie's (Micky Rourke) father who saves Boogie from a beating in the last few minutes of Diner.

All in all, a wonderful experience with a great and informative commentary, especially suited for a burgeoning writer or director.

Soon we have smashed car windows, eggs and potatoes, and a broken marriage. That's not all, we also get some very interesting dialogue; how about how ridiculous 'Bonanza' is, the mis-pleasures of picnics, hearing DeVito repeat the words 'Ease off!"", expert Morangai dancing, and ""are they salesmen or hustlers?""

Funny? I've never thought it was particularly funny. It's simply too genuine, so engrossing that you may forget all about  laughter, as I did, but you'll find comedy here if you wish.

300916,4,6300276945,"After a minor fender bender and a heated argument, two men become locked in a battle of 'one upping' each other in a quest for revenge.  Written and directed by Barry Levinson (Diner, Avalon, Rain Man, Wag the Dog), Tin Men stars Richard Dreyfuss as Bill ""BB"" Babowsky and Danny DeVito as Ernest Tilley.
Set around 1962, the title, Tin Men, refers to aluminum siding salesmen.  This is the profession of both BB and Tiley, although they work for rival companies.  Throughout the movie, we are treated to different shady tactics employed by these salesmen to peddle their wares.  A wonderfully funny movie, Dreyfuss and DeVito play their parts so well, taking two fairly unscrupulous characters and making them somewhat likable.  They are supported by an excellent cast including Barbara Hersey as Tilley's wife, John Mahoney, Jackie Gayle, Seymour Cassel, and Bruno Kirby.
The main crux of the movie revolves around BB and Tilley going back and forth, supported by subplots involving a failing marriage, an investigation by a governmental agency into improper business tactics, and a budding romance.  The film did slow down a little near the end in tying up the various plot threads, but that mattered little to me, as it's a treat to see so much talent properly utilized.  The casting is dead on, the dialog truly quotable and seemingly appropriate for the time, and the direction very professional.  The musical score was well chosen, but I did wonder about the use of the band Fine Young Cannibals.  Their signature song, Good Thing, fit the scene it was in nicely, but I've always had a bit of an issue with the use of contemporary music in movies set in the past.  I'd rather see music of the period incorporated, with credit going to the artists of the time.
The movie is presented in wide screen, and extras include a trailer, a deleted scene, and a commentary with most all major contributors to this movie, except Danny DeVito.  I haven't had a chance to listen to the commentary, but given the people involved, I'll venture to bet it's pretty entertaining and informative.",1068422400,17,2083,4.83943661971831
300917,5,6300276945,"Most movies try and take you to a place you normally could never experience.  This is not one of those films.  Tin Men, is the kind of story that in some form or another, mimics most of our own lives. The main characters are two salesmen who sell aluminum siding. They live in a time when aluminum siding was relatively new product, and sometimes apply some shady tactics to make a sale.  Despite that, this film is not about a time of corruption in the home improvement industry. I believe the editorial review might have that wrong.  Rather, it's about the everyday working lives, loves, and times, of working men in this kind of business.
Every story needs conflict, and this one begins with a minor traffic accident between Danny Devito, and Richard Dreyfuss's characters. Both are ""Tin"" salesmen who drive Cadillac's, because they believe it will impress their customers.  As the battle of pettiness wages between these two men, we get to peer into their everyday lives. The battle escalates to the point of great humor, but never goes over the line, to hatred and cruelty.
Barbara Hershey plays Devito's long-suffering wife, who is romanced by Richard Dreyfuss's character BB. It's an attempt by him to gain the ultimate revenge.  While I won't reveal the plot here, suffice it to say it does not turn out the way he thinks.  This is a movie you should see during a quiet time.  I had originally watched it when I was distracted at college, and got almost nothing from it.  I couldn't even remember much of the movie, and didn't think I liked it.  Later, when a friend rented it, I saw it in a calmer state, and I realized it was a great movie.
The score is excellent, blending songs by Fine Young Cannibals, with Frank Sinatra and others.  The backdrop is 1960s Baltimore, and it presents a time in America, rarely presented in a period piece. When I try to explain why I like this film to others, it seems next to impossible.

The Capulet and Montegue competition between the competing aluminum siding companies is hillarious and the gags the guys pull on the poor sods who they're selling the stuff to just cracks me up every time I see it.

Well I'm glad to report that this hilarious, nostalgic comedy has been brought to light in the DVD format. The film takes place in Baltimore, (Circa 1963), where we are introduced to the world of the 'Tin Men'. These are notorius, aluminum siding salesmen, who will use any con or scheme to get customers to sign on the dotted line of a contract. We are intoduced to two such 'tin men'(wonderfully played by Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito) when they both accidentally hit each other in their Cadillacs. From then on a war of words and pranks begins. This escalates to the point that the Dreyfuss character has an affair with DeVito's wife (well played by Barbra Hershey). Eventually the affair, which started out as a form of revenge, blossoms into love. While this film is very funny it plays out against a melancholic background, because the story gives you the feeling, that the days of the 'tin men' have come and gone. Their livelyhood's days are numbered and in order for these men to survive they will have to move on. The acting in this movie is great. All three lead actors in this film (Dreyfuss, DeVito, Hershey)play their roles to perfection. This is an ensemble that really works. Barry Levinson has written and directed a story that is both humorus and touching. We really care about these characters. The dialogue is also first rate. In the tradition of the other Baltimore films, many of the characters have hilarious conversations about the smallest details in life. My personal favorite scene is when one of the salesmen obsessively keeps going on and on about how unrealistic the TV show 'Bonanza' is (""Who ever heard of a 50 year old guy with three 47 year old sons?"").The DVD to this film is clear and crisp. It has trailers, deleted scenes, and a wonderful commentary track which includes Levinson and many of the priciple players.

There is little more to the plot than two aluminum siding salesmen's attempts to get even with each other after a vehicle accident sparks off a feud. It is the sixties Baltimore setting, the humour, and the characters that make this an incredible movie.
The minor characters seem to be lifted straight from the stories of Damon Runyan, with their amusing foibles, their unintended witticisms, and their exotic, yet totally sincere, ways of looking at the world. The backdrop of the aluminum siding industry is, in a sense, fittingly surreal for the extraordinary world these characters inhabit. The central performances by Richard Dreyfuss and Danny De Vito are great, and the actors are not failed by a script that breathes vibrancy and wit.",1025481600,4,820,4.906474820143885

OK, then ya got your detailed discussions of why none of the male characters in the Bonanza TV show ('member that one?) ever talk about gettin' any, and other sacred topics of discussion, all rendered in pitch-perfect Baltimorese, as well as the Home Improvement Commisssion, the IRS, and office politics--all done up by a really talented buncha guys like Seymour Cassel, J.T. Walsh (my fave!), John Mahoney, Bruno Kirby, and the hilarious Jackie Gayle--and you have one heckuva great film.
The emotional stuff is really well done--not stupid or schlocky--and the funny stuff is really funny.  Yeah, there is emotional stuff, when the Richard Dreyfuss character, BB, steals Tilly (Danny DeVito's) wife played by Barbara Hershey and he falls for her, pretty hard.  This is one film that does a great job of blending the emotional and the funny stuff perfectly.  Not only that, but here DeVito is himself absolutely perfect as the selfish guy only somebody just like him could really love and Dreyfuss is great too.
They don't make comedies like this any more, and when you realize this was made about 15 years ago, that's pretty sad.  With Wag the Dog, this is definitely one of Barry Levinson's best films--
