Construction of the monastery was from 1387 to 1517. A nineteenth century rehabilitation fixed some of the aging parts of the physical plant and continued maintenance into the present keeps this facility in excellent condition. In the Founders Chapel is the sarcophagus of John I and Queen Philippa with their likenesses atop the stone enclosure.,1419033600,,542,5.241379310344827
