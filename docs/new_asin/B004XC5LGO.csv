4493746,5,B004XC5LGO,"Gotta say. I really love the title of this film and the cover..usually that will draw me in to at least watching the first 10 min of a film. This one kept my interest. I enjoyed the characters, action and overall flow of the film. You can tell it's an indie release but it still packs some punches. I see movies like this and imagine what could have been done with an ever bigger budget and a few kinks worked out. I still really enjoyed my time with Minty and recommend it to those that like guns, girls and revenge flicks!",1490313600,3,524,4.198019801980198
4493747,3,B004XC5LGO,"Cheesy,campy, funny, well done. I would have given 4 stars but for the (for me) lousy soundtrack. Had a plot, some funny moments, kinda like a Woody Allan/Kung Fu mix. Enough to be entertaining and not totally bad. Dialogue wasn't done by a 14 year old potty mouth. Plot was predictable but not enough to bore you. Of all the crap movies out there this is worth a watch, only once, and only if you get it free on Prime.",1489795200,4,419,4.25
4493748,2,B004XC5LGO,"I watched about 20 minutes and could not get in to this movie. hot women, lesbian vampires and zombies with guns, I should love this but just didn't, You may like it, I didn't, Good Luck",1487808000,2,186,4.194444444444445
4493749,2,B004XC5LGO,"Just an average, low budget flick. Little nudity, bad acting & worse script but cheesy so it's ok.",1456963200,2,98,4.5
4493750,1,B004XC5LGO,"Makes ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" look good. Bad acting! Bad story line! Would recommend only to those who like very bad movies.",1375315200,6,126,4.521739130434782

Enter MINTY the Assassin

She's what every single FanBoy wants, and it's not her autograph.
So says the stories villain, Dr. Mind Bender.

Besides arousing her to ten times the level of the average female,
chocolate also makes her ten times stronger than the average person.

Lesbian vampires, zombies, and characters who have comic books written after them who have so much character
it will make anyone watching do the only thing that separates us from the animals...blush.

Dr. Mind Bender is playing a dangerous, mind bending game, and MINTY is trying to find out
what the hell is going on as she fights to save her friend and teacher, Big Boss from the Clock Tower.

If none of this makes any sense, watch MINTY...all will be revealed.",1351728000,8,819,4.856115107913669

4493762,1,B004XC5LGO,"I could write a detailed explanation on the 1 star review, but I feel most individuals watching this kind of stuff must feel a compulsion to watch garbage. I understand the draw of watching B movies, but there comes a point when most of the B movie goers say this is bad, maybe you should listen. This is truly bad on many levels and the story implies a sexy, sultry theme,.. there is none of that. I'm sorry but this is a complete waste of time,.. even for a B movie.",1491696000,,468,4.153846153846154
8446605,5,B004XC5LGO,"Minty: The Assassin is pure comic book capers brought into movie action and prominently feature the mint chocolate bar munching heroine Minty who takes on a variety of opponents including vampires, zombies, ninjas, zen cowboys with glorious and appropriate comic names such as Sensational Ninja, Bruce Zee, Molly Leviathon, Zen Cowboy and Rat Monster. She goes about her task with gusto whilst displaying her martial arts fighting skills in what turns out to be a very entertaining action/adventure brew. There is something for everybody - a villain for all tastes. Minty displays great powers of perseverance in overcoming the driving forces of these villains en-route to rescuing a friend and eventually assassinating a evil, manipulative, mind controlling doctor. In addition to her acrobatic fighting skills, Minty must also utilise profound intellectual abilities especially when contemplating physics and the universe! Elina fits into the role perfectly as she is able to fully utilise her extensive and varied TV, stage and film experience to good effect as can be appreciated by her body movements (especially in the opening sequence), poses, expressions and eye contact with camera. She would make an excellent photographic model!

The use of cartoon style drawings and animations as scene setters serves to constantly remind the viewer that the story is basically comic book inspired adventure movie. I appreciate that the special graphic effects and animations may appear to be basic and straightforward and some people would have been tempted to utilise to a greater extent the more sophisticated techniques and resources currently available. But by limiting the use of graphics and animations to just appropriate moments as on this occasion the film makers have sensibly served to emphasis that this is just an extension of a comic book.

There are numerous other positives to savour in this film including the performances of Tabitha Taylor who plays Double Delicious - a vampire. This is a role which is tailor made for Tabitha and she plays it with the right injection of humour as and when required. Another actress who captured the attention in a brief role was Jacki R Chan in her well choreographed fight sequence with Elina. A word of praise must also be extended for the soundtrack which contains a variety of musical styles.

If you want to watch a film designed to provide a bit of comic relief and brighten up your day then Minty: The Assassin is a worthy addition to the list of films which will effortlessly achieve such an objective. It is one of those sit back and enjoy the action and fun type of movies.",1523750400,,2634,5.07852193995381

Forced myself to watch through the opening credits, mainly because the play between cartoon and live action was a good effect, but it was a false hope on my part. Gave up during the Darwin conversation. Couldn't see this ever rising to the level of stupid.",1494892800,,358,4.682539682539683

8446612,1,B004XC5LGO,"This is probably the worst film I have ever seen. Everything was soooo bad. The actors, the script even its attempt to comedy fell flat. The only good thing about this film is when it ended. Do not torture yourself; please do not watch this film!",1494115200,,246,4.369565217391305
8446613,1,B004XC5LGO,"I can't shake the feeling that the people making this knew they didn't have the chops to pull it off and decided if they winked at the audience enough it would pass as ""Troma-esque"". Well, now that I re-read that sentence, I realize that I hate the Troma films too so maybe I'm just not the intended audience. But anyway.
Since the two main women in the film have a) very large breasts and b) that flat, affected way of talking so common in porn, I'm assuming they are porn performers and were just happy that they didn't have to have sex at work for once. Maybe I'm assuming too much, but I'm trying to keep positive, and if they are porn actors then this thing probably counted as a paid vacation for them, which is a nice thought, don't you think?
The core idea by itself isn't terrible, but the execution is. Terrible script, terrible acting, terrible fight choreography, terrible effects.",1494115200,,893,4.518518518518518
