8436869,3,B004NYYDVQ,"John Fahey was a guitar hero long before I even knew what a guitar hero was. I was drawn to his music as a child listening to it when I was visiting my older sister & her 1st husband in the 60's. It's almost impossible to explain why or the way his music connected with me at such a young age. I have amassed a pretty large collection of  video & audio of his music. I'm not sorry at all I purchased this video but I have to say some of this video is painfully slow. I found myself fast fwding through some of it. He was some what idiosyncratic as a musician where some artists would end a song he would just keep driving the hooks of the songs making them boring & redundant at best. I saw him in concert only once in the early 90's at a church in SF & was thoroughly entertained through out the whole show. There are some classic JF tunes well played in this video but as I stated some of the tunes are painfully long & way to drawn out. There is no such thing as a casual Fahey fan so I don't think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this video but be prepared to do some fast fwding through some of the slower parts.

8436870,5,B004NYYDVQ,"This is another is really fine series of ""Guitar Artistry of...."" Videos from Stefan Grossman's Vestapol label. Grossman, a fine guitarist in his own right, and a long time student of Rev. Gary Davis, has been releasing video since back in the old VHS days. Though some contained performances, Grossman's main product was the guitar tutorial: a series of video lessons by some of the true experts in finger picking.

As a person who loves to hear good guitar playing but is ""all-thumbs"" when it comes to actually playing, I always look forward to a new video of performance - or, as in the case of this DVD, interview and performance. And this volume with the legendary John Fahey is one of the best.

I've known Fahey's music since the 1960s when I first heard his Takoma records label. (You will hear how the label started if you watch this DVD.) But I don't ever remember seeing him play, until now. The 2  hour long ""main program,"" consists of a NEWLY recorded interview (actually a question is raised and you see and hear Fahey's reply) mixed with earlier performances - mostly in a studio, though there is an audience for some. There are 16 songs lasting from under two minutes to one that goes on for 13 minutes! Fahey's stories are wonderful. The ones he tells about hanging around with Elizabeth Cotton (composer of ""Freight Rain"") are my favorites. Raised in the urban East near Washington, DC, Fahey wrote his first song at age 14. He headed west to Berkeley where his got his degree and then went into performing full time.

Like the other ""Guitar Artistry"" DVDs, this one serves two purposes: to inform and entertain non-musicians like myself and to educate those who play guitar. The camera work is exceptional and the close-ups so sharp that you can often read the label inside the guitar! As a bonus, Grossman has included a 12-minute ""sample lesson"" as a bonus (along with another 13 minute interview with Fahey by Christian Roebling). And for a bonus to the bonus lesson the DVD contains a .pdf of the sheet music and tablature for the sample lesson.

All Fahey fans - both those who play and those who just listen -will want this DVD, even if you have other concert videos of him.

HIGHLY recommended!

8436871,5,B004NYYDVQ,"This DVD consists primarily of material which has been issued as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Fahey-In-Concert/dp/B00016XN0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Fahey - In Concert</a>&nbsp;and I was going to avoid it as merely a name change until I noticed extra songs, and interview and a running time reflecting additional material.

What we have is John Fahey's appearance from a tv show in 1969 and a concert filmed in 1996 ...along with a new set of performances and an interview which appear to be the most recent of the batch.  Unlike the first DVD which presented the programs as aired with interview segments and a concert they have sort of cobbled together a program which reflects the nature of this series..in which they film an artist and between songs he or she discusses their music. These ""guitar artistry"" series are not concerts but done in studio. So unlike the previous DVD which gives you the benefit of feeling like you are watching a concert and program this feels a bit choppy....but it does have extra songs and an extra interview and they are filmed very artistically and as a life long fan of Mr Fahey they are so welcome that I'm happy to have both DVDs and am not bothered by the duplication. I also think that there is some interview footage from '69 missing on this collection so rabid fans like myself will be happy to own both.

There is also a bonus guitar lesson thrown in from one of the series that were filmed in the mid 90's as well.

If you are unfamiliar with John Fahey, I can't say I'd recommend starting here as your first choice..I believe his music would be where I would recommend you going and some highlights are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-John-Fahey-1959-1977/dp/B00006LI3B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of John Fahey 1959-1977</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-Of-The-Repressed-The-Anthology/dp/B0000033C2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return Of The Repressed: The Anthology</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Of-Rivers-Religion-After-Bail/dp/B00008Z1T7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Of Rivers & Religion / After Bail</a>

John Fahey means so much to guitar players and music fans around the world that get him and enjoy his music ....he can be an acquired taste for others but that can be said for most artists and he truly is an artist.  There is over 2 hours of pure musical genius....I can't see rating it less than 5 stars.",1303344000,6,2570,5.895161290322581
