7891095,1,6305502676,"Badly photographed, badly scripted, badly edited, badly directed--this  sensationalist exploitation of young Jeff Bridges is interesting mainly to see what extents of humiliation Burgess Meredith will subject Jeff to.  So jaw-droppingly bad, I watched it through to the end when it was shown on TV, but definitely not worth the cost of postage.",1160956800,2,344,5.471698113207547
7891096,2,6305502676,"The 1936 movie is much better than the 1971 Yin and Yang of Mr. Go... In fact, that one is so bad that I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen that was not part of a MST3K collection. Jeff Bridges as a hustling Army deserter in Hong Kong; Burgess Meredith as a Chinese acupuncturist; James Mason as a Mexican-Chinese superspy who turns ""good"" when the Buddha shines his third eye on him to make him do a 180 from his evil ways; catfights and topless Chinese girls....if you want to see a really corny movie, Mr. Go is the one to catch!",1137542400,6,539,4.1923076923076925
7891097,5,6305502676,"This is a one of a kind film.  The special effects are poor by post WWII standards,  but then again there are a lot of lousy films with amazing special effects.  The story involves an American draft dodger and aspiring writer named Nero Finnigan (played by a young Jeff Bridges) who becomes involved with the notorious Mr. Go, an oriental organized crime mastermind.  They conspire to blackmail an American weapons scientist into providing secrets to Mr. Go's organization for resale to the highest bidder.  Enter ""the Dolphin"", an American CIA agent and James Joyce scholar, tasked with recovering the scientist and his work by whatever means necessary. Through the intervetion of the spirit of Bhudda, one of the characters will undergo ""Transmutation"" which results in a totally unpredictable change of life.  The ending of the film is equally unpredictable, even as late as five minutes from the end.
  This film could be described as ""campy"" or a ""cult masterpiece"" , but in truth it defies classification. If you are bored by traditional hollywood movies, if you like films like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", or go bonkers over spaghetti westerns and kung fu movies, give this ""closet classic"" a shot.  I can safely say you will love it or hate it. The music is late '60s pop/jazz/hip theatrical, and will appeal to those with a suitably perverse aesthetic sensibility. I love it, and keep a sealed spare copy, since availability is sporadic.  Enjoy!",1012953600,7,1459,4.967078189300412
7891098,1,6305502676,"This movie is so bad it is entertaining. In fact, this movie is just begging for the MST3K treatment.
It features Burgess Meredith as a Chinese pharmacist, James Mason as a Chinese/Mexican criminal of some sort, and Jeff Bridges as a draft dodger hanging out in Hong Kong.  It also features a seven foot Chinese actor and a monkey. The plot has to do with stealing US weapons secrets -- not that it matters. The special effects and dialog are laugh out loud bad. The soundtrack will make you want to shove pencils through your eardrums.
Check out Meredith's biography to see what he had to say about this film.",1009497600,2,610,4.545454545454546
7891099,4,6305502676,"James Mason gives an excellent performance as Mr. Go in this strange little tale.  I can't think of another film that quite comes across as not intended for general viewing as Mr. Go, in spite of some good work by the cast.  I enjoyed it, but that's me.  I especially enjoyed the scenes with Broderick Crawford and Robert Shayne, which were apparently added later, Crawford referring to China as ""the jolly red giant"" at one point.",984614400,2,431,4.644736842105263
