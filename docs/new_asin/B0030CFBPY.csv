8385694,4,B0030CFBPY,"I've always loved the movie Princess Bride. It's a classic! So when I decided to buy it on Blu Ray, I was surprised how hard it was to find it. Amazon offered it with the movie ""Marley and Me"", so I bought it. Even though Marley & Me is about as silly as it gets imo, it's still worth the extra money to have ""Princess Bride"" in my Blu Ray collection.",1396396800,,351,3.9577464788732395
