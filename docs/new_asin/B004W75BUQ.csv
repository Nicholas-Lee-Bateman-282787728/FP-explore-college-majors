8444576,5,B004W75BUQ,I watched these during the original run and purchased it to show to kids in therapeutic groups. These young voices give me hope for our future because they are expressing hopes and dreams and their voices speak truth. And I'm a 61 yo grandmother!,1372291200,,246,4.613636363636363

I actually did cry while watching some of the poems, which is always a good sign. Poetry should move you in some way.

Definitely a must-watch for all poetry-heads like me, along with all other creative writers! :)",1357430400,,327,4.719298245614035
8444578,5,B004W75BUQ,"I think I ordered the 2009 DVD of Brave New Voices--Hawaii won. Friday is poetry day in my class.  I was reading poetry written by teenage boys, and decided to supplement and change up from reading to switching between the two editions that I possess.  My kids are so fired up, I may have to start a club next year...No I do not spit, but am very confident I can help some rising stars make their mark in performance ""spoken word.""  It is sad at times to see how the issues of life impact young people, but I'm certain the healing that occurs through this media is worth the pain of the experience.  Keep it coming!!!",1336176000,,617,4.293103448275862
