This movie is a classic and should be on the shelves of any video  collector.  It's now on mine!",968889600,3,252,4.391304347826087
243785,5,6300215555,"I can still remember the night, roughly 20 years ago, that I first saw We're No Angels.  I was in college and about to watch my very first  ""late, late movie.""  It was, of course, We're No Angels, and even  though I own it on tape, I make a point of watching it whenever it shows up  on television or cable - no matter the time of day (or night).
Before  We're No Angels, I'd never even heard of Aldo Ray, but he, along with  Humphrey Bogart (who knew? and Peter Ustinov at their comedic bests  captured my heart with their performances in this wryly funny and strangely  sentimental movie about three cons on the loose on Devil's Island, trying  to make their way off the island and back into civilization.
After they  escape the prison, they find refuge with a French family who owns a sort of  general store.  With plans to steal them blind, they end up involved with  the family's various predicaments, including the love life of the daughter  of the store-owner, with blackly humorous results.
Bogarts' character  is clearly the brains of the group, with Ustinov's providing wry commentary  and Ray's being the big-hearted lug.
Though the movie bears no  resemblance at all to the horrible life that existed in the prisons of  French Guiana, this is delightful romp that manages to be heart-warming and  dry at the same time.  Set during Christmas, this movie works well  year-round, and I strongly recommend it.

243786,5,6300215555,"As a stoned Bogie fan, this is a do not miss movie. It has become a family Christmas time tradition along with the other standards (Christmas Carol, Mircle on 34th Street, etc..) Joseph, Jules, Albert and Adolph while  claiming to be no angels are at the very least, three wise men and a very  discriminating serpent.",957484800,3,317,4.642857142857143
243787,5,6300215555,"While the subtlety of the film may evade some, Bogart is a classic intellectual comedian; the rest of the cast is perfect for the performance needed. This is not a Christmas movie, it's a movie about people.  Bogart,  Ustinov, and company helping an honest man LOOK like an honest man; Basil  Rathbone is as despicably evil as any classic villian, and the story is  simple, direct, and lovable.",954633600,,394,4.75
243788,1,6300215555,"It's hard to believe such a ""classic"" had evaded me for all these years, until last night. Would it have evaded me forever. What is this, a Christmas special written for the Three Stooges by a very drunk  Noel Coward? Bogie, phoning in his lines, does not make for good cinema.  The totally cheesy set? Don't get me started. And as to the cavalier murder  of the two antagonists, this is for the kiddies? Don't like the baddies,  sic a poisonous snake on 'em? Bah humbug, at least Dickens had the complex  idea of reforming Scrooge. Glib stupidity.",952732800,2,548,4.551020408163265

I hated the idea of watching a movie first of all that was in black  and white but was about 178 years old. But after sitting down and watching  it I was amazed at the comedy style of this threesome.

When our family stumbled upon this holiday movie, it instantly joined the beloved ranks of  ""It's a Wonderful Life!"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  It's a delightful film with wonderful acting, one we should all see more  often.  This movie is hard to find in video stores and libraries-- but it  is well-worth the search.  I'd suggest you purchase your own copy and  spread the tradition.  I'm going to!",945907200,10,522,4.775280898876405
243791,5,6300215555,"I had the good fortune of catching this film on AMC the other night, and almost laughed myself straight into a coma before I finished it. Staring Humphery Bogart, Basil Rathborne and another gentleman, this is a sheer  masterpiece of wit and sarcasm, as well as a often touching story of three  Devil's Island Prison escapees who are stranded with a small family while  attempting to get off the island. The movie contains no sick, graphic jokes  so common today, but subtle phrases, quips and gentle barbs that leave you  rolling with laughter. The real jewel of the movie is Basil Rathborne, who  portrays a witty Englishman who provides most of the entertainment. You may  reagrd this as a Christmas movie if you wish, though it is really a movie  for all occasions. Immensely enjoyable, full of comedy, ""We're No  Angels"" is a treat to enjoy.",929059200,6,846,4.739726027397261
243792,5,6300215555,"So much better than the remake, they should be embarrassed to even attempt it. This movie is timeless and can be enjoyed over and over. Even with the Christmas theme, it's message of the basic decency of your fellow man,  regardless of the mistakes he might have made, is uplifting (and funny!)  Good actors, good characters, good story and dialogue. Versions on tv don't  do it justice, cut up for ads and scenes cut to fit timeframe.",914025600,2,435,4.623376623376624

243847,5,6300215555,"in advance please forgive my spelling Harvey destroyed my home  all my computers are gone and all I have is my smartphone so please be patient with me this is a no relation any kind of modern movie this is a Humphrey Bogart movie just to put it in its class and place I ran across this movie on on Turner Classic Movies the first time I saw it there I decided that I needed to own it so I've been on the lookout for it ever since it popped up on Amazon about 3-4 months ago and I looked at it and I passed on it and I looked at it and I passed on it and when I noticed that it was an add-on for $4.95 I jumped on it it arrived on time i n t a c t along with one other title that I ordered I decided to watch this one the first please let me say what kept me from ordering We're No Angels was hoping that somebody would put it on Blu-ray. Blu-ray has a nasty habit of missing some of the best movies and putting nonsense in release like Ernest Goes to Camp and while I have nothing against that movie it's certainly not high enough caliber to consider a release on Blu-ray no offense if you're a fan, still waiting for War of the Worlds to show up on Blu-ray or this island Earth those sorts of Classics are certainly worth putting on Blu-ray enough about that this movie the picture quality first let me tell you is the best picture quality I've seen on a DVD it is just excellent detail color balance and Lighting perfectly done just take for instance there's a lot of canvas and burlap bags in this movie  noticing on the edges you can see the individual threads fraying detail uncharacteristic of any DVD  just very very very clean. The most devout of audio and video file will be very pleased with this movie no it is not stereo or surround sound at all but it is Dolby Digital and it is clean so very very clean no scratches no hissing or pops like it has been remastered but nowhere on the package does it say it has been but it must have but this is a very old movie some attention has been paid I guarantee it because it's just too clean to have been a simple film transfer someone did some cleanup secondly let me tell you this movie was produced in color it is Paramount production and so it was released in color Paramount didn't do much black and white they didn't release the kind of movie that they didn't expect to make money like Warner did so much I don't know how it did at the box office but I can tell you this movie will make you laugh touch your heart and just make you feel good it is so funny the set on Devil's Island using a lot of stage mats and they're not really all that well done but but please believe me you won't mind and it won't matter with the stars that are in this movie such as Humphrey Bogart Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray just for starts that's enough right there full stop,, and yet they're even more stars in this movie like the Sherlock Holmes character Basil Rathbone Rathbone in a role that he doesn't usually play a grasping scrooge-like character that well I could tell you but that would be a spoilers so I won't say anything else let's just say that you'll be satisfied with this movie from beginning to end if you're a Humphrey Bogart fan this is a must because you'll get to see bogey sing and he doesn't do too bad a job of it although I wouldn't ask him to quit his day job this is an excellent movie if you like Bogart and oh by the way it's set at Christmas time in the 1800's long before consumerism was a thing the way they treated Christmas is something we can all take a lesson from The Joy was pure and unadulterated but that doesn't mean this is strictly a Christmas movie you can watch it the the year round I do I've already seen it twice and I intend to see it again soon it's just that kind of movie a guilty pleasure has Robert Osborne used to say rest his soul thank you for taking the time to read the review I hope it helps one more thing I intend to enter a copy of a picture that I took directly from my television I certify and promise I make no edits to the picture whatsoever it is what I took off my television these transfers tend to be a little blue heavy but the movie is not so please don't judge it in that way strictly watch it on the luminance quality please color balance is a little off but only in my picture not on the transfer",1520726400,2,4312,4.05868544600939

243929,5,6300215555,"A charming & heartwarming tale set at Christmastime in the 1800's on Devil's Island.  Three convicts, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov & Aldo Ray have escaped from the prison & are among the townpeople while they are plotting their escape.  Well, they end up at the shop of a bit of a bumbling shopkeeper, played to perfection by Leo G. Carroll (he of the ""Topper"" series!), his wife, played by Joan Bennett (some may be familiar with her as the family matriarch of Dark Shadows) and their daughter.  It IS in color & not that colorization done to some original black & white movies.  This 1955 original movie is NOT the same movie as the 1989 ""We're No Angels"" with Robert Deniro & Sean Penn (0 stars; a dud).  My family & I have been watching this for Christmas as long as I can remember, beginning with VHS &  just finally upgraded to the DVD in time for viewing this Christmas.

All kinds of merriment ensues, as the ""three wise men"" (the convicts) become embroiled in the family's life, since the daughter is in love with a young man who is as arrogant & snide as his Uncle, Cousin Andre, who owns the shop & treats his cousin with contempt that he is not ruthless enough with customers to be making a profit for him.  The convicts set about to fix the roof, sell customers items they don't need, or fit properly & insist on payment for such goods!  They also prepare a glorious Christmas for the family Ducotel, complete with a sumptious turkey dinner (said turkey being stolen from the mayor's, as well as the Christmas Tree)!!  They set tables outdoors & serenade the family.  While this is occurring, Cousin Andre arrives & wants to go over the ""books""/accounting, which sets Leo G. Carroll & the family in a tizzy.  No problem for the convicts who each have their own set of skills, and a beloved poisonous pet snake...who so happens to escape & land in the guest quarters of Cousin Andre & his equally mean nephew.

When an officer from the navy comes to the shop, the convicts push he & the daughter together, tying up all loose ends!!!  And, the three wise men, these three friends decide as they are looking out at the harbor & the ship they'd need to catch to escape, they realize their lives on Devil's Island really aren't so bad after all, since they've got each others' friendship & can escape the prison & do it again next Christmas!!!  And, with that the closing scene is as memorable & ingrained in my memory as one of the most touching (& cute) of any I've ever seen!!  A precious and heartwarming movie that's sure to please every family member, from age 5 to 95!!",1514851200,,2586,4.470212765957447

The story may not be unique but the way they play it out is both cute and funny.

Some annuals (Christmas season) wear out in time. This is one of those. However it does not distract from the first few times of viewing.

I can imagine it wasn't a smash hit in its day because it was considered shocking.  Which says a lot about the civility of the day...and the fact that this really isn't a Christmas movie, although that's the time of year in which it's set.

The transfer is absolutely as good as for White Christmas, which is another VistaVision movie made in the same era.

For instance, in the ""Christmas dinner"" scene where the convicts decorate the store for the holidays, the red and green decorations look truly beautiful and the colors look rich and bright.  None of the old 16 mm TV showings or VHS versions ever looked like this.

For those of you who don't know that this is a unique Christmas picture (set a century ago Down Under where it's 100 degrees at Christmas), give it a try.

There are times when the plot jerks around as if writer and director had trouble deciding what to do and just put filler to keep it going.

245302,5,6300215555,"Bottom Line: Were No Angels is a droll low key fun answer to too many treacly or product pushing Christmas movies. If there is a miracle of Christmas it is in how you react to the line: the Christmas turkey followed me home against my will.  Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, Aldo Ray under play their roles as murderous escaped convicts and thereby provide a merry light movie time escapade. There are no bad words or naughty shows of skin to keep away the younguns but more delicately minded parents may want to think about the incidental passing of the heavies, and an atypical attitude towards private property and salesmanship. In the immortal words of Sen. Claghorn or more recently Foghorn Leghorn: its a joke son. Relax and enjoy it.
'''''

This is for me an almost perfect Christmas movie. Light as air, with a brilliantly written script and the emphasis on dry humor. If you are looking for overt religious content or didactic moral lessons those are elsewhere. There are traditional values here, but all with a slight twist. This movie has a simple purpose- to entertain. Pushing the limits a tad, there is a literal snake in this Devils Island version of the Garden of Eden.

  Angels takes us to the civilian side of the French penal colony on Devils Island. Here the local shop owners, the Ducotels lead by Leo G. Carroll are well meaning innocents. Thus far they are usually the victims of their customers and now they become the unintentional hosts of three escaping convicts. The three had intended to rob and murder their hosts, but instead become charmed by the willingness of these people to treat them decently.

As the three multi-talented criminals get drawn deeper into the lives of the innocents they assume a guardianship of their hosts that will include everything from turning the tables on hard to please and rarely paying customers, to providing Christmas with all the trimming, including the aforesaid wandering turkey and ultimately the marriage plans of their daughter. It is in the contrast between the hard and cynical criminals and their worldly solutions and the bland innocence of their hosts that make the heart of this comedic situation.

Virtually all of the humor derives from the interplay between Bogie, Ustinov and Ray.  The rest of the cast is their straight men. An ongoing physical joke is how the three physically intimidate, facilitate or stand in relation to other characters. Movie heavy Basil Rathbone will never pass through a door without having to maneuver around one or more of the 3. Spoken humor often derives from what we know a convict to mean as opposed to what he says.

The center piece of the humor revolves around a brilliantly staged discussion about who among the 3 should warn Monsieur Trochard (Rathbone) about a potentially deadly situation into which he has placed himself. At the risk of a spoiler it is not by direct action by these three that any other person finds themselves in danger. One of the very few negative reviewers would have you believe otherwise.

As of this writing the likes for Were No Angels are 10 to 1 in favor. Of the less than 60 unhappy reviewers some experienced technical problems. My copy played with no problems. Color and audio quality was more than satisfactory. I am in region 1. This is a review of the DVD copy.",1451779200,8,3316,4.781468531468532

Great cast, especially Humphrey Bogart, a young Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray as three roguish escapees from Devils Island who set out to rob a hapless and naive family only to realize the family is in desperate need of their help. You could say they're stand-ins for the Three Wise Men who come bearing unusual gifts. The familys store is deeply in debt and they have nothing to look forward to on Christmas day except eviction by their arrogant and heartless relative who owns the store.  The three rogues decorate a makeshift Christmas tree, wrap gifts and prepare a festive holiday dinner for the family (from money theyve swindled from customers).  They out-maneuver and outsmart the evil relative (Basil Rathbone) who makes the fatal mistake of stealing their beloved pet, a poisonous snake.

245886,5,6300215555,"What a wonderful movie!  The plot revolves around three escaped convicts, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray, who in trying to escape from Devil's Island, end up aiding a hapless shop owner (Leo G. Carroll) and his family.  If you thought Humphrey Bogart couldn't do comedy, then you should see this movie!  The humor is in the form of dry wit presented by the three main characters.  It reminds me in a way of the interaction seen on ""Newhart;""  great humor but quiet and oh so funny.  As another reviewer posted, the humor has just enough of a dark edge so that it never falls into sappiness. This is a movie to relieve the sorry mess of newer presentations:  there is no glitz, no computer graphics, just good solid acting and storyline.  It has the look and feel of a stage presentation but that serves to make it all the better as it brings your focus into the story itself.  The jury was out:  my husband wasn't sure about this when we put it in the DVD player to watch yet he was the one who laughed the hardest!

Their adventures and redemption among the hapless Ducotel family make for a charming tale.  Fine ensemble acting from Bogard Ray and Ustinov and Bogie gets to show his tongue in cheek humorous side.

246133,5,6300215555,"This has to be one of the most charming black comedies ever made.  WE'RE NO ANGELS (1955) takes place in the French colony off Devil's Island, in 1895.  Three escaped prisoners (Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray) hole up in the gift shop of a local merchant and wife (Leo G. Carroll, Joan Bennett), and perform minor and then major services in fixing up the house and fixing up the owners' lives, including that of their pretty daughter (Gloria Talbott).  Complications arise when the owners' cousin and financial overseer (an aging Basil Rathbone) shows up at a particularly awkward time, and incurs the wrath of the prisoners' unseen but eventful pet ""Adolph.""  A little slow-paced at times in that Fifties way.  Of the three leads, Bogie was never a natural at light comedy, but had improved somewhat since his outing in the cult film BEAT THE DEVIL the year before.  Ustinov plays his role as a coy assembly of tics and gestures, effectively soloing in tandem more than playing to ensemble.  Really the most effective of the leads are hunky Aldo Ray, who projects the air of cheerful amoralism this movie requires; and Leo G. Carroll as family head, whose befuddled reactions add much credibility.  The Christmas setting is lovely, and the current price puts this holiday offering in the ""stocking stuffer"" category.  Several Amazon reviewers recommended this flick on a recent discussion forum and I'm glad they did!",1416700800,5,1432,4.933333333333334

246172,3,6300215555,"What gives? What gives, just to give a snapshot of what this film is about, is that Bogie is one of three hardened convicts (the other two played Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray), French convicts, hard cases all (murderers, career criminals) who are doing hard time at that little maximum prison resort in the Caribbean, Devils Island. But being resourceful, especially around Christmas time, they escaped to the town nearby with plans to set sail for France and to take up their old lives as carefree guys once again, maybe a heist here, a con there, simple stuff. But first they need dough, plenty of dough, and some new duds since to grab that departing ship requires not just dough but a certain look, a look like you did not just escape from high security Devils Island.  So they planned to rob a clothing merchant to give them that cash, and throw in the duds while they were at it. Turned out though, as the film slowly developed, the merchant was no good as a businessman having failed in France and been sent out to the boondocks by his greedy rich cousin, a nefarious relative as it turned out, no question, had a wife, a fetching wife, no question, who stood by him (they don't always, the fetching ones), and a sweet teenage daughter, all betwixt and between, who was in love with, well, you know how teenagers are, in love with being in love.

So our hardened criminals, our nefarious bad guys slowly turned things around and went from attempted robberies and petty pilfering of civilian outfits to Good Samaritans and help the merchant (by getting rid of, getting rid in a very final way, the greedy cousin who had come from France for an inspection), the wife (still standing by her husband to Bogies chagrin), and that smitten daughter (who fell in and out of love with one guy, and then in love with another, like I said a typical teenager) being witty, ironic, and funny by turns, especially Bogie. And get this, once they have spread their Christmas cheer they head back to jail, no, head back to hellhole Devils Island. What the heck is going on with our man Bogie. Give me Duke Mantee who would just as soon put a slug in a guy as look at him (and does in that endless cinematic battle between the primitive instincts of man and the modern attempts to curb those baser instincts which got a thorough-going test in the real world of the 1930s and 1940s) or Sam Spade who turned over, once he took a cold shower to wipe that come hither look out of his mind and opened a window to let the city air merge and melt that jasmine scent, that filled with the stuff of dreams femme fatale who just so happened to have an itchy trigger-finger to the coppers without a tear. Give me that Rick of Ricks Caf who gave up his honey, without or without the jasmine scent as a lure that was just the way it was with them, for the good of the cause or that made of sterner stuff skirt-chasing Captain Morgan once he saw she could sing too, sing and take a few knocks without crying about the matter. Okay, and give me that handy Philip Marlowe, avenger of sullen womens sicknesses, avenger of old mens broken dreams, avenger of wrong track turned right femmes, avenger of small time right gees and grifters by bad hombres who put paid to the career of one Eddie Mars or the stick to his guns, undeterred, inquisitive, and vengeful Rip not leaving his Army buddy behind, or anything to sullen his memory. sullen.

Admittedly, I am a traditionalist - so -  if you like modern movies' with sex and bedroom romps, blood and guts flying, explosions and graphic fights,  or primping and posing actors that deliver small amounts of simple dialogue between these things, you will hate this movie.  It will be the most boring thing you ever watched and you will turn it off one quarter of the way through if not sooner.  On the other hand, if you like wry and subtle humor, witty dialogue, snappy banter that it takes a few brain cells to follow, and acting that is real acting - then you will like this movie.

WE'RE NO ANGELS is a PARAMOUNT picture that was directed by Michael Curtiz. In this Xmas season black comedy adapted by Ranald MacDougall from Albert Husson's stageplay ""La Cuisine de Anges,"" three Devil's Island prison escapees lay low at a local home, where they get involved in the problems of a family they'd intended to rob and murder.

The film is episodic at first and drags in spots, but when villainous Rathbone and his repulsive son Baer arrive, things kick into high gear, and they soon kick buckets. Bogey (as Joseph) is surprisingly good playing it for laughs. A little black and red striped snake (that we never see) steals the show.

Screenwriter MacDougall, who in the early 1970s was President of the Writers Guild of America (west), also scripted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MILDRED-PIERCE/dp/6301973410/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MILDRED PIERCE</a>&nbsp;(1945), Hitchcock's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STAGE-FRIGHT/dp/6300270386/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STAGE FRIGHT</a>&nbsp;(1950) and MR.

While waiting to get out to the boats, they happen upon a store owner's family and the hijinks ensue.  Many, many big name stars in this one.

I wouldn't have thought they would work well together, but they did.  Sprinkled into the cast are lots of ""old Timer"" character
actors....Leo G. Carroll, Basil Rathbone, and Joan Bennett, for instance.  There is also a very young, and handsome, John Smith (in one of his early roles).  Though the story is implausible...the idea that 3 convicts escape...aren't  captured, and move about freely in front of everyone is rather hard to take.  Their intent was to get off of the small island and get to freedom...somewhere along the way
they lose track of this.  Therein lies the story.  They set about straightening out everyone's lives....with the help of Adolph, the
snake (we never see Adolph, but he is present ....just not seen).  How everything falls into place is comical....things can be slow-
moving...it does take time for things to happen...one has to be patient.
Now, I don't think Bogart ever cracks a smile....or Ustinov raises his voice in any way.  The 3 are always soft-spoken, polite, and calculating.  They commit murder in the nicest way....think Adolph!  And the best line in the movie is......Aldo Ray looking at John
Smith in his Clorox white and tidy naval uniform and declaring, ""He looks like a glass of milk""!  Well, see it and laugh!

I would not call this a christmas movie, but it does take place during and around xmas, and if I had to pick a movie to watch that had ""holiday spirit"" this would be the one. Of course it's also my favorite devil's island prison movie.

In terms of acting: Bogart is craggy and comedy is not his forte. Aldo Ray is cute, funny, sweet, and dashing. Peter Ustinov is just a brilliant and convincing actor with a cuddly sweet portrayal of his character Jules. Basil Rathbone is over the top evil.

Leo G. Carroll as Felix Ducotel. It is a wonderful cast thrown together with a promising script,but the understated acting undermines the entire picture and it generates little to no energy.
The story opens on Christmas Eve,1895,on infamous Devil's Island. There is a pronounced fork in a dirt road;from one direction comes a cart and its driver,and from the other,three men in a hurry from the direction of the prison. Bogie,Ray and Ustinov are three convicts who want to get off Devil's Island via a ship that has just anchored off shore. The three come upon a shop run by Carroll and his wife Bennett. Carroll isn't the best businessman and the three start by rifling through his shop goods even before he arrives at the front to greet them. Conversation reveals that the roof leaks and Bogie volunteers the group to go up and fix the roof. The three's real intention is to steal him blind,kill the family and leave the island. However as time goes by and they are introduced to each family member,the three become attached to them and ultimately befriend them and help them. The three pilfer many things around the island to make the family a memorable Christmas Eve meal,and Carroll even pays them for their trouble. They're very touched and cannot go through with their original plans.
Into the mix comes Carroll's boss/cousin,Rathbone and his nephew. Rathbone is in a foul mood and has nothing but contempt for the three outsiders. He wants to work Christmas Day with Carroll,taking inventory. The three now have their new victim. To top this Rathbone's nephew,who some time before promised to marry Carroll's daughter,has reneged. As the three stand around wondering what to do next,Rathbone comes in and takes a little wooden cage Ray always carries with him. In it is a deadly viper snake,but Rathbone confiscates it thinking it is property they stole,and takes it back into his room. When they finally settle on just who should tell him what is in the box,the snake has already done its work and Rathbone is dead. Bogie plants a phony will inside Rathbone's suitcase leaving his fortune to Carroll and his family. However the nephew finds it and burns it. When the nephew goes back in to rifle through his uncle's pockets,the viper bites him and he is soon gone also.
A good looking medical officer arrives at the house(having heard about a death there)and the three play cupid for Carroll's daughter. They finally decide maybe prison wasn't such a bad place after all,and nattily dressed,depart for their former prison digs,halo's appearing over them all,including the snake.
Director Curtiz's direction was really tepid on this one,as I found everything about the film understated. This resulted in a staid and monotone-like dynamic that failed to generate any excitement or apathy for the hijinks on the screen. Rathbone made a good part of his acting career playing wonderful snobs,and he is the bright light amongst the dull here.
Technically this is a crisp and clear print of the film in a w/s a/r of 1:85:1. There are no extras at all.

Bogart is spot on with his comedic performance; Ustinov, a highly talented actor, is so funny; and Ray is a tough guy, skirt-chaser with a  'big brother' heart. While the plot takes place at Christmas, this film can be watched at any time during the year. However, I do wish more people will demand that 'We're No Angels' makes the standard Christmas films list that shows on television every year. It belongs in the same class with 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Buy this film! You certainly won't regret it.",1376697600,,832,4.659863945578231

Two convicted murderers and a con-man have their own style of helping out.  A very young looking Peter Ustinov co-stars in this.  And Bogart is, well... he's Bogart.

Great story, excellent humor and a wonderful message.

To say we were impressed by the quality of the DVD is an understatement. We were blown away. My 13 year old said ""Dad, it looks like they filmed it yesterday!"" The color was amazing and the detail that you could see was impressive. One of the convicts had tattoos on his arms... that we knew. But now we can actually see what they are and the detail. Granted... our old VHS tape must have deteriorated over time... but still it was a joy to be able to see it again with such vivid color and sharpness. This was just awesome for us.

The cast is amazing--Leo G. Carrol, Basil Rathbone,etc. but the standouts were Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray. In a cute story line about escaped convicts who encounter a very nice family in dire straights at Christmastime, the weakest link is actually Bogart. Aldo Ray (highly underrated--I can't figure out why he wasn't a huge star) is marvelous as a womanizer with a heart and Peter Ustinov is fantastic in pretty much everything: every word he utters is perfect and just standing in the background of a scene, he was interesting. The story telling is calmly paced and scripted with snappy, fast-moving detail while taking its time getting where it's going. I can't really describe it, it's so odd--suffice to say, it's a nice alternative to the usual films you watch at Christmas.

If you can imagine Bogart in a comedy, a Christmas comedy, then you have a better imagination than I do.  The first time I watched this film, I couldn't believe how good it is and that I had never heard of it.  Most probably, it has been overlooked and ignored because it received mixed reviews from many high profile critics, Bogart made many classic films of greater merit, and this film is not worthy of his stature as one of Hollywood's kings.  Nevertheless, this is a funny, charming, Christmas film that will delight you in many ways.  The Angels, Bogart, Ustinov, and Ray, are splendid.  The supporting cast, beginning with Basil Rathbone, is perfect.  The story was originally written as a stage play and it shows in the direction.  Don't let that spoil your fun as it has for many nearsighted critics who are straining the gnat and swallowing the camel.  They low rate a picture because their popcorn was stale.

The DVD has very good sound, picture, and overall quality.  I watch my copy on a Blu-Ray player so production values may appear a little better than on a DVD player.  However, there are no significant flaws in the transfer to DVD, so relax and enjoy.  If you watch this film once, you will watch it a dozen times.

The problem I had with the Amazon advertised Region 1 version was twofold..  First, the price was over $63... Whoa! Give me a break.  Second, was how it was advertised.  It was listed as widescreen but in the Product Details, it gave an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 which I understand to be full screen.. It was confusing.

247548,5,6300215555,"The subtext of this movie is (initially) dark: the planned robbery and murders of an innocent family on Christmas eve by a trio of escaped convicts on a French colony island at the end of the 19th century. But actually, it's a hilarious comedy with several overlapping plots that evolve and complement each other superbly. The subtleties and timing of three convicts played by Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Aldo Ray are masterful. And Basil Rathbone oozes the self-absorbed evilness of a Victorian robber baron without the usual campiness and exaggeration.

Typical of the dialog among the three convicts:
Albert (Ray): ""If only they didn't trust us!""
Jules (Ustinov): ""It isn't fair. Here we are, three desperate criminals, who will stop at nothing to escape from Devil's Island, and we have to fall in with NICE people.""
Joseph (Bogart): ""You guys act like you don't want to cut their throats.""
Jules: ""Well, speaking for myself I'd just as soon not.""
Albert: ""After all, it might spoil their Christmas.""
Joseph: ""I don't care how nice they are, they're not going to soften me up. We're escaping, and this is our only chance. We came here to rob them and that's what we're gonna do -- beat their heads in, gouge their eyes out, cut their throats -- as soon as we wash the dishes.""

In this reviewer's opinion, it's the best Christmas movie ever made -- far superior to the usual assortment of A Christmas Carol remakes and the cliche ""It's a Wonderful Life.""",1307404800,,1466,4.790513833992095

247589,4,6300215555,"WE'RE NO ANGELS is a PARAMOUNT picture that was directed by Michael Curtiz. In this Xmas season black comedy adapted by Ranald MacDougall from Albert Husson's stageplay ""La Cuisine de Anges,"" three Devil's Island prison escapees lay low at a local home, where they get involved in the problems of a family they'd intended to rob and murder.

The film is episodic at first and drags in spots, but when villainous Rathbone and his repulsive son Baer arrive, things kick into high gear, and they soon kick buckets. Bogey (as Joseph) is surprisingly good playing it for laughs. A little black and red striped snake (that we never see) steals the show.

247596,4,6300215555,"We're No Angels has been synopsized repeatedly here & elsewhere, so I won't; I offer just a few random thoughts:

Any film that keeps the Christmas spirit without totally sugar-coating it deserves some respect, especially if it comes from the Hollywood studio system.  I could watch WNA's 10 consectutive times before I'd have any desire to see Miracle on 42nd Street or Wonderful Life again (and I'm a Capra fan).  That We're No Angels is also more than a little dark & cynical around the edges - including a perverse send-up of the Three Wise Men tradition - makes it even more remarkable(& delicious).

Although far from his best role, Bogie seemed to be enjoying himself in this rare comic outing, and especially seemed to enjoy poking fun at his more usual tough-guy persona.  Aldo Ray was similarly nicely cast against/not against type.  Peter Ustinov was his usual amusing self - droll, and dryly, cheerfully hammy, as only he could be.  Leo G. Carroll was Leo G. Carroll, virtually indistinguishable from Mr. Waverly (including appearance, even though The Man From Uncle was 10 years in the future).  Joan Bennett's best moment was voicing the film's one song in her husky alto voice, a song altogether too modern for 1899, but pretty nonetheless.  Gloria Talbott was perfect as the shy, virginal Isabelle, and seemed to relish the garden scene where she is suddenly an expert flirt with the feckless Paul, played by John Baer, a standard-issue handsome young blond hunk of the era; ditto for the Army Medical Officer who (presumbably)wins the hand of Isabelle post-credits.

The direction was flawed - choppy editing & plodding pace here & there (although I suspect the pacing was at least partly deliberate - in keeping the mostly bone-dry humor; and ditto for the spare use of background music). Gives the impression of production-line studio holiday fare, even though the story is decidedly non-typical.  Also very ""stagey,"" with probably 90% of it taking place in the Ducotel's store/lodgings, but I thought the few exterior town scenes near the small dock were very nicely done, with lots of convincing detail.

What really interests me is that this cheekily cynical film got made at all in the depths of McCarthyism (A Christmas film! Is nothing sacred?! I tell you we're on a greased slide to Godless Communism, yada-yada); and how it got made.  It's a fairly slight effort & doesn't seem to much interest the film historians, but I would be very interested to know what the initial reception was, both public & critical.  It seems so out of step with its Happy Days era.

So in spite of being slight & imperfect, this is one of my favorite films and is now, through the goodness of the BlockBuster Bargain Bin, in our permanent collection.  My joy would be complete if someone were to re-edit to smooth off some of the rough edges, and include some historical & critical commentary.",1269043200,3,2899,4.849898580121704

247663,3,6300215555,"After watching the 1989 version, I decided I needed the original. Honestly, I have no idea why they kept the title for the newer movie, because the two are not related at all. I'm one of the minority, in that I didn't like this one as well.

Three convicts on Devil's Island escape from the prison and decide to steal some supplies from a local shop before stowing away on a ship. Instead, they end up falling for the family who owns the shop, and helping them out.

It's a very cute movie, with the three being constantly pulled between their desire for escape and their growing affection for the family. And I did enjoy it, but it was really pretty simple and light, not really something I could sink my teeth into, I guess.

I suppose I fell into the same trap as those who disliked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-re-No-Angels/dp/B00015HX72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We're No Angels</a>&nbsp;(1989). I had the one I'd first seen in my mind, and expected something similar, so I was less than enthusiastic when I got something completely different. Whoever had the idea to give the second one the same title, I want to whack them over the head with my cluebat. It does both movies a disservice.

Something else that had me nonplussed: We're No Angels is based on the play My Three Angels, which I saw in a community theater nearly 20 years ago. I kept thinking I'd seen it--it was both familiar and not. Once my husband reminded me that we'd seen the play, the stage aspects were quite apparent--the movie was very nearly a filmed version of a play. A lot of the scenes were filmed from one angle on one set, and it was... tidy, the way plays are. One person talking at a time, for example.

And once I realized I'd seen the play, I also realized that I enjoyed the play more. The movie version didn't add anything for me. Sure, it was professional actors instead of amateurs, but I'm very fond of amateur theater. Making a movie from a play should be like making a movie from a book--there's no point unless you use the unique properties of film to add something to the adaptation.",1227139200,3,2132,4.720430107526882

Can they find passports and money? The convicts meet the shop owner, and we learn about them. Cayenne is hot and humid at Christmas, and the rest of the time. Will the daughter of the shopowner find true love and happiness? Will a letter bring shocking bad news? The story mixes comedy with drama.

Will nephew Paul take advantage of the new situation? Will he too have a disagreeable surprise? Will there be a happy ending? Was this film worth watching? Was this light-weight story padded out?

WE'RE NO ANGELS (1955) is a delicious black comedy, adapted by Ranald MacDougall from MY THREE ANGELS, a popular French play by Albert Husson, and directed by Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA).  In it, Bogart, Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray play three convicts who have escaped from the prison on Devil's Island on Christmas Eve.

While planning their departure from the island itself, they take refuge in a store run by a kind couple (Leo G. Carroll and Joan Bennett), who are being terrorized by Carroll's nasty uncle (Basil Rathbone), the store's owner.  Bogart and his two companions, with the help of their poisonous pet snake, decide to improve the couple's lives by seeing that ol' Basil and his equally villainous nephew don't bother them any longer.

It may have been produced in 1955 but it has stood time well, probably because it is set in the 19th century on a relatively obscure island.  The puns and deliberate pace of the comedy are classic.  There's a dark edge to the humor, but evil never really triumphs.  The film takes the old adage--God works in mysterious ways--and gives it a nice stretch.  Not to reveal the plot, let's just say it's a film about three tattered 'angels' attempting to flee Devil's Island penal colony who do a bit of good along the way.

By chance and a touch of larceny they end up in the shop of an honest family and are quickly disarmed. They try to keep up the external toughness but it only reveals their underlying goodness.

The fun really starts when the pennypinching owner of the store (Basil Rathbone of Sherlock Holmes fame!) arrives from France and wants a full accounting of the finances.  The three convicts take care of him but good!  This is partly a light-hearted romantic comedy and partly a Christmas story.  The dialogue and interplay between the three main actors is outstanding.

248042,5,6300215555,This is a great movie and I don't understand why it's not in one of Bogey's collections yet. It's a wonderful Xmas movie and deserves to be available on DVD ASAP! Somebody better take notice and do something so more people can share in this funny and warm gem of a film from 1955.,1117929600,4,280,4.203703703703703
248043,5,6300215555,"This movie deserves to be released on DVD. It has been one of my favorite movies which can be watched an endless number of times.

It shows Humphrey Bogart in a very amusing role, especially the scene where he sells a comb and a jacket that doesn't fit to a bald headed overweight man. Nigel Rathbone is very good in his role as the conniving owner of the store. Ustinov and Aldo Ray add their charm and wit to it enhancing the movie.

I loved every minute of it.

Please, please can you release this on DVD.",1114300800,4,508,4.216494845360825
248044,5,6300215555,"This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. When we were kids my sister and I would watch this every Christmas Eve. I really like this movie better than ""It's a Wonderful Life."" We're No Angels has a bit of an edge, and it emphasizes an important message. Everyone, no matter what they have done, or how they are viewed by society, is capable of goodness. This is a really great movie, and I miss seeing it every year.

Just a Note: There was a movie released in 1989 with Sean Penn and Robert DeNero that shares the title, but not the plot. In that movie two escaped convicts end up in a convent. I like it, too, but I think the 1955 We're No Angels about the three convicts who escape from Devil's Island and help the family who owns the General Store is better by far.",1105747200,13,776,4.208053691275167

248046,5,6300215555,"""We're No Angels"", has been a personal Christams classic of mine since I was 6 years old.

Where I lived, the local TV station programmer had enough insight to make this a yearly supplement, along with the traditional classics such as 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Rudolf'the Red-Nosed Reindeer'.

There's no denying the appeal of this movie, Christmas or otherwise, and there's enough positive praise of the film on this site to merit a DVD release, so PLEASE grant us this Christmas wish!",1103155200,34,489,4.879518072289157
248117,5,6300215555,"My mom watched this movie when she was a kid and showed it to me when I was a kid.  I really didn't care to watch black and white movies back then.  I didn't even know who Humphrey Bogart was nor did I care.  However, this movie is classic.  I believe I am a sucker for a movie that happens in one or two days like this one.  The comedy, plot, and acting are all great.  It is a good Christmas movie for the whole family.

The story is about escape cons who grow soft hearts when they try to rob a salt-of-the-earth family then kill them on Christmas Eve.  I know, it sounds horrible, but they rarely mention killing.  It was filmed in 1955 after all.

I love this movie and I bet you will too!",1102982400,6,694,4.0

248121,5,6300215555,This is a true delight...with a rare but extraordinary comedic performance by Humphrey Bogart. An excellent movie by any standards. I sincerely hope this movie is released on DVD!!!,1091664000,8,181,5.275862068965517

248123,5,6300215555,"All you really have to say about this movie is that it is a must see film. The movie is not meant to be historical about Devils Island, it just takes place there. It is just meant to be a fun movie and it does that extremely well. A MUST SEE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS. Good watching!!",1085097600,2,277,3.8771929824561404

It does indeed cast a spell, as it almost doesn't occur to one that this warm-hearted Christmas tale involves multiple murders. Be that as it may, this is a great Christmastime film, worthy of being viewed and cherished every year.",1080518400,,385,4.848484848484849
248125,5,6300215555,"I've seen a lot of funny movies in my day, but ""We're No Angels"" is one of my absolute favorites.  A lot of the comedy movies have a few really funny scenes with a lot of empty space in between.  But this movie has clever little humorous things spread throughout the movie.  This movie gets funnier every time I see it because I notice more of the little things in the background that are hilarious.  For example: when Jules is acting like a distinguished attourney, he is wearing a tie but no shirt.  The plot is very entertaining and the characters are loveable (except, of course, for the villains).  The movie has its touching moments as well, and the song is very enjoyable also.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  I highly recommend ""We're No Angels,"" and I'm a teenager!",1079740800,3,786,4.524822695035461
248126,5,6300215555,"This is hands down, THE quintessential Christmas film of all time. As a matter of fact, this film is so delightful, I watch it TWICE a year.
Every July and every December, I watch ""We're No Angels"" because I find it helpful to remind myself that there are good people in this world. Angels come in all shapes and sizes, and sometimes they even come in stripes.
""We're No Angels"" - the ORIGINAL version - is far and away THE BEST Christmas movie ever. Heck, it's one of the BEST movies of all times, which is why I watch in July AND December!",1070150400,3,541,4.262135922330097
248217,5,6300215555,"I don't know who would not like this movie, the only drawback? There is none. This film is one of the funniest most under-rated movies I have ever seen and it is a winner for anyone. Besides having an all-star cast of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Ustinov, and Basil Rathbone it also stars favorites such as Joan Bennett, Leo. G. Carroll, and not so well know but equally excellent Aldo Ray. Rathbone vies with Carroll to steal the show, although Ustinov is a visibly brilliant in all of his scenes. The magic of this film is the excellent chemistry between Ray, Bogart, and Ustinov and the hilariously funny screenplay done by Ranald MacDougall. The script is hilarious and will keep you laughing even if you know all the lines. The plot also is great and a winner for not only Christmas time but year round. I don't know why the critics panned the movie; except that Bogart was continually typecast as the ""male lead"". He is surprisingly funny however making this movie one of his absolute best. I don't know what else to say except ""Watch it!!!""",1059782400,28,1041,4.602150537634409
248218,5,6300215555,"There is a whole Genere of movies about saintly convicts, or criminals who are more honest than the people around them (Oscar springs to mind)  They tend to be sappy and unbeliveable.  This one is not.
Of course most movies of this type don't boast a 5 star cast such as Bogart, Ray and Ustinov, not to mention the classic villian of Hollywood Rathborne.
Dark Shadows fans will see a younger and quite fetching (does anybody SAY fetching anymore?) Joan Bennett in an odd Christmas tale of redemption, three devil's Island convicts, a girl in love and a snake named Adolph who is the star of the show.
This movie is too good and too much fun to give away the plot in the review.  The remake can't compare.
The most fun you will ever have on Devil's Island",1047859200,10,754,4.410071942446043

248221,5,6300215555,"The film moves slowly, so I doubt many who came of age since MTV will have the patience to let this film do its work.  The humor is gentle and ironic (requiring some depth to appreciate), so I doubt that the video game generation will see any entertainment value in it.  The situation is unbelievable, so I doubt that the jaded devotees of ""reality"" programming will have the imagination to appreciate it.  But for those who understand fable, and for those who appreciate the coaxing of a subdued chuckle, and for those with the patience to allow a film time to work on their hearts, this is a wonderful film to own and to watch whenever you tire of the jaded view of life with which we are battered by contemporary entertainment.",1009756800,5,730,4.515151515151516
248222,5,6300215555,"Movie critics are not impressed with this movie.  We have to disagree with the so-called experts; this is a hilarious comedy.  Looking beyond the sentimental trappings, the strength of the film is the droll exchanges of the three convicts: Joseph (Humphrey Bogart), Jules (Peter Ustinov), and Albert (Aldo Ray). With their pet viper, Adolph, the trio saves the Ducotel family from financial ruin by using their criminal skills to foil the real villains.  Their interactions with the loving Ducotel family begin to soften their jaded view of humanity.  As things get emotional on Christmas Eve, observe the comic arrival, mock trial, and execution of evil Cousin Andre Trochard.  After Cousin Andre expires, the boys have trouble getting the body discovered by a ""legitimate"" person, another hilarious segment.  Veteran director Michael Curtiz deftly displays a fine flair for timing and stinging humor.  Bogie is good at deadpan delivery.  As a slick con man, note his ability to sell the bald-headed customer hairbrushes.  Peter Ustinov is funny as a polite sex-fiend and murderer.  He drools longingly over a hefty lady customer of the Ducotel store and recalls occasions by date of when he was happy.  Aldo Ray, another lady-killer, gives the innocent daughter, Isabelle (Gloria Talbott), amusing advice on seduction.  Basil Rathbone plays, well, a Basil Rathbone type as coldhearted Cousin Andre in a ridiculous tasseled nightcap.  Leo G. Carroll is lovable and befuddled as Felix.  Joan Bennett rounds out the cast as his attractive younger wife, Amelie.  The movie, based on a play, looks a little stiff and stagy in places.  Beyond this minor quibble, it's great fun. ;-)",1008028800,38,1678,5.205223880597015

248224,5,6300215555,"Along with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Bishop's Wife"", this is one of the three best Christmas movies ever made. In fact, this is one you'll want to watch year-round. This is one the entire family will enjoy (it's one of my 10-year-old's favorite films).

248225,5,6300215555,"Did you ever wonder if Humphrey Bogart could play something other than a tough guy? In this film he plays a delightful con man who with his three friends has just escaped from the prison on Devil's Island. He and his friends get the opportunity to see what the real world is like when they meet the family that runs the general store on Christmas Eve. They discover that everyone in prison isn't necessarily bad, and that some of the worst villians never see the inside of a prison.  This is one of those films that you can watch again and again.",991008000,3,546,4.352941176470588
248226,5,6300215555,"Every year around the holidays, I sit down with a cup of coffee, wrap an afghan around myself and fall under the spell of this film yet again.  It's the story of three convicts trying to escape Devil's Island at Christmas.  And in spite of their best (or worst)intentions to do in a struggling shopkeeper and his family and steal all their money, they end up celebrating the holidays as part of the family.
The casting is unexpected but quite wonderful, with tough guys Humphrey Bogart and Aldo Ray showing their comic sides.  Peter Ustinov rounds out the trio of crooks and murderers nicely, with his dry, self-effacing delivery.  Leo G. Carroll, Joan Bennett and Basil Rathbone all turn in wonderful performances on the law-abiding side of things.
We're No Angels is a film that never drifts into sappiness or sentimentality.  There's always a little edge to the comedy, a little darkness underlying the light, and that makes for delicious viewing.  It's a very human and humane comedy for people who don't want their holiday spoiled by too much sugar.  One caveat:  Do NOT mistake the remake for this film.  They're not the same by any stretch.",977616000,134,1147,4.781725888324873
