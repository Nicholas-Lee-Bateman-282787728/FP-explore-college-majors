6478989,4,B00LBGP5KW,"Good mixture of viewpoints, some happy some sad but all PLUR.

I wish the movie would have gone a bit more into the back end of the festival and the artists but was fairly balanced overall.

For a 3 year EDC Veteran this was a fun movie and recap of the life at EDC",1409702400,2,265,3.888888888888889

6478994,5,B00LBGP5KW,"It helped me with opening my eyes to rave culture and my life has not been the same since!

6479001,4,B00LBGP5KW,"I understand the film makers direction to have stories of real people who make the journey to Vegas, and I appreciated that.  I think that it needed some more footage of what the DJs did to get there and prepare for the show like the first EDC movie had however.  I also wish that it showed more of the culture and vibe that takes over Vegas and the Speedway for that weekend.  I look back at my video clips I shot while there and can understand that it is a difficult task to get all the shots because there is no retakes a few days later, and even just moving around the grounds can be difficult.  Some more music would have been nice later on in the movie.",1462320000,2,659,4.125

6479008,5,B00LBGP5KW,"I needed to see what exactly EDC is before actually heading out to experience it in person later this year, so I decided to see this documentary and it was absolutely beautiful. The meaning of what the event actually is and how you become one with everyone under the electric sky only makes me anticipate the date to come! June 19 2015!!!

6479010,5,B00LBGP5KW,"Never been to EDC or any other rave for that matter.  But I bought tickets for EDC Las Vegas this summer.  Can't wait.  This is an awesome movie to get you hyped up.  Some of the stories seemed slightly fabricated (the people they follow all end up in the front row, etc.), but if you just lose yourself in the experience, it's a great movie.  Great featured songs, too.",1425772800,2,370,4.304347826086956
6479011,2,B00LBGP5KW,"I expected to be blown away by this video. Of course, it's hard to capture the moments of absolute bliss that are experienced at the actual event, however I wanted to hope they would try. It was somewhat interesting to see how individuals/couples, etc. make the best of EDC, but maybe 10 minutes tops should be focused on that. I wanted to see more of the things I might have missed. The lights, the costumes, the people, the kandi, the totums, etc. I put the lights down, grabbed a bottle of wine and wanted to relive one of the most amazing weekends of my life. Instead, I was confused. I only kept watching because I was waiting for something great to happen. The video did not clearly depict the festival and all its glory. I was let down.",1424304000,2,743,4.391304347826087

6479019,5,B00LBGP5KW,"I loved this movie because it brought me back to my own EDC experiences and because it is set in Vegas, not LA. Once this event moved to Vegas, it evolved to a whole new universe which it could never have achieved within the confines and restrictions of the city of Angels. Sky's the limit, electric sky that is, in VEGAS!!",1417132800,,323,4.311475409836065

6479022,3,B00LBGP5KW,"Ok, if you're into EDM then you might like this, say, watching it with friends on a friday evening before going out, however there is very little informational value in this as it is basically one big advertisement for EDC. They only show the positives of the festival an none of the negatives like stumbling drunk people annoying everyone else. And of course, let's not forget the ""Drugs are bad, mmmkay?"" part which is almost mandatory these days if you don't want the authorities to understand what's really going on over there. So yeah, nice visuals, nice music but that's about it, don't expect anything ""deep"" to be revealed here.",1415145600,,636,4.790909090909091
6479023,3,B00LBGP5KW,"Today's Woodstock, that is probably the best description for this video. Its about the people bringing you the show, the people in the show, and the people going to the show. It's not about the music in the show because there isn't that much footage of any of the shows performers. I enjoyed it but, I don't see a second viewing in the near future.",1414713600,,348,4.369230769230769
6479024,3,B00LBGP5KW,"I enjoyed this movie, to a point. On one hand, it is just a 90 minute advertisement for a concert. On the other hand, it's a advertisement for a concert I really REALLY want to attend. The music is awesome but, some of the drama, especially the drama from a group of bros, is really cheesy. If you like EDM, check it out. If not, this probably isn't the movie for you.",1414627200,,368,4.125

6479029,3,B00LBGP5KW,"I really wish i could give this documentary 5 stars but from a critics point of view i think a three will have to do. I was actually at  EDC Las Vegas when this documentary was being filmed and it was mind blowing and more than what I had expected it to be. The atmosphere both on the strip and at EDC was infectuous, the production was larger than life and there were new djs i fell in love with and there were old favorites i fell in love with again.  With that said I wanted this documentary to offer me some brand new insight into how pasqualle brings EDC all together. I wanted to see background footage of the meetings he holds and I wanted to see a day in the regular life of the people who attend these festivals. The film only shows brief footages of pasquale and his team bringing the festival together probably just very few days pbefore the festival, which is when the stage is being set up. When it comes to the people they follow they begin following them, it seems, on the day before the festival begins when they're packing and getting ready. The rest of the film is sprinkled with footage from the festival and very short interviews with artists like Above and Beyond (a favorite of mine) and tommy sunshine. Im just really happy i didn't pay about $20 to watch this film because it wouldnt have been worth it. In essence EDC is something that has to be experienced, especially the one in Vegas.",1413244800,,1412,4.34469696969697

8664984,4,B00LBGP5KW,"Under an Electric Sky
Documentaries that explore subcultures provide a fascinating glimpse into a bit of humanity that doesn't reveal itself elsewhere. Theyre worlds that have their own unique logic and rules are created solely by the participants.

In the case of ""Under an Electric Sky,"" it's luxury raving. A byproduct of electronica, a genre fueled by music created through computers and not instruments, raves were an underground phenomenon in the 1990s.

Safe zones of play have been around us since the first amusement park was opened. Add the profit demands of capitalism to Electronic Dance Music, and you have the Electric Daisy Carnival, a three-day rigidly controlled bacchanalia put on by Insomnia. This business, founded by one of the rave pioneers, has been doing this for years, and runs multiple shows a year worldwide. It's Woodstock for ravers, running full bore on multiple stages from sun down to sun up, featuring booming basses, electronic whooshes, sonic-deafening shows, with special effects (lights, lasers, fireworks, and big white bouncing balls), carnival rides, and entertainers roaming the grounds of Las Vegas Speedway.

""Under an Electric Sky"" could have been just a concert film with clips from performers such as Calvin Harris, Fatboy Slim, Afrojack, Tiesto, and Above & Beyond. Instead, it's an 85-minute commercial for the EDC, as rigidly formatted and played out as the music it features.

The EDC's story is told from backstage and five stories from attendees recruited for their personal stories. There's the young couple divided by their work ambitions  he works in Japan, she in New York  who get to spend a bittersweet weekend in Las Vegas before returning to their separate lives. There's a polyandrous family, including a fireman and a stripper, who plan to get married at the show. There's the traditional couple who decide after a dozen years and two kids that their relationship was solid enough to get married as well. There's the wheelchair-bound Hispanic with scoliosis who refuses the ADA-approved platforms and mingles with the crowds. A pack of Massachusetts guys who style themselves the Wolfpack drive across country to celebrate themselves and mourn the recent drug overdose death of their leader. A girl with anxiety issues leaves her small town in Texas (where the music's all about country, gospel, and Lil Wayne) to experience some time with her tribe. Given the camera's intrusiveness and how big a role they play in the movie, one hopes they were at least comped their $300+ tickets.

Once you know this is a corporate documentary, the stories play out exactly as you expect. Behind the scenes, Insomnia CEO Pasquale Rotella is giving orders and making last-minute changes. He wants to show he's just another guy from the warehouse-rave scene made good, but his we see his powerful drive and instincts of a Donald Trump. His workers talk to the camera reality-show style about how much they admire their boss for making their lives harder in service of putting on the best show possible (yes, you hear ""taking it to the next level"" several times). Keep an eye out for his hot trophy wife. She's fashionably dressed and appears only at his side, playing Prince Philip to his Queen Elizabeth, and appears as out of place here as a nun in a bordello. (A little Googling revealed shes former Playboy playmate and actress Holly Madison.)

There's also corporate whitewashing. The film runs right up to the line about the presence of drugs at raves, talking about how it spoiled the underground scene and showing a medical technician working the crowd and talking about the EDC's desire for a drug-free (but not alcohol free) party. Not mentioned was EDC's early history, including how it had to leave L.A. in 2010 after a stampede injured 100 and an underage girl died from a drug overdose. Not all drug ODs are equal.

The movie is an interesting conceit, aping the desire for documentarians to present life as it is combined with the Insomnia Corp.s desire to sell its product. There are no surprises and very little drama because there's no suspense. It's a reality show that's been massaged and molded and storyboarded and nobody goes off-script. Nothing goes wrong at the shows. The anxious girl has a panic attack, but she quickly recovers, and the East Coast bros lose one of their own after the show. That drama is played up big time until it's revealed the lost soul was wandering the parking lots and couldn't remember where they had parked the RV. Next came the bleeped recriminations, followed by the tearful bro reunion.

It's easy to play the cynic, but Insomnias iron-fisted control of the images is so obvious that the manipulation is obvious. The rave scene is full of love and full of excitement and barely dressed girls and boys. There's no room for boredom, no clashes with idiots, and people party for 12 hours and talk about how tired they feel, but no one's passed out in their vomit (you barely see the fields of litter they leave behind). It's as wholesome as Disneyland and about as spontaneous,  which leads me to wonder why the DJs are there at all when the mixes leave no room for improvisation, and you can barely see the performers from the crowds. A mannequin programmed to pump his arms in time to the music would be just as effective.

The film is visually full of eye candy and the stories move along at a fast clip. The entertainment is 100 percent artificial, but the attendees are 100 percent authentic, and that's where the movie's heart is found. They're thrilled to be there. They respond to the music. The couple was silly, posing themselves as ""old candy,"" handing out toilet wipes to the kids and getting hitched after having their children (I've never fathomed the logic that prizes a wedding license above creating life), but their affection for each other and their kids, and their faux-arguments about Def Jam and Run-DMC at the dinner table are so modern and sentimental that you could imagine Ward and June looking on as Wally and the Beav talk about rock 'n' roll. You warm to them. The young couple is so much in love (at least she is; her body language screams how much she wanted him) that their parting scene at the airport is genuinely sad. And the bros for all their youthful howling and posturing are harmless and familiar to us older farts who miss that energy and abandon. Their expressions of love for their dead Wolfpack alpha  yes, they visit his grave when they get back  is so masculine and honest that one would have not only a heart of stone to laugh, but a dead soul as well. The two damaged attendees get their rewards, too, and even though it was planned, their thrills at their experiences were not.

Everybody got what they wanted. The performers got their adoration, the modern clowns and showgirls got paid, the attendees got their moments to shine, the CEO got his monument and the audience got their money's worth. I only hope Holly Madison wasn't too bored.",1480982400,,6992,4.849119865884325
