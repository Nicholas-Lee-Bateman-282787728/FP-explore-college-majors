8297748,3,B001ECRAV0,"I've used a variety of workout DVDs over the course of a few years, and I've never had trouble keeping up with them... until I tried these. To be fair, I can't say I've tried the Dance Workout for Dummies DVD - but I did try the others. The steps are not clearly explained (in any of them) and the pace starts fast and stays fast. Yes, I know - Latin dancing is not necessarily for the faint of heart, and these DVDs are meant to provide a cardio workout. They definitely make me work up a sweat, but the frustration of not being able to keep up and actually learn the moves discourages me. I have to disrupt the workout to try and figure out what the heck they're doing on the screen. To put it in perspective, I'm a fairly fit person who has had actual dancing lessons and who understands the dances these workouts come from. I didn't expect to jump in knowing everything, but I expected to at least be able to hold my own. Guess not! I'll stick with the yoga/pilates bundle and my NYC Ballet workout, thanks.",1264723200,,1011,4.243523316062176

8297750,5,B001ECRAV0,"I was really just looking for one dance video, but I decided on this one since 1) I'm familiar with Jennifer Galardi and I always like her workouts 2) It seemed like a fun package with different types of dance, and that's exactly the kind of new workout challenge I was looking for. I'm really glad I got it. The videos are all really different, so there's a ton of variety. I think it helps that I know some basic dance steps and work out an average of 30-60 minutes a day, but a beginner would be fine with these too with practice. This was a great purchase, and I would definitely recommend it.",1230336000,17,597,4.245614035087719
