5992406,3,B00FGWTNL4,"I was there and I remember the feelings of the crowds.  One big party and everyone smiling and happy.  The showers were my favorite part and they aren't even shown.  A huge open area with a couple of hundred pole showers.  Everybody swaying to the music as you try to drop your temperature.  The two years have mingled and meshed in my mind so it's hard to remember what happened when.  I will never forget waking up in the camp and hearing what I thought was a recording as it was very early.  Next thing I know i'm walking in and listening to breakfast with The Dead.  Grateful Dead just playing and waking folks up.  The computer tents were awesome and a hell of a mix with the music.
The movie doesn't quite get there for me.  Maybe paradise is tough to capture on a screen.",1388448000,,778,4.267123287671233
5992407,1,B00FGWTNL4,"You do NOT get full songs in this collection.  You get interview segments leading up the the vocal, during the solos in some cases.  This looks to be the same package that was aired on VH1 classics.  You would think that the geniuses behind the concert would release the SONGS and maybe do a documentary as a special feature.  You do NOT get the full songs listed on the package which is a complete rip-off if you ask me.  Triumph, Judas Priest, Quiet Riot have all released their full sets on dvd with NO interview crap over the music.  THEY did it right....why can't Unuson Corp????",1388102400,2,584,4.462264150943396
5992408,3,B00FGWTNL4,"I've been awaiting this documentary for YEARS, having attended both the '82 and '83 US Festivals. Unfortunately, this seems almost hastily thrown together, with footage of many bands missing. While it brought back many memories, only 1 song is shown from many of the bands, but, unfortunately, we are subjected to no less than 4 songs from Triumph! (who?). The backstory from Steve Wozniak is somewhat interesting (after all, if it weren't for his Apple $, neither fest would have come together), but one does get tired of the same platitudes about the bands' performances and lack of insight offered from Mark (""Where are They Now"") Goodman.

Hopefully, the producers will one day offer separate videos of each of the three days so that we can all get a better idea of what US Fest was really like!",1387584000,4,799,4.7898550724637685
5992409,1,B00FGWTNL4,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. Obvious from the cover, it was a ""highlight"" of the US Festival. A TRUE music fan would have been exstatic to have a boxed set of this....showcasing EVERY band's FULL length performance over the three day festival. I would have PAID to have this for sure. This DVD is only a ""cliff notes"" version and a poor one at that. I was extremely disappointed over the fact that Berlin's song wasn't even a full song....maybe 30 seconds of coverage/music of their performance while the rest was listening to Mark Goodman talk and watching a bunch of people dance. I was even more upset that Mark Goodman once again talked over U2's performance. Why couldn't the interview portion be at the beginning or the end....NOT DURING!!!!

This DVD could have been really something amazing had it been full performance. Maybe they will get wise and release it in full format. If you are set on having just a glimpse this is your DVD.",1386547200,81,957,4.662721893491124
5992410,4,B00FGWTNL4,"Ive already read the previous reviews posted here and hope I can add a bit of clarity to the situation  as I seem to be one of the few reviewers who wasn't at the California concert in 1983. (With an estimated 670,000 people there, I can now see why so many reviewers commented on that.). But Im on the East Coast and not a fan of huge festivals where you cant hear the performers, let alone see them.
As another person pointed out, many of the performers who were at the Festival (which Steve Wozniak dished out $22 million to mount as a free event) had contracts that limited whether their performance could be recorded and, if  so, how many songs were allowed. This was, of course, before iPhones, though there were camcorders and Im guessing that there is some private video out there of the performances not on this DVD.  If your favorite act is not here, I understand, but if it is, then you MIGHT consider it, but know what you are getting.

The DVD has 3 days of programs. Each one fills 44 minutes so it is obvious that this was originally meant for commercial TV or  most probably MTV. I say that because the performances are separated by comments from Woz as well as MTV DJ Mark Goodman. These interviews are more recent.  At the end of each days program there are two sets of credits. The credits from 2003 are given but also a set from 2009, which may be when Goodman and Woz added their commentary. And now it is being released in 2013 by MVD.

The images are standard 4:3 resolution  not wide screen  which again gives the impression that this was for television viewing. And don't expect Hi-def or hi-fi sound . For a guy who invented one of the first PCs, I was surprised at the low video resolution on this DVD. The bands vary in style and name. Berlin is here but since their hit from the Top Gun soundtrack went off the charts, theres been little heard from them. And here is U2 EARLY in their career with Bono having a blonde streak in his hair. Maybe its me, but Stevie Nicks sounded way off-key in her two numbers.
No its not Woodstock or Live Aid or Monterey Pop but a few of these performances by lesser known bands are entertaining. And its not a $60. Box set.  Its 135 minutes of rock footage  with some commentary to put it in perspective  and I certainly enjoyed watching it once.

Don't wait - expecting a better version of this Festival. It took 30 years for this to come out so you either settle for this version or not. That's really the bottom line.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5992411,5,B00FGWTNL4,When each band signed to play US83 part of the contract was that US83 has the rights to only 2 songs for each band with the exception of Bowie who did not give rights to any of his performance.  That is why this DVD only has a few songs from only some of the bands there.  It was a spectacular 3 days that would not be affordable if all the bands are shown in their entirety.

5992413,1,B00FGWTNL4,If they can put a couple of songs on here......why can't entire sets be released?  You only get a couple of songs from each group.  Triumph has 4 or 5 songs....WHY?  They have already released their entire concert on DVD/CD a couple of years ago.  Same with Priest......they released their entire video concert on 30th anniv of the Screaming for Vengeance CD reissue.

I know there must be so much more video existing because it was filmed continuously. That being said, what does exist is a fair stamp of the music of the time.  A  80's time capsule for music lovers? I love The Clash and realize the swan song show was considered bad. But hey, it was The Clash minus Topper.. U2 was stellar. So many great acts to mention.",1481760000,,494,4.53932584269663

Many thanks to Steve Wozniak (the forgotten half of the Apple dynamic duo) for making this event happen.  I'm guessing it would have been pretty amazing (and very hot) to be there!

5992454,3,B00FGWTNL4,"Meh.
While there were some good performances, they skipped a LOT of them. Also, no Van Halen? VH was the headliner for ""Metal Day"", and were the big get for the festival. There was a large amount of press for them, as they were paid 1M to do the concert (an unheard of amount at the time and a world record pay-out). With that in mind, it seemed strange to not even mention VH, besides the ""feud"" they had with The Clash.
The production wasn't great, with many of the crowd shots being used over and over again. The sound between the concert and the ""talking head"" interviews was different too, as one was loud and the other was barely audible (I had to keep adjusting my TV volume between the two). There was also this weird thing where they showed Triumph twice - Once for ""Metal Day"" and once for ""Rock Day"", even though Triumph didn't play on both days, although they showed them doing different songs on both days. The whole thing kind of felt like a rushed copy/edit from VHS. Truthfully, you can find most if not all of this stuff from video sites online. It was fun to watch, but lacked a lot of content.",1473638400,,1112,4.3253588516746415
5992455,2,B00FGWTNL4,"Wow, this is really dated!  I can't believe I lived through this time period in the 80s.  I'd skip this one even if the band seem interesting.  Not much in the way of a documentary of the 1983 US Festival.",1473638400,,205,4.075

5992463,3,B00FGWTNL4,"Perhaps due to licensing this is somewhat flat.  Admittedly for something like this you would have had to be there.  But it's not a particularly worthy collection of mini-concerts or a insightful documentary.  What it is ""a slice"" of the event, and a thin one in spite of running time at that.  As concert tapes and DVDs became an integral part, just like the albums, bands tightly controlled what would be released as ""official"" releases.  They wanted their best foot forward, of course, which wasn't likely to be a festival date.  It's a shame since many ""warts and all"" concerts are full of energy that the more ""intended"" concert releases lack.  Besides few full songs, many times not the one or two I'd pick, the big absence is no Van Halen.  I've never seen a Van Halen concert video I really liked anyway...but, I'd liked to have seen them here playing for the absolutely ridiculous sum of $17,000 per minute (approximately 1.5 million total).  They better be glad someone like Woz existed because even bringing Elvis back wouldn't be worth that, LOL!  At any rate, don't look at this as a concert video, or even much of a documentary.  It's a snapshot of something that happened once (twice if you count the 2 back-to-back US Fests) and it's a rare thing in that regard and worth a look if you have an interest.  Not so much for anyone else I'd have to say though.",1471651200,2,1372,4.577868852459017

The US (not U S) festival was not something I was aware had ever been held. This video had a lot of info on it narratively speaking  about what it took to make the festival possible, etc.  It showed the crowds, the bands playing live on stage performances. The visions of the punk hairdo,the wild make up and clothing styles of that era make for interesting conversation. (I grew up with stuff and looking back, its hard to believe I thought we  were all so cool looking.
If you have teens this makes for a good  history/learning video about that time frame with regards to the music, fashion, freedom (carefree-ness), and even a little about the past technologies. The US festival  compares to Woodstock, just a different generation.",1457222400,,872,4.528662420382165

Honestly, you can find better clips of the US festivals on free video sites like that one owned by Google.  This video has some serious audio issues, and it has nothing to do with the age, it's whoever put this thing together that is to blame.  Dialogue is really quiet, the performances loud.  Throughout the video, dialogue will cut in in the middle of a performance to share some reminiscing, so you turn it up to hear what they're saying, then the dialogue stops and the TV is suddenly alarmingly loud, which was particularly annoying during Triumph.  I tried turning on closed captioning so I didn't have to mess with the volume, but it couldn't understand much of what was being said either, and it left an annoying ""music playing"" text in the middle of the performances. needless to say, CC didn't last long.

Regarding the performers.  Kind of cool.  I know there were a lot more performers there that I would have rather seen, but what can you do?  My one minor complaint, even though Triumph is a talented group of guys, there was way too much Triumph on this concert.  Lay it on the Line and Magic Power should have been the end of it, but it seemed to go on and on to me.  Day 2 and Day 3.  Maybe the Woz is a huge Triumph fan.",1428624000,,1328,4.349593495934959

5992601,3,B00FGWTNL4,"I watched this on Amazon Prime, so this review is based on that experience, rather than the DVD.  I don't think I would have been happy to have purchased this on DVD.  However, I enjoyed quite a bit of this watching it online, if only for nostalgic purposes.  I was, of course annoyed by the interruptions by the now ancient Mark Goodman.  I suppose if you approach it with low expectations, you will find something to like.  Sad, but true.
I definitely would have liked to see more of the Divinyls and Berlin.  Triumph brought back a lot of memories, but were given a heck of a lot more time on this than any other band.  Don't try to make sense of any of this.  Just enjoy what is here and hope that possibly, someone will get around to doing this right someday, hopefully before we are all too old to really appreciate it.
I think for me, one of the highlights of this video, although brief, was the Missing Persons song, ""Words"".  One forgets just how brilliant this band was, both musically and lyrically.  And ahead of their time?  Think about No Doubt, Pink, Garbage, and of course, Lady Gaga.  Apparently Missing Persons was a band that started in the mid to late nineties, but traveled back in time before anyone knew who they were, and ended up in the eighties, just in time for this festival.  They always seemed so alien back then...
The main impression that I got from this is - aside from it being ""The Woodstock of the 1980s"", if that can even be said (It shouldn't), although I would say that it was ""The event that ushered in the true 80s"" or ""The shape of things to come"" or some such nonsense - The main impression would be that this event is begging to be put on a Blu Ray disc with all of the performances, from all of the bands that were present (leave the interviews out)  I realize that this is contractually impossible.  It never was possible as each of the artists were contracted separately and some of them agreed to video rights, while others forbade it or retained those rights for themselves.  But these mofos were all paid a lot of money!  Those of us that are still fans of this music and these types of events would likely shell out more than what a ticket cost back then (20 bucks per day = $60) to see this on Blu Ray in its entirety.  You  telling me you can't negotiate a new contract?!  Well, I guess there are always the bootlegs...",1423267200,,2372,4.347727272727273

Unfortunately the audio was distorted for interviews,  however the footage of the concert performers was excellent.  It was like they had two film crews shoot the acts and another  had substandard equipment for interviews of which there were very few.  The film is especially enjoyable for people who experienced  the early 80's.  It would deserve 4 stars if audio was consistent,more depth of interviews and background of the concert.

5992610,1,B00FGWTNL4,"Let me start by saying that I was around when the US festivals (82 & 83) took place, and for anyone of my age at the time, the excitement that surrounded the event was palpable in the Southern California area.  At the '83 US festival, there were so many great stories before and as the event took place - Bowie was playing in the U.S. for the first time in several years;  Van Halen was receiving 1.5 million dollars to headline the 'metal day;' the Clash threw a hissy fit before they went on regarding the difference (compared to Van Halen) in pay that they were receiving for headlining the first day of the festival.

But forget all that, this video flat out is a waste of precious minutes of your life.  The Clash gets limited exposure - with a recording of one of their most commercial (and boring) songs at that; U2 , who were not terribly high on the bill the day they played, gave one of their breakout performances, which left the crowd chanting for their return - no viewer of this video will be left with any sense of that moment.  And if you like metal, Priest and the Scorpions, who had great sets, are not shown enough.  Instead, we are left with acts Quarterflash and Missing Persons? Thanks for reminding me that I once listened to those guys when I was too lazy to change the station.

5992626,4,B00FGWTNL4,"yea its good, but the 83 us fest , 2nd day, the day i was there, and loved every minute, was the greatest day of rock n roll in history, to that day. it was the biggest rock fest on record, and the 1st of its kind. don't get me wrong, woodstock rules, but we had a million people there, according to my eyes and lots of news reports i saw afterward. twice woodstock, for sure, and 10 times the heavy metal, to be sure. from what ive read, over the years, 83 us fest 2nd day broke every record in the book for size. and it was the 1st of its kind in a lot of ways. thousands of port a toilets, kept clean. wine gardens and fabulous food courts with good food. plenty of security and wonderful cool crowd. hotter than hell, but sprinklers cooled us off. they thought of everything. it was like woodstock at a five star restaurant.
  anyway now for the review. i taped the showtime special of day two of the 83 us fest, just a month or so after it happened on tv. it was fantastic, and was 5 or so hours long. it had all the bands, and still it had to skip, more than half the music, because it would half to be 12 or 13 hours long to do that. still it did the concert justice. what i wouldn't give to see that showtime special again. my copy got lost just 20 years ago. .... what this is, is a short , short , short ,short version of what happened over three days. yea its ok, gives you a TINY sense of what actually happened, But not even close, to what happened and who played there. on day two they leave out most of the bands that played there. hey , if you could only see and experience the UFO FLYING SAUCER that flew over the concert, between triumph and the scorpions, and hear the alien in his ship talk to us, real time and show us his planet and rock festival going on in another galaxy, well, you'd have a better idea of how incredible this concert was. and yes , 4 or 5 helicopters with steel cables flew over the crowd holding up this actual flying saucer, while the alien came on the diamond vision screens, 1st time they were used. and talked to us, man, it was something else. anyway, thanks amazon for putting this here, and please show us the rest!!!!",1405036800,,2168,4.0988235294117645

There is a bit of voice over in some songs, by the MTV VJ who was at the show, reminiscing about the festival...maybe I have 2 complaints.

The audio quality is not very good - narrative is much louder than the actual performances. It appears many of the bands that played that weekend are not represented on the video. Of the bands represented the balance of material by each band is a bit out of whack.

I really enjoyed seeing Missing Persons (Lady Gaga fans take note who was the original) and a young Stevie Nicks. INXS (I saw then twice live) always put on a good set and Bono's antics are classic.

I nearly teared up as it took me back to what would turn out to be one of the best days of my life. The commentary didn't bother me, it did make it more like a documentary. I enjoyed watching the crowd shots as it helped take me back to that fabulous little misty memory. Am I the only one who kept pausing while trying to find myself in the audience?!  Mark Goodman said it best when he mentioned the vibe of the audience, it was all about fun (except for the little skirmish in the parking lot/campground between day 1 and 2 haha!) I wasn't making much money in 1983 and was only able to attend day 1 but really wanted to see day 2 also. I didn't know how to pull that off, so this DVD helped fill a bit of that void. Too bad they didn't include the space ship and Jumbo-Tron alien commentary, I thought it was a great fluff piece on the eve of day 1. Also the bit of drama when The Clash was late taking stage due to an argument over money, but I can see why they wouldn't want to mention that in the DVD. Perhaps that was Joe's way of fighting back against being labeled a sell out, RIP JS. If a lack of full band sets will bother you then this is likely not the product for you.

5992637,2,B00FGWTNL4,"Yes, some performances are interrupted by commentary, but my biggest complaint is that two of those are during U2's performance, and U2's song, Electric Co., is shortened by very choppy editing.  For example, they cut out much of Bono's breathtaking climb up the rope ladder to the top of the rigging.  Then, once they show him up there, you can see Bono gesturing to someone to come to him.  What they cut out is Bono having his tall, white flag delivered to him which he then drags halfway across the top and holds up high just before throwing it in dramatic fashion off the canopy from which it flutters down about 50 or 100 feet to the bottom. All this is accompanied by dramatic guitar riffs and drums from the band.  All you get instead is about one second of Bono climbing back down the ladder and then a very obvious cut in the music and video to the point where Bono re-enters from stage left at the end of the song.  I had even less patience for that edit when the very next performance was more of ... Triumph?  They had already shown three songs from Triumph in the Day 2 footage, so why they had to cut part of U2 and then use up more DVD space on Triumph is beyond me.  The unedited version of Electric Co. was shown on Showtime in the 1980s, so I'm sure you can find good quality video of it somewhere.  Otherwise, get the Red Rocks DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-a-Blood-Red-Sky-Deluxe-Edition-CD-DVD/dp/B0015FML06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under a Blood Red Sky - Deluxe Edition CD/DVD</a>&nbsp;and you'll get the idea.

All that said, after watching Day 2, I wondered how anyone who was there was able to hear anything on Day 3.  That Day 2 Heavy Metal day was LOUD!  If you're parents don't hear well, they were probably at Day 2 of the US Festival.  I enjoyed those performances, though.  You just have to turn it up louder when Judas Priest comes out.

So of course it was put together to be family friendly. What I do remember about the concert was that it was some very family friendly days and everybody was getting along. Except of course my friends girlfriend that was a whinny twit all day. Losing my 14 year old brother was the highlight of our day. But hey! he's my brother and I knew he would survive and maybe learn about life, love and the pursuit of the party, lol. Actually this was one of the last concerts before corporations started making everything over priced and a cluster funky hassle. So enjoy this blast from the past and see some bands that are starting out new, and some that are no longer with us.",1390780800,,802,4.282894736842105
5992649,2,B00FGWTNL4,"Just a cursory showing of some of the bands that played the festival with poor audio to boot.  The music sounds OK but the narration is very quiet in level.  Speaking of narration, it sucks and they duck the music right out to put that crap in.  Really awful.  This event deserves a multi DVD set with all performances intact.",1390176000,4,326,4.383333333333334
5992650,3,B00FGWTNL4,"While the video is interrupted with commentary and they are missing most the bands performances, it still brought back good memories.  I was there on rock day and it was just like I remembered, packed to the gills.  I was hoping to see David Lee forget all the words to his songs again...too bad.  If you were there, its worth the watch cause if your memory is like mine most of it was a blur.  If not, it'll be a waste of your time.",1389657600,4,433,4.119047619047619
5992651,3,B00FGWTNL4,"The Us Festival was one of the landmark festivals of the 1980s. Several artists have capitalized on their appearance in recent years, including Quiet Riot, Triumph, Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson. There is a 3-disc set available of Metal Day with Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, and more. But there is not much out there for fans of the pop side of the Us Festival.

MVDvisual fills a bit of that void with 83 Us Festival Days 1-3, available on DVD. The disc features live performances by Divinyls, Men At Work, Judas Priest, Missing Persons, and Stevie Nicks, as well as interviews with organizer Steve Wozniak and MTV veejay Mark Goodman. The interviews overlap some of the music, and that is a bit disappointing, but thats a minor complaint considering the importance of the documentary. The best performances on the DVD come from U2 (Sunday Bloody Sunday), Triumph (Lay It On The Line), and The Clash (Should I Stay Or Should I Go). In fact, The Clashs performance was their last with Mick Jones, making the song choice even more poignant.

5992653,2,B00FGWTNL4,"The Pretenders played better than the other 3 times I had seen them. Why weren't they shown here?
That time at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium was cool, the drummer liked throwing his stick way up and catch it just in time for the final beat at the end of a song. But the bassist liked to sneak up behind him and grab the stick on its way down, making that drummer miss the ending...fumbling for a spare ~ all in good showmanship and fun.",1388880000,,440,4.188235294117647
