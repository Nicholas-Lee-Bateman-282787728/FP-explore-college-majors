The original on DVD was okay, with major imperfections popping up here and there. Lines, wavy screen, and unexpected cut offs. It would be nice if those things are corrected in the blu-ray release.

6229712,5,B00HVFA39A,"The news of this upcoming Deluxe Remastered Edition was a total surprise when I read it, but I could not be more pleased !

I already bought all the DVD sets but I welcome the chance to see this wonderful series in a better quality, so I won't hesitate to buy all the seasons again if they are produced in the future.

It may have been 40 years ago, but the pleasure remains the same, even after all this time.
I'm addicted to many different kinds of series but Little House still have a special place in my memory and my heart.

At this time, I'm not really sure that I'll be able to watch the blu-rays with my European player.
No information about the code-zone is available when I write this comment.
I decided to pre-order the Blu-ray Edition anyhow and I hope it will not be coded only with the A zone.

It would be disappointing not to be able to watch these Blu-rays in Europe (zone B), as the only DVD Edition available in France is not even spoken in English, but only dubbed in French.
And believe me, it's really awfull to hear Young children speak with a French adult voice ...

So I'm keeping my fingers crossed for this Remastered Edition ...!!",1390867200,4,1158,4.317972350230415

I can't say that for most other shows I've already bought on DVD, but I can with this one, and it's nice that this is one of the few TV shows that are finally receiving the blu-ray treatment.  Most other series will probably never make it to blu-ray.  The series is that good, as it was beautifully filmed, and is worthy of watching in the highest possible quality on a large HDTV (I prefer plasma, 50 inch+).  Don't forget to do an Amazon search for more seasons from time to time, as they will likely be released before long.  Also be sure to check out tvshowsondvd.com for detailed press releases concerning the Season 1 blu-ray and upcoming releases.",1390435200,14,761,4.4855072463768115

6229715,5,B00HVFA39A,"Let's face it: if you grew up in the 1970's and early eighties, as I did, you watched ""Little House on the Prairie"" every Monday night on NBC. It was actually, for many years, NBC's only Top 10 rated show. Then as the eighties and nineties rolled around TBS aired the series every morning so viewers who had missed it in it's original broadcast form could discover it and for me it was reliving old times with old friends.

 After multiple releases by various distributors both in the U.S. and Canada and after obviously hearing the outcry from fans who voiced the shoddy and disrespectful way ""Little House"" was released, ""Little House-Season 1"" is not only coming out on DVD, but Blu Ray as well. More importantly the series' episodes are going to be the original uncut versions that NBC aired decades ago so the series, for the first time, will come to home viewing uncut with ALL scenes in tact.

 I had always wanted to purchase the ""Little House"" series, but after reading reviews here on Amazon about the fact that the syndicated episodes were what was made available, I thought someday the series HAS to be released in its entirety.

 ""Little House on the Prairie-Season 1"" will hit stores March 25th, 2014 with all season 1 episodes and a wealth of bonus features including the original telefilm that served as the series pilot that ultimately was sold it to NBC, original screen tests for Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert, the 40th Anniversary Documentary: The ""Little House"" Phenomenon-Part 1, A Place in Television History and all 24 episodes uncut and fully remastered. Both the DVD and Blu Ray versions will be closed captioned and English and Spanish subtitles are in both formats, French (DVD only) and Farsi (Blu Ray).

The following is a complete listing of Season 1 episodes along with their original NBC air dates: (the series finished a very respectable #13 in the Nielsen Ratings)

The Pilot Film, March 30, 1974
1. ""A Harvest of Friends"", Sept. 11, 1974
2. ""Country Girls"", Sept. 18, 1974 This episode marks the first time Nellie (Alison Arngrim) and Mrs. Olson (Katherine MacGregor) (my two favorite characters from the show) are introduced.
3. ""100 Mile Walk"", Sept. 25, 1974
4. ""Mr. Edward's Homecoming"", Oct., 2, 1974
5. ""The Love of Johnny Johnson"", Oct. 12, 1974
6. ""If I Should Wake Before I Die"", Oct. 23, 1974

Just a small request, in case you are still authoring the DVDs: PLEASE include the teasers that preceded the opening titles, as well as the bumpers. These parts, which may not be important to some, are a nice touch when watching the episodes. You will definitely score a lot of points if you include them.

For a television show shot in the 1970s, the transfer I feel is quite good. Colors are vibrant and interesting with a presence of grain that is reasonable. It is advantageous that the series was filmed on 35mm as it one of probably a handful of shows that can still take advantage of Blu-Ray. Sound quality is adequate and balanced, no unevenness or excessive noise.

6229738,5,B00HVFA39A,"Little House on the Prairie was one of my favorite book series when I was a child. My second grade teacher started reading it to us, and I read the entire series. And, then when my children were young the TV series with Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon came onto the scene. I have watched the series with my children, my first granddaughter and now, my second granddaughter.

Pa, Ma Wilder and the children, Laura and Mary of the prairie. We went with them through all their obstacles, the sickness of Mary, the birth of children, moving to their own farm, the store owner and his family, the teacher at the school, all of the issues and problems that the family, the children and Ma and Pa had together. Thus was a time in our history when the West was young, the earth was new, the farming good. New lives, new adventures, to share, and this series gives us hope. So much love and kindness in this family,and that won the day, every time.

In this first year series we receive 23 episodes. We are introduced to the family and their way of life. The early rising, Ma making breakfast and all the food over an open fire at first. Sleeping in the loft, walking to school, Pa with his horses farming and eventually owning a lumber yard. The picnics, the meals, the friends, the foes, all, such a wonderful time. What a joy to remember this series with my grandchildren.

Highly Recommended. prisrob  03-06-16",1457222400,7,1408,4.509803921568627

They don't confine their discussion to the season you've just watched.  It wasn't so bad on Season 1, but Season 2 contained some stuff I didn't need to see at that point and season 3 was outrageous, talking about major events that haven't happened yet and characters that haven't even been introduced.  I'm going to save up all the bonus material from now on and watch it all at the very end.

The show is fantastic but you probably already know that as well. What you're probably wondering is how good of a job did they do ""Remastering"" the original shows. Or, did they shorten the shows? Basically, is it worth spending your hard earned money on these Blu-ray releases? YES!!!
I'm always skeptical of ""Remastered"" shows and movies. Most of the one's I have seen are barely any better then the original release. This is certainly not the case with this release. The picture quality is excellent, so good in fact that It's hard to believe the show dates back almost 40 years ago. The sound quality is outstanding as well.
If you're a Little House fan this is the set to own. This Remastered Blu-ray release has both picture and sound quality that blows away the DVD release. You won't be disappointed.",1425859200,22,943,4.686746987951807

6229788,4,B00HVFA39A,"UPDATE: September 8, 2014

Blu-Ray- I watched the episode of Season 1 entitled, Family Quarrel, where the Olson's are at war with each other. The QA tester should be fired. The subtitles for this episode are that of the previous episode, A Plum Creak Christmas (or something title like that).

Blu-Ray- There is another quasi bug, but we are digging into the recesses of my memory for this one. The episode where Caroline has baby Charles, The Lord is My Shepard, Parts 1 and 2 has a missing scene that was present on the original broadcast. Supposedly, the Blu-Ray brought back all deleted scenes. Sadly, many years went by since 1974. The first episode talks of Laura's being jealous of her baby brother. As I recall, there was a scene where either Laura wished something bad on her brother, but was said out loud, more than the scene where she has to say a prayer for her brother and she refuses telling Mary, please go and tell. Pa is too busy with baby Charles. There was a scene well before that that is not there now.

UPDATE:
Thank you to the person that told me to upgrade my player. I have a Sony BDP-S560. I never saw any use for the network connection, as BD-Live never seemed to do anything. There was an update for the firmware, 11.0.4.1 (or something like that) to .4.

The player took its sweet time loading the disk. The first time the remote control buttons did not work, but then going back to the start and waiting about a minute the remote control worked and the navigation menu appeared.

NOTE: I have a CRT television, so the video shows in standard 4:3, but with a twist. It first shows as 16:9 with bars on the top and bottom and then bars on the left and right, so the video was reduced by 25% or so of the screen. :-(

What I can tell you is that the color is infinitely better and the video is crisp, unlike the DVD (I own that as well). The sound is far better. I always hated the old sound. Hopefully, this version includes the scenes removed from the DVD. I will see as I watch the series.

I was debating 4 or 5 stars, but that would only come with hardware that does not exist for me yet.

Original:
It is hard to give a star rating on something that I cannot watch.

This series requires a newer Blu-Ray player than I have, so I will have to update my player, not that my Sony Blu-Ray player is that old, just about 3 or 4 years old and works great, just this title obsoleted my player.

With the release of the Blu Ray format, the picture and sound quality are superb.

My oldest daughter (currently age 12) and I have been reading the Little House series books since she was a baby. We started with the board books and moved through the various versions until we started the chapter books. We're still reading the chapter books but she's finally outgrowing them (Harry Potter moved in a few years ago and more recently it was The Hunger Games series, and the list will go on). We still read from the books but it's been nice to finally introduce the television series that I grew up with to her. I now have a 10 month old baby girl and I'm already reading the Little House board books to her so it will be fun to start the experience all over again. I'm loving the Blu-Rays. The quality is incredible and the price is hard to beat! We pre-ordered ours and paid $18.96 here on Amazon. How could you go wrong? (In comparison I've been paying anywhere between $40-$65 per season for the Doctor Who blu-ray sets!) This review is for season one and two. I'm hoping (praying!) for the studio to release the remaining seasons. I'm urging the fans to go out and buy the sets so we can send a message to the studio that we want the remastered product and are willing to pay for it.

The picture was very crisp and detailed. I normally wouldn't get BR for a TV show (price, mainly but also being BR limits where I can watch), it is worth it in this case!

Edit: I'm 3 discs in and mostly the visual aspect has held up with a few exceptions (see episode The Lord is My Shepherd Part 2 in the mountains, especially) where it gets really grainy.

I was way too cool for all that at the time! haha Now, fifteen or so years later I decide to give it another whirl after reading a review and thinking back. Wow!! What a well written and produced series this is, and (mostly) an outstanding cast.

Each episode relays the everyday life of the Ingalls family during the Pioneer days of America. Which may sound dull, absurd in this day and age, or even be hard to swallow if watching for the first time. Although, if you give it a chance you will most likely be surprised to find great life lessons wrapped within interesting settings of characters and stories. Michael Landon was also not afraid of writing God into his Little House series and that is something I admire him for. I know it more acceptable back then but nonetheless still admirable and done tastefully.

As far as the blu-ray release is concerned, there is a lot of value to be had in this release. Picture clarity and color has been updated quite nicely, definitely not the bare-minimum remaster. Sound is good for an older show. Purchased my copy for under $20 and there is a lot of watch time on here with only one or two so-so episodes.

6229822,5,B00HVFA39A,"""Little House On The Prairie Season One""
(Blu-ray Edition)
(CBS, 1974/2014)
. . . .

Michael Landon's TV adaptation of ""The Little House On The Prairie"" debuted in 1974, and came in a period when cultural barriers were falling in America, and taboos were being broken left and right. At the time, the show was seen as ""square"" but it definitely filled a gap in the changing media landscape for the swiftly-vanishing breed of non-""edgy"" kid-friendly programming.

Much of the show's success was due to its historical setting, an amber-tinted frontier-days narrative that was literally a hundred years away from the crime, political turmoil and economic malaise of the '70s -- it was a real break from the cynical modern world, and it didn't have many touchpoints to link it to the culture wars of the time. It's similar in some ways to the long-running ""Waltons,"" but is less glaringly quaint and rustic, striking a nice balance between ""old-time"" and modern sensibilities -- audiences could identify with the characters but also enjoy the historical setting.

The show sticks pretty closely to the original Laura Ingalls Wilder books, particularly on the pilot episode, which faithfully adapts several adventures from the first book.  Later episodes take on more of the formulaic 1970s episode-of-the-week TV approach, but stay true to the material and expand nicely on the ""Little House"" canon, with heartwarming stories of honesty, hard work and the balance of self-reliance and community that built the American frontier. The show also features a fine cast, led by Landon and the super-cute, precocious Melissa Gilbert, who became the icon of plain-jane, brown-haired, tomboyish little girls across the world. There are many shows that were popular in the '60s, '70s and '80s that seem quite dated (""Mork And Mindy,"" ""Welcome Back Kotter,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" et.al.) but the same timelessness that made ""Little House"" a success in the 'Seventies still makes it a winner today.

First a short rant - I find Blu-rays frustrating.  The picture and sound are great but the load times are terrible, at least on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-BDV-T11-Home-Theater-System/dp/B002OCDOG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony BDV-T11 Home Theater System</a>.  The time from closing the tray to getting to the main menu takes 2:30.  A DVD doesn't take nearly as long.  Remember how a VHS tape could get going in less than 10 seconds?

On to the review - The difference in quality between this Blu-ray and the old DVDs (or television rebroadcasts) is stunning.  The picture is so much better in that it's cleaned up, much sharper and more vivid.  The sound is pretty good too.  The Blu-ray doesn't come with a booklet describing the episodes like the DVD set did but that's minor.

There is no option for a scene index but there are chapters so you can skip to them, you just don't know what they are.  Unlike some other discs (which bugs me to no end), this one lets you resume playback from where you left off if it's stopped.

The DVD set has one opening credits with the theme song per disc.  The Blu-ray has it on each episode.

If the Blu-ray has all uncut episodes, then the old DVD contains a deleted scene placed in context.  It's in the episode ""Country Girls"" on disc 1.  I wonder if this happened in any other episodes which I haven't compared.

In general, there are slight differences in how much of the picture is shown.  One may show a bit more a bit more on the left, right, top, or bottom than the other.  It's nothing significant.  At least one scene (maybe more) is cropped differently in the DVD.  In ""The Love of Johnny Johnson"" after the girls get out of school (about 13 minutes into the episode), Mary sits on a rock waiting for Laura who goes back into the schoolhouse.  In the Blu-ray version, you can see almost from the peak of the building's roof down to the shadow of the rock Mary's sitting on.  You can also see the trunk of a tree on the left and two on the right.  In the DVD, it shows from near the top of the window of the building to the top quarter of the rock (nowhere near the shadow).  The tree on the left is missing, as is a quarter of the schoolhouse, and one of the two trees on the right is also missing.  I found it really strange that they would do that.

I compared the first two discs, except for the Pilot.  I don't plan to compare the other discs as it takes a very long time and a good attention span to watch two things at the same time.  I might have missed some things.  I found many DVD episodes were time compressed to shave off about 2 minutes.  I also found that the DVD episodes varied in length from 44:24 to 46:03, not counting the opening credits/song.  The Blu-ray episodes were about 49 minutes long with the credits/song except Country Girls, which was 30 seconds shorter.  Below are the differences I found in the two discs along with the length of each episode on DVD.

A Harvest of Friends - Time compressed (DVD 45:55)

Country Girls - Time compressed and the DVD has about 30 seconds of extra material after Laura's recitation.  This Blu-ray episode is 30 seconds shorter than the others (about 48 min 30 sec vs 49 min for all the others) (DVD 46:00)

100 Mile Walk - Time compressed (DVD 46:01)

Mr. Edwards' (Edward's) Homecoming - Time compressed (DVD 46:03)

The Love of Johnny Johnson - Time compressed (DVD 45:59)

If I Should Wake Before I Die - This is not time compressed.  After Maddie's funeral, the DVD cut out a scene where Charles drives Amy back home and she enters the house, sits down and holds a picture (about 2:10 long).  Later, after Charles and Dr. Baker make promises to Amy, she gets out of bed.  The DVD cut out about 6 seconds from the scene right after that.  Even later, during the wake after the scene with Mrs. Olsen and the priest, the DVD cut out about 35 seconds where Laura goes to her sisters then returns to her mother.  Further into the wake, the DVD cut out about 40 seconds where the girls talk to Maureen (the little girl) and Amy meanders through the room.  Later when Andy arrives, the DVD cuts out just a couple seconds.  (DVD 44:24)

Town Party - Country Party - This is not time compressed.  After the dinner scene (about 6 minutes into the episode), the DVD cut out 1:15 showing Laura's bath as well as Carrie and Jack's ""bath"".  Later where Charles is speaking to Olga's father, the DVD cut out about 1 minute of the conversation.  Later during the three-a-cat game, the DVD cut out about 30 seconds of the game.  The beginning 45 seconds of the scene where the girls are wading in the creek was cut on the DVD as well.  (DVD 44:24)

Ma's Holiday - Time compressed (DVD 45:55)

School Mom - Time compressed.  The DVD cut out about 10 seconds of the conversation between Caroline and Abel's father as well as around 2 seconds from the end of the scene where Charles and Caroline are talking in bed.  (DVD 45:45)

Overall I'm very happy with the Blu-ray version (loading times not withstanding).  I look forward to leisurely watching the other episodes as well as getting future seasons.  Like so many others, I was frustrated with the abrupt scene cuts in the DVD releases.  I just hope the other episodes on the Blu-ray don't cut out material like the ""Country Girls"" episode did.",1397779200,10,5754,4.688311688311688

6229829,5,B00HVFA39A,"Growing up in the 70s, Little House On The Prairie was one of my very favorite tv shows and the the whole family used to watch this show (along with Muppet Show, Charlie's Angels, Three's Company) on Channel 7 Sunday nights here in the Philippines. Therefore, I was so excited when I found out years ago that the entire series was available as a set on DVD. I saved and spent quite a huge amount of money to get the whole set which was creatively placed in a replica of the family wagon. As soon as I viewed the initial disc and randomly played the other discs, I realized that a huge injustice had been done! The transfer to DVD was so bad - the picture was not clear at all and the sound quality was horrible. I checked it out on a small tv and it still was not clear at all. Usually 70s series on DVD are only clear on small tvs but not on big tvs because of limitations in technology then. Anyway, the purchase of this set was one of the most disappointing things that ever happened to me as a collector of classic movies and tv series. What choice did I have? Return the whole set? As a fan, I was just happy enough to own the set even if the quality was so bad it was virtually unwatchable. I never bothered to watch the DVD set again and just kept the set in one of my cabinets for posterity. Charge to my credit card and charge to experience.

Anyway, to cut this review short. I am sooooo pleased and amazed at the quality of this Blu-ray edition of Season 1. I have only viewed the Pilot and the first 2 episodes but the resolution is so clear in my 50"" tv and sound is good. I was surfing through Amazon a few months ago and almost fell off my seat when I saw that a Deluxe Remastered Edition Blu-ray version of Little House Season 1 was going to be released with emphasis on ""better picture and sound quality."" To aid in enjoyment and further appreciation of the dialogue, there are wonderful English subtitles. Congratulations to the group who brilliantly thought of correcting a big mistake and an injustice made to the fans by releasing the Blu-ray versions. I can not wait for Season 2 to be released and will expect that the entire series will be released on Blu-ray including the telemovies. I also heard that the episodes are uncut versions (restored to broadcast length) so all the more that the people behind this effort should be commended for a job well done. This classic tv series has finally, after 40 years, been given the royal treatment it truly deserves with the Blu-ray versions. Thank you for giving me the wonderful privilege to revisit this classic series in spectacular Blu-ray!!!",1397433600,7,2615,4.3806584362139915

Laura tells Pa she and Olga were walking by Hanson's mill and Olga walked straight when walking on a plank. That scene is missing. I was disappointed I thought I was getting full uncut episodes. The reruns on tv are hacked to pieces, but still included that scene. There are scenes included that I haven't seen in syndication which is a plus.

6229831,4,B00HVFA39A,"""Little House on the Prairie"" has become an entertainment staple in my house. My wife began feverishly DVRing the show and trying to catch all the episodes in some semblance of order since running across it on GMC a couple of years back. Along the way, she sucked my sons into the family-oriented drama as well. She loves it so much I actually made a friend of mine drive 40 miles out of the way on a road trip so I could visit and take pictures of the Ingalls' homestead in Kansas for her. You can only imagine her excitement when it was announced they were releasing ""Little House on the Prairie: Season One & the Pilot Movie"" in a remastered deluxe edition Blu-ray that includes unedited versions of each episode and the pilot movie.

""Little House on the Prairie"" tells the story of Charles Ingalls and his family as they move to Kansas and then Minnesota to start a new life. They settle down in Minnesota and face many hardships as they build a home for themselves outside of the town of Walnut Grove. As they settle into the challenges of everyday life, they make friends and learn to deal with a colorful group of people who run and live in the the little community.

Longtime fans of ""Little House on the Prairie"" will be ecstatic over the release of the show in high-definition. Wonderfully restored with the clarity only Blu-ray can deliver, many might feel like they're viewing the episodes in a whole new light. The colors are better and the picture is cleaner than it's ever been in network airings.

Presented with a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 mono mix, ""Little House on the Prairie: Season One"" might not envelope the audience the way 5.0 surround sound does. However, it gets the point across and still heightens the experience beyond what you get watching it in cable or satellite syndication. You can't deny that it's the best the series has ever sounded.

Most ""Little House on the Prairie"" enthusiasts will be disappointed in the lack of bonus material offered on the Season One Blu-ray release. The first portion of a six-part look at the series is included. It runs a little over 14 minutes and is entitled ""The 'Little House' Phenomenon Part 1: A Place in Television History."" An original screen test featuring Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert is also featured. I can't believe they couldn't come up with some archival or new interviews with the cast and crew of the show to incorporate.

If you're looking for good clean family-friendly entertainment, ""Little House on the Prairie: Season One & the Pilot Movie"" is most definitely the answer to your prayers. It's a show that teaches the importance of family and the strength it provides to weather through the storms life throws at you. Any fan of classic television should clean off a spot in their home library for this new edition of the hit series.",1397260800,4,2827,4.668674698795181

It doesn't appear Lionsgate has pressed corrected blurays yet. I received a replacement copy and 'Family Quarrel' still has the incorrect subtitles. If subtitles are a necessity for you, you may want to hold off buying the the bluray for now or buy the dvd set. Subtitles on the new dvd set are all correct.
__________________________________________

I know subtitles are very important for many viewers and I did not see this mentioned in any review so I wanted to share a problem I found with the subtitles on the episode, 'Family Quarrel'.

On the Blu-ray edition, the subtitles used in 'Family Quarrel' are the same subtitles from the 'Christmas at Plum Creek' episode.  This error is not present on the new dvd edition of this set, only the Blu-ray.  You can call Lionsgate @ 1-877-230-2756 to report the problem.  Hopefully, if they received enough calls they will consider a replacement program for this disc.

That being said, I would not let this deter you from purchasing this wonderful set.  Lionsgate did a great job with the remastering.  It looks incredible and is a vast improvement over the original dvd set.  All of the episodes run 48-49 minutes long (except for the Pilot movie and 'The Lord is My Shepherd' which are double length)and appear to be uncut. Some viewers have mentioned small cuts from a couple episodes. I think the missing snippets may have been added when the show went into syndication and were not part of the original airing. Just my theory. If anyone out there remembers watching this when it first aired, chime in with your feedback.

The audio (English, Spanish, and French 2.0) is also an improvement. By no means would I use this to demonstrate my new sound system but the audio is clear and the pitch of the actors' voices are correct as the episodes are no longer sped up as in the previous dvd set.

I highly recommend this set and looking forward to Season 2.  I hope Lionsgate releases all the LHOTP seasons with this much care.  If you own the previous dvds and are on the fence about double-dipping with this one, trust me, sell the old set and buy this.  This is one double-dip that is really worth it.",1396742400,5,2170,4.676315789473684
6229834,5,B00HVFA39A,"I'm a huge fan of this classic series. I've own every DVD released and this is by far the best looking Little House I've ever seen, that includes all the HD channels on tv too. It almost looks like it was filmed just a few years ago, that's how good it looks. I don't see any defects throughout all the episodes. I noticed some scenes in the pilot that I have never seen before, so great they gave us everything that the Pilot had. Along with the pristine picture, the audio is also the best you've ever heard. I wouldn't normally suggest that any fan who has all the past Little House DVD's double dip and buy them again, but if you want a major remastered version of this beloved series, I highly recommend anyone to get this series. I hope and pray we see the rest of the seasons too. Michael Landon, we miss you, and we will continue to watch your amazing presence on the this amazing show.",1396569600,4,894,4.264705882352941
6229835,3,B00HVFA39A,"I just got my blue-ray copy of this set today.  After watching a few minutes of the episode ""Plague"", I was VERY disappointed!  It did NOT include the prelude and the preludes of the other episodes either after checking and it didn't have each one under extras either.  The original broadcast did in fact have these.  With this said, when it says unedited, uncut and as the original broadcasts, this is false advertising.  My wife said that they probably didn't think that it was any big deal or that the public wouldn't care about missing these, but as I say as a TV buff, if they didn't include these then it's NOT as the original broadcasts and it's NOT unedited as advertised.  I wish that somebody mentioned that because I probably wouldn't have gotten the set.  I don't care about reading a feedback on the program itself because if I want to look at that, I would go onto the Internet Movie Database to read about the show.  When I read feedback on Amazon, I want to know about the product itself whether or not it is as advertised, if it measures up to normal use, etc., not a critique of the show or movie itself or opinions on the brand of product.  Also it hisses a little bit as far as the audio is concerned which it didn't do on the original dvd set.  Isn't that a shame for a re-master??!!!",1396396800,4,1305,4.355371900826446

6229839,5,B00HVFA39A,"This is my favorite show ever and I've been waiting years for it to be remastered and released on Blu-ray.  I remember where I was when I heard about Michael Landon's death and I still get tears in my eyes when I think about it.  The picture quality of this release puts the old Imavision DVDs to shame and the sound is also much better.  There is tons of beautiful outdoor scenery in glorious HD, you can see what color the character's eyes are, and you can even clearly see Caroline's wedding ring in the opening as the wagon comes to a stop.

Season 1 has many classic episodes and the excellent pilot movie is also included in this release.  The episodes are broadcast at the proper speed here unlike the previous DVDs which were made from the syndication tapes where the episodes were sped up to make more time for commercials.  Try watching side by side and the old DVDs will get ahead every time due to being sped up.

I'm also glad Digital HD Ultraviolet copies are included.  I recommend redeeming your Digital HD Ultraviolet copy through Vudu which allows you to watch all the episodes in HD on computers, Roku players, smart TVs, smart phones, tablets and most Blu-ray players.

Yes, I already own the entire series on DVD...and yes the quality and content is horrific as everyone has stated. It was a huge disappointment.  So, when I discovered this blu-ray upgrade I was really optimistic.  I just really hope every fan shares my excitement and spreads the word...I will be buying the entire series again if the other seasons are in this beautiful, amazing, stunning, uncut, restored condition!  I also hope everyone knows how to tweak their tv settings to get the best picture.  Those who complain about the screen image (in general) on various reviews I've read here...I guarantee it's because you have no clue what all these new tv's can do...and how many setting options you have.  Tip:  Nearly all of the older shows (and some movies) were not filmed in widescreen!  So when played on your widescreen HDTV your image gets the black box treatment or is stretched edge to edge and looks crazy.  Go thru a few settings and ""voila!"" you instantly have that widescreen image that looks like everything current.  I also tend to adjust the vertical and horizontal (if you can) frequently to get the best picture possible for that specific thing you're watching.  And most tv's now have picture mode settings...standard, vivid, custom, movie, etc....don't be afraid to check them all out!  For Little House I recommend the ""vivid"" setting with a few tweaks to the color saturation and contrast.  You will be AMAZED.  I've noticed details in certain places that I never saw before!  It's like watching a whole new show!  Thank You Lionsgate for doing it up right!

6229848,5,B00HVFA39A,"When I first put in the discs to watch the show, I was hesitant.  I grew up watching the syndicated versions of this home on a Standard Definition Television.  I was worried that this would look too processed on Blu-ray with the trend of major studios to use Digital Noise Reduction technology.  Unfortunately this DNR technology leaves people looking waxy and fake compared to how the image originally looked.

Well my fears were put to rest after watching the Pilot movie and the first couple of episodes.  The video quality looks amazing and if I didn't know better, shots look as if they were filmed today.  Textures are amazing and the people look like people (wrinkles, freckles, hairs and all)!

For the price that I bought this for ($18 and change) I hope the studio is able to eek out a profit, because it will be amazing to have the entire series done with this level of love and quality.

We received it on the release date and after looking through the discs, they really did an excellent job of cleaning up the picture and the sound.
The picture is nice and sharp, the original length restored,

The image is unbelievably steady and clean.  There's signs this was accomplished with a lot of DNR, as some images come off a bit soft, but there's no doubt Little House has never looked better.  The sound...well...sounds like a 40 year-old television show.  Nothing's enhanced here.  It'll be fine on your television speakers.  If you have a big surround system, you'll feel its age a little more.

But what really surprised me is how the show sucked me right in.  I'd forgotten how charming a show this was, yet amazed at how well I remember specific scenes.  I seriously didn't think I'd get into this again at all, but I'm looking forward to revisiting the whole thing.

""Little House"" is a Midwestern treasure, finally getting a proper home release.  Let's see more HD releases of classic shows!",1395705600,9,1162,4.7164179104477615
6229851,5,B00HVFA39A,"Having bought all seasons of the previously released DVD's, I must say, this release is 1000% percent better.  Full episodes, brilliant clarity and vividness!  They did an excellent remastering job on this set.

As everyone is well aware, the initial DVD releases contained visually inferior and cut episodes.  I bought them all, because I loved the series and at least could watch them.  Fuzzy picture, scenes ending abruptly and missing scenes were what plagued the initial releases.  However, this Blu-Ray release corrects all that, at a great price.

I am looking forward to the rest of the series being released in this pristine quality. Hopefully, they will continue with this price range.

Excellent Job, Lion's Gate!",1395705600,18,724,5.181034482758621
6229852,5,B00HVFA39A,"I just received my copy through delivery. The first episode I tested was ""Town Party, Country Party"", since that was one of the first episodes I noticed was the syndicated version on DVD.

 I was excited over the original intro that is finally included. There was a scene that was cut in syndication, but I have now watched it for the first time in years! There was another scene in this episode that I do not remember watching, ever! Laura bathing outside the little house! This episode that was about 42 - 43 minutes in the DVD is 50 minutes in this Blu-ray!",1395705600,10,560,4.427184466019417
6229853,5,B00HVFA39A,"*contains a spoiler for anyone who may not have already seen these...  if you exist*

I hate how a person can rate something before it is released as we have yet to know the true quality of this release.  However, uncut and with the pilot episode as well sounds great to me.  I will likely buy the first four seasons or so and that's it.  Once Mary goes blind (to be honest, I forget exactly which season that was in), the show goes from a nice family friendly show about a struggling family to a show more concerned about pushing multiculturalism and other political agendas.  There are certainly a fair amount of good episodes in those later seasons, but plenty of awful ones as well.",1395619200,4,686,4.448

6229855,5,B00HVFA39A,Little House on Blu-ray? It's about time!! We have up to season three on DVD. I want the other seasons in our house asap but would rather purchase them on Blu-ray. I hope the wait for the entire series won't be very long :),1393977600,,223,4.090909090909091
6229856,3,B00HVFA39A,I love this show I grew up watching reruns thanks to my mom who also loves the show. I can not wait to see this in full HD and in original broadcast the way it was originally aired in NBC. How ever amazon price was at first $18 to preorder now it's $27? What's up with that. I preordered this from walmart who has it for $18. I suggest if you wanna pick this up preorder it from walmart they still have it for $18,1393545600,4,413,3.8705882352941177

8636433,5,B00HVFA39A,Do not  purchase if you plan on using the digital code because it expired on 3/2015. I was fortunate enough to watch it on a xbox. Why sell an expired code? Five stars for the series because picture and sound were excellent. I had forgotten how great the show really is . I also love how God is the center of their life and they always keep Him first. That's something very rare that you do not see on TV today.,1524873600,,411,4.074074074074074

This remastered Blu-ray is the ONLY way to watch Little House On The Prairie now, since the picture and sound have been restored for highest quality. Highly recommended.",1520726400,,304,5.224489795918367
8636435,5,B00HVFA39A,My seven year old daughter and I enjoy watching Little House on the Prairie.  The first season didn't disappoint.  The discs didn't seem to work at first as it took a long time to start.  Other than that we love the show.,1519430400,,221,4.214285714285714

8636437,5,B00HVFA39A,"WOW!  The picture on these discs is absolutely stunning.  My wife and I have an older DVD version of this season and the picture and sound does not look or sound anywhere near this good.  There's really no comparison.  The contrast has been dramatically improved upon. Colors are much more vibrant and the 'dull haze' look you'll likely remember in old TV re-runs is non-existent.  We're even hearing sounds we never really noticed before and its not because the sound wasn't there before but because the clarity of the sound makes you take notice.

The studio really cleaned this season up well.  The package is much more compact and sturdy too.  Thank you to the studio for giving this beloved series the respect it deserves.",1515024000,,727,4.76
