8661178,4,B00KSHOKO2,"Recently I watched (and reviewed here on Amazon) a Bluray titled A Swan Lake issued by the German Arthaus label. It was a modern version of Tchaikovskys ballet. Now comes another modern version of another of the three ballets that the composer wrote the music for (the third being Sleeping Beauty. This time it is The Nutcracker, but reimagined by the French choreographer Bouba Landrille Tchouba who specializes in hip-hop dance. It sure is different.

The original story  The Nutcracker and the Mouse King  was not the light and happy story that families flock to see at their local ballet company each Christmas season. Its much darker and stranger. Thats the concept here. There is also a minimalist staging with only cardboard boxes (sometimes enclosing the dancers) as scenery. The performance runs 70 minutes and uses both Tchaikovskys music and new music by Yvan Talbot that is often atonal.

I found the beginning slow going with not a lot of movement until the Tchaikovsky music kicked in. And it was interesting to see all the moves that I associate with break-dancing being performed slowly to the 19th century score. Talbots music uses a lot of simple percussion.

The camera work is great. The performance was recorded in HD for French TV.
I cant say I liked it as much as A Swan Lake but Im glad I saw it. As with other Arthaus DVDs, there is a 12 page booklet with liner notes in English, French and German and a few photos. There are no other special features on the BD, except for three trailers for other Arthaus productions.

If modern dance is of interest to you I think youll find this BD interesting. And  because there is so little Christmas in it, its appropriate all year round.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
