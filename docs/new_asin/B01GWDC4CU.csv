8764028,5,B01GWDC4CU,"Coined ""the performance of her career,"" was written way too early in Gillian Anderson's! However, she plays Lily Bart better than I can imagine anyone else ever attempting (should they dare). Set in 1900 NYC, Edith Wharton's ""tragic love story"" is more Lily Bart's tragic life story than not. The primary social issue dealt with is the hypocrisy of the aristocracy. I have something to add beyond the film itself that seems even more important: Gillian Anderson receives accolades for this performance, to be sure. As such, on the DVD there's a special feature of Anderson discussing in depth what her processes and techniques are for becoming a character and performing a role. The intimate details she reveals go well beyond the scope of this one film! As I listened to her talk about how she feels about her wardrobe and it's impact on her being in character, as she envisions that character and channels through herself that character, I had just finished viewing the entire 2013-16 series, ""The Fall,"" starring Gillian Anderson as DSI Stella Gibson ( a role she now claims was her favorite of all time, to date, anyway). Anderson's explications about and reflections on why she does this, or how she became that sent epiphanies shooting off like fireworks because her approaches to acting royally culminated par excellance when she played DSI Stella Gibson, over a decade later! That special feature on this DVD is worth so much more than anything anyone's ever written about Gillian Anderson's acting. It is a remarkable interview~",1503792000,,1537,4.98443579766537
