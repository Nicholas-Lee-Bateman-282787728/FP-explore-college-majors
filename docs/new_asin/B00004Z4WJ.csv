1381727,5,B00004Z4WJ,"This was hilarious!  I got this DVD for Christmas and my friends and I all watched it the night I got it and we laughed and laughed through the entire thing.  The New Orleans cast is my favorite by far and this was even better than any of the episodes from this season.  It has all of the roommates in different groups talking about stuff that happens and then going to clips of different things.  About 98% of it is stuff that you didn't see during the regular season.  As usual Melissa is the star and is so funny you just want to hang out with her all of the time.  Matt, who I wasn't a big fan of, was really funny on this.  Everyone else is great too.  This is definitely worth purchasing.  The extras on the DVD are OK but the content is good enough that you don't really care about the extra features that you usually get with DVDs.  I honestly laughed harder watching this than I have in a long, long time.  Of course you probably have to be a Real World fan to really enjoy this but if you are then this is a must have.",977788800,6,1028,4.064676616915423
1381728,4,B00004Z4WJ,"I recently got this video and it's great. It's very funny, and you get to see the opinions of all 7 people. I wasn't sure if I sure get this video but I'm glad I did!",977702400,,166,3.638888888888889
1381729,5,B00004Z4WJ,"Now being ""The Real World"" junkie that I am, I got this video almost the day it came out! However, I never thought it would be so hilarious! Melissa's impersonations of her parents, what really happend between David and Laterrian in Africa, etc. Everything on this tape is great! And you though Hawaii was good? Well, I'm telling you folks, this one is better! = )",973987200,8,364,4.53030303030303
1381730,4,B00004Z4WJ,"This movie is definitely worth the money.  You get some behind the scenes footage that is absolutely hysterical.  David's ""Come on be my baby tonight"" song....nuff said.  The only disappointing part was that the nudity, cursing, and obscene gestures were still blurred out...aw well.  Overall, a definite buy!",973468800,14,309,5.375
1381731,5,B00004Z4WJ,"This video is suprizingly hillarious! For real if you love this cast then this video NEEDS to be yours. Melissa and Julie are so funny that you will want to watch it over and over. Whoever cast these 7 people, did a brilliant job. BUY THIS VIDEO, it is worth it believe me!",973382400,9,273,4.169811320754717
1381732,4,B00004Z4WJ,"This video of extra scenes from the New Orleans cast is really pretty funny!  Although the cast hasn't been the best cast ever this year, they seem most real when they're setting up the funniest moments in this video.  Julie surprised me in this video. You get to see an even wilder side of her that you don't see much in the episodes on tv.  There are actually some surprises in this video with flirty segments on Danny & Kelley and Julie & Matt. Fans of Danny will be happy too because he gets a lot of attention on this video. I don't have the DVD but I think that it has a lot of extra stuff on it like clips from their casting tapes which would be cool. I highly recommend it!",971654400,39,681,4.105263157894737
1381733,5,B00004Z4WJ,"I dunno what you think, but real world new orleans is awesome!  I am definitely ordering this video.  I like this season the best out of all of them, because I can really relate to Matt in a lot of his ways.  But, thats about it. :P

1381734,5,B00004Z4WJ,These DVD show you the Real World New Orlean like never before. Go behind the scene and get the real on The Real World. See the thing that could not be shown on T.V. from fights to nudity. These is a must have for any Real World Fan. Even if you never seen The Real World you'll love it.,970704000,14,287,3.8813559322033897
1381774,5,B00004Z4WJ,"Hilarious from start to finish, and a must have for all Real World Fans. Shows once again why the RW9 cast was the most interesting and funniest Real World cast ever, it also helped to round out some of the characters who received less attention on the show, like Jamie and Matt. Melissa delivers more laughs in this tape than the funniest sitcom star, Kelley is at her beautiful best, Danny and Julie are people with personality plus. You will watch this one time and time again, and find yourself wishing that they could bring the whole bunch back for another season.",1032998400,,569,4.588235294117647
1381775,5,B00004Z4WJ,"This is without a doubt the funniest hour I have ever seen in my life. RW9 was my favorite cast, and this is now my favorite DVD. The funniest parts centered on Melissa, whom I think should get her own show and despite the lame extras, the DVD is definitely a great comedy for any fan of RW9.",1029196800,,292,4.051724137931035
1381776,5,B00004Z4WJ,"If u like the real world, or just real world 9 you will love this dvd. Makes you lauf so hard, I cant stop watching it. Defenatly worth every penny. Take a trip back into the real world season 9, makes you rember the highlights of the season. The only bad thing about it is you will want more.",1020643200,2,293,3.983050847457627
1381777,5,B00004Z4WJ,"A must have for a die-hard realworld fan. Possibly the best cast so far, New Orleans you never saw will make you laugh uncontrollibly and make you wish you were there. Melissa, Danny, Kelley, Julie, Matt, Jamie, and David will let you see a side you've never seen before.",1015977600,2,271,4.551020408163265
1381778,5,B00004Z4WJ,"The problem with most reality programming is that they don't ground their shows in reality.  They always devise a theme to place them outside of everyday challenges, be they sent to boot camp, on a love cruise, or on a desert island to eat the vermin of the tropics.
This is where the Real World comes in handy; free from such marketing gimmicks, the show displays human relationships, character dynamics, and the honest emotions of its various casts in a show that's okay to love, because none of it is fiction.  Presented here is the show's greatest season, more diverse, better developed, and just plain more intriguing than the constant squabbling of the other seasons (a flaw in the program not present in the New Orleans season).  Julie is a woman of newfound wisdom; watching her grow and thrive with the lessons of the experience is a constant pleasure, as she is never as innocent as she appears.  Melissa is always a treat, never afraid to speak her mind and, just as often, her body.  Matt's devout adherence to his Catholic faith did not prevent him from enjoying the diversity and wisom of his roommates or the experience itself.  David, a loner, held great ambition in his silence, and a dedication to his ill mother back home.  Jamie, smug but lovable, learned much about seeing value in others, and himself.  Best of all was Danny, a man of warmth and wisdom, whose loving relationship with military boyfriend Paul, his quietly powerful love for roommate Kelly, and his teaching of Julie about the truths of his orientation revealed a far more complex person than the stereotypical effeminate, promiscuous image of gay men held in common prejudice.  Yes, the show is something for MTV to be proud of, not only true reality, but deeply felt as well.
The DVD release decides to take the humorous route, and it is truly juicy material, both human and hilarious at once.  The entire feature is filled to bursting of laugh-out-loud sequences of moments both embarrassing and revealing, including Kelly and Danny's uncommon familiarity with each other (Adam and Eve were never this insatiable), Melissa's painfully funny commentary on sex, her body, and her parents (Mercy is profoundly remeniscent of the mother Margaret Cho made famous).  The inclusion of the cast members' audition tapes make this a terrific package, a must for fans of the show.
Just don't abuse the On-star people like that.",1004227200,2,2406,4.872549019607843
1381779,5,B00004Z4WJ,"I didn't expect to laugh so hard when I started watching The Real World You Never Saw - New Orleans. Most of the footage is hilarious stuff that happened in and out of the Belfort that may have been considered too ""risqu"" for television. Melissa's antics contribute to most of the funniness, but we also see a wilder side of Matt and Julie.
 The cast is separated into three groups (Matt & David, Kelly & Danny & Julie, and Jamie & Melissa), and they look back over some of the crazy times they had while we are treated to footage of those crazy times. We also get to see the much-talked about and much-""mimic""ed parents of Melissa. And they are just as hilarious as Melissa. There are about 3 other scenarios with Melissa that are very comedic.
 The bonus stuff on the DVD is mostly information on the cast. Short 2-3 minute clips from their audition tapes and sessions are given. Except, for some reason, Melissa. Instead, we see her trying on a huge pair of underwear and strutting around the house. She's wild. There's also a tour of the Belfort Mansion, a promo for The Real World You Never Saw - Hawaii, and a segment on How to Audition for The Real World which is hosted by Amaya from Real World Hawaii.
 The New Orleans cast is my favorite from The Real World casts because of their diversity, humor, and drama. This disc really expanded the humor part. It's a must-have for Real World fans. The book companion for the New Orleans cast and soundtrack are also must-haves.",995500800,6,1479,4.4907063197026025
1381780,3,B00004Z4WJ,"The video is very funny, however for those seking to see the nude seens that were censored on the show, this video has no nudity in it.",994204800,6,135,4.037037037037037
1381781,5,B00004Z4WJ,"Although the video focuses on the New Orleans crew, this video also contains some clips from past series.  New footage is shared along with member's outlook on thier experience.  You get to meet Mellisa's parents along with some other clips.  To me it was not long enough, but all true RW fans will appriciate.  If you did not folllow the series, you may not get alot out of the video.",983836800,2,385,4.457142857142857
1381782,3,B00004Z4WJ,"Overall I liked the cast of REAL WORLD NEW ORLEANS a lot, so I had high hopes for this DVD. After viewing it, I liked the cast even more, but I was disappointed with the DVD.
First, the good stuff:
1. There are a lot of funny moments on this DVD. The ones that come to mind are the funny (and sexy) Adam and Eve spoof Danny and Kelley did, Melissa's prank phone call to phone star, and the various cast members teasing David with their own versions of ""Come On Be My Baby Tonight."" (Did anyone but me ever notice that David ripped this song off from ""Guys and Dolls?"")
2. I also liked the bonus footage of the cast members' audition tapes. We saw bits of this during the casting special, but the DVD provided a lot more.
Here are my gripes:
1. The stuff on there was good, but there wasn't nearly enough of it. This drove me crazy. Not including the bonus stuff, the DVD wasn't even an hour long. It cost way too much for so little. The production company had thousands of hours of tape to draw material from. Why not make the DVD four hours long? I'm sure there'd be no problem filling it with interesting stuff, and it wouldn't even cost them anything extra because the footage already exists. There was no reason for this DVD to be so short.
2. Some of this stuff was so good that I can't believe they left it out of the actual series. For example, in the show, much time was given to Melissa's impressions of her parents. Unless you've viewed the DVD, you'd never know that Melissa's parents came to visit her in New Orleans. Yes, we got to meet the often-imitated Mercy and Shorty. They were fun, and I definitely wanted to see even more of them.
3. The box said that the DVD contained 100% new material. Although the vast majority of it was new, it wasn't all new. That's a minor gripe.
Summary: Overall, I liked what was on there, but I didn't feel like I got enough for what I paid.",979084800,28,1890,4.238227146814404
1381783,3,B00004Z4WJ,"This is a fun look-back at the Real World - New Orleans.  As others have mentioned,  this is not an ""uncensored"" video -- but merely ""unseen"" footage as the cast reminisces about their stay at the Belfort mansion.  The cast was clearly much more relaxed and showed their sense of humor (particularly Matt and David who were a little more guarded during the show and are paired together as a ""team"") in the DVD.  The true ""star"" of this DVD (and the entire series) is Melissa.  She will make you laugh until you are almost crying -- even in her melodramatic moments.  The call to On Star (vehicle global positioning assistance) as she imitates her mother is particularly hilarious.
The ""bonus"" features are a bit lame -- a slide-show tour of Belfort and advertisements for Real World-Hawaii and ""How to Audition"" for the Real World.  There are snippets from the cast auditions tapes that are a bit more interesting.  My only complaint is that the entire DVD (only 55 minutes) IS just ""bonus"" material.  In this age of jam-packed DVDs, it would have been nice to have the entire series (especially to catch up on those episodes you may have missed) and what is on this DVD presented as the extra ""bonus"" material.  One thinks just Melissa outtakes could have filled an hour's worth of material.  Overall, an enjoyable DVD for fans of the series and particularly this cast which I felt was one of the best groups over the past several Real World seasons.",978307200,9,1451,4.650980392156863

7928211,5,B00004Z4WJ,"This is by far the best edition of ""Real World You Never Saw.""  As an unashamed life-long watcher, I have followed the ""seven strangers"" through the different cities and situations for years.

However, this ""Real World You Never Saw"" is side-splittingly funny and a must-see for any fan.

So many of the replayed moments had me in hysterics, and I have to say that Melissa is so funny that I would watch her dealing with the situations of her own life by herself.  Her impersonations and her call to OnStar are the highlights of the video.

Definitely check this out- you won't be disappointed.",1171670400,,594,4.673076923076923
7928212,4,B00004Z4WJ,"New Orleans was one of the best seasons so far of The Real World and this DVD is almost in retrospect a tribute to the city as it was before Katrina changed so much. These clips are both a reintroduction to the 1999 season of TRW and a revealing look at some of the mountain of footage that must wind up  figuratively on the cutting room floor. Julie, the virginal Mormon girl later suspended from BYU for being on TRW of course stole the show that season, but  it's the other cast members who seem to shine in this accompaniment to one of the original and longest-running ""reality"" shows on television.",1159833600,,603,4.423423423423423
