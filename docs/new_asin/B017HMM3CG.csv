THE FILM - [ 2.5 / 5 ]:

At a local Catholic school, the nuns have noticed that the priest is doing more than just leading his students in prayer. Not content to stand idly by as evil walks their halls, the Sisters decide to take action. Confronted by the nuns about his wicked ways, the priest retaliates. For defying him, the Father takes the Sisters hostage and bricks them into the walls of the school's basement. The sadistic and fatal punishment shakes the faith of the women, forcing them to renounce their holy vows in the moments before their demise. How could they continue to believe in a power that would allow them to suffer such a fate when they were merely trying to do what's right?

Decades later, the school is now vacated and in a state of disrepair. Selected by the community as a building marked for urban renewal, a neighborhood youth group has volunteered their afternoon to come clean up the premises and prepare it for construction. However, when the motley crew accidentally uncovers the blasphemous tomb in the basement, the nuns return...and Hell follows. Trapped inside the building, the members of the youth group fight for their lives to flee the wronged nuns, who now lurk the halls as damned Sisters of perdition. All the while, the school itself starts twisting and distorting, becoming a mad nightmare that just may prove to be a gateway to a world beyond. With blood on their hands and revenge on their minds, the nuns won't stop until they have...FLESH FOR THE INFERNO!

""Flesh for the Inferno"" was made in 2015 by Scorpio Film Releasing and you can learn more about them via Facebook and Twitter. It is a low budget indie film but don't let that scare you off. The film is better than most similar fare. No, you don't see the credits filled with big name cast or crew members but it is still a quality film. The film gives us some nuns who are hellbent after a deadly betrayal. This isn't a nunsploitation type film though as you won't find any voluptuous nuns busting out of their clothes. There are some pretty ladies in the film though so all is not lost. Just don't expect to see much skin. In its place we do have an assortment of blood, guts, Fulci-inspired eye gouging (via the crew commentary) and more to keep the viewers entertained. Along with a 76 minute run time, we have a film that moves along at a good pace.

I liked the way we get a little bit of information on the soon to be endangered youth shortly in to the film as they get to know one another after arriving at the derelict school. While it may not be an abundance of background on each character, it's something and in a genre of cannon fodder characters, I appreciated the effort. ""Flesh for the Inferno"" features some good quality practical effects as well. Early on in the film there was a bad CGI effect and I immediately said ""ugh"" aloud fully expecting the worst. Now the immediate practical effect didn't impress me a whole lot either but I was still reeling from the CGI. Thankfully the practical effects got better and were quite enjoyable.

AUDIO - [ 3.5 / 5 ]:

This DVD comes with an English Dolby Digital 2.0 audio track. Despite being a low budget independent film, I found the audio quality to be fairly impressive. Sound levels remain consistent throughout the film and it is fairly well balanced. I did not have any trouble hearing the dialogue as it was clear. The music and sound effects were represented well also. I particularly enjoyed the music that plays during the films title and opening credits.

VIDEO - [ 3.5 / 5 ]:

""Flesh for the Inferno"" comes to DVD thanks to MVD Entertainment Group. The film is in the NTSC format with a 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio. The video quality is very good however it was processed to give it a film-like appearance with occasional white specks and some digital noise to appear like film grain. This is not to the degree of ""Planet Terror"" though, instead being very slight. At least one special lens was used as well, which is mentioned in the crew commentary, that helped to diffuse the picture. So while it still looks like a recently made movie, it does have a vague feeling of an older film. Color-wise, they look good and at times remind me of what the color of most 70's films look like as in slightly drab. At other times, as in the case of Claudette's outfit, some colors are quite strong. Skin tones and the black levels looked alright as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 2.5 / 5 ]:

Crew Commentary - The participants for this track are director/editor Richard Griffin, writer Michael Varrati, assistant director Mark Hutchinson and producer Ted Marr. One of the first things mentioned is that the film was shot at the brisk pace of nine days. A fair amount of the conversation is scene related as the cast, characters and crew members are mentioned. Listeners are able to learn a lot about the production of the film including some talk about effects, equipment, script, and locations. This was both an informative and fun commentary.

Cast Commentary -  Director/editor Richard Griffin is joined by stars Jamie Dufault, Anna Rizzo and Jamie Lyn Bagley. Mr. Griffin sort of serves as moderator for this track asking the stars how the became involved in the film. He is definitely the dominant voice for this track which is kind of unfortunate only because it would have been nice to hear more from the actors other than comments or replies here and there.

IN CONCLUSION:

A fun indie horror film with some good looking practical effects and blood. The DVD features above average audio and video and includes a pair of commentary tracks. If you are a fan of indie horror, I'd suggest giving this one a spin.

7505152,4,B017HMM3CG,"From the crazy team who brought us Sins of Dracula comes another low-budget campy horror film. Though a very serious history sets all the satanic shenanigans in motion, the movie manages to maintain a sense of fun throughout. This falls somewhere on the B-horror spectrum between Troma and David DeCocteau. I dug it!",1464825600,,316,4.981132075471698
7505153,2,B017HMM3CG,"With such a small budget what can you expect?
There were too many characters (the policemen and the prostitute could easily have been left out).
None of the actors stood out for me as talented performers or interesting characters.
The dialogue was good for a tongue-in-cheek horror comedy.
I will try to check out some of the director's other movies to see if he ever
has gotten to the level of the Italian masters at their best, all of
whom probably made low budget movies similar to this.
Does anyone know what movie the Title ""Flesh for the Inferno"" alludes to.
Maybe the horror-comedy ""Flesh for Frankenstein"".",1463011200,,614,4.747663551401869
7505154,5,B017HMM3CG,"First off, I am a Richard Griffin fan, so I am definitely biased.  The man can do more on a couple of thousand dollars than Hollywood does with millions.  This will bring you back to the great Italian Religious-themed horror flicks of the 70s and 80s.  It is much darker spirited than a lot of Mr. Griffin's other films, the exceptions being Exhumed and Normal, but they aren't your typical horror flicks, much more cerebral than visceral like this.  There is blood and gore a-plenty.  The plot involves a Youth Group that has arrived at an old orphanage to clean up the building for renovation, only to find that it is haunted by the spirits of a trio of nuns that were killed trying to stop a perverted priest.  Anna Rizzo gives a standout performance.  Jill Poisson's photography is beautiful, evoking the best of the Bava/Fulci/Argento masterpieces.  Well worth the few bucks it will cost you to buy this disc.",1462147200,,914,4.66875

7505156,1,B017HMM3CG,"DO NOT WATCH THIS. A $300 budget, a group of chunky 20-somethings with overbites and bad haircuts masquerading as teens, clunky dialogue read at the halting pace of middle-school theatre, a recipe of chocolate sauce and Karo syrup standing in for blood, characters reacting to things a beat before they happen in one-take fiascos, and camera work that mistakes closeups for drama, all combine in the worst film ever made. Plotless, pointless and purile, it's impossible to discern whether the director/writer was going for camp or Italian Giallo homage. I only hope this review convinces would-be viewers how low-budget and awfully written this thing is, how bad the so-called acting is, and how badly acquitted the directing and editing is! Wish I could get my $2.95 back!",1459641600,3,773,5.094488188976378

7505158,4,B017HMM3CG,"Indie Horror needs a Richard Griffin, it needs that personality that throws fun and thought into this genre. His low budget films have the same heart that we have come to see in Roger Cormans earlier works. The man has really taken on every element in the spectrum when it comes to directing, so why not come back to religion. The film opens in 1999, when Prince was partying and the internet was in fear of crashing, and we meet a group of nuns. The nuns they confront this bad priest who loves to touch the little altar boys at the Catholic school. So, Father Renault pulls a gun and shoots one of the nuns in the head and forces the other three to go into the basement, where he bricks them up inside this space. The nuns lose their faith when this fate is bestowed to them, so they renounce God and make a pact with Satan swearing their souls to the master. We fast forward to 2015, a youth group arrive to do some clean up. Once inside, they stumble upon the bricks were the nuns were holed up and soon enough, the nuns are out for their souls. Only Richard Griffin could pull this film off so excellent.

The film does have its pacing flaws and some of the acting is not up to par, but this film has such a fun vibe and does get a little in the gore department to make those gripes at bay for the most part. This film has such a fun spirit that I found myself smirking or laughing at times. That is the one thing that Richard and his crew never fail on, dialogue. They always put so much thought into what they want their characters to come across like, and at times it does feel redundant if you are a fan of his past films, but it still has fun. The gripe I have, I would love to see what Griffin could do if a studio gave him a budget and a vision for him to work with. Where I feel most directors fail from indie to major, I feel Richard could be the one to really give us that film to get people wanting to check out his past works after they are blown away. This film doesnt overstay its welcome, and really for the most part was entertaining and dare I say, thought provoking. I would recommend not only this film, but also his whole Library, the man is really such a talent that I feel people are being robbed when they do not seek out his work.",1459123200,,2259,4.110859728506787

7505161,2,B017HMM3CG,"The effects denoted on the ""dvd"" cover is as close to real effects as you will get.  Mostly a little black makeup around the eyes to denote an evil Nun...  Very campy and low budget, some laughs; but overall I wish I had not had wasted the money to rent it.  On the good side, at least I did not buy it!",1458000000,,303,3.8548387096774195
7505162,4,B017HMM3CG,"Flesh for the Inferno is the latest film from Scorpio Film Releasing and the wonderful director Richard Griffin.  Teaming up with screenwriter Michael Varrati again (The Sins of Dracula) and many of the terrific Scorpio Films regulars, I expected more of the usual comedy horror the troupe has entertained us with for years.

Only a few minutes in I was reminded that just as often Griffin has chosen to play it straight, with movies like Normal and Exhumed.  Flesh for the Inferno is more of a cross between the two; some 80s-style horror combined with the well-timed sarcasm and humor that elevate Scorpio Films from some of the other independent horror flicks out there.  In the process, we get a tip of the hat to such varied chillers as A Cask of Amontillado and the original Evil Dead.

As is often the case, they waste no time and jump right into the fun.  The great Michael Thurber brings his Catholic youth group to a run-down Catholic school, which years earlier had been the scene of both molestations and the cruel murder of a group of nuns.  The teens are there to clean up some of the mess before construction crews arrive on a future date to begin renovations.  Little do they know they are soon to encounter the vengeful nuns, who have pledged their souls to Satan in exchange for revenge.

Many of the Scorpio regulars appear. Jamie Lyn Bagley is Meredith, an over-pious snide group leader.  Jamie Dufault is Noah, Michael Thurbers nephew who happened to visit during church group weekend; lucky him.  We even get appearances from Sarah Nicklin as a soap-opera-obsessed prostitute and Aaron Andrade aswell, as a rather evil individual.

The real powerhouse in this movie is Anna Rizzo as Kat.  Granted, she gets some of the meatier scenes and best lines, but if she couldn't handle them theyd be wasted.  She quickly jumps back and forth between terror and sarcasm with ease.  Jamie Lyn Bagleys character also is fun to watch, and Michael Thurber beings the skills he always does.  Thurber is truly a talent; whether hes playing Dr. Frankenstein, Dracula, or a role that requires more nuances he always seems to hit the nail on the head.  Here he walks the tightrope of friendly, upbeat, pious and throws in just a hint of uncomfortable creepiness.  Too much of any of these ingredients would cause him to lose his balance and fall to the ground below, but as always he crosses safely.  Scorpio is lucky to have him.

The effects are much gorier than many of Griffins films, and rather well done.  I found the possessed character who bashed its head over and over into a window until the entire face was flattened to be deliciously gruesome and disturbing.  Something else that happens with that body soon afterwards confirmed my suspicion that it may have been homage to The Evil Dead.

There are some of the usual running jokes Ive grown to expect and enjoy in most of Griffins films.  Theres a gag about whether one of the characters is gay, another about whether people are REALLY sure a corpse was dead, and theres a character who spends half his time assuming every female wants to have sex with him and the other half fascinated with banging pots and pans together in the kitchen.  Varrati keeps the humor tight and intelligent, but not to the point of taking himself (or the characters) too seriously.

Richard Griffin has managed to avoid the trap he set for himself when he built his reputation from early successes like Pretty Dead Things and the masterpiece Disco Exorcist.  Instead of going Troma and making every film formulaic, he continues to vary his choices and experiment with different flavors.  Like a great wine or a delicate perfume, his films have a variety of aromas and ingredients.  He has his favorites which help identify his signature, but even they can be moved around to a new level within the finished product.  I look forward to the upcoming Accidental Incest and Seven Dorms of Death to see what new concoctions he has cooked up.",1457913600,,3981,4.719247467438495
7505163,4,B017HMM3CG,Imagine if you combined the cheap films of Ed Wood with the pure terror of Suspira and House by the Cemetery and then turned all that into Carpenter's Prince of Darkness. You would have Flesh for the Inferno. Arguably this film is nowhere near the brilliance of the for mentioned films but it's still of good quality for it being cheap Fulci esque fun.,1457481600,2,352,4.515625
7505164,3,B017HMM3CG,"Silly, occasionally amusing horror comedy about a bunch of high school students (who appear to be well into their twenties) who are cleaning up a closed Catholic school prior to its renovation--which actually makes no sense.  Who is going to clean up a building before the construction crews come in?  What would be the point?

In any case, the film opens with very little promise--a cheaply shot, poorly acted scene in which three nuns accuse a priest of sexual abuse.  The priest responds by walling the nuns up in the school, causing them to make a pact with Satan to get revenge.  The scene calls to mind the movies of Bill Zebub (Zombiechrist; Forgive Me For Raping You) whose films tend to have budgets in the $5,000.00 range.

The movie jumps forward in time the present day when the school has been closed for years and a group of students from a Christian after school group (only one of whom actually seems religious) have volunteered to clean up the school.  One of them rips out a brick where the nuns were walled in---big mistake.  The evil nuns spend the rest of the movie picking off the students in various gory ways.

On the one hand, the filmmakers clearly want this to be a love letter to Italian horror films by Lucio Fulci, Lamberto Bava, Ruggero Deodato and the like--but they simply don't have the budget resources to get the look or feel of those films right.  On the other hand, Flesh For The Inferno is a horror comedy rather than a straight gore flick and a surprisingly high percentage of the jokes and gags are actually funny.  The movie is probably even funnier if you happen to be drunk or stoned while watching it--just saying.

Flesh For The Inferno is an agreeably silly horror comedy that makes the most of its limited budget and offers enough in the way of laughs and gore to please fans of the genre, providing they don't mind the lack of polish and are just looking for some goofy, time-wasting fun.",1457222400,,1937,4.566473988439307
7505165,1,B017HMM3CG,Just another B rated movie. Someone gave it a 4 star. Don't bother.,1457222400,,67,4.230769230769231
7505166,3,B017HMM3CG,"Pretty decent indie film, I admire anyone who can make a film its a lot of work. This is good for a watch, But id rent it first before I buy it, I liked it enough to keep in my collection.",1456963200,4,188,3.6097560975609757
7505167,5,B017HMM3CG,"Flesh for the Inferno is the latest macabre film from the twisted minds of Richard Griffin and Scorpio Films Releasing. The film was written by the equally twisted mind of Michael Varrati. The film is an homage to the extremely dark European films of Fucci, Argento, and Franco. The story centers around 3 nuns (played by Samantha Acampora, Tiffany Lee Ferris, and Monica Saviolakis) who confront the priest (played by the extremely villainous Steven O'Broin I mean this guy has to be evil he's so good at villainy). The nuns are overpowered by the priest ad he walls them yup in the school. There they pledge themselves to Satan and become rage personified. Fast forward several years and a church group (not really sure if they're Catholic or Protestant) are at the school which has been closed for many years and is in the hands of a janitor/caretaker named Halsey (played by Sean Leser). They are here to clean the place up a little before construction crews come in to repair and reopen the school. They of course release the nuns who wreak havoc on them. The church group (led by theater great and Scorpio veteran Michael Thurber) run the mix from the extremely uber religious (played brilliantly by Jamie Lynn Bagley) to the less uber but are there because Mom made them (led by Anna Rizzo who is the main heroine of the film). Great performances by Jamie Dufualt (with a partial beard no less), Ryan Nunes, Laura Mindadeo, Kevin Michael Straus, Jaquelyn Fabian,  and Andrew Morais. The film is not the regular comedic horror which has been Scorpio's staple style but instead is a dark and disturbing film more in the vein with Normal than Murder University. There are some light moments (almost entirely provided by local PD played by Andrew Andrade and Rich Tretheway with Srah Nicklin as their guest in the back seat of their squad car). There is another great performance but I don't want to give it away as it's a surprise in the 3rd act. The film has a lot in it and has great special effects by Jordan Pacheco. The film has a nice steady pace that steadily increases as things start happening. Well worth your investment especially if you are a big fan of micro budget films like me and yes I know the film makers personally as I have been a fan of Scorpio for quite a long time (as anyone who sees my reviews will see).",1456963200,3,2334,4.597122302158273
7505168,5,B017HMM3CG,"This is one hell of a good flick!!

A group of high school kids (Note: Groups of people in horror movies NEVER make it intact to the end.......EVER.......) are tasked with cleaning up an abandoned catholic school that's slated for demolition (An abandoned building in a horror movie is NOT a good thing).

Some years before, the nuns catch the priest in an act of supreme evil, and decide to take revenge.  For this, the priest enacts his revenge.  He takes the sisters hostage and bricks them up in the walls of the school's basement.  Moments before they meet their unholy demise, the sisters renounce their vows and pray for revenge.

When the group of high school kids begins the cleanup, all hell (literally) breaks loose and glorious carnage ensues.  Will anyone make it out alive?  Just what is in store???  What surprises does the madness hold?  Watch this movie and find out!!

One of the many things I enjoyed about this movie is that it's a love letter to those italian grindhouse flicks I grew up watching when I was younger.  This one immediately brings you back to that period in time.  Another wonderful aspect of this one is that it's a take no prisoners (aka spares no one) kind of movie.  And, in my book, that makes it a must see!!!

I had one hell of a great time with this movie and you will too!  Do yourself a favor and check it out!!  Also, do NOT forget to check out the director's body of work!!",1456876800,5,1421,4.445736434108527

7505170,5,B017HMM3CG,"The story for FLESH FOR THE INFERNO runs like this: when a child lover of a priest (you inferred correctly) bricks up some nuns in a churchs walls, they take it upon themselves to renounce God. You can guess how that works out well, I mean you don't really have to guess... that happens in like the very begin-- damn it, Ive gone off the rails again. I told them to let me continue those morphine drips... Anyway, before ya know it, a group of attractive gaggle of youth groupers come to clean up the church, which of course results in these demon nuns goin absolutely Donkey Kong on everyone once they are set free.

While a good portion of Richards work in the horror biz has been delivered with a fair share of tongue in cheek among the carnage, FLESH FOR THE INFERNO proves to be another beast all together. Its bloody, vicious, and a real knockout of a fright flick. Unlike the snarky THE EDITOR, this film proves to be a real love letter to the spaghetti splatter flicks of yore. The lighting is both parts Bava and Fulci, the subject matter is much the same (as is the score for that matter), and all of it is delivered with a true appreciation of the genre. And as always, Griffin understands how to make a perfect grind house flick: keep it short, keep it bloody, and keep it movin!

I highly recommend FLESH FOR THE INFERNO to any and all fans of Italian horror; its the flick you want to exist when you say They just don't make them like that anymore!, cuz believe you me tiger, youll hit the jackpot with this one!",1456876800,4,1526,4.3321678321678325
