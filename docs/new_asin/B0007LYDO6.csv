2219573,5,B0007LYDO6,This is one of the best india's films i have ever seen,1163030400,5,54,3.5833333333333335
2219574,4,B0007LYDO6,"Let's start by saying one of the most critical thing about most bollywood films are horrid unexplained quick conclusions. The end of Veer Zara was a drag and there was a bit too much sympathy that the director wanted to derive out of the courtroom scenes. I think this is done in a bid to win over audiences from all over the country.

Now,until the first half Veer Zara managed to create such a strong impact on my heart that it's quiet difficult to comprehend. Punjab is shown with more overglowing passion than ever before in this film. A girl from Pakistan falls in love with an Indian pilot blah blah...there's not much in the story although I think there were excellent short performances by bollywood greats like Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini.

It is Shahrukh's superhuman side that wins my heart and his performance outshines anything I could possibly like/dislike about Veer Zara. Preity Zinta has acted better than what she did in this film. Rani Mukherji didn't deserve the award she got.

It's funny how most Indian films tend to rub it in by over emphasising on things that don't matter. For one ,it's Rani's dedication to her job as lawyer. Secondly,I felt Shahrukh looks horrendous as an old man as he is not the kind of man to ever lose his youth.

I'll stop talking now. Let me repeat once again,you will not be disappointed by this film. SRK acts in this film with a certain wave of dedication and over-refreshing enthusiasm I've never seen from him before.

With All Due Respect,this film has a dragging ending making it more predictable. Some of my favourite scenes in the film are -

When SRK declares his love for Zara(PZ) for the first time at the railway station,the conversation between Mrs. Kher and PZ where she tries to be a good mother and talk about love to her daughter. Without a crop of doubt, the scene where SRK reads out his overdramatic poetry to a crowd (towards the end of the film) made me go weak.

Overall I'd give this film a 7.8/10

It's definitely better than ""Swades"" or the overly overdramatic ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai""

Enjoy!",1161734400,,2072,4.608695652173913
2219575,5,B0007LYDO6,This film exceeded all expectations. The music was hauntingly beautiful and extremely current despite being written so long ago. SO GLAD THAT THE MOVIE PRODUCERS DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE INDUSTRY PUNDITS! Scenery and costumes were breathtaking. Last but not least the actors were flawless and moving.,1153180800,6,296,5.456521739130435
2219576,4,B0007LYDO6,"I sat down to watch this film with rather low expectations. I mean, sure, it was backed up by heavy star power, like the unfailing Shahrukh Khan, and the excellent Amitabh Bachan, but I didn't expect the film itself to be good. However, this was a beautiful masterpiece, and I must say Yash Chopra has pulled off another splendid film! My only two complaints were that the film tended to drag at some parts, and there was one song (but only one) that bored me a little. Overall, it is a nice film, and should be watched if you have the patience and time. The plot was good, and the romance was not overdone (like in many Hindi films). The main theme song is also rather catchy, and you'll find yourself humming it after you've watched the movie. There is no violence in this film, and it's good for the whole family (I mean that)!",1150243200,31,830,4.361290322580645

2219578,5,B0007LYDO6,King Khan and Preity Zinta show a wonderful performance.  Many reviews complain about things like accents being wrong or if one was even able to cross the border 22 years ago. This film is touching and if you don't care about those kinds of things or don't understand those rivalries it is even more exceptional!!,1135296000,5,313,4.6909090909090905
2219579,4,B0007LYDO6,"Before viewing this movie, I had never been privy to a ""Bollywood"" film.  I'm your typical ""whiteboy"" so this genre of film was quite new to me.  The first things to take into account (for ""whiteboys"" like myself) are the length of the movie, bollywood films tend to run longer than american films (no worries though, there's an ""intermission""), the other attribute is that this film as with most bollywood films I've learned, incorporate song into the film.  Hence, they have more of a ""show"" feeling to them.  It's kind of corny at times, because the actors don't actually do the singing.  When the scene suddenly goes into song and the vocal voice is significantly different than the actor/actress's voice it's quite noticable, but that's how things are done and you just have to get used to it.

Overall, Veer Zaara was actually a quite wonderful film, the story is solid and heartfelt, the cinematography is wonderfully done, the acting is superb, and the songs are quite beautiful and catchy (I now have the soundtrack, and listen to it often).  This for me, was a wonderful introduction into the genre, and I will seek out more similar movies to view, due to this particular film.

The hardest thing for me was getting past the cheese of the actors during the musical numbers.  This is the american in me speaking when I say that I'd probably prefer the songs in the background during scenes, rather than the actors lip-synching to them, but I can definitely get used to that.

I guess in closing, if you are a die-hard fan of Bollywood, or a novice like me, you will enjoy this film.  it's a great story, with wonderful actors, spectacular sets/locations, and the music sets the mood perfectly for each scene.  I own it now, and that should at least be motive enough to see it when you have the chance.",1123891200,10,1810,4.639498432601881
2219580,5,B0007LYDO6,"Curious, I rushed into a Bollywood DVD rental shop and asked the clerk to recommend a few. She immediately handed me this one. I can see why.

This movie introduces us to Veer, a man imprisoned unjustly in prison for twenty-two years, and Somayya, his young, beautiful lawyer trying to get him out. Veer tells Somayya his story of why he's there. It's long, yet beautiful, touching, poignant, and emotional.

Throughout the film, marvelous song-and-dance numbers are interspersed (My favorite song- ""Lado""), making the viewer want to ""get theeself to Indian dance lessons.""

Lastly, the movie leaves a few lessons on the viewer's mind. The first, what is a border, but a line drawn on a map? The second, what is life without love?

Enjoy!!!",1122854400,58,740,4.896

A masterpiece of a movie like only Yash Raj (Yash Chopra) Films makes; makes you wish there were a 100 more movies of this quality beyond those made by this company; the truly golden days of Indian cinema which is changed so much recently that it makes this movie a true classic. Seeing it again a year later and a year after that it's still as poignantly beautiful and vibrant as it was the first time around. Though some of the subject matter is quite sad, it's always interspersed with such an engaging and beautiful story throughout which has tremendous joy in much of the movie also; so full of heart . Beautiful cinematography, great acing. It feels true to life and with a message of humanity in it. Shahrukh Khan (lead actor) is just superb in this.

She said that India/Pakistan romances are a real issue for them.  Her mother-in-law is Indian and her father-in-law is Pakistani.  There was a period of 20 years where her mother-in-law was unable to see family in India.  Yet, the two cultures are so much alike!  One can only say that if cross cultural films like this promote dialogue more power to them!  I was particularly impressed that the concept of 'honor' was a main theme in this movie.

2219662,5,B0007LYDO6,"Veer Zaara is my FAVORITE Bollywood movie! Its a touching film about the true meaning of love, and its sacrifices -- whether one is willing to only look out for themselves & their own needs, or be willing to give up what matters most for the best interests of the one they love.

Even though my parents are from India, my brother and I didn't watch many Hindi/Bollywood movies growing up. At home, my family either spoke English or Konkani (an Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages spoken on the western coast of India as well as the official language of the state of Goa, and a minority language in the state of Karnataka and northern Kerala) so with the exception of the sporadic Hindi classes we took as children, we did not have much experience with Hindi.

Because we understand very little (just a few random words, phrases, etc.) of Hindi, and subtitles were not available on the VHS tapes, we had to rely on our mom for translation of the dialogue. Though I'm sure she tried her best, what would inevitably happen is that while she was translating one segment of conversation, she would miss the next one, so there would be huge gaps in the translation, and often essential dialogue would deliberately (if she didn't want to translate something, thinking we weren't old enough to hear it) or accidently left out. So we had to figure out the story from the pictures and inconsistent & incomplete translations.

As a result, we didn't watch many Bollywood movies growing up (the only Hindi movies I saw in childhood & adolescence were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gopal-Krishna/dp/B006UXFUME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gopal Krishna</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masoom/dp/B0016GOKD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masoom</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramayana/dp/B0002AAMVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramayana</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahabharat/dp/B00023JH72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahabharat</a>, and a couple/few others)

I can count on one hand (with a couple of extra fingers!) or maybe two hands at the most, the number of Hindi movies I saw as a child.

But since the advent of DVDs, and Youtube, and online movie streaming, I've started watching a lot more Bollywood (and other genre) movies with English subtitles and I've been REALLY enjoying it! I LOVE BOLLYWOOD movies!

Out of all the Bollywood movies that I've now seen (at least a few dozen) ""Veer Zaara"" is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE movie!

Veer-Zaara is a poignant film about the sacrifices of true love, and stars Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, with supporting roles by Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Kirron Kher, Manoj Bajpai, and Boman Irani.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) is a rescue pilot with the Indian Air Force, an orphan who was raised by his aunt & uncle (with Hema Malini, and Amitabh Bachchan in guest-starring roles) and as a child dreamed of flying, and following the legacy of his father (who died in service to the country).

Capt Veer Pratap Singh is living his dream as a rescue pilot when he is called to assist at the scene of a bus accident, and he meets Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta), a naive young Pakistani girl who is traveling alone from Lahore, Pakistan to the holy Sikh city of Kiritpur in India, to scatter the ashes of ""Bebe"", her beloved Sikh nanny, and fulfill her dying wish.

Veer saves Zaara's life, and after a whirlwind friendship & romance, neither of their lives is ever the same again.

Twenty-two years later (set in the present-day -- 2004 at the time) an idealistic young lawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukherjee) who is working for the Human Rights Commission, trying to fill the large footprints of her late father (also a defender of human rights) gets her first case, and comes face-to-face with an aging Veer Pratap Singh. He has been rotting away in a prison cell in Lahore, Pakistan for the past 22 years, labeled as an Indian spy, Rajesh Rathod. But because Veer Singh ""remained silent"" since his arrest over two decades earlier, never speaking to anyone (even during his years of incarceration) no one (like other lawyers) was able to defend him.

But now, the case of Veer Pratap Singh has been re-opened by the Pakistani Government, and as Saamiya is assigned to be his defense attorney, she needs to unearth the TRUE reason why Veer Pratap Singh is behind bars.

Though reluctant to speak, at first, eventually Veer opens up to Saamiya, and his story tumbles out (in flashback scenes) of how he met Zaara, their whirlwind friendship & romance, and their falling in love and all that happened afterward -- a story of love, duty, courage and the sacrifices of true love.

Veer Zara is not an ordinary story -- it is a LOVE LEGEND! Veer and Zaara's love legend!

This is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation & deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration.....and will remain a legend forever!

A BEAUTIFUL movie in every way!!!",1359504000,6,5268,5.27479091995221

The plot, however unrealistic, allows movie producers to reflect on the differences and similarities between the two countries, their main religions, and their citizens' sense of belonging to the national community. The contrast between the lavish interiors and extravagant outfits of Zaara's unwanted wedding and Veer's minimalist prison surroundings is as noteworthy as that between the young and the old Veer-Zaara personae. This Bollywood movie of substance is worth watching and intelligible for a Western audience. Look for the Pataudi Palace shots!",1347148800,,787,5.735042735042735
2219667,5,B0007LYDO6,"This is the most wonderful movie I have ever seen. It has so much deep true love in it that you wonder where did all that love go for us in real life. It used to be there, but this world, society pushing the envelope into ungodly, indecent areas of life, has just removed or made it even impossible for such a love like this to exist.

If you have a love like this...somebody would surely work hard to destroy it in this world today. It's too bad, but you dream of having a love like this in your life.

Two lovers, separated by hate for being in love, gave their life to honor that love, never knowing if they would ever see or have it again. On the strength of its pure love from the very beginning, the lived on that love for 22 yrs. knowing that they wojulod never see each other again. She thinking he was dead, and he, thinking that the her life was heavenly with the man she was to marry, who put him in prison, because of their love.

I can't get this movie out of my mind. I have even dreamed of it when I was sleep. I saw it a week ago, and it is still with me. I am now looking at Devdas, but I still reflect back to this one.

What true love.  YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.  Took me 3 sittings; 1.5 hr/1.0, then the finish, but that is what I like about these Bollywood movies. They are so long, that you can get continued enjoyment out of them.

I have it when a movie is good and just when you really get into it, it's over. did not know I would fall in love with Bollywood movies, but I have.  I just ordered 2 more, just got 2 in.

I also love Black (African American movies), and when I can't find or waiting for price to drop, I can entertain myself with these Bolly movies.

It's great.  You must see this movie. You won't go wrong...and will see just what I was talking about.

It has love, happiness, joy, frockling, somber, intrigue, evil plots, holding your breath scenes, celebration and joy. You would not believe it,

And I never knew the number 786 was God's number, designating God's man; must be in Hindu.

Beautiful scenery, beautiful actors, and I will grant you I have never seen a Bollywood movie in my life which, unfortunately, made the sudden and seemingly never ending breaks into song and dance somewhat jarring to say the least.  If that is the way it is, then that is the way it is - am just not familiar with it and don't much care for it.

The way that the movie began with a cheerful happy Sharukh and then plunged to the jail cell where he was unjustly held, was awesome. The age difference was wonderful,how it kept going back and forth. Rani,so touching, was an angel in her pursuit and Preity was perfect with Sharukh.

Not a single kiss, and baskets of heart!  Ahhh, if love could only be so rich, so pure, so simple, so driven.  Only until recently, when I discovered Bollywood movies, I had no idea such emotion and romanticism could exist -- and in India, of all places!  Though sometimes overly long, and oft laden with the silly/extraneous, Bollywood films have been a great adjunct to my collections; and indeed, as with Hollywood, one has to chose carefully.  Not all are prized apples.  Yet it's amazing how so many of these films have passed us by in the West... with some of the most popular movie stars in the world, and America says ""who?"".  Once in awhile there's a ""Monsoon Wedding"" that really grabs us; and of top quality, at that.  But there are far too many others that have just faded off into the realm of a foreign mist, and disappeared.  Too bad.

2219677,5,B0007LYDO6,"Veer Zaara is a grand O'Henry-esk love story that is presented on a scale that even O'Henry could not have fathomed. The unrequited lovers willingly give their lives to each other with out knowing what the other has done. The completely unpredictable resolution of the story is sudden and astounding.

Production quality is high with a more real feel than, say Fanaa, as the village dances were less polished with a spontaneous feel even though they were not.  Rani is her usual perfect self but the director may have set the threshold of tears a little too low.  Sharukh Khan is his usual self, ranging from unusually brilliant to just standard Khan - which is pretty good. Priety Zinta is really fun to watch in every scene. The performance of her sweet and very beautiful servant Shabbo played by Divya Dutta really adds a demension to the film.  We loved the village scenes, especially the interactions between Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and others.

2219682,3,B0007LYDO6,"The film was billed as a ""love legend"" and it certainly does have grand, epic sweep. But the story moves at a snail's pace, and the very long, dull musical numbers weigh it down even more. However, the premise alone is compelling enough--a forbidden, cross-border affair between an Indian boy and a Pakistani girl. Actress Rani Mukerji plays Saamiya, a human-rights lawyer in Pakistan who's working to free an Indian who's been wrongfully imprisoned there for 22 years. The story of this brave military pilot, whose spirit has been shattered behind bars, is told in flashback. Zaara (played by Preity Zinta) travels from her home in Lahore to India to scatter the ashes of her beloved nanny, who came to Pakistan during Partition. Veer (Shahrukh Khan) rescues Zaara from a bus accident and invites her to his family home in a Punjabi village. She promptly falls in love with his warm family, their quaint community--and Veer. But she's engaged, so she returns home, and Veer follows her there for a showdown over her hand, which leads to his imprisonment. The way it all shakes out is wonderfully ironic, but it doesn't entirely make up for the overwrought climax. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1256256000,4,1399,5.542056074766355

2219686,5,B0007LYDO6,"I loved the opening sequence to this one, which is a twist on the typical Bollywood musical number. Somewhere, on a field of flowers, a young Hindustani sings a romantic song which climaxes with him and a girl running towards each other's arms. But then a gunshot rings out, and the girl quietly crumbles to the ground. And the young Hindustani, now much older, wakes up from his dream, wakes up to find himself still imprisoned. Nice twist.

The incarcerated man is Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan), who used to be a squadron leader and rescue pilot for the Indian Air Force. For reasons yet unknown to the audience, he has languished in a Pakistani prison cell for 22 years, designated numerally as Prisoner #786. For 22 years, he has served out his sentence in utter silence. But, now, into his life enters Saamiya Siddiqui, a young Pakistani lawyer (Rani Mukerji) on her first case. The odds are stacked against Saamiya as absolutely no one wants her to succeed in her profession. She takes on Veer Pratap Singh's case, anyway. And she does what no one else has been able to do, which is coax Veer into a conversation. Slowly, torturously, he begins to tell her of his life and of his one great love, Zaara. And, so, the flashbacks roll.

""Just for two moments, the caravans of our dreams made a stop. And then you went your way and I went mine."" Lyrics, beautiful and poetic, from one of the many fabulous songs in this film (""Do Pal""), and the vivid imagery evoked thru the same. Would you care for an epic love story? Maybe take a break from the grind and for a bit of time wallow with your head in the clouds? Yash Chopra's VEER-ZAARA is an opus of a thing, coming out in 2004 and featuring dazzling performances by an all-star cast and a delirious, sweeping romance.

Set in the backdrop of the always contentious Indian-Pakistani conflict, VEER-ZAARA, predominantly in flashbacks, tells the star-crossed story of Veer Pratap Singh and his Pakistani love Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta). Differing nationalities aside, Zaara also happens to be the daughter of an eminent politician. And Zaara is very much engaged, this arranged marriage intended to unite two influential political families. It just was never meant to be for Veer and Zaara, no matter how much they love each other. And, then, to save the honor of the girl he loves, Veer Pratap Singh willingly goes to prison, unjustly accused as a spy. Until, 22 years later, his lawyer Saamiya appears out of the blue to fight tooth and nail for his freedom.

While it's undeniable that his films with Kajol put Shahrukh Khan on the map, his works with Rani Mukerji and Preity Zinta have kept him on top. Both Rani and Preity are here, and they are both terrific (in fact, the whole cast is terrific). Shahrukh Khan, as usual, towers above everyone, compelling as ever, the embodiment of a movie star. While very good in the flashback sequences, Shahrukh really shines as the 22-years-older Veer Pratap Singh, with trembling hands and a weary demeanor, forlornly fingering a cherished anklet. Shahrukh, when not being the over-the-top Shahrukh, can be amazingly effective when he chooses to be more restrained in his acting (check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swades/dp/B000P25X14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swades</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chak-De-India-DVD/dp/B000XXBYTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chak De India DVD</a>). Here, he is simply marvelous, and don't be at all surprised if the emotional speech he delivers in the courtroom near the end puts a lump in the throat.

VEER-ZAARA is a loooong movie, running a smidgen over three hours. But it's very much worth watching and experiencing. The film makes you buy into the mushy stuff, things like the haunting poetry caught in a song, the sheer courage of a sacrifice made unbeknownst, the weight of shattered hopes and dreams channeled on a bauble, as well as treasured clung-to memories lavished on the same. VEER-ZAARA, to spoiler things a bit, tells not of a love spurned or denied, but of a love simply put on hold. This is a very lyrical film, with magnificent cinematography showing off the beauty of India's landscape. There are many fabulous songs here, with seriously extravagant production values on the musical numbers (my favorite is the celebratory ""Lodi""). And I haven't even mentioned that the great Amitabh Bachchan has a wonderful supporting role. And, lastly, if you enjoy courtroom dramas, the last 45 minutes or so of this film centers on the unproven Saamiya attempting to exonerate Veer in court, as she goes up against the powerhouse law firm which used to employ her. So, yes, it's also very much an underdog story.

A beautiful film.",1239148800,3,4791,5.081321473951715

I wasn't sure whether this could be depressing or violent given the context of the ex-Indian army guy detained for many years in Pakistan. It wasn't. They kept to the story about relationships, honour, cultural similarities and the romance.
This is one of SRKs best movies. He is restrained yet portrays great depth of emotion and integrity. Another exceptional performance.
It isn't light and frothy nor a typical song and dance number Bollywood. But it stayed with me well after the credits faded. Recommended.",1229990400,2,571,5.085106382978723
2219688,4,B0007LYDO6,"After first seeing the last half this on SBS (Australian Govt. Funded TV) late one evening I was amazed at how fun  The Bollywood Genre was.

Looked the film up on the Web and found out that it was one of the most successful Bollywood films ever.

The story in itself lends itself to fall into the ""Chick Flick"" category. A story of forbidden love, and the sacrifices people are willing to make...

Brilliantly put together film, by far my favorite scene is the Festival of Lodi, brilliant dance, costumes and song... you just can't help but smile and enjoy it!",1220400000,3,561,4.524752475247524

The subtitles were so far behind the movie that you found yourself frantically wanting to know what was being said or what what going on in the movie since you saw it long before the words showed up.

I don't know if it was specifically the copy I purchased.  My recommendation for any foreign film is to purchase a ""new"" copy.",1217808000,5,432,4.417721518987341

2219691,5,B0007LYDO6,"I agree with some of the negatives -- ending drawn out, Shah Rukh's aging makeup wasn't effective -- and the idea that there is only one love in a lifetime is depressing, yet, I believed this story; it's that way for some people.  The development of their love was so believable, that when it couldn't fullfill itself due to external reasons I was as crushed as Shah Rukh. Overlaid on the story is a plea for peace between Pakistan and India. I am not an expert on the politics of that region but I think the separation had something to do with the time that the British were in control.  See it, lose yourself, fall in love (if just for the running time).",1202947200,,656,4.32520325203252
2219692,5,B0007LYDO6,"This is one of my favorite Bollywood films. It is a take on the classic Romeo and Juliet love story, but with an Indian man and a Pakistani woman. Veer is a former pilot who meets Zaara, a girl from privileged Pakistani society who has traveled to India to bury her nanny's ashes. The two fall in love and the rest...well, you have to see for yourself.

Shahrukh Khan is great as he always in, incredibly invested in his character--it's hard not to love Veer. Zaara is played by Preity Zinta who is very good as well, and the two look very good together and have a lot of chemistry.

As I've said, this is CLASSIC Bollywood (in my opinion). Great songs (such as ""Tere Liye"") and a really moving story. It contains all the drama and sappiness that Bollywood movies tend to have, but this one has a lot of heart. I highly recommend it.",1199404800,5,833,4.333333333333333
2219693,5,B0007LYDO6,"Once upon a time Gone With The Wind was my favorite epic romance.  Veer-Zaara ended that forever!  New to Indian film, at first we giggled over the exageratedly dramatic opening scenes, but before long we were entranced with the beauty of it all - the scenes, the music, the characters, and the story.  V-Z is a heartbreaking and heartwarming love story, but far beyond that, it's a moral tale and a reminder of how we should determine our values and live our lives.",1195603200,5,466,4.590361445783133
2219694,5,B0007LYDO6,"""When the right woman comes into a man's life, that's when he becomes complete.""

Unfolding slowly with the bright and vibrant colors of an Indian quilt, this rich and moving romantic epic is the more hopeful side of ""The English Patient."" Whereas that film was haunted by love, Veer Zaara revels in and embraces it. The notion that destiny can sometimes overcome circumstance because, in the end, love really is all, has rarely been so wonderfully presented.

It begins in shadow, however, as a young beautiful Pakistani named Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherji) comes to aid a man known only as 786 who has been imprisoned for the past 22 years. Saamiya knows his name was once Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan) and when she uses it, the floodgates of memory open and ever so slowly the story of love which brought him there is revealed. It is her belief that once she hears it she can prove his innocence and free him, despite the handicap of gender presented in her country.

Veer is an Indian rescue pilot and Zaara (Preity Zinta) is a young Pakistani girl trying to bring her Bebe's ashes back home to India before she must return and marry Raza. It is an arranged marriage benefitting both their powerful and respected families but one that is draining Zaara's sprit. There is both humor and romance against the colorful backdrop of the two countries, which despite religious differences, director Chopra shows are closely tied together.

His Indian Uncle and Aunt, who have raised him, embrace Zaara as their own, and only when she must return does Veer learn she is bethrothed to another. He only knows he loves her and wants to be the one to marry her, but nothing of her feelings. It is a story of two hearts crossing borders, their love a river deep and flowing. When her sister Shabbo comes to Veer and lets him know how much Zaara loves him, he comes to the shrine to see her and sets in motion the tragic events which will lead the viewer back to the beginning of the film.

Khan and Zinta are terrific here but it is Rani's marvelous turn as a Pakistani girl going against tradition, very much like the love story of Veer and Zaara, which is the glue holding the film together. Like most Indian films, it is interspersed with the occasional song which propel the story forward. Some are quite beautiful and once used to their interjection as part of the narrative, are very enjoyable. For 22 years Veer has protected his love from dishonor but, once in court, Saamiya discovers something which will change all their lives forever.

Magnificently romantic and hopeful, the viewer is rewarded with an old-fashioned love story both visually and internally beautiful. Rare and rewarding, its brilliance tied to its simplicity, this is a masterpiece of the old variety. Its story of love tied to modern Pakistan and India is somehow timeless and not soon forgotten. Those wanting romance in their films will want to come to the valley filled with the season of love.",1193616000,13,2974,4.709615384615384

2219696,2,B0007LYDO6,"I think it has become a tradition of Shahrukh Khan to over act and made movies extremely cheesy. It's almost like you're watching a bad soap opera sometimes. He's a funny guy, but he's terrible at drama. And 90% of this movie is just plain drama. The whole India-Pakistan theme is good since it fosters some kind of understanding between the two groups, but otherwise the movie was not very good.

I loved the Loddi song in which you see an older couple in love.  I also loved when Zaar can't get Veer out of her mind and she's crying because she's engaged to marry another man.

Preity Zinta, in my opinion, did not act well enough for the part and certainly there was no chemistry between her Shah Rukh Khan.  NONE. That doesn't make it convincing for an epic love story. Rani Mukerji, a great nuanced actress, would have been an excellent Zaara. As for SRK, why did they make him so old and decrepit? It makes no sense if he was 22 years in prison and the love story began when he was young. Of course, SRK was amazing, a natural in his leading role as hero. Kiron Kher, Divya Dutta, were excellent. Amitabh Bachchan in his special appearance brought his formidable talent and eclipsed SRK. What a feat. What a man...NO WONDER he is a megastar.",1515283200,,823,4.591836734693878
