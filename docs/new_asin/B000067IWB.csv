NEW CHARACTERS

Nakki Guys: An American Brain Powered pilot who brings his four anti-bodies to Novis Noah to fight Orphan.
Nelly: A new friend Yuu makes in a winter landscape.
Baron: Johnathan Glenn's new mentor in the winter landscape.
The episodes in this volume speed by quicker and go at a much faster pace than the last volume. However, it sometimes gets confusing, but I guess thats what makes it so more interesting.

The packaging on this collection actually contains some terms key to understanding Brain Powered. Those were very helpful. The extras on this disc include Karaoke, production designs of the characters and, the best extra, a text interview with Yoshiyuki Tomino (director and writer) and Yoko Kanno (Composer). Both of them give deep insight to why the show was made the way it is and I strongly recommend that everybody who didn't like Brain Powered to please read it.
Overall, I was impressed with these batch of episodes and they left me drooling for more. Im really becoming attached to this show.",1035331200,,2294,4.824873096446701
