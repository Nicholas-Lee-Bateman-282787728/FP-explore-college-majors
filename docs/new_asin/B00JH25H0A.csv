8650790,5,B00JH25H0A,"Ive watched this video twice now; a testament to itscompelling approach and content. On the surface, it is a character study of Ray Bandar, a quirky, fascinating man obsessed with bones. But keep watching and youll see there are many more themes. It is about the importance ofspecimen collection in helping us understand our world and its evolution. It is about curiosity and the role thatinstitutions like museums play in fostering inquisitiveness. Its even a love story about Ray and his wife of 50 years, Alkmene, who not only puts up with road kill in her freezer, but finds Ray both lovable and inspirational. Each time I watch this video, I discover yet another storyline; perhaps because, like Ray and the animals he collects, I am also evolving in how I see the world (I hope so!). I look forward to watching it yet again for some new discoveries.",1403395200,,855,4.74496644295302
