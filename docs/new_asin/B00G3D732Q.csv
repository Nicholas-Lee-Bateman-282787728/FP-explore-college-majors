6051111,4,B00G3D732Q,"This grueling R-rated thriller is based on a failed 2005 mission when four SEAL team members were sent to kill or capture a Taliban leader. Director Peter Berg (""Battleship"") takes us into the heart of a pretend Afghanistan (actually a stunningly rugged New Mexico) for a white-knuckle experience with all the adrenalin and gunfire that you could possibly expect in a situation like this. We were physically and mentally exhausted before the final credits began to scroll.

If I were to look for a villain, I would point to the communications failures that leaves our quartet stranded in harm's way with no hope of rescue. This movie makes sure we understand what skilled and determined fighters the Taliban has become with their ever more sophisticated weaponry. Our team is painfully aware of the Rules of Engagement, even to their own detriment. This film does NOT trash our military; on the contrary, it shows the superb dedication of our warriors.

We see:
  * Mark Wahlberg (""2 Guns"") is our lone survivor; brace yourself for some bloody self-surgery before any medic is on the scene. (And remember, this is based on a true story!)
  * Taylor Kitsch (""Friday Night Lights"") makes the tough call that colors the rest of their raid.
  * Emile Hirsch (""Prince Avalanche"") has a girlfriend who wants an ""Arabic"" horse. He is told the breed is ""Arabian,"" but he's not sure.
  * Ben Foster (""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"") votes to ""eliminate"" those accidental hostages because the team's goal is to prevent more US fatalities.
  * Eric Bana (""Closed Circuit"") is the capable and dedicated officer in charge of the attempt. It's clear how wisely he plans the strike and how loyal he is to his troops.
  * Yousuf Azami (""The Unit"") is Ahmad Shahd, the notorious Taliban leader: Brace yourself for at least one beheading.
  *  I wish I had the name of that big-eyed little boy in the village: He brings the whole sortie down to a personal level.

Expect a lot of profanity (this is a military assault with young men fighting for their lives), confusing action (just like it would be in real life), more blood than I care for (remember the real fellows actually bled real blood!), and the shock when our hero sees Afghani villagers in the fight.

Mark Wahlberg went up a couple of notches in my estimation when he did a well-publicized rant about actors who complain of the hardships they suffer when filming a movie like this. He said (and I'm paraphrasing), ""They should try it in REAL life with REAL bullets and NO catered lunch!""

Stay through those final credits as they pay homage to the actual members of SEAL Team 10, complete with names, ranks, family photos, etc. By then, we know which ones are dead. Our pumped screening audience could NOT stop applauding!",1387411200,101,2761,4.760504201680672
6051112,5,B00G3D732Q,"Brutal and intense, writer-director Peter Berg's superb combat film, based on the vivid New York Times bestselling tale of heroism, takes a look at the 19 American deaths - and lone survivor - of an ill-fated incident in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.

Bloody and poetic, the incredible true story follows four Navy SEALS on a secret mission to kill a Taliban leader when they stumble across a trio of goat herders.  The SEALS choose the difficult decision to release and not kill them.  That act of mercy is rewarded by a relentless firestorm from at least forty Taliban fighters who quickly surround the four.

Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch) are the brave SEALS.  Ben Foster and Eric Bana also star.  And they do justice to the real men they play - and honor.  Berg's smooth direction captures every horrific moment whether it's a bullet's impact or a treacherous fall.  We always have a sense of where we are and the camera movement is not frantic but wide-eyed - it's shot in the same way we remember frightening real-life moments.  The editing is tight and the performances never seem anything but real.  But in the end, it's the big questions that linger.  This ambiguity gives heft to this fine film and raises it to a level of meaningful contemporary art, especially with the ironic and satisfying ending that bookends the act of mercy the men showed to the goat herders.

LONE SURVIVOR ranks with and is, in my opinion, superior to ""Platoon,"" ""Battle of Algiers,"" ""Paths of Glory"" and the sentimental, boring ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its visceral and moral intensity.  But finally, this brilliant film is about our common humanity and not the the hell of war.  Over the end credits, there are photos of the real soldiers who sacrificed their lives for what they believed to be a worthy cause.  I wept.",1387324800,517,1881,4.780185758513932

6051114,5,B00G3D732Q,"This type of movie is never my first choice to watch however, I am glad I watched it. Not that the individuals who were involved during this time spend their free time trolling amazon reviews, just in case, THANK YOU, today and everyday for your service!!! You are appreciated beyond words.... Back to the movie review. I found this movie to be moving, entertaining, and thought provoking. Certainly enabled me to pause and reflect on the acts which brought us to times portrayed in this film. Myself and family often take for granted what is faced and sacrificed for us to live in a world we generally feel safe in. It is scary to watch while the enemy closes in and the conscious choice is made to keep the unit safe while sacrificing oneself. To know there are men and women out there that choose this life to protect what is ours is beyond commendable. This movie is awesome and so are the people portrayed in it!",1530489600,,917,4.497005988023952

6051117,5,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor, the story of a four-man SEAL patrol during Operation Red Wings, is a true story of sacrifice and heroism that is mostly faithful to the source material, Marcus Luttrells written account. The film itself is a small-scale war movie, not one that has a cast of thousands, but the intimate nature of its focus in no way detracts from its great emotional impact. It is a cold-hearted person indeed who will not be deeply moved by the time the credits roll.

There are a handful of special features on the disc, and coverage is justly given to the real men who gave their lives during the intense engagement. The film looks great in the 4K format, which really shows off the you are there handheld photography style. I would like to have seen some more extra features looking at the historical context of the action depicted in the movie, but thats a minor quibble. This is an excellent film presented in an excellent format and I have no hesitation in recommending it.",1530403200,,978,4.620689655172414

At least they could have moved closer to the team for better radio contact  to see if there was an emergency,and been in a position for an extraction. Also ,when the team grabbed the shepherds,why did they not take them to the peak where they hoped for better radio reception,and hold them there until the extraction helicopter was close by and then release them.",1525305600,,671,4.591666666666667

6051157,3,B00G3D732Q,"Don't want to give any spoilers. Although the movie is based on a true story, the movies depicts many scenes n guesses as to what actually happened. For example, many scenes are based on guesses as to what happened to the three Seals that were killed but because they are dead, no one actually knows how each was killed nor exactly what they did. And the ending is not the way the actual story ended. In fact, it is ridiculous. Too much of the movie is contrived to achieve dramatic effects.  I did recon missions behind enemy lines but I never knew any recon man on a mission that did not wear camouflage paint but these guys went in with their shining faces and they talk too much for men in enemy territory. The one thing this movie does point out is that the when the officer failed to order the killing of the herdsmen that discovered them (and when released sicked the Taliban onto the patrol), he failed as an officer. When I went through officer candidate screening, each candidate was asked the question ""If a mother and her children discover your patrol, what would you do"" If you did not answer that you would have them killed, you were out of the program. Your mission always comes firest and you cannot take any chances that your mission will be compromised by showing mercy. As a result of the officers failure, 20 men died.",1522972800,,1338,4.461224489795918

6051222,4,B00G3D732Q,"Up until the release of this film, movies depicting the post-9/11 on ground battles of the U.S. in the Middle East had been fictional stories (The Kingdom; Green Zone) or fictional character studies (Redacted; The Hut Locker; Brothers). Even Zero Dark Thirty is an abridged 10 year character study of a real, yet unnamed CIA agents conversion and one single military operation after the intense storm of war had passed. Lone Survivor is of another breed  its the U.S. invasion recreated in the matter of an actual battle. It allows for audiences to have a more tangible reference to what fighting in Afghanistan was actually like, with the author of the book Marcus Luttrell in camouflage cameo (giving it his seal of approval). Documentaries have really only shown the stage of the battle field (Taxi to the Dark Side; The Tillman Story; Restrepo), yet none of them could deliver the undesired, yet curious interest in the direct horror of war,which is the grisliness that Lone Survivor strives on. The brotherhood and the determination of the life is what casts Mark Walhberg towards another laudable performance. Despite souring patriotism and a humbling memorial to the U.S. soldiers, director Peter Bergs latest reminds us of the complicated grey lines between right and wrong that prove prominently more acute in the Middle East than World War II or Vietnam.",1514419200,,1364,5.035398230088496

I'm sorry, but this was a bunch of peasants with AK47s and RPGs taking on the mightiest military the world has ever seen, and while in the end they were running back into the woods, they were not defeated.

Unfortunately, it seems that all this effort that the US is putting into that country will end as it did for the Soviets.

I feel bad for the US or any other foreign soldier on the ground. I do not see how they will ever have the feeling that they won. It seems to me you can only suppress the Taliban at tremendous cost, but you cannot get rid of them.",1502409600,,649,4.0546875

Yes, the accuracy to so much of the teams is spot on, even if the movie is condensed to one day out of several. This will be the great movie of this period in twenty years. But it will not be because it is fantastically accurate to finite detail. For all the things this movie is, what this movie is /not/ is what makes it great.

This movie is everything that needs to be said about those who have been down range. This movie is not about glory. This movie is about an idea. For those that have been there, it need not be explained. For those that have not, then this is a good peek.

This movie is not about the flag-waving American. There are no Jerry Bruckheimer moments with flags falling across backlit battlefields. It is not about whooping tail and killing all the badguys in waves of endless, faceless tides. It is not about the big victory or the decisive moment when everything makes sense. It is not about the Navy. It isn't even about the SEALs. It is not about the guns or the artillery brought to bear or the huge firepower or awesome power the US can bring. It is not about some existential crisis of war.

Chopping off heads is wrong.  Enslaving women and children is wrong.  Weaponizing women, children, and the mentally infirm against your enemies is wrong.

Watching the bonus features afterwards was a highlight for me. To understand what depth Peter Berg & all the actors & crew went to in making this film as authentic as possible is amazing. To hear the parents of the 3 Navy Seals who lost their lives say how impressed they were with the portrayal of their sons is moving. The sheer bravery of Marcus Luttrell in making it out as the lone survivor and telling  what he & his team went through is the highlight for me. The loss of 19 brave men in total should not be forgotten.
I live in Australia and have a close connection with the Defence Force here, I am in awe of the bravery of men & women worldwide who serve their countries.",1495065600,,935,4.194444444444445

True heroism on display by Navy SEALS fighting to survive to fight another day. This film is a bit of an emotional experience. I'm a former Marine. I'm thankful we have men like this willing to serve even if we ultimately question the mission. This true story needed to be told.

One thing I always thought was that all teenagers in their senor year must watch Band of Brothers and write a report on each episode. I would include this movie in with Band of Brothers.  These young people need to understand what the price of their freedoms was. They need to understand what the flag means to us Vets and what price was paid. What the price was for them to have the freedom to protest as they please.

There is no respect anymore from the younger generations for anything. It is sad to see.

The rest of the film is great, won't lie I was a little Moist in the ocular region at the end.  It was a heavy film.",1484611200,,451,4.1022727272727275

I appreciated the insight I gained on the life of Afghanis in the hills of their country and the codes of conduct some of them live by that can seem inexplicable to Westerners. I would issue a caveat, however. This book is attempting to validate the ultimate warrior-patriot ethic and way of life.

I found a couple of parts to be kind of cornball but that's me. I thought the SEALS portrayed in the film made one gigantic mistake in the fulfilment of their task which real SEALS would not have made. But that would have spoiled the story. But then again, what do I know? I think this film will grow in popularity as knowledge of the jihad against civilization gets reported in honest news and governments.

6051517,5,B00G3D732Q,"As far as being an entertaining film, Lone Survivor delivers. I thoroughly enjoyed it. As a veteran, I have to struggle with disassembling the various aspects of the production that are utter fantasy and blatantly inaccurate. As with almost all military productions from Hollywood, staying with the facts of the actual events are too difficult and padding/inflating/avoiding them is easier than to just present what actually happened. The pre-preemptive ""BASED upon actual events"" is what producers use to fall back on when people who know the truth call BS on them.

If you enjoy a well-produced story with decent cinematography and excellent action sequences, you will enjoy Lone Survivor. If you want to learn the facts regarding Operation Red Wings, read Luttrell's book. The controversy surrounding the alleged ""vote"" is described by the author and presented in the film and is oft challenged by many. Only one living person knows the truth but don't let that detract from the overarching facts.",1479254400,3,1000,5.211180124223603

How these brave men put their life's on the line for all of us. Also again from a military perspective it will  make military members mad that pencil pushers up the chain of command who have never been in combat tie the guys hands with crazy rules of engagement and to many changes  that hurt our guys.

6051570,5,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor

 Peter Bergs Lone Survivor brings an action packed, thriller that truly captures the horrors of war. Based on a true story of Marcus Luttrells failed special ops mission, Operation Red Wings, Berg focuses not on the politics of war but gives a first hand account of survival and military operations. A gut wrenching, exhausting film that for most people, is difficult to watch.
 The film begins with real footage of Navy SEAL training and what kind of sacrifice it takes to become one of these brave soldiers. While these scenes are unnecessary and heavy-handed, it does a good job of setting the tone and serious nature of the film. The movies setting takes place at a military base in Afghanistan where Axe (Foster), Danny Dietz (Hirsch), Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), and leader Micheal Murphy (Kitsch) await for their details of Operation Red Wings. The men are assigned to be dropped off in the mountains near a village suspected of hiding a high ranking Taliban leader. They are to find and capture or kill the man without putting innocent lives at risk. The men are flown in and the violent, fierce plot is quickly underway as they are discovered by sheep herders up in the mountains. They cannot kill the herders because of their rules of engagement so they are released, which turns out to be a devastating mistake. The Taliban are quickly notified that men are coming to the village and thats when the action picks up. After all the bullets, grenades, and blood are displayed only Luttrell remained after he was rescued by a villager. The forty or so minutes of pure action are displayed perfectly by Berg and the pure agony those men went through fighting for our country is shown through the work of the four actors that played the parts so well.
 The production and acting are not the only aspects that made this film so successful. Another part of that was the films make-up and costume designers. A large amount of detail went into the uniforms and clothing worn by all actors to really give a realistic feel to the film. Also, this is a war movie so wounds and gore must be present in my opinion. But thankfully, the make-up team did a fantastic job doing this, which really helped show the realities of war and make the film more realistic.
 While the movie was mainly shot in Arizona, I don't think anyone could say that affected the setting and feel of the movie. While watching the movie I just automatically assumed that it was shot in the Middle East where the actual mission took place. The sandy, tree-less desert and run down village are perfect spots for the movie trying capture its perfect setting. Another aspect of the movie that is worth mentioning is the cinematography work that made the action packed scenes so real and vivid. With quick camera movements and sharp angles used to capture the intensity of the situation made for a sitting on the edge of your seat movie.
 The entire movie was done very well from top to bottom and tells a great story of an American hero, but if i had one aspect of the movie that seemed slightly off it was during the action scenes. Those men took bullet after bullet and falling down cliffs while grenades went off next to them. Just when you think there is no way possible they could get back up, they do. The amount of damage each man took seemed humanly impossible to take, almost like they had super human strength.
 Overall, the movie captured what its intentions were. To simply show what happened to these men and tell their story. A courageous, intense film that attracts war movie buffs and adrenaline junkies. While all movies have their flaws and their well this could be done better this movie accomplished what it was meant to accomplish and Berg did an amazing job doing this. This was a truly moving movie to watch as it shows what harsh realities this world has.",1475539200,,3859,4.649560117302053

This movie had me on the edge of my seat, though I knew what the turn out would be because of the title of the movie. But that didn't keep me from enjoying this movie and wondering, ""Who's going to be the survivor?"" Mark Wahlburg does a great job portraying Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell. Everyone else did great as well and really made the movie what it is. The ending almost brought me to tears as they showed pictures and videos of the ones who lost their lives on Operation Red Wings, and then of course, Marcus himself. I thought it was really cool that Marcus appeared in the movie himself as another Navy SEAL, as a small role. It does have a LOT of F-bombs in the movie, mainly in the beginning and when the movie starts getting intense, but soldiers cuss as do most people, especially when things go wrong, so don't let that take away from this amazing movie.

6051695,5,B00G3D732Q,"I am thankful for movies like this one.  We MUST have stories like this for the next generation so they know the price that MUST be paid for a free society...or else we will slowly lose the resolve.  While we cried over a few thousand deaths in Iraq/Afghanistan we have forgotten that over 6,000 Marines died taking Iwo Jima, nothing but a rock island in the Pacific.  We have forgotten because as time has passed we grew complacent about freedom, thinking it would forever be free from payment.  We grew to despise our soldiers who train and die for this freedom.
We MUST have stories like ""Lone Survivor"" so our young people get a taste of what it takes.
Plato speaks of this in Republic Book V 466e: ...they will march out together, and, what is more, will conduct their children to war when they are sturdy, in order that, like the children of other craftsmen, they may observe the processes of which they must be masters in their maturity... 467c...we are to make the boys spectators of war...

This movie, like others depicting our struggles in Iraq/Afghanistan, shows our young men and women how to stand strong for freedom.  Some young men will watch this movie and decide that they too must pay the price.

The cinematography was just excellent.  Slow motion was used with great precision.  You should watch the ""Making"" of the movie.  The falls down steep, rocky terrain was brutal.  Luttrell tells us that bone were broken in these falls.  No doubt.
The whole story of the Pashtun man protecting Luttrell was such a great ending to the heroic and tragic story.  Very moving.

All of the special effects: falls, fire fights, wounds and field surgery were realistic to the point of making me want to hide my eyes.  Gruesome.

""Thank You"" to Director Berg, ALL of the actors and crew, the vets who trained these actors, the families of our fallen warriors, the men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for this republic, and to Marcus Luttrell for his courage to stay alive and for telling this story.",1469232000,16,2004,4.650568181818182

6051743,3,B00G3D732Q,"Military survival is one of those weird subgenres that has produced some memorable (if not obscure) films--like Bat 21 and Rescue Dawn. These movies can be intense and a little unpleasant, but they explore key themes of duty, endurance and commitment that are central to the military ethos.

Lone Survivor tones down a lot of the ""nitty gritty"" genre content (like eating bugs or being held prisoner) in favor of presenting a more patriotic and popcorn-friendly ""survival flick."" Great casting, impressive acting, and a few really cool stunts & set pieces; but it never really seems like Marky Mark is struggling all that much. He gets in some gunfights, he loses some friends, but I was never all that worried for him (especially since the title tells you he's the lone survivor), so it comes off more adventure than survival. That's great news for squeamish wives or people out for less-involved fare. In fact, the whole movie is less stressful than the few torture scenes he did in ""Three Kings""  years ago.

The first half of the film is great ... the survival and pursuit of the second half was sort of same-y ... and the dedication to historical accuracy was about on par with American Sniper. Typical heavy doses of patriotism and hero worship (with a great twist at the end to humanize the Afghanis).

Not a bad movie, but not one I'm paying retail to add to my collection. Totally worth a watch for action/war movie fans. Don't worry about it being too involved.",1467072000,,1471,4.734375

6051765,5,B00G3D732Q,"I was recently inspired to watch Lone Survivor, another excellent film about the heroism and sacrifices made by Americans in defense of their country.

Directed by Peter Berg, and starring Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana, Lone Survivor tells the story of Marcus Luttrell, the lone survivor of a four-man Navy SEAL reconnaissance team that had nearly been wiped out by the Taliban. Lone Survivor is based largely upon Luttrells memoir of the same name.

In June 2005, the SEAL team to which Luttrell is attached is operating in the mountains of Afghanistan in support of Operation Red Wings. Its mission: track down and identify and observe a notorious Taliban leader responsible for killing several U.S. Marines.

The team is made up of Lieutenant Michael Murphy, and Petty Officers Matt Axelson, Danny Dietz, and Luttrell. They successfully track Taliban leader Ahmad Shah to his hideout at Sawtalo Sar in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan. While the four SEALs are conducting their surveillance on Shah, local goat-herders stumble onto them. The SEALs briefly detain these men while they debate what to do with them, but ultimately the herders are released.

One of the herders apparently alerts Ahmad Shah and his followers that the SEALs are nearby. Very soon, the area is swarming with scores of heavily armed Taliban fighters, all bent on killing the four SEALs. How the battle unfolds, and how Luttrell manages to evade the fate of his brothers-in-arms, is the central element of this violent, bloody, and action-packed military drama.

History records the outcome of the battle, so theres no real spoiler to report here. The Taliban ultimately kills three of the four Navy SEALs.  Only Marcus Luttrell survives the ambush. Murphy posthumously receives the Medal of Honor for his conspicuous gallantry, and Luttrell, Axelson, and Dietz each receive the Navy Cross.

I thoroughly enjoyed Lone Survivor. I think it does a great job of depicting the battle that took place between the SEALs and Taliban fighters. The extended action scenes are extremely violent and bloody, but not gratuitously so. Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch, Foster, and Bana all turn in excellent, surprisingly nuanced performances. I was especially impressed with how it honors the tremendous heroism and sacrifices of each SEAL team member.

I do have one issue with Lone Survivor thats more of an observation than a criticism. The film lacks the high degree of historical accuracy that I prefer. Many of the events shown simply don't match up with official reports, or with what Luttrell wrote in his memoir. Now, I understand a movie directors need to condense action for dramatic effect, and thats okay with me. But I think its important to remember that Lone Survivor is based on a true story, and is not a strict accounting of what actually happened on that fateful day. Highly recommended.",1466208000,9,2909,5.083857442348008

6051771,5,B00G3D732Q,"Watching this movie helps me with mindsets.  Students who are Veterans who come in with combat experience have a different type of sequencing of importance when taking in information.  The military environment is very cognitive.  Explanations of context need to be very cognitive & engaging  until the structure and purpose of class is made clear.  When expectations and goals are understood the Veterans anxiety starts to diminish so the  learning can occur.  It is my job as a teacher to meet the students who come into my class and ""meet them where they are"".  Watching these types of movies helps me understand how directions where given and structure was formed.  Then I can put that approach into a classroom environment and improve the students learning experience",1465948800,,771,5.055555555555555

6051801,5,B00G3D732Q,"In this house, we are big fans of war type movies.  This one didn't let us down!  We thoroughly enjoyed it!
We saw this movie advertised while on a Matt Damon-athon.  We have been watching a variety of war type movies.  This came up after we watched Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.
I have not generally been a fan of Mark Wahlberg as an actor.  He has done some good works and some not so good.  This was definitely one of the good ones.  His acting is outstanding in this movie.
Understanding that it is based on a true story, and that just adds to the excitement and tension of the story.  The acting is very realistic and very believable.  I found myself groaning and jumping and biting my nails.  The story is very tense and captivating, sad and terrifying.
I am glad that we watched this.  Not only was the story interesting but the acting in general definitely boosted my opinion of Mark Wahlberg's acting abilities.  I was impressed. Although I was too wrapped up in the movie itself, my Other was googling the real story throughout.  I love finding something that has a truth behind it.  It makes the story that much more enjoyable.",1465171200,2,1150,4.466346153846154

6051953,4,B00G3D732Q,"Great film and a tribute to the men on this mission.  No doubt many will critic the film based on the book.  Having served in SE Afghanistan (Paktia, Khost and Ghazni Provinces), a couple of issues at the command level should of been considered with much more weight.  These include:
a) SAT phone manufactured by  Iridium went bankrupt in 1999. Iridium, the global satellite phone company backed by Motorola (MOT), filed for bankruptcy in 1999, after the company had spent $5 billion to build and launch its infrastructure of satellites to provide worldwide wireless phone service. At the time, it was one of the 20 largest bankruptcies in US history.

They SAT phone reception and overall system rarely functioned correctly-a number of units used the Iridium as Mar of 2003 to March 2004.  The reviewer of this film had a Thurya SAT phone which was very dependable.
The Navy SEALS were using a commo system that had gone bust just a few years earlier.
(Link: [...]

b) Without direct support and dedicated CAS, any TIC issue would be compromised by other situations on the ground, which is what happened.

c) When they lost commo, using any device including the Iridium SAT phone should of ""demanded"" an abort to the mission.

d) Why not flex cuff two or three people together to maximize the time for the four (4) element to move from the area

e) Why did the the unit stop?  Why did they not keep going until dark; continue attempting commo

f) When it was realized there were 30-40 Taliban or AAF (Anti-Afghan Forces), it was obvious the amount of bad guys simply overrules any continuation of the mission.  Perhaps a better option would of been to call in air strikes.

But, of course, this is all in hindsight.  I believe most with field experience might of considered the various critical decision point noted previously.",1458432000,,1828,4.7405063291139244

6052122,4,B00G3D732Q,"I'm uncomfortable with American Jingoism, Militarism, and Gun Culture. I'd not feel safe holding a gun in my hand. I became aware of the Vietnam Conflict growing up in Canada. In college I met scores of draft dodgers and have since learned the folly of American interference in the lives of the Indochinese. I have come to think that George Bush sees the principal Weapon of Mass Destruction when he looks in a mirror. Having failed to learn the lessons of History America sent troops into Afghanistan and sucked Canadians and Britains into the enterprise after Russian might failed miserably to quell the situation.

The families of young men who died in this conflict and those who returned wounded in body and spirit cling to the hope that their lives mattered and that they accomplished something positive with their sacrifice.

The training Navy Seals undergo is highlighted in the opening scenes of this movie but it concentrates on the fire-fight the four-man team loses against Taliban fighters who overwhelmingly outnumber them. The conditioning these men have undergone tells as they continue fighting after sustaining wounds the shock from which would have killed most men long since. They fight on even while their bodies are dying. Marcus Luttrell survived because an Afghan Village accorded him sanctuary in a code held sacred in their Muslim heritage.

So why did I watch the movie after reading the book? Whatever my thoughts about the futility of the effort this is great film-making. The special effects and stunt teams worked overtime. The young lad who runs down a talus slope on a mountain to alert the Taliban negotiates the terrain like a mountain goat. The firefight I suppose is no more gruesome than the video games children routinely play these days. In the end I continue to attempt to understand the mythos that motivates young men to go to war and believe that killing is justified.

This movie is remarkably short on jargon but in typical military euphemism Luttrell says, Terminate the compromise rather than kill their hostages. In the end these men died because their rules of engagement didn't cover their situation and their coms didn't allow them to get authorization from a higher authority.

Nothing here should be a spoiler for anyone who already read Luttrell's book which I'd recommend. The fact that the other members of his team died is implicit in the title, Lone Survivor.",1451952000,,2418,4.975247524752476

The brotherhood of warriors, the brutality of war and the sacrifices made all make an exciting movie but it was not as compelling as the book. When read, the Pashtun village and the Pashtunwali code played a much more significant part and brought together a much more magnificent ending to an otherwise tragic story. Besides the four hero seals there was an entire village that put it's collective life in the line to return the lone survivor to his world and that's what was missing for me.

Mr Luttrell only survived because of an Afgan village's honor code; subsequently the villagers were made promises by our government that were never fulfilled, proving to the world that America can't be trusted.",1449360000,,512,5.308641975308642

It cheapens a fascinating story about the brotherhood of ALL people and turns into a macho wet dream Hollywood spectacle. Ugh. Obviously a lot of people disagree. But take off your military goggles for a second and you will see it. Just awful stereotypes. Good american super soldiers vs. bad dark guys. It just gets old and frustrating. There is a remarkable story here somewhere brimming with human pathos reduced to a series of video game head shots. I just think we can do better than this. And it scares me that the bulk of the reviews seem to not see this at all. It actually makes me fear for all humanity. Strong words but this movie and it's popularity are disturbing on so many levels. Again let me reiterate. My problem is with THE MOVIE and the cheap portrayal of the story, not the story itself. I did give an extra star though because in a ham handed way it did a good job of showing the futile awfulness and bad decisions that define modern war, battle, and combat and a terrible waste it always is.",1447113600,,1174,4.389908256880734

6052206,5,B00G3D732Q,"I rated ""Lone Survivor"" 5-stars because it was an engaging and thought-provoking film done with great attention to detail.  This is not a movie-star kind of movie, it's not a John Wayne, Leonardo DeCaprio or Bruce Willis movie, it's a movie about an actual event as portrayed by a solid group of competent actors.  The movie was less about individual valor (though there was plenty of that) than it was about the team and how they maintain their coherence under the most hellish conditions; if the bad guys didn't kill you, the terrain certainly would.  Never the less, I had trouble with a number of technical / military issues. I'm not trying to play armchair general or Monday morning quarterback here, but there were a bunch of things that just struck me as being unprofessional if not outright careless.

1)  Under-manned:  You're going after a major Taliban leader and assign just four men to do the job?  This guy is going to be protected to the max, the film led me to believe the mission was to engage the hostiles straight on and take out the leader.  At first, I thought it was going to be a sniper plus support team, but it seemed like they were planning an assault right from the start; if that were the case, there should have been another team right behind them ready to provide security and cover-fire in the event of a rapid retreat.  I thought a typical Seal Team full complement was comprised of seven men.

2)  Wrong Armament:  There was a scene early on when they were scoping out this village and spot their target; one of the guys was asked if he could ""make the shot"" and he indicated negative.  So why didn't they bring a 50-cal sniper rifle or similar weapon capable of making a long-range shot?  In Vietnam, two-man sniper teams ran missions like this all the time, often staying out in the bush for days waiting for the right moment and conditions to make that one shot then melt away undetected into the jungle.

3)  Mission Prep:  Related to #1 & #4 .  If you're sending out only four guys and it's likely they're going to encounter hostiles, provide them with extra ammo, food and water to make supply caches at one or more defensible fall-back points.  They'll have the ability to hold off a larger force long enough for a rescue.  If you can't spare the manpower for the mission, at least provide the maximum amount of material support to ensure extended survival.

4)  Communications:  There were known problems -- serious problems -- involving poor communications before the mission even started.  Why wasn't this addressed?  These missions are dangerous enough when everything is working, but no reliable communications?  An AC-130 gunship stayed on station during the first six hours of the mission, could it not have refueled and returned or been replaced by another aircraft that could loiter for a while and serve as a communications platform?  The radio equipment provided seemed to lack the necessary power to ensure the signal got through. As an amateur radio operator, I have to ask why couldn't they have set up a portable high-powered 25-watt repeater station using a high-gain directional antenna at an elevated site immediately upon landing and while they still had air cover?

5)  The Goat Herders:  They had this long existential philosophical debate over what to do with the goat herders in the middle of a now-compromised mission?  WTF!!!!!!!  I'm not a military guy, but sweet mother of Jesus, couldn't they have sorted this stuff out BEFORE the mission?  I mean, it ain't like this kind of thing hasn't happened before, set up some bloody protocols!  Once they discovered the old man carrying a two-way radio of the type known to be used by the Taliban, end of discussion -- you quietly waste them all and get out.  The commanding officer or senior NCO on the scene makes the call and does the deed; there's no discussion before, during and especially afterwards -- it never happened, it's doesn't show up anyone's after-action report.

6)  Rules Of Engagement:  This is war, there are no ""rules of engagement"".  Did the Taliban have rules of engagement?  Not much the military could have done about it, but glad the movie pointed out this absurd practice that got a lot of our people needlessly killed.  Just a sore point with me, nothing to do with the movie.",1446854400,,4315,4.72289156626506

The ending, with the pictures of the SEALs that were lost made the movie even more impressive for me.

6052258,5,B00G3D732Q,"I was very impressed by this 2013 fact-based war US film. It is a very tense, very realistic, well filmed and well-interpeted war drama. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

War in Afghanistan, 2005. A local Taliban leader named Ahmad Shah is trageted by US Army, after he carried succesful attacks against Americans as well as against villagers who were aiding US forces. A Navy SEALs unit is ordered to capture or kill Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is send forward to locate the target. These four SEALs are: team leader Michael P. ""Murph"" Murphy (Taylor Kitsch); sniper Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), sniper Matthew ""Axe"" Axelson (Ben Foster) and communications specialist Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch). The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they must make a trek through the mountains - and then the film really begins.

This is a very good war film, one of the best I saw in recent years. It is based on real events and the heroism of Navy Seals is in no way exaggerated - the real life Lt. Murphy received Medal of Honor for his actions that fateful day and a US Navy destroyer was named after him. The film follows the real story, very, very closely and we can actually feel it. This is definitely not a propaganda film or a recruitement tool, but even if the events described are tragic, the general mood of the film is uplifting - this is probably why all the ""progressive "" medias hated it so much... Characters feel real and they are quite likeable, even if their language is strong and their manners sometimes questionnable - still, in those times of great danger, I am very, very glad that West still has soldiers like that...

Action scenes are realistic, but still unbelievable, much, much better in any SF or super hero movies. Images of Afghan mountains add an majestic element to the whole drama. All actors did very well - that includes also Eric Bana, who plays Lt. Commander Kristensen, one of the Navy Seals who will join in the action only later. For my personal taste the best performance was that of Taylor Kitsch.

Even if we more or less know how it all will end, this film still keeps us very much guessing until the end as for the details. It is a very tense and powerful thing - it is almost impossible to stop watching and I advise you not to do it, in order to not lose the rhytm...

I was very impressed by this film, I am glad that I bought and watched it and I will definitely keep my DVD for another viewing in the future. ENJOY!",1444608000,,2572,4.5344827586206895

6052396,3,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor is the true story of a Navy SEAL operation in Afghanistan that goes wrong pretty much from the very beginning and leaves the SEALs in a situation that gets worse with each passing moment. The film has many good sides to it but unfortunately lacks the soul and character development that made films like Saving Private Ryan and Apocalypse Now great.

The film does a lot right. The battle sequences hit hard and are well done. With a title like Lone Survivor and the fact knowing that only Marcus Luttrell survived, the viewer obviously knows that the other SEALs are doomed but wondering who is going to die first, second and third does add suspense to the sequence. The actors playing the SEALs do a good job with what they are given and the supporting cast does a good job as well.

With Peter Berg as the director I wasn't expecting to say that the character development side was a bit lacking. His last film was Battleship, which, surprisingly, had a good bit of character development and restraint for a summer blockbuster. I was given enough to feel sorry when certain characters died and I was fully expecting more of the same from Bergs Lone Survivor. Unfortunately, the character development was limited to the required scenes letting the viewer know that some of the SEALs have a family. Oh yeah, and the out of place scene of a SEAL dancing. I didn't really find that these scenes were enough to prompt more than a passing oh he died feeling.

Despite some shortcomings, I did like the film. It does an excellent job of showing a mission going from bad to worse to even worse. Its competently made and acted but to be truly great it need more. I give it 3 stars.",1437264000,,1687,4.542763157894737

'Danny Dietz' (Emile Hirsch) 'Matt Axelson' (Ben Foster) are scheduled to front 'Operation 'Red Wings'
their task to eliminate notorious 'Taliban/ Al Qaeda leader 'Ahmad Shah'
The Commanding Officer at base - 'Erik Kristensen' (Eric Bana')
They have to make their way through dense and rugged Mountain terrain to reach and be in sight of the
Target.....by chance a small group of Goat-Herders happen across the 'Seals' position, this puts the Op'
in jeopardy, decisions have to be made, to continue they would probably have to kill the captives, a young
boy, a possible Taliban Fighter and an elderly Man.
They decide to let their prisoners go and withdraw from the operation, however the eldest of the young men
makes his way speedily to the Mountain village.
The Four are soon faced with a large 'Taliban Fighter' force, a desperate and intense fire-fight soon follows,
the four courageously fight the insurgents, killing many, but seriously outnumbered they each start picking
up injuries from the fierce flow of bullets and bazooka-fire directed at them, though they attempt to back
away the 'Fighters' just keep coming at them.
'Mike' after many attempts manages to get through to base, against standard procedure mission commander
'Erik Kristensen' leads a rescue mission using two troop filled 'Chinook Helicopters' without 'Black Hawk'
cover, the rescue mission fails, the 'Chopper' with the Commander on board is shot down, all are lost.
Only one of the four still lives, a follow up rescue mission fails to locate him, however his story is far from over.
This is an incredibly realistic account of a 'Afghan' mission that is based on a True event.............
This is a truly intense, tense and graphic account which will no doubt have you tied up in knots feeling every
impact of both jumping down a rocky slope, every bullet that connects.
Great performances from the key-artists involved.
A story of valour and battle to survive...............This a must see......

Never give up!
When things are looking there worst, and you think that there is nothing else you can do, keep fighting. I loved the strong message this movie supplied, although it his dark and gory at times, concerning duty, honor, and ethical conduct.

I was very awed when I first viewed it thinking of what these men did for us.  I have watched it several more times and it still causes me to have goosbumps thinking of how intense the gun fight was and how strong these men were to deal with the situation as they did.

You owe it to those who serve to at least vicariously understand the risks and the life and death decisions they make (that sometimes affect their own lives). See also that some Afghans are honorable people that put the ancient hospitality customs ahead of even the safety of their family to protect one of ours, and see how our State Department (under Hillary) can't rise to do the right thing any time.

The battle is not over for our vets when they get home, that's when the battle begings for what is ""Veteran's Affairs"" going to do with them? It's shameful after some gave and after some gave all that they get home to this indifference.",1431648000,,736,4.533834586466165

6052573,5,B00G3D732Q,"LONE SURVIVOR

This is an incredible story and an excellent film. For any of those who have yet to read the book I highly recommend it. It is the story of Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell and what he and his fellow seals went through one horrible day. This story is heartbreaking but inspiring at the same time. I highly recommend seeing the movie and reading the book.

The story follows Luttrell and three fellow seals as they go on a recon mission in Afghanistan. Things get bad when some citizens stumble upon them but things get worse from there. After releasing them one goes and lets the Taliban in on where these Americans are. They start up the mountain to hunt these men down. The Seals use everything they know and have to evade capture and try to survive until they can be rescued.

Of course the title gives a lot of it away but that doesnt even cross your mind when you are watching this. What these men went through, including the rescue mission is amazing and jaw dropping. I am so glad I went to see this in theaters because I would have missed out. The ending in particular was amazing and is inspiring, especially when someone can do that for someone else, I loved it.

I can never do these men justice with any kind of review but I can tell you that I loved this film. The Blu-Ray comes with all kinds of features on the real story and the people involved. The families get to speak about their relatives they lost. Also we get a feature on the honor code that played heavily into Luttrells survival. We get to see the making of the film and how details were of the upmost importance. I highly recommend this movie and the book as well as I said before.",1430265600,,1666,4.330128205128205
6052574,5,B00G3D732Q,"Superb, not as bloody as some might think, way less gore than Saving Private Ryan (way less). You owe it to those who serve to at least vicariously understand the risks and the life and death decisions they make (that sometimes affect their own lives). See also that some Afghans are honorable people that put the ancient hospitality customs ahead of even the safety of their family to protect one of ours, and see how our State Department (under Hillary) can't rise to do the right thing any time.

The battle is not over for our vets when they get home, that's when the battle begings for what is ""Veteran's Affairs"" going to do with them?  It's shameful after some gave and after some gave all that they get home to this indifference.",1430265600,,737,4.533834586466165

6052609,1,B00G3D732Q,"After reading American Sniper on my Kindle, I purchased Lone Survivor on my Kindle. The book is FANTASTIC! The movie bears almost no resemblance to the book whatsoever. The 1st half of the book was about Marcus's childhood in Texas & SEAL training. Marcus's SEAL team saw their 1st action in Iraq & were later deployed to Afghanistan. The actual mission on which the movie is based was FUBAR from the very start. It was one SNAFU after another. The part in the movie about ""rules of engagement"" and being ""criminally prosecuted"" for killing unarmed ""civilians"" is factually correct. The firefight with the Taliban went on literally for hours. The layout of the Pashtun village was not factually correct. Marcus was ""missing in action"" for over 8 days. A large portion of the book focused on the drama that unfolded at his parents' ranch in Texas. The entire community, his friends, and fellow SEALS from all over the U.S. came to the ranch to maintain a vigil until ""something"" could be confirmed. To avoid being captured by the Taliban, the villagers moved Marcus at least 3 times before he was rescued. The village children called him ""Dr. Marcus"" while he treated them, recovered himself, & waited on the anticipated rescue mission. There never was a firefight between the villagers & the Taliban as portrayed in the movie. The last part of the book covered what happened after Marcus returned to the U.S. Obviously, none of which was covered in the movie. The producers of this movie could & should have been much more faithful to the facts in the book. It would have made a much better movie. I was about to buy this movie when it recently aired on either Showtime or HBO. After watching it, I was glad I had not spent my money on it. The movie actually sickened me because it was so inaccurate and left out so much of the heart wrenching details & human interest background found in the book.",1429056000,19,1898,4.651785714285714

6052634,3,B00G3D732Q,"A lot of people really loved this movie and it is definitely a cut above the John Wayne macho man clichs of yore. But it's still just another Hollywood movie. The attempts at character development are pretty sad and the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to focus on, so there's no depth. In addition the actors portraying the SEALs really needed a lot more physical direction to be convincing. The TV series Strike Back does a great job at this, so it's not clear why the actors in Lone Survivor weren't put through an equivalent program in order to move (individually and as a group) more like real SF rather than like a bunch of actors mindful only of how the shot was blocked.

One Congressional Medal of Honor, and three Navy Crosses were awarded to the members of this 4-man SEAL Team, and the thanks of a grateful nation.

6052640,4,B00G3D732Q,"As a stand alone movie Lone Survivor gets four stars. If you compare the movie to the book then I would knock the movie down to a three. First the movie tells you the story took place over three days. That is not true. The entire story was 7 or 8 days. The movie also does a terrible job of showing the relationship Marcus Lattrell form with Muhammad Gulab who risked his family and fellow villagers to Protect Lattrell from the Taliban.
The second important aspect of the book cut out by the movie was what was happening at the Lattrell household in Texas during the time Latterll's team was missing. While this was returned to probably too many times in the book it was important to show how the Texas community and SEAL community rallied around the Lattrell's.

Bottom line is if you haven't read the book the movie is a four star. If you have read the book then the movie is three stars.",1428105600,,891,4.367469879518072

So as the book, how much the more as a movie with the lone survivor there to make sure it was faithful, in the way ""We were soldiers once, and young,"" does with Gen. Hal Moore (ret.).
Without spoiling the story snd treatment in film, it's visceral visual velocity impacts the mind and senses in a way few movies do, but not to overwhelm in classic blockbuster fashion, rather to infiotm as Act of Valor does so well, almost quietly so, speaking more by its humble seriousness thsn big explosions and special effects.

6052681,5,B00G3D732Q,One of the best films that Ive watched. Its exciting and thrilling in every arch that the story goes there is an incredible plot twist. It couldn't keep me off my seat. I was on the edge expecting the unexpected to come out next.,1426982400,,229,4.2272727272727275

6052684,5,B00G3D732Q,"I am a Marine who served during the 90's with no combat experience. I did enlist in 1992 in the infantry in order to do so but it was over before I was combat ready. Men like Marcus Luttrell are the kind of men that keeps America free, regardless of your political or personally opinionized affiliation. Men like Marcus Luttrell go into combat with a mission, but their true mission, as with any combat soldier, is to keep the man to his left and his right safe and alive. He couldn't do that. He and his men were too overwhelmed. He stayed alive by some miracle but that blessing has a curse. He stayed alive. His men didn't. This man, who gave more than his life for his country, has to live with the death of his buddies his whole life. I can barely type from weeping...This man, despite your feeling about anything, deserves your entire respect, along with those who died by his side. They did a job that the vast majority of you could not.

Now about the movie. I know that Mark Wahlberg ""leans left"" in his political views but there is not one movie he is in that shows this. He is my favorite actor and in this film he only strengthens that opinion. He has shown time and again his ability to portray a vast number of different rolls and this one reprises his roll as a Marine sniper from the movie ""Sniper"", yet he still brings a SEALs' flavor. As always with Mr. Wahlberg's acting, you can barely notice that it is him playing the role. He is that good at playing his character.

On another note, Marcus Luttrell himself is in the movie. He plays a random SEAL that you can see a few times at the start. Nice touch for that one.",1426809600,,1637,4.27741935483871
6052685,1,B00G3D732Q,"If you are going to watch this movie don't read the book first. There are so many inaccuracies in the movie from the book you will be very disappointed in the made for Hollywood crap & what was never told at all. What an unbelievable true story that should have been fully told truthfully instead of just making another war movie. No character development what-so-ever. You never really know anything about the main characters other than they are SEAL's. You don't learn about the relationship between the Pashtun & Talliban which to me was one of the most important aspects of the whole story to fully understand how Marcus survived what otherwise was unsurvivable. By the way, there never was a battle between the Pashtun & Talliban which was in the movie. Marcus was actually face to face with the Talliban leader they were trying to take out with his Talliban army right behind him & not one shot was fired. Marcus was allowed to just walk away after he & the other seals had killed countless numbers of his forces. Now how do you not include that in this movie! There were amazing human, historical & cultural stories to be told about this amazing moment in time & they totally left it out?! This had the potential to be one of the all time greatest real life war stories ever put on film & they totally missed the boat. What a shame. I do highly recommend the book.",1426809600,13,1371,4.51004016064257

6052736,4,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor delves inside the realm of covert combat missions carried out by the United States Navy SEALs in Afghanistan, and the narrative mainly focuses on a sniper operation. The section of men assigned to the task consisted of elite field veterans and the decisions they make early in the mission have profound consequences. The battle scenes are ferocious as the SEAL team engages a much larger enemy force, and support eventually comes from a most unexpected direction. Based on true events the storyline displays courageous honour among the SEALs, but also raises considerations with regards to communications failures and essential precautions in conducting a rescue mission. The casualties sustained by the SEALs and the strategic failures most likely could be used constructively to prevent similar incidences. The film certainly demonstrates how intense combat can be and how the will to survive can overcome the toughest of odds.

6052780,4,B00G3D732Q,"I personally enjoyed this movie for a couple reasons.  First I'm US Navy Retired and my Navy Job was to maintain the H-60 Helicopter Flying Missions so the Navy Seal Teams in turn could make their missions in part by being transported to key locations by our Squadron Aircraft.  I worked closely in this regard with the Navy Seals during my Navy Career.  They are selfless heros that our key players in keeping our Country's freedom alive.  In order to become a Navy Seal these recruits go through hell in their military training.  I also enjoyed this movie because it was based on a true story and in my opinion makes it more realistic to what they do on a daily basis to earn their paychek.  In the end scenes of this movie the viewer becomes aware that the Afganistan Nationals also disagree with the Al Qaeda terrorism acts that are going on in their own country.  These Nationals risked their own lives to save the ""Lone Srvivor"" of Seal Team 5 at all costs.  I was actually impressed with the brief but significant bonding and comradarie that transpired between Markus (Lone Survivor) and the small group of loyal & anti-terrorist Afganistan Nationals.",1424995200,2,1158,4.669950738916256

Kind of blew me away that Marcus was so much taller than Wahlberg. Wahlberg played big. It would be great if they had an extended version including more of the drama in the village and got more about how culture compelled the villagers to take him in and protect him. It is a positive part of the story we don't get from the pundits and 24-hour news cycle. A great point to make, regardless of where we are in the world and Marcus expressed that very well in his book. Got to read the book if you haven't yet.

The only thing missing was good old Rambo.

This movie was missing John Wayne if John Wayne was still young and alive today or even the late comedian actor John Belushi of Saturday Night Live to play the main character of Navy SEAL, Marcus Luttrell. The movie is on par with such great fictional works as Die Hard and Rambo.

When watching this don't think every scene and every word was actually how it all happened. There was quite a bit of liberties taken by the movie studios/producers/screen writers to present this film as an over the top farce version that flowed more like an action comic book.

This is an action movie that was disguised under the pretext of a personal account but was given to the audience as another Hollywood action flick to make money off you.",1424304000,5,853,4.525974025974026

A rousing action flick, wrapped up with the tale of a group of brothers being ripped away from one another and the toll this mission took on so many captured for posterity.

This movie really put me through a range of emotions and gave an entirely new perspective to what our troops must endure at the direction of policies and politics. To witness the integrity, valor, and comradery of our soldiers was a humbling experience, for me. Plus, I gained a whole new level of respect and empathy for the populations in terrorist -occupied areas for what they must face every single day from a heartless Islamic ideology. Honor and courage win, over evil brutality, even for just one day. Even for just one American soldier in enemy territory.",1422835200,2,650,4.7105263157894735

Zero Dark Thirty makes some great points as a film, but in terms of a realistic depiction of the SEALs it is just silly when compared to Lone Survivor.  Lone Survivor, like American Sniper, will stay in your head (resonate) long after you see it.  It is an amazing story that is presented here is an outstanding manner.  I really didn't think Wahlberg could pull this off, but he did a remarkable job.

6053094,2,B00G3D732Q,"Sorry about this but there are certain aspects of this that are distasteful to those of us who know Seals personally.  A great tribute and great acting and it does bring out certain aspects of war that most of us do not like but are forced to believe in.  Specifically, in war when you are dealing with an animal, treat him with the respect that adversaries may deserve in the war setting, but not with compassion.  I knew what was going to happen when they let the Talaban Rock Skipping gold medalist go and he reached his compatriots and they got on the offensive before the Seals could get one mile from the perimeter.  Secondly, and this is from intimate knowledge of what seals do and how they do it, is I have never seen or heard of Seals that rappel the way they did in this movie.

To see the physical endurance those men had to endure, their determination to complete their mission, and then their extreme struggle to survive was unbelievably - I can't think of any other word but Astounding. I'm not a soldier but I was raised in a military family and have family members on active duty. This film appeared to be realistic and depicted so many things I truly hope no member of our troops ever have to go through. As naive and unrealistic as that wish is, it's what's in my heart.

6053177,5,B00G3D732Q,this is a awesome movie. this is probably one of the best based on true events movie I have seen in years. I just want to say in this review thank you to those who serve and protect like these men did and all others. and thanks to marcus lutrell for letting Hollywood telling this amazing story. and also thanks to the film makers and actors for portraying these mena\ as well as they could. I also want to say that the action is great and the story is great and the acting is great. this story needed to be told of the courage of these men and the courage of the afganistans who helped marcus if it was not for them. he would not of made it. and it's good to know that there are those who help like they did. that proves that they are all not bad.

playing Marcus Luttrell.  The setting was gritty and realistic, and it is amazing what a person
can endure if he has to do so.  The fact that Marcus had help from some of the villagers was
surprising to me.  It was told that there is an ancient hospitality custom among the mountain

6053251,3,B00G3D732Q,What I liked about this movie is the portrayal of how mentally and physically tough the Navy Seals have to be.  What I didn't like about it was a 20 to 30 minute overkill of watching 4 Navy Seals get the living @#%! kicked out of them over and over again and again.  A little less brutal physical punishment and a little more time looking at the relationships the Seals had with each other and/or family would have put more sympathy and emotional investment into the story and the characters.,1417824000,,492,4.455555555555556

The in-depth action shots are what really separates this film from the rest. It makes you feel that you are there in the heat of battle with them, and all you want to do is survive.

Great story, cast, direction, pacing, cinematography & realism as well.  I was also surprised at how suspenseful it was even though I knew how it would all end.  But If you enjoy realistic portrayals of combat with gritty, intense combat scenes & don't mind witnessing a few scenes that will probably make you wince becuz of the graphic brutality of war, you will def like this film too.

I'd say this is director Peter Berg's finest film so far & the main cast members were all very decent as well.  Especially Mark Wahlberg & Ben Foster.

The brave young men were sent ill-equipped (and without a sufficiently trained sniper), with faulty intelligence, on a mission with no rules of engagement, no exfiltration (the senior officers who pledged to retrieve them found other things to do).  I've seen hundreds of war movies about most of our interventions since WWI.  Some were gruesome, some were sad, many were heroic, stirring in me patriotic feelings and anger toward our enemies, but this one made me FURIOUS with our own military.  And I will NEVER see another war movie after seeing this one.  Yes, it's made and acted well enough, but the waste of lives of these men was inexcusable.  Indeed, in war there are casualties, but incompetence and indifference in the chain of command is reprehensible.  I'm surprised the US government didn't try to stop the release of this film.  [On another note of sadness and anger, I remind everyone that our great hero Alvin York of WWI was left to die in pain and in poverty at home in the 1960's.

Having read many books as well as having seen lots of video material about special forces from all over the world I was familiar with the US navy SEALS and some of their operations in the different conflicts.

Hearing my mentor recommending the movie as it shows what a human body is capable of when you control the mind, I didn't want to wait any longer and decided to purchase and watch it.

I bought the blu-ray from amazon and when it arrived I took the time to watch it.

The first thing that drew my attention was the soundtrack composed by explosions in the sky.  This already set the state of never give up, keep going and one of the messages of the movie never out of the fight.

The movie tells the story about the four man SEAL team of operation Red Wings.  After their mission gets compromised and the terrain making communication for calling for exfiltration impossible they have to fight for their own lives as well as each others life.  All for one and one for all.

Its a story about brotherhood, selfless sacrifice, courage, will to live, never giving up and humanity

The film was gripping from the very beginning and evoked different strong emotions at different times in the movie.

After watching it I went through the extras which tell more about the different team members portrayed in the movie and shows interviews with their family members.  It also explains the Marcus Lutrell and the makers intent with making the movie.

The making of with how the actors were trained and how Marcus was involved was also very interesting.

Its a great movie, which helps to put things into perspective, motivational in a sense.  The selfless sacrifice and the bond between the team members

Highly recommended to anyone who needs motivation, are interested into the sense of brotherhood and the bond amongst the people serving in the SEAL teams as well as the Night stalkers, and last but not least to those who want to contribute and support the families of the fallen SEAL TEAM members and crew of the Chinook.",1416528000,9,2123,4.648793565683646

I was on the edge of my couch, transfixed, sometimes horrified, but better writing, acting and directing would be hard to find. It got me in the gut, and I expect the same reaction each time I watch. If I could give this ten stars I would.

For an up-close look at what modern war is and does, relationships among soldiers protecting the lives of their comrades at the risk of their own, this movie is important and revealing.",1416528000,,518,4.285714285714286

6053446,5,B00G3D732Q,"The Lone survivor is and American war film that is based off of a real story

about a Navy Seal and his fellow team members. Marcus Luttrell was a navy seal

team member that was famed for being the only survivor in a combat mission that

went astray Middle East. Luttrell wrote a book about his experience, which went on

to sell over 275,000 copies.

After seeing this movie I couldn't stop talking about how much it surpassed

my expectations that I had from seeing other war films in the past. The actors in this

movie portrayed the story down to the fine details of the soldiers wounds and

scenery it helped make it feel realistic to the viewer. Mark Wahlberg was the

starring actor in this movie he represented Marcus Luttrell and represented him

well and gave the impression that he was a seal team member. Luttrell was on set

the whole time making sure that the story was portrayed realistically, and he also

was featured in the movie making short appearances as another team member.

If you have seen the movie you would know that the budget was high end,

because the amount of props and explosions in this movie is off the charts. The

estimated budget of this movie was 40-50 million dollars; three different production

companies contributed to the funding. The Graphics in this movie were outstanding

from the wounds suffered to the explosions and guns being fired for half of the

movie. The storyline of this movie is fantastic due to the fact that is actually

happened, so we know that nothing was overdramatized or fake. The movie

supports all the needs of moviegoers and thrills the viewer from beginning to end.

This movie is shows the reality of war and all that comes with it and should top the

charts as one of the best war movies of all time.",1414713600,,1777,4.556962025316456

6053496,4,B00G3D732Q,"This movie struck a deep chord within me, especially knowing it was a true story.  I had not a clue as to what the entire story centered around, other than knowing it was a war movie with a self-explanatory title tied to it.  What I viewed was a story brimming with courage, survival, sacrifice, love, hope, and unfortunately the brutal reality of modern-day warfare.  If you want to get a dose of the present day rules of engagement please watch this movie.  The movie centered around a unit of Navy Seals with a mission to take-out a Taliban leader that brutally killed 20 Marines held in captivity.  The cast of characters selected by Director Peter Berg was mere perfection, each with their own unique set of characteristics that meshed together well with one another.

The ""beginning of the end"" all started within the first 30-35 minutes with the introduction of the Afghan villagers herding cattle up toward the summit unknowingly entering the small vantage point set-up by the Seals staking out the townspeople below.  Once that scene unfolded the audience was engaged in an intense, violent, and brutal fire-fight of survival.  Some scenes of the Seal team flopping and rolling down the mountainside banging into stones, tree stumps, and getting shot all over their bodies was a bit far-fetched (as if they were super-heroes), but I suspended my belief due to the adrenaline rush playing out moment by moment.  I started understanding the direction the movie was going as soon as the fire-fight started and it was ugly and realistic.  I cringed throughout many parts of the movie due to the gore, violence, and suffering endured by the soldiers.

The movie elicited some intriguing themes and debatable points of interest beyond the cold realities of the battlefield, such as the moral and collective decision-making Operation RedWing made by allowing the villagers be set free, as well as the risk or decision-making of US forces invading villages that consist of innocent lives making efforts to assist American soldiers.  In the end their are no black and white decisions when it comes to war.  If you want to view an intense and realistic view of modern day warfare I highly suggest you give this movie a view.  In conclusion I have to tip my hat off to director Peter Berg for putting together the ending credits of the movie.",1413849600,,2340,4.861460957178841

6053509,4,B00G3D732Q,"Based on a true story, a story about four Navy SEALS on a counter insurgent mission in the remote Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan that goes tragically awry, LONE SURVIVOR is a gripping, intense, and overwhelming story depicting a fierce determination to survive, no matter the costs.  The four SEALS, Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), and Matt Axelson (Ben Foster), are discovered by three goat herders wandering in the upper elevations of the mountains; thus the team has a dilemma:  kill the civilians, which violates the Rules of Engagement; tie them up and leave them to be found in the coming days; or let them go and abort their mission.  Unfortunately, the team chooses the third option, only to discover their location is too remote to communicate for a rescue chopper.  They encounter a huge force of fierce Taliban fighters, and an intense firefight ensues.  This violence is graphic and definitely not for the faint of heart.  All four of the men sustain severe injuries, and true to the film's title, only Luttrell survives the battle.  A local village comes to his aid, with one of the villagers hiding him in his house, and LONE SURVIVOR becomes a race against time to alert the military of Luttrell's location before the Taliban wipes out the entire village.

All four of the actors are superb and incredibly believable, particularly as they sustain ever more severe injuries and realize the hopelessness of their plight.  Writer and director Peter Berg deserves similar platitudes for presenting such a riveting and intense story.  One star off due to the film's slow motion start, taking much too long to set up the main story; however, once the mission goes awry, LONE SURVIVOR moves at a breathtaking pace.  This is a true tale of courage and the indomitable will of the human spirit,  a tale enthusiastically recommended.

6053522,5,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor is quite the moving and violent film.  Surprisingly the first 30 minutes is extremely boring and accomplishes nothing at all and is nothing more than typical soldiers having generic discussions that we've seen in several other films.  It's honestly really bad writing, so it's quite the extraordinary jump in quality and storytelling when the attention turns to the Navy Seals out in Afghanistan who suddenly find themselves in the tricky situation of having to react quickly to the surprise appearance of a few goat farmers heading up the hills towards their direction while the Navy Seals are scanning the scene and looking for a particular al-Qaeda member.

They discuss what to do with the Afghans once they're caught.  If they let them go they'll run back to the others and get revenge by storming the hills with weapons and looking for the Americans.  If they tied them up around the nearby trees they can at least by themselves some time to continue onward.  If they kill them, well, they'd have to live with the guilt.  So what do the Navy Seals do?

They choose the first one which turns out to be a regrettable decision.  Soon these Navy Seals gentlemen find themselves surrounded by danger.  They're outnumbered by quite a bit too.  Though the plodding nature of this particular segment builds slowly, it's only because once it begins you're going to experience basically over 1 hour and 20 minutes of gun shooting, bomb exploding chaos with bloods and bullets flying everywhere.  If you're familiar with this story you'll know what happens at the end.  It's not a pretty situation in any conceivable way.  This is just a downright grim film to watch so be prepared for the violence to be extremely high and quite possibly realistic.  The helicopter going down in one scene is just... wow.  The timing of it occurring really stunned me.

I guess if there's any positive outcome well, at least the ending is nice.  There's a moment of pleasantness despite the traumatic experience thanks to a savor I guess you could say.  A moment of hope that arrives out of nowhere.  A touching moment to be sure, but not touching enough to make the outcome any less horrific.

Compared to other war movies I'm pretty sure this one has to rank really high in terms of violence and realism.  It's entertaining to watch, but the kind of you movie you feel guilty for enjoying due to the true events that it's based on.  So with that, it's an extremely well-made film, I suppose it's mostly accurate (though someone below mentions there's no rattlesnakes in Afghanistan- not sure if that's true or not) so I guess a few things here or there have been changed.",1413590400,,2666,4.747826086956522

On the plus side, the acting is pretty good, and the story is moving ( a true story), but this could have been so much more inspiring if there was more emphasis on depth and less on showing off macho blood and guts.  i can only imagine that this has 5 stars because people are being patriotic out of respect for the people on whom this is based.",1412640000,2,606,4.336283185840708

I do wish that the movie had told of him being visited by the men who saved him after he returned home.  It kind of restored my faith that not ALL  Afghanistan's people are fanatics.

It was truly painful to watch at times, but I believe that everyone who left that theater gained a new respect and appreciation for what our military goes through.",1412035200,,461,4.25
6053641,4,B00G3D732Q,"I'm not into war movies, but I found Lone Survivor to be a very satisfying film, well apart from the fictional Hollywood 80's action film style ending.  Why the Hollywood studio felt a need to put that on the end of what had a pretty accurate to then account of a real life battle that cost a lot of brave men their lives is mind boggling.  Lone Survivor without trying to give away spoilers so I'm keeping this a bit vague depicts a mission involving four US navy seals that comes undone, a moralistic choice, bad intel and a breakdown with communication devices forcing the four to move into a more vulnerable area.  The four are then forced to use their training to fight for their lives until they can get their communication through to be transported out of there.

Plot spoilers given away from here - The addition of the fictional add on ending plays down the role the Afghanistan villagers (Pashtun) played in the outcome which is a bit insulting to them and ultimately the US forces since they are over to help the regular Afghan people in their battle against The Taliban. The real story seems to be a much better one, than the same old same old 80's style Rambo/Schwarzenegger style film where a helicopter gunship comes in and saves the day and mows down everyone, (both the good guys and bad guys are shot by this helicopter) while meanwhile the hero of the film has a one on one fight to the death combat scene with most highly skilled bad guy left in the film at that point, and throw in the optional little kid the good guy has befriended throwing the good guy a weapon to help him kill the bad guy when he's struggling.  If they were going to make up an ending, at least come up with an original one. Better yet though, stick with what actually happened!

Overall though the film seems to be pretty accurate.  It pays a great tribute to the fallen and even shows you the real life photos of those depicted in the film at the end. Special features on the DVD are lengthy but also interesting and worth while watching.  The families of the three other seals are interviewed and all seem to appreciate the story being told and time taken by actors to meet them so they could portray the men as accurately as they could. Marcus Luttrel himself is also interviewed and we see how he contributed along with some other navy seals to making sure the action of the actors was realistic.  We also see stuff in the extras such as the stuntmen rolling down the cliff.  So they are worthwhile watching and or choosing to buy a version that comes with extras.

You can check out websites such as History vs Hollywood to see what other Hollywood additions to the real story were made and learn stuff such as the real Marcus Luttrell was actually in the film a few times.",1412035200,,2772,4.426326129666012

As callous and boorish as it may sound, the shooters in this flick got exactly what they deserved and should have expected.

6053659,3,B00G3D732Q,"this is a movie that commemorates the many dead special ops soldiers -- three killed on a recon mission, a dozen or more killed in a crashed rescue helicopter -- that would otherwise be hardly a footnote to the dreary afghanistan debacle. and unfortunately it slogs under the weight of its own sincerity. the acting, directing, editing are top notch, but this two hour dramatization lingers too long over treks, ambushes, wounds, escapes, and the inexcusable snafus of military command and inadequate equipment. worst, the predicament unfolds from a really bad decision to let three peasant prisoners go free, instead of tying them up to get a few hours head start on an escape.

cinematic issues aside, three aspects of this story gave me pause. we see much of the story unfold as recounted by the single survivor, who predictably is the one who holds to the highest code of conduct, kills the most enemy and performs the greatest feats of physical courage. this left me wondering what the other three would have had to say about it: but they are dead. worse, several elements in the story are patently fictional -- there was no taliban attack on the rescuing village, and the survivor did not kill an attacker in hand to hand combat with a knife, and he did not leave his protector behind. apparently marcus was found taking tea with mohammed his savior, and mohammed left with the rescue team. this puts every other aspect of the story under suspicion.

finally, while i join in gratitude for the courage and skill of our service men and women, i squirm to see them celebrated for suffering and dying in a war that politicians, out of sight and out of mind, first started and then sent these soldiers to finish. those who start the wars but never fight them continue their work in the shadows, and the ""lone survivor"" style of fictionalized hero worship is one way that they contrive to remain hidden.",1411776000,,1904,4.714714714714715

6053663,5,B00G3D732Q,"I haven't read the book, and I don't know how closely this movie follows the actual events, but the one thing I took from this film is that SEALs -- as special, unique, and bad-ass as they may be -- are still human. They're not invested with super-human abilities. They're not bulletproof. They have families whom they love just like you and I. How they differ is in their drive and desire to actually be put in harm's way. To do the things you and I might wish we could do, but never would because we're more ""sensible."" While we are shaped by the Hollywood mystique of how the good guy always triumphs in the end, because he never misses, his gun never runs out of bullets, and the bad guys are rarely more lethal than a blind quadriplegic with a potato gun. How he can come back from certain death over and over again, and the cavalry always arrives in the nick of time.

I really wanted all of the above to happen in this movie, even though I knew going in that you can't have everyone be a ""Lone Survivor."" Also, the way in which Luttrell was ultimately saved -- not by a single thing within his own power or control -- but by the random goodness of a petrified father who is the product of a venerable ancient culture we fast-food Americans will never comprehend. I'm generally a pacifist by nature, a luxury I realize I have only because of these ""rough men who stand ready to do violence on my behalf."" This trait notwithstanding, I found myself wishing his ""Team"" had executed or otherwise incapacitated the goat herders that ultimately proved to bring about their deaths.

In a day where our local law enforcement, those sworn to defend us an uphold the Constitution, seem to increasingly fight against the very people they're supposedly sworn to protect -- to see this Team of highly-trained killers wrestle with their consciences over total strangers they know bear them nothing but ill will is both refreshing and worthy of admiration.

Perhaps it's just me, but those two points that ultimately have little to do with wearing the Trident are what compel me to give this movie five stars.",1411689600,,2101,4.552910052910053

6053679,5,B00G3D732Q,"There are countless movies out there that pertain to war and the experiences within war, but there is nothing like the movie Lone Survivor. Although the movie ruins the ending within the title, it still engages the audience through out the plot line. I am not one to be into war movies with blood and guts, but this one hit home and I truly enjoyed it. Based on a true story about four Navy Seals who are set out on a mission, known as Operation Red Wings, in Afghanistan to track down the Taliban leader. Throughout the movie Peter Berg really depicts the idea of brotherhood and reality, and it is unbelievably eye opening and touching.
 From the beginning this movie is shown in a way that creates a personal connection with the audience and the characters. In the opening scene a montage is shown of soldiers in military training and during this Marcus Luttrell, who is played by Mark Wahlberg, is narrating. By showing the montage and having him narrate we see how hard these men work and we are able to have a connection and empathize with Marcus. This leads to raw emotions from the audience and that is what the movie was intended for.
 The movie then transitions to when the men are at the base, and when they are there you see this bond of brotherhood within them all. They tease the new guy like any older brother would tease a younger brother, by making him do the dirty work. The guys talk about family, and their lives back at home. What this does for the audience is it makes you feel for these characters. It makes you connect with them on a deeper and more emotional level. This creates the real life scenario that Peter Berg was trying to portray.
  The bond of brotherhood continues even on the battlefield. The war scene is put in a way that it seems so real. This makes the audience really understand what these characters were going through. The sound effects, blood, hurt, pain, and everything in between all seem so real, and the movie did a good job in portraying this by getting up close and personal with the characters.  A lot of times in war, you have to encourage your men, but keep them in line, even when they are hurting. Mark Wahlberg in the movie is set as the leader, and encourager for the men during war. The language and the facial expressions that he used showed that he wasn't having a pity party for the men, he told them to suck it up and keep going. This brought a sense of realness to the character. It wasn't cheesy acting. It was very convincing and powerful.
 The movie did a good job coming full circle. The idea was that it showed the same sort of beginning and ending. It was a tribute to all of the fallen soldiers that had died during Operation Red Wings. Overall this movie shows the ideas of war, brotherhood, and family. Peter Berg did not sugar coat anything. He made this movie for what it really was. There was not a cheesy happy ending, but that is okay because it shows the damages war can cause both physical and emotional. It is a way for people to grasp what soldiers truly face, and how brave they are.",1411516800,,3067,4.409893992932862

Why I gave it 2 stars:
I wanted to get to know the characters a little more than this movie allowed. You learn a lot from just seeing how they operate, but...
I think this story was heart wrenching, and may have not presented as well if it was made as a documentary, but since it was not, I expected more padding to the story.

6053733,4,B00G3D732Q,"A fairly good movie, it has a semi-documentary approach to the subject. What I appreciate most was that it avoided trying to get into the politics of the situation and the war in Afghanistan: it's not about that. It's not about vilifying Afghans, or the US, or anyone in particular, save the Taliban leader who's the target of the mission.

There's not much to say about the plot of the movie if you're familiar with what occurred during Operation Red Wings: it's mostly predictable once you know that, although it does a good job of trying to build up and create some sense of suspense that might work with someone unfamiliar with the tale. For that reason, I won't go into detail about it.

There are a few reasons why I can't give this five stars, though: firstly, it tries a little -too- hard to be neutral, while also glamorizing sacrifice and the ""good guys"" a little too much for my taste. There's little discussion on why certain events late in the movie happen, as well very little storytelling beyond the perspective of the main character. While this prevented confusion, it also led to some things seeming very flat or out of place (such as the detail of rescue operations being largely passed over). The ultimate ending is, sadly, very predictable and not entirely accurate to the best of my knowledge, but it was greatly appreciated regardless. There are some definite Hollywood moments and shots in the movie, but for the most part it manages to be a very accurate, realistic telling of a harsh story.",1410912000,,1515,4.69172932330827

Marcus Luttrel was right, part of him died on that mountain with his team, but they live on through him and the telling of their story. They were all brave soldiers and deserve our deepest respect.

6053769,4,B00G3D732Q,This is a well written story of a situation of which you know the end by the title. This is one of those action movies that moves very quickly and I didn't realize how long I was watching by the time it was over because it was so interesting.  It also demonstrated the life and death split second decisions that must be made under war. I loved it.,1410566400,,347,4.102941176470588

6053774,4,B00G3D732Q,"Well done. I can see how Mr. Lutrell could have said that about a part of him dying with his brothers on that mountain. That would be extremely hard for anyone. To tell their story is maybe one reason why he survived. The reality of the team's cohesion and love for each other as brothers was very well portrayed. The fog of war was also well-portrayed. With all the resources, war can put even the most well planned actions in a tailspin, and courageous men and women die. A very sad scene. As was each loss on the mountain. There's a lesson there about not lumping all Afghan people into one group. That an Afghan village did that for one American shows that there is still some sanity there, despite many years of warfare with one power after the other. It shouldn't be so easy for our politicians to send these courageous men and women to war.",1410480000,,847,4.401273885350318

I will say be prepared to be on the edge of your seat watching through tear filled eyes as you watch the extraordinary courage of these men.  All of the actors did great justice to these men and the type of people they were/are in life.  The extent of the SEAL brotherhood will never cease to amaze me.  Rest in peace to all the souls lost during this tragic and heroic mission.

6053785,4,B00G3D732Q,"Do not watch this movie if you are not okay with graphic violence. I found this movie emotionally engaging and, as a result, some parts of it were gut wrenching and  painful to watch.  You can tell from the title that only one person is supposed to survive so when other critical members of the plot are casualties it is hard but not surprising. I grew up at a time when war movies were in style so I do tend to watch them. Very few have ever affected me like this one.",1410480000,,469,4.086956521739131

Casting is excellent and the acting even better. Locations were well thought out and selected. The only reason it didn't get a five was that the movie suffered on a technical level. The score didn't stand out as anything special and the cinematography and editing in this movie were a little less than I would expect in this day and age. It's no Black Hawk Down.... but then again I guess you can't have Ridley Scott direct everything.",1410393600,,573,4.627450980392157
6053791,5,B00G3D732Q,"The bond of brotherhood among special forces soldiers, operating behind enemy, lines has never been so vividly captured on film. Realistic as it gets! Confirms the old axiom that ""no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy"". Great acting!  Four navy seals make a decision based on morality and fear of prosecution, with fatal results. Can soldiers sent to battle, to do the unthinkable on our behalf, be judged by civilian norms? Will make you think.",1410393600,,460,4.974025974025974

I'm glad I read the book first or I would've missed details about the event to which the book paid due respect but the movie really failed to highlight.  I understand the ""Hollywood"" tailoring but there really was a lot more that should have been done to help the audience understand what those Seals went through and the position that the Afghans that helped them willingly put themselves in versus the nature of the Taliban and what they have done to master terrorizing that part of the world.  Those four Seals, who come from the best group of soldiers in the world, did an incredible job despite being insanely outnumbered by a force that continues to be underestimated.",1410307200,,820,4.835714285714285

I was in the Teams with Danny Dietz and this movie portrays him well, he never gave up and he didn't know the word quit!  HooYAH!!!  Rocks, sand, and radio comms don't mix, so don't blame the man, blame the terrain.  GOD Bless Danny, Marcus, Michael, & Matt!!!",1410307200,,339,4.317460317460317
6053814,4,B00G3D732Q,"I gave it four stars instead of five because in my personal opinion there was a near focus on the F word to the point of distraction. I know some warriors personally and I know that their world and sometimes their vocabulary is to put it gently ""earthy"". But I also know that they are chosen to do what they do not just because they are extraordinarily tough but highly intelligent and articulate. That focus while not totally lacking in Lone Survivor was overshadowed by the sheer volume of profanity. I think a lesson could have been taken from 'Act of Valor' where there was very little in the way of profanity and hard language. In that film, despite a notable lack of hard language no one could come away thinking the SEALS were a bunch of sissies because they didn't cuss a lot.
I was able to feel comfortable allowing my kids to see Act of Valor' but not Lone Survivor  That's a shame because it is a great story of the best of the best of Americas fighting men.
Having said that; I thought the film was particularly inspiring. These men, as in Act of Valor, never give up and think and talk overcoming their opponents no matter the odds. ""Always in the fight""!!!!",1410307200,,1171,4.421296296296297

At least, they should have had the best of equipment, but that does not appear to be the case. The actual participants were fine soldiers caught up in the impossibly haphazard caprice of conflict and battle and broken machinery.

It also detracted from the story that the producers felt they had to make up a horribly cliche Hollywood-style final battle which never happened, including the bad guys conveniently standing around in the open so they could get shot to pieces by US air assets, a scene lifted right out of John Wayne's ""Green Berets"" from 1968.
But the combat on the mountain and the suffering and determination of the SEALs was portrayed in a truly memorable way. I actually found this more believable than certain aspects of the book (which I blame more on the British hack who wrote it, not Luttrell).",1409702400,,801,4.76978417266187

6053893,3,B00G3D732Q,"This movie is doubtlessly used by the U. S. Navy in its Seal Training Program to instruct Seal candidates on what NOT to do in similar circumstances.  There was a foul-up from the beginning when the team discovered that Signal Corps had mapped the radio signal connection strength inaccurately.  The team had NO communications.  That should have ended the mission, or changed it considerably.  Z

Next, three goat herders show up, and unbelievable dialogue (from Whalberg's character, particularly) followed.  ""I can see it on CNN now!""  What???  BS.  Seals don't give a rat's patoot about PR, it is not part of their Military Occupational Specialty.

This movie was right on the mark with the book written by Marcus Luttrell, ""the Lone Survivor""  of the operation. I read the book first a few months ago, saw several documentaries with and about the author, the actors and their reasons for accepting the roles that they played and to say  the least, I was impressed before the movie was released. After ordering and receiving the DVD, the first thing I watched was the ""Extras"". I'm glad that I did because not only gained more of an appreciation of the event, the issues surrounding the event and the families apprehension, grief and closure. The ""extras"" also gave me a better perspective and insight into the actual minute by minute event as it happened the feelings and thoughts of the actors as they portrayed some of our honored heroes.

As usual, we send our best and brightest to do the fighting, while the pols stay home and get fat (always thought we should send THEM to get blown up). In this one, Navy seals are tasked with taking out a Taliban bad guy, deep in Afghanistan. Their cover is blown when they run into some goat-herders ... and instead of doing the prudent thing (killing them), they let them go. The herders rat them out, and after a really furious battle all of them are killed, except for Wahlberg. A whole Chinook full of rescuers are also shot down, and presumably killed on a rescue mission. Wahlberg is taken in by some friendlies (including a big-eyed little Arab boy, AWWW) ... until the Taliban meanies show up and another pitched battle ensues. Then, on the verge of making Wahlberg a lot shorter by hacking off his head (sound familiar?), MORE good guys arrive and save him. All in all, a good watch, just not very politically correct. Move Washington to Afghanistan, I say .... in a year or two the Afghans would be corrupt and not nearly as belligerent.",1408665600,,1124,4.541871921182266

The movie is well acted and the combat scenes are some of the most vicious war action that you will ever see. Outnumbered 50 to 1 and behind enemy lines the US Seals fight for their lives until their last breath.

The film is worth watching if for no other reason than to appreciate the bravery of the men that help to defend this country from our enemies. My wife and I liked the story and would watch it again.

6054064,5,B00G3D732Q,"I enjoyed this movie because I am a sucker for films that are loosely based on true stories and whatnot but after finishing this movie I decided to do some research since I love to find out what really happened because everyone should know that Hollywood adds a bunch of crap that didn't even happen in the movie. However, Hollywood does this all the time since movie watchers these days tend to get bored of films unless it has michael explosions and action crammed into the film. Other than that, this movie is indeed worth watching once but it is forgettable a few weeks later.

This movie recounts the story of Operation Red Wings and pays homage to those that lost their lives in the line of duty for our country. Their story should be shared. This story is not 100% accurate to the book or what happened, it has been hollywoodized some. I won't give anything away but it has been shortened to fit the time allotted for the movie but still tells a great story. Some parts of the movie are difficult to watch the guys endure what they went through and are graphic illustrations of what injuries sustained in war may look like. I'd caution you about watching it with young children. Very intense battle scenes. I highly recommend Marcus' books Lone Survivor and Service that tell his story during Red Wings and after.

These guys are true warriors and heroes.  It takes a special type of individual to do what needs to be done and very few persons are up to it.

I'm just sorry they didn't eliminate the goat herders; as cold as that may sound.  But if they would have done that they might ALL be alive today!

Read the book and see the movie.  I highly recommend both!!!

I really did not know too much about this movie as I was just in the mood for something different the other night and stumbled on this in the new rentals on Amazon. I have a Prime account, but I wanted something that was new and that I had not seen or heard of. This piqued my interest so I rented it online. This had to be one of the most visceral movies I have ever seen. In fact, you may NOT want to watch it if you get to into your movies. I actually had to pause this a few times because it was just too intense. This is probably as gut wrenching than the opening to ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the death of Sgt. Elias on ""Platoon"", or even more so depending on your taste. I thought the acting, the cinematography,  the sound, the editing, etc etc were all just top notch. I saw a few reviewers who thought it was a bit jingoistic, but I did not get that at all. It might be a bit of a US Seal centric movie, but that is what it is. The fact that it really happened just makes the film that much more palpable. If you like true war stories, then definitely buy or rent this one. Thumbs way up.",1407456000,,1236,3.8853754940711465

It was everything Zero Dark Thirty was not - intense, smart, realistic, unforgiving.  It's an amazing story brilliantly brought to life by director Peter Berg.  Once again, Mark Wahlberg doesn't disappoint.  I was on the edge of my seat almost throughout the entire movie.  I don't think I can say that about another non-horror genre movie.  The fact that this is a true story is what sealed the deal, and I appreciated they showed the SEAL team and command realistically - from bravery that is unimaginable, to the ineptitude of the general command logistically trying to get the SEAL team rescued.

I just finished reading the book Unbroken which is also based on a true story of war survival during WWII.  It's an even more incredible tale, and I pray that Angelina Jolie does this book the same justice that Berg did for Lone Survivor.",1407196800,,944,4.63855421686747

The people who filmed this movie and did the stunts all deserve Oscars.  Marcus Luttrell's story breaks your heart.  Mark Wahlberg's cinematic depiction of it completes its tragedy, bringing color and motion and depth to a brave but tragic time for our men in Afghanistan--still a Graveyard of Empires.",1407196800,,769,5.211382113821138

This is based on the book by the same name, written by the lead character, Luttrell.  I have seen him many times on Fox news, mostly trying to move on with his life after this horrific event.  War is hell, there is no doubt.  This is not for children, as you can imagine the language.  At the end of the movie they show the pictures in real life of the men that died.

Hopefully the moment these highly trained killers must accept the moral questions they face might encourage the greater public to reflect on some of the complexities our forces face morally, legally and strategically in some of the ridiculous enterprises they are forced into.
 After they decide their tactical path, they are faced with its consequences.
The battle scenes are riveting and confusing as is the case in combat. I feel the filmmaker's tried to convey the desperation and courage the unit demonstrated.
The greatest disappointment was how Luttrell's rescue by the villagers was scripted.
A TOTAL AND COMPLETE FAILURE TO DEMONSTRATE THE CULTURAL COMPLEXITIES OF WHY AND HOW THE VILLAGERS INTERVENED AND THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH THE TALIBAN.
Typical Hollywood drivel with the cavalry charging in to kill all the ""bad guys"" and no reference to the nuances of cultural/moral conflicts.

We have movies about nonsense that are 3+ hours long....so why not tell this historical, heroic story in the proper length? The four Main Characters did an excellent job representing the warriors they played. The plot makes it look like they were ""on the run"" the whole time when in fact the battle was very different in the book. Buy the movie, it's worth it.

6054477,4,B00G3D732Q,Well I loved Mark Wahlberg in this movie.  He did a great job and so did many of the other characters. However it is not the book at all. It condenses everything down to a few days and that is not what happened in real life. It also shows things that most certainly didn't happen in the book. Like Wahlberg seeing the rescue helicopter shot down. In the book he didn't even know it had happened until after he was rescued. The movie also glossed over the miracle of his riffle. In the book it makes it clear that the author believed that it was a miracle straight from God that his riffle kept landing next to him after all of the long and hard falls down the mountainside. In the movie it shows that once and then kinda glosses over it from then on. I really liked the movie but the book was amazing.

This movie was very violent but the violence is what our servicemen encounter over and over in the middle East, when will it ever end.  What was suppose to be a moving true story was ruined for me because of the bad language.  I can handle it being said a few times but  every sentence that was spoken by the actors in this movie had the ""F"" word  in it.  That word must have been said over a 100 or more times in this movie.  Why do the people who make these movies think that it will make the movie more enjoyable.  Some people do not mind the language but I think it is very offensive especially when you hear it over and over and over in the movie.  Mark Wahlburg is a fine actor but he has a very trashy mouth.  I guess I need to stick with the Disney movies and movies rated PG13.

But this does not detract from the story that is being told about the realities of war, what this country expects from our combat troops, what they expect from themselves. The end of the movie was especially moving when we saw pictures and video of the real Seal Team members and their families as well as the Afghan man who saved Marcus.  I enjoy Peter Berg's work.

6054546,5,B00G3D732Q,This movie was a great storyline and what the actors did to portray their characters made it even better. Many people may have read the book which was written by the survivor. On the bonus features it shows the actors spending time with the families of their characters to accurately portray and honor them. The author of the book was on set helping to accurately portray the scenes of what they went through which at times were painful to watch making it amazing that anyone could survive it.,1406505600,,493,4.613636363636363

If the spoken word or written word doesn't give you the imagery, the movie should help with that.  For me it filled in some visuals of the terrain of what our warriors went through.  This is just one of thousands that we'll never know about.

Thank God for our warriors.",1406505600,,410,4.45945945945946
6054556,5,B00G3D732Q,"First, I am prejudiced,  I enjoy this style movie.  And I read the book before seeing the movie. This would be an ok movie if it came from the mind of some Hollywood screen writer.  That the majority of the events actually happened, move this over the top.  No spoilers given here, just to say, filming it  could not have been easy, so, living it under combat speaks to the individual in portrayed in the film.  If you enjoy history driven ""war"" movies...this is a must see.  The only warning I will give to history buffs.  They do NOT go deeply into detail regarding the people behind the scenes of the operation.  But I recommend this movie",1406505600,,642,4.418803418803419

6054558,5,B00G3D732Q,"I've got to be honest, I just now ordered this dvd.  But the reason I am ordering it and want to own it, is because I had rented it from another source and watched it last night.  The effect it had on me was extremely profound.  It hit me in the gut like Platoon and Hamburger Hill did when I saw them.  You see, I was a medic in Vietnam during 1968 and 1969, and can relate very strongly to these men and their story.  This is an excellent film on so many levels it's hard to give it justice.  THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS TO WATCH THIS FILM.

If you are an action movie junkie and just want to watch an exciting movie, you've got to see this one.  But be prepared to learn a few things about those great heroes that this film is about.

If you are a pacifist, and shun war movies, I challenge you to put your beliefs aside for a couple of hours.  Watch this movie, and think about the decisions that these men made during their mission.  I dare you to learn a little about what men like these are about.
Men like these are the reason you have the freedom to sit safely in your home, go where you want to, say anything you want too.

This movie is filled with scenes that are exciting to those who have been fortunate enough to never face the horrors of war.  For those of us who are war veterans, those same scenes are all too realistic, chilling and familiar.  Some are very difficult to watch for this reason.

To give this movie a typical review, I would say that the writing was very good.  The directing and whole production was top notch.  I couldn't say enough about the actors.  They were superb and most realistic.  The photography is phenomenal and right on realistic.  I hope this movie gets a truck load of awards.

But I can not express enough how much can be learned from this film.  Watch it for the excitement and a true experience.  Then watch it again to learn about the story and the men.  And appreciate our troops and what they do.",1406419200,,1951,4.182795698924731

6054561,3,B00G3D732Q,"I know many just thought this was great but it didn't do anything for me.  It has to do with the writers, producers and there inability to write and direct a script without hardly one word of English.  Doesn't take much if you only have a one word script.  Our men deserve better than that.  They gave their lives.",1406419200,,314,4.271186440677966

6054619,5,B00G3D732Q,"Based upon the book.  The story is a great one and I know the movie is made for entertainment and altered to fit their narrative but I did feel that one of the pivotal moments while manipulated for entertainment purposes should have been followed more faithfully.  The scene I'm talking about is the decision by the Seal officer to let the detained villagers go.  The movie has the Seals in a debate and conflict over letting them go but the book and author are clear that this never happened.  The movie will be more widely known than the book because of the way our culture is now focused on images.  I deplore this because more will believe the movie to be the truth rather than the book or actual events.  I can understand why the author chose to allow the movie and what purposes he hoped to achieve but eventually if a lie is repeated often enough it will become the truth.

The movie concerns a band of Seals who are on the hunt for a radical islamist terrorist leader in Afghanistan.  The group moves in alone to a village to capture the enemy but their equipment does not function properly and they must change their plan.  Once the plan is altered the group encounters an increasing number of problems that affect their mission.  The culmination of their problems is when natives stumble across their group.  A decision must be made that will affect their lives to either let the natives go or leave them to almost certain death.  A decision is made to let them go and the movie documents the decision and their travails after.",1406246400,,1537,4.509025270758123

6054629,4,B00G3D732Q,"I read the book ""Lone Survivor"" before seeing the movie. It was excellent. Action-packed, dramatic, sad, stirring story about four Navy Seals on a surveillance op that went bad. Since it was a first-hand account by the Lone Survivor himself, Marcus Luttrell, the real story with lots of detail is told. The movie is a very good adaptation of the book, one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. It was also one of the most realistic action movies I've ever seen. The scenes of the Seals tumbling down the side of a very steep mountain in Afghanistan were absolutely realistic, so much so that I wondered if I was seeing real people or dummies. I really couldn't tell. If stunt people did those scenes, I don't know how they kept from breaking their bodies. I saw Luttrell and Wahlberg doing an interview on a youtube video and they talked about real explosives being used. I believe it. The acting was top-notch and the actors who played the Seals bore a strong resemblance to the real guys. The only thing objectionable in the film is that the ""F"" word is uttered about every 10 seconds (or it seemed like it.) I usually won't watch movies with a lot of foul language but I made an exception for this one, because the story is true, and I think it's important we know what actually goes on when our troops are put in harm's way. Luttrell has a few cameo shots, and one I particularly noticed has him sitting as one of a squadron of men listening to an officer... When he mentions the ""rules of engagement"", the real Luttrell just shakes his head and looks down. He had much to say about that in the book. So all in all, both the book and movie are excellent, and I recommend them if you can overlook the language.",1406160000,,1715,4.430379746835443

6054669,2,B00G3D732Q,"This is as simple a story as they come. While it's neat to see that it is based on a true story with pics of the real players at the end, really the movie is just one extended scene of a gunfight in the woods. The only real thrills come from the constant moments extolling American honor and enemy-destroying violence.

But the action isn't particularly good. The violence is cartoonishly gratuitous and excessive, with characters getting shot over a dozen times or falling down mountains yet still rising again to proudly fight on. The dialog is only filled with bombastic hoo-rahs or tender confessions of loving wife and country. Perhaps it's somewhat distasteful that this is now a slick Hollywood blockbuster considering the tragedy of the story, but I suppose it's also an honor to be immortalized this way too. But how respectful is it to show the slowmo blood-splattering headshot that killed a real human soldier?

In any event, the movie is ultimately simple and redundant. If ""Black Hawk Down"" is the modern warfare masterpiece, this film plays like a mediocre outtake from a ""Call of Duty"" imposter. Some might tearfully enjoy this flick while draped in Old Glory while downing cans of brew.

6054723,5,B00G3D732Q,I am a Mark Walberg fan and he did a excellent job portraying Marcus Luttrell as the Lone Survivor. The rest of the cast did a great job of portraying the other members of the Seal team too. I watched the movie when it first came out in the theaters and wanted to go back and watch it a second time but didn't get a chance so I had to wait until it came out of disc. I decided to buy the more expensive Blu-ray version that includes a DVD copy and I am glad I did. I think I have watched it about 4 times so far and still love the action. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and your guts will be in a knot during the action scenes. I own just about every war movie ever made and this is one of my favorites. It is a sad story but is very well done and one that needed to be told.

Mark Wahlberg in the cast made it easier to part with the cash to buy the Blu-ray. I kind of follow him from genre to genre. And the rest of the cast is good as well, making the story believable. The writers did their job well, supplying the dialogue to take us from buoyant machismo ""We can do the job!"" to the next levels of feelings, and doubt about their mission. They are warriors who will die well if necessary. Credit goes to the scenes in the village which really fill out the movie and supply us with some things to ponder. They give us a view of the people who live in a ""war zone"" and are at the mercy of the Taliban and the Special Forces who have to try to separate out bad guys from the good ones, who look the same This is a well done production.

Those who have not read about Navy Seals in the past will have a hard time understanding the grueling training that is lightly depicted in the beginning of the movie.  I thought the scenes going to the mountain and when they were discovered were terrific and in line with the movie.

6054949,5,B00G3D732Q,"Based on a true story, Lone Survivor tells the true story of Marcus Luttrell and his team who  set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah, in late June 2005.

Mark Wahlberg, Emile Hirsch and Taylor Kitsch and all the supporting cast play their roles well and thoughtfully.  The action is realistic and the plot tells the story well without taking too many liberties just for the sake of the movie.  Like most true story movies there are some inaccuracies but from what I read, the basic premise of the movie is fairly accurate.

Although it does take a few minutes to get things going, this movie build intensity throughout and is well done, thoughtful, and a great tribute to the men who lived and died while fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Even though you know the true story and how it ends, I was sitting on the edge of my seat wanting to get in the fight myself.  The movie is unabashedly patriotic and deservingly so as these men deserve every honor that we could give them.  Intense and brutal at times, LS does a great job at showing the brutalities and losses of war while at the same time tells each man's story even throughout the fight that by the end you feel the loss as well. Showing the real men in the end in family photos had me in tears at the end.  This movie tugged at my heart and made me appreciate even more what our men and women of the military do for us.  This for me was the best military type movie I have seen since Blackhawk down and Saving Private Ryan.

What became five minutes turned into the whole film... Leaving me sobbing like a baby in the end. I hate to admit these things as I'm not normally a crier and am pretty icy with films. This one got me. I believe this is maybe one of Wahlbergs greatest roles. Ben Foster is also excellence.

This movie stayed as close to the account described in the book, as any movie could possibly do in the short time given to play a film.
In the book, Marcus was protected by the villagers for quite a while, which resulted in a story, by itself.  Out of necessity, the movie shortened this period of the event, but otherwise, kept the story-line very close to how it was told in the book.
On the other hand, the movie can show the images that you can only imagine from the book, and never being in combat myself, I couldn't imagine it  as it was.
That said, I don't really believe that the movie showed the wounds as bad as they really were in the event. For example, from the description in the book, the Seal who was shot in the head, actually had his head split open from the wound, but continued to fight.",1405036800,,976,4.3224043715847
6054971,3,B00G3D732Q,"I read the book first and then saw the movie.  The movie represents about 40% of the book - the action part in Afghanistan.  The first part of the book has the Navy Seal explaining his thoughts as he was going through the training that was geared to bring everyone to their breaking point in order to see which ones chose to continue to the end or which ones opt out.  All of the men who made it to ""opt out"" were extraordinary people to even get this far.  Those who continued beyond the breaking point were the ones the military wanted.  They did not want someone to ""opt out"" in the line of duty/fire and endanger their team.  The movie did portray the US Navy Seals motivation and spirit as presented in the book.
The movie was typical Hollywood which often chooses to censor what parts they do not want.  The author made it abundantly clear that the ""liberal media"" would be all over this team if people who discovered the operation were eliminated.  The Seal Team chose to not take them out and the author questioned if they made the right decision.  The author supported the Team's Leader as did the entire Team.  One wonders if the group had been taken out would the Seal Team stay intact and complete their mission of removing a very dangerous Taliban enemy.
In addition to the Seal training, which Hollywood only touched on at the beginning of the film, the back home scenes were also ignored.  This included the author's entire family, friends and neighbors coming together to support one another and to pray for the author to be safe or found.  Every member of this Seal Team was brought home; only the author was the living survivor.
The author recovered from his injuries and returned to join the fight with another Seal Team.

What I learned from the book and also the movie is that when the human spirit gets beyond itself and moves into another dimension of being willing to fight to die for the Team and for the Operation with courage, integrity, respect, honor, valor and character , it has been refined by fire.  The preparation for the operation began with the training every person must under-go and complete in order to become a US Navy Seal.  In my mind, I recalled eye witness accounts about the SS in Germany and their total lack of integrity, honor, and character dedicated to a cause that was pure evil...............and, then I thought of the Seals who were the antithesis of that evil.  America should feel proud that it produced and produces the likes of these men who are so extraordinary even in their young years.",1405036800,,2547,4.564835164835165

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

 'Long Survivor' is based on the book of the same name, which recounts a small Navy SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance mission to track (and eventually eliminate) Ahmad Shah, a dangerous Taliban commander already responsible for the deaths of a coterie of American soldiers along with Afghan allies. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, the only survivor of his fellow four man SEAL team who make their way into the mountains of the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan.

The film is divided into three main sections. The opening expository section introduces us to the Navy SEALS as they participate in grueling training to go out on these extremely difficult missions (the opening footage appears to be taken during real basic training). It's a little difficult figuring out who's who but the dialogue between the soldiers feels like it's real.

We break into Act II, when Luttrell and three compatriots locate Shah while they're hidden in the bush on the side of a mountain. A sheep herder along with two boys run into the soldiers who now have to decide whether to kill, tie them up or let them go. Ultimately, it's Lutrell who argues they'll be charged with war crimes if they kill the Afghans, so they take their chances by letting them return to the village and then retreat up the mountain.

The bulk of the movie involves the four Americans attempting to fend off a big number of Taliban soldiers who are heavily armed with machine guns and rocket launchers (one of young sheep herders is seen scurrying down the mountain earlier, with the intent of alerting the Taliban).

Throughout Act II, 'Lone Survivor' proves to be wholly an 'action' film. It's extremely well filmed and choreographed, as the Americans heroically resist against overwhelming odds. At times, they're forced to dive off cliffs and end up rolling down the side of the mountains, injuring themselves severely, but still managing to return fire. Meanwhile, they're unable to phone in their position to headquarters until one of the soldiers manages to get to the top of the mountain, where finally there is radio reception. Unfortunately he's immediately taken down by the Taliban, once exposed with no cover.

In some ways, the folly of the initial surveillance mission is exposed. Once their cover is blown, the small surveillance team has no chance of winning against such superior numbers. Certainly, a larger force was needed in the area, to back up the team. Reinforcements do arrive in the form of two manned helicopters, but one is shot down almost immediately by the Taliban and the other is forced to retreat.

Once all of his buddies are killed, Luttrell must make his way out of the area after dark. He's saved by a sympathetic Afghan villager who rallies members of his tribe who resist the Taliban who come looking for Luttrell. The Americans are alerted by a mountain man who brings a map of Luttrell's position at the behest of Luttrell's Afghan protector. In reality, the Taliban did not have a face off with the villagers, as the villagers outnumbered them significantly.

'Lone Survivor' highlights the heroic actions of the Navy SEALS as well as the Afghan villagers who came to Luttrell's defense. Some critics found the film to be light on characterization but in truth, it's mainly an 'action ' film. Mark Wahlberg proves to be talented as a do or die military man along with his assorted comrades in arms. In the end, nothing is sugar coated here. In a sense, the film is symptomatic of our effort in Afghanistan where noble efforts end in failure, in an unwinnable Afghan imbroglio.",1405036800,3,3649,4.870967741935484
6054977,1,B00G3D732Q,What fools sent these guys out to this place? The movie is very touching- but- as long as Hollywood glorifies stuff like navy seals (and I can appreciate it when they get it right- as w Osama-) and sniper rifles and marines- we are going NOWHERE. How about a movie abt peace movement heroes?,1405036800,3,291,4.407407407407407
6054978,2,B00G3D732Q,"Enjoy action - but not much more? Well, then this may be enough for you.  Based upon an actual incident, Lone Survivor is the story of four NAVY Seals who are dispatched to a sector in Afghanistan on a secret op to kill a key Taliban leader. The mission soon goes sideways, however, after they decide to release 3 civilians they've stumbled upon, one of whom then informs Taliban in the area.  Non-stop, intense combat scenes follow between the unit and what seems like all of the Taliban fighters in the world (who, incidentally, happen to be wearing remarkably clean, native costume!). There's little time devoted to anything else in the movie except for the tragically failed attempt of a helicopter brigade to furnish support and the friendly locals who hide the lone survivor 'till the good guys come blasting to his rescue.

The strength of the movie is the more graphic depictions of soldiers in battle which feel realistic and hold the viewer's attention (though the director employed easily identifiable character types and scene settings from movies such as ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""). There's little more that is compelling. While an apparent sincere tribute to dedicated fighting men caught in a hopeless situation, the movie's story is without depth, its method unoriginal and its characters undeveloped.

6055010,3,B00G3D732Q,"The title itself is an unfortunate spoiler that essentially spells out where this film is going and how it will ultimately end.  Additionally, the story is very slow to take of, as this production spends an inordinate amount of time introducing the assorted members of the military crew----their training,  personalities,  backgrounds and family ties.  Everyday life on the base also consumes a large part of the introductory scene.  Violence eventually ensues there is a sentimental portrayal of humanistic Afghans who display basic human kindness in the face of tyrannical fundamentalism.

6055015,4,B00G3D732Q,"One of the very best war movies in recent times. It's hard to imagine soldiers falling down cliffs so hard without worse injuries ...but, I'm a grown man and after watching this film, the special features on the real story and men made me shed tears...it's that good if you can tolerate the horrors associated with war. In a way, it is a horror movie. It's not without flaws however...it starts kind of slow so you can get to know the SEALS's team involved. Very well made, this is no Michael Bay nonsense or garbage flick like Pearl Harbor.  For more facts see:

6055017,3,B00G3D732Q,"Well-made but full of militarist clichs: the good guys have families, the bad guys don't; the good guys can walk on broken legs, bounce up after falling down mountainsides and get shot 20 times without dying, while the bad guys are far more mortal; the good guys are handsome, the bad guys disfigured (no earlobes, scars, etc.).  Product placement for Under Armor and Raytheon is blatant, but the predictable everyone-in-uniform-is-a-""hero"" trope, while present, is quite muted.  Although intended to be pro-military, the movie inadvertently contains a refreshingly discordant strand: if you enlist in the military you may die a pointless death that leaves your family bereaved no matter how ""good"" (character and/or skills) you are.  Should give people pause before signing their lives away.",1404864000,2,792,5.370967741935484

Even though I knew how the events in the movie would eventually play out, the battle between the Taliban and the small band of Seals had me on the edge of my seat. The terrain was much rougher than I had imagined while reading the book and added to my understanding of what the men in Operation Red Wings went through. My intense dislike of the ROE encumbering and endangering our men was reinforced.

6055178,5,B00G3D732Q,"Fantastic (near) re-creation of Marcus' book!!  A must-see, in the genre of ""Black Hawk Down"" & ""Private Ryan"".

The movie feel a bit short (probably got ""Hollywood-ized?) on depicting the 2 or 3 days of Escape/Evasion Marcus went through ALONE, before the Afghan village elder rescued him. I remember reading that he went face-first into mud that jammed down his throat & he couldn't open his mouth or FIND water for like 36 hours.  Also he jury-rigged a radio & made contact with an F-16 pilot overhead, but could not SPEAK, but for the mud jammed in his mouth.  He was chased by several stragglers & sniped quite a few during those 2-3 days . . .
  They kind of combined the ending/rescue, again probably Hollywood trying to keep the pace up.
Still & all, it was VERY well done!!
Reading the book STILL brings tears to my eyes, when Marcus describes the heroism of ALL his brothers during that firefight.
If the movie doesn't get any waterworks from you (at least on the first viewing), you either missed something, were buried in your tablet or smartphone, or you possibly just might need a ""gut-check"" to see if your heart is missing.

6055187,2,B00G3D732Q,"While I get that everyone wants to hail our soldiers, make them look like epic punching bags capable of taking any abuse and smile, and glorify sacrificing your life for any police action the politicians want to do. But this movie really makes our military look like keystone cops. When you push the mute button on the ""Ra Ra, go America!!"" and watch the movie, this is what you see:

1) Recon team sent in to gather Intel for pending operation loses all communication. Ok, why isn't that 'mission over, and return to base'? What good is gathering intel if you can't get the intel to anyone. As soon as the communication went down, the mission failed. Time to get out.

2) You are a soldier sent to fight an enemy (Taliban) and when you encounter an enemy scout team, you down kill or even capture them. No, no, you release them to run down to a superior enemy force and let them know your position, numbers, etc. Sure, that sounds like a good scout team...give the enemy intel instead of getting some (not to mention putting your team's lives in great danger).

3) So, now without communications, with a superior enemy force about to be told your position and numbers, you decide to move to a new location and wait?! What are you waiting for...for them to come attack you? Get the F out of their, the mission is over for crying out loud!

4) So, they are found by the enemy force (as if they didn't do everything in their power to make that happen), and they have to move down steep cliffs to retreat. So the movie shows them jumping off cliffs (sometimes head first) like they are jumping into a swimming pool or something. I can't imagine they are that suicidal, but that is what the movie shows. Now I have hunted very steep terrain (with loose rocky ground) and I have slide halfway down the mountain before, hitting big rocks and suck on the way down. At no point did I have to go into a head first tumble down the rock. But not one, but all four ""trained"" soldiers goes tumbling head first down the cliff. And, of course, the Taliban move down the rocks with no  problems right behind them (no jumping, tumbling, or going head first down the cliff).

5) When they finally lose their first man, they start talking non-sense about climbing back up the cliff they took a header off of and rescuing him.....as if they didn't just leap off a cliff and tumble down almost killing everyone in desperation. Yea, ok, your now going to climb back up with 200 Taliban shooting at you. This is the best clear thinking under fire our training methods can produce?

6) During this whole event, the Apache Helicopters were sent off. Since no other helicopter is allowed to fly, it effectively grounds all reinforcements or any help (if needed) during an activity operation (and pending attack).

The soldiers actions, words, decisions, etc in this movie make our military look like complete morons. I may not be a soldier, but I don't think you have to be to see that this movie is a brainless glorification of 'dying like a man'. Hopefully, our men in the military are not this inept in real life and this is just a poor fictional portrayal.",1404604800,4,3134,4.49560632688928

To further their careers, our political and military elites often put these guys at unnecessary risk. To the elite, hard charging 0-3's and below are very expendable.

It's also refreshing to get away from the typical recipe you see coming from Holly-Wood. Movies these days just seem to get churned out of a movie mill anymore. This movie steps out of that.",1404518400,,459,4.287356321839081
6055194,4,B00G3D732Q,"LONE SURVIVOR is an incredible experience: a tale of bravery and camaraderie, and one of the most realistic depictions of war that I've ever seen. The story is about Operation Red Wings and takes place during the (still-ongoing) Afghanistan War. Mark Wahlberg plays Marcus Luttrell, a Navy Seal Petty Officer who was the lone survivor of the mission. Early on, the movie establishes the characters and gives the audience a sense of who they are, although it doesn't really delve too much. However, it gives enough of a baseline so that when the fighting ensues you care when they're injured and killed. If there was one area where the movie doesn't quite stand up to scrutiny, it's that they could have had some more character development. Still, that's not quite the reason for this movie. It's mostly about the intense firefight that Luttrell and his three other team members enter into when their op is compromised. And it sure was intense and brutal. It was filmed in a way to maximize the visceral nature of the experience and, while occasionally chaotic, was still comprehensible. There was also a lot of well-done special effects with injuries, kill-shots, etc. Here, the filmmakers did a great job putting you in the moment and making you feel the pain these soldiers went through. Overall, I liked the movie which, while never questioning American involvement in the region, does differentiate between friendly Afghanis and the Taliban. There was a touching moment towards the end between Luttrell and a young Afghani boy that was quite moving. Also, before the end credits they have a slide show of the actual people involved in the operation, which I thought was a fitting tribute to their sacrifice. Is it the greatest war movie ever? No, but it is very effective at what it sets out to do, and I applaud it for that.",1404518400,9,1829,4.828025477707007
6055195,4,B00G3D732Q,"No spoiler.

I would have thought more highly of the movie if the director and script writer had gone into at least some explanation about why these soldiers were sent on this mission without someone having done a feasibility/probability map for radio signals in the mission operation area.  If this really wasn't done in the true story then someone should have been court-martialed!  We have lived with the battlefield operational doctrines surrounding C4ISR for over twenty years and there's no excuse for people being sent into the field without a clear understanding of where their comm equipment will work and where it won't.

The movie was well-made, and I thought everyone in it was magnificent, if that's a word that people even use anymore.  I'm probably reacting too much to the utter tragedy and misery of Afghanistan for the USA to be more objective, but I'll close by reminding us all of what we've known for the past 90 years -- WARS ARE WON WITH AIR POWER!

I hope this was extremely loosely based on a true story, because I want to believe in real life the Marines thought of a fourth solution other than the 3 other  mentioned in the movie, even though it was an extremely stressful time. SPOILER ALERT: #4) simply march the goatherders who came upon them out to a friendly rendezvous with the other Americans. Likely no one (goatherders included) would have died, the end. They could have just released the Afghanis when they met up with their crew.

6055205,5,B00G3D732Q,"Really good movie that brings home the story of sacrifice made by those that serve our country in far away lands.  I really think this movie, as other classics like Saving Private Ryan, should be required viewing for the American public as the viewer can truly get a feel for the cost of freedom.  It is gritty and powerful stuff.

Director Peter Berg took great pains to make this film realistic to what the SEALS and special ops forces faced in Afghanistan.  He actually went downrange with a SEAL team to get a better feel for the job that they do, and how they do it.  Further, he took great care to accurately convey the character and personalities of the three SEAL team members that were killed in action on that mountain in Afghanistan.  Marcus Lutrell, the true lone survivor was actively involved in the filming of the movie and actually has a cameo role.

Did Berg take liberties with the story?  Yes, he did.  I've read the book and there are some differences between the two.  However, all the essential facts are there and the liberties that Berg took do not, in my view, detract in anyway from the power of the story.  Michael Murphy, Matt Axelson, Danny Dietz and Marcus Lutrell gave all that they had for each other and our country.  Only one survived, but all will live on in our hearts and memories.  May God bless them all.",1404518400,,1343,4.5

6055282,5,B00G3D732Q,"Barring any soft facts, I found this movie stirring, emotional, and appreciative, that the decision to release the herders was without harm.  However, one does regret that it turned out differently, and the young herder was not respectful of being let go, and the Seals were seriously hurt by that decision.  But that's the American Veteran way.  I have the most respect for the Navy Seals and what they do for this country.

6055308,3,B00G3D732Q,"Really this movie just made me mad that 1. our soldiers aren't more ruthless when necessary, and 2. that Bush & Co sought to run a war on the cheap. While we were enjoying low taxes and our economy was getting ready to go off a cliff, these guys lacked air support because we didn't have enough Apaches there (and yes I voted for him twice). Politics aside technically this was a spectacular movie, with excellent attention to detail & very realistic. I liked that the movie highlighted Pashtunwali at the end as it was worth researching further to try to understand that part of the World. The only negative to the movie was it suffered slightly from Chariots of Fire syndrome.",1404259200,,678,4.565573770491803

Many men and woman risk there lives everyday for our safety back home. I have seen my fair share of bad stuff in Iraq, and this is no less. If you really want a very serious movie that relays the message of modern warfare this is it. You will get a realistic view into the world of what soldiers do everyday on the front lines. The movie is based on a true story and these heroic men in the movie risked their lives without question. Definitely a tear jerker.",1404259200,,608,4.033057851239669

Being in the military and having access to people who I'd bet my life knew intimately the details of the events that occured during Operation Redwings and the members of Lt. Murphy's team or at least Lt Murphy, that the movie accurately portrayed what actually happened. As with other reviews I've posted, it is a Hollywood movie, so don't take it word for word, but the actors and director paid homage to the brave sacrifice of this Seal Team. I was in Iraq during these events, I heard about them, I am not a SEAL or a member of any SOP or SF team.

Would not recommend for young people due to the subject matter and graphic shooting scenes, but it is a story that needed to be told.

They chose the moral way/decision and paid a price for it, but that's what being an American is all about.  Hard choices are just that... hard!

6055400,3,B00G3D732Q,"Basically this is an OK war movie set in the modern age. Although at times it makes you cringe during the more intense moments (i.e. firefights), I didn't really find the deep brotherly bonds that everyone speaks of in prior reviews. It seems that they filmmakers spent about 10 minutes of the movie bonding over their home lives, wives, the new recruit - and the rest of the film spent on the actual operation and final outcome. If you are going to watch the movie for the action, then I think you will not come away disappointed. However if you are going to connect with the characters, I don't think the actors quite got to that depth and they should have spent more time with each other to get a real sense of each person.

BTW, I encourage everyone to take a moment to help recognize all men & women who put it on the line to keep all of us at home safe and free.",1404000000,,868,4.228915662650603

story there is probably nothing truthful in it, so it's hard to judge.

mostly the typical shoot up everything in sight and hate the Taliban ... I

It's hard dissecting American military ops without preconceived political notions or positions, and I think director Peter Berg does that.

Both things in and of themselves are great. But, this movie manages to drag on and delivers a real snoozer in spite of the action.

6055500,5,B00G3D732Q,"There is one obvious plot and story line which goes along with a mission that went bad because of sheep herders.
However, there are a number of stories inside this movie that make it quite appealing to the movie goer who likes to think deep and wants to get the most out of a well scripted movie.  I am not going to give it away, but there are at least three other messages within that really rocked me and challenged my values.
If you watch the movie and not see the other messages, you will probably give the movies three of four stars.
If you have already watched it and missed the sub-stories, watch it again and look for them.  It is a great movie.

6055525,4,B00G3D732Q,"This movie is well made but difficult to watch. The title tells you the outcome and yet you find yourself angry knowing what is inevitable. This movie has been criticized for its lack of character development but I disagree with those opinions. This is not a touchy-feely flick in which the director holds your hand while you get to know the players. You know the main characters 10 minutes into the movie and you don't need to be told these were good men. It is painful to watch it play out. The entire film focuses on operation Red Wing and the tragic losses suffered as a result of that operation.
The movie was filmed in a mountainous portion of New Mexico and the director did an excellent job of making the terrain almost a character itself. The story line is very linear and covers a fairly compact timeline. This movie is a cross between a drama and a documentary. Although the director clearly exercises some license to add a bit of Hollywood to a mostly historical event, the transgressions are minor. Visual clues like the bad guys wearing dark colors and the good guys wearing white are obvious but maybe necessary in a film that moves as quickly as this one.  I don't know if the director wanted to show the consequences of bad war time policy but there is one scene that becomes the focal point of the entire movie. Suffice to say that Clausewitz was correct in his view that half steps in war are imbecilic. This movie shows the extreme cost of half steps in war. Its easy to have flippant attitudes in the safety of your suburban home but this movie will make even the most liberal thinker question the restrictions we place on our warriors.
The movie evokes very strong emotions! I would caution anyone with direct ties to that conflict to carefully consider the impact of watching Lone Survivor.",1403481600,,1813,4.578461538461538

I won't watch it again because of the grueling violence, but it is a good movie for what it is.",1403481600,,331,4.238095238095238
6055528,3,B00G3D732Q,"May be spoilers below.

This was an intense movie.  My family and I sat almost silent the entire time.  You really feel for the characters.  The fact that this is based on real events only makes it more powerful.  A team is given a secrete mission in Afghanistan.  One there, things go wrong.  The men are caught all of a sudden and were not expecting such a fight.  The movie is about them trying to survive.

There is a lot of action and drama in this movie.  You will more than likely find yourself rooting out loud for the guys the entire time.  They do a good job of not really making any one man stand out.  You see them as a team.  One of the best movies I have seen.  I would recommend it to anyone.

Now, if I liked it so much, than why the 3 out of 5?  Well, it is for the fact that it is based on real events.  I mean, this was a great action movie and as a movie I would give it a four out of five.  But, as a sort of documentary, I give it a 2 out of 5.  Thus, I chose a 3 for the entire thing.  The reason is this.  I would much rather have seen something on say, the History channel, about this team than watch a movie that added so much stuff in order for it to be a movie.  I did not feel that way at first.  But, at one point, when one of the men is sitting there, taking his last breaths, I realized something.  How in the hell could they know what happened if this man was alone.  Then, it hit me.  This is a lot of drama added to something that to me, really does not seem to need anything extra.  To hear the 100% true story of these men would be one of the most amazing things Ive ever seen.  I don't feel it really does them justice to add filler.  Some will think I am crazy for thinking that way.  But, it all comes down to personality I guess.  I am going to get something from, I think 60 Minutes about this.  I am almost sure that will be much more informative.

some of the parts where Hollywood took liberties with the real story.  Nevertheless, I think
the real story is still largely intact in this film.  Yes, it is violent.  No, it is not gratuitously
gory--after all, war is a nasty business--especially up close.  One comes away from the
film really admiring the toughness, bravery and dedication of US special forces like the
SEALS.  And one realizes that the ""enemy"" is not so easily defined (like in Vietnam).
And, perhaps, that most wars are not about a ""right"" side and a ""wrong"" side, much as we
would like them to be, but about people with different ideologies, motivations and loyalties--
sometimes conflicting ones.  I found the story quite well-done and moving.  I think the Blu-Ray
deserved more special features.",1403395200,,864,4.876712328767123

This movie brings home the unthinkable work, sacrifice and dedication these brave men underwent during their training and then put to work in following their mission. These brave men gave the ultimate sacrifice for this nation without thought to their own safety.

6055569,5,B00G3D732Q,"Director/writer Peter Berg has translated Marcus Luttrell's and Patrick Robinson's fact based book into a film that is as spot on accurate as far as the training and extraordinary skills of the Navy Seals. The casting is excellent, the degree of uncomfortable banter is balanced well with the sheer terror of a covert op in a way that few directors and actors have been able to accomplish. This is a bloody, crude, harsh film to watch but the audience must be ready to accept that this is the way things were and remain in the multiple wars in the Middle East. And for what? The film begs the question. It is a story of survival and profound comradeship and it jolts us in just the right way.

The film opens with a training camp for Navy SEALS, a fine way to set the tone for the story. The time is 2005, the place Afghanistan. Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg and his team - Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt `Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster) set out on a mission to capture or kill notorious Taliban leader Ahmad Shah (Yousuf Azami After running into mountain herders and capturing them, they were left with no choice but to follow their rules of engagement or be imprisoned. Now Marcus and his team are left to fight for their lives in one of the most valiant efforts of modern warfare. Cut off from back support team (Eric Bana, Alexander Ludwig, Rich Ting, Jerry Ferrara, Scott Elrod, etc) the four struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. But is many ways the acidic cruelty of war is somewhat offset by the compassionate benevolence (Pashtunwali) by a group of Afghans who offer the lone survivor Luttrell succor and safety. Food for thought after the battle of the film is over. Grady Harp, June 14",1403395200,,1740,4.631067961165049

In contrast with other movies that are based on books, this one is not only terrific in terms of casting, direction and visual effects but also 95% true according to what Luttrell has actually written in his memoirs. The psychology of the SEALs, their ethos and battle spirit is perfectly portrayed and the battle scenes are among the best filmed I have watched in recent years. The film is based on the true story of four Navy SEALs trapped in hostile Afghan territory after their mission is compromised. A US Army helicopter was shot down during an attempted rescue, and the film-makers borrowed Chinooks and Apache helicopters from Fort Hood in Texas to re-create the incident for the movie, which was shot in Albuquerque in neighbouring New Mexico.

I first saw it in the theater and it was so intense that I got stressed out. I guess my blood pressure went up because it started to bring back old memory's.

Luttrell was, and that being the case, I'll take his on site narrative over the idiots who just like to mouth off. My biggest complaint about the movie, NOT the book, is that they cast Mark Wahlberg, whom I greatly respect as an actor, as Marcus Luttrell. Why? Because, 1. He can't grow the beard that Luttrell did, and 2. Wahlberg is 5'8"", while Luttrell is 6'4""!!! The difference in size matters a great deal when you realize how much harder it is to hide a 6'4"" person than someone 10"" shorter. It also makes a great deal of difference when someone Luttrell's size has to move, has to fall down, has to shelter behind bushes, trees, etc. The same reason that you don't see 6'4"" gymnasts competing in Olympic games........Size and general appearance aside, the film was very well made, stunts were unbelievably tough, for the stunt people as well as the actors themselves, and each actor turned in very credible, respectful performances. As for the resemblances of the other actors, I think Ben Fox came the closest to reality. But ALL the actors did first rate jobs!

6055598,5,B00G3D732Q,"Wow, a lot of passionate criticism.  There will be negative criticism to any movie, no matter the subject matter.  Yes, this movie is ""based"" upon real events.  But movies are mainly an entertainment vehicle and not necessarily a documentary.  I can and do watch the Military Channel (now AHCH), History Channel, etc.  That being said, my review is based upon how I liked the movie as a movie and not about some political right or left wing agenda that many seem to want to expound.

This movie engrossed me from the beginning, even though the first shot didn't take place until the 55 minute mark.  It is one of the most brutal and visceral films that I've seen in a long while.  Yes, I really liked ""Saving Private Ryan"" and loved ""Band of Brothers"".  This film concerns itself with one ""minor"" incident in a vicious war against the Taliban.  A failed mission concerning 4 Navy Seals pitted against the odds due to a controversial decision in a mountainous and unforgiving region of Afghanistan.  It's a movie that is hard to take at times because of the absolute viscous violence depicted visually and with incredible sound.  Pure and utter mayhem, which is what war is.  Those who have been in battle (my brother in Viet Nam, while I had a cushy assignment on an air force base), have experienced what very few us ever will or want.

This movie runs just under 2 hours, yet it felt much shorter.  I liked the idea showing real Navy Seals going through some of their rigorous training and personal sacrifice at the beginning of the film.  I also felt very somber emotions rising when seeing the pictures of those brave and dedicated soldiers that had died.  It's not a happy film.  It is what it is.  While not a film for everyone (what movie is?), I rate it a marginal 9 out of 10, or a 5-star rating.  It's a movie I'm happy to have in my collection.

Note:  My reference movie for picture and sound quality is ""Oblivion"" (which I gave 10 out of 10 to both):

Picture quality:  9 out of 10:  Excellent throughout and gave the viewer a glimpse of some rugged, unforgiving territory (I wonder where it was filmed).
Sound quality:  10 out of 10:  With the right audio system and a power subwoofer (or subwoofers), this movie will hit you and your walls extremely hard and often.  Gunshots seem to slam all around you, immersing one into the film even further.  One of the best I've heard and felt.",1403222400,,2399,4.513953488372093
6055599,5,B00G3D732Q,"This is simply a great movie, which clearly illustrates the unshakable resolve of some of America's finest and a level of commitment to mission and to team that most people will never understand, much less experience. As a former Army Ranger and Special Forces soldier, I can attest that this film, more than any other, is a testament to what makes folks from that world much, much different than the rest of society. Also of extreme importance is the portion of the film which highlights the friendly Afghans and their contributions and begs the question, how many Americans would have done the same things under similar circumstances? Having served in Afghanistan, among Afghans, I felt a special kind of pride both in the brilliant portrayal of the operators and the highlighting of the demonstration of pashtunwali by the friendly Afghans. This may go down in history as one of the greatest stories about the war in Afghanistan and should serve to silence those who characterize a great people as senseless barbarian radicals.

This one had all the makings for a great contribution to the pantheon of war films, but unfortunately there are some major flaws in this one. First, I thought the casting was excellent, and I found these guys really believable as Frogmen (aka Navy Seals). Obviously it was a bonus watching them work out with their shirts off!  But, the audio on this film is terrible, with half the dialogue (and there is little to begin with) being swallowed by the actors. Turns out it probably didn't matter too much because this film is about one thing: combat. In fact, straightforward fighting (between 4 Seals and dozens of Taliban, then between Afghani villagers and dozens of Taliban) makes up a good 3/4 of the movie. One film critic described this movie as ""war porn"" and I would say my opinion is not that far off. There is very little character development and the plot is simple (based, as it is, on a true story). If you're looking for more than that, look elsewhere. In some ways I'm not bothered that it is mostly just a very protracted battle scene... the effect is that you really get a visceral sense of the hell these soldiers went through. No doubt Navy Seals are badass! And I am very grateful for them, and for their mental and physical toughness, and for their willingness to go where few others would. Unfortunately, however, the Seals don't come across as very smart in this film (they make a critical tactical error which leads to their ultimate demise). And in fact, the ""Lone Survivor"" only survives because he is ""rescued"" by an Afghani villager (what does THAT say about our Navy Seals)? I have not read the book, and probably will now, but I am glad I saw the film. I am amazed at how such incredibly tough men could make such an error (I know, hindsight is 20/20).",1403136000,6,1885,4.463768115942029

If you want bang-em-up and graphic blood with a satisfying kill-the-bad-guy-in-the-end and a noisy fictional helicopter raid, then this is for you.

The families of these men should be proud of them and the same goes to the people in the village who saved one of these men's life even when being told by the evil Taliban they would all be slaughtered if they helped him vs letting them kill him.

6055694,4,B00G3D732Q,"Looks like there's some healthy debate about whether this as good as some other classics. I don't care.

There are men and women out there getting slaughtered, freaking slaughtered. And I'm sitting here watching movies to calm myself down after a tough day at work. That's the pitiful, wretched, laughable perspective this movie gave me, and I am glad for it.

Is it a deep movie? The right question is Are you a deep person? This film confronts you with a certain reality. How you process it is up to you. I, for one, felt comfortable in my contempt of nationalism, statehood, blind patriotism and so on. ""The state"" has caused us enough problems over the generations.

But this film stirred me because it validates that view, with imagery of dead youths at the hands of ideology, yet it leaves me feeling so ashamed. People are sacrificing their lives ""for their country,"" whatever that means. And I know, in a way, they're dying for me. There are people out there suffering unspeakable horror for a bunch of apathetic, entitled, sheltered people...like me.

6055697,5,B00G3D732Q,"Direct combat action gets going quick in this movie.  Would have liked more build up of the characters as they achieved what so few attain, the Trident.  Great intense ongoing action though as the fighting breaks out and doesn't stop till the very end.  Love the multiple persons view of what was happening as everything went down.  Easy to think what could have been done different with 20/20 but real time this must have played out incredibly fast and intense.  Amazing to think Marcus Luttrell survived the mayhem to live to tell the story.  After reading his book and others on this battle the movie does those who died and those who lived justice.

It did not disappoint, granted there were liberties taken for story sake but not badly.  I think they did the soldiers they depicted and the Military justice in this one.  Great job and great movie.

The story gives a small window at what real heroes go through. It also shows what it takes to succeed/survive in life: drive to accomplish a goal, love for others, a won't quit attitude. On the other hand, we also get a window at the brutal and hateful ways these terrorists have to deal with ""infidels"" and those who will not comply.",1402963200,,459,4.542168674698795

I actually had to walk out for a few minutes as I sobbed in the bathroom overwhelmed by my emotions. I can not express enough how this open my eyes to the sacrifice our troops make for us at home. Before I saw this movie I simpliy  could not relate to what has been going on as I didn't  know anyone first hand that had been in combat.

Having read the book, there were some scenes that are in the movie that are factually incorrect, But, it makes it more of an action movie, than say a documentary. I do appreciate the accuracy that the director did try with  the battle scenes based on discussions with Marcus Luttrell.

6055738,5,B00G3D732Q,"I thought this was one of the more tactical, realistic films I've seen with regard to any film about our troops and armed forces.  And it was a great film.  In the case of Lone Survivor, the story focused on a true mission carried out by a US navy seal team in Afganistan.  To be honest, I was attracted to the film because of the subject matter and Marc Walberg.  (He occasionally has pulled off some really superb, top notch performances) Once, the credits rolled however, I saw the film was directed by Peter Berg (try to find one bad film this guy has directed....seriously) and I was all in.  Phenominal movie, but even more important, was the emotion it brought out in me.  Lone Survivor isn't a war movie or an action film.  It's a story about real human lives...and their abilty to fight, struggle, die and survive in extreme and unfathomable conditions.  I heard that the book tells an even more honest story than the movie.  The real story.  But as a movie, Lone Survior still goes up there with one of the best I've seen of its genre.  Thank US Navy Seals for the jobs you do...and thank you filmmakers for trying to share their story in a realistic way.",1402963200,,1165,4.422535211267606

6055746,3,B00G3D732Q,"I know Hollywood wants to hype things up but when there has been so much publicity on this man and his story, they should make it a little more realistic.  Also, with the differences from the youtube interviews to his story in the book and then so many more differences in the movie start making him look like a liar and it starts looking a little fishy with him being the only witness to the events.  The move is alright if you just want to watch a movie.  But that is all it is.  Sometimes, you're thinking, ""come on..., sure it happened that way.""  A little disappointing and had some moments of wishing it would get on with the story.  But otherwise, not bad just for something to watch.  Also, the men looked like ragdolls falling down the mountain instead of having a little more control over their decisions and how they were falling.  The movie didn't make them look like the trained navy seals we hear about.  You wonder if the deceased would like to change how they were represented in this movie.  When the ones represented aren't there, people can say whatever they want and who can challenge it.  It's a movie.  Other than that, I ain't got an opinion on it.",1402876800,,1171,4.420560747663552

It's also the second best movie I've ever seen featuring Navy Seals (the best was 'Act of Valor' only because it featured real Seals). I do think in some ways though that this movie depicted the 'never give up' mentality of good military men even better than 'Act of Valor'. The one thing that I found was a negative of the movie was the location used for it. The vegetation of New Mexico doesn't look much like Afghanistan, and rattlesnakes aren't found in Afghanistan either. Other than that, I would have given this five stars! It should become a military classic....",1402876800,,628,4.616071428571429

While good soldiers did really die in real life I can't help but feel the way this story was told (by Hollywood) was all that accurate. I came away thinking that these brave fighting men and the SEAL's were not cast in a good light when it comes to planning or contingencies. I think Christian Bale would have been a much more credible lead actor also.

The story starts as a group of soldiers goes through the necessary training to become a member of the Navy Seals.  As the pictures continues with the showing of the training needed you realize why only less than 9% of the trainee's graduate from the Navy Seals. The story continues as 5 Navy Seals goes out on a mission that soon goes south and the fighting starts as well as the special effects. This is not your ""John Wayne"" movie as you soon find out.  The battle scenes are very, very realistic leaving no imagination to the viewer on what special forces go through. Academy Award nominee Mark Wahlberg leads an all-star cast including Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and Eric Bana in a movie hailed by critics as unforgettable, tense, and inspiring.  During this mission given to them the SEALs must find the strength and courage to fight to the finish.

Watching this ""Lone Survivor"" will give you a real sense of how these guys struggled to stay alive and might also open a window into the bravery and honor of the Pashtun villagers they find themselves amongst.  Mark Wahlberg acts his part with skill and realism leading the movie to be a satisfying war flick for those that want blood and gore and gung-ho fighting action and yet adding depth and humanity who wish to look beyond the hoo-rahs and body armor at what war can mean to all of those involved.

6055808,5,B00G3D732Q,"I remember watching the news when this was reported. But a movie paints a million words!  Mark Walberg and this cast of actors are so damn believable that you feel you're right there with them.
Incredible story,and  excellent acting.
This film makes you want to stand up and salute ole glory !  Don't miss it!!",1402704000,,310,4.6
6055809,4,B00G3D732Q,Not my favorite kind of movie but being based on a true story made it worth watching. Very well done,1402704000,,100,4.05
6055810,5,B00G3D732Q,"If you want to experience a lot of grief and anger at seeing Marines be killed, then this is the movie for you. I liked every single Marine. I'm angry at the higher ups for not having a better response to rescue them, and I really hated seeing those Marines die. Maybe that's unfair to those higher ups; probably is. Still mad at them! The Marines who died in the helicopter trying to rescue them are just as important to me as the main characters.

It was inspiring and gave me hope to see the Afghans who risked their lives to rescue Mark's character. But the movie is plotless. Don't watch it if all you want is entertainment; it's not about entertainment. The only development in it is when you realize what good buddies these guys were, and their integrity and honor, and their courage. It has Mark Wahlberg in it. Love his acting but his acting is not the point. If you are imagining a gripping story like ""Shooter,"" forget it. It's just about killing Americans, and it hurts. I loved the relationship between Mark Littrell and the little boy. I hope that really happened.

Once in college years ago, I took out a sensitive art student and we went to see ""Bonnie and Clyde."" At the end, the terrible shooting that ended their lives was so bloody that she just said ""Take me home."" She never went out with me again. That is how I feel about this movie. The pain it produced in me was that bad.

I just watched the movie ""Murph the Protector."" That's about the Seal Mike Murphy, same one who gave his life in ""Sole Survivor"" making the radio call for help. Again, it's not ""entertaining"" but it is supremely meaningful. Another movie in this genre is ""Taking Chance,"" about taking a Marine home from the war in a casket. Not entertaining; but meaningful and makes you cry. Now I'll have to get that other film about Mike Murphy, ""Seal of Honor."" These movies go alongside ""Zero Dark Thirty"" on my shelf.

Don't expect a feel good movie. Do expect to share the experiences of those willing to die so that we might have freedom.",1402704000,,2030,4.448924731182796

6055812,5,B00G3D732Q,"This was a very emotional film about a seal team that got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  These guys spend their lives preparing for what they encountered,  but that does not make it easy to watch, or minimize their sacrifice.  If you are looking for a movie about true superheroes,  you need to watch this.

6055813,4,B00G3D732Q,Awed by the kind of decisions we ask men to make under the most extreme situations and the humanity of working things out after making them.  I appreciated the seeming fairness to appreciate the cultural aspect of pashtuntali (? spelling) of Afghan culture. That helps me to appreciate even more the difficulties these men work under knowing they are dealing with a spectrum of people and placing their lives at risk in such situations. Thank you; I wish I could say I enjoyed it; but that is not quite the right word to express my reaction to this film. Not for those with weak stomachs where it comes to physical pain and imagery; but should be viewed for its revealing look at the people we ask to do hard things for us.,1402704000,,723,4.4772727272727275

6055827,1,B00G3D732Q,"I felt this movie lacked a story. It was fine to see all of the fake blood and guts spilling out as well as the gun play. I suppose if you like watching a bunch of grown men who lack an IQ and do stupid things like fall into ravine several times with minor scratches and bruises and ""magically"" survive, then this movie is for you. If you assuming that all of those in the Americans in uniforms are the good guys and everyone else is pure evil, then this movie is for you. For those who want a storyline (which is why I watch movies), there are better war movies that are based from true stories that do a better job than this film that make you leave the movie attached to the characters.

That written, as a movie, this left much to be desired.  I was never emotionally pulled into this story as I was with Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty or Saving Private Ryan.  That is absolutely not an indictment on the true soldiers themselves but on pure movie-making.  I felt much more of a bond with Jessica Chastain's Maya in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and Tom Hank's Captain Miller in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  I'm no director, actor or screenwriter so I can't write what is missing but just that something is desperately missing from the portrayal of these men.  But, as an action movie on a lazy evening, it is mildly entertaining.",1402617600,,798,4.577464788732394

I found the story riveting and even though Marcus Luttrell talks about he will never forgive himself for not climbing up on that ridge (with his broken back) to help his Liet. Michael Murphy, he and his fellow team members are all heroes.  I suspect they killed a high number of their attackers that day.  They were outnumbered and fought bravely and courageously.  It is a story that I am glad is being told through the movie and the book.  I heard Marcus Luttrell explain the reason he wrote the book and allowed it to be portrayed in a movie is he made a pack with God that if he ever got off that mountain, he would spend the rest of his life protecting the memory of his fallen team members.

I recall that day when the QRF was hit in the helicopter and the news reported the loss of all those SEAL's  and air crew 16 I think it was.  My heart sunk then and did again as I watched and the ending is very nice.  A good remembrance to those fallen hero's,1402617600,,325,4.17741935483871

6055860,5,B00G3D732Q,"a movie such as this exists on two levels. It is both a theatrical production and also a story of heroism that is beyond the film itself. Having served as a BUMED officer with  SEALs/NSF, it is hard not to look at this film from a personal perspective. These warriors are truly special people. I found the movie hard to watch without thinking of the young faces of these men, that I have only seen in peaceful situations. My admiration for them, and their passion is boundless.

The movie itself may be criticized for diverting from the actual mission, but then again, it is a dramatic portrayal, not a documentary. It is extremely powerful in that regard. The major fault that I found in the movie was the ending, which did not touch on the role of the villagers in saving Marcus. I understand that it would have made the movie another hour longer, so it is forgiven! Other than that, it was a fine and gripping piece. Not a sensational ""shoot-em-up"" by any means.

Of great importance as well is that in the last few generations, hollywood has been filed with trash actors who would never even conceive of serving in uniform. I give great credit to Wahlberg for breaking that mold. Our forces CAN feel good about what they do, and should have the same respect from the industry that we saw in the period from 1940-1970. We don't have anymore John Waynes, or Jimmy Stewarts left in Hollywood. Now we get bedwetters like Matt Damon. Does he really think our troops want to hear him whine? So, Bravo Zulu to the director and producers who had the courage to make this film.",1402531200,,1572,4.508771929824562
6055861,5,B00G3D732Q,"Its a great story. Its starts with the background brutal seal training, that alone would make you cringe. Later, the story makes an astounding turn - they abandon their assassination mission to spare captured civilians who weren't supposed to be there. What happens next boggles the mind with its brutal intensity. They effect a no holds barred escape down a steep mountain side that is not to be believed, even with the backdrop of their seal training.
The movie surpasses Blackhawk Down. Its all too real, they conserve every shot they make, pieces of them get shot off, bones break and here they still discussing how to proceed with the mission. Deeply visceral and moving.
This movie is so remarkable I got angry with all the flag waving the producers threw in. Thankfully they also reminded us there's also a tribal war over there. Trust me, the flag waving was unnecessary and it keeps the movie from its universal message of personal heroism and of how war is truly hell.",1402531200,,978,4.758823529411765

6055877,3,B00G3D732Q,"Good movie, not great. Inspiring that it's a true story. But it's got a twinge of a propaganda feel to it. It's a bit of hoooh-rah! for the Marines. Which I support the purpose in which they serve. It's just that this film is probably accurate within the context of the soldiers point of view. Although it assumes we are out there killing the bad guys. Sounds great, but that's not really what's going on. There are bad people there and their target was most likely one of them. We can never really know that and further we don't know the purpose of why they are there in the first place. An outline or manifesto is always useful today. Especially when such a large percentage of the population of the United States could not give you a concise, coherent and salient reason why our troops are in the middle east shooting people.

 I did enjoy it. Streamed over Amazon Fire. It looked and sounded great.",1402531200,2,902,4.460606060606061

6055880,5,B00G3D732Q,I LOVE this movie!!! It shows what it takes to be a Hero and to help your brothers when they need help. All four guys are willing to fight and protect each other. Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the Actors did an incredible job in this film. I watch this Movie at least 2 times a day thats how much i like it!!

6055883,5,B00G3D732Q,"America seems to have a never ending supply of brave warriors.  Unfortunately for them their leaders are not too bright when it comes to planning missions that give them a great opportunity for success.  The Rules of Engagement, in my mind, are questionable!  America should never put her warriors in a position where they must sacrifice their life to protect the locals who would do them harm.  In this story these Americans would have had a much greater opportunity to be successful with better rules of engagement and better Quick Reaction Force logistics.  Not being able to send relief for a schedule mission because you had no air cover planned for sole support led to the deaths of too many warriors and too many locals who were willing to help because their code of ethics required them to help the American.

6055886,4,B00G3D732Q,"I think, first off, I did enjoy this movie regarding the quality of the movie (filming, scenery, etc).  I believe they tried to make it true to life as to what the terrain was like, and how difficult it must have been, for all these SEALS, and the job they had to do.
Some parts can be disturbing, so it's certainly not something you want the youngsters to watch (headshots, violent content, etc).
I think it was equally ""cool"" that the REAL Marcus Luttrell was in this movie in quite a few scenes (I won't tell you where, but he's in there).

Now, some other points.

If you ""see"" Luttrell, I'm not quite getting the physical resemblance from Luttrell to Wahlberg, but, eh, it's Hollywood I guess  :-)  Luttrell is much bigger, totally different physique, dark hair, etc.

Spoiler:  According to Luttrell, he didn't engage in the knife fight seen near the end, so Hollywood did spice it up a bit (not new practice in Hollywood, that's for sure).

And to Luttrell if you read this review:  Thank you to you and your men for the sacrifices you endured.  You are men of honor.",1402531200,2,1074,4.489690721649485

6055889,3,B00G3D732Q,"I really wanted to like this movie. It is based on a compelling true story and is well-staged, with New Mexico standing in for Afghanistan, but I was ultimately disappointed.  A recon team of four Navy SEALs, part of what one of them calls ""a cursed op[eration]"" to assassinate a key Taliban leader, is dropped into the mountains near a remote village. They set up their OP and verify the presence of the target, but then they are discovered by three goat herders. What happens next is a cascading series of questionable decisions on the part of the military that lead to first a tragic running gun battle between the four SEALS and a band of Taliban, and then to the deaths of the team sent to rescue them. It is after this gun battle that the movie really lost me. Instead of following the true and inspiring story of how the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was rescued and protected by some Pashtun villagers, a quiet, life-affirming, true to life ending, the movie embellishes this part of the story with a rah-rah action movie Hollywood climax, where the outnumbered villagers battle the attacking Taliban, while the grievously injured Luttrell somehow manages to engage in an extended fist fight with a would be assassin. Will the cavalry (Apache helicopters) get there in time?",1402531200,48,1284,4.783783783783784

God Bless the Soldiers and my fellow Veterans. May God keep you safe on the battlefield, in garrison and when you reenter civilian life and / or retire.  May we realize the sacrifice of the families and express our love and thanks to them in honor of Freedom!  Freedom is definitely not free.  How many more will die trying to stop the those who plot against Americans and Freedom? This is an eye opener! It also shows not all MidEast are bad. Some have died to protect Americans too.

We watched it the day we got it and he loved it. I am not into this kind of stuff.. usually. But it was a true story so I was more interested in it. I really liked it. We have had issues with the digital copy. We downloaded it and then it wouldn't play. My husband ended up deleting whatever was downloaded on to our computer since it was not working. Not sure how digital copy stuff works and what programs are needed, but once we closed the movie and tried to re open it.. it would not play. But the other discs were great.

6055909,5,B00G3D732Q,Let me start off by saying I have not read the book.  Reading the book is on my to do list though.  A local radio program had the author of the book on the show and he stated that he was happy with the movie in regards to the book.  Now the film.  My personal opinion is that this was a really well done movie.  The action is intense and will have you on the edge of your seat and the drama is very well done.  For me watching this video is a reminder of what our men and women are exposed to in the war and it makes me very thankful for what they do and the things they and their families sacrifice.,1402444800,,600,3.7983870967741935

6055949,5,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor's version of Operation Red Wings made me appreciate the military and how today's soldiers have to fight at a disadvantage.

I also listened to the audio book which was almost as good as reading the book, however.  The movie goes too far in it's Hollywood adaptation.  There are so many additional components to this movie, parts that did not take place  during this event.  I thought the best part of the film were the credits when they pay tribute to the operators who lost their life during the firefight, and downing of the Chinook during the first rescue attempt.  I recommend any true military historians read the book for an accurate depiction of this story.",1402358400,2,647,4.5344827586206895

6056006,5,B00G3D732Q,"First, there are always ""liberties"" that Hollywood takes when making a movie to connect the audience to the characters and storyline; however, I think overall the director and actors stayed true to the story, especially when Marcus Luttrell and fellow Navy Seals were providing consulting services.  I am sure they would want the events and their fallen friends to be portrayed as accurate as possible.  The movie is not for the squeamish as it portrays graphic wartime violence.  I think the movie gives the viewer a good idea of what these soldiers endured while being assaulted by a great number of Taliban fighters.  While somewhat aware of the pain and agony they suffered from reading in the news accounts (have not read the book yet), you cannot fully appreciate their sacrifice until you either watch the movie or read the book (I assume).  Not being totally aware of how Marcus Luttrell was ultimately rescued, it provided me an unexpected change of emotion toward the end of the movie which I won't delve into without giving it away.  If you don't walk away from this movie without a deeper sense of appreciation for our military service members and what they endure, then something is missing from your soul!  This movie ranks right on up there with Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and We Were Soldiers!",1402358400,,1320,4.84

6056009,5,B00G3D732Q,"Oh My God! This is one realistic film that shows how difficult it is to be a soldier. As well as showing the humanity of the afghan people. Love the real Marcus as an extra, he's a badass!",1402358400,,188,3.973684210526316

6056036,5,B00G3D732Q,"Showing a selfless portrayal and courage of those who guard, protect and defend our constitution, our gates, our freedom and our liberties was far superior to the way hollywood normally portrays our military.

6056037,5,B00G3D732Q,The movie was very suspenseful with an amazing depiction of a group of soldiers fighting for their lives in Afghanistan. Some of the scenes were graphic.

6056044,4,B00G3D732Q,"For those of us that have served, the brutal deadly reality of combat is not typically shown in war movies, this movie comes pretty close to reality.  With it's mostly accurate lingo, equipment, and operational techniques, this movie takes you on a routine mission with a SEAL team in Afghanistan that evolves into a situation far from routine in great part due to the 50% reduction in force numbers by President Obama from what was originally requested by the Joint Chiefs to carry out continued operations in Afghanistan.
As in most wars, some very tough decisions have to be made that will surprise you, not only by US Military personnel, but also by the indigenous people.  Their actions provide a glimmer of hope for the survival of man's humanity.  What makes this movie even more powerful is that it is based upon events that actually happened.
This is not a movie for anyone under the age of 17 and may be difficult even for adults to watch, but if you can stomach the violent brutal nature of combat, you will be surprised at the compassion still remaining in people fighting and living in countries in war.
And if you get upset about the lack of support provided this SEAL team, don't internalize it or just talk about it, do something.  Write your Senator, Congressman, and President and tell them to either send more troops to Afghanistan, per the original request by the Joint Chiefs, or else get our boys the H*ll out of there.  Their lives are far too valuable to risk by under supporting.
I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 only because I find it hard to love a realistic war movie, I can like it, but I'm not sure that I will ever love it.
I recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 16 who wants to get a glimpse of what war (combat) is really like and just how great the American soldier is that is fighting it.",1402272000,,1840,4.464285714285714
6056045,5,B00G3D732Q,"This movie was a depiction of some VERY brave men. Sad, but done very well.  I would recommend this movie to most.

6056046,5,B00G3D732Q,I have to rate this one for my husband. He loved the movie. I only partly watched it while doing something else. It is really a man's film and I know he will watch it again. Lots of action as all war movies are.,1402272000,,211,3.8181818181818183
6056047,5,B00G3D732Q,"I watched this Movie last night and I thought this movie was pretty Sad, the actors were all Great, this was a True story of how one guy got out alive, and the Good People that helped him, you don't see that often not in those Places it was sad all the other guys got killed, I guess 5 Men wasn't enough to go in there, that was crazy to send only 5 men I would like to know who gave those Orders, it was more of a Suicide mission if you ask me, it really makes you wonder don't it who is in charge, I thought the movie deserved 5 stars, and more.",1402272000,,547,3.807017543859649

6056053,5,B00G3D732Q,"As good as the movie is/was, you've GOT to read the book.  Long book, but an easy read.  It fills in all the gaps, and describes the conclusion in much better details.",1402272000,,167,4.1875
6056054,5,B00G3D732Q,"I loved this movie. It was made with one idea in mind, showing just how tough Seals are and how brutal combat in Afganistan is.

They do not pull punches. This is not your typical movie about American military might where the good guys overcome all odds and send the bad guys running. Make no mistakes, the Seals lose in this story. Many are killed, and worse than that (from the perspective of the Seals) is that the mission didn't get accomplished. This battle was an all out loss by the US. You don't see that in major film much.

But that's the reality. In real life even the mighty United States Military and it's Spec Ops don't win every time. Most times, but not all. And when we lose it's brutal. This movie does a great job of showing how dangerous fighting the Taliban is. But it also shows how important it is and why men risk their lives to do it. And finally, it shows just how tough Navy Seals are. A normal person would have died 6 seconds into the initial attack from the wounds these guys suffered. Most of us would have been so crippled by the pain that we would have gone into shock and died almost immediately. But Seals don't feel pain or give up. They just keep pressing on until their bodies physically won't work anymore.

It also shows that Seals aren't just dumb thugs with superior fire power and extra guts. They are not battlefield thugs. They are highly dedicated, smart, thinking, planning weapons. They know their enemy because they study their enemy until they know everything about them. They understand the place their emeny has in the larger scheme of the war. They are educated and precise. Not dumb and trigger happy.

I spent 6 years in the Marines. I've worked with Seals. This is how these guys really are. They party hard when there's not work to be done. But when there is you will not find a more focused group anywhere on Earth.",1402272000,,1873,4.436046511627907
6056055,4,B00G3D732Q,"Excellent movie, but would have been better had they cast (insert random actor's name), in place of Marky Mark.  Just Sayin'.",1402272000,,125,4.9523809523809526
6056056,5,B00G3D732Q,Non stop action and if this is even remotely real the seals are ridiculously tough. Really enjoyed watching this movie,1402272000,,118,4.95

6056062,4,B00G3D732Q,"Incredibly realistic battle scenes, with untold casualities - a bit overdone and too drawn out. Hard to believe their communication equipment failed and left them stranded.

6056064,4,B00G3D732Q,A powerful story about the dangers of combat and it's true heroes. At times gut wrenching and emotional. One of the most real firefights in a war movie. Sometimes we have to be reminded of the sacrifices made by those who fight.,1402185600,,228,4.4523809523809526
6056065,5,B00G3D732Q,Excellent. A great look into the sacrifices that are made by our servicemen to keep America free. The prices paid for getting terrorists.,1402185600,,137,5.0
6056066,4,B00G3D732Q,While I loved the movie . . . the book by Lattrell gets the full 5-Star Rating.  SEALS ARE GREAT !!!!!,1402185600,,102,3.857142857142857
6056067,5,B00G3D732Q,"I admit I'm a huge fan of War films and this incredible movie goes right to the top of the list of the great ones I've seen/own. Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, 12 o'clock high, Tae Guk Gi to name a few. It starts slow and I was a little worried it wasn't going to be compelling enough, but oh man, does director Peter Berg know how to make a great war film. The story follows the mission of the 4 man seal team recon unit and what happens to them when it all goes bad 40 min into the film. I did not know the last 10% of the movie would involve the rescue of the ""Lone Survivor"" aided by local citizens and that just took the film to a whole other level of greatness. This was an amazing, gut-wrenching, movie that will be highly valued in my collection.",1402185600,,776,4.078431372549019
6056068,4,B00G3D732Q,"This movie depicts a war within all of us: Good morals versus our survival instincts. In the end, the survivor is saved by the good morals of others. Good morals should always win. Great movie!",1402185600,,193,4.542857142857143
6056069,1,B00G3D732Q,"It was a terrible movie.  Acting was bad, and the story wasn't believable.  It's claimed to be based on a real story, but clearly many parts were simply made up.  Would not recommend.",1402185600,,183,4.484848484848484
6056070,3,B00G3D732Q,"Before going further, need to state have spent time in Afghanistan, in the north, far outside of Kabul, as a civilian. It was before the present conflict, but the experiences had there left a lasting impression. e.g., vehicle we were driving got stuck in a river, frozen over, in the middle of the night, with temperatures in the '20's. A group of Afghans walked about two miles, several times, to help pull us out of the river. They weren't very happy about it and thought we were stupid to be there in the first place, but they did it. What I didn't enjoy about the movie was how the guy who helped Luttrell was basically left hanging, after his village being attacked- thanks for helping me at extreme peril to your personal life, have a nice day. I would have felt better about the whole story if that had been taken explained at more detail than leaving it as a Disney detail in which, ""things just worked out."" Otherwise, it's a riveting story of some guys who went out on a mission, had to make a tough choice, then all s*** breaks loose. Plus, that damned radio. How wonderful it doesn't work with a mountain in the way.  Crazy. The footage going off the cliff is painful to watch.  But you don't go in to the SEALS for the chocolate brownies, do you?",1402185600,3,1259,4.399141630901288
6056071,5,B00G3D732Q,Great movie.  I knew the story prior to watching the movie and I think it was really well done.  The directing and acting was superb.  I highly recommend the movie.,1402185600,,164,4.4
6056072,4,B00G3D732Q,"In a nutshell: well acted, intense, and quick paced. I found myself full of anxiety and nervousness, therefore, mission accomplished. If you are a fan of war films then don't expect this film to be that. It is mostly a survival story that will help you appreciate the sacrifices these soldiers make. Definitely worth watching as a tribute to the men and women who were involved in the actual event.",1402185600,,398,4.7
6056073,5,B00G3D732Q,"Excellent recreation of events that bring pride and honor to the participants and shame and disrepute to the Taliban and their enablers; most specifically the USA's political echelons.

I salute all the people who have gone to fight for freedom and the Hell they have gone through.  These guys in this movie knew, and lived for their fellow soldiers would come to look for them and find them if possible.  Some would say the training for the Special Forces needs to be tamed, but I would say if it were not for this training, they would not have survived as long as they did.  This was a great movie, up there with Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers and Longest Day, to name a few.",1402185600,,620,4.049180327868853
6056082,4,B00G3D732Q,The version of the survivor who was badly injured and barely survived - so the controversy of what was said or done is expected - bottom line - the error was in letting those sheep herders go - clearly they were Taliban and had a radio in a remote area where poverty was rampant. In hindsight there were so many things wrong with this mission and how it was handled that was so tragic for all involved. The movie was a bit long - but very well done.,1402185600,,449,4.113636363636363

Everyone should view this and realize how we tie the hands of our fighting men and how politicians who send us to these God forsaken places get in the way of real victory. This shows that we are in a war. We should be allowed to fight like a war or come home and stop maiming and wasting our young men. This movie shows it all.,1402099200,,478,4.042105263157895

The actors were very impressive and their physical actions really quite remarkable.  There is one scene (long one) in which the four Navy SEALs are running and jumping down the side of a rocky mountain terrain.  They hit, bounced, tumbled and I don't see how they didn't end up in the hospital.  What the DVD offers is a a feature section in which the Writer-Director and the actors visited the families of the story's protagonists.  You learn a lot about the kind of American men these heroes really were.  That section alone is worth the cost of the DVD and something you're not likely to see any where else.

American support is either unaware or unable to offer help in time to save three of the four men - the title clues you into this.  Not politically, but militarily similar to other Great Power misadventures from history.  Tough to watch.

6056144,1,B00G3D732Q,No character development at all. Too many military terms that the layman doesn't understand. I know this story is a Wonderful real life story but Hollywood wanted to make money off of it and did it with violent battle scenes which I am sure were very true to life but I never did know who the brave heroes in the story actually were. Oh yes after the movie we got fleeting glimpses of the real heroes but they were not properly identified in the movie or fleshed out so that we could feel for them as they went into battle. The only part of the story that was really made clear was when Marcus Luttrell was rescued and saved by the villagers.,1402012800,4,642,4.270491803278689

6056147,4,B00G3D732Q,"It is difficult to explain exactly how I felt after viewing this vividly graphic film. I had deep feelings of remorse for Lutrell's buddies who did not survive. My ambivalent feelings toward the Taliban have simply increased tenfold. These people are not our friends by any stretch of the imagination and anyone who actually believes we can negotiate with these screwed up people are at least twelve bricks shy of a full load. That being said, I realize I was actually emotionally drained after watching it. It was a horrible reminder of what our young men face on a daily basis. Our boys hands are tied behind them when it comes to rules of engagement, because of some politically correct nimcompoots in Washington, who have never served in the armed forces during their lifetime and have no earthly idea of what actual combat is like. They do our armed forces and their country a disservice and I put them in the same classification as I would anyone who would deliberately put our troops into harm's way with their hands tied behind them... the enemy.  I do recommend that every young man over the age of 17 see this movie. It is not for children or the squimish, or anyone who has a weak stomach.",1402012800,,1200,4.607476635514018

My son was a Marine sniper for five years and I just kept thinking how it must have been for him and his brothers....I just cannot imagine going through this kind of training and then the missions they were sent on...  SO if you like intense and emotional this was good.  All the actors were great.  Mark Wahlberg is one of my favorite actors.  I don't know why we have to have war but it is what it is and men and women continue to be the bravest of brave.  My heart goes out to all and I am truly grateful for those who have served, serve and die for what they believe is the right thing to do.

It is hard to believe that someone did not die while doing the stunts in this movie. At the very least, there must have been many bones broken after the stunts. The cinematography is another high point in this movie if you can appreciate a mountainous area. The movie gives you a better understanding of what our soldiers go through, especially the ""Special Operators"", while performing the most hazardous duties. It also demonstrates the human spirit, camaraderie among soldiers and what it takes to become a  Navy SEAL.

6056157,4,B00G3D732Q,"Many of my veteran cohorts did not want to see this, right off.  Too much pain, they said, seeing the best of the best go down in battle.  They were heartened to see the Afgan villagers helping the wounded American and stannding toe to toe with the Taliban butchers.  They said it was typical of US forces to deliberate their own fate when confronted with the choice of protecting themselves or living up to their ideals and holding fast to the standing rules of engagement.

Walhbergh doesn't do it any better. His fellow actors did their characters justice, as well. This film honors our men and women in uniform with graphic images of their sacrifices.  We need to know this stuff and remember it.",1402012800,,700,4.612903225806452

6056160,5,B00G3D732Q,"This film was so humbling to watch and made the three of us who watched it together realize what a cushy life we lead...none of us in our youth, in the best condition we've ever been in, would have survived more than 5 minutes of the regimen the Navy Seals depicted in this film experience regularly. It also made us realize how fortunate we are to have such a fine military, especially the elite units, such as the Seals. Peter Berg the writer/director was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded...this was the finest military film - my opinion - since ""Saving Private Ryan"", just a couple of clicks better than ""Black Hawk Down"". It is based on a failed mission, Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan in 2006, as documented in a book written by the ""Lone Survivor"", Marcus Luttrell. Having read the book I can say the plot follows Luttrell's story closely...there are only a couple of significant differences taken for dramatic effect and not worth mentioning. The mission was compromised - and ultimately failed - because the four-man Seal team was discovered by a goatherder and his two sons; and because of the decision - the right decision regardless of consequences - to let them go. Mark Wahlberg, in his best role to date (again my opinion) stars as Marcus Luttrell; and he receives outstanding support from Ben Foster, Taylor Kitsch, and Emile Hirsch, who play the other three Seal team members; and Eric Bana who plays the mission commander. This is not an easy movie to watch; but then neither is any good war movie...this is one on the best in that genre and carries my highest recommendation!",1402012800,,1619,4.704225352112676

6056170,5,B00G3D732Q,"This is probably one of the better military/action movies I have seen.  Firstly, the story of the frogmen from SDVT 1 & 2,  Seal Team 10 and the Night Stalkers of the 160th SOAR is very well told. Obviously there are things that have been altered from the real story that it is based on, but what Hollywood film based on a true story does not. Most of the main and important details are here. I think the technical aspects are top notch. It is clear the main actors were put through a good amount of training as their movements and actions are very realistic. The main plot of how the folks in our military, especially those in special ops, form a bond stronger than most can imagine, is extremely well represented. This story was not as well known or publicized as it should have been back in 2005, so I'm glad that it is getting more attention. Maybe the only thing that was omitted that should have been in the film was giving some credit to the the Marine battalion who did much of the planning and information gathering prior to SOF becoming involved.

6056178,2,B00G3D732Q,"Sorry, but this is a really poor movie about an important subject and story. First of all, the movie deviates from the book--which has its own share of issues as discussed by veterans with more credibility on the event than myself--and tries to make the story into the traditional ""at the last minute the cavalry shows up and saves Luttrell"" which is not what happened. This type of rewriting of the story just makes it a weaker story.

It looks like it was made fast and cheap. For example, the director just pulled excerpts of the Discovery channel's 15 year old documentary on SEALs to show BUDs training . You can watch those scenes on YouTube for crying out loud ..

On top of that Wahlberg is good at comedic roles but is horribly miscast here. He can't even fake a Texan accent and in the scene where he discusses texas with the Afghani kid he talks about Texas with his ""baw-stone"" accent. Plus he's almost 15 years older now than Luttrell was at the time of the story and is too old to play this character.

And why do they have the real Luttrell appearing in shots as a SEAL background extra?

And the worse thing is that the endless camera time spent on watching the four SEALs get shot and shot again and break their backs against rocks -- well, it veers into violence porn to say the least. Why not spend more time exploring why these guys made the (unfortunate) decisions that they made? Why not explore why an Afghani man would risk his life to save an American he didn't know? Why not follow Luttrells own struggles with PTSD when he returned home (struggles that have been quite public )?

Instead this movie just comes across as a product cranked out as fast as possible by a studio. Disappointing .",1401926400,4,1717,4.455414012738854

6056181,5,B00G3D732Q,"I listened to the audiobook and had heard great things about this film when it was released. The film did not disappoint one bit. As with Peter Berg's other films (e.g. The Kingdom) it's easy to lose yourself in the intrigue and action. The fact that it's based on a true story, written by the man who lived it, and (along with some of his Navy SEAL brothers) worked as advisors on set (and even played small bit parts, look closely at the unnamed SEALs in early scenes to see Marcus Luttrell).

As with most films, much is omitted from the book. Not a criticism, just a recognition of film's time constraints, but the extra features include some of his early days growing up and SEAL training discussed in the book. Watch the movie first, then the features and the book. The movie feels very fast-paced (gives the appearance that he was rescued much sooner than actually happened) but if you go from from film to book, you'll get more as you go along, and won't notice what's missing.  Great story of true heroism faithfully depicting the brotherhood, sacrifice and honor of the SEALs and the Afghan villagers who risked their own lives to protect an American from the Taliban fighters searching for him.",1401926400,2,1205,4.626168224299065

let me say this to every person now I don't care how you feel about the war in Afghanistan but no matter how you feel this is a incredible movie that should been seen by everyone. It details the courage and cost of a seal operation called operation red wings that left three seals dead one near death and sixteen rescuers dead. The movie from the action to the scenes to the actors go way beyond portraying the seals in the firefight and also how they acted moved shot and died for the friends next to them. Besides the movie the extras are ok but the jewel of tem all is the Will of the warrior which details marcus lutterells path to operation redwings and how he became a seal. although a close second is the tribute to the fallen of operation redwings which talks about all the fallen soldiers of the failed mission.

The action scenes (watching these warriors trip/roll their bodies down a steep mountain made my own spine ache!) have never been rendered as realistic due in part by the director and cinematographer.

6056203,5,B00G3D732Q,"The book was inspiring and enough to bring you to tears.  The dedication, training, loyalty and courage of these men makes you very proud to be an American.  I was dismayed to see them put at the great disadvantage of the rules of engagement.  We take the finest, train them and then expose them to needlessly hold their fire in the face of a clear and present danger. Thus we risk for the sake of PC the very lives of those on whom we rely in the most dangerous situations in their task of protecting Americans.  The movie follows the book closely and deviates mostly where it is necessary to condense.  The acting was great but I did not feel the same sense of loss and grief that I did with the book.  This is partly because of the writing and directing I believe.  I also think that not enough time in the beginning was used so we could individuate and get to know and recognize each personage, which in turn detracts from the dramatic impact.  The photography was great but the book gave me a much clearer picture of the ordeal and courage under fire of each man.  I am not a director and thus can't know what all was needed to convey what we saw and felt in the book, but it strikes me that the powerful emotional impact was simply overlooked or thought ""too patriotic"" to appeal to the public, or what is more likely the writer and director chose not bring these things out because of a liberal bias.  That is too bad because that is the same outlook that imposes on our military the rules of engagement and ties one hand behind their backs.
Apart from these observations I thought tha the execution of the action was great.  In my mind this movie rates five stars because what was done was well done and that the public needs to know the tragic extent of the sacrifice these men are making.l",1401840000,,1799,4.340298507462687

After reading the book twice (yes, it's that good!), I was seriously let down by how the story was told on the big screen. They left out so many key plot lines and it felt thrown together. For a 2 hr movie it flew by, so I assume they were limited by runtime more than anything in terms of what to edit / cut out.

On the positive side, there were some amazing aspects to the film:

- The location they chose for the mountain scenes looked amazing and brought the story to life
- The dedication of the actors to learning as much as possible in advance about looking/acting like a SEAL

The cast led by Mark Wahlberg (also produced) (as Marcus Luttrell) is excellent. The directing & screenplay (based on the novel by Marcus Luttrell & Patrick Robinson) by Peter Berg (also produced) is excellent.

The music by Explosions In The Sky & Steve Jablonsky is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias Schliessler is excellent. The film editing by Colby Parker Jr. is excellent. The casting by John Brace & Linda Lowy is excellent. The production design by Tom Duffield is excellent. The art direction by Steve Cooper is excellent. The set decoration by Ronald R. Reiss, set designs by Derrick Ballard & set dressings by Ram Goradia, Vincent Luizzi, James Sapienz, David Thompson & Robert P. Trujillo is excellent. The costume design by Amy Stofsky is excellent. The make-up effects by Howard Berger & Gregory Nicotero is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Kevin Scott is excellent. The special effects supervised by Bruno Van Zeebroeck is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Harrison Marks & Zuzana Mikus & supervised by Grady Cofer & Jesper Kjolsrud is excellent.

This is an excellent, well-crafted and well-paced film that is entertaining and well-done. This is also an impressive film, thematically, emotionally and visually. Mark Wahlberg is solid as usual as Marcus Luttrell. Peter Berg has possibly made his best movie to date, thus far.

6056228,5,B00G3D732Q,"This movie, based on a real incident in 2005, places one in awe of the Navy SEALS, the special forces, and all military personnel that have sacrificed a portion of their lives to defend this great nation.  The technical aspects of this movie are well done and uniforms and equipment are authentic, thanks to the director using good judgement in following the advice of the SEALS.  When a movie gets the audience as involved in the action as does this one, it is clearly well crafted.  When the men are forced to literally fall/jump off the mountain, the pain and agony of each impact causes the viewers to moan. The bravery of our soldiers is on display as each of them makes sacrificial moves to save each other.  This  especially demonstrated by Lt. Murphy  when he makes the decision to go to the high ground to call for help, knowing that he will be an easy target for the enemy and likely will not survive.  The killing of the SEALS is a little gory, but it lets us know that war is not glamorous but ""all Hell,"" as Gen. Sherman said long ago.  This movie should make us think carefully before committing to war as a political alternative, and placing our young women and men in harm's way.  This movie well certainly go down in the annals of being one of the great war movies.

That being said, certain events in the  movie deviate somewhat from the official action reports and the book upon which it is based (Lone Survivor, by Marcus Luttrell), but after all, this is a dramatization of an actual combat event and we should allow the screenwriter to exercise at least of modicum of poetic license.

So, get the movie, raise the flag, and thank God that this nation still has people like the SEALS to defend our freedoms.",1401667200,3,1728,4.485623003194888

6056247,5,B00G3D732Q,"This is a good movie, but an extremely sad one. It is also MORE than a Movie. This is as real as it gets. The decision these 4 heroic men chose was the most moral, Christian, courageous and sacrificial one that they shouldn't have had to vote on. They have their codes and are the most honorable men in every day life, this is above and beyond. This is also very personal to me, because I know a man just like them.

They had a mission, and it was for our country and the 20 Marines murdered the week before ~ something that has been left out of all of the many reviews I've read thus far. If the Americans would stand behind them And Not Forget everybody wanted us over there IMMEDIATELY after 911 ~ they'd have been able to do what they knew should be done to begin with. They Shouldn't have let them live and didn't have to, but our Sick Media and all of the Ignorant Americans were the cause of their decision. They knew making it out was slim to known. It WASN'T 40 Tali's, it was closer to 150 to 200 of them and they would've cut their heads off if they had the opportunity. Americans would have been outraged with them, but had they killed them and saved their own lives ~ they'd have been CRUCIFIED BY THIS COUNTRY.  They were basically ""Lambs Led to Slaughter,"" for a lack of a better way to put it.

Marcus Luttrell was a hero then, and he is a hero every time he wakes up. He tells this story over and over to Honor his Lost Brothers. And he re-lives it everyday. He went to see all of their family members as soon as he was able to ~ look their mothers and wives in the eye to tell them they didn't suffer. He couldn't tell them everything that went on up there on that mountain. My heart aches for him and always will.

The movie is Authentic because he was involved with the making of it, as it should have been. He's in more than one scene in the movie too. He also had real SEALS come on the set to make sure it was real. The movie was long, but for those who haven't read the book and doesn't know anyone involved in actual parts of this will never be able to fathom the length it would've been, nor how much worse it truly was for them. Everyone that watches this, definitely needs to read the book. And for those who have compared this movie to Platoon is living in La La Land. If it were to be compared to any movie, it would be Black Hawk Down and the 160th SOAR helicopter pilot Michael Durant who wrote the book about it. And the 2 Delta Force men who gave their lives to save him (and acknowledged that was probably going to happen).

EVERYONE needs to remember this is REAL LIFE NOT JUST AN AWESOME MOVIE.

I have a to say my heart and prayers go out to all of them everyday. Also, after seeing the movie, Axes mother went up to the actor and thanked him for giving her a couple of more hours with her son & I've seen an interview with Her & listened to it come out of her mouth with tears running down her face. I cannot put my name on this, but I would if it were possible.

Thank you Marcus for showing us what is Real Honor, what a Real Man is, what a SEAL is and what Our Country Means to You. And I thank the village for standing up for him,as well as saving him. That is Real a Honor and Courage that most people Do Not Have.

Think about these things as you watch his movie and read his book. My thanks goes to the actors for doing such a great job, and it shows it wasn't all about the money they made to do the film.

6056248,2,B00G3D732Q,"By the time this movie was released, it appears that we have lost the war in Afghanistan because the Taliban wouldn't bow to American supremacy. While the quality of the movie-making is commendable, the script seemed to be pulled right out of Bravo Two Zero and The One That Got Away 'we're the good guys' story. We need to remind ourselves that Lone Survivor really is Hollywood's attempt to rally public support for overseas American adventure. What the film won't tell you is the hasty bombardment of the village soon after, killing innocent women and children. What happens if a terror organisation kills thousands of American women and children? We did just that in the Mid-East. Just do the body count. Try watching the real ""Operation Red Wings"" called ""War of the Oppressed People"". War is hell but making such a movie should make us demand the real reasons behind 9/11 and for a trillion dollar war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In any case it is a good depiction of where our military's warrior ethos has ended up....rightly or wrongly. I certainly wasn't there so I'm not going to judge their tactics and final outcome. I did see Luttrel on a documentary state that in hindsight after the loss of so many SEALS that he would of eliminated the goat herders and not compromised the mission.

When I was in the Marine Corps the mission was always stressed as being the priority....period! Before men or material loss considerations.

Voting whether to compromise the mission or not? Unheard of.

But times and military morals and rules have changed I reckon so we have to be prepared to accept the accompanying results.

Worrying about what CNN would have to say about the SEALS??? Somehow I don't think SEALS really worry too much about that...at least not to the point of effecting a real world on going mission. At least it shouldn't. But we're not fighting with WWII rules.

Based on the true story of four Navy SEALs whose covert operation goes terribly wrong in Afghanistan and they find themselves hemmed in by overwhelming Taliban numbers.

What did we think?

A surprisingly touching piece that depicts not only the bond between soldiers but the gruesome nature of modern warfare and the difficult choices faced. An unexpected focus on the human side of the SEALs made this war movie quite relatable and a startling twist late in the film will have you believing in humanity again - and possibly worrying for the innocents caught up in these wars.

What a waste of good manpower, not to mention how much it cost to train each man. Although I enjoyed the movie and love what Mark Walhberg does in the role, I can't get past the waste and expecially being supplied with overwhelming, state of the art gear and weapons, they still fight against an enemy much less equipped but none the less very equal to the task.

6056280,5,B00G3D732Q,"Although the movie was great to watch, there were cinematic parts designed to enhance the overall scope and reality of the movie itself and this is something that did not sit well for me. I just wish they (Hollywood, DOD, CIA and Washington) allowed what truly happened to be portrayed. it was a situation that many politicians and policy makers were really to blame for this senseless loss of true patriots and hero's and yet one lived to tell the story, something I thought they'd never let happen. But, someone gains while others lose. typical.",1401321600,4,547,4.768421052631579

Walberg a character and not much more. Would have been interesting or more so if he had not been the Lone Survivor. Date movie?  Don't think so. Viewing with spouse?? Don't think so. Children? NO.

When those who have never been to war criticize our fighting men and women, ask them to watch this movie.  Then ask them what these Seals should have done to secure their mission?

I would have preferred that they sensationalized the village scene towards the end a bit less, but if you don't know the real story you probably enjoyed it plenty.

No disrespect to the men this movie is representing, but this film wasn't nearly as good as Private Ryan.

This is an enjoyable military action flick, but it's never going to win best picture.",1401235200,,325,4.491525423728813

6056313,5,B00G3D732Q,Although I heard bad reviews from a few trusted friends I watched it anyhow.  Was disappointed in only that my friends were wrong.  I enjoyed it for the entertainment value as the reality of things were based on Hollywood's interpretation.  maybe some fact checking helped garner some accuracy so have to give credit for that.,1401235200,,326,4.890909090909091

6056316,5,B00G3D732Q,"from a vet, who has served in combat zones, both in and out of uniform (albeit as a POG)--this film is outstanding.

It's a rite of passage to watch nearly every war film as a member of the armed services and this is one of the best.  I'm not going to discredit other films based on actual combat situations because this review is about this movie and the authenticity is very spot-on.  From the politics of field commanders contending for precious war assets (close air support for TIC's) to the attitudes of american soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines, to the setting where the film takes place.  I loved everything about this and it instantly took its place amongst one of my favorites of all time.

I am not a Mark Wahlberg fan by any stretch of the imagination but I thoroughly enjoyed him undertaking a humble (as opposed to central) role on-screen.  I give kudos to Mr. Wahlberg and thank him for doing an impressive job of capturing the esprit de corps that only those who have ever donned a uniform can understand.

Films like this are inspiring and really capture your reverence for true American heroes.

6056322,4,B00G3D732Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  The fighting is intense, chair arm gripping in some places.  I understand their intense devotion to one another and loyalty to their oaths.  I am a VietNam veteran and had many sad moments in my time over there and this movie brought back some deeply felt memories of my experiences.

I do feel there were at least 2 more choices they could have picked in regards to the 3 prisoners they had.  They could have plastic strapped the old man and young boy to trees and taken the young man with them as prisoner until they made radio contact and then let him go when the chopper showed up for them.  He could have then went and released them after they had made their escape.  Second choice, they could have taken all of them with them with their hands strapped behind them and gagged.  They could have let them go when rescue showed up.  Thats my opinion, only going by what I saw on the movie.  The book probably goes deeper into the problem.",1401148800,,973,4.385474860335195

6056339,5,B00G3D732Q,"I won't give any spoilers, I mean the title already tells you what to expect, rather I won't break down scenes and actor performance; the main point I would like you to take away is that this movie moved me to embarrassment more than any other emotion.  Not embarrassment for the film or acting or the killing and in your face war action, rather, embarrassment that I have ever complained or griped or stressed over small things.  These SEALS and their accompanying sister service personnel who lost their lives in this battle deserve the greatest respect ever.  This is just one battle, think of how many more there have been through this country's history.  This movie gives you a small idea of the brotherhood that is the military, and especially in the special ops forces such as SEALS.  One of the best parts of the movie is the development and explanation of their team as a brotherhood.  It also should leave you with a sense of your complete lack of the need to ever complain again or feel like you have it hard for the little stuff we take for granted each day once you've seen what their ordeal encompassed.  This movie tells a story of some heroic people who suffered again and again and simply would not give up, didn't know what that even meant.  Take a moment after watching and use their motivation and this story to give greater respect to our Active Duty and Veterans and see to it that your voice is heard to the audacious and disrespectful leadership at the civilian level in this country who can't seem to ensure that military are taken care of on all levels, from pay to perks, to whatever they want.  Especially those who have lived through battles like this.  Let this movie give you the spark to step away from the awe and worship of the pro athlete/musician/band that this country falls over themselves for, and put that respect, admiration and financial backing to the heroes and their families who have lived through, or perished in ordeals such as this.  These guys were E5 and E6 mainly, with a couple officer ranks, and you should look those up as to what they are paid for that day of hell, and ultimately the loss of their life.

 Great movie, puts you in the fight, understand their hardship throughout, and even greater window into how truly dedicated and perseverant these guys were.",1401062400,,2318,4.597087378640777

They did an amazing job of honoring the fallen. I am one who from a personal standpoint greatly appreciates this.

6056358,5,B00G3D732Q,"I have not seen a movie this well-done in a long time, if ever.  Every aspect of the film is done superbly well, from the acting to the effects, to the settings, to the camera angles, to the dialogue, to the characterization, to the pacing, and the plot.  Just perfect.  If I am not mistaken, some of the cast members were actual military!  They were fantastic.  I dare you to tell them apart from the actual career actors.

Lone Survivor is a harrowing thrill ride that will surprise you, scare you, make you cringe, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  It will also tug at your heart-strings and leave you an emotional ball of patriotism, respect (for our military), and sadness (for the great losses we have incurred).

Lone Survivor demonstrates why our troops are elite, why they are the modern day Spartans/Romans, why they are the nightmares these evil scumbags in the Middle East wake up crying about.  In this case, the scumbags are Taliban.  A LOT of Taliban.  Versus four soldiers.  Just four.

For moviegoers who prefer action films like the Avengers, if you have ever wondered if real life superheroes exist, just watch this film.  These men are the closest human beings will ever get to the fictional Captain America, Punisher, Batman, Hawkeye, Black Panther, etc.

Not only is this the most realistic and respectful presentation of our military heroes, but it also manages to humanize and honor the Middle Eastern tribes who have stood with us, helped, and shown compassion as fellow human beings.  It reminds us that there are others a world away who we should love and respect and protect.

Now, I hear the movie does not do the book justice.  I had no idea there was a book till today.  But if this is so, that book must be a masterpiece.  I am buying it:

Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson

Then it veers into straight Hollywood fiction that is not only inferior to the real story told in the book, but also trivializes the profound true story. If what happened to Marcus Luttrell after the firefight wasn't worthy enough to be faithfully executed in the movie, then nothing is. I was expecting a respectful, faithful telling of the true story, same as Black Hawk Down, which was also adapted from a book. Instead, I saw a movie that literally fabricated scene after scene. As a straight action movie, it was great. As a movie intended to pay homage to Luttrell and the other fallen S.E.A.L. team members, it is a failure.

6056375,3,B00G3D732Q,"When I first heard that they were releasing a movie of the book Lone Survivor, I was curious to see how they would put it on the screen.  First and foremost, I watch movie adaptations with a blank slate as if I have never read the book in the first place.  I love watching military movies and when it comes to the battle scenes, yes it is excellent.

The are only 2 things I did not quite get with this movie.  The first one being is Mark Wahlberg being cast as Marcus Luttrell.  If I haven't read the book, I would think Marcus Luttrell is just some other soldier who likes to curse and save his own skin when it comes down to it.  With all due respect to Mark Wahlberg, the acting was a little flat, it was all rage and no other dimension.

The second being, it was too focused on the firefight and not really on the survival part which after all was the book was about.  But hey, like I said, I pretended to have not read the book when I watched it.

Aside from that, this is the type of movie that once you start watching you have to finish.  What I would love to see is for HBO to pick this book up, put it in the hands of producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg and make a mini-series out of it.",1400803200,3,1202,4.012605042016807

From reading the book it appears that Mark Wahlberg is not my ideal choice for portraying a giant hulk of a Navy Seal, but I like Mark Wahlberg and he did a great job in portraying Luttrell as a true survivor. The other actors did a great job in their respect and honor for the lost members of Seal Team 10. The movie really showed how harrowing of a situation the members of Seal Team 10 were in. In the movie they are challenged by gray lines when confronted with making a ""moral choice"" vs ""duty choice"" which they first struggle with and don't question later. They made the right decision.

I was in the Navy at one point but my duties were not near any danger a Seal gets into. Seals go way above and beyond the call of duty. When you join the Navy, you have to further go on to volunteer to become a Seal and do some rigorous training that even the toughest of men can't withstand. My hat goes off to anyone putting themselves in this much danger to preserve our freedom.

Right from the start I was hooked and I knew this movie was going to take me on a ride that I would never forget. It was easy to understand what was going on during the scenes! My emotions during this movie were all over the place BUT I had to continue watching it until the very end. I can't seem to understand why someone would rate this movie below a 4 star?!? I'm still affected but honored by our military forces and the young men/women that dedicate their live EVERYDAY to serve our country. A reviewer said something to the effect of the story being falsified ..let's be real. Honestly, this story holds true to me and all the other soldiers that died serving so it really doesn't matter. I'm reminded by this movie that the freedom that we hold so dear was paid at a price of many fallen men/women.

We left the theater, as many others did in tears and complete silence. As much as I wanted to leave in the middle, I felt that it was disrespectful to walk out because I was too upset to see or feel what these men went through. My husband and I bonded over how emotional it was and how his experiences in Iraq changed his life. For the first time in our relationship I truly understood what it was like for him overseas and why he served our country, as well as the after effects of surviving the front lines. I believe this movie serves as a purpose to educate civilians and maybe, just maybe, after watching this mind-blowing film, people can feel what our service men and women go through.

6056401,4,B00G3D732Q,"This is a review of both the book and the movie.

I give the movie 4 stars:  It's a really good movie, but make absolutely sure you read the book also.
I give the book 5 stars:  It's an excellent book, written by the guy who was there!
I give the SEALS 6 stars:  The training and commitment of these guys is simply above and beyond.

I saw the movie, and am still haunted by the tragedy and ordeal but incredibly impressed by what these guys went through.
Knowing Hollywood almost always takes some creative license, I read the book over the next couple of days to get the whole story.
Then, I went saw the movie again.
I recommend this sequence to my friends:  See the movie for the immersive experience.  Read the book for the expanded story and additional details.  See the movie again and you'll notice a few things that probably seemed inconsequential the first time around.

To comment on some reviews questioning the number of enemy combatants (as if it really matters), I give credence to Luttrell's account in his book, and I believe the numbers were probably pretty high:
Parts of the battle seemed to be very chaotic, especially from Luttrell's perspective, and following such events, people's memories and recollections can vary wildly.  Given time to recount events and piece things together I can understand increasing estimates. eg. ""Lemme see... we shot 3 right off, there were a couple guys to the left, a few to our right, and some above us...""
Also, when you account for the amount of heavy munitions, grenades, RPG's and such that were brought to bear by the enemy, and it seems pretty obvious that it took a lot of guys to carry all that stuff up there.  And when you're climbing mountains, that stuff is heavy.
Plus, like ants and other low-life insects, there's always more Taliban lurking in the shadows than you can see.
And most importantly: because he was there.  None of us were.  I'm glad he made it.

Finally, I salute all those guys.  They were out there trying to make the world a better place, for us, and for the people of Afghanistan.  I think about them everytime I drive by the Danny Dietz Highway.  I and many others appreciate the courage and sacrifices endured by all of our military and their families.  Thank you!",1396396800,8,2255,4.595
6056402,4,B00G3D732Q,"I was interested in Lone Survivor because the film was directed by Peter Berg, director of Friday Night Lights and The Kingdom. (OK, he also made a critical and commercial flop Battleship though I didn't hate the film.) He is good at directing action scenes, and in Lone Survivor he shows what he can do with the right material.

Based on the non-fiction book written by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson, Lone Survivor follows the incredible story of four real-life Navy SEALs on a covert mission in Afghanistan Operation Red Wings that took place in 2005. Their mission is compromised in an unexpected way, and with radio communication lost, they are under attack by Taliban forces.

Lone Survivor contains visceral and gruesome combat scenes. After all this is a war movie and, considering the nature of the subject matter, the combat sequences have to be so. Using documentary-like atmospheric photography, Peter Berg tells the story of the lone survivor and what he had to go through.

Compared with the strong first half, the second half is a bit disappointing, hurried and weak on characterization. Still, with effective performances from the players, especially that of Mark Wahlberg, Lone Survivor is a memorable experience.",1396137600,7,1236,5.108910891089109

The realism of the terrain to the early Bagram scene to the SF camp to the villages and villagers was ridiculously authentic; sure Lattrell had alot to do with that. During my time as a civilian over, I worked for and lived with SEALS, Army SF, and MARSOC and those guys are a different breed, Berg and co portrayed this special group of men with precision.

6056406,3,B00G3D732Q,"As pure fiction it's not a bad movie (that's why I'm not giving it its lowest score). Of course, as with any book-to-movie I expect details kept out, due to time constraints. I can't forgive a contemporary story, which is incredibly interesting in its own right, turned into Hollywood fodder, and that's what this is.

If you have read the book, and you should, you will find the end scenes in this movie utterly unforgivable. The ""creative license"" taken with it is a huge injustice to the story and to reality.

Shameful.

Apparently reviews that don't shine praise on this piece of tripe are being dinged. So bring it on. But I find this to be an embarrassment and Americans should demand better of movies that represent real stories with real people.",1394409600,22,754,4.696969696969697
6056407,4,B00G3D732Q,"The film is based on the 2005 American operation in Afghanistan where four SEALs are dropped off near a remote Afghan village to survey a Taliban leader. The mission is compromised when the four run into three Afghan civilians. Once the Taliban hears of their presence it's four SEALs against a veritable army. Can they make it out alive?

I thought this was a solid war/survival movie. It's very realistic, except maybe for the scenes of the SEALs falling down the rocky slopes of the mountain a couple times (how could they even walk after such falls?). The first 45 minutes presents a nice build-up to the action and then it's intense throughout the most of the rest of the movie.

The final act shares something that I didn't know about this operation, which involves an Afghan village. I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to spoil it.

This is just a straight war flick based on a true story and on that level it works well. It's not American propaganda; it simply honors these  courageous men, including some Afghanis. It may lack the depth and greatness of films like Platoon, Rambo (2008) and Apocalypse Now, but it's still worth checking out.",1394323200,2,1164,4.663414634146341

above them to give us a very good movie.
Strong performances from Mark Wahlberg, Kitsch, Hirsch and Foster, and a all around compelling story of the bond between soldiers, and renewed faith in human's.

6056409,2,B00G3D732Q,"I wish I could get enthusiastic about LONE SURVIVOR.  Peter Berg's direction is both terse and non-partisan, portraying the sheer hell of Americans trying to fight in an alien territory against an elusive opponent.  Led by Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), a small group of troops are left alone to fight for their lives in an atmosphere fraught with danger; this is memorably evoked through fast cuts and the use handheld cameras emphasizing the peril that they are faced with.  The actors are excellent, especially Wahlberg and Taylor Kitsch as his fellow-soldier.  On the other hand LONE SURVIVOR is inscribed within wearyingly familiar binarist terms; the Taleban are represented as both savage and ruthless, as opposed to the more humanist American forces.  The fact that the Americans are invading another territory is conveniently overlooked.  The motive for the mission - to kill a notorious Taleban leader Ahmad Shah - is justifiable, but time and again recent history has demonstrated that the notions of ""terror"" and ""terrorism,"" as interpreted from an American perspective might represent something very different in other contexts.  Nor does the film actively question why the American forces are occupying Afghanistan; what their motives are; and what the final outcome of their campaign might be.  The focus instead is on the bravery of a few individuals rather than looking at the wider political implications of their actions.  Within these limited parameters, director Berg opts for a thick-ear approach, with the script regularly peppered with curses and/or gunshots in familiar war-film mode.",1393977600,8,1611,5.361111111111111
6056410,4,B00G3D732Q,"Capturing the essence of war has been a theatrical tradition ever since the Greeks invented drama.  In the cinematic practice, war films range from fully inspiring to gruesomely tragic.  Lone Survivor is an example of the latter.

The film tells the story of an ill-fated Navy SEAL operation named RED WINGS.  During their mission to kill Taliban officer, Ahmad Shah, a SEAL team is stranded in a hostile region of Afghanistan.  What follows is a horrific series of events as the four SEALs attempt to escape a barrage of enemy forces after they are ambushed.

The film opens with a montage of intense Navy SEAL training exercise as preparation for whats to follow.  Shots of submersion drills, endurance tests, and tactical maneuvers serve two purposes: 1) they make the audience have an initial feeling that nothing can be harder than this, and 2) they serve as a reflective point for when things become exponentially harder than this.  Writer/Director Peter Berg spent four years and a modest $40 million budget to get Marcus Luttrells memoir to the big screen.  The result is operatic realism.  Berg scales down the war film to create a film that while inherently anti-war is also a celebration of the men who possess an uncommon type of courage.

Berg is a filmmaker who has dabbled in this subject matter before with 2007s The Kingdom.  In that film, Berg showed war as a fast, swift, pulse pounding, adrenaline pumping game, almost like the football depicted in the television series Friday Night Lights, also created by Berg.  Lone Survivor is an entirely different animal.  Here Berg narrows his scope and slows things down.  This brutal battle along the Afgahni hillside is as harrowing, frightening, and vital as perhaps any of its kind.  Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hersh, and Taylor Kitsch play the band of stranded soldiers who intermittently attempt to communicate with their commanding officer, played by Eric Bana.  Bergs deliberate pace is on full display packed with slow motion evidence of the blood, guts, and horrors of war.

What the film has working against it is its outcome, which with the title Lone Survivor, should not surprise anyone.  Thus, it is clear that Berg has more on his agenda than to tell a story.  That agenda is to give tribute to those who fight to keep this country safe while also suggesting what could have been if they didn't have to.  This agenda is met, but with a melancholy spirit.  The leanness of the film and the bleak tone make it difficult to watch, yet the film is strong, well acted, and evocative.  The final scenes suggest some of the ironic complexities of modern even with the films simplistic nature.  While better films about this topic exist, Berg does a solid job delivering this particular story.  That being said, this is not a film for everybody by any stretch of the imagination; however, it is successful at depicting those naturalistic forces that are at work in the quagmire of todays combative warfare.

6056411,5,B00G3D732Q,"Let me first state that I don't write reviews for many movies. I saw this on the recommendation of a friend and being a Long Islander that knows the story of hero Michael Murphy, I was intrigued to see this film. This movie in no way felt like 2 hours. The minutes flew by as I watched these 4 incredibly brave men fight for their lives and for our country in those mountains.

I have to tip my hat to Peter Berg, who's directing was, in my opinion, flawless. From the drops off the mountains to the details of the operation, to the relationship between these 4 men, he spun a masterpiece. The acting was great as well. I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg but I have to admit this is my favorite role he's played. He worked hard to get it right and leave his often pompous attitude behind as he became Marcus Luttrell. I adored Emile Hirsh as the warrior Danny who despite being hit the most, fought until he could no more. Ben Foster perfectly captured the telling of Axe from the book and Alexander Ludwig was great as the eager, younger Patton. For me though, the true shining star of this film was Taylor Kitsch who portrayed Mike Murphy. His leadership in the battle scenes came through brilliantly while also displaying his heartfelt love he had for his teammates, and his act to give himself up selflessly to make that ill fated call. His line of ""never out of the fight"" gave me chills.

The friendship between Luttrell and the man who rescued him leads to some of the best scenes. His simple ""thank you"" was enough to make me break down (for the 3rd time since the beginning).

Another small detail worth mentioning is the beginning of this film when we see the soldiers rooms and walls. Let us never forget they were men who were loved by family and friends, who had hobbies and interests and their whole lives ahead of them. They were somebody's son or brother or friend...but more than anything they were heroes and may their sacrifices never be forgotten.

Read the book, see the movie and hopefully be like me, and realize all the little things in life we may sometimes take for granted.",1393804800,7,2099,4.444155844155844

Based on the true story of Operation Red Wings, 2005, LONE SURVIVOR is gripping, well-acted, and well-filmed. It shows in no uncertain terms what it's like to train and fight in an outfit like the Navy Seals. Lots of death and violence, but no really blatant gore.

LONE SURVIVOR is too grimly realistic to function simply as a cheesy war thriller, which is good. Still, shoot-'em-up scenes in the mountains of Afghanistan very much predominate here. That, of course, was mostly what ORW consisted of, and some will like this quality of the film while others won't. Regardless, LONE SURVIVOR would have been better if there had been more in the way of back-story/flashbacks on local Taliban leader Ahmad Shah's activities, as well as more on the specific politics of the region and the operation. More of an alternating focus on the Seals, the Taliban, and the neighboring villagers would also have been a plus.

It takes a lot of courage to go through what they did and not to want to give up. I think if I incurred the wounds that they did and was in the situation that they were in, I would have gave up.

After encountering mountain herders as they are slowly descending on the village, their location is compromised. With their radios and communication going out, they are left to fight for their lives.

Even with the extended dramatized death scenes it was still very upsetting.  I know about as much as most Americans do about what is going on over in Iraq/Iran so that would be nothing.  I was shocked to know that the whole thing happened because of crappy gear. I kept thinking how the team was equipped almost as badly as troops were in the Vietnam War.  Ironically the team was taken down by people with weapons from the 70s and 80s.  It was so upsetting.  I can think of a few things I saw at the Shot Show that would have improved their chances which made it more upsetting.  The film was shot beautifully and I'm glad they kept all the details they did, especially the ending credits.  Be prepared to cry.  I cried.

5 things that could have saved them

rock blankets.  Sleeping bag like things that have the texture and look of stone.
better cell phones or a nav stock so they could walk to the huge town of anti Taliban people.
Intel that there was a town of Anti Taliban people in walking distance.
Afgani clothing so they could bury their gear and enter the town easily and hopefully escape.
A gigantic sniper rifle like a HS .50. Shoot the target and leave the gun with a claymore and then move up.

I guess these and many other things everyone thinks up after the fact, but I still can't believe they had a crappy com devise.  They would all be alive now if someone had a better phone.  This will bother me all day.  The film was amazing though.  Great cast (wish they added in the non caucasian soldiers that were not caucasian but whatever)!

However, I've learned that in the military: the more you talk, the less you actually did. I don't want to dive into what's already been discussed elsewhere such as how many ""enemies"" there actually were and how did the ""lone survivor"" make it out alive against such odds. I did watch this movie with more than a grain of salt.

Another thing I've learned in life is that when there is telling of a story, there's also an opposite interpretation that has equal merits. The truth usually can be found somewhere in the middle.

On those notes, here are my problems with the story/movie:
-if communication was poor, the team should have retreated to the previous points (corona, miller, etc) to re-establish communication after they've gotten the reconnaissance. What's good about recon if you don't have communication? Why weren't there contigency plans for this possibility of losing communication?
-the whole scene about what to do with the goat herders is laughable, not noble. If you don't take out the individuals that may compromise the whole mission, then at least tie them up. If you're going to let them go, at least tie up the two young ones (especially the teenager) and let the old man go. It would have taken him much longer to go down the mountain to alert the enemies. Or bring them with you up the hill and farther from the compound with the intent of releasing them only after you've been extracted or after you've re-establish communication. ANYTHING except to let them run down the hill immediately after being set free!! The mission was already compromised. Now your team's welfare will be compromised too. Such lack of strategy was disturbing
-again, no contingency plans in the event that the teams run into women or children or civilians during the mission?
-when outnumbered, seek higher ground with potential escape routes. Avoid being attacked from all sides or flanked. I'm not a strategist, just one with common sense
-lastly, why did the enemies rush the SEALS as if they were Indians in old cowboy movies? They had numbers. They had higher ground. They had machine guns and RPG-7s to mow them down. Yet, they shot like Stormtroopers. Hollywood at its best.
-I could go on

Overall it was a watchable movie with good action. It was just not believable. One would have to be very naive to think that what's depicted here is a accurate ACCOUNT of what TRULY happened. There's an old study in which 100 people were shown a simple video of an actual bank robbery. When the participants of the study were asked to describe the robbery suspect in terms of height, weight, hair color, and even sex: there were many contrasting descriptions and accounts.

Of course this is just a review/critique of the movie.  It has not made me to lose any respect and gratefulness for the dedication, courage, and heroism of those who serve and protect us. Now that would be un-American!",1391472000,44,3025,4.763358778625954

Director/Writer: Peter Berg
Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, Alexander Ludwig and Eric Bana
Runtime: 2hrs Certificate: 16
Cinema Release: 31st January 2014

Based on US Navy SEAL Markus Luttrells book Lone Survivor, starring Mark Wahlberg in the lead role as Petty Officer 1st Class Markus Luttrell during the faithful mission on the Afghanistan/Pakistan border called Operation Redwing in 2005. Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious Taliban leader.

After confirming his identity and setting up an OP they were disturbed by local shepherds who they had to set free. This led to the SEALs trying to out-run an enemy force of 150+ who were in close pursuit through the mountains of Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of three members of SEAL Team 10.

Lone Survivor is a true story of how a Special Forces operator survives against outstanding odds even after suffering the deaths of his other team members, Axe (Foster), Dietz (Hirsch) and team leader and best friend Lt Mike Murphy (Kitsch).

Although the film doesn't stand up to how PO 1st Class Luttrell survived behind enemy lines injured and dehydrated for four days and the action and realities of war portrayed in the book. I do understand that film production was aimed at producing a two hour action movie, and as a standalone movie it is action packed and truly enjoyable and Im pleased that Markuss story receives a wider audience as a true warrior should.

Lone Survivor starts out by introducing us to US soldiers Marcus, Michael (often referenced as ""Mikey""), Danny, ""Axe"", Shane, and Erik. Erik is the primary leader or rather, facilitator of the operation (based on real life Operation Red Wings), and he instructs the soldiers to go on a mission to track Ahmad Shah who is our main antagonist. And so begins our adventure.

There are so many good things to say about Lone Survivor. And you who have read my reviews know I like to start with the acting; so I will say, the acting is great, like SERIOUSLY great. Pain and Gain was definitely not one of Mark Wahlberg's highlight movies, but was highly notable as Marcus in the movie. Ben Foster was on point in his role as Axe, Alexander Ludwig was actually quite the talent for his role as Shane, Emile Hirsch's character Danny was one to remember, and Taylor Kitsch courageously holds his ground extremely well as Michael. Great acting.

To close, even though Lone Survivor has 2 nominations, I am not only surprised that this movie(along with the likes of The Butler, The Spectacular Now, Fruitvale Station, etc. etc) were overlooked much to my dismay with the award shows as of recent, I am also pleasantly surprised at how great this movie is. I enjoyed it, the people in the theater(as evidenced by the multiple applauds at the end) enjoyed it and I have a feeling anyone will enjoy this movie.

6056427,5,B00G3D732Q,"The movie ""Lone Survivor"" is Peter Berg's superbly directed story of 'Operation Redwing,' a Navy Seal mission in Afghanistan gone awry. On 28 June 2005 four members of Seal Team 10 were tasked to kill or capture notorious warlord and Hekmayter associate Ahmad Shah in mountainous Kunar Province. Based on HM-1 Marcus Lutrell's (the mission's lone survivor) New York Times 2007 bestseller, ""Lone Survivor"" tells the incredible true story of four Navy SEALs on a covert mission that is compromised by their discovery by four Afghan civilians.

Faced with a difficult moral decision whether or not to kill the four locals who were sure to reveal their presence to the Taliban, the Seals are cut off from rescue as they are surrounded by a much larger force of combat-experienced Taliban. As together they attempt to fight their way to safety, each Seal is forced to tap unknown reserves of strength and resilience as they fight until the end. Combat is loud, messy, and confusing, so Berg has chosen to focus on the four Americans, and presents their story as straightforwardly as possible.

The movie is accurate; the lone survivor, former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell, served as an advisor to Berg and the cast. Technically it's first rate; 'Lone Survivor' has already been nominated for best movie, best action movie, and best actor (Wahlberg).

The point of producing 'Lone Survivor' is to give the American public a window to understand the warrior ethos and shared sacrifice. Coming face-to-face with some Afghan goat herders, the Seals made the hard choice to release them unharmed, despite knowing the locals would quickly inform the Taliban of their presence. Having made the difficult but ethical choice not to kill unarmed civilians, the Seals are soon attacked by an overwhelming Taliban force. Facing fearsome odds made worse by the Taliban having the high ground, the surviving Seals were forced to strip the body of each Seal killed for ammunition and weapons. Knowing they were trapped, Lt Michael Murphy, exposed himself to heavy fire in order to radio his headquarters for a rescue. Murphy is killed (and in 2007 posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor)

The chair-bound reviewers who rarely break a sweat (and wouldn't last a week in boot camp) will never understand a movie such as ""Lone Survivor;' while they look down at the 'carnage of combat', claim it has 'too much violence', 'doesn't include women,' or 'is a jingoistic snuff film', these moral lightweights have forgotten that America sent troops into Afghanistan in retaliation for 9/11. Berg is at his best in producing movies that show individuals under extreme stress (Friday Night Lights, Lone Survivor) and how they respond under pressure; 'Lone Survivor' is a tribute to all those Marines-Sailors-Soldiers-Airmen who volunteer to serve America by going in harms way.",1390780800,9,2845,5.098712446351931

First and foremost, this is one intense war movie, and most definitely not one for the faint of heart. I had to look away on a number of occasions simply because I couldn't bear it at that particular moment. Second, the movie as depicted here takes an artistic license and differs on a number of points from what REALLY took place (for example: Luttrell never went into cardiac arrest; the Taliban never attacked the local village in retribution for helping Luttrell, etc.). Third, I realize that the movie is based on Luttrell's memoir which is titled ""Lone Survivor: but why oh why would you title the movie by giving away the final outcome? Fourth, there is an outstanding soundtrack featured in the movie, from the indie-band Explosions In the Sky. I've had the good fortune of seeing these guys on a number of occasions, including at Coachella and Lollapalooza. Check them out live if you get the chance, you will be amazed. Last but certainly not least, in 2013 a documentary called ""Murph the Protector"" was released (now available here on Amazon), detailing the life of Michael Murphy, one of the 4 Navy SEALS who are the subject of ""Lone Survivor"". I happen to think that ""Lone Survivor"" is a much better tribute to Murph (and all of the other servicemen taking part in Operation Red Wings), but you may want to see for yourself and draw your own conclusion.

This movie has now been playing in theaters for a month now, yet when I went to see it last night (a Friday evening), the theater was absolutely PACKED. This movie truly has resonated with audiences in a major way. Not only is the movie itself outstanding, but you add to that the apparent still unmet desire of large segments of the American public to better understand what all took place during the war in Afghanistan (and Iraq) and the true heroism from service men like Luttrell, Murphy and others, and you have a major box office success on your hands, and rightly so. Bottom line: ""Lone Survivor"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1390608000,5,2138,4.729222520107238

Oh, it's very understandable without the book first, but the film is made because so many haven't read the book first, with excitement and action/violence in mind. Several scenes differ from the book. It is a war movie...all mountains/pines, little desert. Shows that war is hell, as if you didn't know!

I prefer to hang onto the visions I created in my mind as I read. If you wish to see the movie, fine. It's very good.

I've seen this film more than once because it is reminder to me of what made America great to have such men of honor defending it!  It makes me very proud and thankful to God to have been a member of the United States Navy in time of war (1968-72), and especially thankful for those men and their families, God bless and keep them all!

On April 23, 2009, as a member of the research faculty, I attended a dedication ceremony at Pond Laboratory, Penn State, in memory of Lt. Michael P. Murphy, USN SEAL, who gave the last full measure of devotion for his country in Afghanistan in 2005.  The Pond Laboratory at Penn State now has The Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy Memorial Conference Room.  Lt. Murphy graduated with honors at Penn State with degrees in political science and psychology.

The incredible account of Lt. Murphy's heroism along with his fellow SEALS is portrayed magnificently in Lone Survivor per the reports of that battle that I've seen.  The highlight of the day for me at Penn State was being able to talk with Lt. Murphy's parents  at the end of the ceremony, letting them know that, as a Vietnam War Navy veteran, ""I had to be here today for your son and his family,"" which I'm sure are shared sentiments with military veterans around the country who, if they could not be at the dedication ceremony physically, were there spiritually out of respect for a true hero in a team of heroes in the highest tradition of the Naval service.

God bless and keep you and your family, and all in our Armed Forces in harms way, always, Lt. Murphy.

Instead, it became a typical Hollywood action flick completed with a ""rescue mission"" involving a battle between US Special Forces and the Taliban, which did not exist.

6056439,4,B00G3D732Q,"Peter Berg, for my dollar, is a gifted director. I like the way he handles his subject matters and, though maybe he doesn't dig too deep, he does what he does with a deft hand.

Here's the scoop. A four man Navy Seal team is sent to a village in the mountains of Afghanistan to kill or capture heavyweight al Qeada leader Ahmad Shahd. One tiny, unforeseen thing happens that sends the entire operation hurtling into hell.

I didn't read the book, which is considered by some to be more than a bit improbable, so I can't answer to the accuracy of it all. But say it was all made up out of whole cloth. It's still a heck of a military action film. You meet the primary players and get their sense of comradery. These are cool guys. They are the elite so they they don't have the strict military appearance. Their hair is long. Many sport beards and they do a lot of hanging out. But the call comes in and they're ready. When the doo-doo hits the fan things get real intense and some of the problems arise by the terrain wrecking havoc with their communications. But they work with what they have and kill a lot of the enemy. The kill ratio is way uneven but here you have some highly trained guys with state of the art bang bang going up against lesser trained guys with lesser quality bang bang so it's not too tough to believe. The final 15 or 20 minutes got too Hollywood for my sensibilities. I mean, the cavalry doesn't always show up in the nick of time. I could have done without that but this is still one wild ride up to that point.

I liked Berg's ""The Kingdom."" Some complained that this great cultural clash degenerated into an out and out action flick. They wold be right,but that seems to be where Berg is at his best. I'm guessing we'll see a lot more of him in the future. If you like flicks like ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""When We Were Soldiers"" you'll like this easily as much.",1389830400,8,1888,4.2534818941504176

6056444,3,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor is about Operation Red wings.  It was a Navy Seal operation conducted to take out a Taliban commander named Ahmad Shah.  The operation was a complete failure.  It wound of costing the lives of every person involved aside from one person.  His name is Marcus Luttrell.  I guess that makes the title a spoiler.

There are spoilers ahead in my review, so don't read further if that bothers you.  I will say that it will probably not affect your viewing experience.

From an entertainment standpoint, I think this film delivers.  Unfortunately, if you want something deeper than the average run of the mill military experience, this film falls flat.  Peter Berg could have made this film into something greater, but he made a product which is more about telling a story rather than taking on serious issues and creating debate.

The big issue I had is that the film does not take on the fact that America has not learned its lessons when it comes to the country of Afghanistan.  There was an Afghani man, Mohammad Gulab, who put his family's life on the line by saving Marcus from the Taliban.  What thanks does he get from the Americans at the end of the film?  They take Marcus away to their base and abandon the man and his family at the battle zone to defend himself against the Taliban.  The Taliban knew he harbored and aided an American, so his and his loved one's lives were in danger.  The military did not care.

I guess history repeats itself.  After the Soviet Union retreated many years earlier, America abandoned its ally and moved on.  A vast uneducated and young population was left alone.  They struggled and fought with each other as the country fell into chaos.

Fast forward to Operation Red Wings and the same thing happens again.  A guy who put his life on the line for you is left to fend for himself.  What if the Aghanis heard that story?  I would think it would not win their hearts and minds, but it would lead them to believe that they should support the Taliban.  The US may leave one day, but they will be stuck having to deal with their own people after they depart.  I think that is why it is very hard for the American military to win their trust now.

This brings me to my next point.  Mohammad Gulab, follows a tribal code known as pushtunwali.  When he brings Marcus to his village, it is his duty to protect him from his enemies and not let him die at their hands.  I know in the American media it is always shown that Afghan tribalism is a backward way of life, but, maybe, this movie could have changed that one-sided view.

For me it shows that tribalism is not all about oppressing women, but it has some positive aspects to it as well.  The fact that someone was willing to put their life on the line for a foreigner serving in an opposing military proves that this code is very strictly followed.  Is honor that strong of a trait in the American way of life?  I think that is a very interesting subject to debate.  At the very least, it proves that life is not as simplistic in Afghanistan as it is made out to be by the media.

Finally, Ahmed Shah is called ""a real bad guy"" in the film when he is first introduced in the film.  Is he?  Keep in mind, he is not a member of Al Quaida, the group run by Osama Bin Laden, who attacked us during 9/11.  He is a member of the Taliban, who are mainly members of the Pushtun tribe.  They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.

In the film, he is portrayed as a target.  He does not have any pertinent dialogue to the film.  What if, instead of the usual portrayal of a bad guy, they make him more complex?  He could have been portrayed as a guy who is trying to get an occupying army out of his country.  Well, of course no one will ever do that.  That just too hard to accomplish.  Hollywood is about having clear cut good and bad guys.

I guess the good thing for me is that the movie has propelled me to order the book authored by Marcus Luttrell.  If it's one thing I've learned about Hollywood, it is the fact that the book is, usually, better and more detailed and complex than the film.",1389657600,12,4096,4.326315789473684

6056446,4,B00G3D732Q,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Director and co-writer Peter Berg has brought to life the story of a failed Afghanistan mission known as Operation Red Wings conducted by SEAL Team 10.  It was the subject based on a book written by the lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell.  (Note, the title gives away any spoiler conclusions.)  While many threads about the men are touched upon throughout the film, it is mostly an action thriller and it works agonizingly well in that regard.

The mission was to drop a squad of 4 men into the rugged mountains of the country in order to locate a notorious Taliban leader.  A helicopter assault would follow.  The squad was led by Lt. Michael Murphy (Berg regular Taylor Kitsch) along with Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg), Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch) and Matt `Axe' Axelson (Ben Foster), all of whom are nearly unrecognizable behind the dirt, grime and facial hair.

While they spotted the location of Shahd (Yousuf Azami), they were also discovered by a herd of goats, tended by an old man, a teenage boy and a kid of about 10.  This key development in the story involves what to do with the 3 locals which if freed would likely jeopardize the mission and perhaps their own lives.  Two of the men wanted to kill them and proceed, one was concerned about military rules and regulations and potential prosecution if they killed the civilians.  Unable to reach headquarters, the decision is made by Murphy to free them, head for higher ground, abort the mission and call for extraction.  Unfortunately, the mountain had other ideas and sure enough the teen headed straight for the Taliban who then went after the Americans.  What follows is a harrowing battle.

Well outnumbered, the men are eventually thrown off a cliff by mortar explosion.  In a remarkable scene they fall down the steep mountainside which is filled with small trees and large rocks and boulders.  It would be interesting to see the medical report for the actors and stunt men who executed these falls.  It is gut wrenching to watch.

While this is a first rate action film coming in at 2 hours, there is little depth given to the character's themselves other than their skill, toughness and tactical abilities.  The training component of the SEALs in general is provided under the opening credits with actual footage of some of the endurance and psychological methods used by the Navy.  The events surrounding Luttrell's eventual rescue are well done but not much is revealed about his surprising relationship with a new friend.  The film is beautifully shot, with New Mexico standing in for Afghanistan.  I will also commend Berg for bringing in another regular from the ""Friday Night Lights"" TV series.  ""Explosions in the Sky"" provide the haunting guitar based soundtrack.  Keep hankies ready as the film concludes with a photo array of those that died in the mission including those on a transport helicopter attempting a rescue.  Excellent film.",1389571200,11,2952,4.901209677419355
6056447,5,B00G3D732Q,"I have always been a fan of director Peter Berg. His movies haven't always been well reviewed or even movies that I liked, but one thing that Berg always puts first, places him as a rare breed in Hollywood these days; he digs deep into the characters personalities and he lets them tell the story instead of the visuals. Lone Survivor may just be his shining achievement to date for that very reason.

The movie is based on a real Seal Team 10 failed mission called Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan, 2005. In order to tell the story accurately, Berg had the lone survivor, SO1 Marcus Luttrell move into his home for a month, as well as visiting the deceased families in order to truly understand them. It is that devotion to accuracy and responsibility that earns, to me, a massive level of respect for Peter Berg as a director and earns what may be his best movie to date.

Lone Survivor is not only a testament to Berg, it is a testament to the Navy Seal heroes that push their bodies to excruciating places in order to rise above their enemies and their conditions. It is the kind of movie that I have only experience once before with Saving Private Ryan. When its over you could hear a pin drop in the mostly packed theater. You stick around during the credits out of respect for the men and boys that lost their lives during the operation.

The book Lone Survivor depicts the enlistment and training of Luttrell. That portion of the book is adequately portrayed with real archive training footage, showing how they are pushed to the inch of death to prepare themselves for the worst. This footage is a perfect precursor to what is to come as the four men endure a grueling 4-hour dogfight with an overwhelming number of Taliban fighters in a rugged and mountainous area. The events are captured with stunning realism. Some of which, Im not even sure how they pulled off so convincingly.

Lone Survivor is an important movie in all aspects. It isn't an anti-war movie or a pro-war movie. It is what it is; reality. It is filmed and told with great accuracy and in doing so, it is treated with the ultimate fairness. Understand why soldiers do what they do, understand the enemy we fight and understand that all Muslims aren't the problem. When it is all said and done, the movie is impossible to take your eyes off. As relentless as the movie is, it is only a movie compared to what the real Seals went through on that mountain.",1389571200,8,2434,4.512471655328798

6056450,5,B00G3D732Q,"This is hands down the most intense, graphic, gripping and riveting war film I have ever seen, bar none.  Start to finish it does not let up, and as a viewer you are carried along on this wild roller coaster ride as you immerse yourself into the real life series of events that this film depicts.  The theater was packed with both men and women, which was interesting to note.

What these soldiers went through to succeed in Seal training was astounding (almost beyond what most of us could ever imagine being able to do) and their bond to each other was simply amazing but also the necessity that kept them going.  What happened to these guys physically was beyond incredible (for me the most intense was several instances of having to escape by jumping off literal cliffs and bouncing down long rocky slopes, truly painfully hard to watch, and how on earth did they not end up with their bodies entirely broken in a million pieces?) , yet they kept going despite what seemed like impossible odds for a very long time.  Knowing from the outset that only Luttrell would survive did not detract from the story, but it made things so much more poignant as you watch events unfold as people were lost.

I was very glad to see that the evil viciousness and utter cruelty of the Taliban was clearly depticted through not only their treatment of Americans they captured but also their eagerness to mow down their own fellow Afghans who do not agree with them.  I was also glad to see a clear portrayal of good and compassionate Afghan people who made it clear they did not support the Taliban (one man emphatically stating ""Taliban nistam, I am not a Taliban), and who risked their own lives to save Luttrell.  Overall, I did not see this film as a political commentary on the war either pro or con (although there were a few small things that clearly revealed the political frustrations our military has to operate under in trying to do their jobs), but before long I felt this film had boiled down to the Seal team's most basic will to survive under the most seemingly impossible odds in this war, this battle.

As a woman, I have to say I strongly responded to this film despite how hard it was to watch and experience, but I'm not sure I could watch it a second time due to its emotional intensity.  It left me with such profound respect and increased admiration for our soliders and for these Seals in particular.  I would put this film into a category of ""everyone needs to see this.""  Most people have no idea what war can really be like at its worst, and why any war entered into must be done with clear purpose and resolve to finish and achieve our goals going into it.  No namby pamby politicians doing the back seat directing of war, please.  All this said, I did leave the film wondering why we keep going into wars (Vietnam going forward) but don't allow ourselves to fully do what it takes to achieve our goals.  Politics always meddles too much, and I feel angry about that.  Do the job right and then go home.

Deeply gratifying was a long segment at the end of the film which showed multiple photos and some video clips of all the real Seals who died in this incident, giving them a much needed and well deserved face and honor that should never be forgotten by any of us.  It was important to be able to put a real face to the names in the film.  Real people who led real lives and who died terrible deaths, and who should be honored and remembered.  The emotion of this film will make you cry (or want to), and this was a film in which the appreciative audience clapped somberly but with respect at the end.

Finally, kudos are due to Mark Wahlberg, who did such an incredible job both in his portrayal of Luttrell and in his role as producer.  He did great honor to the Seals in his telling of this important story.  I hope he gets the recognition he deserves for this film.

6056452,3,B00G3D732Q,"""Lone Survivor"" is a brutal, graphic, combat movie. It depicts US Navy SEALs fighting against Taliban in Afghanistan in 2007. It is based on Marcus Luttrell's book of the same title. There is very little plot. The movie opens with scenes of Navy SEALs undergoing rigorous training. Trainees are shown lying down under oncoming ocean waves, being dunked in water so that they cannot breathe, doing pushups, etc.

After this brief segment, the film sets up each SEAL team member. They are shown to be lovable guys who have families back home whom they cherish and who cherish them. One SEAL wants to buy his fiance an Arabian horse. Another is concerned about his wife's redecorating in a color called ""honeydew."" Given Marcus Luttrell's fame and the title of the movie, most people will know how this movie ends. That knowledge gives these scenes that much more poignancy, but also a sense of the director manipulating the audience. We know what's coming, and we know why the director included these scenes.

The SEALs are assigned to assassinate Taliban commander Ahmad Shah. They are shown with all their gear, penetrating a steep mountain covered with pines and strewn with boulders. They see their target, and are ready to carry out their mission. They are discovered by three Afghan goat herders. They consider killing the goat herders, but Luttrell advises against it. If they kill the goat herders, they will be condemned on CNN as bestial Americans who assassinate Afghan civilians. Immediately after the soldiers release the goat herders, the goat herders inform the Taliban of their location. They Taliban quickly surround, outnumber, and begin firing on the four SEALs.

The firefight is depicted in graphic, brutal, realistic images. A SEAL is shown aiming his weapon, firing, and a Taliban's turbaned head explodes into a squirting fountain of red liquid. Bullets penetrate flesh and blood and gore ooze out. This gunfight is lengthy and tense. I have to ask how it will affect viewers. Will viewers want to get a gun and make someone's head explode? Yes, our media is saturated with violence. Is that a good thing? Have we given up even asking this question?

The film never addresses the larger questions at play, and by not addressing them, they become all the louder. What are we doing in Afghanistan? How do we win in Afghanistan? Are we wasting the lives of fine, patriotic Americans and other allied men and women in uniform? Not to mention the polio workers, doctors and other aid workers the Taliban murders in Afghanistan?

How about the rules of engagement? If we are at war in Afghanistan, then why aren't we acting as if we are at war? Should the goat herders not have been immediately killed, thus possibly saving many soldiers' lives and leading to a successful mission  the death or capture of Ahmad Shah? If soldiers are forced to conduct a war while wearing kid gloves, how can they be expected to win? What if we had imposed these rules of engagement on our soldiers during WW II? Would they have been able to win that war? Would the swastika not still be flying in Europe as we engaged in endless talks with our ""partners for peace""?

Again, none of this is discussed in the film, making the discussion all the louder inside the viewer's head. In fact there was some controversy when CNN's Jake Tapper asked Marcus Luttrell about the ""Senseless"" deaths depicted in the film. Marcus Luttrell asserted that no, the deaths depicted in the film were not senseless. Americans are asking this, though. What are we doing in Afghanistan?",1389484800,4,3561,4.847039473684211

Having read the book, and seeing the behind the scenes of the making of the film on HBO, I was super hyped to see this movie. Especially because it was a true account, and the Texas bred SEAL survivor was a HUGE part of the authenticity of the film. (And he was in a few scenes.)

This was was totally gripping. It will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly - think.

Please folks, pay your ticket stub for these lost heroes who more than deserve it. And show lone survivor Marcus Luttrell that you support his and his comrade's sacrifice to not only our country, but to those poor people in Afghanistan.",1389312000,6,826,4.35064935064935
6056454,5,B00G3D732Q,"I read the book, Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell not once but twice before seeing the movie which just came out today in my area. This incredible film stays pretty much true to what was written in the book about a military mission which involved U.S. Navy SEALs and other members of the service in Afghanistan.  Marcus Luttrell and three other Navy SEALs were on a mission to hunt a Talban leader when things went terribly wrong after releasing three goat herders who walked into their location.

In a short while the four SEALs were being hunted by an army of Taliban fighters.  The courage, bravery and loyalty displayed by these four men really tugs at the heart.  In this mission there were many other soldiers and SEALs killed when their helicopter was hit by a missile.  If you have not read the book you might be surprised at the brutality and violence of the scenes.  In this respect it was a very realistic war film.

  Marcus Luttrell was the only survivor of the four man Navy SEAL team and he dedicates his book and the movie to honor his fellow  brother SEALs who died on that mission.  This is a movie about the brotherhood of warriors who always look out for each other in battle.  Mark Wahlberg does a great job of playing Marcus Luttrell in this movie and the other actors are also wonderful.  Marcus is seen in a short cameo shot scene in the beginning of the film when a group of SEALs are sitting around a table.  If you want to see what true honor and courage looks like in battle, this is a movie you will want to see.

6056456,4,B00G3D732Q,"This movie was very well done. Everyone behind the production did a fantastic job. The writing was believable, the action scenes were intense, and the story memorable. From my reading, most of what we see on screen is believable. Sure, there are some big differences on HOW it happened, but WHAT happened is pretty straight forward. Much of what seemed politically preachy in the book has been removed from the movie. Some may call this movie propaganda due to changing some of the causes, but really, what do you expect? Its a film made for audiencesit is what it is, and its enjoyable in that format.

I really liked being brought into the individual lives at the beginning of the movie. We get to see what each soldier is like, what their attachments are back home, and their teamwork. Knowing a little about each person made the gunfire scenes all the more real and scary.

Having previously been in the military myself, I appreciate the trueness of this film much more than last years ZERO DARK THIRTY. Most of the training and situational responses are very realistic and authentic. The movie is gripping from start until finish.

Besides the aforementioned introduction into lives of these men, I also appreciated seeing actual clips of SEAL training. The blend of real and movie worked really well to set the stage.",1389225600,13,1323,4.793859649122807

I've just about finished up my 20 in the military, so there are some things I understand, but I am not Special Forces, nor a Soldier, nor a Marine, so I'm not going to get into specifics because who am I to criticize the people on the bloody end of things.

As far as the Hollywood spin/style of the event, I'll need to read the book first to be able to have a better sense of how badly they flubbed it.

Regardless, after watching this movie it left me with almost no sense of tragedy or pride.  It left me infuriated.",1389139200,10,594,4.094827586206897
6056458,1,B00G3D732Q,"Lone Survivor, the movie, is based on a (supposedly) true story. The source of that story is the book with the same title by Marcus Luttrell, who was indeed the sole survivor of a four-man SEAL team in the mountains of Afghanistan. Endorsing this movie requires ignoring basic military protocols, suspending the laws of physics, and disregarding the capabilities of the human body. The Devil, as always, is in the details.

Love of country and reverence for its armed forces runs deep in the United States. This is as it should be, and is unsurprising. We want to believe in the honor, strength and heroism of our men in battle. It is, therefore, relatively easy for a film maker to successfully appeal to our emotions. For example, in the case of this movie, the Director Peter Berg makes it very painful for the viewer to watch as our men are cut down and fighting till the end; the viewer is also inspired. The emotions squeezed from the audience makes almost irrelevant the actor's craft. Instead, we are preoccupied with the images of our bloodied countrymen fighting for their lives.

This movie further muddies the water about the catastrophe that the SEALs brought down on themselves. Now we have to contend with the movie, the book, and military reality. Most of us will have a grossly distorted view of that reality by way of Schwartzenegger-like movies, or this one, Lone Survivor.

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**

In some ways, this movie improves on realism when compared to Mr. Luttrell's book of fantasies. The Director seems to have found Mr. Luttrell's imaginings too hard to accept. For example:

1. MOVIE: When the Afghan goatherders are taken prisoner, the commanding officer (Lt. Murphy) decisively orders that the prisoners not be killed in cold blood, and sets them free.

Mr. Luttrell says in his book that there was a vote taken on whether to kill the prisoners, and the author plays a starring role--as he does throughout his book--in the final vote to release them.

2. MOVIE: The Lt. Murphy character recognizes that their mission has been compromised and so orders his team to move to higher ground and seek extraction ASAP.

Mr. Luttrell says in his book that his team merely moved a few hundred meters, and continued the mission.

3. MOVIE: Jumping over cliffs was kept to a minimum--two, I think.

Mr. Luttrell describes, in his book, jumping over cliffs and down slopes 6, 7, 8, 9 times or more, with nary a broken bone, and an unsecured weapon close at hand.

Unfortunately, the Director chose to accept Mr. Luttrell's wild (and unsupported) claim of 200 enemy soldiers poised to engage the SEALs. In the movie, the SEAL team actually see 200 armed enemy in the village. Mr. Luttrell, in his book, sees 80-100 enemy directly above his position--and notes each enemy soldier's armament; he later just assumes the estimate of 200 in all. Mr. Luttrell has remarkable observational abilities.

The number of enemy is vastly reduced in the SEALs' own commendations. Furthermore, other very respected sources give the number of enemy as 8-10. The SEALs placed themselves in a textbook, tactically worst-case position. A single enemy rifleman could have been fatal to one or more members of that SEAL team.

The Afghans in this movie are shown as ambulatory targets, without a hint of soldierly virtue. They know nothing of cover, or how to aim a weapon. Yet, they discovered the precise location of the SEALs, maneuvered on them, and caught them flat-footed.

In both the sanitized version (the movie), and much more so, in Mr. Luttrell's book, the SEALs' incompetence and disregard for basic military principles is manifest. War is unforgiving, and the SEALs paid the logical price. We should not forget, too, that their failures cost the lives of 16 other American servicemen. Had Lt. Murphy survived, rather than Mr. Luttrell, he should have been court-martialed.",1389139200,37,3885,4.920489296636085
6056459,5,B00G3D732Q,"I believe this movie will be placed on many people's lists of the best war movies.  It has the feel of being a realistic homage to the incredible men we send on the toughest missions imaginable.  Of course, this mission turned out to be TOO tough, even for the best of the best.  I'm not giving anything away, even if you haven't read the book, since the outcome is predicted by the title. The latest in combat film technique and technology is used to make for a very real feeling experience. The film does follow many war movie conventions to humanize and get to know the heroes, but doesn't come across as too sentimental in my opinion.  The movie also honors the unsung heroes who were directly responsible for saving Mr. Lutrell's life: the Afghanis who hate the Taliban and in this case put their lives on the line to help an American.

This movie doesn't feel political, but did make me think about the sacrifices every day by our country and the individuals involved in a place where those sacrifices can appear futile.  When the US and NATO leave, I hope there are enough good people willing to stand against the forces of evil so rampant in their country.",1389052800,6,1164,4.519047619047619
6056460,4,B00G3D732Q,"There is nothing like a tear jerking war film the whole f@#$%^& family can enjoy. The film opens with a montage of Navy Seal training to demonstrate that this is an elite group. It moves quickly to a base in Afghanistan where they demonstrate the adolescent machismo and crudeness that exists within the U.S. military service, highlighted by the ""poem"" recited by the new guy. We also get to see other aspects of their character, their plans for the future.

It isn't long before they go on a recon mission that doesn't go well, and plot spoiler, there is just a Lone Survivor (the guy they paid the most to be in the film). The film highlights the dilemma faced in the field by military personnel in modern times, that is how to deal with civilians of unknown allegiance. If you kill them you wind up on CNN and do 20 years (message: an open liberal media kills soldiers and saves the evil doers) or if you don't kill them, they will eventually kill you. Sometimes there are no right answers except when ""The use of deadly force is authorized"" as it was in this case. Perhaps they just said that line for effect, I don't know, but to me that would make decision making easy, especially with 20-20 hindsight.

The film has plenty of blood squirts. The injured soldiers had cuts and bruises on them which seemed to appear by magic for effect, especially cuts on the top of the face. The end credits show still photos of the actual men involved in this incident with an appropriate soundtrack to make for a teary eyed moment. I think absolute silence at the end while showing the pictures may have been more effective, if not appropriate.

I liked the realism of the film, showing the horrors of war and the impossible situations in which we place our troops. Clearly a training course in Farsi (or Dari) would have helped. I will mention the use of predator drones takes those difficult life and death decisions out of the field and places it on ""the deciders"" who can currently kill innocent people without consequence. This is a good thing for the foot soldiers (or Seals in this case) but speaks volumes of debate about the state of humanity, international law, etc. etc.

A war film worthy for patriots.

6056461,4,B00G3D732Q,"Director Peter Berg, whose most notable achievements include creating the popular 2006 NBC television show, Friday Night Lights (and also the 2004 feature film), and directing feature films, such as The Rundown, The Kingdom, and Battleship, returns with his newest endeavor, Lone Survivor.

Based on a true story and on the non-fiction book of the same name by Marcus Luttrell, Lone Survivor depicts the events that took place during Operation Red Wings in July 2005.  Mark Wahlberg stars as SO2 (Special Warfare Officer, Second Class) Marcus Luttrell, Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy, Emile Hirsch as SO2 Danny Dietz, and Ben Foster as SO2 Matthew Axelson.

The opening scene of the film gives away quite a bit about who lives and who dies during the mission of SEAL Team 10 in Afghanistan (assuming you don't already know from all the news reports).  After brief dialogue from Mark Wahlberg, one by one these characters are introduced, focusing more so on Kitschs Lt. Murphy, who is discussing a wedding present for his wife once he returns home.  He then faces off against his fellow seal in a running contest around the base  quickly established the band of brothers mentality on their base.

It doesnt take long for Eric Banas character, LCDR (Lieutenant commander) Erik S. Kristensen to approach the team about a mission.  The mission is to stakeout a village with the intent to either kill or capture an ally to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.  The four SEALS safely arrive to their destination and begin their stakeout, but are quickly thrown for a loop when they are discovered by a group of civilian shepherds.  Unwilling to detain them or kill them, the SEALS left them go  knowing full well they would instantly alert the army in the village.

The SEALS move into retreat mode and attempt to get to higher ground in order to call for extract.  However, their communications devices do not cooperate and they are quickly surrounded and pinned down by several armed members of the Taliban.  Without any help in sight and unable to call for help, its up to four SEALS to fight off showers of gunfire and survive their dire conflict.

Please keep in mind that because the events of Operation Red Wings were all over the news just a few years ago, its hard to consider anything that happens in this film to be a spoiler.  For those that are unaware, it was a battle that caused the most U.S. casualties since World War II, so anyone thinking this movie is bound for a happy ending is sadly mistaken.  Like the events of September 11, 2001, or the battle of Pearl Harbor, this historical event is difficult to watch at times, knowing full well the tragedy that lies in waiting before all is said and done.  In the event you don't recall anything about this mission, feel free to keep it that way until youve seen the movie  then do your own research if you so desire.

On the entertainment side of things, Lone Survivor will keep your heart racing to the part that you might just feel far too uncomfortable to sit still.  Even though the character development is a bit vague and rushed, its not hard to become emotionally attached to these onscreen personalities.  Mark Wahlberg, love him or hate, is the main character  even though hes not the leader.  Still, Wahlberg is at the heart of this team and his characters bond with fellow SEAL Murphy  portrayed by Peter Bergs fellow Friday Night Lights alumni, Taylor Kitsch, is a treat to watch.  Its a shame there was so much going on that these two didn't have more time to fully delve into their characters.  And, after Kitsch has really failed to establish himself as a leading man (see Battleship and John Carter), he really thrives in the supporting role  not to mention as the ranking officer calling the shots for this squad.

Outcome aside, the visuals really sell this film as a borderline jungle warfare type of engagement.  The forested area, along with the rocks and cliffs play a significant role in the films endgame  in which the Taliban clearly had the advantage, plus the numbers.  In any event, there is plenty of action and suspense to keep this film chugging along for its duration.  At times, the shootout scenes are nearly reminiscent to a video game sequence since the SEALS are easily able to pick-off quite a few bad guys before literally finding themselves between a rock and a hard place.

Obviously, in a film like this, there are plenty of spots that needed to be filled with dialogue, and naturally, Peter Berg (who also wrote the screenplay) does an amicable job of adding a few light-hearted moments incorporate some unexpected irony to their predicament.  He chooses to show these men putting up the fight of a lifetime (even sarcastically at times), refusing to submit no matter how dire their situation appears to be, and above all else, properly depicting how they stick together.  Its clear these soldiers didn't know the meaning of the word quit and thats the most admirable aspect of being a hero.  To that end, this film is a sensational success and worthy of praise.

Overall, Lone Survivor is a wonderful, realistic tribute to the courageous men that were lost in Operation Red Wings.  While I can appreciate a film of this nature, it doesnt make it any easier to watch, especially if you know the outcome.  Like other war films, including Black Hawk Down or Saving Private Ryan, Lone Survivor does an excellent job of staying on point and not losing itself as poor films, like Pearl Harbor, have in the past.  Also, like historical films have the tendency to do, time constrains force the story to wrap-up in a timely manner.  For instance, the shootout in this film reportedly lasted roughly 4 hours, but is quickly accelerated to save time.  Regardless, by the time you reach the climax in this film, your heart will be heavy, you head will be hung, and youll almost wish you didn't have to witness what you just saw.  With that being said, this is a hard movie to recommend, not because its not well done, but because its simply difficult to witness.

6056462,5,B00G3D732Q,"When I first saw the trailers for this film I had high hopes. I had hopes of a military type movie that would deliver the action where it is needed with gun fights, strategy, and awesome machinery (AC-130 and other aerial vehicle use). Then I realized this was based on a true story, so Hollywood effects would be and should be sugar-coated a bit. And what did I get? Above and Beyond expectation.

Brief synopsis: A Team of 4 Seal members are sent on a special covert mission to capture or kill an enemy Taliban leader when the operation is compromised. What happens next is a battle for their lives and survival for each brother.

First off I want to say ALL the actors delivered! I was lucky enough to catch the movie with pretty good DVD quality (I'm a Blu-Ray man). Wahlberg nailed his role as well as the other actors portraying their characters. Second this movie is gory, dramatic, and you will clench your chest in surprise and amazement at some of the action sequences. The director got it spot on and made sure the viewer would see and understand what these soldiers go through. I always had the respect for SEALS but after watching this movie, I have a deeper bond with that respect. And third, this is NOT a military campaign ad! This kind of job is not cut out for everybody. Instead it made you comprehend the bond these men share and what it means to be a part of an elite team.

I gave it a 4.8 because this film touched me on so many emotional levels and when it was over I had a tear in my eye. That other .2 was due to the fact that FINAL gun fight I expected a little more but like I said it was and correctly sugar coated to emphasize the fact that it was Based on True Events.",1388707200,18,1699,4.253869969040248

6056464,5,B00G3D732Q,"I was one of the lucky ones that got to see an early preview of this movie.  Thank you Seal of Honor FB page for the link for the tickets.

Let me start off by saying I was very familiar with this story before I saw the movie having read Lone Survivor book as well as the book by Sofrep on the rescue of Marcus Luttrell.  I have read all of the books on Murph.  I am so glad this movie was made, so more people can know the sacrifice made by our military and their families.

Let me give you a little background on the premiere I was at - it was packed, people were trying to sneak sit in aisles because every seat in the theater was taken.  I was lucky enough to have a group of 7 jack wagons behind me that were very vocal - always a bonus right?  They had a comment about most of the people in the theater and especially the girls.  Trust me by the time the movie started I knew which cup size they preferred as well as brunettes vs blonde.  I was really worried that I was going to end up getting into with them if they were disrespectful in the movie.  Guess what, never an issue.  This movie was so emotionally wrenching that all I heard from them or really anyone in the audience was an occational, oh F*, or sniffling, yes sniffling.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the place. Didn't matter if they were guy's or girls.

You read the book, you visualize it, but you don't visualize how steep that freaking hill was, or how bad it was falling down it.  You picture the fire fight, but just can't quite get the overwhelming number they were against.  This movie does a great job bringing it to life.  You can't really picture how bad the wounds were.  I knew it in my head, but seeing it and the fact they keep going is just heart stopping and painful.

Accuracy based on book - Mostly.  Rescue of Marcus - a little more Hollywood.  So not perfect, but I think what the movie was going for was getting the emotions right.  The way I feel if is the families left behind are okay with this movie, I am not going to pick at it.  Those are really the only people that have a right to say anything about details.

I loved seeing how the guys interacted before they left, they did a good job of showing how tight knit the team was.  It also brought out Matt Axelson and Danny Dietz and showcased them and their bravery.  I think more people know about Murph or Marcus, and now they will know about Axe and Danny too.  Also everyone on the chopper.  The Seals and Night Stalkers.

The worst part of this movie is knowing you are not getting the ending you want.  You start hoping for it, you watch the fire fight, you know what is going to happen, and you are still devastated when it does.

When we finally left the movie, there were still people just sitting with tears streaming down their face.  So bring Kleenex.  Don't let that deter you from seeing it.  I think this is the best war film ever made, I especially loved the tribute to all that gave their life at the end.  Operation Red Wings is so heartbreaking, I have always said my hero's wear dog tags not jerseys, and I hope more people feel that way after seeing this.

Sorry if this is disjointed, it has been a couple weeks and I am still emotional about it.  Maybe dumb, but I get super emotional over our military.  I will be going to see this again when it is released and taking my Godsons to it.  They need to know what sacrifices are made for our freedoms.

This film is so strong that an hour passes without a shot and yet it seemed only a few minutes and I thought I was watching an action film. To call this an ""action film"" is to diminish it though.... it does contain a LOT of action and carnage so the young boys wanting to watch gunplay will enjoy it but it is so so much more. Ignorant as I was of the best selling book which inspired this movie , it was only as the pre credit sequence ran that I realized this WAS a true story and with many twists, turns, and ultimately a compelling story/ending. There are touches of military stupidity, touches of the ambivalence of fighting in Afghanistan, touches of the futility of battle, and a large dose of the sad lose of life that has been going on for too long and shows no sign of ending ... and while I kept worrying of being hit over the head with a preachy ""message"" ....it never happened... the facts were laid out in a compelling film and we as viewers can take away what we want......
