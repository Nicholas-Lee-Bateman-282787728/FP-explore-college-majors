3003543,1,B000XJD35M,"There are bad movies. There are stupid movies. There are silly, pointless romantic comedies. For others, there should be a scale of badness that's entirely their own. This movie is that movie.

Movies like American Pie and There's Something About Mary are smart stupid comedies, movies like Wedding Daze are just plain stupid.

If you thought Good Luck Chuck and Shallow Hal were horrible, wait until you see the outrageously, intolerable gags in this lowly film.

The whole script is a tutorial on how not to write a screenplay. The entire movie is a Filmmaking 101 lesson - how not to make movies. It's a shame that good actors such as Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher were used, abused rather.

There's usually a reason for not releasing movies in the theater, and this movie rightfully set on the shelf for two years before getting a straight-for-DVD release last week. Nonetheless, that was not enough - in this movie's case, the tape it was recorded on should've been destroyed.",1201219200,2,979,4.809523809523809
3003544,4,B000XJD35M,"It really isn't fair that an awful film like License to Wed received a wide theatrical release while Wedding Daze a.k.a. The Pleasure of Your Company is released direct-to-video (it did receive a limited theatrical release in England in 2007). Both films are romantic comedies about the trials and tribulations of young couples getting married. It's not surprising that this happened because Licensed has a big name star like Robin Williams to help sell it while Daze has a once bankable star (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>'s Jason Biggs) and an up-and-coming actress (Isla Fisher). Both films feature broad comedy mixed with the occasional gross-out gag but License resorts to tired, clich jokes that we've seen a million times before while Daze features quirky humour courtesy of The State alumni Michael Ian Black.

Jason Biggs seems to be channeling the nervous energy of Ben Stiller and the natural likability of Matthew Broderick. His character is a romantic who can't let go of the past. Isla Fisher is her usual charming self with an engaging smile that lights up any room she's in. She's adorable as a girl who wants to lead a more spontaneous life. It turns out that she is just as much a romantic as Anderson. Biggs and Fisher are both adept at physical comedy and are not afraid to look silly. They also have excellent chemistry together and you really root for their characters to succeed.

Wedding Daze hits the usual plot points - spending the first night together and meeting the parents - and gives them an off-kilter spin, like Katie's father who makes orthodox toys for Jewish kids or Anderson's father passing on his cock ring to his son. Daze is reminiscent of David O. Russell's oddball comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flirting-With-Disaster-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001XALTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flirting With Disaster (Collector's Edition)</a>. Both adhere to the romantic comedy blueprint and end up embellishing it with quirky characters with odd affectations that set it apart from predictable fare like License to Wed.

As with the similarly abandoned comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idiocracy/dp/B000K7VHOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idiocracy</a>, Fox has included hardly any extras on the Wedding Daze DVD. All we get are three deleted scenes that include an alternate opening which wisely was not used and a fantasy sequence with Anderson's dead girlfriend.",1200614400,2,2689,6.089709762532982
3003545,4,B000XJD35M,"Not quite what I would have expected (based on trailers in advertisements), but not bad.  Given the leads, and backgrounds of same, I expected something more along the lines of say American Pie or Wedding Crashers, but this was rather tame.  Note that says tame, not lame.  Released straight to video, rather than going to theatres, one might think the movie here isn't worth the time, but that isn't true.  Perhaps somewhat in line with the American Pie 'wedding movie', this one is certainly formulaic but delivers a cute movie if you care to sit and watch it.

Anderson (Jason Biggs) has his anticipated fiance unexpectedly become, well, unavailable.  Heartbroken, not ready to move on, despite his best friend telling him that his relationship wasn't ready to move on to the next level begin with, he's somewhat dared into striking up a new relationship.  One that by chances happens to involve Kate (Wedding Crasher's crazy red head Isla Fisher).  So starts a rushed romantic relationship as the two characters propose to each other, accept the proposals and then question whether or not their relationship is a a good or bad thing.  Can they actually make it through to getting married, or will the baggage each carries ruin things before they can even get started?

The comedy isn't quite as low-brow (for the most part) as any of the American Pie movies, or say Saving Silverman (another Biggs starring role) would be, but there are some funny scenes stolen by Anderson's parents and Katie's as well.

Coarse language at times, sexual content/suggestive behavior, probably deserved of the R rating that is carried for this one.  Distributed as a flipper disc with widescreen on one side, full screen (why does anyone still buy anything in that format?!!?) on the other.  A few deleted/extended scenes included as extras.",1200528000,7,1828,4.954098360655737

3004025,2,B000XJD35M,"Actor/writer Michael Ian Black is known for his appearance on TV series such as ""Reaper"", ""The State"", ""Reno 911', ""Ed"" and most recently on the series ""Backwash"".

Known for his comedy, Black had the opportunity to write and direct his first romantic comedy feature film ""Wedding Daze"" starring Jason Biggs (""American Pie"" films, ""Loser"") and Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Rango"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"").

The 2006 film features Biggs as the protagonist Anderson.  A person who is very much in love with his girlfriend Vanessa (played by Audra Blaser), a young woman who Anderson considers ""perfect"".

So, what best than to give her the perfect proposal for marriage to show his love for her.

Unfortunately, for Anderson, his plan is to dress up as Cupid and visit her at the restaurant to propose to her.  His best friend Ted (played by Michael Weston) can't believe what Anderson is about to do and disagrees with his plan and thinks it is embarrassing but for Anderson, he feels that he knows Vanessa and its the best way to propose to her.

While both argue outside the restaurant on who is right and who is wrong, Vanessa is being schmoozed by the waiter Morty (played by Mark Consuelos) and you can tell that Vanessa is starting to become quite interested in him.

Meanwhile, Anderson wins the argument and goes to propose to Vanessa.  Shocked by the proposal, Vanessa is so happy that she has a heart attack and dies.

From that moment on, Anderson is a mess and one-year later, he is seen as a much bigger mess.  Everywhere around him is something that reminds him of his dead girlfriend and he can't get over her.

One day, his friend Ted asks him to join him and grab a bit to eat a restaurant.  And Ted tells him bluntly that he has to get over Vanessa and move on.

Anderson said he can't because she's so perfect.

But Ted insists that he take a look at other women and start over.  Ted looks around and all he sees are older women that smoke and then catches the eye of a waitress in the restaurant.

Anderson tells him that if he does go out with a girl and gives it a try, will he get off his back.  Ted agrees.

So, the waitress goes to take their order and the first thing that comes out of Anderson's mouth is ""Will you marry me?"" and surprisingly the waitress says ""yes!"" and accepts his proposal.

The story then showcases the waitress named Katie (played by Isla Fisher).

The story goes back a few days before the proposal and Katie is dating a man who is very feminine.  Her parents Lois (played by Joanna Gleason) and Stuart (played by Matt Maloy) love him but Katie is not sure if she loves him at all.  In fact, her boyfriend proposes to her and she tells him that ""she'll think about it"".

The next day, her mother can't believe that she is not accepting the proposal from a perfect guy.  Confused about her boyfriend, she goes to her father Smitty (played by Joe Pantoliano) who is in prison, and tells her about her boyfriend's proposal and how she is not happy about it.

She goes back to work and tries to convince herself that she is happy about the marriage proposal and tells her friends and co workers Jane (played by Heather Goldenhersh) and Matador (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) about how she feels and Matador is quick to tell her that he doesn't like her current boyfriend.

And then we see the proposal once again, in which Katie says ""yes"" to Anderson.

Both agree to take things slow and live with each other.  But still, Anderson feels guilty and starts thinking about Vanessa not approving of his decision to marry Katie.  When Katie asks who is the woman that is pictured in his room, he tells her that it's Vanessa, a photo frame model and the reason why he is pictured with her is that he is a former model for a picture frame company.  Katie doesn't question it and believes him.

But both spend time with each other and enjoy each other's company.

Meanwhile, Anderson introduces Katie to his parents, Katie introduces Anderson to her parents and sure enough, the parents don't agree with their children's choice of who they are going to marry.  But Katie learns from Anderson's mother Betsy (played by Margo Martindale) that Vanessa is actually Anderson's girlfriend who passed away and is distraught that Anderson had lied to her.

The two get into a huge fight and it looks as if their brief relationship is over and the marriage is off.

And while they spend time away from each other for a brief time, both Anderson and Katie realize, they are actually falling for each other and want to get married.

And now with the help of Ted and Katie's friends, everyone takes off to Atlantic City for Anderson and Katie's wedding but in the process, Ted takes a car from the car lot that he works at and tells his boss it's for a test drive (and because he hasn't returned it, his boss calls the cops) and Katie's father has broken out of prison (and the cops are after him).  To make things worse, Katie's former boyfriend has followed Anderson and Katie and wants to fight Anderson.

With all these obstacles, will Anderson and Katie ever get married?

VIDEO:

""Wedding Daze"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Picture quality for the film is quite vibrant, black levels are pretty good considering this is a catalog title and I detected no artifacting, no edge enhancement on the video.  For the most part, fans of the film should be pleased with the picture quality and vibrant colors.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Wedding Daze"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 DTS and French 5.1 DTS.  The film is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is clear and understandable as is the music coming from the front and center channels.  There are some moments where the surround channels are used.  When Isla shoots a gun into the ceiling or when Matador steps on the brakes of his car, you can hear the surround channels being utilized.

But for this romantic comedy, it's a front and center channel driven soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Wedding Daze"" comes with an alternate opening sequence and two deleted scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Wedding Daze"" is a romantic comedy that has a few jokes that will make you laugh and has potential to be entertaining.  Somehow, during its final half hour, it becomes uninspired and loses its humor and eventually becomes too kitschy for anyone to really enjoy.

As someone who grew up watching Jason Biggs on the ""American Pie"" films and also have been entertained by actress Isla Fisher in a few of her films, the idea to have a film that revolves around a shotgun wedding is sure to bring some laughs, especially with Michael Ian Black writing and directing the film.

First, the good.  The good is that the premise of the story of two individuals trying out a relationship and getting married, despite not spending any time together is quite interesting and can be entertaining.  Both characters, Anderson and Katie are normal people, it's just those that are around them are not.

And the storyline that is built around those characters is pretty much out of left-field and very crazy.

Anderson's father is hardcore into sex and gives Anderson his cock ring as a gift for his marriage, while his mother threatens Katie that she will cut her if she brings up Vanessa's name.  As for Katie's mother, she is married to a shy Jewish man who has built a Jewnicorn and wants to make it to a toyline, while her mother still thinks about having mad, passionate sex with her ex-husband.

Throw in Katie's co-workers, Jane who wants to be in the circus and throws knives while Matador is just a strange individual.

Needless to say, there are some funny moments in the film as Katie tries to be sexy for her fiance, tasting Anderson's toothpaste dribble around his mouth and he accidentally spitting it out on her eye and temporary blinding her.  I couldn't help but laugh.

But from there on, things become too kitschy as Michael Ian Black somehow changes the pacing and has everything focus on the group going to jail, breaking out of jail and having the police after them.  It worked great during the Laurel & Hardy and Buster Keaton silent years but to focus a romantic comedy so much on it, especially for its climax, unfortunately instead of peaking, the storyline goes downhill and never recovers.

Actually, I had more fun watching the ending credits with the talent having fun and messing around than what was taking place in the final 20 minutes of the actual storyline of the film.

""Wedding Daze"" is a Blu-ray release that features vibrant and solid PQ and the lossless audio soundtrack is about what I would expect from a romantic comedy.  Special features are few with only an alternative opening sequence and two deleted scenes, all three which I'm glad were cut out of the film.

Needless to say,  I'm sure Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher fans will have fun watching the film but while the film has its fun and charming moments, much of those moments happen earlier on and the storyline doesn't get any better.

Overall, ""Wedding Daze"" is popcorn romantic comedy that is not the best, nor is it the worst but its storyline suffers from lackadaisical writing and an uninspiring way to end the film that it comes up short.",1312156800,,9325,4.6414634146341465

The idea isn't that original but the actors throw themselves into it so wholeheartedly that you don't really notice. There are a few laugh out loud moments and the rest in pretty amusing too. It isn't too long so you shouldn't get bored. Overall this film is inoffensive and fairly amusing, worth a viewing if you've a spare afternoon to kill.

3004028,3,B000XJD35M,"The film certainly feels like a `straight to video' comedy, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't work as a comedy.  There are many scenes where the laughs keep coming, and with reckless abandon at that, but the film never is able to shake that feeling that this was low-brow and under-produced.

It just feels lacking.

The film stars the vivacious Isla Fisher and the `where has he been' star of `American Pie', Jason Biggs.  Jason plays Anderson, a young and in love man who accidentally scares his fianc&eacute; to death when he proposes dresses up as Cupid.  Still in mourning a year later, he happens to meet the young and spontaneous Katie who is running from a proposal herself.  On a whim (or a dare, however you want to interpret that) he asks her to marry him and she accepts.  Now, both Anderson and Katie have a long list of quirks and issues of their own, but together they make such a mismatched pair that you can't help but see how `meant for each other' they truly are.

For me, the films main faults is that it runs out of comedic ideas too soon.  It doesn't know how to sustain the intriguing plot.  Instead, it falls into the rut of delivering one overdone gross-out gag after another.  It doesn't know the word subtlety, and it doesn't understand the importance of variety.  That said, when it nails something, it nails it hard.  On top of that, Fisher is just plain ridiculously watchable; I mean, you're eyes never want to leave her.  Biggs seems grown up, which is a good thing.  I could actually see him becoming a honed leading man, that is if he ever gets good work again.  The supporting cast is hit or miss, with some of their side-plots getting in the way of the film being truly wonderful.  Joanna Gleason is probably my favorite of the supporting cast.  Joe Pantoliano is probably my least favorite.

While there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to complain about here, there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to praise either.  The film just rest comfortably in the middle.  It's a forgettable yet enjoyable film.  I really liked the premise but I felt it was underdeveloped in an exchange for cheap gags that are too overused in comedies today.

And what was up with Edward Herrmann and Margo Martindale?  That couple was so strangely bi-polar, and their comedic efforts reaped similar rewards.  I found their overdone love life to grow tired after the 3rd or 4th gag, but I found Martindale's `out of the blue' gangster turn in the kitchen (""I'll cut you!"") to be ROLL ON THE FLOOR HILARIOUS!

See this film, and then decide for yourself.",1284681600,2,2568,4.613686534216336

3004051,3,B000XJD35M,"Wedding Daze came and went at the theatres here.  After seeing a trailer online that suggested a funny if completely absurd film, I never saw another thing about this film.  It didn't receive very positive reviews, didn't stay long in the theatres and didn't really catch my attention until I noticed it was on Netflix's ""View Now"" roster.  So, I decided to give it a late chance and came away with a smile.

Let's get one thing clear: the movie is ridiculous.  Boy Meets Girl.  Boy accidently kills girl.  Boy is sad.  Boy meets second girl and instantly proposes on a lark.  Girl says yes.  Hijinks ensue.  What this means for Wedding Daze is that Anderson (Jason Biggs) proposes to his girlfiend who is so shocked, she has a heart attack.  He becomes inconsolable until his best friend forces him to ask out the next girl he sees.  At this moment, Anderson meets Katie (Isla Fisher) and, instead of asking her out, asks her to marry him.  She says yes, shocking both of them, and then the aforementioned hijinks (and awkwardness) abound.

It's a pretty silly movie, written and directed by the equally silly Michael Ian Black, that works only because of the inspired casting.  The two leads, Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher, have always been perfect comedic choices and they are zany and funny here.  Even when the story gets a little long in the tooth and extends a bit further than it probably should, they keep it mostly afloat.  It feels like the grownup cousin of Saving Silverman, another absurd-but-decent comedy.  And it can get away with a bit more with its R rating.  However, as far as raunchy R-rated movies, it's pretty tame.

3004054,2,B000XJD35M,"This movie's plot HAD potential.  I don't know where it went, but it WASN'T in the final cut of the movie.

Not that the main actors involved didn't turn in good performances.  Jason Biggs has gotten his one-trick pony of pathologically-spastic-eccentric-geek-stunts/""potty humor"" performance down pat.  (Not as much of a compliment as that might sound, Jason!)  Isla Fisher turns out to be the bright side of this movie, turning in a fresh and genuine performance that nicely compliments her physical beauty.

Love is not an emotion--contrary to popular opinion.  Love is a decision.  Even the best relationships do not FEEL the emotion all the time.  This movie COULD have chosen to emphasize the fact that in all marriages there comes a time when you must continue to CHOOSE to love the other person.  That love is a decision you make daily, is the mechanism of how arranged marriages have worked down through the ages in multiple cultures.  (Don't get me wrong--I'm not advocating arranged marriages; this is just to illustrate and emphasize my point.)

By its wild exaggeration of decision over emotion, the premise of this movie could have made the point that a committed marriage CAN result from sheer force of wills and the valuing of commitment.  The movie COULD HAVE chosen to emphasize these positive things that are sorely needed in this age of near-universal devaluation of marriage and easy divorce--but it didn't.

Instead, it emphasizes the feelings which most people confuse with love anyway.  By the glorification of entering into marriage frivolously, it suggests that love and a stable marriage can come without thought, without doing any the SANE things that dating couples should be doing prior to marriage to discern whether someone is a proper mate.  In the process, it takes every opportunity to demean and degrade the institute and sacrament of marriage.

Sadly, there are also several examples of the ""lowest common denominator"" bathroom humor and impurity/immorality that one associates with Jason Biggs and the ""American Pie"" crowd.

There is some good writing in this movie, and several (non-bathroom humor) laugh-out-loud moments.  Those and the aforementioned performance by Isla Fisher are the reasons I didn't give this only one star.  This is a good movie to see for free--and even then you may feel cheated.  I certainly recommend against buying it.

The DVD is of average quality, with scant extra features--but then again, perhaps that's a plus.",1207872000,,2483,5.124378109452737
3004055,2,B000XJD35M,"The movie does have it's funny moments. Though a lot of it's jokes are pushed for, which gives you that awkward feeling where you feel bad for the actors at the time... heh. But like I said, there are some funny moments in the movie, more than I expected, which is why this movie didn't get a one star from me. Actually Isla Fisher helped the movie also. Her acting might not be that believable at times, but at least she's doesn't hurt the eyes.

Now you're probably wondering what the movie is about so I'll let you know real quick. This is what makes the movie bad. The whole plot itself. Anderson is broken hearted a year after his planned proposal didn't go so well. His friend tries to get him to date again, but instead he just likes to mope. With much begging from the friend, Anderson finally agrees, but instead of asking a girl to go on a date, he jokingly (sorta jokingly), asks a girl, Katie (Isla Fisher), to marry him. She was just asked by her boyfriend to get married, but she doesn't want to marry him, so instead she agrees to marry Anderson.

Stop right there and soak that in ladies and gentleman. A beautiful girl...just agreed to marry some strange normal looking guy...in a diner. This is not a joke.

Ok lets turn back to the movie. So since they are getting married, they decide to go out and get to know one another....meet parents...move in together...meet each others friends. During these encounters are when the funny moments occur (or are supposed to occur)...or maybe when the `romantic' parts of this RomCom are supposed to occur. I didn't find it of the sappy parts to be believable. ""Why?"" you ask. BECAUSE THEY JUST MET LIKE A DAY AGO. I personally believe in love at first sight, but this just was not that.

Is the movie worth watching at least? Yeah sure. You can't go wrong with laughing, and this movie will make you laugh sometimes. It's not really a BAD movie; it's just really hard to get into since you can't believe in it. But I did catch myself laughing actually out loud at some parts. SOME parts.

One last thing. Jason Biggs is a one track actor. I swear he needs to just be in every American Pie movie because that's all I ever see him as since his acting just never changes.",1207440000,2,2227,4.408759124087592

Anderson (Jason Biggs) is in what he believes to be a committed relationship to the woman of his dreams. He intends to propose to her dressed as cupid at a fancy restaurant but the proposal goes awry and leaves Anderson's Fianc to be, dead of shock. Anderson is devastated by the loss and left feeling that he will never fall in love again. A year passes and Anderson hasn't gotten out of his slump. Anderson's friend Ted (Michael Weston) suggests that Anderson won't find happiness again unless he tries to find it. At his suggestion Anderson ask the next girl he sees to marry him who happens to be, Katie (Isla Fisher) who is in a relationship with a guy who her mother loves although she isn't so sure she loves him. Her boyfriend had recently proposed over a family game of charades but Katie wasn't sure and said she had to think about it. For some reason she feels Andersons proposal is a good idea even though she has never even met him and agrees to marry him on the spot and comedic hilarity ensues......

This has to be some of the worst script writing that has ever made it to film. I really feel bad for Biggs and Isla Fisher because I really like both of them but this cant be a good indicator of things to come.

The Good: ?????

The Bad: None of the comedic situations in this movie worked. The words Hackneyed and trite come to mind when thinking about them. A lot of the comedic moments felt like poor ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>"" rip offs.  The end result was a comedy that wasn't funny at all.

The overall plot and story are implausible at best and ludicrous at worst which would have been fine if writer/director Michael Black was attempting to take us on a ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dude-Where-s-My-Car/dp/B00003CXS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dude, Where's My Car?</a>?"" type ride. It seems like he tried slip seamlessly between that genre and the slightly more realistic situation comedy genre ala ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>"" and it just didn't work. This left the movie with a very awkward ""Hodge podge"" type tone which left you wondering how seriously you were supposed to be taking the characters or subject matter.

3004059,3,B000XJD35M,"With Wedding Daze (formally The Pleasure of Your Company), the directorial debut from Michael Ian Black, I expected a romantic comedy in the vein of Wedding Crashers... though that is probably only because both star Isla Fisher... what I got, though, was a gag-full American Pie-esque romp centering on two individuals with just the right amount of crazy that makes it hard to root for them either separately, let alone together.
When the opening credits rolled, I clapped with glee over the potential: Joanna Gleason (Kim from Friends) played Katie (Fisher)'s mother, a skeletal Joe Pantoliano as her father, Heather Goldenhersh (Lizzy Caplan's sister on The Class) as her best friend, and Matt Malloy as her adoptive father... not to mention the aforementioned Edward Herrmann as Anderson (Jason Biggs)'s father.  Herrmann is a man I've loved since he played Macaulay Culkin's father in Richie Rich, and I will pretty much give anything he's in a try, allowing it the benefit of the doubt because he's such a classy, intelligent actor that he must choose his projects with care.  His first scene in Wedding Daze made me shake my head and exclaim: ""Oh, Richard Gilmore, no.  Just no!"" as his on-screen wife licked whipped cream from his face.  Unfortunately the ones that followed (presenting his son with his c*ck ring; watching two naked women less than half his age make out on a rug in front of a fire in his living room) just proved that not even the cast could save this crude romantic comedy.

Wedding Daze starts off simply enough: a young romantic's whole world crashes down around him when the girlfriend to whom he is in the middle of proposing collapses on the floor in front of him.  He spirals, needless to say, and decides on an impetuous whim to propose to the woman currently waiting on him in some roadhouse diner.  Luckily, she is just as spontaneous (read: nuts) as he is, and though she had been pondering a proposal from her Charades-loving boyfriend, she needs nothing but a split second to scream in joy and accept the hand (though no ring) of Anderson.  Fisher is one of a handful of this generation's true comedic gems, whose talent would be best suited in a female-centric piece in which she can really shine.  Needless to say, Wedding Daze is not one such piece, and in it, she is forced to take a backseat to prop humor (a diaphragm ending up in a sandwich... is that the best you could do?  Really?) and the much more one-note Biggs.  He relies on his bright white smile to endear his audiences, but years after first winning them over as a big-eyed, geek-chic teenager, the act (like himself) has just grown old; he has not matured.

Katie and Anderson go through the usual dance of trying to fit into one another's worlds and overcoming the obstacles of different families and friends but still come out on the other side wanting to get married.  I think they have known each other for about four days at that point.  The movie picks up quickly from there, as the duo steal a car to elope, all the while Katie's mother and biological father hold up a hardware store to get their daughter the money for a proper wedding.  Arresting chaos ensues, including a cameo standoff with Rob Corddry, and Katie delivers her ""Despite all of our insane obstacles and the red flags advising us otherwise, I want to be with you"" speech while both families are behind bars.  Her words-from-the-heart (or perhaps the gun she shoots at the ceiling) is somehow enough to convince everyone (perhaps because it's the eight-minute mark, and for a comedy this thin, that's nearing the end) because thirty seconds later, they are marching down the aisle at the little Atlantic City wedding chapel at which her own parents eloped twenty-odd years ago.  The Reverend tells the happy couple that he can personally guarantee anyone who marries at his establishment will be happy forever, but it's way too late for the love affair with this movie.
(Though I will admit the ""Jewnicorn"" and ""Jewlahoop"" did elicit a chuckle.)

Wedding Daze should have ended there, but Black (who was a hybrid on this project) just couldn't end on a genuinely sweet (albeit completely unrealistic) moment.  Instead, he gave us another six or seven minutes of drawn-out residual drama in the form of a mock-police standoff, at which point I had had more than enough and just ended the $3.95 rental prematurely.  Michael, I still love you for your witty Stella performances and snappy VH1 Countdown Lists commentary, but please, please, please stick to in front of the camera work until your sense of humor hits puberty.",1203120000,3,4603,4.773299748110831

3238040,1,B000XJD35M,"There are bad movies. There are stupid movies. There are silly, pointless romantic comedies. For others, there should be a scale of badness that's entirely their own. This movie is that movie.

Movies like American Pie and There's Something About Mary are smart stupid comedies, movies like Wedding Daze are just plain stupid.

If you thought Good Luck Chuck and Shallow Hal were horrible, wait until you see the outrageously, intolerable gags in this lowly film.

The whole script is a tutorial on how not to write a screenplay. The entire movie is a Filmmaking 101 lesson - how not to make movies. It's a shame that good actors such as Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher were used, abused rather.

There's usually a reason for not releasing movies in the theater, and this movie rightfully set on the shelf for two years before getting a straight-for-DVD release last week. Nonetheless, that was not enough - in this movie's case, the tape it was recorded on should've been destroyed.",1201219200,2,979,4.809523809523809
3238041,4,B000XJD35M,"It really isn't fair that an awful film like License to Wed received a wide theatrical release while Wedding Daze a.k.a. The Pleasure of Your Company is released direct-to-video (it did receive a limited theatrical release in England in 2007). Both films are romantic comedies about the trials and tribulations of young couples getting married. It's not surprising that this happened because Licensed has a big name star like Robin Williams to help sell it while Daze has a once bankable star (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>'s Jason Biggs) and an up-and-coming actress (Isla Fisher). Both films feature broad comedy mixed with the occasional gross-out gag but License resorts to tired, clich jokes that we've seen a million times before while Daze features quirky humour courtesy of The State alumni Michael Ian Black.

Jason Biggs seems to be channeling the nervous energy of Ben Stiller and the natural likability of Matthew Broderick. His character is a romantic who can't let go of the past. Isla Fisher is her usual charming self with an engaging smile that lights up any room she's in. She's adorable as a girl who wants to lead a more spontaneous life. It turns out that she is just as much a romantic as Anderson. Biggs and Fisher are both adept at physical comedy and are not afraid to look silly. They also have excellent chemistry together and you really root for their characters to succeed.

Wedding Daze hits the usual plot points - spending the first night together and meeting the parents - and gives them an off-kilter spin, like Katie's father who makes orthodox toys for Jewish kids or Anderson's father passing on his cock ring to his son. Daze is reminiscent of David O. Russell's oddball comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flirting-With-Disaster-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001XALTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flirting With Disaster (Collector's Edition)</a>. Both adhere to the romantic comedy blueprint and end up embellishing it with quirky characters with odd affectations that set it apart from predictable fare like License to Wed.

3238042,4,B000XJD35M,"Not quite what I would have expected (based on trailers in advertisements), but not bad.  Given the leads, and backgrounds of same, I expected something more along the lines of say American Pie or Wedding Crashers, but this was rather tame.  Note that says tame, not lame.  Released straight to video, rather than going to theatres, one might think the movie here isn't worth the time, but that isn't true.  Perhaps somewhat in line with the American Pie 'wedding movie', this one is certainly formulaic but delivers a cute movie if you care to sit and watch it.

Anderson (Jason Biggs) has his anticipated fiance unexpectedly become, well, unavailable.  Heartbroken, not ready to move on, despite his best friend telling him that his relationship wasn't ready to move on to the next level begin with, he's somewhat dared into striking up a new relationship.  One that by chances happens to involve Kate (Wedding Crasher's crazy red head Isla Fisher).  So starts a rushed romantic relationship as the two characters propose to each other, accept the proposals and then question whether or not their relationship is a a good or bad thing.  Can they actually make it through to getting married, or will the baggage each carries ruin things before they can even get started?

The comedy isn't quite as low-brow (for the most part) as any of the American Pie movies, or say Saving Silverman (another Biggs starring role) would be, but there are some funny scenes stolen by Anderson's parents and Katie's as well.

Coarse language at times, sexual content/suggestive behavior, probably deserved of the R rating that is carried for this one.  Distributed as a flipper disc with widescreen on one side, full screen (why does anyone still buy anything in that format?!!?) on the other.

3238522,2,B000XJD35M,"Actor/writer Michael Ian Black is known for his appearance on TV series such as ""Reaper"", ""The State"", ""Reno 911', ""Ed"" and most recently on the series ""Backwash"".

Known for his comedy, Black had the opportunity to write and direct his first romantic comedy feature film ""Wedding Daze"" starring Jason Biggs (""American Pie"" films, ""Loser"") and Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Rango"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"").

The 2006 film features Biggs as the protagonist Anderson.  A person who is very much in love with his girlfriend Vanessa (played by Audra Blaser), a young woman who Anderson considers ""perfect"".

So, what best than to give her the perfect proposal for marriage to show his love for her.

Unfortunately, for Anderson, his plan is to dress up as Cupid and visit her at the restaurant to propose to her.  His best friend Ted (played by Michael Weston) can't believe what Anderson is about to do and disagrees with his plan and thinks it is embarrassing but for Anderson, he feels that he knows Vanessa and its the best way to propose to her.

While both argue outside the restaurant on who is right and who is wrong, Vanessa is being schmoozed by the waiter Morty (played by Mark Consuelos) and you can tell that Vanessa is starting to become quite interested in him.

Meanwhile, Anderson wins the argument and goes to propose to Vanessa.  Shocked by the proposal, Vanessa is so happy that she has a heart attack and dies.

From that moment on, Anderson is a mess and one-year later, he is seen as a much bigger mess.  Everywhere around him is something that reminds him of his dead girlfriend and he can't get over her.

One day, his friend Ted asks him to join him and grab a bit to eat a restaurant.  And Ted tells him bluntly that he has to get over Vanessa and move on.

Anderson said he can't because she's so perfect.

But Ted insists that he take a look at other women and start over.  Ted looks around and all he sees are older women that smoke and then catches the eye of a waitress in the restaurant.

Anderson tells him that if he does go out with a girl and gives it a try, will he get off his back.  Ted agrees.

So, the waitress goes to take their order and the first thing that comes out of Anderson's mouth is ""Will you marry me?"" and surprisingly the waitress says ""yes!"" and accepts his proposal.

The story then showcases the waitress named Katie (played by Isla Fisher).

The story goes back a few days before the proposal and Katie is dating a man who is very feminine.  Her parents Lois (played by Joanna Gleason) and Stuart (played by Matt Maloy) love him but Katie is not sure if she loves him at all.  In fact, her boyfriend proposes to her and she tells him that ""she'll think about it"".

The next day, her mother can't believe that she is not accepting the proposal from a perfect guy.  Confused about her boyfriend, she goes to her father Smitty (played by Joe Pantoliano) who is in prison, and tells her about her boyfriend's proposal and how she is not happy about it.

She goes back to work and tries to convince herself that she is happy about the marriage proposal and tells her friends and co workers Jane (played by Heather Goldenhersh) and Matador (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) about how she feels and Matador is quick to tell her that he doesn't like her current boyfriend.

And then we see the proposal once again, in which Katie says ""yes"" to Anderson.

Both agree to take things slow and live with each other.  But still, Anderson feels guilty and starts thinking about Vanessa not approving of his decision to marry Katie.  When Katie asks who is the woman that is pictured in his room, he tells her that it's Vanessa, a photo frame model and the reason why he is pictured with her is that he is a former model for a picture frame company.  Katie doesn't question it and believes him.

But both spend time with each other and enjoy each other's company.

Meanwhile, Anderson introduces Katie to his parents, Katie introduces Anderson to her parents and sure enough, the parents don't agree with their children's choice of who they are going to marry.  But Katie learns from Anderson's mother Betsy (played by Margo Martindale) that Vanessa is actually Anderson's girlfriend who passed away and is distraught that Anderson had lied to her.

The two get into a huge fight and it looks as if their brief relationship is over and the marriage is off.

And while they spend time away from each other for a brief time, both Anderson and Katie realize, they are actually falling for each other and want to get married.

And now with the help of Ted and Katie's friends, everyone takes off to Atlantic City for Anderson and Katie's wedding but in the process, Ted takes a car from the car lot that he works at and tells his boss it's for a test drive (and because he hasn't returned it, his boss calls the cops) and Katie's father has broken out of prison (and the cops are after him).  To make things worse, Katie's former boyfriend has followed Anderson and Katie and wants to fight Anderson.

With all these obstacles, will Anderson and Katie ever get married?

VIDEO:

""Wedding Daze"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Picture quality for the film is quite vibrant, black levels are pretty good considering this is a catalog title and I detected no artifacting, no edge enhancement on the video.  For the most part, fans of the film should be pleased with the picture quality and vibrant colors.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Wedding Daze"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 DTS and French 5.1 DTS.  The film is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is clear and understandable as is the music coming from the front and center channels.  There are some moments where the surround channels are used.  When Isla shoots a gun into the ceiling or when Matador steps on the brakes of his car, you can hear the surround channels being utilized.

But for this romantic comedy, it's a front and center channel driven soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Wedding Daze"" comes with an alternate opening sequence and two deleted scenes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Wedding Daze"" is a romantic comedy that has a few jokes that will make you laugh and has potential to be entertaining.  Somehow, during its final half hour, it becomes uninspired and loses its humor and eventually becomes too kitschy for anyone to really enjoy.

As someone who grew up watching Jason Biggs on the ""American Pie"" films and also have been entertained by actress Isla Fisher in a few of her films, the idea to have a film that revolves around a shotgun wedding is sure to bring some laughs, especially with Michael Ian Black writing and directing the film.

First, the good.  The good is that the premise of the story of two individuals trying out a relationship and getting married, despite not spending any time together is quite interesting and can be entertaining.  Both characters, Anderson and Katie are normal people, it's just those that are around them are not.

And the storyline that is built around those characters is pretty much out of left-field and very crazy.

Anderson's father is hardcore into sex and gives Anderson his cock ring as a gift for his marriage, while his mother threatens Katie that she will cut her if she brings up Vanessa's name.  As for Katie's mother, she is married to a shy Jewish man who has built a Jewnicorn and wants to make it to a toyline, while her mother still thinks about having mad, passionate sex with her ex-husband.

Throw in Katie's co-workers, Jane who wants to be in the circus and throws knives while Matador is just a strange individual.

Needless to say, there are some funny moments in the film as Katie tries to be sexy for her fiance, tasting Anderson's toothpaste dribble around his mouth and he accidentally spitting it out on her eye and temporary blinding her.  I couldn't help but laugh.

But from there on, things become too kitschy as Michael Ian Black somehow changes the pacing and has everything focus on the group going to jail, breaking out of jail and having the police after them.  It worked great during the Laurel & Hardy and Buster Keaton silent years but to focus a romantic comedy so much on it, especially for its climax, unfortunately instead of peaking, the storyline goes downhill and never recovers.

Actually, I had more fun watching the ending credits with the talent having fun and messing around than what was taking place in the final 20 minutes of the actual storyline of the film.

""Wedding Daze"" is a Blu-ray release that features vibrant and solid PQ and the lossless audio soundtrack is about what I would expect from a romantic comedy.  Special features are few with only an alternative opening sequence and two deleted scenes, all three which I'm glad were cut out of the film.

Needless to say,  I'm sure Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher fans will have fun watching the film but while the film has its fun and charming moments, much of those moments happen earlier on and the storyline doesn't get any better.

Overall, ""Wedding Daze"" is popcorn romantic comedy that is not the best, nor is it the worst but its storyline suffers from lackadaisical writing and an uninspiring way to end the film that it comes up short.",1312156800,,9325,4.6414634146341465

3238525,3,B000XJD35M,"The film certainly feels like a `straight to video' comedy, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't work as a comedy.  There are many scenes where the laughs keep coming, and with reckless abandon at that, but the film never is able to shake that feeling that this was low-brow and under-produced.

It just feels lacking.

The film stars the vivacious Isla Fisher and the `where has he been' star of `American Pie', Jason Biggs.  Jason plays Anderson, a young and in love man who accidentally scares his fianc&eacute; to death when he proposes dresses up as Cupid.  Still in mourning a year later, he happens to meet the young and spontaneous Katie who is running from a proposal herself.  On a whim (or a dare, however you want to interpret that) he asks her to marry him and she accepts.  Now, both Anderson and Katie have a long list of quirks and issues of their own, but together they make such a mismatched pair that you can't help but see how `meant for each other' they truly are.

For me, the films main faults is that it runs out of comedic ideas too soon.  It doesn't know how to sustain the intriguing plot.  Instead, it falls into the rut of delivering one overdone gross-out gag after another.  It doesn't know the word subtlety, and it doesn't understand the importance of variety.  That said, when it nails something, it nails it hard.  On top of that, Fisher is just plain ridiculously watchable; I mean, you're eyes never want to leave her.  Biggs seems grown up, which is a good thing.  I could actually see him becoming a honed leading man, that is if he ever gets good work again.  The supporting cast is hit or miss, with some of their side-plots getting in the way of the film being truly wonderful.  Joanna Gleason is probably my favorite of the supporting cast.  Joe Pantoliano is probably my least favorite.

While there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to complain about here, there isn't really anything GIGANTIC to praise either.  The film just rest comfortably in the middle.  It's a forgettable yet enjoyable film.  I really liked the premise but I felt it was underdeveloped in an exchange for cheap gags that are too overused in comedies today.

And what was up with Edward Herrmann and Margo Martindale?  That couple was so strangely bi-polar, and their comedic efforts reaped similar rewards.  I found their overdone love life to grow tired after the 3rd or 4th gag, but I found Martindale's `out of the blue' gangster turn in the kitchen (""I'll cut you!"") to be ROLL ON THE FLOOR HILARIOUS!

See this film, and then decide for yourself.",1284681600,2,2568,4.613686534216336

3238548,3,B000XJD35M,"Wedding Daze came and went at the theatres here.  After seeing a trailer online that suggested a funny if completely absurd film, I never saw another thing about this film.  It didn't receive very positive reviews, didn't stay long in the theatres and didn't really catch my attention until I noticed it was on Netflix's ""View Now"" roster.  So, I decided to give it a late chance and came away with a smile.

Let's get one thing clear: the movie is ridiculous.  Boy Meets Girl.  Boy accidently kills girl.  Boy is sad.  Boy meets second girl and instantly proposes on a lark.  Girl says yes.  Hijinks ensue.  What this means for Wedding Daze is that Anderson (Jason Biggs) proposes to his girlfiend who is so shocked, she has a heart attack.  He becomes inconsolable until his best friend forces him to ask out the next girl he sees.  At this moment, Anderson meets Katie (Isla Fisher) and, instead of asking her out, asks her to marry him.  She says yes, shocking both of them, and then the aforementioned hijinks (and awkwardness) abound.

It's a pretty silly movie, written and directed by the equally silly Michael Ian Black, that works only because of the inspired casting.  The two leads, Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher, have always been perfect comedic choices and they are zany and funny here.  Even when the story gets a little long in the tooth and extends a bit further than it probably should, they keep it mostly afloat.  It feels like the grownup cousin of Saving Silverman, another absurd-but-decent comedy.  And it can get away with a bit more with its R rating.

3238550,5,B000XJD35M,I have not seen a movie so simple and touching for a long time.  The casts are easy and the whole story is so romantic (somewhat not very real).  I would recommand this movie to all the people who lives with love.  This is a wonderful movie.  I need one for my collection.,1209168000,2,272,4.0754716981132075
3238551,2,B000XJD35M,"This movie's plot HAD potential.  I don't know where it went, but it WASN'T in the final cut of the movie.

Not that the main actors involved didn't turn in good performances.  Jason Biggs has gotten his one-trick pony of pathologically-spastic-eccentric-geek-stunts/""potty humor"" performance down pat.  (Not as much of a compliment as that might sound, Jason!)  Isla Fisher turns out to be the bright side of this movie, turning in a fresh and genuine performance that nicely compliments her physical beauty.

Love is not an emotion--contrary to popular opinion.  Love is a decision.  Even the best relationships do not FEEL the emotion all the time.  This movie COULD have chosen to emphasize the fact that in all marriages there comes a time when you must continue to CHOOSE to love the other person.  That love is a decision you make daily, is the mechanism of how arranged marriages have worked down through the ages in multiple cultures.  (Don't get me wrong--I'm not advocating arranged marriages; this is just to illustrate and emphasize my point.)

By its wild exaggeration of decision over emotion, the premise of this movie could have made the point that a committed marriage CAN result from sheer force of wills and the valuing of commitment.  The movie COULD HAVE chosen to emphasize these positive things that are sorely needed in this age of near-universal devaluation of marriage and easy divorce--but it didn't.

Instead, it emphasizes the feelings which most people confuse with love anyway.  By the glorification of entering into marriage frivolously, it suggests that love and a stable marriage can come without thought, without doing any the SANE things that dating couples should be doing prior to marriage to discern whether someone is a proper mate.  In the process, it takes every opportunity to demean and degrade the institute and sacrament of marriage.

Sadly, there are also several examples of the ""lowest common denominator"" bathroom humor and impurity/immorality that one associates with Jason Biggs and the ""American Pie"" crowd.

There is some good writing in this movie, and several (non-bathroom humor) laugh-out-loud moments.  Those and the aforementioned performance by Isla Fisher are the reasons I didn't give this only one star.  This is a good movie to see for free--and even then you may feel cheated.  I certainly recommend against buying it.

The DVD is of average quality, with scant extra features--but then again, perhaps that's a plus.",1207872000,,2483,5.124378109452737
3238552,2,B000XJD35M,"The movie does have it's funny moments. Though a lot of it's jokes are pushed for, which gives you that awkward feeling where you feel bad for the actors at the time... heh. But like I said, there are some funny moments in the movie, more than I expected, which is why this movie didn't get a one star from me. Actually Isla Fisher helped the movie also. Her acting might not be that believable at times, but at least she's doesn't hurt the eyes.

Now you're probably wondering what the movie is about so I'll let you know real quick. This is what makes the movie bad. The whole plot itself. Anderson is broken hearted a year after his planned proposal didn't go so well. His friend tries to get him to date again, but instead he just likes to mope. With much begging from the friend, Anderson finally agrees, but instead of asking a girl to go on a date, he jokingly (sorta jokingly), asks a girl, Katie (Isla Fisher), to marry him. She was just asked by her boyfriend to get married, but she doesn't want to marry him, so instead she agrees to marry Anderson.

Stop right there and soak that in ladies and gentleman. A beautiful girl...just agreed to marry some strange normal looking guy...in a diner. This is not a joke.

Ok lets turn back to the movie. So since they are getting married, they decide to go out and get to know one another....meet parents...move in together...meet each others friends. During these encounters are when the funny moments occur (or are supposed to occur)...or maybe when the `romantic' parts of this RomCom are supposed to occur. I didn't find it of the sappy parts to be believable. ""Why?"" you ask. BECAUSE THEY JUST MET LIKE A DAY AGO. I personally believe in love at first sight, but this just was not that.

Is the movie worth watching at least? Yeah sure. You can't go wrong with laughing, and this movie will make you laugh sometimes. It's not really a BAD movie; it's just really hard to get into since you can't believe in it. But I did catch myself laughing actually out loud at some parts. SOME parts.

One last thing. Jason Biggs is a one track actor. I swear he needs to just be in every American Pie movie because that's all I ever see him as since his acting just never changes.",1207440000,2,2227,4.408759124087592

I'm glad I was able to get it free at the library as I would have been mad if I spent a dime.  I gave it one star as both parents of both main characters did have a few funny things going but other than that...train wreck.,1207008000,,384,4.0

3238555,1,B000XJD35M,"""Wedding Daze"" Written and directed by Ian Michael Black, also released as ""The Pleasure of Your Company"".

Anderson (Jason Biggs) is in what he believes to be a committed relationship to the woman of his dreams. He intends to propose to her dressed as cupid at a fancy restaurant but the proposal goes awry and leaves Anderson's Fianc to be, dead of shock. Anderson is devastated by the loss and left feeling that he will never fall in love again. A year passes and Anderson hasn't gotten out of his slump. Anderson's friend Ted (Michael Weston) suggests that Anderson won't find happiness again unless he tries to find it. At his suggestion Anderson ask the next girl he sees to marry him who happens to be, Katie (Isla Fisher) who is in a relationship with a guy who her mother loves although she isn't so sure she loves him. Her boyfriend had recently proposed over a family game of charades but Katie wasn't sure and said she had to think about it. For some reason she feels Andersons proposal is a good idea even though she has never even met him and agrees to marry him on the spot and comedic hilarity ensues......

This has to be some of the worst script writing that has ever made it to film. I really feel bad for Biggs and Isla Fisher because I really like both of them but this cant be a good indicator of things to come.

The Good: ?????

The Bad: None of the comedic situations in this movie worked. The words Hackneyed and trite come to mind when thinking about them. A lot of the comedic moments felt like poor ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>"" rip offs.  The end result was a comedy that wasn't funny at all.

The overall plot and story are implausible at best and ludicrous at worst which would have been fine if writer/director Michael Black was attempting to take us on a ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dude-Where-s-My-Car/dp/B00003CXS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dude, Where's My Car?</a>?"" type ride. It seems like he tried slip seamlessly between that genre and the slightly more realistic situation comedy genre ala ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TZJBPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>"" and it just didn't work. This left the movie with a very awkward ""Hodge podge"" type tone which left you wondering how seriously you were supposed to be taking the characters or subject matter.

Overall: If you need to see Biggs in a movie about weddings check out ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Wedding-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JMCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Wedding - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>"".

3238556,3,B000XJD35M,"With Wedding Daze (formally The Pleasure of Your Company), the directorial debut from Michael Ian Black, I expected a romantic comedy in the vein of Wedding Crashers... though that is probably only because both star Isla Fisher... what I got, though, was a gag-full American Pie-esque romp centering on two individuals with just the right amount of crazy that makes it hard to root for them either separately, let alone together.
When the opening credits rolled, I clapped with glee over the potential: Joanna Gleason (Kim from Friends) played Katie (Fisher)'s mother, a skeletal Joe Pantoliano as her father, Heather Goldenhersh (Lizzy Caplan's sister on The Class) as her best friend, and Matt Malloy as her adoptive father... not to mention the aforementioned Edward Herrmann as Anderson (Jason Biggs)'s father.  Herrmann is a man I've loved since he played Macaulay Culkin's father in Richie Rich, and I will pretty much give anything he's in a try, allowing it the benefit of the doubt because he's such a classy, intelligent actor that he must choose his projects with care.  His first scene in Wedding Daze made me shake my head and exclaim: ""Oh, Richard Gilmore, no.  Just no!"" as his on-screen wife licked whipped cream from his face.  Unfortunately the ones that followed (presenting his son with his c*ck ring; watching two naked women less than half his age make out on a rug in front of a fire in his living room) just proved that not even the cast could save this crude romantic comedy.

Wedding Daze starts off simply enough: a young romantic's whole world crashes down around him when the girlfriend to whom he is in the middle of proposing collapses on the floor in front of him.  He spirals, needless to say, and decides on an impetuous whim to propose to the woman currently waiting on him in some roadhouse diner.  Luckily, she is just as spontaneous (read: nuts) as he is, and though she had been pondering a proposal from her Charades-loving boyfriend, she needs nothing but a split second to scream in joy and accept the hand (though no ring) of Anderson.  Fisher is one of a handful of this generation's true comedic gems, whose talent would be best suited in a female-centric piece in which she can really shine.  Needless to say, Wedding Daze is not one such piece, and in it, she is forced to take a backseat to prop humor (a diaphragm ending up in a sandwich... is that the best you could do?  Really?) and the much more one-note Biggs.  He relies on his bright white smile to endear his audiences, but years after first winning them over as a big-eyed, geek-chic teenager, the act (like himself) has just grown old; he has not matured.

Katie and Anderson go through the usual dance of trying to fit into one another's worlds and overcoming the obstacles of different families and friends but still come out on the other side wanting to get married.  I think they have known each other for about four days at that point.  The movie picks up quickly from there, as the duo steal a car to elope, all the while Katie's mother and biological father hold up a hardware store to get their daughter the money for a proper wedding.  Arresting chaos ensues, including a cameo standoff with Rob Corddry, and Katie delivers her ""Despite all of our insane obstacles and the red flags advising us otherwise, I want to be with you"" speech while both families are behind bars.  Her words-from-the-heart (or perhaps the gun she shoots at the ceiling) is somehow enough to convince everyone (perhaps because it's the eight-minute mark, and for a comedy this thin, that's nearing the end) because thirty seconds later, they are marching down the aisle at the little Atlantic City wedding chapel at which her own parents eloped twenty-odd years ago.  The Reverend tells the happy couple that he can personally guarantee anyone who marries at his establishment will be happy forever, but it's way too late for the love affair with this movie.
(Though I will admit the ""Jewnicorn"" and ""Jewlahoop"" did elicit a chuckle.)

Wedding Daze should have ended there, but Black (who was a hybrid on this project) just couldn't end on a genuinely sweet (albeit completely unrealistic) moment.  Instead, he gave us another six or seven minutes of drawn-out residual drama in the form of a mock-police standoff, at which point I had had more than enough and just ended the $3.95 rental prematurely.  Michael, I still love you for your witty Stella performances and snappy VH1 Countdown Lists commentary, but please, please, please stick to in front of the camera work until your sense of humor hits puberty.",1203120000,3,4603,4.773299748110831
