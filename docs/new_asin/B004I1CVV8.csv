4381561,4,B004I1CVV8,A tear jerking love story where daughter travels back in to witness how her parents fell in love.  The title is misleading because I thought it would focus on her mother youth.,1369785600,3,176,4.5
4381562,5,B004I1CVV8,"the young actress was excellent.  the story contrasts the couple in their youth and in later years.  although it doesn't cover the in between years this is something left for reflection.  i was drawn by the young ""mermaid"" story and the simple life depicted on the island.  her spunky but sweet innocence was touching and captivating. loved the bit on the korean translation of ""alright""",1366848000,6,387,4.907692307692308
4381563,4,B004I1CVV8,"A little slow to develop, but this movie is all about romance.  The actress playing the young mother is very, very good.  She acts with her eyes and her emotions are so transparent, you'll love this movie.  The young father is great, the original daughter good and the uncle also good (both as a youngster and old).  Really enjoyed this movie.",1364169600,4,343,4.573770491803279

4381566,3,B004I1CVV8,"I liked the storyline and the way it unfolded, but a couple of the main characters were difficult to like.",1415404800,2,106,4.35
4381567,3,B004I1CVV8,"This movie is basically a love story that unfolds gradually with a daughter who is an only child, and her mother and father. She has a difficult relationship with her mother who is crass and comes from the school of hard knocks, and thus values money above all else. Her family is poor. She works a day job, and her mother does also. For whatever reason, the father is unemployed. Later on, it is revealed that he has health problems. The discovery of her fathers illness, morphs into the main body of the film. The daughter has a journey to learn who her parents really are and where they came from. She goes back in time, to her parents village when they were young. She lives there with her mother and uncle, (in a first person perspective, -as we are observing their lives). She sees how her mother met her father and how they fell in love. Through this journey she begins to understand them and to see life better through their eyes (from their perspective). She grows to know who they were and who they are. She learns to love her parents for who they are, despite their shortcomings and the strained family relations.

I agree with others that the plot is bizarre and hard to follow. The movie is long and moves slowly. The English translation is poor at best (which makes it hard to understand). This movie is a tear jerker. It began to redeem itself towards the end as it made me think of my own family (being an only child), and my relationship with my mother. So in that aspect it kind of hit home. I think much of the world's population could relate in a personal way to the family dynamic and the difficulty of life growing up.

All in all a decent film, but it could have been done better. 2.5 - 3.0 stars is a generous rating. I am a hopeless romantic, but grounded in reality, so I take the middle ground because I think it most accurately represents how good the film is.",1399161600,5,1888,4.360795454545454
4381568,5,B004I1CVV8,Good story and characters. It's the type of story we need to see to remind us that our parents were a lot like us.,1394582400,2,114,3.7916666666666665
4381569,4,B004I1CVV8,"I don't know why I chose to watch this movie...maybe the title intrigued me...but I'm glad I did.  I'm not extremely fond of movies with subtitles, but it was cold and I was in no hurry to get out of bed, so why not.  It was a very touching story with a young lady coming to understand her mother...like we all want to do...by going back in time and meeting her mother as a teenager.  Funny at times.  A good movie...think I'll read the book next!",1393891200,2,447,4.162790697674419
4381570,5,B004I1CVV8,"I saw this at the San Francisco International Film Festival several years ago ... probably 2005?  It deals with love and conflict between mother and daughter, and it's one of the most beautiful films I have seen.  The emotions and storyline ...and the scenery of the island where the young girls goes to look for her father ... it's just spectacular.",1384560000,,350,4.721311475409836
4381571,1,B004I1CVV8,"The story was slow, but adequate, for the first 25 minutes.  The subtitles seemed to be cut off with incomplete words in several parts, with the translation stopped mid-word.  It made it hard to follow the story line.  This movie does not make it on scenery or action alone.",1381968000,2,274,4.551020408163265
4381572,2,B004I1CVV8,"I usually like old foreign films and Japanese are among my favorites, but this one was just too depressing and didn't have much of a point. It was hard to follow and moved way too slowly.",1381708800,,187,4.222222222222222
4381573,5,B004I1CVV8,"This is one of those sweet, small movies focused on people, time and family. The heroine is a young working woman with an awful, crude, swearing mother. There seems to be an unbridgeable gap. Fate, and perhaps magic, take her into her mother's past, and, as so often happens in successful drama, she learns and understands as she follows her mother and father's courtship on a remote Korean island where her mother works as a pearl diver. The movie used the island setting to give a real sense of time and place, adding much to appeal and power of the story. I couldn't help thinking of such films as Local Hero and I Know Where I Am Going.

Sorry, but there are no big shoot 'em ups and no pat conclusions. The epilog is touching. The actress who plays both the modern daughter and her younger mother does a great job. (The English subtitles are flawed, but definitely adequate.)",1371945600,5,880,4.534591194968553
8429854,5,B004I1CVV8,"This is a wonderful movie.

I am reluctant to say much, as I don't like giving spoilers, however, because of reading comments here and on another website, I have to explain my perspective.

SPOILER: At the beginning, the family was put in crisis financially because of the ""kindness"" of the father (He cosigned a loan for a friend.  The friend died soon after, and left the debt with the father and thus the family.) Later, the daughter mentions something about someone possibly being ""too kind"", implying it may be a bad thing. The mother reacts very negatively.  Much later, the mother, who is angry all of the time when we see her in the present, laments how her her husband has had to see her only be angry at this time when he is dying.  That is one more thing she is angry about.  There are some questions left unanswered, but those answers aren't important.  The focus is on this family.  The daughter benefits greatly from the experience she had, and her perspective is so immensely changed that she does not forsake marriage and she does not pass on the anger to her own child.

The acting is amazing, the storyline unusual, and I give this film HIGH PRAISE!",1514764800,,1167,4.545454545454546
8429855,3,B004I1CVV8,"It was good but compared to other movies it really lacked.
I feel the movie would have been a lot better if some things were better explained. The movie jumps time a lot but it is not made clear when there is a time jump. If a movie wants to do flash backs and leaps in time they really need to let the audience know when that is happening if not everything is just confusing.

I think the acting was pretty good the story it self was good to but the execution of the movie was not that great to me. Because of the confusion I had starting from the beginning the ending was hard to accept but only in the last few minutes did anything really make sense.
So it was ok, not terrible, not great",1512086400,,691,4.043795620437956
8429856,5,B004I1CVV8,"even if you are not a mermaid surely love of family, siblings & self has some importance in your life. very well done story. subtitles could be better. but the scenery and plot line is beautiful. love is beautiful in any language and that is easy to see in this film. love of culture is obvious and a delight to see.",1509840000,,316,4.19672131147541
