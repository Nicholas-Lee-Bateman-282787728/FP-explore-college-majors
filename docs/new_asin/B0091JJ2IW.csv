8534183,2,B0091JJ2IW,"I'm not sure why I gave this 2 stars. it was pretty terrible. The so-called star, Clint Dowdell as the vampire is really bad. The rest of the cast is equally to blame for this debacle. Vampires are everywhere and an annoying group of humans wind up in some house in the middle of nowhere, there to find a vampire who suggests if you protect me during the day, I will save you from the horrors of the night. The only horror is this movie. Did not care about any of these whining creatures. Drag the vampire into the daylight and just serve the rest of the cast as a smorgas bord.",1396310400,,578,4.169642857142857
8534184,4,B0091JJ2IW,The vampire issue comes out of no where in Melbourne and is spread by another bloodsucker...the mosquito.  The idea of a caretaker is pretty good as long as one of them isn't crazy with a maniquin in his bedroom.  The action and acting are each pretty well done as well as what few special effects they have.,1369526400,,308,4.385964912280702
8534185,4,B0091JJ2IW,"In a culture filled with sparkling vampires and teen-angst-romance-ridden vamp literature, it's nice to see that horror fans can still find solace in new and unique vampire films.  When I first heard about THE CARETAKER and how dark it was, I thought to myself, ""Now there's a vamp film that I need to check out!""  The fine folks at MVD Visual sent me a copy to review, and I'm proud to announce that they have a sure-fire hit on their hands.  THE CARETAKER is an excellent addition to the vampire genre, and it's one that horror fans should snatch up quickly.

THE CARETAKER is a bold and visionary film that gives us a gritty, realistic look at how an epidemic could possibly overtake society.  This realism is one aspect that makes the film so appealing, and I am particularly impressed with how filmmaker Tom Conyers manages to pull it off.  What starts off as mild concern amongst the population turns into full blown panic as the vampire virus starts affecting more and more people.

I wish I knew what the budget was for this film, however IMDB.com does not list an estimation.  It is shot well (although some of the lighting could have been better) and the production value looks fairly high.  The acting is good overall and, thankfully, there are no stereotypical or hammed-up characters.

The special effects in THE CARETAKER are also well done and look great onscreen.  I don't recall any majorly gory parts, although there's plenty of bloodshed when the epidemic first sets in and people are attacking/eating other people.  These scenes are also some of the most intense...it's truly chilling to see what society can be reduced to in the event of a catastrophe.

My sole complaint about the film is that some of the scenes are a bit too dark for my tastes.  But that is the only negative aspect I can find.  THE CARETAKER is entertaining, scary, and fun, just like a horror movie should be.

I highly recommend THE CARETAKER and suggest it for anyone that is tired of hearing about teens that fall in love with wannabe fangers.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1359936000,,2086,4.640326975476839
