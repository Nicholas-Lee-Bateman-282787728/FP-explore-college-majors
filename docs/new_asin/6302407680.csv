7825078,5,6302407680,"This is a very good 1986 work out video with some ski specific exercises.  I'm not going to stop going to the gym and ditch strength/weight training.  I get a better cardio work out on the elliptical or bike.  But this is a great video to do at home (if you like working out to videos).  If you hate working out to videos made in the mid 80's... well, this might not be the video for you.

I found the video easy to follow.  And in less than an hour, she hits the upper body, abs and lower body, plus some cardio, plus some stretching.  (Her ab exercises bother my neck and I prefer the core exercises at MayoClinic.com (search Core Strength).  I dislocated my kneecap in 2005 (skiing...), and don't find her exercises bother my knee... but I've but a lot of effort into strengthening that leg.

If working out to videos with perfect, Olympic athlete caliber bodies gives you a complex... this probably isn't the video for you.  No ""real"" bodies or rolls of fat in this video.  Suzy has a KILLER body... but I don't think that working out to this video alone will give you her body.  My 15 YO son hated the music (""It's sooooo 80's!"")... but hung around and watched the video for a while (I assume that he was interested in watching her in a skin tight body suit).  Since, I was 28 in 1986... I don't find the music awful.  It is your basic 80's work out video music.  My husband didn't comment on the music... but did comment, ""Wow.  She is pole thin.""  I'd have to be delusional to think that I'll ever have that body.  But it is a good work out.

And unlike some video leaders, I don't find her too annoying.

Considering the many expenses of skiing... I think that this video is worth the price I paid... about $4-5 plus shipping. :)",1203120000,,1737,4.286153846153846

No doubt, this year, not only will I not be the fatest chic on skiis, but will be one of the strongest thanks to this tape.",1124064000,,285,4.2407407407407405
