8172476,1,B000MUQCSC,"Why can't sellers tell me what all comes with the merchandise sets they want to sell me?

List the DVDs in the merchandise and pull the descriptions on the individual DVDs so I know what is being sold. Here's a news flash - they can have from 1 to as many as 7 DVDs each and there's no standardized contents for the sets. Not as far as I can see anyway. Core Rhythms doesn't seem to have a list of the products that I can consult.

I would really like to buy some of these products but I don't want to purchase duplicate DVDs.

Please, list the contents of the sets and what each DVD does.",1277164800,,589,4.060344827586207
8172477,5,B000MUQCSC,"Please disregard CTY ""ConnectToYou""'s review (that they posted on all discs, prompting me to do the same). They seem to have a problem mostly with the company, not the DVDs. I never buy direct as these kind of organizations are known to be slimy, and I recommend that you purchase from a third party as well.

I love dance workouts as they are fun and educational and therefore I will actually do them. These are the best. You MUST start with the starter kit ""kick start"" disc to learn the moves. It's a workout in itself! Then you can progress to the extremely challenging dance workouts. The girls do go very fast and don't give you a lot of verbal cues, but you have more visual assist (in the camera views) than you could ever need. You WILL feel a change in your body from doing these regularly! I can't say enough about them, BUY THEM ALL!",1216166400,7,845,4.382165605095541
8172478,1,B000MUQCSC,"I thought the intro package was great, but it went downhill from there. The intro package has a long and short workout. The rest of the videos have only the long workout. In total I have 5 of these videos. They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive. DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE! It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected. I sent back a duplicate product but they never did give me credit for it. Kept me on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time too when I had to call; and I had to call at least 8 times!  BUY USED only!",1187568000,2,602,4.016666666666667
8172479,5,B000MUQCSC,"If you like to dance and shake your thing.  You will love this video.  You do not need a lot of space either.  This video works more than just your core.  There is squatting throughout to work your upper legs and glutes! I have done the video three times now and I can't wait until my next work out.  I don't see myself getting bored any time soon!  The moves are sexy too!  You can take some of the moves to the club!
