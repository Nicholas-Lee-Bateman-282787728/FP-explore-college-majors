7322317,3,B0112HPWWK,"The cast listed is wrong, Danny Trejo does not appear in this movie.

The movies is basically okay. It's something I'd see on the SyFy channel on cable TV. It's obviously B-Budget, but at least the actors can act, if not great certainly sufficiently to be professional. The writing is okay, though one big flaw was in the opening scene with the two young women talking to each other. The story was just then being set up, and it became clear the two women were friends. One woman mentions something about her mothers job, but was describing it in a way that was meant to inform the audience and that being friends they would both already know. So, the way she spoke in that instance was not believable. The production quality was not top Hollywood budget, but they did spend money on it. Perhaps the producers started running low on funds when the time came to get the environmental suit props. The ""pressure suits"", or environmental suits, were made up of cobbling together spandex body suits and plastic chest protectors as used in dirt bike racing or paint-ball. Maybe they blew the budget on the rental of a power-generating station in the real world where on the overhead hoist system there's a Star Spangled Banner, a US flag, hanging from the gantry. Mind you, the scene was set in the future on Mars in what was presumably a multinational colony that was not built by any individual Earth government.

All in all, I'd have to say the film was good enough to watch all the way through, but not really good enough to recommend. If you choose to watch it you probably won't hate it, but you might not love it either.",1475280000,,1621,4.5479452054794525

But it had a pretty good casting of""no name""Actors That played there character roles realisticly,I thought that being the special effects weren't The worst! If the filmused more $ for special effects,it would've cut into the movie set $,&wouldve made it more,Cheezy! IMHOhich is Also why I feel the  Actors made up a big difference in making up the difference. Plus the Actors made the film for me,more enjoyable to watch(given the things lacking)they seemed to""work w/what they have"",&much like you'd do when reading,they'd helped my minds imagination,connect Even More-So w/the movies story line!!...So yeah,I do recommend this as a movie to try watching(Plus if like myself watching it just now,&having Amazon Prime Membership,it won't cost you rental fee to watch it!!!..
  Although I've a couple things that seemed off for a movie set in the future,on another planet-Mars,in an attempt to save the human race since Earth became uninhabitably or openly safe. In the movie its said by the charaters in scenes discussing how the Money/Budget is being used. With the story/plot is they're trying to save Mankind w/working together,you would think it'd also mean that money would no longer be a worry/issue,VS. priorities,&to help keeping eachother alive,right?...LBut like I said before,I do recommend you give it a try w/watching it!!",1469836800,,1494,5.4034334763948495

These are ultra low budget direct-to-DVD films completed in impossibly fast timeframes. And of late there have been some half-decent efforts from the company. Unfortunately this isn't one of them. It's another example of a terrific idea being butchered due to lack of funds and worse, lack of care. There is really almost no story and although the production runs for only 82 minutes it seems to be far too long as it has very little to say. The acting is wobbly and the script is appalling with far too may talkey scenes where the characters really say nothing. On the plus side, the effects from The Asylum are getting better - assumedly due to leaps forward in technology and the associated reduction in the cost of creating digital effects. There is a laudable attempt made to legitimise a lesbian relationship but unfortunately it backfires as it just comes across as creepy. The DVD comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack which occasionally makes fair use of the surround channels but really it's nothing special. This is basic viewing only and will probably disappoint even dedicated Asylum fans. Oh, and the lack of care - read the back cover. It says about people from Earth living on Mars 'Despite bringing them closer than ever to the sun'... Hey, isn't Mars further away from the sun than earth is?",1457049600,,1424,4.769230769230769

Set on Mars, Martian Land is a low budget film but does have an interesting premise. Mars is being terraformed, and the causes a huge sand and electrical storm which threatens domed cities.

Special effects are OK. Some vehicles which look decent, and some scenery which is OK. The sand storm is only adequate.

Acting is average. There is a sub plot about a father and daughter who are estranged.

Costumes are poor. The security uniforms are t-shirts with masking tape applied. Environmental suits are sort of OK, except again, colored masking tape was used to put stripes on the helmets, and in some places the tape is already lifting off.

Not much for soundtrack.

Overall I give this a C rating. Not terrible, but not great.",1455580800,,792,4.702898550724638

7322567,2,B0112HPWWK,"One must first understand that this is an 'ASYLUM' movie production.  The story line is not unbelievable, but with the typical environmental messaging that man has destroyed Earth's environment forcing migration to Mars.  A sudden and deadly storm on Mars is some how believed to be the result of the same negligence by man.  One should understand that the atmosphere on Mars is so very thin, that such a thick and powerful storm fraught with destruction is impossible.  The special effects are mediocre.

The acting is juvenile and phony.  There is for some reason a brief lesbian kissing scene which anyone could see coming, but had no value at all to either the plot or the characters.

The back drops and scenery are typical of the low-tech, low-budget of ASYLUM productions. In this movie a massive amount of plastic loading pallets where used as walls, flooring, and hatch doors along with rolls and rolls of LED light rope.  Space or environmental suits were obvious surfing wet suits with painted welding helmets.

There is an audience for this 'B' or lower level type of science fiction.  I watch it, but it is sad to see such ridiculousness out there.",1450137600,7,1161,4.818181818181818

7322572,2,B0112HPWWK,"This is an Asylum mock buster and follows the standard Asylum disaster film formula used successfully for over a decade. If you are not familiar with it, this will contain PLOT SPOILERS. In fact I include the ending.

Having screwed up the Earth due to global warming...or not, the planet's population has been transported to Mars where they live in domed cities connected by underground caverns. On Mars, a giant dust storm erupts that can destroy the domes that was caused by man made heating of the planet...or not. Only one man Foster (Lane Townsend) can save the planet using EMFs to stop the storm. Now I have no idea how EMFs can stop a sand storm, not even as junk science, but hey it is Asylum.

The Asylum disaster formula has a divided family with dad attempting to save the kids while saving the planet. In this case, dad hasn't seen his daughter in 20 years and she prefers the company of other women to men which is something new for Asylum. There is a step dad in the picture and according to the formula [PLOT SPOILER] he has to die. In this case the step-dad is not a bad guy as in some films.

Now I am not going to tell you if the biological family is reunited and the world is saved. That might really spoil things.

Typical Asylum special effects and non-existing acting. I don't recall seeing Danny Trejo in this film.

7322592,3,B0112HPWWK,"This is one of the latest efforts coming straight out of Asylum Studios this year and this either going to be a hit or a miss with some people. However, the only thing that saved this movie are the special effects. If you take this movie and compare it to Mega Shark vs. Kolossus (one of Asylum's current releases this year), it's night and day to be honest with you. I'm not saying that you're going to get Star Wars like quality here, but it's a better attempt by the special effects department. I think that the fact that most of the story was filmed out in the desert and since it's a Sci-Fi film, they had a lot of leeway with the special effects and could stretch it out the best that they could. Anyway, the story for Martian Land was ok. At least I was able to stay awake through out the whole movie. Sure, there was some action. The acting was ok but like I said, the only thing that kept this movie from sinking all the way to the bottom of the lake was the special effects and coming from Asylum, it's really good!!! Not bad to watch on a rainy day but if you're into the Sci-Fi thing then check this out.
