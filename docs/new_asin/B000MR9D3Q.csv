8196023,5,B000MR9D3Q,"Silverwing is amazing! I know there are a LOT of people who complained that it took too many liberties from the books and such, but that's always going to be the case for animated adaptations, let alone for movies and such. I enjoyed it back when it aired, and I still enjoy it today. Shame there wasn't a more in depth and accurate translation from the series, because more seasons with more and closer adaptations would've been cool, but for me I think people should do as I do; love the series for what it is. It's well animated, has good and solid voice acting (Goth, Shade, Freida, etc), and an easy enough story for a TV animation. The commitment and willingness to feature (usually not visible) animals ending other animals is also a big thing for an animation for TV. They weren't afraid to push the lines of the nature of the beast. Er... literally.

Bottom line? Yeah, it's not the books, but it's still awesome for what it is, and I love it.",1453852800,,952,4.44

8196025,5,B000MR9D3Q,"When I little, they had this show on Disney Channel and I got up early every morning to record it before going to school. I was so excited to have finally found this show after searching for it for a long time. This is an excellent retelling of the book by Kenneth Oppel. Very rarely do you see T.V. shows or movies that are based on books that matches  almost exactly everything to the book. I will say that as much as I loved the book and will probably re-read it in the future, the show was better. I would definitely recommend it to those who love this type of animation cartoons and they should check it out for their own viewing pleasure.",1376784000,4,644,4.235772357723577
8196026,4,B000MR9D3Q,"Not a lot of people remember this series and thats a shame. It was on TV a few years ago my younger sister and I really got into it. It has a different plot than other shows out at the time. It centers around bats. The story line is, before the laws of nature the birds and the beasts raged war for control. The bats chose not to choose sides. Therefore, after the war they were banished to only fly at night, never to see the sun again. That is until Shade Silverwing did on a dare. From there many unexpected events occur. Cannibal bats, taken by humans for study escape and start killing birds, and the owl's leader, Brutus, is in charge of keeping the law and declares war on the Silverwings, thinking they have decided to go rouge. Shade knows the truth, but Brutus refuses to believe a law breaker and it turns into a race to uncover the truth and stop the pending massacre.",1349136000,2,880,4.275449101796407
8196027,5,B000MR9D3Q,Silverwing - Season 1 - This is an excellent cartoon and animation series.  The storyline is spot on with the audiobook and reading books.  The characters are engaging.  The story is adventurous. We really enjoyed this series. Thank you.,1313539200,2,237,5.0256410256410255
8196028,5,B000MR9D3Q,"The story is perfect, the animation is gorgeous and characters true to the book. I love this boxed set, Goth and Throb's voices are great too. And the ending theme song is spectacular, wish I could find it as an mp3. Great job!",1265068800,2,227,4.3023255813953485
8196029,5,B000MR9D3Q,"I applaud the makers of this show.  Expertly crafted, based on a brilliant book, and best of all it doesn't go out of its way to be a ""children's show"".  The characters are complex and given what they're routinely put through every episode, you really feel for them throughout the series.  Even an adult like me found Silverwing to be extremely enjoyable.  The animation is great, the music is spectacular (especially for a cartoon), and the chase sequences (of which there are plenty) are truly thrilling.  It does have quite a few dark moments, but they don't dominate the show; they actually make the high points that much more rewarding, and that's something I feel is sorely lacking in a lot of cartoons out there.  It reminds me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonic-The-Hedgehog-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000M8N41W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;in that regard.
It follows its source material pretty well; much of what's found in the book is seen in the series, but the series takes it further by adding more to the story.  Here we see what goes on among other characters besides Shade and Marina; we see how the rest of the Silverwing colony braves the long journey to Hibernaculum, as well as how Goth and Throbb have been affecting the rest of the animal kingdom, and there are some good side-stories woven in there.
I do think it's a shame the series didn't return for a second season, but there's some good closure to the show and I'm glad it got to make its run on TV.
Highly recommended.",1241740800,3,1597,5.095785440613027
8196030,5,B000MR9D3Q,"I remember this series when it was shown on TOONDisney.  Based on the novel by K Oppel, this mini-series is very true to its source material.  The animation is excelent -- almost anime quality.  And the characters well portrayed.  I'm only disaponted in the fact that they didn't adapt the sequel novels.",1213574400,3,304,4.788461538461538
8196031,4,B000MR9D3Q,"This animated series is based on the first book in the Silverwing Saga.
The animators have done lots of changes of the story, but there are still many elements from the book. I liked the character designs.
The book is of course better, but this series is very interesting and fun to watch.",1193097600,8,289,4.471698113207547
