2842649,3,B000QUU4MI,Nothing wrong with the movie.  But it took a really long time to arrive from a not so good Amazon partner.,1264550400,,106,4.0476190476190474
2842650,5,B000QUU4MI,"First is Gross Point Blank.  Nothing more attractive than a man that can kick ass whilst being a tortured soul....what could possibly be more appealing?  (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine..  possibly).  Anyway, very funny, dark, and, of course, the 80s references that I, oh ma gah, love.
High Fidelity is one of my favorite movies (the book is great too).  I think, Jack Black's best performance.  And the movie touches on some of my own themes, music and critical snobbery without actually having talent yourself.  Again, very funny and relative. You can watch them over and over...I do.",1255219200,9,582,4.938144329896907

2842652,5,B000QUU4MI,"This IS widescreen, not the sloppy pan & scan. Especially with High Fidelity I would think you'd want to see everything the excellent director, Stephen Frears puts on the screen - a WIDE SCREEN. Also, High Fidelity is enhanced for 16x9 TVs.

The transfer is not 100% (the print used for Grosse Pointe Blank looks a touch worn - ocassional scratches), but the single version DVDs are none better.

This is a real bargain and a great double feature.",1205884800,18,447,4.6455696202531644

2842749,5,B000QUU4MI,"Grosse Point Blank-This quirky film was fabulous. I loved the dark humor throughout the movie and John Cusack is at his finest, along with Minnie Driver and Dan Akyrod.
High Fidelity-I was told by a guy friend that it's exactly how me think. The movie was off beat and funny. Jack Black is a hoot. Tim Robbins has me laughing with his hippie ponytail. John Cusack-spot on as usual. The DVD's were new.",1400198400,,401,4.506849315068493

2842794,4,B000QUU4MI,"I recently purchased this two-movies-in-one-package deal because I can't believe how inexpensive DVDs are becoming in the age of instant digital media (right now, not ALL movies are available on demand so I'd rather purchase these two inexpensive flicks for one low price). It's amazing. I'm not much a collector of movies but I do own some flicks that I love watching time and again.

My biggest concern was whether these two movies on DVD were true Widescreen and would play correctly on my TV. Many of the reviews here reviewed the movie but not much on the product, that is the DVD itself. High Fidelity worked great on my 1080P HD TV. No problem there. However, the Grosse Point Blank DVD, I had to select a different picture size on the television in order for it to play ""normally"" that is the image isn't stretched out one way or another. If I played the Grosse Point Blank DVD on an analog TV I think it would play just fine and appear like a true widescreen/letterbox format. I've had this problem before with some of my exercise DVDs.

For me it's no big deal, even though I wish I didn't have to change the settings on my TV. Aside from this little hiccup, the picture quality is great, the sound is great, the discs were spotless, service was excellent. I don't know what else to say except that High Fidelity plays great on modern HDTVs and Grosse Point Blank didn't quite exactly. It is widescreen but you see that on an analog TV, if this makes any sense.",1363219200,5,1471,4.485074626865671

2842799,5,B000QUU4MI,"An excellent pairing of Grosse Pointe Blank and High Fidelity. Both films have John Cusack as a self-made entrepreneur - professional killer in GPB and indy record store owner in HF. He struggles with love and morality in both films and in the end, works through his inner conflicts and gets the girl.

A highly recommended DVD",1333065600,,327,4.7368421052631575

2842801,3,B000QUU4MI,"I liked this movie, although I think it was very much to the period (I watched this movie in July 2011 in my early 20's.  The movie came out in 1997).  A lot of the conventions and humor did not resonate as well with me as I had hoped.  I loved the story and am a Huge Piven fan.  I thought he was used well.  I also thought Cusack was  good pick for the role.  The genre is weird...it is like a drama-comedy, much more common today I feel.

I did think the movie needed some cutting.  It was a bit long, but I liked the overall idea.  I think with some cutting, some rewrites and reshotting today the movie could be a monster comedy hit.(which I may chalk up the movie not playing as well years after it came out as the genre has been developed more)

In the end, if you a movie person I would recommend it.  This Original Idea is refreshing amongst an movie scene of mostly stupid or unoriginal ideas.  A remake of this movie with a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers-Rated/dp/B003F6WENW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers (Rated)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anchorman-The-Legend-of-Ron-Burgundy-Blu-ray/dp/B004IK30S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy [Blu-ray</a>] or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superbad/dp/B0010R08PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superbad</a>&nbsp;feel behind it could be a monster comedic/dramatic hit in my eyes.

If you are looking for something different, like any of the cast or original stories, ideas, jokes or dialogue this movie is for you.

Packaging note:
