7971290,5,B00006L920,"This British miniseries is a hard hitting story about a poor Irish family from London. It is a study in family dysfunction amidst poverty,how this family copes and the defense mechanisms that they employ just to survive. Jason Issacs as Michael is a joy to watch. The almost four hours just flies so fast,that like me,you will find that you will want to watch it over and over again.",1346889600,,383,4.565217391304348
7971291,3,B00006L920,"As I am very fond of Jason Isaacs' portrayal of luscious Lucius Malfoy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000W746GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)</a>, thought I would check out a rare lead performance for him in this television adaptation of the best selling novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Lady/dp/0747206147/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Lady</a>&nbsp;which illustrates the rise of an impoverished East End London crime family, The Ryans.  The ""Dangerous Lady"" in question is Maura Ryan (portrayed by an excellent Susan Lynch), the youngest and only female sibling who evolves from victim to villainess. Isaacs portrays the psychopathic elder brother, Michael Ryan, whose character is loosely based on the real life exploits of the notorious schizophrenic gay gangsters Ronnie Kray and his twin brother.

Michael's character does evoke some of Lucius' ""best"" qualities-menacing but devoted to family, ruthlessly striving to elevate himself and his kin, and similar to a DeathEater, he is an icy-hearted killer. The handsome, dark haired and big eyed Isaacs and Ms. Lynch do have a strong familial resemblance and there a real chemistry between them!

Sadly, this graphically violent, four-part mini-series failed to engage this viewer even though it boasts a great cast and the set design and period costumes capture the real-life drabness of the 1960s era London very well. I think that the original story is probably too lengthy and complex and probably should have focused on a shorter time period.  The screenplay doesn't offer enough of a back story to make the characters sympathetic except for a young Michael turning tricks with an older ganglord to support the family.

Isaacs did manage to steal this viewer's sympathies (ah, that thieving boy!) in his usual way by taking a horrific villain and proceeding to make him the most fully realized character in the story. Plus, his gorgeous Michael Ryan is one hot dude when he gets mad or sleeps in the buff on satin sheets!",1293148800,,2205,5.987301587301587
7971292,5,B00006L920,"This gritty drama won't be to everyone's taste, but I recommend it for the great performances and interesting story.  It's not what I expected as far as the plot or the characters.  I wasn't expecting much since it was made for TV about 12 years ago, but was surprised to be drawn in very quickly to the story and characters.  As usual for him, Jason Isaacs is able to take a very amoral, unpleasant character and make him sympathetic and repellent at the same time; he's amazing, as are the actresses who play his mother and sister (sorry, I don't have their names in front of me or I would give them; they both are wonderful).  I highly recommend this series (4 episodes) for its honesty and realism.  It's painful to watch at times but well worth your time.  Be aware it's NOT for kids or those who are easily offended by a very adult, honest story.  Nothing is sugar-coated here!  But I really enjoyed it and plan to watch it many times.  Also, as I think another reviewer mentioned, the accents take some getting used to for us Americans.  I have watched it a few times to try to get more of the dialogue.",1200960000,,1110,4.3707317073170735
7971293,5,B00006L920,"Great acting, a compelling storyline and well-rounded characters make this one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. I don't usually like gangster movies, but this is definitely an exception. Many scenes in Dangerous Lady stayed with me long after the movie ended. Several characters, Michael in particular, struck at the heart. Many of these characters are more than what they seem. Notable performances by Susan Lynch, Owen Teele, and Jason Isaacs. Excellent all around.",1159833600,,479,5.315789473684211
7971294,5,B00006L920,"I really enjoyed this movie!

Loved Jason Isaacs and Susan Lynch.

Definately worth seeing.",1159833600,,91,5.428571428571429
7971295,5,B00006L920,"I stayed up until 2 a.m. last night watching this mini-series, because Jason Isaac's performance as Michael Ryan, an ambitious, violent thug who has been the primary caretaker of his large family since he was a child, is so mesmirizing that I simply could not stop watching.  Although the performances of the whole cast range between very good and outstanding, my favorite scenes were all about Michael's relationship with his mother.  I loved every single scene between them, even the most painful and contentious of their encounters. Michael is so strong, so resolute, so self-sufficient and self-confident, and yet his mother still has the power to undo him completely. An Irish mother is a powerful being, a living Madonna, and an Irish son can never completely escape his desire for her good regard and affection.  When Mrs. Ryan finally turns Michael out of her house, the disbelief and despair on his face is simply heartbreaking.

Susan Lynch is wonderful as Maura, and I think the mini-series was supposed to be primarily her story, as opposed to her brother's, but Jason's performance of Michael is too powerful.  It is the showpiece role of the production, and it prompts me to ask this question:  Why the hell isn't Jason Isaacs a bigger star?

I highly, highly recommend this one, even though the DVD doesn't include much in the way of extras.",1148083200,14,1356,4.895196506550218
7971296,5,B00006L920,"I really wasn't sure what to expect from this mini-series.  I'm not a big fan of British television but I had heard good things about this so I watched it.  I'm glad I did.

The acting was first-rate.  Susan Lynch (as Moara) was very good - as was everyone in the cast.  Jason Isaacs (as Michael) was truly outstanding - his portrayal as a 'violent perverted bender' was chilling (but also sympathetic).  I've never seen an actor that can convey more emotions with tiny changes in his expression.  His scenes with 'Joe-the-fish' were exceptional.

This movie is well worth watching more than once.  I'll be honest - the accents threw me a bit and I had to watch it several times to catch all the words.  But that's not a fault of the film - it made it more authentic.

All in all, a great movie.  And a must-have for any Jason Isaacs' fan.",1137456000,8,839,4.376623376623376
7971297,4,B00006L920,"While never quite overcoming its origins as a British television miniseries, this movie is nevertheless an absorbing, satisfying crime drama featuring unusually strong performances, especially from leads Susan Lynch and the always mesmerizing Jason Isaacs.
  Both convey their reluctance to yield completely to the life of crime that seems to have chosen them; it costs Maura her one true love, and Mickey any chance of self-determinism at all.  Mickey commences his career as the youthful lover of an older boss, whom he regards with contempt and disgust.
  While never excusing or romanticizing their actions, the story presents the Ryans as unusually fully realized individuals, and even at their most sociopathic, they are never entirely repellent.
  As British productions in general seem to do, this one also projects extreme realism in the gritty environment and tacky costumes.  The accents may prove somewhat challenging to Americans for the first few minutes, since those seem completely authentic as well.",1046736000,10,1016,5.467948717948718
