7880967,2,6304967209,"""Devil Hunters"" is a fairly unexceptional and uninvolving cops & gangsters flick from Hong Kong, notable only for featuring a pretty horrifying stunt gone wrong. The stunt in question has actually been cut out of some international versions of the feature, but at the risk of sounding sadistic, you probably should hunt down an uncensored copy of the film if you really want to see it, if only because the rest of the action scenes are likely to remain unedited as well in such versions. You'll need every second of the action, after all, to make it through this otherwise dark and boring action feature.

The story: a gangster feud between two rivals (the more notable of which is played by Francis Ng of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infernal-Affairs-2/dp/B000KX0IMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infernal Affairs 2</a>) becomes the mission of a police task force.

Technically, this is a ""girls with guns"" film starring Moon Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-s-Tears/dp/B00004WM7V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer's Tears</a>) and Sibelle Hu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Lucky-Stars/dp/B0000V46DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Lucky Stars</a>), but there's equal focus given to the villainous gangster characters and their goings-on. It might just be me, but it took me forever to realize who was on whose side and what everybody's primary objectives were - never a good sign for a film if that's not apparent before it's half over. The plot is uncharacteristically dark for this kind of movie, with next to no comic relief but a good deal of tragedy and bloodletting. Again, it might just be me, but I was almost completely unable to connect with any of the characters (with the exception of that of Michael Chan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legacy-of-Rage/dp/B0007IO6Y6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legacy of Rage</a>), so I cared little about their often depressing fates.

There's a fair amount of action to see, but you'll have to wait until the second half of the picture to get to the good stuff. It's split fairly evening between fistfights and gunfights, with a few vehicle chase scenes thrown in - including a massive but boring car & speedboat chase - but the only satisfying offerings are a big John Woo-style gunfight featuring the aforementioned Michael Man and the finale when Sibelle, Moon, and Ray Lui (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Point/dp/B00125WAUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Point</a>) attack the gangsters and get to fight both Francis Ng and Ken Lo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Drunken-Master/dp/B004U7MR1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Drunken Master</a>) in two brawls. This is followed by the aforementioned stunt, wherein Hu and Lee are seen visibly engulfed by flames while attempting to evade an explosion. Both recovered to make many more films, but it's a shame that the stunt leads to a real downer of an ending, befitting the previous tone of the movie. I hate to say so, but I could've really used some of that Peking Opera-style humor in this one.

Not much more to say about this one other than that I don't know who to recommend it to: its advertised stars aren't really featured prominently enough to make it worth buying for their sake, and neither the story nor the action is worth the price of purchase.

7880968,2,6304967209,"DEVIL HUNTERS (1989) is a convoluted Hong Kong crime thriller with enough kung fu, shootouts, explosions and gratuitous sadism to keep most jaded HK action fans satisfied. It deals with the efforts of a host of characters to bring down a Hong Kong drug lord. Not only are the cops after him, but so are a bunch of other people with grudges, including Abby, a mysterious kung fu-fighting young woman (Moon Lee). The drug boss's own lieutenant, Shing, played in wonderfully snaky fashion by popular HK villain Francis Ng, is also out to topple him. The poor man hasn't got a friend in the world until Abby hides him from the others and outlines her demands. But then Shing gets into the act and paves the way for a massive final confrontation involving all concerned parties. In addition to Moon Lee and Francis Ng, other familiar players in the large cast include another fighting femme, Sibelle Hu (HARD TO DIE, CHINA HEAT), Ken Lo (DRUNKEN MASTER II), and Raymond Lui (LORD OF THE EAST CHINA SEA).
The film is notorious for its final stunt, in which the stunt players for the three leads are caught in a premature explosion and catch fire just as they leap out of the building. The film exploits this accident by replaying it at the very end in slow motion, telling us what happened and including a closing sentiment wishing the injured parties a speedy recovery!",990921600,,1364,4.66390041493776
