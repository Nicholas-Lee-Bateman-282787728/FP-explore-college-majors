4667195,2,B0049OFJSQ,"I don't want to spoil what there is of a plot.

The movie involves a number of individuals going through situations, that vaguely relate.

I guess what I can say is that Thor doesn't instill the respect a son of Odin would normally receive.",1378771200,,240,4.431818181818182
4667196,4,B0049OFJSQ,"It would be redundant, I'm sure, to call 2009's ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" a quirky, little, low-budget independent film. I mean, ""quirky,"" ""little,"" and ""low-budget"" practically define independent productions, and this one certainly qualifies on all counts, an odd duck that combines a little comedy, parody, and pathos into a fantasy about the Norse god Thor wandering the suburbs of Las Vegas. No, it's not the Chris Hemsworth Thor; this one is the Jerry Thompson Thor, Thompson having co-starred in, co-written, and co-directed the project with his brother Mike. It's their first full-length feature.

As one might expect of a low-budget effort, the movie doesn't look as polished as a big studio production and doesn't benefit from many experienced actors. That's part of its charm, of course. With the exception of Thor, for instance, the players seem to be wearing mainly their everyday clothes. Moreover, the Thompsons appear to have shot the film in and around the same few neighborhoods on the outskirts of Las Vegas, and the homes easily substitute for any housing tracts in America. So, it all works out pretty well in its Everyman, everywhere, sort of symbolic approach.

Anyway, while some of its humor falls flat, ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" is mostly amusing in its own deadpan manner, the assorted skits lazily weaving their humorous courses into and through one another. I didn't find any huge, laugh-out-loud gags in the film, just a succession of gently comical moments. In fact, the film's convoluted narrative style may remind viewers of ""Pulp Fiction,"" with some of the laid-back whimsy of ""The Big Lebowski"" thrown in. In the case of the latter, the Thompson brothers may be experiencing a bit of Coen envy, and that's not a bad thing.

I don't think you're going to mistake ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" for a major Oscar winner, yet if you're like me, you may find the longer you watch it, the more you'll like it. You've just got a sweet, humorous, poignant little film here. For a first-time feature-length effort, it's not bad.

Let me also add that there is nothing about ""Thor"" that is offensive, crude, or gross. Unlike most of Hollywood's big-screen comedies anymore, ""Thor"" contains no profanity, no nudity, no sex, and virtually no violence. It's kind of refreshing, actually.",1369526400,3,2295,4.953246753246753
4667197,5,B0049OFJSQ,This movie made me feel good. Thats the main thing I want from a movie and I got it with Thor at the Bus Stop.,1363737600,2,110,3.44
4667198,5,B0049OFJSQ,"I am so glad I bought this movie. It is very funny and original. Soundtrack is very good too! The actors are wonderful and cast perfectly. Low budget but doesn't hurt the movie at all. I really, really like this movie. I totally recommend it.",1354060800,2,242,4.4
4667199,1,B0049OFJSQ,"I was sadly subjected to a view of ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" this weekend and must say that the film is only remarkable in that it has the ability to completely stop the passage of time for the poor souls who are forced to watch it.

The dialogue is ludicrous, the camera-work is the very ""best"" that a student film shot with a camcorder held by a person with a nervous twitch has to offer, and the plot so meandering and pedantic that the script must have been penned by an overly-caffeinated chimpanzee with ADD.

This is the worst type of indie film-- one that is full of pretentious monologues by ""overly clever"" characters on the meaning of life and the complexity of existence.  The entire premise of the film comes down to two words: ""be cool.""

Seriously-- avoid this film at ALL costs!  You can NEVER get the time spent viewing it back again.",1349049600,,848,4.410256410256411
4667200,5,B0049OFJSQ,"Big names. Tons of special effects. Epic proportions. That's what I'd expect to see in the 2011 movie ""Thor.""

I'd also expect to be able to figure out the plot within the first 15 minutes. Maybe I'll catch ""Thor"" on TV someday, but I'll pass on the theater.

Instead, I recently shelled out $22 to buy a quirky, low-budget independent film called ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" made in 2009 by brothers Jerry Thompson (as ""Thor"") and Mike Thompson (as ""White Trash Chuck""). It has no mind-bending CGI or Oscar-winning actors (its only recognizable star is magician Teller, in a rare on-camera speaking role, who is handcuffed in a police car completely forgotten by the arresting officer).

Yet what is endearing about ""Thor at the Bus Stop"" is that I never knew exactly how it would end, its gentle satire kept me chuckling for the entire 99 minutes, the background music was catchy, and I cared about what happened to all the characters, even the ones who started out presumably evil. Its message is simple, as stated by a reformed carjacker: ""You only have two choices: Be cool or not.""

The basic plot is that Thor is moping around the suburbs of Las Vegas because the possible end of the world, Ragnarok, has finally arrived and he must get on a bus that takes him to the Nevada desert where he will battle the Midgard serpent. The story is less about Thor and more about the chain of reactions he creates while waiting for the bus. Thor will be saving the planet once again for a humanity that has forgotten him, he knows he will die doing it, he's not happy about it, and the occasional bystander suffers for it.

I'm sure that the release of the new movie ""Thor"" will introduce a lot of people to Norse mythology. Everyone will be dressing up like Thor this Halloween: long blond hair, giant hammers, and helmets with horns on top. But if you happen to see Thor at a bus stop, remember to give him a flower and thank him for saving the planet...and whatever you do, don't let Teller out of that police car even if he does quote Shakespeare to you.",1307404800,9,2048,4.494623655913978

8468976,4,B0049OFJSQ,"Made for literally nothing starring literally no one, this film student project is one of those ""I need something completely stupid and ridiculous to take my mind off things"" kind of movie.  At the same time, it's funny, charming, and does a surprisingly good job of tying all the loose ends together.  There's good guys and bad guys, of course, but by the end, you're pretty much rooting for all of them.

There will never be a Criterion edition, but I'm glad we got it in one form or another.",1490486400,2,494,4.466666666666667
8468977,5,B0049OFJSQ,"What a pleasant surprise!  Thoughtfully done, well directed, rich with meaning and humor.  I am so happy to have stumbled across this gem of an Indy creative film.  Had a lot of laughs and enjoyed throughout.",1488067200,,208,4.722222222222222
8468978,3,B0049OFJSQ,"Several years ago a friend of mine forwarded me the trailer for THOR AT THE BUS STOP and after seeing it, I decided it was a movie I definitely wanted to see. The trailer looked so funny. To begin with, THOR AT THE BUS STOP is a very low budget affair. The movie is told via PULP FICTION storytelling: there's a rather large myriad group of characters in a variety of situations with their only real connection via varying degrees of separation, is Thor. Thor finds himself waiting at the bus stop, getting on the bus, and traveling through a small city in Nevada on his way to the desert to fight the Midgard Serpent in the beginning of Ragnarok. He's off to save the world (and die in the process) and no one seems to care or even notice.

Actually, Thor's really a minor character in the movie while the other eccentric characters get the focus. There's a guy named White Trash Chuck who spent his who life trying to be cool, but never succeeding; a very polite carjacker named Walter who also has murder on his mind;  a man dressed in a bath robe who just keeps walking down the streets carrying some milk jugs;  a couple of strange police officers; some fake news reporters; and some other unusual characters.  The only ""star"" of the film is the side-kick magician Teller (of Penn and Teller) who has a speaking role as a handcuffed man in a police car.

Personally, THOR AT THE BUS STOP wasn't  the type of movie I was expecting it to be. There's some heart and humor scattered throughout. However, unlike PULP FICTION (this movie really does seem to want to be a more comical version of that movie), most of the film is disjointed and the different degrees of separation don't connect or never connect at all. In addition, a lot of the humor just isn't all that funny. Thor's really just there as a device to keep the various subplots moving forward. There's a lot more that could have been done with his character, but instead he's forced to take a backseat to all the other weird characters and situations that occur in the movie. Although there were a few moments here and there I liked, overall, the movie was a major disappointment to me. Instead of a really humorous movie that I thought it was going to be, THOR AT THE BUS STOP felt more like a tv sketch comedy show.",1441324800,,2281,4.4319809069212415
8468979,4,B0049OFJSQ,Lol wtf......WTF!!! I spent most of the movie along what the heck am I watching and then the last ten minutes it all came together and even put a little happy tear in my eye ...I'm still shaking my head but with a smile on my face...,1439078400,2,233,3.978723404255319
8468980,5,B0049OFJSQ,"I totally loved it!
Very low budget. Quirky, funny, somewhat unexpected. A good time, with some great lines. I hope they make more!",1411344000,,131,4.739130434782608
8468981,4,B0049OFJSQ,"Thor at the Bus Stop definitely exceeded my expectations, and, even though it's a low-budget (no budget?) independent film, I enjoyed it more than its far-more expensive distant cousin, Thor: Dark World.

Thor at the Bus Stop owes its success to two brothers, Jerry and Mike Thompson, who wrote, starred in, edited, and did nearly everything else in this oddly endearing film.  A third Thompson brother helped them film it, as did their film-school teacher, David Schmoeller (Puppetmaster, Tourist Trap, ), who's guidance helped steer them toward success.

In the movie, the title character, Thor, God of Thunder, is on route to Ragnark, the twilight of the Norse Gods, where he knows he is destined to die in a final battle with the Midgard Serpent.  Thor's final journey takes him through a nameless town on the edge of Las Vegas.  He must have lost his goat-drawn chariot somewhere along the way because he's just standing around waiting for the bus to take him to his last stop.  And, well, as one might expect in a world that's forgotten him, Thor's kind of depressed about it all and feeling rather unappreciated.

But the real story here is a patchwork of eccentric characters slowly moving around Thor, and the crossing and interweaving of their lives and stories.  We have the likes of White-Trash Chuck, who's spent a life trying to be cool, and failing miserably; One-Way Walter, a rather polite car jacker who nonetheless is intent upon murder; some bath-robed clad man, striding with unknown purpose, while carrying milk jugs; a girl who wants her overly laid-back boyfriend to be assertive, more of a ""jerk""; a couple of unusual police officers who buddy together; fake news reporters; and even some punks who bully small children to steal their lunch boxes.

It's all good, funny, enjoyable to watch.  Don't expect great acting, elaborate props, special effects, and so on, but also be prepared to have a fun time and to be impressed with the art that can be created by a talented pair of young film-school grads with no budget, a cast of volunteer actors, and some excellent local band music.",1400284800,,2108,4.863128491620111
8468982,5,B0049OFJSQ,"Las Vegas-based film makers Lightforge Studios are an amazingly talented bunch.

8468984,5,B0049OFJSQ,"The film's Directors took an ordinary suburban Las Vegas neighborhood and some ordinary people and made a great film.  The points on character and belief stood out.  The reviews are as quirky as the film's characters and some are uneven but overall the film satisfies for a patient watcher.

Mr. Thompson LOOKS like the God of Thunder.

A great first effort from the Thompsons.

More satisfying than many of today's; soulless multi-million dollar CGI filled crap fests.",1379462400,3,469,5.038961038961039
