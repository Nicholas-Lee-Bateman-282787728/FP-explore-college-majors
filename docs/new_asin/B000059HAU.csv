1404900,4,B000059HAU,"For a movie I never heard of(being in the theaters), this was a surprisingly decent movie.  The movie basically follows four families (a Hispanic family, Vietnamese family, African-American family and a Jewish family) as they prepare Thanksgiving dinner.  Overall, it is a nice family movie despite the obvious dysfunction in each family (which is pretty realistic I suppose).
Among the ""issues"" addressed in this movie:  lesbian relationships, marital infidelity, the generation gap between parents and children, single parent homes, and gun violence.
The ending of the movie surprisingly ties everything together into a nice bow but you still feel at the end of the movie like, ""What a wacky world we live in.""
Overall, the movie itself is a nice watch, worthy of an afternoon rental viewing.  It's definitely not a waste of money.
Among the special DVD features in this film are interviews and commentaries from cast and crew members on a WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS.  The interviews are so-so.  They're not worth the price of admission, but it's an ""okay"" bonus.  The special feature in the DVD section I really liked were the recipes for some of the delicious dishes served up in some of the families' Thanksgiving dinners.  That's a great DVD bonus.
Here's my rundown:
Great:  The recipes in the DVD special features
Good:  The overall movie itself (storyline, acting, etc).
Okay:  The DVD bonus interviews, commentaries, etc
Bad:  The pure dysfunction...but it's unfortunately all too true in our society...
Overall, a nice effort for the cast and crew and the DVD makers.

1404901,3,B000059HAU,This movie is not the best i've seen. but it is good for a rainy day. I say rent this and if you like it good if not sorry. This is kind of a chick flick just to worn.,991440000,,167,3.3076923076923075
1404902,4,B000059HAU,"What's Cooking is a film that the whole family can enjoy.  Well written, acted and directed the film tells the story of four family's of different ethnic backgrounds getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Featuring an all star cast featuring Joan Chen, Julianna Margulies, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard and A. Martinez to name a few. Written & Directed by Gurinder Chadha and produced by Jeffrey Taylor, Ethan Hurt and Steven D. Kravitz for Because Entertainment the film skillfully weaves together a story that is both interesting and entertaining.  I would highly recommend this film to anybody that enjoys the cinema but is put off by the vulgarity in so many of today's films.",988156800,9,700,5.131578947368421
1404903,5,B000059HAU,"I really enjoyed this movie. I went to see it in theaters. Hoping to get an okay movie, and leaving instead with the feeling that I had just seen a really great film that most don't know about. I especially liked how they brought all the different cultures together all for a common purpose, Thanksgiving. Sometimes we get so caught up in things, that we forget to see what's really important. That's what this film is about. And it has a good way of showing that.",986515200,,464,4.406976744186046
1404904,3,B000059HAU,"This four-stories-about-one-story movie about families airing their dirty laundry at Thanksgiving isn't likely to replace ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" as my favorite, but it's worth a look for the great cast. Of note is the always incredible Alfre Woodard; the woman never fails to move me.
My chief gripe is the way the film is edited. Just as some scenes are ready to take off, they cut to something else. Too bad they didn't hire Mike Figgis to shoot this in his ""Time Code"" quadrant style.
Still, any film that prominently features a dachshund in the cast is alright by me.",983750400,,579,4.742574257425742
1404905,5,B000059HAU,I bought this movie as a gift.  I had seen it before and loved it.  It is so funny!  The people I gave it to love it also.,1490659200,,122,3.2857142857142856
1404906,1,B000059HAU,Basically caricatures of non white people with a bit of LGBT stereotype thrown in.,1488931200,,82,4.928571428571429
1404907,4,B000059HAU,Interconnected families drama -and the families don;t realize they how closely they are connected any more than the audience does till the end.  The story unfolds so naturally you don't immediately notice some of the important parts of the multiple subplots - a good thing for those who don't tend to prefer mind candy but also don't want to work so hard to understand what is going on that they cannot enjoy the movie. One chilling aspect of the film is the wierdly prophetic feeling to the descriptions of the political figure in the character dialogue; the film came out 16 years ago.  But most of the film is an interesting exploration of the quintessential family dynamic whenever large family groups get together and both good and bad interactions occur.,1488153600,2,760,4.838461538461538
1404908,4,B000059HAU,"This brought us into the homes of Jewish (with a lesbian daughter and her significant other), Vietnamese, Latino and African American families, and all of the family drama, paired with unconditional love, that they all brought to the table.

1404963,4,B000059HAU,"With so few Thanksgiving movies, this one is a nice reminder of all the delicious food that awaits you. As far as the political family drama goes, it will make you nostalgic for simpler times when your only task was explaining what a lesbian is to your great auntie Mable before resuming your mashed potato castle. Took off a star for poor acting, but it's a nice story line.

1404968,4,B000059HAU,"Interesting assemblage of many fine actors in this old film. This all takes place around the Thanksgiving table. There are four families who live in the same neighborhood. All the families have secrets to hide.

In one family, the assistant to the mayor has his secret, his son has his secret, and the rest of the family are coping. The next family is Vietnamese and has three children. All have issues, but the family does not talk about them. The next family is very large and dealing with a father who left them while he was having an affair. He wants to move back in. The last family has a grown daughter who is gay. Her lover comes home with her, but the mother and father do not talk about it.

During the Thanksgiving meal, everything comes out, and the family must cope. Interesting times.

Thanksgiving being celebrated bin the homes of different ethnic families that showcased the problems, opinions and biases that play out in homes all across America.

1405347,1,B000059HAU,"Gurinder Chadha, Paul Mayeda Berges should hide their faces in shame.  Not in any movie ever seen has there been such a blank.  The only positive aspects are the colorful interiors - so you get to see the dcor of the homes, and the food preparation footage.  There is nothing beyond that, and that is no reason to view a film.

A long time is spent focused on the daughter who is a lesbian and who is accompanied by her lover.  This is not a new introduction to the family.  The two have been a couple for some time.  The scenes with the two are exploitive, and viewers, not knowing any better, will get off on this idiotic portrayal.  There is no way this was written and directed to be other than to titillate, and, given one commentator's note that they were ""delicious,"" that very classless goal was accomplished.  You would think that every same-sex couple is sexually obsessive.  This just isn't the case at all.  (Now don't y'all get this movie because you now think there are ""sex"" scenes.  There aren't.

So, on the one hand, you have the ""hot lesbians,"" and on the other, nothing.  Zero.  What a shame.  Several wonderful actors consented to this travesty.",1458518400,,1166,4.533653846153846

I'll stick it out for my $2 rental but honestly, I don't see this taking me on any type of culinary adventure to make my mouth water and delight my senses.  It just looks like family drama.  I'll edit this later if I'm wrong.

Good grief.

**So I'm back after finishing the movie.  A few good looking tables of food is all you'll get here. Weak on food love; heavy on  family drama.  Because we need more of *that*  in our lives and on screen, and not the therapeutic delightfulness of cooking and beauty of food.

There is no boring family in the house with dark skeletons, family secrets, revelations spring forth faster than the bird can roast over a long period of time, not to mention post preparation.

1405526,4,B000059HAU,"As an Episcopal priest, I'm always on the lookout for films which offer grist for the spiritual mill.  ""What's Cooking"" is a film which could profitably be used to open up a conversation about the angst holiday celebrations often stir up.  In the midst of brokenness, how does one find joy?  How do people overcome family estrangements in an atmosphere where everything is supposed to be perfect?  How do people negotiate different sets of traditions in ways which honor all?  If you find this film fruitful, I'd also suggest ""Pieces of April,"" which deals with many of the same issues but in an edgier way. ""What's Cooking"" would be good to show to families with middle school aged children, while ""Pieces of April"" is more appropriate for high school and older.",1260921600,2,763,4.793893129770993
1405527,4,B000059HAU,"I thought the movie did a great job of portraying Thanksgiving as more than an American holiday. Personally, I find it very interesting how the movie shows how the families are all so different, to the point where they don't even know they are neighbors, yet they are all so similar in that they are partially Americans. The differences are shown by the kinds of foods they eat apart from the turkey which makes it American and it is what makes them all similar. One thing is shows is the adaptation everyone does when they migrate here. It is a partial adaptation that can also be explained through the different foods they eat. For example the mexican family makes the turkey, but they also make tamales. It shows how they have adapted to American culture by making the turkey and celebrating thanksgiving, yet how they also have been able to hang on to their own Mexican culture. This is shown by the tamales they make. Overall I think the movie is pretty funny, it shows the usual family struggles during holidays of who is coming, what is going on in the family, putting petty grudges aside for family purposes, etc.",1259539200,,1121,4.61
1405548,5,B000059HAU,"The Thanksgiving film 'What's Cooking' uses its stacked yet unique cast to introduce the film's moral plot line and the heart-warming stories of four families living in LA. Throughout the film, the four families stories' interact with one another without knowing as they are complete strangers to the each other, despite the fact that they are all neighbors on a single street corner in an LA neighborhood. Each family is of a different descent and religion, helping the film to show the diversity of the families and how these differences are made even more apparent by the holidays. Each family in the movie shows a different kind of struggle, each that seem to be exasperated by the holidays. The struggles of the families are extremely relatable for the audience which provides the film with depth. As the movie continues, the stories of the families become more and more entangled, until the conclusion of the movie where the struggle of one of the families unintentionally involves all four families to come together and the struggles of each family to seem unimportant. 'What's Cooking?' allows a great look into different races and ethnicities, as well as a deep moral understanding of family and what is really important in your life.

1405549,3,B000059HAU,"This movie critiqued modern family and how in general we look at how thanksgiving is supposed to go within our families. Commonly things don't go as well as we would like them to. In the movie there are several families who live on the same block of different races and ethnicities and are not directly connected. They all go through things that are very uncomfortable. I think the film is showing that we need to embrace our families no matter what happens between our families. It is common for families to have tension between each other and common for silly mistakes to happen in a kitchen like burning or dropping to turkey. This was a very cleverly done movie. You get a great sense of a deeper connection that the human race holds as individuals. It shows our common bond with family and the problems that come up and often show a lot during the holidays when the family is together. It had an interesting way of showing different ethnic groups that live on the same block and probably don't think much of each other or their lives. The human race is deeply connected with each other even more then we really see or might never know. I think the movie critiqued the saying "" It's a small world.""  There were a lot of suspenseful a funny parts. It was not the best but pretty good.",1259452800,,1287,4.453389830508475

In ""What's Cooking?"", 4 different families are shown preparing a Thanksgiving meal, getting together, and learning new information about each other. The ensemble of actors depicts each home's event so realistically that you cheer for Mercedes Ruehl as she moves forward after her husband's infidelity; you hope that Alfre Woodard will accept her husband's attempt to get back together; you praise Kyra and Juliana in their decision to have a baby; and you want to knock some sense into Joan Chen to value her daughter more than she does.

The intersecting stories are dramatic, engrossing and touch on subject matter like homosexuality, interracial dating, extramarital affairs and gang violence.  I don't want to ruin your experience with this film by getting too involved in plot details.  I will say that it manages to depict families from different cultures, celebrating the same holiday together, in an incidental manner so as not to appear excessively ""Rainbow Coalition"" and politically correct (in other words, you won't feel a chorus of ""Kumbaya"" coming on).  What's more, it has ""an all star"" cast, including Alfre Woodard and Mercedes Ruehl.  I think you'll enjoy it!",1181606400,6,808,5.590163934426229

It is not schmaltzy, touchy-feely, or warm and fuzzy.  It is a gritty look at the American family while looking at four different families.  Each with their own problems, each with their own traditions, each with their own way of coping.  It is a great reminder that there is no such thing as a ""perfect holiday"" but rather any holiday with the people you love is what's important.  Don't miss seeing this tremendous movie.",1158192000,3,552,4.697916666666667
1405575,5,B000059HAU,"After reaching adulthood, a family Thanksgiving celebration became problematic as I don't consider turkey (or the ham alternative) a festive dish. I'm not hard pressed to think of a better way to spend my time - such as going out for a burger and a movie. WHAT'S COOKING only reinforces my curmudgeonly attitude, but also left me with a smile.

This film has a cast of thousands. Let's just say that it involves four American families of varied background - Jewish, Black, Vietnamese, Mexican Latino - gathering for the Turkey Day ritual. Each has a festering dysfunction.

Ruth and Herb Seelig (Lainie Kazan and Maury Chaykin) welcome their daughter Rachel (Kyra Sedgwick) home for the holiday. Rachel brings her lesbian lover Carla (Julianna Margulies), much to Mom and Dad's discomfiture. Additional relatives, not yet clued in, are scheduled to drop by.

Trin and Duc Nguyen (Joan Chen and Franois Chau) have just had #2 son ejected from school. If that isn't enough, Trin has found a condom among #1 daughter's possessions. And #1 son isn't bothering to attend the gala affair at all, but is secretly going to the home of his Latino girlfriend, the Avilas.

Mrs. Elizabeth Avila (Mercedes Ruehl) is separated from her husband Javier (Victor Rivers) since he had a tempestuous affair with her cousin. Unbeknownst to Elizabeth, son Tony (Douglas Spain) has invited Papa over for the holiday meal as he has nowhere else to go. Unbeknownst to Tony, Mom has her own bombshell to drop. And, of course, the Avila daughter, Sofia (Maria Carmen), has invited her non-Latino boyfriend.

In the meantime, Audrey Williams (Alfre Woodard) must both cook and make nice with her overly critical mother-in-law, Grace (Ann Weldon), while the former's husband, Ronald (Dennis Haysbert), referees. The state of the couple's marriage is tense, and their teenage son, Michael (Eric George), isn't expected to appear for unstated reasons, which perhaps is just as well as Ronald's approval rating of his boy is at an all-time low.

As the plot evolves, the obvious conflict in each of these households is revealed as only the tip of the iceberg.

Each of these culturally different families prepares its own favorite side dishes to accompany the de rigueur bird. Much screen time is dedicated to food preparation, and it's a joy to watch. My wife and I had a difficult time deciding which meal we'd want to crash. We ultimately decided on the Nguyen feast despite a critical culinary malfunction. KFC anyone?

Director Gurinder Chadha, and Indian woman born in Africa who grew up in London and married a Japanese-American, deftly escalates the tension in each group such that the dysfunction at each Thanksgiving table spirals out of control at the same rate, culminating in an unexpected bridge between the cultures.

WHAT'S COOKING is clever and enormously entertaining, as long as it doesn't happen to you. The fact that such or similar situations are likely commonplace in America's melting pot makes the film all the more reflective of a shared humanity. Kudos to Ms. Chadha for a thoroughly engaging movie equal to, if not better than, MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING.",1109203200,47,3150,4.9961832061068705
1405576,5,B000059HAU,"This wonderful movie by Gurinder Chadha, the British-Indian director of ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" tells the story of 4 Los Angeles families and their take on Thanksgiving celebrations. These African-American, Latino, Jewish, and Vietnamese families seem very different but their stories are connected by their relationships and hardships with eachother and their identity as Americans. Chadha also weaves in many controversial issues such as lesbianism, interracial romance, gun violence, multiculturalism and assimilation against a visual feast of traditional and ethnic foods.
This film, like all Chadha's films, is a masterpiece. She has the ability to address very controversial and complicated issues while maintaining an up-beat pace. Her films are also visually stunning with beautiful and authentic cultural elements. Chadha really understands and respects diverse cultures. I highly reccommend her first film ""Bhaji on the Beach"" and keep a look out for the up-comming film ""The Mistress of Spices"" directed by Chadha's husband based on the book by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. This will star the Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai who is in Chadha's film ""Bride and Prejudice,"" another great film to see!",1107734400,5,1208,5.679558011049724
1405577,5,B000059HAU,"This movie was great. It shows a typical thanksgiving day in four different households. It goes without saying, there are
problems in every family. If you are expecting  A WALTON MOUNTAIN THANKSGIVING or even THANKSGIVING WITH THE CLEAVERS, I'm sorry this is real.",1085961600,5,264,5.1395348837209305
1405598,5,B000059HAU,"Food and its preparation is one of the things that define us, our culture and how we come together with our families.
Writer/Director Gurinder Chadha (who will later write and direct Bend it like Beckham) brings us her first ""american"" film: an exquisite, sweet and even sexy (while brutally honest) look at contemporary family dynamics in present-day L.A, using  food (and surprisingly enough, surfer music) as the thread to sew together the trials and tribulations of four ""ethnic"" families during a Thanksgiving day.
But ""What's cooking"" is more than ""just"" a food movie, or a Thanksgiving movie. Through an amazing ensemble cast (including Academy Award winner Mercedes Ruehl), ingenous cinematography, smart direction and an outstanding script, Director Chadra makes us feel the joys and pains of these characters.
The story itself is simple: follow the lives of four West L.A. families (Latino, Vietnamese, Black and Jewish) through  a Thanksgiving Day. But immediately we get drawn into very powerful statements about love, family, community, divorce, diversity, racism, politics, tolerance and violence. We identify with these characters because we can all relate to their problems, and their family interactions.
I highly recommend this film because it is beautifully and skillfully done, and because of the great actor performances, particularly the female leads. Alfre Woodard is exquisite and brutally believable as the wife trying to keep her family together. Joan Chen, Lainie Kazan and of course Mercedes Ruehl all give extraordinary performances as the matriarchs of these families. Julianna Margulies and Kyra Sedgwick are a joy to watch as a lesbian couple. Dennis Haysbert (""24"", Far From Heaven) is fabulous also.
For all you Seinfeld fans out there, you get a glimpse of Estelle Harris in yet another Estelle Costanza incarnation. With her, the loveable Ralph Manza as uncle David (Gepetto in ""The Cigar Store Indian"").
DVD extras include interviews (they're interesting, although not well edited; it feels like they were ""thrown together"" at the last minute,sometimes even cutting off  mid-sentence, but the raw material is there), theatrical trailer, recipes, and a commentary track (with Writer/Director Chadha and co-writer and husband Paul Mayeda Berger). As expected, the commentary track gives us an inside look ad the writing, casting, production, cinematography and the filming process in general.
Expect bigger and greater things from this power couple.",1073952000,6,2484,5.49738219895288
1405599,4,B000059HAU,"This is a fun premise -- spending the Thanksgiving holiday with four very different LA families -- that is executed very well, with capable direction and a fine cast. Children are coming home and families are setting extra places as friends and members of these families -- one Asian, one Hispanic, one Jewish and one African-American -- get together and face various real-life issues such as parent-child disagreements, meeting the SO's parents, in-laws, adultery, etc. The movie could have been riddled with cliches, but a decent script and excellent cast -- including Mercedes Ruehl, Alfre Woodard, Lanie Kazan, Dennis Haysbert and Joan Chen -- make this an entertaining film that is part drama but mostly comedy. Don't watch this while you're dieting, though, as there are many scenes of the wonderful dinners being prepared.

DVD features include subtitles in English, French or Spanish; a commentary track with writer/director Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Backham) and co-writer Paul Berges; interview segments with the director on the characters and on Thanksgiving, with Kyra Sedgwick on Julianna Margulies, with Mercedes Ruehl on the film's premise, with Dennis Haysbert on Los Angeles, with Joan Chen on food, and with Alfre Woodard on Chadha; and recipes for Vietnamese spring rolls, tamales, rustic (apple) pie, macaroni & cheese, noodle kugel and oyster-shiitake stuffing.

Definitely a worthwhile rental.",1064448000,5,1419,5.416289592760181
1405600,4,B000059HAU,"Much like her 2003 hit movie ""Bend It Like Beckham"", Gurinder Chadha's ""What's Cooking?"" is infused with people who love one another very much, and so even though some tough issues are thrown their way, we know that, because of that love, they will get through life's obstacles ok.
""What's Cooking"" centers around four families living on the same block in Los Angeles. They don't know each other, however, and instead, like most modern families, are focused on their own problems and worries. Chadha makes good use of ""the American melting pot"" idea, as one family is Italian, one is hispanic, one is black, and one is Asian. One of the most wonderful aspects of the movie is that, even though the people are of different ethnicities, they are portrayed respectfully as human beings. We can relate to each of them. They are different, but the same. Isn't that the underlying truth of us all? People are, indeed, people.
There are some nice performances here: Alfre Woodard is great as a stressed, neglected wife. Dennis Haysbert is quiet, cool and simmering as her husband. Mercedes Ruehl shines as the mother of the hispanic family, trying to move on with her life from an ex-husband that just won't understand that it's over between them. Kyra Sedgwick and Julianna Margulies are endearing as a lesbian couple on their first trip to meet the parents. Estelle Harris (of ""Seinfeld"" fame) is deliciously wicked as the aunt who just keeps pushing the issue. And, of course, there's Lainie Kazan -- always a treat.
I saw this film at Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival in 2003, and it was very well-received. There are dramatic, serious moments, and then there are quite hilarious moments. The theater was filled with laughter a number of times, and deservedly so. In the end, this is a 'feel-good' film. And one which will also have you salivating throughout, as each family is busy cooking and preparing their Thanksgiving dinners.
This is the second Gurinder Chadha movie that I have seen, and from what I have tell, she seems to really believe the best of people. Yes, we fight. Yes, we quarrel. Yes, we disagree. But at the heart of humanity has to be love and understanding, if we are to get along and survive. ""What's Cooking"" embodies this sentiment wonderfully. It was a joy to watch.",1062547200,17,2295,4.797979797979798
1405601,1,B000059HAU,"The story is boring, plot-development uninteresting and slow, and the overdramatic cast, especially the younger ones that might benefit from a few years' worth of acting lessons, not worth the while.

Like the culinary theme, which also left me hungry, this is one film which will whet your appetite for the acutely accurate portrayal of the immigrant society in America. I know as an Asian I was stunned by the director's resounding voice in her unflinching representation of that community. And the range of emotions it will evoke will leave you laughing, crying, thinking...just from one scene to another. I also appreciate the really uncheesy, un-gratituous lesbian story-line (but of course a lady director would know better!)

Though the story lines are familiar, the laughter and emotions keep this movie from being a leftover Turkey sandwich.
The fantastic ensemble cast includes the always wonderful Alfre Woodard as a woman fighting the stress of maintaining peace in her family.  Mercedes Ruehl turns in another good performance as a level-headed matriarch rebounding from a cheating husband.  Kyra Sedgwick and Julianna Margulies are delicious as a lesbian couple trying not to spar with one set of parents (enably played by Lainie Kazan and Maury Chakin).  Joan Chen is also great playing a tradition-based parent losing a battle against her rebelling teenage kids.  Toss in Estelle Harris for extra laughs and wonderful turns from much of the supporting cast, and you can't go wrong.
Though the movies' editing is somehwat choppy, it comes together nicely at the end.  I'd highly recommend filling your plate with an extra helping of this gem.  The enjoyment of laughter, possible tears, and multi-ethnic traditions make this one a winner.",996537600,17,1201,5.2894736842105265
