While at first I was surprised why the film never got nominated for any awards,I was even more surprised to find out later that it was a TV movie! Well, films made for television can not get better than this, and it is unfortunate it did not get a theater release, for its style, script,acting and direction are way above average.
The plot mainly revolves around the racial tension divide in the early 60s, and most particularly the bombing of an African American church in Alabama in '63 by racists that killed innocent people. This incident resulted in a tug of war between the FBI and the main suspect that lasted nearly four decades, before he was finally put behind bars. Yet the film offers much more,it is also a look at a dysfunctional family and the difficult relationship between a father/the main suspect and his son who has carried the guilt of knowning the truth for too long ,but remained silent for years out of duty, uncertainty and love for his father, before his conscience, guilt and the memories of his childhood that haunted him, pushed him to cooperate with the authorities, and bring his father to justice. This is very powerful writng by John Pielmeier based on a short article in Texas Monthly by Pamela Collof. The quality of the writing is not unlike Paul Schrader's masterpiece Affliction.
Although the film, (directed by Robert Dornhelm whose best work was the underrated Echo Park back in '86), has many flashbacks, which normally can be annoying,yet in the case of Sins of the Father they are very well edited, and enhance the plot.
Lastly I want to say  few words about the acting.
While Tom Sizemore gives his best acting to date, I was blown away by one particular actor: Richard Jenkins!! What a great performance!! His portrayal of the racist,hate filled,cold and strict father is mind blowing! Buying the film is worth it for Jenkins alone!
So Sins of The Father is an excellent drama, a film that will totally surprise and captivate you, a movie worthy to be in your collection. Do Not Miss!!",1068768000,10,2150,4.6878306878306875

Like the other reviewer, I can only praise the excellent script and the fine performances from Sizemore, Jenkins, Rhames, and Fiore.  Closeups of Sizemore's agonized face bring this viewer almost to tears.  Jenkin's intensity, seen in both the frequent flashbacks and present-time scenes, is awesome.  Rhames provides the ""conscience"" that brings Sizemore to the realization that he must reveal his father's past.  And Fiore is quite good as the FBI agent, determined to right the wrong of the death of the four little black girls, so long ago in Montgomery.
Also, in lesser yet pivotal roles, are Lachlan Murdock as young ""Tom"" and Brenda Bazinet as his cancer-stricken mother.  The two actors bring conviction to their roles as persons caught up in an abusive home and the turbulent times of the Civil Rights Movement.
It is hard to imagine that this fine film didn't sweep the Emmy Awards of 2003 for its teleplay or the acting.",1074902400,4,1022,5.023668639053255
