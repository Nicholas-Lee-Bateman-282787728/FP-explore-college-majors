2654594,5,B000ICLS88,I think that this is a really excellent system. The only issue I have is it doesn't clearly say what style sals this is.  There are sever differnt styles and I was looking for cuban.  Other than that it is really great and I have heard from my friends that have purchased other systems and they are not as pleased with theirs.,1303084800,,326,4.241935483870968
2654595,5,B000ICLS88,"Very detailed, starting with the basics. Very funny teachers. You'll learn progressively and you'll want to see next chapters. Very addictive. Your life will change :-)",1259020800,,168,5.5
2654596,5,B000ICLS88,This DVD set is perfect for the beginner as well as those who've already taken salsa lessons.  I've been taking salsa lessons for 3 months and the first 2 DVD's have covered everything I've learned in class if not more.  Every move is broken down and is easy to follow for both the lead and follower.,1240099200,3,300,4.339285714285714
2654597,5,B000ICLS88,"I have not had any Salsa training/classes before. These DVDs are easy to follow. The tips and instructions here are clear and make salsa easy. Besides, you can play it over and over again until it flows easily. It works!",1235174400,2,220,4.525
2654598,5,B000ICLS88,"The instructor on the DVD breaks steps down, and repeats them. Before you know it you will be dancing entire salsa patterns. Of course practice is the key to look smooth on the dance floor.

I live in south america, and im a gringo, so i needed help. I am learning salsa at 40, so there is still hope if you have never had dance lessons in your life.  I got tired of techno music, and i despirately needed a way to have fun on the weekends. this is it!

With the first DVD you will be able to learn the basic moves, and build on that with a handfull of cool patterns with lots of turns.

After you get going you'll be having fun in no time. It's much easier to learn than spanish!",1202428800,6,680,4.014814814814815
2654599,5,B000ICLS88,I got exactly what I was expecting when I bought the mastery system. The steps and patterns are very well explained in detail. Also is fun to watch and I can review as many times as I need to.,1192147200,3,192,3.948717948717949
2654600,5,B000ICLS88,"A friend who is a good dancer and salsa teacher recommended these DVD's including the beginner ones.  I like them.  Produced in the Bay Area the instrucion is 'on 1'.  I have been taking lessons 'on 1' in clubs and in a local studio since end of 2006 and I am an intermediate dancer.  I thought I would not learn much from the first videos in the series but would only use them to get friends interested and started.  In fact I have picked up a bit of styling for basic moves as well as some valuable tips in the first week of just watching.  Really I have also picked up some new moves from the beginner videos which surprised me.  I have watched once with some friends and we had fun with it and learned together.

Most of my dancing in the clubs has been in the open position, but much of the videos teach from the closed position with many of the turns lead into with an open break.  The dancers are very smooth. The first videos go slow but some of the tips with details about hand positions, angles,and connection are helpful.  The teachers give many variations of the same move which I appreciate as a lead.  The teacher is silly and that keeps it entertaining.  I plan to go through the videos by myself and with friends to add to my and our dancing repertoire, especially in the closed postion.  I will update this if I can as I spend more time with the videos.

In addition to instruction I liked the history of salsa interview at the end of the first video.  The history is not just the music but on the origin of the body movements.  Nods are given to Africa, Cuba, Puerto Rico, ballroom dancing in US especially in New York.  Additionally there is info on etiquette from the teacher which is either helpful or funny.",1181260800,32,1729,4.303405572755418
2654601,5,B000ICLS88,"We've tried several salsa courses, but this is by far the best.

Despite being at intermediate level with other courses, we started from the beginning with this one and we're really glad we did so. In this DVD they really take their time to teach you everything, and we've discovered and understood now many things that are not clear in other courses.

This is a must if you want to learn salsa on your own.",1179532800,16,407,4.413333333333333
2654602,5,B000ICLS88,"I bought this 5 set CD thinking I could probably skip most of the beginner stuff.  I was wrong!  I had been taking private lessons for 2 years on and off.  The 3 beginner tapes were more than just informative.  I had been learning more of a ballroom style, and these tapes have the kind of moves I actually see on the dance floor.  I was leery of learning by a CD method because I had checked out a tape from the library and did not feel like I had learned anything.  The leader role is well explained in these tapes, from hand position to feet - step by step.  And the progression from different leads and moves is very logical and easy to develop upon.  There are some places where the instructor misspeaks and says one thing and does another, so the tape could be improved upon - that is a criticism.  The 3 CD beginner set might be as far as you want to go, because the intermediate tapes are too advanced for me so far (after a month of having the tapes).  I think this is a good way to learn Salsa.  My partner did not want to go out and dance with me for 4 years, but when I started learning with these tapes we went out and had a good time on the dance floor for the first time!  Thank you Salsa Crazy!",1175126400,26,1210,4.03781512605042
2654603,5,B000ICLS88,My girlfriend and I have watched the video and frankly it is one of the best dance video I have seen. Clear and concise on position and movements.

We were not beginners and were a bit concerned about ordering this set since we thought we might be too advanced for the 1st cd.

However Im glad we still went though even the first cd as they go through very small details that have now made our salsa better.

We are now in the 2nd cd and are learning tons of new turns and ways to move with the salsa step.. more updates later!",1456444800,,449,3.966666666666667

EMMA LOYEZ",1454544000,,87,4.5
2654616,5,B000ICLS88,"I love this salsa system! I took salsa group lessons for about 6 months and I still learned new things here with the beginner system. I'm 3/4 way thru it. These DVD's filled in the missing puzzle pieces for my salsa dancing. I used to dance with a trained pro (ex-boyfriend) and he couldn't help me correct a mistake I was making: when the lead turns in front of me, I'm supposed to do stationary salsa! Here, I learned what was causing the lead to feel like I was pulling his arm! Which I was..and unaware of.
This salsa system is extensive and its geared towards the leaders; which makes sense because they do most of the work in salsa. As a follow, this helps me to learn to recognize the signals I'm given. He breaks it down frame by frame, it's meticulous. I don't always have the patience to watch the leader's part, but I just go to scene selection for the follower's parts and tips. Or I play my salsa music, do my basic and just watch!!!
Also, I love the interviews and resources (websites) that are included. This helps to give the salsa dancer more knowledge and appreciation for the history, culture, community and art of Salsa! I love that I can learn at my own pace and make my mistakes in private. Thank you!!!",1454112000,,1225,4.37719298245614

2654620,4,B000ICLS88,"I've only started using the DVDs a few days ago. While it is a step-by-step tutorial, I didn't like the background or the dark-colored baggy pants the guy was wearing. It made it difficult to see how the steps were supposed to be taken. Dark background + dark baggy pants = difficulty viewing ALL steps needed to complete the round. His steps were gradual, if you're the leader, but if you're the follower, it's not as gradual. I will have to finish the set before I give more feedback.

2654641,5,B000ICLS88,"I accepted a review sample of this set to learn the dancers' perspective of the music. Also, I am not thoroughly versed in the music style so I wanted to immerse myself in that as well.

This set painstakingly leads you through the basis to the intermediate level. You are provided with lessons that show basic moves and steps, and build upon those with increasing degrees of complexity. There are no leaps or gaps - you are few manageable lessons that you really can learn and even master if you take your time and work through them. I tried a few just to see how well this DVD set works for dancers and - it does!

To be honest I did not work through each lesson, but I have gone through this entire set three times and will revisit it occasionally. After the second pass I was starting to 'get' the music, which is why I gave it five stars. More importantly, I now have an understanding of the rhythms and the pulse that dancers both expect and need - and I can connect the dots between my role as a drummer and theirs as dancers.

If you want to learn the dance part this is a great starting point. If you are a non-Salsa musician or even one who is new to Afro-Cuban rhythms and their Puerto Rican (and New York) variants,  you will also find this set to be invaluable.",1424649600,2,1274,4.25206611570248

There five disc to choose from, that will make you a well rounded dancer. The first three are for beginners while the last two are intermediate dancers.

After watching the first disc, I was able to use my legs for more than just waling. No I am not scared to step on the dance floor at someone's wedding.

2654644,5,B000ICLS88,"I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

I have scoured the Internet looking for free Salsa tutorials and have found that most of them suffer from the following flaws: too fast-paced, ad hoc, less-than-comprehensive, or downright atrocious. Don't get me wrong, there ARE some VERY high caliber, professional-level productions out there, with clear, clean, and crisp 1080p video quality to boot -- all to be had for free.

BUT I haven't found a single salsa tutorial that slooows down the dance steps enough so I can follow along and confidently know I've done the dance steps correctly. That's why I love this DVD set. It breaks down each dance step into easy-to-follow segments and THEN gently walks you through into reintegrating these segments into fluid and seamless salsa dance movements.

By ""movements,"" I'm not just talking about the movements of the feet but the movements of your arms and the rest of your body -- something that comes so naturally to some people, but not to folks like myself who have severe coordination problems! The dance instructors will show you how to gracefully move your arms and the rest of your body i.e. how to ""use the space around you"" so your feet won't seem like a disjunct part of you executing the salsa dance moves while the rest of your body simply tags along.

It also helps that the main dance instructor, Evan Margolin, is vivacious and engaging (he pairs up with different dance partners) and he sets a very fun and relaxing tone to the lessons.

Some tips: 1) use full length mirror(s), 2) record and analyze your dance moves on video, 3) have that remote handy to replay parts of the video you need to work on.

Let me assure you, this DVD is very aptly titled ""Salsa Dancing Mastery System."" If you're willing to put in the work, I'm certain this dance system will help you learn and ultimately master those salsa dance moves. In no time, you'll be brandishing your dance moves like a true salsa master ;). If you're REALLY serious about learning/mastering salsa, this DVD set is well worth the investment. If you're still scouring the Internet for free salsa tutorials, stop. Do yourself a favor and get this DVD set instead.",1422921600,,2197,4.738219895287958

Further, the repetition and step-by-step modeling of each move is indispensable almost to a fault. I have no agenda here but to give an honest assessment and this is it. I watched all 5 videos in just about 2 days from the enthusiasm that moved me as I progressed through the series.

I love the fact that I can learn salsa in the comfort of my own home for a fraction of the cost of in studio dance lessons.

I found that this DVD set really broke things down in an intricate level, which is especially helpful for me since I pay very close attention to detail and love delving into things wholeheartedly, including learning the history behind the salsa dance.

I love the fact that I can pause and rewind as much as I need. My favorite part of the way this DVD set was produced is the fact that there is a picture-in-picture in the bottom left hand corner with the footwork up close.

It's been a lot of fun as well as exercise! I'd definitely purchase other dance lessons from SalsaCrazy again!

2654649,5,B000ICLS88,"I received the complete Salsa Dance Mastery System for review, which is a 5 DVD set with almost 10 hours of instruction. The 5 DVDs included are the Beginners Vol. 1, 2, & 3, and Intermediate Vol. 1 & 2.

The instructor (Evan) was very clear, and took things slowly. He went over the basic rhythms and steps over and over to give you plenty of time to get the feel for Salsa beats. There is also the picture in picture feature in these DVDs, so you can watch the total picture or a closeup of the footwork.

In the first DVD you learn the basic footwork, some breaks and turns, and a few stylistic moves to get you right out and dancing. In addition to the dance instruction, there are great bonus features on the DVD that go over some basic dance floor etiquette, like how to ask, how to accept, and how to refuse. There is also as history of Salsa that I found interesting.

The second DVD takes up where the first DVD left off and expounds on the instruction you learned in Vol. 1, and also features music by Benny Velarde. You'll learn additional turns, rolls, handhold patterns, and stylistic moves that will make you look like a pro. An extra feature in this disc is an additional beginner's dance floor etiquette tip that is probably the most important! ;)

The third DVD also comes right off of the instruction in Volume 2. You'll learn more difficult patterns, turns, and moves that will bring you right up to Intermediate level. An additional DVD feature continues the beginners etiquette lesson.

The fourth DVD is actually the first Intermediate DVD. If you finished 1-3, you've done all of the Beginner's lessons. In this DVD, you'll learn much more difficult footwork and moves like double turns and more patterns with multiple variations, all set to some great salsa music. You'll also get more tips and etiquette.

The fifth DVD finishes up your Intermediate lessons to bring you right up to advanced Salsa dancing. You'll learn more difficult patterns, and styling tips and techniques to help you look as smooth as possible on the dance floor. You'll also learn some dips, which hadn't been covered yet.

Overall, these were pretty easy to learn with a huge amount of clear instruction and lots of practice (not that they were all that easy to do, lol!) The instructor starts with the very basics and builds on those moves to get more and more complicated. But while things are speeding up, you're still getting so much repetition of the basics, that it will really stick with you. Nothing is just thrown at you; You'll learn the basics of every move before you get too advanced. Also, you'll get an amazing workout!

I loved this DVD and when I'm ready to learn another dance, I'll definitely get them from Dance Crazy.",1418774400,9,2737,4.605749486652978
2654650,4,B000ICLS88,"The Salsa Dancing Mastery System is a very thorough 5 DVD Salsa dance course. There are a lot of things I love about this DVD set and I actually have (and will be reviewing) several instructional DVDs by SalsaCrazy. I received a copy of this set to facilitate this review.

Level: This DVD set is suitable for beginners to intermediate Salsa dancers. And by beginner, I mean absolute beginners would benefit from the very thorough instruction.

The first disk primarily covers fundamentals and can see a little dry. It covers important basics like how to count the music, leading and following, and basic steps. It also has an interesting discussion on the history of Salsa dance--as a dance enthusiast I am always interested in the cultural background where a dance style evolves. I appreciate that they include this in the fundamental beginners DVD!

I have previously taken Salsa dance classes and use to socially dance Salsa. I am rusty as it has been a while. I found the first DVD a little tedious and was worried about the rest. I think all the information is useful and practice and repetition are key, but others with some background may also feel impatient. Don't worry! The pace does pick up in later disks in the set. By the end of the second DVD, I was quite impressed with how many Salsa moves were already taught. I think many beginners could enjoy themselves on a night out dancing just with the material on the first disk and especially the material on the first two DVDs. I also think a couple dancing with just the moves from the first DVD or two would look fabulous on the dancefloor if they do those moves well and in time. This makes me think this set would also be excellent for couples who want to prepare for a wedding or event. Or for couples  with limited access to a sitter who want to make the most of their date nights. I have heard people say they would love to take lessons but cannot afford to hire a sitter an extra night a week.

The set is well chaptered with every movement or lesson in it's own chapter that you can access from the menu. I have one wish for improvement... I like the chaptering, but with a five DVD set it is overwhelming to find the section of interest to review. I wish they had a paper menu in the liner notes like some other instructional DVD sets. I have a couple small issues with the production, my biggest issue is that in the first DVD, the set is dark (like a night club) and the dancers are wearing dark clothes. It was a little challenging to see the detail on my television (a 33"" flatscreen). It was even worse on my laptop screen. However, the producers correct this problem in the later DVDs in the series.

I think this set would be highly helpful to a person who wants to dance Salsa, but is intimidated by the music or feels he/she has no sense of rhythm. The instructor breaks down the rhythm is excellent--it does not assume any musical ability. He also counts the music during the practice loops--this was a little tedious to my ears but is a great instructional technique to help you hear the rhythm without thinking. The more you practice to it, the easier you will be able to naturally move to the rhythm like someone with a strong innate sense of rhythm.

I highly recommend this set to anyone who is interested in a thorough, logically presented system to learn Salsa dancing at home. It is also a very useful practice companion if you are taking salsa dance classes.",1418342400,3,3449,4.482484076433121

We haven't gotten to those yet! My husband really can't get passed the first disc, (not a good dancer at all) lol but he's trying!

2654666,5,B000ICLS88,"I am very VERY happy with the SalsaCrazy dvd set.

I am a novice, but have always loved to dance and ALWAYS wanted to learn Salsa, but could never afford classes.

This set seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to learn with.

As soon as the first scene started rolling, I knew I was going to enjoy this and DID.

This set begins with the absolute basics...literally counting the beats. There is no way you won't pick up the footwork if you watch this and dance along with the instruction. If you have any trouble at all, you just have to rewind to the part you need help on, and redo it until you have it down.

The steps are explained so well, and broken down and counted out for you. Aside from the occasional stumble (hey, had to get my sea legs again! I mean, SALSA legs), I easily picked up the first steps as I followed along with the instruction, and was instantly hooked.

I love the music, I love the dancing, and I LOVE the personable instructors, who make the moves so much easier to understand and implement as a beginner!

The wonderful thing about this set is that instead of just explaining some moves and sending you on your way, you get total immersion. Disc One includes dance and club etiquette (which I thought was a fantastic bonus. Who wants to look like they don't know what they're doing?), Salsa history, and the adorably funny outtakes at the end. I got a good laugh out of those, and was actually a really nice way to end the disc and cool down at the same time!

Each disc was fun but informative at the same time. I felt like I was with them in the dance studio by the end, without having to leave the house, or pay the high fees of in person instruction.

With easy instruction, warm personalities, and all the extra benefits included in this set, I am a believer in the system and am incredibly excited to go out and try the moves on the dance floor!

I received this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion",1416528000,2,1948,4.3123287671232875

2654668,5,B000ICLS88,"I've always taken great interest in dance but I must admit I'm not as good as I want to be mostly because it is so time consuming to goto classes so my commitment wasn't there.  I started taking interest in salsa after my friend introduced me to it and I was amazed how quickly she had learned in a short period of time.  After asking her how she learned so fast, she recommended me to this dance dvd set so I decided to give it a shot.  This set is very comprehensive and even served to be very instructive even for a complete newb like myself.  After going through a few lessons my friend and I started practicing together where she would usually lead and she was even surprised to see that I've already picked up all the basics from watching just a few lessons.

Learning to dance in the privacy of my own home is definitely less embarrassing than it would be in front of a classroom.  I can easily skip, rewind, or pause at my own convenience and I'm not tied down to a continuous hour of a lesson when sometimes I just want to take a long break.  The learning techniques are comprehensive to say the least and although I'm not at the advanced lessons yet, I'm making very good progress and starting to feel less self conscious.  I'm pretty certain I can learn more from these dvds at a lower cost than I would paying for hourly lessons so I doubt I'll be paying for any more dance lessons.  After learning salsa, I'm beginning to wonder what other types of dance I can learn from these dvd sets.",1415923200,2,1500,4.290780141843972

I loved these because it was easy to learn some dips, and slides, in the comfort of my home before going out to club and showing off my newly acquired dance moves.

The instructors are great easy to follow and know what they are doing.

2654671,5,B000ICLS88,"The Complete Salsa Dance Mastery System is awesome and a lot of fun! I have been to salsa night at a club in town a couple times just to watch people, but I never courage or confidence to try to learn how to dance previously. It always looked like a great time. I ordered this 5 DVD system and started to learn from the comfort of my own home. It was nice to be able to watch and learn the steps and be able to go back and practice them again and again until I became more fluid in my moves. This was a great learning technique that really worked for me. I was able to learn quickly using this DVD set and have now become confident enough to go to the club on salsa night and have a great time dancing like everyone else! This video tutorial set has a lot to offer not only the beginner but the intermediate to advanced dancer as well. It feels great to know how to dance and it is such a great workout too.

2654672,1,B000ICLS88,"The SalsaCrazy Presents: the Complete Salsa Dance Mastery System,6 DVD Package,Learn to Salsa Dance! Utterly horrible, don't waste your money. The lack of real pros teaching salsa is obvious, is easy for any clown to make a quick buck by putting together a pseudo ""Salsa dance Mastery System"" and mislead a bunch of people. In case you did not know, there are waaay better out there, bonafide Masters of teaching salsa, their instruction material is really easy to follow for different skill levels: Salomon Rivera, Alberto Torres, Josie Neglia, Johnny Vasquez,Luis Vasquez, and a few others whose several World Championships of Salsa Competition backs them up,just google their names and voila, you got yourself a real good Salsa instruction DVDs.
 I you are really interested in learning salsa the right way, buy DVD from the real pros, unless you are fine with  looking like a robot on the dance floor with a boring canned choreography, and having no personality or style, and no idea what Salsa really stands for.

The vibe I got from the DVD is it's an instructional set on how to dance ""club salsa"", which in most cases most latinos will teach you that anyways. Ballroom salsa is just that....BALLROOM. This is for the clubs. Have your remote handy, because you will have to rewind and redo the move. Remember, practice makes perfect, and if you want to tear it up at the clubs, you need a partner.

8144858,4,B000ICLS88,"As a very experienced social and studio dancer over close to 3 decades,
versed in more than 80 partner dances and variations, I already had the
advanced set of Salsa from this same company which was a little over
my head; so when I got the funds together, I opted to go over the beginner/
intermediate set which is not available through interlibrary loan from the
public library and which was a good idea, and to my surprise it was extremely
well done, with great technique and for the most part flawless, wanting only
in three ways:
1) the contrast necessary to see the movements between the
dancer's clothes and the dance background and the lighting was insufficient,
a production flaw, in the beginner's part, adequate
in the Intermediate; (the advanced 6 DVD set is very much better);
2) the verbal description and the execution of the ""spot"" turn (top) was incon-
sistent within the instruction and with other dance instructional description
versions by other companies and teachers: i.e. grape-vine
vs.behind, side, behind (more consistent for the female partner, however),
versus that of other descriptions: either beh.,side, beh.; side beh., side or
beh. side, cross front, side, xf, side.
3) the plastic packaging is very friable, from my experience with the advanced
series being totally insecure from outside forces; so I have to be very careful
with its storage.
Otherwise, I found the material well worth the purchase, and added greatly to my
enjoyment of this dance, very authentic. Of course, it would help to have some
prior experience, physical prowess, and an adequate and willing partner, a good
dance floor and adequate dance shoes and music.",1489017600,2,1662,5.003610108303249
