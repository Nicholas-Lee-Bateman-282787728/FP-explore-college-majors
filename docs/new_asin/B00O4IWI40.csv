Ol' Charlie's 10 main features, produced between 1921-1957, are included here in officially-licensed transfers from Soul Media of Denmark. The discs are all vanilla (plain), that is to say they have the film only, with no extras and are region B-locked. This makes them almost identical to the UK's Park Circus editions, except in some cases these actually feature superior audio and video mastering.
