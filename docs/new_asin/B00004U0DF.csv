7923402,5,B00004U0DF,"Dreamaster Productions has released one of the most helpful and powerful videos in helping you develop a home-based business. Seven entrepreneurs share with you the ""secrets"" of their success in developing their own businesses right from their homes.
  Unlike other ""how-to"" videos this one is highly detailed in giving you the needed information to start up your business. The persons interviewed give you concrete no nonsense information about how to start your business from the ground up. They share with you their weaknesses, failures and great successes to let you know what getting into this area entails.
  Meet Larry Brockham, who was passed over for promotion in his bank job and decided to quit. With little capital, he started his own home business as a marketing consultant for doctors. Ann Morris, who has the ""handicap"" of blindness started her own mail order business that sells products to the blind. Richard Bangs loves adventures and developed his idea into a travel adventure agency. These are just some of the people who found their passion, developed their niche and went about the process of making their vision become a reality.
  I would advise anyone who is thinking of or has started a home-based business to purchase and view this video. It will clarify for you if you have what it takes to become a home based operation. In addition you will receive a wealth of information from people who have been through the process and are willing to share their experience with you.",993254400,,1500,4.956175298804781
