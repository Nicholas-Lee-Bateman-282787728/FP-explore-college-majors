5993218,5,B00FI9MHXQ,"A witty and very human story about Italy's north meets south. A very uptight postal inspector is horrified to find himself transferred to the South of Italy. He cries on the way down, and arrives full of prejudices and misconceptions, only to be warmly welcomed. I won't spoil it too much but he leaves in tears again, in fulfilment of a local saying that people cry twice on arriving, once when they arrive and again when they leave. Fans of Valentina Lodovini will appreciate the cinematography :)
This film received an ovation when screened at the Italian Film Festival in Sydney 2011, the first time I've ever seen this happen.
It also has English subtitles !",1330128000,7,663,4.724137931034483
5993219,5,B00FI9MHXQ,Video is in PAL version only so be very careful. Movie is very funny and entertaining. You really must understand Italian and a bit of Neapolitan dialect to fully enjoy. Supplier Libreria Pino was excellent. I received the movie 2 days after I ordered it.,1322352000,,255,4.688888888888889

I was a little worried because DVD description did not say there were English subtitles, as it turned are there are.

As for order process, item shipped within one day of order..shipping time from Germany to Arizona was about a week.",1307923200,8,435,4.506329113924051
5993222,1,B00FI9MHXQ,"Buyer Beware -  I purchased this DVD and nowhere did it say that it would not work on American DVD or Blu Ray players.  I now find myself with a DVD that we can not use.  I have not yet tried to contact the seller, as they are in Italy.",1302220800,,236,3.68
5993223,4,B00FI9MHXQ,Most people don' t know about mesa giorno or half a day old or how the northern Italians feel about the Southern Italians and visa versa.  These movies show it in a very funny and entertaining way.  It would be worth buying a DVD player that plays  both PAL & NTSC formats.,1427068800,2,273,4.211538461538462
5993224,5,B00FI9MHXQ,Absolutely hysterical! You will especially appreciate it if you have relatives from Italy.,1424044800,,90,6.0

5993231,5,B00FI9MHXQ,"I had seen the French original, ""Welcome to the Sticks"" (English translation), and was curious how the Italian version would pan out.  I wasn't disappointed and it is just as funny as the original.  Yes, it follows the original script closely but it has been Italianized which gives it its own unique flavor.  Having friends from both northern and southern Italy, I couldn't help but laugh at how their respective regional viewpoints were so well skewered.
  My particular copy of this DVD was recently purchased in Europe and is in PAL format which means you need a region-free DVD player to view it here in the US.  As with other reviewers, my copy did not say it had English subtitles on the outside but rest assured it does provide them.
  A delightful movie to watch.",1375920000,4,772,4.666666666666667
5993232,4,B00FI9MHXQ,It's really funny even if you don't understadn the nuance between northern and southern Italian dialect. Definitely worth watching this flick.,1371427200,,142,5.809523809523809

8615878,5,B00FI9MHXQ,A wonderful duo of comedies.  I didn't know about the rivalry in Italy between the north and south of Italy until I watched these and they are so well acted and directed.  Definitely worth buying.,1503705600,,196,4.571428571428571
8615879,5,B00FI9MHXQ,"I saw these films at a local Italian film festival and fell in love with them. Like every country, there are stereotypes from one region to another. These are stories of men who embrace the differences of the new region that they are sent . It was also a learning experience for me concerning the dialect differences.",1466640000,,317,4.578947368421052
8615880,1,B00FI9MHXQ,I could watch it. It kept in giving me an am error code. I think it wasn't the correct zone. Will send it back for refund,1448323200,,121,3.6923076923076925

8615883,3,B00FI9MHXQ,"I love this movie and was so excited to see that I could find it on DVD. However I did not pay attention to the fact that this is a Region 2 DVD meaning it won't work in most DVD players outside of region 2 (Europe, Middle East, ect). Make sure your DVD player can play DVDs from Region 2 before purchasing!

All in all, love the movie, just wish I had read the part that said it is a region 2 DVD. Now I just need to find a way to watch it...",1435708800,2,443,3.7127659574468086
8615884,1,B00FI9MHXQ,I couldn't play it on my DVD player.....Bummer!.....I guess European DVD players are different.,1428969600,,95,5.857142857142857
8615885,4,B00FI9MHXQ,"A great film, with a light-hearted, sometimes slap-stick, humour that's very much about prejudice, and change.  Some of the plot is over the top, but given the subject that was to be expected, but all up it's very enjoyable.

Warning: you have to be happy with subtitles, as the film isn't dubbed.",1428883200,,297,4.6923076923076925
