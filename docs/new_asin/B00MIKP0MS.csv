8672647,1,B00MIKP0MS,"Sadly, I must add my disdain for this pathetic excuse of a 'mummy' movie to that of the other reviewers - I was hoping for more.  To be generous - this totally felt like a college film school exercise.  It features: annoying characters - by-the numbers boring plot - zero production values - NO skin nor 'scares'.  The purported 'star' of the piece (Priya Rai) who portrays the titular ""Isis"" has an authentic middle eastern (Egyptian?) look, and a pretty impressive set of mammaries, but she is never allowed to 'release them'... an element that might have raised the rating by a half star or so. In fact - the 'lady mummy' gets very little screen time at all. The female Director of this flik seems to have gotten caught up in the inane banter between the 'students' in the plot and forgotten 'why' anyone usually sits thru this type of 'film'(gore and T&A).  The box cover art is the perhaps the only redeeming element... and IT is mis-leading - alluding, as it does, to some 'topless mummy' action - that it never delivers.  Save your money and give this one a pass - don't think we want to 'encourage' this fly-by-night enterprise.",1419033600,10,1136,4.5763546798029555
8672648,1,B00MIKP0MS,"The actors are wooden, the sets are terrible. The whole movie is shot in two small rooms the are supposed to be in a museum. What can you expected from a company calling itself alley cat. The on a scale of 1-10 the movie rates  a minus 100, please give this movie a miss.",1416700800,7,271,4.018518518518518
8672649,1,B00MIKP0MS,"The story introduces the myth of Isis, Osiris, and Set and claims it is real. A group of college students accidentally revives Isis and some of them get their careers ended in the process. The acting and script is porn quality bad. Indeed, it almost appears as they wrote this to be a soft core porn movie but then couldn't afford the actresses.

Very bad. Avoid at all cost.
