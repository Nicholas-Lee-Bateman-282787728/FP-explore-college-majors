1859189,5,B00008RH0Z,"Have you heard a bass player make his instrument sing before? Do you think Mona Lisa is a pretty corny tune as I did before listening to this CD? Keith's well known utterances are not distracting, maybe because we have the visual aspect now. The trio's passion for the music is very evident here. Is it just me or does Gary Peacock appear to be in tears at the end of Mona Lisa (?)...but with good reason.

A nice contrast of uptempo bebop and great ballads, Never Let Me Go, for example. Have you ever found yourself lost in a song then coming back and asking 'are they in the bridge or where', but then you don't really care, the music floats and finds a life on its own... well this will happen when you listen to this great performance.",1131062400,4,740,4.285714285714286
1859190,5,B00008RH0Z,"If you enjoyed the ""Live at the Open Theater East"" DVD, I think you'll also like this one very much. I found the music here to be a little more introspective, and full of lyricism and beautiful melodies. I liked everything, but my favorites are ""Never Let Me Go"", a wonderful version of ""Summer Night"", then a fantastic ""Autumn Leaves"" with a brief final improvisation based on ""Speak Low"", ""Last Night When We Were Young"" which evolves into ""Caribbean Sky"", and ""My Funny Valentine"" with a final part based on ""A Song"". The video images are very good and capture interesting expressions and attitudes from the artists, the sound track is also excellent, but not as relevant as in the above mentioned ""Live at..."" DVD, which was outstanding. In this new DVD the sound mix is more conventional, the drums are behind the other two instruments, and not on a same level as in the previous one. The sound of the piano is not as good here, perhaps due to the number and quality of the microphones used, perhaps in part due to the instrument itself. Considering the small number of good Jazz DVDs available so far, I don't hesitate to recommend this one.",1057622400,19,1147,4.627450980392157

7986511,5,B00008RH0Z,"This is a superb film of a 1996 concert by the Standards trio playing live in Japan. Keith Jarrett is on Piano, Gary Peacock on double bass and Jack DeJohnette is on drums.

As you'd expect with this trio, who when this was recorded had been playing together for over ten years, the music is of an incredibly high standard (excuse pun). Beautiful ballads, fast bop, funky blues and a few other styles are all given a good work-out, so there is something for everyone here.

Yes Keith Jarrett is slightly irratating to watch, as he writhes around the Piano, and I'd also admit he is probably a rather pretentious individual. However he is about as good (that being a vast understatement)as it gets when it comes to making music. So if you don't like watching Jarrett just listen.

The DVD runs to just over 100 minutes and is in 4:3 format.",1215216000,,839,4.506578947368421
7986512,5,B00008RH0Z,"If you can name all of the categories by which a concert DVD might be judged, I would have to say that this one receives the highest marks in every! Beginning with the performance of the musicians, individually and collectively, this DVD contains one of the finest. If the camera work had been less clear or unrevealing, the performance alone would have saved the day. Remarkably the camera work gets equally high marks. Just as ECM (their record label) is lauded for its' ability to deliver incredibly clear and beautifully sonic cd's, so has Image Entertainment come through with the goods visually! This is my first time seeing Keith Jarrett perform on stage. The people who were filming and who edited the footage did a great job in capturing the emotion with which K.J. plays! His performance is so captivating because he is so genuinely held by the music. I get the sense that we are being allowed to participate in a deeply personal ritual between Keith, his piano, and his trio. Rather than being a third wheel, the audience is made to feel very welcome and indeed finds its' place definitively as the musicians respond to the crowd's approval.
Messrs. Peacock and DeJohnette are equal partners in this trio. There are unbelieveable camera angles revealing some of the best footage of Jack's playing I've ever seen. Even his Homespun instructional DVD doesn't give us such a look at the master's touch. The sound quality and the camera choices leave nothing for desire. If you are a fan of jazz music and you are interested in seeing one of the best trios in history play it in only the way masters can, this DVD is for you.",1207612800,,1632,4.689895470383275
7986513,5,B00008RH0Z,"Everything about this DVD is well above average - the players , the songs chosen , camerawork and the direction which is sensitive to the music .

It is a DVD that can either be watched or played with your TV switched off .

I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of trio jazz or jazz in general .

Players of any of the three instruments played here will be able to use it on an instructional basis also . Teachers could also use it as a reference for young jazz players as an example of superior playing and more importantly , musical communication .

I will enjoy it for years to come and hope others do the same .",1175126400,2,616,4.151260504201681
7986514,5,B00008RH0Z,"Are you browsing around to try to find the best DVD available for Keith Jarrett Trio as you are his long time audio-CD listener? Well, if you don't trust reviews here, at least you can trust Manfred Eicher - for this DVD is so far the only one I got that is also available as an ECM record.

If you like that CD, Tokyo Live '96, you should definitely get this DVD as it offers the whole concerts. Some of the tunes (such as Tonk, and a great prelude of All the Things that You Are) are as fine as those got selected on the album. Moreover, I am sure that the DVD will take you deeper into that CD with the visual images of communication between the players. A touching performance.",1140912000,4,681,4.159090909090909
