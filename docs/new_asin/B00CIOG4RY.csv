8582103,3,B00CIOG4RY,"This may or may not have appeal depending on what you're looking for. This is a simple flick to watch without anything complicated. You've got these women being hunted by a bunch of psychos. It's a SOV digital video movie, but they picked a really nice setting for it. The characters aren't  really interesting or anything like that. You just basically view the nice forest scenery and wait for the next nude scene or death. The main problem with it is that most of the death scenes consist of bloody gunshots. This was disappointing to me because I wanted more of a variety with the violence. They should've thrown in a lot of slashing with some extreme gore. However, it took a different root and becomes an action/horror flick that has a bit of too much gunshot deaths. Directing and pacing are OK, but it may get tedious at times to some. Personally, I think these action/horror flicks with gun play need a bigger budget to be effective, while the wood stalking slasher and monster gore flicks are fine many times with a really low-budget. Pamela Sutch is an older woman who provides a good amount of full nudity. She does most of the nudity, as well as providing the only full nude scenes. Aside from her, there's just some topless nudity. World Wide Multimedia released this in a multi pack; I didn't know that when I bought the disc individually.

The quality is very good.",1507161600,,1380,4.605691056910569
8582104,3,B00CIOG4RY,If you want a cheap T & A with bad acting and bad story this is it! Pamela Sutch is the only reason to buy this. If you like her you won't be disapointed!,1432512000,,154,3.5588235294117645
8582105,4,B00CIOG4RY,"Stars: Lisa Neeld( Playboy),  Sara Brooks (WWE) and Pamela Sutch ( B-movie Scream Icon).

In a Len Kabasinski film.

So, There is bidding for an opportunity to hunt down HUMANS, Evidently this is a regular event. Sheesh !

Was intrigued that some of the Bad Guy Hunters  were also women hunting other women,What does that tell usKind of deep thoughts for a B-Movie Right ?

The female leads are pretty impressive,Yes,PRETTY ,I mean we get to see alot of them physically displayed and yet they can hang with the boys in the violence department.

The stunts,gore scenes and sheer terror developed in the script was great.",1404086400,3,619,4.783018867924528
8582106,4,B00CIOG4RY,"The movie is low budget, and lacks some of the professional touches as far as sound, camera angles, and effects go.  However, for a low budget film it wasn't at all disappointing!  The story reminds me of a hybrid between Hostel and I Spit On Your Grave.  Some interesting twists were in the film.  Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",1382832000,5,329,4.433333333333334
8582107,3,B00CIOG4RY,"This is another film in which a professional hunting club, hunts scantily clad females. The film weighs in at 75 minutes. The DVD box claims special features, but my menu didn't have any. The film has bad herky-jerky camera angles, awkward close-ups with cut off heads and faces. The sound during the club meeting had a cheapness to it. On the plus side, the girl on the cover is in the film.

Four girls go camping on a get-away weekend, no cell reception, etc. etc. I think you got the picture.

F-bomb. No sex. Nudity (Lisa Neeld, Sara Brooks, Pamela Sutch, and did I mention Lisa Neeld?)",1378425600,4,591,4.514018691588785
8582108,2,B00CIOG4RY,"I give a star for landscape and forest scenery photography and a star for general plot and transitions...
I give a star for casting the female leads...but take it away because the killers seemed insufferably out of character...
I give a star for the soiree scene...but take it away because the hand to hand combat scenes were laughably bad...
caroline gets shot, buried, beat up, and still walks home???...
last but not least, any dvd without a scene selection feature is essentially a glorified version of a vhs tape...reissue it with that and ill give another star back to you",1377216000,3,578,4.79
