8574931,5,B004Q2MFVK,"Thanks to friends who forced me to learn, I now love scuba diving. The thing I like about it most is being able to take photos underwater. I'm always amazed at what the deep has been hiding. Anyways, every time I go scuba diving, I use the NEMO 200 to keep my camera nice and dry. I learned how to build one using the instructions on this dvd. This is a solid investment if you don't want to spend a lot of money on pro camera housing.",1317686400,,435,4.011494252873563
