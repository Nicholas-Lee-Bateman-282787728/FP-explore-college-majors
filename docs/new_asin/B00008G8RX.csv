7983302,4,B00008G8RX,"Having just purchased Blind Fist Of Bruce(Bruce Li) and watching it for the first time in over 15 years, I have to say that I was impressed. This is truly another one of Bruce Li's best flicks in that the fight choreography is on point, the acting is there, the plot is there, and the comedy makes this one a keeper(I don't recall any of Bruce Li's other flicks being this hialrious...funniest I've seen since Jackie Chan). On top of all that is the fact that Bruce Li(rather Ho Chuong Dao) is not attempting to pass for another Bruce Lee or as a successor.",1109030400,,557,4.365384615384615
