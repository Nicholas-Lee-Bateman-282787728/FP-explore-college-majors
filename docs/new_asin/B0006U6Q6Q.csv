2196218,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"This is Carlos Kleiber's Carmen. He is the star of the production, how sensational his interpretation is! Together with the brilliant orchestra and singers, he creates the definite Carmen for me. He just knows how to make the music come to life. How lucky we are that this performance has been documented and available to us all now.

Placido Domingo is at his prime, I guess he has never been better as Don Jose and Isobel Buchanan as Micaela is just stunning.

The second act - from 'Les tringles des sistres tintaient' to the flower aria , it just takes your breath away. Not only for opera lovers, anyone who doesn't know the opera, should start with this one. This version will show us what an opera is all about.",1103587200,28,718,4.515384615384615
2196219,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"Well, if it was possible to give 10 stars i would obviously give it.
The world-known, outstanding russian mezzo Elena Obraztsova is uncompareable in the role of Carmen. Sexy, seductive, mad, charming! Her voice is deep, dark and expressive. Franco Zeffirelli said the in the interview that there were only 3 women that impressed him in his life - Maria Callas, Anna Maniani and Elena Obraztsova. So here we have it. Just look at and listen to Habanera, Seguidilla, Gupsys song, card scene and final scene.
Placido Domingo is wonderful in the role of Don Jose. So passionate. And you really believe that he is mad on Carmen.
Yuri Mazurok, uncomparable russian bariton, gives Escamillio that makes you tremble.
And Karlos Kleiber gives the real Bizet.
Don't hesitate. This DVd is really worth.",1221091200,8,791,4.954887218045113

2196221,5,B0006U6Q6Q,Of course many different great artists made this production a great one but I decided to buy this DVD only because of Carlos Kleiber and I couldn't be happier.,1174953600,8,159,4.517241379310345
2196222,4,B0006U6Q6Q,Nice performance. Splendid Vienna opera. But Obraztsova is not vivid and young enough  for Carmen. This DVD is good for home classical collection.,1162857600,5,146,5.3478260869565215
2196223,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"The first time I saw Carmen was on this DVD and I was amazed.  The end almost brought me to tears.  I think the cast as a whole did a great job in this performance.  Pl?cido Domingo sounds great as usual, if not better; he really sings his heart out especially in the Flower Aria and at the very end.  And even though Elena Obraztsova may not be the best looking Carmen, though she's not bad, her singing is amazing and she has a very deep voice, and in an opera the singing's the most important in my opinion.  Besides, some of the cigarette/factory girls look pretty decent, and I thought Obraztsova's acting was good for the part too.  I think Yuri Mazurok was perfect for Escamillo, the Toreador and I think deserved applause after he sung the Toreador song (Votre Toast).  Isobel Buchanan (as Michaela) is also a great singer, she can really hit the high notes well and is flawless throughout the whole performance.  There is a lot going on in this performance and it's kind of busy with large amounts of people but I think it adds to the excitement of the opera.
I also have to say Carlos Kleiber and The Vienna State Opera orchestra go perfect together.  When Kleiber conducts, it seems to come so natural to him, he looks so relaxed and laidback during the quiet parts, and so energetic, conducting extremely fast during some other parts, and the outcome is great.  I will say, this opera and performance is one of those things where words can't describe it enough, you have to see for yourself.  So if you're looking for a Carmen to buy, buy this one and you won't be sorry.",1143763200,17,1583,4.442906574394463
2196224,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"Having recently reviewed the von Karajan film of Carmen, I was compelled to rewatch this production, which came out about the same time, in order to compare two very different versions of Bizet's masterwork, one of the greatest operas of all time. Having explored them both, it's hard for me to choose a favorite. This one has less of a ""name"" cast than the von Karajan, but that shouldn't be a deterrent, the cast here, though less well known, is scarcely less wonderful, and it features Placido Domingo, arguably the best Don Jose of modern times. Therefore, an educated decision is probably going to come down to a couple of factors. One, the von Karajan version is a film, this is a live performance of a Zefferelli production, so it depends on the viewer's preference. Two, the conductors have different styles: do you favor the languourous pace of von Karajan, or the speedy, headlong assault of Carlos Kleiber? Of course, if you are like me, you enjoy various approaches to the same work of art, and will want to buy them both!

The main but definitely not only selling point of this DVD is Domingo's Don Jose. We all know the tenor is a beautiful singer, even today, but when this was done in the late '70's he was in his prime, both physically and vocally. His Flower Aria is a literal showstopper. The audience must have been informed that the performance was being taped and instructed to save most of their applause for the curtain calls, because the crowd stays fairly sedate throughout most of the opera; Domingo's aria, however, inspires a nearly three minute ovation, and justifiably so,it is poignant, dramatic, heartbreaking, incomparable. I'm glad the editors didn't cut the applause, seeing it in its entirety adds to the live feel of this DVD. But that isn't Domingo's only moment in the sun, he excels at every level, deteriorating into obsession and madness; by the end of act three, he is positively frightening, telling Carmen that they are destined(some might say doomed) to meet again.

As Carmen, Elena Obraztsova is vocally superb, she has the sort of deep, throaty, occasionally masculine voice necessary to create a convincing gypsy seductress. Her acting is less consistent, she can't seem to decide whether to play Carmen as an insouciant flirt or a strong-willed woman of passion - she is far more effective as the latter. I'm not saying that the two qualities are mutually exclusive, but in her performance they seem to belong to two different characters. Not that her performance isn't highly watchable throughout - she has a nice laugh, even when she's trying to be cruel, and her large eyes are beautifully evocative, even haunting, in the manner of an old-time movie femme fatale(Dietrich in The Blue Angel, Crawford in Rain, Calamai in Ossessione). But when she is at her best, which means at her most passionate, she is truly unforgettable.

Isobel Buchanan is a perfect Micaela, young, lovely, ingenuous, full of pathos, with a sweetly moving voice capable of achieving great power during her big aria. Yuri Mazurok isn't the most strong-voiced Escamillo you will ever hear, his baritone sounds a little rough at times, but overall he has a good sound and is convincing as a cocky matador.

Kleiber's conducting is lightning quick, really the only time it takes a breather is during the prolonged audience ovation for Domingo's aria. This fast pace galvanizes the music while emphasizing that the primary motivation behind the story of Carmen is passion with a capital P. Zeffirelli's production has his usual panache, with great crowd scenes, colorful costumes, authentic-looking locales. My only complaint is with his TV direction, which too often bypasses wide shots in favor of medium shots and closeups - in my opinion, those wide shots, especially during crowd scenes, really give the viewer the feel of being there in the audience. Also, his choice of camera emphasis is occasionally ill-conceived, such as at the end of the Toreador Song, where Carmen sings ""L'amour"" to Escamillo and she isn't even in the frame. This is an important moment, and it has more of an impact if we actually see Carmen saying(singing) the words.

Two nearly perfect productions of Carmen on DVD. Bizet didn't live long enough to see or enjoy the success of his masterpiece, but the rest of us can bask in what the composer was unfortunately denied.",1143590400,35,4377,4.901484480431849
2196225,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"A lot of years have being waiting most of the opera lovers for this release of Bizet's Carmen conducted by the legendary Carlos Kleiber, with one of the top class orchestras and with a great vocal group. We knew this recording because it was released on CD some years ago, but I always wanted to watch it and much more better in a good classical scene like this.

What we can watch and listen here is a stage production of the wiener opera from the year 1978, a decade in which the Austrian orchestra was really in a very good moment, as many of the just released DVDs by DG show. It's a Wiener Philharmoniker full of energy and colour, electrifying and technically perfect, according to the person who is conducting them; the very enthusiastic and perfectionist Carlos Kleiber.

The vocal part have very inspiring singers. Of course not all give them best in every moment, something very difficult in a complex work like this. Anyway, between all of them I would like to mention Plcido Domingo, in a performance really wonderful and a little more passionate than his recording conducted by Claudio Abbado, which is a little cold sometimes, specially in the dialogues.

Zeffirelli makes a great work in a classical production, very interesting for those who listen and watch the opera for the first time, because they will understand much more better what is happening Some other reviewers have written about this, very, very good. Of course I would like a more modern stage design, but this is good enough.

The sound is not really good and it's the only weak point of this DVD. Even so, it's better than the CD released with the same version, apart from having the visual part.

I know some other Carmen versions, like Bernstein (DG), Abbado (DG) or Karajan (RCA), but this could be, nowadays, my favourite one, finally available for all the world on DVD. It will be hard to make a Carmen more passionate and electrifying than this.",1133308800,16,1934,4.6932153392330385
2196226,4,B0006U6Q6Q,"Afficianados the world over must surely be grateful for the release of this historic 1978 new production for Vienna.  The superb cast is headed by a vocally strong Obraztsova and clarion Domingo, with special merit to the Micaela of Isobel Bchanan.

  Kleiber (in one his rare forays into the opera pit) leads a brilliant reading, at times very fast, but thrilling always.  Zefirelli's production is over-the-top, and he's adept at pulling both nuanced performances from his principles and expertly managing the large crowd scenes.

  It's a minor pity, therefore, that the technical aspects of this DVD fall somewhat short.  Yes, it's a soon-to-be 30 year-old recording, but audio remastering hasn't altogether corrected a somewhat dull and shrill (at times) soundtrack.  It's not enough to get in the way, but does take away a star in my opinion.

Nonetheless, highly recommended.",1116720000,25,882,5.228571428571429
2196227,4,B0006U6Q6Q,"..3 out of 4 ain't bad.  Placido Domingo, Isobel Buchanan and Yuri Mazurok are all ideal in this unnecessarily bloated Zeffirelli production from 1979. Elena Obraztsova's Carmen, unfortunately, is not.  Or is she playing Carmen's mother?  OK, it's not that she's too old for the role -- Buchanan certainly isn't 16 -- but she's dumpy, matronly, and devoid of sex-appeal. This is a huge problem for ""Carmen."" To see Domingo and Mazurok single out Obraztsova as the most desirable woman on stage when they're surrounded by svelte, sexy young supernumeraries strains credulity, to say the least. Imagine your mother putting a flower in her hair and sashaying around for your high school friends and you'll have an idea of how silly and uncomfortable the performance looks. (And somebody please take away those castanets!)

And astoundingly, Zeffirelli has directed Obraztsova to play Carmen as a hooker with a heart of gold, a good-time gal with barely an ounce of guile or menace. Given her lack of charisma, the approach may be right for the singer, but it makes no sense whatsoever for the role.

To be fair, Obraztsova's singing is wonderful (despite some severe sharpness at the top of Act Two), and the card scene in Act Three, is masterfully played...but it's Eboli we see reading her own fortune, not Carmen.

The rest of the cast goes a long way toward making up for the hole in the middle of this production. A blond (!) Domingo, looking young and robust, is in superb voice. I think the 2 minute + ovation for the Flower Aria is a little much (particularly as there's no applause whatsoever for Mazurok's fine rendition of the Toreador song a few minutes earlier), but the performance is thrilling proof that Domingo is, in my opinion, the greatest male vocalist that opera's had in the past 50 years. Buchanan is a lovely Michaela. The sound is clean and clear, and her transformation from an innocent kid in Act One to a troubled young adult in Act Three is beautifully calibrated. Mazurok's Escamillo is exactly right for the role: a mixture of ego, slyness, raw courage -- and a strong, rich, nuanced baritone. The supporting cast is terrific all around, particularly Kurt Rydl's Zuniga and Cheryl Kanfoush and Axelle Gall as Carmen's female cronies.

The production, alas, is another Zeffirelli mishmash. This has bothered me less in the past (notably in his Met Puccini productions), but here there's just too much going on in too many scenes. A director's job is to help focus the audience on what's important on stage, not distract them with extraneous people and business. And to set Act Two out of doors when Zuniga has to sing about breaking down a door to get to Carmen and Jose is a gross disregard for the libretto.

A huge nod must go to the amazing Carlos Kleiber, who breathes new, magnificent life into this most familiar of operas. To watch him conduct is fascinating; sometimes he looks almost bored, at others as if his arms are going to fly off. And how wonderful the sounds those arms bring forth from the Vienna State Opera orchestra! Here's a conductor whose passion for music is palpable and infectious. Check out his ""Der Rosenkavalier"" with von Otter and Lott if you want to experience another example of his brilliance at conducting opera.",1114214400,29,3276,4.80639431616341
2196228,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"When this production of 'Carmen' was mounted at the Vienna State Opera in 1978 it caused quite a stir. Mostly that was because Carlos Kleiber rarely conducted opera and when he did it was always an occasion. And Zeffirelli, controversial but brilliant as an opera conductor, always created a stir with any new production of his. This film was also directed by Zeffirelli for Austrian television and as far as I know it has not been available in general circulation since its initial airing. It is a fitting tribute to Kleiber whose death this last summer was a blow for the classical music world. He was surely one of the great conductors of recent times.

Plcido Domingo is in his prime here as Don Jos. In Act II 'La fleur que tu m'avais jete' ('The Flower Song') is thrilling, even though he doesn't quite manage the pianissimo ending Bizet intended. There is a five-minute-plus ovation at its finish, and it is well-deserved. It is interesting that Zeffirelli left the entire ovation in his edited film because there are many other places in the performance where the applause has been edited out. One wonders if he wasn't playing favorites with his cast. Elena Obraztsova gets silence after several of her arias, but Isobel Buchanan gets a huge ovation after her Act III 'Je dis que rien ne m'epouvante,' again deservedly so. It is true that Obraztsova is not an ideal Carmen, at least in the early going when she is supposed to be the alluring, devil-may-care gypsy woman. Later, though, in the Card Scene where she repeatedly turns up cards that predict 'La mort!' ('Death!) she is riveting. Our Escamillo is, to my mind, rather a cipher. Yuri Mazurok has a solid baritone, but his torero does not have the necessary vocal or physical swagger, and his French is almost unintelligible. The minor characters are well-taken. I was particularly impressed both vocally and histrionically with the Frasquita (Cheryl Kanfoush) and Mercds (Axelle Gall), singers not previously known to me.

The undoubted star of this production is Carlos Kleiber. From the downbeat of the Prlude to the very end of the opera, his musical direction is as exciting as any I've ever heard in this thrice-familiar opera. Zeffirelli knew this, too. His camera focuses on Kleiber repeatedly throughout the production, sometimes even interrupting action onstage, but generally only when the orchestra is playing alone. I had never seen Kleiber conduct, so I was very pleased to be able to see this. (I was amused to see him give the opening tempo of those fast sixteenths at the beginning of the fourth act by mouthing to orchestra and chorus 'Puh puh Puh puh Puh puh' before giving the downbeat.) I can imagine others, less interested in the conductor, might feel that Zeffirelli's cutting away to show Kleiber is a distraction. The members of the Vienna Philharmonic play like gods. Their rhythmic precision is jaw-droppingly good. I'd particularly single out the concertmaster and the principal flute for praise.

This is one of those over-the-top Zeffirelli productions. There are huge numbers of people onstage much of the time and Zeffirelli's vaunted ability to direct crowds, giving each member some individual bits to perform, is on show here. The camerawork is such that at times one almost believes one is watching an opened-out movie of an opera, not one confined to a stage. I did think all the donkeys and horses in Act III were a bit much, but the crowd outside the bullring arena in Act IV (and featuring exciting flamenco dancers) was a great pleasure to watch.

The edition used here appears to be the one by Fritz Oeser, with spoken dialog and sans the Guiraud recitatives. That was something new in the 1970s and must have been interesting for seasoned operaphiles. I well remember a 1973 production at the Met conducted by Bernstein and starring Marilyn Horne that broke with precedent by using this new edition. I don't know if that one has made it to video.

Is this the definitive 'Carmen.' Well, first of course one would have to ask if there could ever be such a thing. Is it a good 'Carmen'? You bet it is! I do wish the Carmen had perhaps been a bit more alluring, but one cannot argue with that huge organ-toned mezzo of Obraztsova. And it's hard to imagine a better Don Jos. Isobel Buchanan's Micala is a tiny bit generic (as perhaps the part itself is), but lovely and appealing. Mazurok has his admirers, but I'm not particularly one of them. Still, this DVD rates five stars; it definitely is an occasion and an exciting one. Interestingly there is another Zeffirelli production from Verona on DVD that I like almost as much as this one, even though the cast is a whole lot less famous, but its orchestra is nowhere near as good.

Visually this is stunning and in crisp videography. Sound is clear and in plain vanilla stereo, no options. Subtitles in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish.

Recommended with minor reservations.

8043368,4,B0006U6Q6Q,"Having just been very impressed with the Met's 2010 ""Carmen"" with Garanca and Alagna, I thought I would check out this one too.  It's from 1978, at the Vienna Staatsoper, with Carlos Kleiber conducting, and that last fact made it quite an occasion at the time.  I strongly recommend it too, and the following comments indicate differences between it and the 2010 Met production.  I have heard good things about an earlier Met production with Carreras, Baltsa, and Levine, so I might have to get that one too!

1.  The Met production has a much clearer emotional and narrative arc, and the director, Richard Eyre, asked for (and got) a lot of detailed acting from his singers.  A sense of danger is present from the start, and it grows or deepens as the opera goes on.  Zeffirelli, the director of the 1978 production, is much more into spectacle, and the idea of consistent characterization goes by the board.  An exception is Domingo's Don Jose, and I'm betting that HIS emotional arc is owed to his dramatic intelligence rather than to anything his director required.  Domingo gives a great performance, musically and dramatically, reaching an Otello-like intensity in places,including, of course, the final scene.

2. Obraztsova hasn't a consistent take on Carmen, as Garanca does; only perhaps in response to the Flower Song does she seem moved by Don Jose's declaration, and then, of course, she has to turn on him in scorn.  Eyre's conception for Garanca makes more sense, for Carmen's real interest in Jose has been manifest from the beginning, entailing her rejection of Zuniga.  The whole Zuniga-Jose rivalry doesn't figure at all in the 1978 production, where Act 1 is played pretty much as comedy, with no undercurrent of threat, especially masculine threat to women, which is palpable in the Met production.

3.  It follows, then, that this production works from scene to scene, rather than building.  And there's plenty to enjoy in the scenes.  That's largely due to Kleiber, who drives the ensembles with terrific elan.  Act 2 is a highlight of the Met production, and it is here too for completely different reasons.  It has a number of ensembles, including choral work, and Kleiber gives enormously enlivening accounts of them.  Add to that consistently fine singing -- leaving issues of character aside -- and what's not to like?  Kleiber's conducting alone is a good reason to own this DVD.  There's nothing wrong with Nezet-Seguin's conducting for the Met, but Kleiber is just something special.

4. The supporting singers are very good.  Mazurok is much more secure, especially at the top of his voice, than Tahu Rhodes in the Met account, and though his French is poor, the spirit is right, and he looks good.  Isobel Buchanan is an excellent Micaela, singing as well as Frittoli and looking the right age.  Kurt Rydl is a sonorous Zuniga, though (not his fault) he's made into almost a comic figure here.

5.  Then there's the issue of the voices.  Domingo and Obraztsova have much larger voices than their Met counterparts, so they generate a different kind of excitement.  Obraztsova has a huge voice, with more colors than Garanca, if not so beautiful -- though she can do beautiful too.  It's a ""force of nature"" kind of voice that arguably makes sense for Carmen.  So even when you think that she's making standard operatic gestures (as she does even in the final scene), the singing is something to hear.  Domingo doesn't make standard operatic gestures.  He sings to his partner(s) as the situation demands, and the voice is simply wonderful in its own right too.  That enables him to communicate a degree of intensity that is beyond Alagna's means, fine though the latter is.  The principals' vocal endowments are the other reason to get this DVD -- though be warned: the sound recording doesn't always do them justice and some allowances are needed.

6.  Although Zeffirelli doesn't take the long view as a director, his stage pictures always look good, and although some people complain of his crowding on stage, surely ""Carmen"" is an opera that can take it.  The six or so horses in the final act are just the icing on the cake.",1426204800,,4161,4.849645390070922

The cast standing on the edge of the stage looking out at the audience doesn't make it. All the girls and the men in the first act stood around preening like sex was the only thing on their minds.

The production design and direction are not very good. Zefferelli has far too many people milling around and being busy during the crowd scenes. It looks like a production of War and Peace instead of Carmen. And why did they keep cutting to Kleiber in the middle of the arias? That was poor camera work. I appreciate him being recognized between acts and at the beginning and the ending. He was a great conductor. But in the middle of arias? No. Because of the brilliant performances, I give the dvd four stars. A better production is the Baltsa, Carreras, Levine, Metropolitan Opera production. Baltsa is the greatest Carmen on video. Both her singing and her acting are superb. Carreras is wonderful as Don Jose. Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus are wonderful. And the production is staged very well.

8043372,2,B0006U6Q6Q,"Why claustrophia? TDK, usually an excellent producer of videos, unfortunately chose to display this production with blank white sidebars bracketing its 4:3 picture format on my widescreen monitor; thus, one's POV is akin to watching the world with blinders on. And what a world- wonderful sets and costumes by Franco Zefirelli. Unfortunately however, Franco frantically directs hyper-frantically to say the least. The entire stage is often packed with chorus and supernumeraries moving about and gesturing as if they had just each consumed 12 cups of strong coffee laced with metamphetamine. So there: a very disconcerting clautrophobic 'Francoticismic' experience; almost makes one wish that Don Jose chose the viewer for his victim.
Carmen as depicted in Bizet's opera is an enticer of men, tres-tres sexy; unfortunately Elena Obraztsova is neither. Isobel Buchana, Micaela,is O.K.
Placido Domingo, Don Jose, is excellent. Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna Staatsopera Orchestra are wonderful. The picture sharpness is excellent as is the sound(in LPCM Stereo format only, however). The two stars are for these latter performers.

8043373,5,B0006U6Q6Q,"Fail at the premiere and after the taste of the public is not new in the world of opera. La Traviata, Madama Butterfly, La Forza Del Carmen destination and are classic examples. The Carmen more displeased by the characters that the music itself. The public of the second half of the nineteenth century was not prepared to see a gypsy free, independent and conquering the stage. Women smoking, smuggling, desertion and fighting contributed to the failure of the premiere. This fact shows that the opera was far ahead of its time.

The twentieth century brought an air of modernity and Carmen is set in the repertoire of all the major theaters. Its catchy tune, warm Mediterranean made the opera to be the darling of the public, selling out theaters and buying recordings made her a success.

When mounting Carmen is confronted with a problem, which edition to use. This writes that you have 14 versions of video and none is equal to another. Some have dialogues that characterize the French comic opera, others have recitatives and there are hybrids, with both characteristics. The version reviewed here belongs to the hybrid.

Difficult to analyze the direction of Carlos Kleiber. The enigmatic conductor that little region and was averse to recording shows that you know make the most of an excellent orchestra. His unique style of governing behind a particular color, especially for precision instruments. His time is perfect, quick or dramatic as needed. Giving the fluency score and making nice to the ears. A masterpiece of conducting.

Franco Zeffirelli is an acclaimed Italian director, in this work he shows all his artistic talents. Without innovations and much creativity reveals various facets of the characters through movement and theatrical gestures. Domain camera and exact phrase make the viewer feel the thrill of being watching the opera live.

The pastel prevails in scenery and costumes in the first act, the red in the second, the dark and pastel in the third again at last. All in keeping with the libretto, Sevilla will remember the time. Modern after 26 years of his view.

Plcido Domingo is inspired by that night. Can you beat up your weakness, the treble. All are there. Performance scenic impeccable, always an excellent actor, Don Jose is a sustained and jealous. The aria La fleur that you m'avais Jete is the highlight of the night, drama rarely seen on stage. Domingo's voice was peaking in the 70s.

Obraztsova possessing beautiful tone, perfect to embody and rebel gypsy. Besides voice dark and bulky shows a scenic performance right. Ask the highs a little shrill. Sometimes glib, cynical, stubborn and passionate shows us the many facets of the character. All with great ease making their exciting performance. An unforgettable Carmen.

The weakness among the soloists is on behalf of Mazurok Yuri, baritone voice ocher, dull and unsuitable for the bullfighter Escamila. It transmits the force necessary for a character that has attributes such as courage and bravery. His music is simple and powerful at the opera, her voice does not fit these characteristics.

Micaela's character represents the beginning of the opera to youth, purity and innocence. Isabel Buchanan can express these feelings, the voice, the physical type and acting. Micaela makes a good girl, sweet and in love with Don Jose. His lyrical voice with bright treble is perfectly adequate. Strength gains in the third act, when he has to show all their courage in seeking to don Jose among the smugglers. Naivety to maturity makes the evolutionary path of the human person.

Seal TDK has become known for its titles in exquisite quality soloists, image and sound. In this opera we have a recording of 1978, implemented analog to digital. The quality of sound and image are median compared to recent releases with digital matrix. But this is one small detail on the richness of the costumes, regency monumental Carlos Kleiber, direction copy of Zeffirelli, exquisite performance of Plcido Domingo and Elena Obraztsova. A Carmen serves as a historical reference to any visitor to the richness of this opera

Carmen, pera popular

Fracassar na estria e depois cair no gosto do pblico no  uma novidade no mundo da pera. La Traviata, Madama Butterfly  , La Forza Del destino e Carmen so exemplos clssicos.  A Carmen desagradou mais pelos personagens que pela msica em si. O pblico da segunda metade do sculo XIX no estava preparado para ver uma cigana livre , independente e conquistadora no palco. Mulheres fumando, contrabandistas, desero e brigas  contriburam para o fracasso da estria. Fato esse demonstra que a pera estava muito a frente de seu tempo.

  O sculo XX trouxe ares de modernidade e a Carmen se fixou no repertrio de todos os grandes teatros . Sua msica envolvente, quente e mediterrnea fez  a pera ser a mais querida do pblico, que  lotando teatros e comprando gravaes fez dela um sucesso.

  Ao montar Carmen depara-se com um problema, que edio usar. Esse que vos escreve tem 14 verses em vdeo e nenhuma  igual a outra. Algumas possuem os dilogos que caracterizam a opera comic francesa, outras possuem recitativos e existem as hbridas, com as duas caractersticas. A verso aqui analisada pertence as hbridas.

  Difcil analisar a regncia de Carlos Kleiber. O enigmtico maestro que pouco regia e era avesso a gravaes mostra que sabe tirar o mximo de uma excelente orquestra. Seu jeito nico de reger trs um colorido especial, com destaque para a preciso nos instrumentos . Seus tempos so perfeitos, rpidos ou dramticos quando necessrio. Dando fluncia a partitura e a tornando agradvel aos ouvidos.  Uma obra prima de regncia.

  Franco Zeffirelli  um aclamado diretor italiano, nessa obra ele mostra todos seus dotes artsticos. Sem inovaes e com muita criatividade nos revela vrias facetas dos personagens atravs de movimentao cnica e gestual.  Domnio de cmera e locues exatas fazem o espectador sentir a emoo de estar assistindo a pera ao vivo.

  O tom pastel prevalece nos cenrio e figurino no primeiro ato, o vermelho no segundo , o escuro no terceiro e o pastel novamente no ltimo. Tudo condizente com o libreto,  lembrando  Sevilha da poca. Moderno aps 26 anos de sua exibio.

  Plcido Domingo est inspirado nessa noite. Consegue at vencer seu ponto fraco, os agudos. Todos esto l . Atuao cnica impecvel, sempre um excelente ator,  faz um Don Jose sofrido e enciumado. A ria La fleur que tu m'avais jete  o ponto alto da noite, dramaticidade poucas vezes vista em palco. A voz de Domingo estava no auge nos anos 70.

  Obraztsova possu belo timbre , ideal para encarnar e cigana rebelde. Alm da voz escura e volumosa mostra uma atuao cnica correta. Peca nos agudos um pouco estridentes. As vezes volvel , cnica, teimosa e apaixonante nos mostra as inmeras facetas da personagem . Tudo com grande desenvoltura tornando emocionante sua atuao. Uma Carmen inesquecvel.

  O ponto fraco entre os solistas fica por conta de Yuri Mazurok, bartono de voz ocre , sem brilho e inapta para o toureiro Escamilo. No transmite a fora necessria a um personagem que tem como atributos a coragem e a valentia. Sua msica  simples e vigorosa na pera, sua voz no se adapta a essas caractersticas.

  A personagem de Micaela representa no incio da pera a juventude , a pureza e a inocncia. Isabel Buchanan consegue expressar esses sentimentos , na voz , no tipo fsico e na atuao. Faz de Micaela uma boa moa,  doce  e apaixonada por Don Jose. Sua voz lrica com agudos brilhantes  perfeitamente adequada. Ganha fora no terceiro ato, quando tem que demonstrar toda sua coragem ao procurar don Jose entre os contrabandistas. Da ingenuidade para a maturidade perfaz o caminho evolutivo da pessoa humana.

  O selo TDK tem se destacado por lanar ttulos de qualidade primorosa em solistas, imagem e som. Nessa pera temos uma gravao de 1978, analgica transposta para o digital. A qualidade do som e imagem ficam medianos se comparados aos recentes lanamentos com matriz digital. Mas este  um pequeno detalhe diante da riqueza dos figurinos , regncia monumental de Carlos Kleiber , direo exemplar do Zeffirelli, atuao primorosa de Plcido Domingo e Elena Obraztsova. Uma Carmen histrica que serve de referncia a quem quer conhecer a riqueza dessa pera.
