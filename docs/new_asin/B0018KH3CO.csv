But what you do get, is a mind boggling visual display of ball handling, juggling, and dribbling skills performed by young adults on the streets of Brazil, entertaining to watch, but not very useful in competitive soccer.

Its eye candy for the soccer enthusiast who has played the game and knows how difficult it is to perform some of these skills.  How many ""mistakes"" were left on the cutting room floor by the video editors, we'll never know.  But who cares.",1222905600,,655,4.603448275862069
8269880,1,B0018KH3CO,This is a compilation of people playing football. Shots on the beach or on play courts with music on the background. It is not a documentary with comments that inform the viewer. A real disappointment that is not worth the money. I feel I have been misled by the description. I regret I wasted my money.,1217980800,,303,4.428571428571429
