5675923,5,B00BUQ141W,Caught it at Comi Con. Unbelievable!!  Don't miss it.  Great story and great animation. This one is a real treat for true horror fans.,1368057600,2,134,4.541666666666667
5675924,5,B00BUQ141W,Loved the original idea of a zombie with morals! It's different from the same old story of killer zombies. The art work was amazing !,1367020800,2,133,4.36
5675925,4,B00BUQ141W,"zombies are by far my favorite thing right now. anywhere from comic books to tv shows to movies, i watch and read everything zombies. when i was at the store a few night ago, i spotted this film in a movie rental machine. unsure of the film, i came home and opened up a few sites to learn more about the film. what i really enjoyed was the trailer. seeing the animations and how creative the film looked, is what really caught my eye. then i did some more digging and found out it was based off of a comic book. i was hooked. i watched the film and wow, just wow. i was taken for surprise. for a film that didn't get much promotion, whoever made it, did a good job and paid attention to details. i highly recommend it. its a good watch and has some humor. don't let the rating fool you. great movie.",1372636800,,799,4.095541401273885
5675926,4,B00BUQ141W,The living corpse makes his blu ray debut and man was it a fun one. If you like the comics and if you even don't you will enjoy this movie. It's fun and great to see how the one and only living corpse comes to be our gatekeeper of this world. So I would defiantly recommend atheist a rent but if your a fan of buz and ken the creators of the book then this is hands down a must buy.,1371859200,,382,3.728395061728395
5675927,5,B00BUQ141W,Highly recommended to any person interested in a kick ass animated film. The violence is not that intense as an R rating is led to believe. Great story and visuals. Cool score and wicked end credit song. Based on an awesome graphic novel The Living Corpse by Ken Haeser and Buz Hasson. I have three kids that were able to enjoy the movie (4-7) and they were not bothered by it one bit. It's animated and resembles a video game in some instances. This is why I'm puzzled by an R rating. Still highly recommended if you want an enjoyable movie. It comes with a digital copy of the newest Living Corpse book as well. What a value!,1371859200,,627,4.322033898305085
5675928,4,B00BUQ141W,"I should start off by saying I am a pretty big fan of the Comics this is based on, so i may be a tad Biased.

As we go forward please bare the following in mind. This is an indy film, with a small budget based on an Indy Comic that is kept alive by it's devoted creators and equally devoted Fans.

What this is is a Fun, and original CG animated movie. It's something we haven't seen before. It's not the same played out tired zombie story lines we have been seeing since Romero first pioneered the sub genre.

Is this film slightly flawed? Yes. Does that mean it sucks? Hell no.  Early in the film we're subjected to a less than perfect Shakey Cam effect that can be hard on the eyes, and the sound engineering was a but sparse. None of this stopped me from enjoying the film. My Only suggestion would have been to divide this into two episodes. as the story has two very specific arcs.

My recommendation - if you are  a fan of the Comics, or just original Horror, give it a shot.

One side note.. the film is rated R... but is actually pretty tame.. there is some gun violence and some VERY mild gore. I'd let my kid watch it.",1371686400,,1129,4.127853881278539
5675929,1,B00BUQ141W,"The animation is so basic that it doesn't lend itself to action sequences with the zombie hero.  It also takes away from being absorbed in any way with this particular graphic novel's storyline.  Reading the other initial reviewer's positive comments, I decided to give this one an early shot.  What a waste!  Save your money.  This one's a pass.  Sorry.",1371600000,,354,4.816666666666666
5675930,2,B00BUQ141W,"Tyler's father seeks revenge against the living and the dead after he is re-animated by a seedy corporation in THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF THE LIVING CORPSE. Justin Paul Ritter directs based on the popular Independent comic series, which may have been better left on the page rather than on screen. The clean and crisp stylings that Buz Hasson brought to the original illustrations are lost due to the tight restrictions of working in low-budget computerization. As a result, the animated feature looks like it has stepped out of the cut-scenes of a 1990's computer game. Ritter makes a few ambitious attempts with the settings and action sequences, but overall, the story and characters are as unengaging as the visuals. THE LIVING CORPSE should remain buried in the back-issues of your local comic store.

5675931,5,B00BUQ141W,I'm a big fan of the graphic novel and it was awesome to see Ken and Buz's work pay off on the big screen. The story is a great spin on the zombie genre which needed some new blood (and brains). Loved it!,1371168000,,204,3.7674418604651163

 The Next Series production stared 2 day ago....and the story is quit incredible.
Also in the back of the Living Corpse Comic, will feature an Edgar Allan the comic short by Keith Thomas & Blair Smith.",1371168000,,578,9.321428571428571
5675933,5,B00BUQ141W,"Very creative, very imaginative, and mostly VERY ORIGINAL!  Here's a mean and vicious zombie that's on OUR side!  Call him a zombie superhero, if you will!  Very fast-paced action, with a ""human"" storyline!  Touching and emotional in some scenes, as this isn't just about blood and guts.  This premiered at San Diego Comic Con to a standing-room-only crowd, with a standing ovation at the end of it.  If you think you've seen every zombie incarnation there is to see, you haven't seen The Living Corpse yet!",1368576000,3,507,4.837209302325581
5675934,5,B00BUQ141W,A Zombie Superhero with some great 3D effects is a great new take . I  Cought it at Comic Con and getting in on Blue Ray.  It a fun time Enjoy.  The voice acting is just great and the characters are fun to watch .,1368576000,,213,3.688888888888889
8574126,5,B00BUQ141W,I animated a number of scenes and some modeling for this film.  Of course I love it!,1469491200,,84,3.9411764705882355

8574129,1,B00BUQ141W,BBad voice acting bad animation slow story just simply a waste of time in everyway everything about this movie sux for the most part horrible voice acting and horrible animation combine to ruin any hope for entertainment,1384387200,,220,4.972972972972973
8574130,5,B00BUQ141W,"Being a huge fan of horror films, I never thought an animated horror film would bring such suspense and thrill.  I definitely recommend this one for any horror movie fans out there!",1373932800,,181,4.65625
8574131,4,B00BUQ141W,I watched this on a recommendation from a friend and wasn't disappointed. Granted it's not the best Zombie flick I've ever seen but I really liked that it was a new take on the genre.  I'm glad somebody actually made a zombie the hero for once.  It is animated which might put some people off but I think it gave the makers a little more creative license.  I gave it 4 stars for the effort.,1373760000,,390,4.173333333333333
8574132,2,B00BUQ141W,"Taylor's family is killed by zombies. His dad is a zombie who develops a conscience and rescues his son from those other zombies. Dad goes to the underworld while Taylor is sent off to a special school where he is bullied. The film consists mostly of zombie dad rescuing his son and fighting all kinds of monsters.

The film is entirely in comic book style animation and looks like it would make for a decent video game, except where does one go when one dies in hell? Detroit?

I got very bored after 30 minutes. While rated ""R"" for violence, the film's real appeal is with those too young to see it.

8574133,5,B00BUQ141W,"Being a huge fan of the comic I had to watch this movie, and to be honest I really enjoyed every bit of it. It has a great story and an awesome sound track during the
fighting scenes. Great job guys!",1372982400,,199,3.8780487804878048
8574134,5,B00BUQ141W,The animation is awesome.  The story is easy to follow.  I really don't understand the R rating.  I've seen more violence in some Saturday morning cartoons.  I think this is perfect for families that watch The Walking Dead together and are looking for something to fill the gap before new episodes start.,1372723200,,304,4.788461538461538
8574135,4,B00BUQ141W,"I really like the Amazing Adventures of The Living Corpse, while not big budget Pixar movie, I found it fun, campy and cool.  I later learned it was based on a little known comic book character of the same name.  I recommend this film for
comic book and zombie fans.  The comic book creators are very artistic, check out their Facebook artwork as well.  It's amazing too.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Adventures-of-the-Living-Corpse-Blu-ray/dp/B00BUQ13Y0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Adventures of the Living Corpse [Blu-ray</a>] [...]",1372636800,3,603,6.6923076923076925
