1082620,3,6305842000,"While watching The Bat (1959) last night, I couldn't help notice a strong sense of familiarity developing as the story unfolded.  I soon realized that I was watching a remake of the 1930 film The Bat Whispers, which I viewed and reviewed awhile back. Both films are based on a popular play written by Avery Hopwood and Mary Roberts Rinehart.  Also, there is an earlier version, one, which I haven't seen yet, released in 1926, also titled The Bat.
This version, adapted and directed by accomplished writer/director/actor Wilbur Crane, stars the venerable Vincent Price as Dr. Malcolm Wells and Agnes Moorehead as Cornelia Van Gorder (every time I heard some pronounce the that character's last name, I always heard it as Van Goiter, which made me think of a hideous growth caused by swelling of the thyroid gland and iodine deficiencies, but I digress).  Also appearing in the film is actress Darla Hood, who began her career at a very young age appearing in the Hal Roach Our Gang shorts, sometimes known as The Little Rascals, as a character named Darla, the apple of Alfalfa's eye.
The gist of the story is there's a large sum of money stolen from a local bank and hidden within a rather large, isolated house, and a killer, named The Bat, is on the loose, stopping at nothing, not even murder, to recovering the dough.  Yes, it's all about the money...Moorehead's character Ms. Van Gorder, is a famous mystery writer who rents a house for the summer, a house with a reputation of spookiness, but soon lives up to the reputation as the bodies literally begin to pile up.  Normally about this point in my reviews I break into a synopsis of the film, but doing that here would effectively destroy elements of the mystery, which I want to avoid.  Instead I'll just speak to the elements of the story I liked, disliked, and general impressions overall, of the film and this particular release.
What I liked about the film was the choice of Price and Moorehead to star in the movie.  They are both wonderful, breathing a great deal of life into the proceedings, despite some rather wooden performances by some of the other actors.  Crane took a number of liberties with the storyline, giving more emphasis to the characters of Ms. Van Gorder and Dr. Wells, presumably due to the big name stars playing the roles.  I mean if you're going to feature stars of that caliber, you should make use of them, right?  Another major change was drawing the story out over several nights, rather than having it all happen in one night.  This element didn't work for me, as it only served to dilute the story and disrupt the flow.  Some plot points seemed odd, like providing details for the bank robbery at the beginning, as we quickly learn who stole the money, and what that person's intentions for how they plan to get away with their crime.  This was obviously done to set up the motive for one of the many suspects within the film.  And that's another thing, the development of the suspects was so very clunky at times...instead of letting the clues develop and appear within the context of the story, allowing the viewer to feel as if they've stumble on something, here they are forced on us, abruptly, sticking out like sore thumbs.  The presentation is as about as subtle as getting hit with a sledgehammer.  And what would a mystery be without red herrings?  Well, here, not much, as they became painfully obvious as the story progressed.  They might as well have had the characters wearing sandwich boards proclaiming the fact.  Another element played up for no other reason than to add a level of lurid fascination was that of the Bat being a vicious murderer, ripping the throats out of various victims.  Overall, the whole production seemed to be presented to the audience in a patronizing way, like we wouldn't have the intelligence to discern the plot elements based on an inherit amount of intuition I feel most adults have, so everything was laid out in such a way as to require the least amount of thought from the audience.  As far as the final scenes where the killer/thief is finally revealed, well, I had it figured out about halfway through, so it really wasn't a big surprise.  In fact, the obviousness of the false suspects peppered throughout virtually guaranteed one with a basic amount of intelligence (even me) to be able to identify the culprit.  One last note, after the less than explosive revelation of the identity of The Bat, you'll be left with a lot hanging plot threads, ones the director never had any intention of resolving, and were presented only to further the story in some ridiculous fashion.
Despite my negative comments, I did enjoy certain elements...the comic relief in the form of Ms. Van Gorder's maid, Lizzie (played by Lenita Lane) survives nicely, and despite a bit of toning down from the 1930's version, and Price and Moorehead are fun to watch.  I did notice that in the 30's version, the house was much darker and atmospheric, actually becoming a character within the film.  Not as much emphasis seemed to be applied to that aspect in this film, the house serving a more utilitarian purpose of providing a background with not a lot of charm, comparatively speaking.
The quality of the print on this Anchor Bay Entertainment release looks sharp, although I felt the audio was a bit soft.  There are numerous releases of this film by different companies, all of varying degrees of quality, so it would be beneficial to potential buyers interested in this film to be wary of which release they decide to purchase.  As far as special features are concerned, there is a theatrical trailer for the film, but that's it.

1082621,5,6305842000,"Agnes Moorehead {known as ""Endora"" forever because of the TV show Bewitched, 1964-1972} was at one time a much sought after radio actress and appeared in MANY radio dramas of the '40s and '50s. ""The Bat"" fits Moorehead like a glove, utilizing her vocal range: she can go from calm and rational to hyper and irrational all in one breath depending on the situation. She plays a mystery writer and while staying at a huge house, a throat slashing killer is on the loose. Vincent Price, top billed but is really a co-star to Agnes, is drawn into the story 20 or so minutes into the film. With a bat like killer on the loose, everyone's tempers are at a high. at one point in the film Price is accused of being the killer! later, Price himself discovers the bat's identity and at gun-point tries to get the killer to turn himself in...but that isn't about to happen and Price's character is killed off, leaving Agnes and crew to solve the baffling case and you'll be surprised or not so surprised at who the bat really is.

Agnes Moorehead, as always, is just perfect in her role here as a mystery writer who rents an old, creaky mansion, which comes complete with invading bats and a fortune in hidden loot!
""The Bat"" has the ""feel"" (to me anyway) of a William Castle picture. Although this one is not a Castle creation. It was directed by Crane Wilber.

1082625,3,6305842000,"They brushed the dust off the creaky old Mary Roberts Rinehart story, and produced this minor league suspense flick at Allied Artists. No doubt, Vincent Price had marquee value, but his role is of lesser note in the plot. Agnes Moorehead dominates the movie. She leases the spooky old mansion and murder follows. Moorehead was in her pre-Endora glory in this flick. As mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder, she is by turns comic and abrasive. Overacting is plentiful. As Moorehad wanders the mansion on the night of the murder, she wears diaphanous sleepwear and displays some surprising decolletage. The heaving bosoms at Hammer Films have nothing on old Agnes. Some of the other casting is just as quirky. Darla Hood, of all people, shows up in an adult role long enough to get bumped off by The Bat. She would have been better off hanging out with Spanky and Alfalfa down at the old clubhouse. Gavin Gordon (Lord Byron in ""Bride of Frankenstein"" prologue) plays the hapless police inspector. Lizze Allen (Lenita Lane, if it matters), Cornelia's housekeeper, goes around calling her ""Miss Corny"" amidst double negatives. There is a lot of screaming on dark and stormy nights. The Bat prowls around in a fedora, dark head mask, and wearing gloves with steel claws. Necks are crushed and then lacerated. This was years before mad slasher flicks. This flick shows some early potential, but eventually settles back into a so-so low budget mystery thriller. From this point, you are on your own. ;-)",1035504000,17,1494,4.909090909090909

It starts at The Oaks, a huge mansion near the sea, that was rented for the summer. Her servants are uneasy, they heard about the murders that occurred earlier. It was blamed on The Bat, an unknown killer. Miss Van Gorter rushes to the bank, it is owned by a banker who vacations in the North Woods. Van Gorter writes popular murder mysteries. She is told the bank keeps $350,000 in bonds in their vault, but they are missing! The vacationing bank owner tells his Doctor about his embezzlement! Who will take the blame? Its the Cashier who will be blamed. The banker wants to create an unidentifiable body as his own so he can disappear with over a million dollars! [These figures date to the 1920s when an average income was less than $500.] Its an offer the Doctor cant refuse! But the woods are on fire, can they get away? Yes. Elsewhere a storm threatens that mansion. Victor Bailey the VP was arrested and charged with the theft. Van Gorters servants left as they were scared.

They learn The Bat killed two women! Noise scares Van Gorter and her assistant. A hand with claws is thrust through a window! Van Gorter calls the police for help, then locks themselves into a room. A man without a face enters the house! I have a gun and I know how to use it. A bat flies into their room. Elsewhere a man tests a bat. Dr. Wells leaves to go to The Oaks. A man enters his office after he leaves on a house call. Dr. Wells treats the maid, there seems to be no problem. That house has seen earlier tragedies. Mark Fleming is the heir, but he didn't get any money from Uncle John. Van Gorter hired new servants. Where could that money be hidden? Is there a floor plan to the house? Maybe. A man enters the house and begins searching. Is there another man outside? The women find a mans body inside! Dr. Wells is called and identifies Mark Fleming! Warner the driver arrives and is questioned. The Bat could be anybody says Lt. Anderson.

Lt. Andy searches the inside of the house then goes outside. The man without a face enters the house and disconnects the telephone, then searches an empty room. The women hear the noise from hammering. They cant use the telephone! Dale and her friend Judy Hollander search the house. Judy is attacked! Lt. Andy shows up. Where is Werner? Does he have a past? Another case for the Coroner. Dr. Wells shows up, he had an accident. Van Gorter searches that empty room. Elsewhere Dr. Wells finds the man without a face, there is a struggle and a shot! Somethings wrong says the maid. Mrs. Davenport is asleep! Where is Miss Cornelia? They find her! The garage is on fire! That masked man returns, he shoots at the women but is shot in return. The identification of The Bat is revealed!

This screenplay is by Crane Wilbur, based on the Wagenhals-Kemper play from the famous 1920s novel by Mary Roberts Rinehart. It is more or less faithful to the novel, so you won't be surprised by the ending. A few years later Agatha Christie wrote The Murder of Roger Ackroyd which has a similar plot. This has a good story with a lower budget and is entertaining today. Do parts seem implausible? It reflects the times of the 1920s. Does it question authority figures? You won't see a story like this on TV today! Note the familiarity with firearms (this story was written in the 1920s when Second Amendment rights were respected and un-infringed).",1477094400,,3387,4.484602917341977

1082765,4,6305842000,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Yet another movie that has fallen prey to poor copies released by numerous companies since it fell into public domain titles is saved by The Film Detective. While perhaps not the greatest film ever made it does offer an evenings worth of entertainment that all ages can watch leaving children with a bit of dread and adults with a chuckle or two.

Agnes Moorehead, just before her stint as Endora in the popular TV series BEWITCHED, stars as mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder who has just rented a country home known as The Oaks in a small town where her celebrity status is well known. Her constant companion Lizzie tells her that the house is supposed to be filled with mystery, enough so that the servants eventually all leave save two. At the same time a local killer has returned to wreak havoc on the town, a killer who leaves no trace and is known only as The Bat.

While this is going on the local bank president has gone on a hunting trip with his trusted friend Dr. Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price). There he reveals that he is responsible for embezzling $1 million dollars from the bank and is willing to split it with Wells if he will simply help him with killing a local guide and passing the body off as his own. Apparently Wells isn't as good a friend as he thinks since he kills him first but not before finding out with certainty where the money is hidden in his home, The Oaks.

After returning home Wells is contacted when Lizzie is bitten by an actual bat inside of the house and fearful she might get the rabies. This gives Wells an excuse to visit the house and perhaps a chance to find the hidden stolen loot. But his plans go wrong when The Bat himself, the person responsible for releasing the actual bat into the house, continues to visit the home as well.

Local police chief Lt. Any Anderson is called out and sets up an officer to keep an eye on the house. The Bat eluded him once before and he doesnt intend to let him slip through his fingers again. The suspects are plentiful from Wells to the houses chauffer turned butler Warner. The clues are there but never certain enough to identify just who The Bat is and why hes returned. All comes to a finale when Cornelia invites over several friends to help her piece the puzzle together. But can they survive another night of The Bat?

Based on the novel THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE by mystery writer Mary Roberts Rinehart, this was the fourth time the book had been adapted for the screen. The film itself is definitely of the low budget variety and every scene is definitely shot on soundstages, including outdoor sequences. There is little doubt in my mind that many of the sets used in this film weren't made just for this movie but probably reused in countless other films as well.

Perhaps what makes this movie stand out is the caliber of the actors involved here. Price had played as a leading man in many films prior to his stint as horror film icon. This was made just after his turns in THE FLY, THE TINGLER and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL but before his memorable performances in the Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films. Moorhead had begun as an actress in the Orson Welles films like CITIZEN KANE and THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSON before a long career in series television. Both add to the production here.

While a bit over the top in some ways the film does offer a solid mystery to be solved and one that isn't quite so obvious in its conclusion. To my knowledge it is also the first time the film has been offered on blu-ray. The Film Detective has once more brought forth the best quality print possible of the film and offered it without extras to get in the way. Instead you find yourself with a fun movie that will entertain while seeming silly in other ways. But if you put that aside and take the movie in on its own terms you're bound to have a good time.",1471132800,,3899,4.4130737134909594

The movie itself I didn't really love. It isn't that there is anything I can really point a finger at, it just didn't thrill me. I felt the actions of some of the characters, namely the authoress and her assistant weren't entirely believable. It's a simple whodunit? mystery. The Bat as a villain isn't much more of a villain than if he had no costume at all. The costume mainly provided a way to put him in the movie while hiding his face. The movie left me a bit confused and there really wasn't much chance to solve the crime as most of the clues were found by people searching the mansion rather than using logic from what they have seen.

In any event, 2 stars for the movie, 1 star for Vincent Price and another star for the quality of the DVD.

1082842,3,6305842000,"This is a great film for horror fans and especially those who love Vincent Price or Agnes Moorehead.  Both are in great form and the film, though dated, is fun to watch.  It is a typical ""haunted house"" plot, complete with a dead body in the closet, a group of terrified women, and a mad serial killer, called ""the Bat"", on the loose.  You'll stick with it and enjoy yourself, despite the obvious holes in the plot.

As to those holes, what woman (or man) in her/his right mind would stay in the mansion for 5 minutes, let alone all night, after finding a murdered corpse in the closet and then being told there is every chance the killer is still holed up somewhere in the huge mansion?  As the bodies pile up, it is even more incredible to see a single detective guarding the place, at one point leaving an assistant in his place, who is easily drugged while drinking wine (and he's supposed to be protecting the frightened women!).

Nonetheless, the film also operates as a who-done-it and viewers are in for some surprises as they try to identify the killer.

Not Vincent or Agnes's best, by any means, but still great work by both of them, particularly Moorehead as a nervy mystery writer who isn't easily scared off.",1458000000,3,1222,4.502262443438914

Better than one would expect from a public domain film.

The film itself is a goofy murder mystery which was a throwback even when it was filmed, but that only makes it more fun, especially elevated by the always wonderful Vincent Price. It's perfect viewing for a dark and stormy night, especially in October.",1456272000,,647,4.828828828828829

1082885,4,6305842000,"The Bat (1959) is billed as horror-thriller-mystery, but the way those genres have evolved over time its now mostly a straight-up mystery, noir style.

Vincent Price stars as a doctor doing bat research and Agnes Moorehead (Bewitched) as a mystery writer looking for new material. She finds plenty at an old country estate shes renteda quintessential dark-and-stormy-night Victorian mansion that comes with servants . . . at least until theyve abandoned her because they're convinced a murderer called The Bat might be returning to the scene of his crimes. A local detective (Gavin Gordon) plods around and a complicating factor is that bank securities were recently stolen and may be stashed somewhere inside that same creepy old house. A lot happens, but the spotlight is on Price and Moorehead, two iconic actors.

The Bat won't be for everyone, but if your children aren't averse to old black-and-white movies, this one is family-friendly. The violence is mostly bloodless or mostly off-screen, and the focus is on the mystery.

My son is a teen who appreciates good plotting, and he and I both marveled how a relatively simple concept could be complicated by believable twists and enhanced by cinematography that showcases all the shadows and angles weve come to associate with film noir. There are only a few melodramatic moments, with otherwise straight dramatic actingdecent acting, too. Director Crane Wilbur had written the script for the Price horror classic House of Wax, so its not surprising that with Price in the starring role hed slip in a few Gothic elements here too.

Old films like this are often campy, but while The Bat has its unintentionally funny or tongue-in-cheek moments, it really is a mystery that unapologetically goes about its business of planting clues and red herrings. There are a few slasher moments, and The Bats hat and distorted face and claws will suggest to horror-slasher fans that this film may have had a direct influence on the Freddy Krueger character design from the popular A Nightmare on Elm Street series. Thats kind of cool for film buffs, who might also find it fun that Darla from the original Our Gang/Little Rascals short films turns up as one of the adult female characters. And its certainly enjoyable seeing Moorehead in a serious role before she turned into one of TVs most famous witches.

The Bat is now in the public domain, and while The Film Detectives restored version looks good, for the most part, there are vertical white lines in spots and other flaws that are obviously a part of whatever print was used for the master. I haven't seen the DVD version so I cant offer a comparison, but I have no complaints other than what I just mentioned.

I asked my son what grade hed give this, and he said a B+ or A-, since he really liked it. Thats almost ironic, because Price went on record as saying he thought the script wasn't very good. I lean toward a B for this B-movie because mystery fans will recognize a formula and certain other conventions. Thats part of the genre, but the bottom line is always how well were those conventions and plot points integrated and developed? With The Bat, Id have to say it does a fairly decent job on both counts, and still holds up today. If you grab a copy for a family home movie night, you might as well go all out and for the warm-up also show a Thriller video featuring iconic horror actor Pricemaybe even dance a bit. Those are the kind of things your kids will remember years from now!",1450828800,,3497,4.752883031301483

1082916,5,6305842000,"On August 9, 1959, Crane Wilbur's film, ""The Bat"" (aprs the novel by Mary Roberts Reinhart), was premired, starring Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead.

Wilbur's career in the cinema, as actor, director, and writer, dated from the glorious Silent Era, and latterly included serving as screenwriter for the beautiful ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Ftima"" (1952).

This film regards a serial murderer who masks as the title rle, and is, in truth, more a ""Mystery Drama"" (as the play based on the novel was originally called) than a horror picture.  Price is very elegant and menacing as Dr Wells, and Moorehead has one of her finest outings as the ""maiden lady"" novelist, Miss Cornelia Van Gorder.  Very much the grande dame, she is wry, passionate, and marvelously theatrical.  The present writer would place only her performance in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (directed by Orson Welles, 1942) above this rather modest film in her oeuvre.

The film is charming in its ambiance of the nineteen-fifties and in the distinguished performances of the two stars.  As The New York Times rightly proclaimed when it was new, ""The Bat"" is a ""winner.""",1446249600,,1135,4.973544973544974

1082921,4,6305842000,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old B-horror movie!!

This movie is worth watching if you love a good mystery with a few thrills involved. There's a bit of humor thrown into the mix for those that like a little comedy in their mysteries - just enough to spice things up a bit.

This film is almost giallo-like in the way it plays out. We've got our hat wearing, gloved killer stalking the various characters, and a list of suspects including Vincent, a dodgy butler, a cop and the nephew of the guy who got killed at the start. Throw in a house full of secret rooms and you've got a winner with a surprisingly sharp script, too. As it's a murder mystery type film, I can't say too much about the plot, but The Bat does get his hands on a few victims and not everyone is who they seem.

I've gotta love these ladies! They are quite funny, tough and pretty smart.  They are out to help crack the mystery of ""the bat""!  The Bat has a woman writer who is like Agatha Christie, (Miss Cornelia wrote murder mysteries and does not scare easy...she does her own investigating in this story) She stays at a house that has a mysterious reputation.  Who is ""the bat""? You'll have to watch this interesting mystery-thriller to find the answer.

Of course, you can't go wrong with the acting talent here either  Agnes Moorehead (Endora from Bewitched) is about as tough as she can be as Cornelia van Gorder - I can tell you she's not ""the bat"" but she's out to get him. Moorehead's role as Gorder is almost as scary as ""the bat"" because she can be as mean as a bat in at times in this flick. Great performance from Agnes - which is one of the reasons this film is worth watching! She and her comic relief sidekick (Lenita Lane) find themselves targeted by the murderous Bat.

The cast is solid. In addition to Moorehead and Lane, Vincent Price is in this and he is Price is terrific as always.  What can I say? He's got a quiet wickedness in this film. Gavin Gordon is good but every time I see him in a role I am reminded of his Lord Byron from the Bride of Frankenstein prologue and I snicker a little. Also in the cast in a minor role (and her last) is Darla from The Little Rascals.

The cinematography is very nice. The film creates a genuine sense of mystery, and the masterful usage of shadows further improve on this. The atmosphere of tension it creates puts to shame most modern horror films.

A solid psychological thriller from top to bottom based on the terrific source material of the stage play filmed three times before (1915, 1927 and 1930). Shot with a confusing mix of dissolves, fades and wipes with no logical pattern you just don't know which way this movie is going to go stylistically. In that way it mirrors the plot which is filled with tantalizing red herrings.

""The Bat"" is marvelously entertaining, without resorting to excessive blood and gore.  I recommend anybody who enjoys these types of old films give it a shot  - makes a great late night flick!

If this sounds interesting to you, you can check out (a fairly poor quality) copy of the movie before you buy it.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
Murder-mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder [Agnes Moorehead] has leased a large country house called ""The Oaks"". After being in the house for only a few days, Cornelia's longtime maid, Lizzie Allen [Lenita Lane], informs her that the servants are upset over rumors they have heard about the murders committed in the house last winter by the archcriminal who goes by the name of The Bat. The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws.  They fear he is back.  Early in the film, The Bat enters Van Gorder's house and releases a bat.

That's hysterical nonsense, Cornelia says as she heads into Zenith to conduct some business at the Zenith City bank. She has another surprise when vice-president and head cashier of the bank, Victor Bailey [Mike Steele], mentions that the bank president and owner of The Oaks, John Fleming [Harvey Stephens], once said that he would never rent the house. Again, Cornelia is not concerned since she rented the house from his nephew, Mark Fleming [John Bryant].

As Cornelia chats with Victor's wife Dale [Elaine Edwards] and Lieutenant ""Andy"" Anderson [Gavin Gordon],a detective with the Zenith City Police Department and a member of the board of directors of the Zenith Bank, Victor is informed that the bank has been looted of over $1,000,000 in bonds and negotiable securities. Since the only two people with access to the vault are Victor himself and bank president John Fleming, who is currently away on a hunting trip in the Northwoods, Victor is arrested and attempts are made to contact Fleming.

Meanwhile, at his lodge in the Northwoods, John Fleming informs his hunting partner and physician, Doctor Malcolm Wells [Vincent Price], that he has just embezzled over $1,000,000 from the bank and he needs help in covering it up. His plan is to murder their hunting guide and disfigure the body enough that Wells can pass it off as Fleming. After ""Fleming"" is declared dead and buried, the two of them will split the million. The money is currently hidden in the Fleming family crypt in Zenith, he explains. Wells recalls a time, however, when Fleming was very sick and, in fever, talked about hiding the money in a hidden room in The Oaks. When Fleming announces that, if Wells doesn't go for the deal, he'll kill Wells and call it a ""hunting accident,"" Wells turns his shotgun on Fleming.

I ain't afraid of ghosts, Lizzie tells Cornelia when they read in the paper of John Fleming's death. Although the rest of the staff, except for Warner [John Sutton], the chauffeur, have quit their jobs, Lizzie intends to stay with ""Miss Corny"" under any circumstances. Because there's a storm brewing, Lizzie and Cornelia check to be sure all the doors and windows are shut. Lizzie suddenly sees a black-clawed hand reach through the front door, just about to grab Cornelia's throat. Lizzie's screams scare him off; Cornelia calls the police. They send someone over to check the grounds, but no one is found.

Cornelia and Lizzie go upstairs and lock themselves in a bedroom. Meanwhile, The Bat has cut a hole in the front-door window, unlocked the door, and entered the house. As Cornelia and Lizzie try to sleep, he opens the transom into their room and releases a bat that flits around for a moment, lands on Lizzie's arm, and bites her. With Lizzy in a panic, fearing she may now have contracted ""the rabies"", an outbreak of which local papers have reported, Van Gorder calls her doctor, Dr Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price), who is conducting research on bats.

He dresses her arm and gives her a sleeping pill. After examining the bat, he proclaims that it doesn't look sick but that he won't know for sure until he examines its brain under a microscope. Meanwhile, Lt Andy has taken advantage of Dr Wells' absence and let himself into the lab where he snoops around and notices the experimental bat and a figure of a large bat in one of the windows. Andy then drives over to The Oaks, arriving just as Wells is leaving. Andy points out the hole in the glass where The Bat gained entrance and assures Cornelia that an officer will keep watch on the house for the rest of the night.

Meanwhile, the whole town is searching for a million-dollar stash of looted bank securities that were recently stolen.  Several days/weeks? have gone by, and Victor Bailey's trial is coming up. His secretary, Judy Hollister [Darla Hood], apparently has some information that will help to acquit him, so people are beginning to suspect that John Fleming robbed his own bank. Lt Anderson, concerned that his holdings at the bank will be wiped out if the money isn't found, pays a visit to Mark Fleming. Mark reveals that he hasn't received a dime of his inheritance from his uncle because the money is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Cornelia has managed to retain John Fleming's old maid, Jane Patterson [Riza Royce]. When Dr Wells, Dale Bailey, and Judy Hollister drop by for tea, they all discuss the possibility that it was John Fleming who actually robbed the bank. Cornelia suggests that Fleming may have hidden the money in The Oaks, and Dale phones Mark to see whether there are any floorplans of the house. Mark isn't sure why she would want the floorplan, so Lt Andy suggests that maybe Uncle John DID steal the money and hid it in the house. Mark agrees to come over that evening and help look for the plans.

Come over Mark does, but he lets himself into the house with his own key while Cornelia, Dale, and Judy are eating dinner. He moves aside a grandfather clock and opens a panel to a secret closet. While he looks over the floorplans, The Bat enters the house and sneaks up behind, clobbers Mark, and makes off with the floorplans. After dinner, Cornelia is amazed to hear the grandfather clock striking the hour, when it hasn't done so in years. They notice that the clock has been moved, then Dale sees the panel behind it. They open the panel to find Mark Fleming...dead. Lt Anderson and Dr Wells are notified after the police are called. After seeing the claw marks on Mark's throat, Anderson proclaims it the work of The Bat.

Later that night, after the police have combed the house for clues and Mark's body has been taken to the morgue, Lt Anderson remains to make sure all the windows and doors are locked. As he checks the rooms, he doesn't notice that Warner is watching him. After the ladies have gone to sleep, Cornelia and Lizzie in one room, Judy and Dale in another, The Bat comes in through the unlocked front door. First, he cuts the phone line. He then goes up to the third floor and into a storage room where he starts tapping on the walls. The noise wakes up Judy and Dale. Thinking she may be able to find the hidden money and clear her husband, Dale sneaks up to the third floor. The Bat locks her in the room and runs downstairs. On the way down, he runs into Judy and kills her, then he flees out the front door, after first being struck in the neck by a poker thrown by Cornelia.

Shortly thereafter, Lt Andy comes in the front door. He explains that he was chasing someone on the grounds and asks as to the whereabouts of Warner the chauffeur. Warner suddenly comes in the front door and explains that he was following Anderson when he was suddenly hit on the head. It's then that Anderson remembers seeing a wanted poster with Warner's picture on it, but Warner says that he was tried and acquitted. He vehemently denies being The Bat. Suddenly, Dr Wells walks in the front door. He had an accident about a mile down the road, he says, and walked back to the house to use the phone. Andy notices blood on Wells' neck. Hmmm, could Dr Wells be The Bat?

Several nights later, after the house had been searched from top to bottom without finding any money or a hidden room, Cornelia decides to conduct an investigation of her own. When the detective on duty falls asleep in his chair, Cornelia goes up to the third floor to look around in the storage room where The Bat was tapping on the walls. Measuring the distance between the storage room and the room next to it, Cornelia notices a loss of about five feet between the two rooms. She pounds on the walls, then on the panels of a fireplace. Suddenly, one of the panels opens up, revealing a switch that allows the fireplace to swing open. Cornelia has found the hidden room. It is empty, except for a safe in the wall. As she kneels before the safe, the fireplace swings closed, trapping her in the room.

Meanwhile, The Bat has gone to Dr Wells' lab where he hangs a note on the wall. It says: ""Here lies The Bat -- threatened with exposure he destroyed himself."" As The Bat turns around, Wells walks into the room with his gun drawn. The doctor taunts The Bat with the fact that he knows where the money is hidden and that he's going to shoot The Bat and put his own sign on his own chest. Just as Wells cocks the gun, The Bat leaps at him. They struggle, the gun goes off, and it is Wells who is shot.

Cornelia's pounding on the walls wakes Lizzie, who notices that Cornelia's bed is empty. She goes down to the parlor and tries to wake up Detective Davenport [Robert Williams], only to find him drugged into sleep. Lizzie wakes the maid who goes to get Warner, only to find him missing. The detective calls headquarters to alert Lt Anderson only to find that he's been sent to investigate the death of Dr Wells. The three of them -- Lizzie, Jane, and Davenport -- look outside for Cornelia, but she doesn't answer their calls. Suddenly, Lizzie notices a light on the third floor and redirects everyone up there. The air in the hidden room is rapidly depleting. Cornelia can barely manage call out. She tells them to hit the panels over the fireplace and then passes out. Lizzie gives each panel a pound, finds the switch, and opens the fireplace just in the nick of time.

Outside the house, The Bat is slinking around in the bushes. He has started the garage on fire, but Cornelia is wise to him. That fire was set to get us out of the house, she tells everyone. Instead of leaving, they turn out the lights and wait. A few minutes later, The Bat appears. When The Bat enters the hidden room, Davenport fires a shot. But The Bat is quicker and shoots Davenport. He then turns to the ladies who are hiding behind some boxes. Just as he's about to open fire on the ladies, he is shot from behind. Warner enters the room, his gun smoking. They remove the hood from over the Bat's face to find ... Lt Anderson.",1443744000,,14057,4.512185534591195

If you want to know what the movie is about, I suggest Internet Movie Data Base for the plot synopsis. This review is for the FILM CHEST remastered issue of ""The Bat"", starring Vincent Price, and the quality of this reissue.

Watched it on a $400 Dell DLP projector, 110"" screen, with upscaling $60.00 Sony Blu-Ray player, and a modest Bose 3-2-1 audio system I got off Craigslist for $300.00.

Oh wow. Wow! SPECTACULAR! My theater room packed with guests was captivated and enthralled at the experience.

Crisp, crystal clear, pristine film tonality in glorious black & white, 16 x 9 aspect ratio, sound track was attended to equality to the film. I can't say enough about how virgin this DVD experience was. I hope you understand what I mean by that. Let me put it this way; We thought we were in the theater on opening night back in 1959. And you will, too.

Naturally, FILM CHEST can't spend million$ on film restorations and keep a profitably price point for a business model or end use consumer. BUT, they pride themselves on their restoration professionalism and quality (And hit it out of the park). To the point they boastfully have a video demo of their restoration process on the FILM CHEST MEDIA GROUP web site that touts their pain staking efforts, advanced technology, and articulate attention to detail in the restoration process. FILM CHEST has it down.

If you're a fan of Classic Movies, and tired of getting ripped off by poor pump & dump dub houses, look no further than FILM CHEST. And get this FILM CHEST issue of ""The Bat"" on DVD. Do not be turned off that this release is DVD. It more than holds-it-own against the finest blu-ray movies in your collection.",1388361600,3,1766,4.6293929712460065

It's a black and white movie and the print looks pretty good , with no scratches and such on it.  I saw this in hd on tcm and it looked outstanding.  It's a murder mystery first and a horror movie second and it's of it's era , but that's ok! You could catch countless plays on radio like this one , and this was around before radio even.

That being said, the film is one of those favorites of mine which provide me with pleasure despite minimal production values and routine direction. It is a very old-fashioned mystery story, who will the murdering Bat kill next and will another murderer find the million stolen dollars for which he is looking.  It all takes place in an old mansion made to be spooky and with a group of women in that mansion sure to be frightened, save spooked or not, redoubtable mystery book writer Moorehead who has her trusty pistol at the ready to handle anything that comes along.
While I can enjoy it for the star players, the old fashioned production and the stereotyped plot and cast reactions to danger, I have no idea whether a younger audience can tolerate the same features.

1083030,3,6305842000,"She might not have been a critic's darling, but the reading public loved author Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957.) Her 1907 novel THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE was among her most popular works, and in 1917 Rinehart joined forces with playwright Avery Hopwood to adapt it to the stage. After three years of work and much revision, THE BAT's combination of eccentric characters, spooky effects, slapstick humor and mystery took the New York stage by storm. And in 1926 it became one of the most popular films of the late silent era with stars Jack Pickford, Emily Fitzroy, and Louise Fazenda.  The movie was so popular that when sound came in it got a remake titled THE BAT WHISPERS, this time with early widescreen and a cast that included Una Merkle, Chester Morris, and Maude Eburne.

In its early versions, the play and film helped establishe a host of conventions that have been popular ever since, most particularly the idea of an old, dark house beset by a phantom-like creature and a mixture of comedy and thrills.  But in 1959 these notions had become cliche, and this verison of THE BAT is distinctly ""B.""  Mystery writer Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) and her maid Lizzie (Lenita Lane) has rented a mansion in the country for the summer--but it soon transpires that their choice of residence has been unfortunate: the owner has died, his bank has been robbed, the money is concealed in the house... and a master criminal known as The Bat wants it!  Before you can say ""It's the BAT!"" there are secret passages, suspicious characters, screaming maids, and shots in the dark.  But in truth, and in spite of solid performances by Moorehead and co-star Vincent Price, THE BAT is pretty mild stuff, and it reminded me a great deal of a William Castle production.

All this said, THE BAT is fun if you don't expect too much.  Watch for Darla Hood, a member of the ""Our Gang"" troup grown into adulthood, in her final screen role--and there is a surprise twist that will amuse.  It's good fun for fans of the period and the genre, but most others will probably be unimpressed.

1083031,3,6305842000,"This movie is ok. I watched it finally on one of my fifty pack movie collections. The movie has a solid plot and the movie takes a few turns. I knew all along that at the end of the movie The Bat, the killer, would be the police detective. I was surprised that the Vincent Price character, the doctor, was killed in the film. I liked the black gloves that the killer wore which resembled menacing claws. At the end of the movie I wasn't sure if Agnes Moorhead, the writer, was using the incidents that just happened for a book or if perhaps the whole thing had been a book played out on screen the entire time. I don't recall Agnes Moorehead ever sitting down and going into thought or anything. So it seems likely that the murders and the mystery of The Bat really happened. So does this mean that Agnes Moorehead, the movie's mystery writer was stealing from real life at the end of the movie? The movie didn't seem to be as clever as it wanted to be but it wasn't a bad movie at all. If you have nothing better to do than to sit in front of the tube to kill some time then pop this movie in if you happen to have it in a fifty movie, more or less, pack.",1340755200,,1156,4.074561403508772

She plays it like she's playing Shakespeare and that's one of the reasons why this picture works so well.

The riffs come lightning fast from this pair who have already seemed to generate great chemistry.  The pace of their delivery is pretty spot on, they do occasionally talk over each other and the audio does need to be turned up a bit to hear everything.  That may ruin some people's opinion of it, but it never took away from the jokes if I had to rewind a bit to catch it all.  I believe this was made in 2010 so the jokes are fairly current and topical, more of the tradition of Rifftrax than say early MST3K.  I would have to rate the content at a high PG or low PG-13.  No vulgar language but a few references to female anatomy and suggestive comments of sexual orientation, I can't imagine anyone being offended by the good natured ribbing.

Price is Dr. Wells in this inferior re-make of Roland West's 1926 classic. Most of the atmosphere of West's film is gone, especially missed are the William Cameron Menzies set designs and the rodant-masked thief/killer. However, this version boasts wonderful performances by Vincent Price and Agnes Moorhead with lots of barbed wit and banter. What's weird here is that the actor who played Dr. Wells in the silent 1926 version looks JUST LIKE Vincent Price!!!!!! I saw this 1959 version first on tv in the early 1960's after it was featured in a popular Monster Magazine of the time (no, not FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND) and was completely taken by this adaptation of Mary Roberts Rinehart's novel/play. So, I have the same soft spot in my heart for this Price epic as I do for HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Both would make a great Halloween double bill, as I've presented them on occassion in the past and will probably do so again this October.
Yeah, you can search around for who has the best public domain version of THE BAT, but I'll tell you here and now that the APLHA dvd for the money is probably your best buy, and even better than that, the ALPHA dvd of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is exceptional, clear, pristine, sharp, a remarkable buy at a budget price!!!

1083054,3,6305842000,"The story is set in a dark and creepy old mansion called the Oaks, where an author (Agnes Moorehead) is writing her next mystery novel.  It seems a crazed killer, nicknamed ""The Bat,"" is terrorizing the area, murdering women by slashing their throats with bat-like claws.  Also, the local bank has been robbed of a million dollars that is somehow connected to the Oaks.  The local doctor (Vincent Price) befriends the writer, but is he as kindly as he seems?

Vincent Price made a lot of cheap but good movies in the fifties; unfortunately, this isn't one of them.  The ridiculous script is full of holes, the dialogue is amateurish, and though Price's scenes are the best, he has only a small part.  Most of the actors, especially the usually-wonderful Moorehead, speak so haltingly they sound like they're making up their lines as they go along.  No one has any common sense, including the laughable police force, and all the running up and down the dark staircase and constant opening and closing of doors is just so corny.

This is the kind of movie where they use a one-watt flash bulb to dramatically look for clues in the dark; it isn't strong enough to shine light on anything, but that's okay since the room is lit like daylight anyway.  It is fun to see Darla Hood of ""Our Gang"" fame all grown up in a minor role, though.

While there isn't a single scare in the film, it's ok; just don't expect this to be one of Vincent Price's best.",1305590400,,1445,4.523076923076923
1083055,5,6305842000,"""The Bat"" is the kind of ""old dark house"" mystery they just don't make anymore--spooky, with great atmosphere, clutching hands, hidden passages, and a mysterious, masked killer. This character, I'm convinced, with his fedora and clawed gloves, may have inspired director Wes Craven's creation of Freddy Krueger in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""

""The Bat"" is marvelously entertaining, without resorting to excessive blood and gore. The film has a rich assortment of great character actors--Vincent Price, Agnes Moorehead, Gavin Gordon, John Sutton, and, yes, even a post-""Little Rascals"" Darla Hood. Price, as Dr. Wells, one of the film's few red herrings, and Moorehead, as mystery novelist Cornelia Van Gorder, seem to be having a ball, chewing the scenery when it needs to be chewed.

Speaking of Cornelia, I'm wondering if the film is implying that she and her long-time maid, Lizzie Allen, are lesbians? Besides living together for twenty years, there's never a hint of either one having been married or having had any close, romantic relationships with men. Also, at one point, when Lizzie remarks that what they're going through in this murder-ridden mansion is worse than having had a baby, Cornelia shoots back with, ""Oh, Lizzie, you never HAD a baby!"" Was she perhaps reminding her of their sexual orientation? Most tellingly, perhaps, in one scene, they hug each other a little TOO tightly, I think, in collective fear. Granted, their not sleeping together in the same bed (Cornelia offers Lizzie the couch instead) might argue against this interpretation. Still, I DO find it an interesting possibility.

But forget about possible hidden subtexts, and just enjoy the film. Despite an obviously modest budget (except for one assistant, we never see Chief of Detective Andy Anderson's full staff) and the lack of quite enough credible red herrings, I highly recommend ""The Bat"" for old-fashioned, chilling entertainment.",1305417600,,1928,5.273615635179153
1083056,3,6305842000,"Vincent Price was always able to make a run-of-the-mill horror movie seem like so much more. And that's the case with ""The Bat,"" an otherwise okay-but-not-great mystery based on Mary Roberts Rinehart's mystery. It's creepy and a little campy, but not much as a mystery.

Author Cornelia van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) has rented a rural mansion for her writing, even though her maid Lizzie (Lenita Lane) claims that the serial-killing Bat has been prowling around. Of course, the Bat breaks into the house, scares them silly, and vanishes by the time the police arrive.

The problem is, Cornelia doesn't have anything the Bat would want -- but is his presence connected to a recent bank embezzlement, and the mystery death of the banker who owned the mansion? It seems so, and now the race is on between Cornelia, Lizzie and her friends, and a ruthless masked killer.

Basically it's a straightforward treasure hunt, but with murder thrown in the mix, as well as the question of who the Bat is -- in true mystery tradition, you can guess by figuring out the least likely suspect. In the meantime, there are hidden rooms, forest fires, campy shrieks, rubber bats, and those awkward-looking gloves with fake claws attached.

The big problem with ""Bat"" is that it doesn't have any clues (neither did the book, admittedly). There are a few red herrings -- such as Price messing around with bats in his lab -- but what is a mystery if the audience doesn't have any chance at all of solving it? (That, and the torn throats are suspiciously bloodless)

Price plays a relatively small part -- that of a jovial, sinister doctor who may or may not be the Bat -- but he steals all his scenes, especially since he also seems to be the most intelligent person in the cast. But Moorehead is also quite good, playing Cornelia as an independent, acid-tongued spinster who doesn't let anyone underestimate her.

There are quite a few versions of this movie out there, most of them terrible. The best one I've seen is Platinum Disc, which comes with a funny menu, as well as clear picture, clear sound, and no fizzing, fuzzing or jumps. They found a very good print for this movie.

Vincent Price plays a murderous Doctor who enjoys taking vacations with recovered psychotic patients who still have violent tendencies. I'm still not clear if his best partner in crime is the dude who dons the mask or not...but it's another mysterious element of this movie which keeps your interest.

Looking for Elaine Edwards (the blonde actress from Cameron Mitchell's ""Inside The Mafia"", same year) and Darla Hood (the cast list has their names - gotta Google-it again I guess).

So in the mix are a not completely recovered psychotic; an evil Doctor (his evilness covers his own medical descriptions); the actual ""Bat"" dude; the writer; her maid/housekeeper; her ex-chauffeur, now Butler trainee who occasionally likes to drive himself to the airport and back; another maid/housekeeper; the presumptive Assistant Bank Manager; his fiance; a young lady expected to testify as a Bat witness (?); a Protective Officer; let's see, oh yeah, real bats....and, uh.

But all these features contribute to the crazy, albeit often harrowing effects.

1083075,4,6305842000,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I got it because I love ""The House on Haunted Hill"".  Vincent Price is one of my all time favorites!",1195084800,,130,4.16
1083076,3,6305842000,"This movie seems to come in an incredible variety of versions.  This version seems to be the only one in widescreen.  I generally prefer the widescreen versions because you get to see the movie as the director intended it.

As the movie opens we meet bank president John Fleming (Harvey Stephens, who also appeared in ""Sergeant York,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and nearly 100 more movies and television shows) and Dr. Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price, who has 180 appearances to his credit in a variety of media; two of his more recent appearances were in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"").  We learn that Fleming has embezzled a million dollars from his bank and hidden it somewhere around the Oaks.

We next meet Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorhead, whose first role was in ""Citizen Kane"" and who had more than 100 movie and television roles to her credit), who has rented ""The Oaks,"" a mansion where a man called the Bat murdered several people many years earlier.  Ms. Van Gorder has assistant Lizzie Allen (Lenita Lane in her final role) with her.

This movie is filled with a number of other characters who seem to be in the movie primarily to keep us guessing who the actual murderer is.  Other than the real murderer, the one character that stood out is Judy Hollander, played by former Our Gang member Darla Hood in her final film appearance and her next to last film performance.

This movie was filmed in a classic whodunit style.  There are numerous mis-directions and overly dramatic moments.  There are also moments of over-acting to match.  The house is classic, with numerous rooms, large open spaces, secret panels and a hidden room.  Though I had a reasonably good idea who the murderer was and though some of the acting was weak, this movie was worth a watch.  Actually, I have watched this one twice now and enjoyed it more the second time I watched it.

Fans of radio mysteries, whodunits, ""old dark house"" mysteries, Vincent Price and Agnes Moorhead will find this movie worth at least one watch, maybe more.  Just be sure you get the wide screen version!

1083077,3,6305842000,"Vincent Price was always able to make a run-of-the-mill horror movie seem like so much more. And that's the case with ""The Bat,"" an otherwise okay-but-not-great mystery based on Mary Roberts Rinehart's mystery. It's creepy and a little campy, but not much as a mystery.

Author Cornelia van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) has rented a rural mansion for her writing, even though her maid Lizzie (Lenita Lane) claims that the serial-killing Bat has been prowling around. Of course, the Bat breaks into the house, scares them silly, and vanishes by the time the police arrive.

The problem is, Cornelia doesn't have anything the Bat would want -- but is his presence connected to a recent bank embezzlement, and the mystery death of the banker who owned the mansion? It seems so, and now the race is on between Cornelia, Lizzie and her friends, and a ruthless masked killer.

Basically it's a straightforward treasure hunt, but with murder thrown in the mix, as well as the question of who the Bat is -- in true mystery tradition, you can guess by figuring out the least likely suspect. In the meantime, there are hidden rooms, forest fires, campy shrieks, rubber bats, and those awkward-looking gloves with fake claws attached.

The big problem with ""Bat"" is that it doesn't have any clues (neither did the book, admittedly). There are a few red herrings -- such as Price messing around with bats in his lab -- but what is a mystery if the audience doesn't have any chance at all of solving it? (That, and the torn throats are suspiciously bloodless)

Price plays a relatively small part -- that of a jovial, sinister doctor who may or may not be the Bat -- but he steals all his scenes, especially since he also seems to be the most intelligent person in the cast. But Moorehead is also quite good, playing Cornelia as an independent, acid-tongued spinster who doesn't let anyone underestimate her.

""The Bat"" is only middling as a mystery, but is pretty fun in a haunted-house kind of way. And it's worth getting, if nothing else, to see Price carrying a bat in a medical bag.",1166918400,,2070,4.704419889502763
1083078,4,6305842000,"Was it the Maid, the Doctor, the Butler or the Bat?. The only reason I picked up a copy of this movie was because Vincent Price was in it. The bat also stars Agnes Moorehead, who I've never liked in anything she's done. Much to my surprise Agnes Moorehead gave a great performance of her character Cornelia Van Gorder. Vincent Price was equally good in the part of Doctor Wells even if it was more of a supporting role. This movie is not a horror movie but more of a thriller/mystery. The black & white video transfer of this Anchor Bay release is fantastic to say the least. The picture is really sharp and the dolby 2.0 sound isn't bad, but could have been tweaked a little. Turn out the lights, fill up the snack dish and plop this one in the DVD player on a dark dreary night.

There are quite a few versions of this movie out there, most of them terrible. The best one I've seen is Platinum Disc, which comes with a funny menu, as well as clear picture, clear sound, and no fizzing, fuzzing or jumps. They found a very good print for this movie.

""The Bat"" is only middling as a mystery, but is pretty fun in a haunted-house kind of way. And it's worth getting, if nothing else, to see Price carrying a bat in a medical bag.",1165363200,10,2340,4.651331719128329
1083080,3,6305842000,"I am disappointed to have to inform the general, unprepared public that the film THE BAT does not feature a giant evil bat, or a genetically enhanced killer bat, or even Adam West doing the Batusi.  No, the movie is only titled thusly because the (human) villain has given himself the name ""The Bat"".  Unfortunately, this is one of the only interesting things about the bad guy in this film.

As cheesy, cheap horror movies go, THE BAT isn't half bad.  It's unpredictable in the sense that the movie keeps the identity of the killer a secret by throwing so much information at the viewer that each character has half a dozen clues pointing to him.  The number of red herrings may make the Sherlock Holmesian portion of the audience weep, but it makes for an entertaining -- if totally incoherent -- ride.

The movie stars Agnes Moorehead (of CITIZEN KANE and ""Bewitched"" fame) as Cornelia van Gorder, a writer of cheap thrillers.  (Her books are described as corny, and her friend shortens Cornelia to ""Corny"".  Did you catch the joke there?  Did you?)  She's one of those fictional authors who somehow makes a huge amount of money from her scribblings, so she's taking the entire summer off and renting a luxurious mansion in a picturesque locale out in the country.

Ah, but where would a cheap horror movie be without Vincent Price?  He shows up in his first scene wearing a stupid flannel shirt and wielding a shotgun.  He purrs his way through the rest of the movie as Dr. Wells, one of the characters who keeps getting drawn back to the mansion.

The mansion is where the bulk of the story takes place.  You see, there's a hell of a lot of plot, and all of it comes back to the mansion.  A million dollars has been embezzled from the local bank. There's already been one murder because of this.  The money is hidden inside a secret room in the mansion, and while Moorehead and her maid/friend Lizzie are ignorant of these events, they have their own problems.  Newspaper reports are hyping the recent killing spree of a serial murderer called ""The Bat"", a mean fellow who specializes in killing women, and who has taken a healthy interest in the mansion.

Scenes featuring the Bat show the nefarious villain creeping through the shadows in a black suit, a black ski-mask and a Jack Abarmoff black fedora.  Is he attracted to the mansion because of the ill-gotten loot?  Or is he simply preying on the women for kicks?  Well, you'll have to wait during most of the movie while the screenwriter makes up his mind on that one.

The Bat is a relatively lackluster villain.  He has no great lines of dialog, no fun character quirks.  He does, however, have one redeeming feature.  One of his methods of murder is to release a rabid bat into a room where his victim sleeps.  Unfortunately, he only does this in one scene.  A scene with one of the worst special effect animals I've seen in a long time.  Indeed, I have vague memories of the Three Stooges being harassed by the same rubber bat prop to equally hilarious effect some years before.  (The difference, of course, is that the Three Stooges were deliberately trying to amuse.)

Agnes Moorehead and Vincent Price are really the only two memorable people in this movie.  I watched this movie a few weeks ago, and when playing it again this evening to refresh my memory for this review, I realized that I had completely forgotten about every character who wasn't played by Moorehead or Price.  The rest of the cast simply stand around blankly, passively waiting their turn to be killed off.  (Basically, if you aren't Moorehead or Price, then there are only two actions for you to perform.  You can either discover a new corpse, or you can be the new corpse.)

I mentioned that this is a decent film, but one gets the impression that this could have been much better.  The appeal comes mostly from the cheesy, camp factor, yet with little effort, this could have been much better.  Indeed, other films that were derived from the same source material have a much better reputation than this.

There's no real tension, no sense of danger.  A haunted spooky house is a common location for horror movies, but this mansion does nothing to distinguish itself.  There are no ominous shadows, no creaky staircases.  (There's the requisite dusty suit of armor, but it gets killed off in the first act.)  In fact the only way we have of knowing that this is indeed a spooky, eerie house is that the characters keep insisting that it is.

I'm reviewing the Digiview Productions release of this DVD and the picture and sound quality are more than adequate for this kind of movie.  There is an odd purple blotch that occasionally shimmies across the picture.  Annoying as this interference is, it's often times more lively than the actors currently appearing on screen.

While this version of THE BAT is entertaining, it's nothing to write home about.  I suspect that if I track down the other versions of this movie (1926's THE BAT and 1930's THE BAT WHISPERS) I'd probably enjoy them in the manner in which they were intended.  As it exists, THE BAT is a fun movie, if goofy at times.  Moorehead and Price at least make this watchable.",1141171200,,5179,4.625

1083082,4,6305842000,"Even way back in 1926, they were making re-makes of films. This story was told in two silent films in 1915 and 1926.  Then when putting sound into film was invented, they made another ""Bat"" film for 1930.  Thank goodness by 1939, film became more advanced to make GONE WITH THE WIND (1939), THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939) and The BLUE BIRD (1940).

  In 1959, they gave ""The Bat"" a full black & white treatment. They cast the master of macabre, Vincent Price and the stunning Agnes Moorehead (whom you remember in Who's Minding The Store [1963] and the ""Bewitched tv series [1964-72]).  Darla Hood plays ""Judy Hollander"".  You recall Darla Hood from the Our Gang/Little Rascals short films.

  Agnes Moorehead (as ""Cornelia Van Gorder"") is a novelist who lives at The Oaks.  The Oaks is a mansion.  She has heard the haunted house stories of the place, but she thinks they are ridiculous.  meanwhile it has just been discovered that the town bank has been looted of millions of dollars in securities.  One customer's bonds were being held there as colateral for a loan.  Those bonds are gone.  They want to reach John Fleming (Harvey Stephens), but he is in the woods with Dr. Wells (Vincent Price) and they can not be reached.  In the woods, Fleming tells Dr. wells that he embezzled the millions from his bank that he works at. They also discuss a possible hidden room in The Oaks mansion and faking Fleming's death so he can make his getaway.  So who do they murder for the body?  Suddenly, they open the door to see the woods are on fire.  At The Oaks, a storm is brewing, the lights are out. There's a man trying to get in the mansion.

  That is just for starters.  The suspense is compelling!
