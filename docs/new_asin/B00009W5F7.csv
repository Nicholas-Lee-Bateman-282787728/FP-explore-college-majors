1893391,5,B00009W5F7,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!
I have been a fan of Bear Bryant ever since I can remember.  He was without a doubt one of the toughest college coaches in the history of football.  The Junction Boys is about Coach Bryants tenure at Texas A&M.  Sure some critics say that this movie focused more on the brutal treatment of player rather than football, but thats is what set coach Bryant apart from other coachs.  His practices were brutal, maybe to the point of torture.  But maybe his long hard practices are part of what made him one of the winningest coaches in college football history!  If your going to cry about this not being a football film, go watch Remember The Titans instead.  But if you want a true insite on the icon that is Paul Bear Bryant, and what he was like as a man, this movie is a must have!  Roll Tide!",1057968000,3,814,4.2745098039215685

1893418,4,B00009W5F7,"I grew up a huge Bear Bryant fan and Berenger does a fine job of displaying the Coach's determination, grit, and later regret at having put the players through such a wringer. My only complaint is that some of the cursing used in the film was deemed inaccurate by the original Junction Boys. The opening scene was a joy for me, as it reflected Bama's win over Penn State in the 1978 Sugar Bowl- with the famous goal-line stand.",1453420800,,427,4.417721518987341

1893499,5,B00009W5F7,"I like the this story, but I am an old school coach myself.  It reminds me of the young boys that I coached and then watched go off to war.  Few of todays athletes would endure such abuse, and it was abusive, but listening to the interviews of the survivors that is included in the DVD, it is obvious that they have a special love for this coach, Bear Bryant.  The selflessness that these boys learned became a virture that carried them through life.  Even though that lesson was learned from brutal challenges, most of them did not seem bitter.  Imagine what it was like to graduate from high school and then get drafted to go fight in WWII, Korea, Vietnam, or any war for that matter.  Life can be tough, and to grow up as strong men, boys need a disciplined (but not abusive) upbringing.",1389657600,,790,4.376712328767123

1893517,5,B00009W5F7,Good movie - Interesting story about Bear Bryant it's truly a wonder these kids survived to play the game and learn to respect the coach.,1363824000,,137,4.52

1893548,5,B00009W5F7,"While it was not completely true, that is the way it is with movies.  However Tom Berenger did an excellent job and the movie gets to real meat of how football was coached in those days.  Some think it was extreme, but the cream always rises to the top.",1358121600,,253,4.142857142857143
1893549,5,B00009W5F7,The movie is great.  It gives more definition to who Bear Bryant was/is and the team he coached during this time.,1357084800,,113,4.380952380952381
1893550,5,B00009W5F7,Bear Bryant possessed and demanded a toughness that seems to be fading in current generations. Junction Boys did great job of displaying that.,1356912000,,142,5.217391304347826
1893551,3,B00009W5F7,"I understand that when putting an novel on film, a certain amount of 'compression' is needed in order to tell the core story in a limited amount of time.  Unfortunately, the characters (or the 'Boys' themselves in this case) were hacked and slashed in a manner that was far worse than anything that happened to them under the burning Texas sun.  And to no noble, character building end this time around. If the screenwriter was actually attempting to make these real life people totally unrecognizible by changing their names and creating characters that were compiled from the characteristics of several different people, then he succeeded. What comes across is a conglomeration of watered down protagonists who largely get lost in the shuffle of the story which becomes more about Paul Bryant and less about the Title Characters themselves. Yes, 'The Bear' grew and learned from this experiece as much if not more than the young men he coached, but the real story is still about 'The Junction Boys'.  Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten lost somewhere along the way.",1356825600,2,1072,4.977653631284916
1893552,5,B00009W5F7,"Coach Bear Bryant began his storied career at Texas A & M before moving to the University of Alabama.  In this video, Bryant pushes his athletes beyond the brink, far beyond the realm of sanity.  If coaches,now, began training camp like this, they would be fired before training camp ended; however, the Junction Boys gives us an idea of how far Bryant would push the envelope, and more importantly, how the boys would respond.  The ending shows the respect the players had for their coach decades later; it is apparent that both sides grew in understanding of the human spirit as time passes.
An excellent film...",1355875200,,614,4.773584905660377

1893556,5,B00009W5F7,"Berenger does a great job of portraying Bryant. I think this one shows both the tough and soft side of Bear before the 'Bama days, and it shows just how competitive he was and how tough he wanted his teams.",1353110400,,206,4.175
1893557,5,B00009W5F7,My dad is a Junction Boy so exciting to read about him before I was even thought about. Would like to go back in time and meet him back then. See if we agree on things.

The budget was only $3 million, so you couldn't ask for ""Hoosiers'' or ""Cinderella Man.'' But I liked it overall. I suggest that you read my book before you watch the movie.

It was an interesting inside look at the Bear and reasons why he would be a great coach and also why he would be very difficult to play for. His philosophy was to beat his players down and then build them from the ground up. For any football who hasn't seen this movie, it is a good one to check out.

Camp is grulling. Truly the Bear is the best. Six national titles and only one losing season. The only ring he wore was the Junction Boys ring. He truly had such great respect for these guys.

He felt like the camp in Junction was cruel and unusual punishment. From a historical point of view I remember things like this happening during that time in our history. I know coaches did things differently then; I am glad we have grown as humans since then. I also was pleased at how the movie ended. I have read the biography of Paul ""Bear"" Bryant and feel that the movie did a good job of depicting him as a man and coach of a time past.

Paul Bryant comes out looking like a bad guy here which I'm sure doesn't sit well with many college football fans. The extra features however are excellent. The ESPN presentations of Sports Century and The Real Junction Boys alone make this a worthy addition for any football fan. If you are interested in this story buy the book. It's much more informative and portrays Bryant in a much better and understandable light. Was he mean? Yes! Was he ornery? Always!

1893618,5,B00009W5F7,"I first watched this movie while working as a Behavioral Health worker with borderline criminial Adolecents age 12-17.  A fellow co-worker brought the film in as a suprise ""treat movie"" for the kids.

In all my years (there have been many) I have never seen a reaction to a film from this population in all my life.  The story of the team and Mr. Bryant and how it wa portrayed in this film made the kids begin to think of their own lives , and how they could do better for people.

It was a strange reaction to this film, but it truly moved them and myself.

As far as the film itself goes Berringer is great as is the support cast and the studio did an excellent job.  I have heard the book is even better.",1139875200,10,708,4.131386861313868
1893619,5,B00009W5F7,"There is nothing about this movie that sugar coats what happened at junction in 1954. Even coach bryant knew that he went too far and was too rigid with his rules and standards. So rigid that even players who were sick and injured from the ordeal were not allowed to stay on the team if they couldn't practice. After A&M lost their first game in a blow out bryant said ""that one was on me"" because the players were too beat up. That 1-9 season was bryant's only losing season ever! Understand the historical significance? The greatest college coach ever had a 1-9 team because of junction!

We need to have a historical perspective here. First of all texas a&m was not a small school. It is a big time major football school with a long history of winning. Back in the 1950s and even into the 60s it was not uncommon for coaches to work their players half to death in searing heat with no water. They believed then that it toughened them up. Read about bud wilkinson at oklahoma and you see the same thing. Also at that time you had a lot of walk ons. Students who played high school football but didn't get a scholarship trying out for the team. These walk ons were treated very cruel as a means of thinning them out quickly. That happened here but it happened everywhere.

This is a movie about survival under incredibly tough circumstances. The fact that those circumstances were forced upon them doesn't change that. Bryant loved those 35 men because he knew he pushed them too hard; because he knew he went too far. That is why he wore that ring to his grave And most of those 35 men loved him. The movie depicts a legendary 70 year old coach nervous like a school girl ready to meet these men 25 years later. He doesn't know how many would be there or how they would respond to him. Most were there and most were successful in life and credited junction with preparing them for that success.

It is uncertain how bryant's legendary status effected the opinion these men had of him 25 years after the ordeal. We do know that junction is not just an ""appalling"" story. It's a story worth telling.",1118016000,8,2099,4.4186046511627906
1893620,3,B00009W5F7,"Tom Berenger shows his talent as a great character actor as legendary coach Bear Bryant, but I found the story to be still more evidence of the horrible expectations of athletes in sports by coaches and the dreadful pressures athletes place upon themselves to succeed. I found it hard to believe that Bryant's proteges could show so little resentment for the outright TORTURE and ABUSE to which they were subjected in the name of ""Championship Team."" Still, this is a true story, and if the real players feel that way.... as a parent, though, I'd have ripped Bryant's lungs out. Recommend for the history and the fact that this is, indeed, a true story.",1098662400,3,653,4.7368421052631575

7993575,1,B00009W5F7,"I purchased Jim Dent's book on the Junction Boys about a week ago and tore through it.  Before I had even finished it, I knew that I wanted to watch the movie...which I couldn't find anywhere online: not on Amazon, not on Netflix, not on Hulu, not on HBO...you get the idea.  I ended up ordering a copy, which took quite a bit of time to arrive on my door.  I sat my sons down and we watched it the same night.

It was bad, I'm not even sure that I have words in my vocabulary to describe how poorly executed and ill conceived this film is.  Had ESPN been thinking, they would have made this like a 4 part special and made each episode 60-90 minutes.  Instead, it begins very ambitiously by introducing some of the cast of characters, the team rolls out to junction where the bulk of the film takes place and then the film ends abruptly.

I highly recommend skipping this movie and reading the book.",1496880000,2,899,4.252941176470588

7993581,5,B00009W5F7,Superb film that can be hard for some of today's people to understand. Being coddled does not truly work in most cases. Pretty much anything that requires a team effort (sports to military) can only obtain success from trusting your other partners and knowing each others strengths and weaknesses. To obtain this level it is necessary for the teams to go through some truly intense situations. Yes you can be TOO hard as this film even shows (some of the real people claim it was not to truthful on Bear and he was not as mean).,1477353600,,528,4.510416666666667
