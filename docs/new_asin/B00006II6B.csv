8384344,3,B00006II6B,"Nothing on the cover indicated that i was dealing with a thriller-COMEDY here, so i was surprised to find out during the movie.

The whole storyline combined with some good acting performances should have been a perfect setting for a great thriller. But the humor is too subtle to make it a comedy. Some funny meant lines here and there,just enough for not spoiling a good suspense-drama. But during the film it gets worse and worse. The unnecessary and forced stupidity is increasing but the drama also. The story actually makes you angry about the injustice done. But at the end i don't know whether to laugh or to cry. Too much slapstick to make it a serious action-thriller-drama.

Still a nice rent though.",1108944000,,711,4.725806451612903

There's a motorbike pursuit that's really kick-..., the whole film kicks ....",1042588800,4,219,4.641025641025641
