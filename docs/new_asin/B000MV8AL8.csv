8172570,2,B000MV8AL8,"I've owned this DVD watched it and sold it. The DVD has a small songbooklet in it. He plays a song and then more slowly goes through it. There really is no ""technqiques"" in this program. He plays an electric guitar and most fingerstyle masters prefer acoustic. The guitar sound lacks the prescence and depth of an acoustic. He has a kind of emotional distance from his playing that does not appeal to me. I would rather hear someone playing something simple with complete emotional attachement to it than advanced player playing something advanced that is ""cold."" He plays Stever Wonder's Superstition on this but I think Pete Huttlinger's version is better. Again, my main problem with this program is the claim to techniques you will learn from it and there are none.",1299542400,3,769,4.7894736842105265
