3955413,5,B002N57KGM,"Never before has any show (or movie, for that matter) so perfectly depicted the imperfections of the human experience, and never before has a DVD box set been compiled so beautifully or lovingly. HBO has really outdone itself with this box set, and not one corner has been cut. The set feautures all five seasons in their original individual packaging (only without the outer slip-covers) as well as an extra book featuring Fisher family obituaries and both soundtracks, all cased within an inspired gravesite box. I couldn't be more impressed with this set, which does beautiful justice to the most touching and heartbreaking show ever made. Go ahead and treat yourself; life is short.",1163548800,,686,5.026315789473684
3955414,5,B002N57KGM,"I am so glad that I only own Season 1 of ""Six Feet Under"" on DVD! HBO charges an insane amount of money for its DVDs, and I had a feeling that if I held out long enough, the entire ""Six Feet Under"" series would be available as one awesome DVD collection...and I was right! The cost of this DVD set is much cheaper than it is to buy each season individually. In addition to the unbelievably cool packaging, this DVD set includes several featurettes, deleted scenes, cast interviews, and a series retrospective. Perhaps the coolest feature about this boxed set is that it also comes with the two outstanding ""SFU"" CD soundtracks, which I already own and absolutely LOVE! What a great added bonus. This will make a great holiday gift for any ""SFU"" fan...I hope someone is nice enough to get it for me!",1161129600,110,798,4.472602739726027
3955415,5,B002N57KGM,I have seen every episode of this show. I can honestly say that there is not one bad show in the bunch !!!!!! It is very well written and acted. One of the smartest shows to ever hit the airwaves. I have been waiting for a gift set since the series went off the air. I am very happy that it is finally here. This will make a great holiday gift for all the SFU fans. I can't wait to get mine.,1160524800,13,391,3.7804878048780486
3955416,5,B002N57KGM,"""Six Feet Under"" was the first television series I ever watched. The things that caught me first was the main title sequences and death scenes at the beginning of each episode. I kept on going to every episode on the list and watch each death only when I had HBO on Demand (I did this before the premiere of the fourth season). Working my way up the list of episodes, I finally got to the pilot episode and waited for the death scene. When I saw a guy in a funeral hearse, who I learned ran a funeral home, got hit by the bus and Ruth starting to act crazy, I got sucked into the show. I loved the way this show plays comfortably with the topic of death. It was dramatic, emotional and funny all at the same time. The tone of the whole series was really appealing to me. I kind of thought that living in a funeral home was great (living in one like ""Fisher and Sons"" maybe). From the first episode to the final episode, I truly loved every single minute of it. The Fishers felt like real people. Their problems are so complicated and interesting. You feel like you wish you could help them. Their problems are so tragic and so complicated to escape because they have such flawed lives and they have the inability to fix them. The story set in a funeral home and the topic being about death are reasons why I think they have issues. The casting is perfect. Nate, David, Ruth and Claire really look like a real family. The acting, writing and directing are excellent. The first season made me learn things about life and death. The stories were very original. The first season finale, gave me an obsession with death when Nate finds out he has the possibility of dying. The second season, being my favorite, was better than the first. It was more dramatic and funny. The Fishers encounter more complicated problems. The dead bodies are continued to be used as a mirror of the character's thoughts. And the thought that the series could've ended right there with Nate passing away, had me waiting (for three more years). The first two seasons made me think that this story would last forever. The third season focused a lot on the characters. Even though less dead bodies were talking, less funny moments and more drama, it was still enjoyable to watch because I've become so close to these characters and I actually cared about them. During the third, fourth and final seasons, I felt that their problems would evolve into something more of a darker tone. With Nathaniel Fisher dying in the pilot, there's another death we find out about at the end of the third season. The fourth season was the darkest and it was kind of slow for me but had a few episodes that really had very great stories. The final season was the climax season of everything that has happened in the first four seasons. The last five episodes of the final season really hit me hard. I became emotional, even right now. I would never feel the same thing towards anything else because this series had great storytelling. This series from start to finish was really entertaining for me. It taught me a lot of things about life and death. I was so proud with the fact that it started with a great bang and it was able to remain for five years, ending with another great bang. You could say that this series was a great bang.",1157155200,31,3290,4.448675496688741
3955417,5,B002N57KGM,"I chose to review the whole series instead of one season in particular because for me owning or watching one or two season is like watching half of a movie. The reason is simple, it may be true that the two first seasons are the most entertaining and funny but for a character development series like this, the third season is the year that Alan Ball starts focusing more on each character instead of giving us a bigger picture like the two firsts seasons. Now we know about the technic aspects of the mortuary profession and in my opinion what's to come is more cerebral and complex because we know the surface of the characters and now we start entering their minds and we become more attached to them. What is wonderful about this series is that the character development lasts about 60 hours (5 seasons) so if well made, it's way better than a movie that gives us 2 hours of that and it is, in deed, well made. I love every season of this wonderful series and I think the payoff at the end of the 5th season is nothing less than a masterpiece of tv making. The last 3 episodes of season 5 are simply sublime and I've never felt so much emotions for a fictionnal work in my life. Some movies or books move me but when you live with these people for 5 years, they become almost like family. Another thing I like is that the series felt more cinematic than anything I've seen before, the visual is quite special for television and it made me think about silent movies a lot which I am a fan of. So I recommand 6FU to everybody because another great thing of the series is that character from every generation is developped from teenage to old age. I would say though that young teenagers may find it too complex and older people too offensive but if you're from 30 to 50 years old and you like character development and the visual aspect of movie making to make a point, you will love six feet under. This series will become a classic because it broke so many barriers and people will talk about it in 200 years. It's expensive but if you can afford it, it's a great document to have. Now 3 little complaints, there's not enough extras, the first 2 seasons are not widescreen and no english subtitles in season 1 , only spanish???? Apart from that, it's perfect.",1156550400,9,2263,4.3649289099526065

3955419,5,B002N57KGM,"I first watched Six Feet Under at my parents home as I do not have HBO at my own house.  After seeing a few episodes, I got hooked.  I have since purchased every season on dvd.  The series was absolutely incredible.  The series revolved around a family who owned and operated a funeral home. The stories were about their interpersonal relationships with each other, their outside romantic relationships and their dealings with their ""customers"" on the outside perimeters or each episode.  It was one of the best original television series ever shown on HBO.  Definitely worth seeing.",1145404800,9,583,4.958762886597938

Now about the show: Six Feet Under is one of the best shows I've ever watched. The writing is excellent. The cast is superb. It is not a thrilling or suspenseful show but, rather, a show about the struggles of life, including dealing with death. The characters feel real. Their stories are touching. Michael C. Hall as David is the standout performance, but Claire is my favorite character. The series finale is the best I've ever seen, hands down. It will make you contemplate your own mortality. So, if you are looking for an exciting watch, this show probably isn't it. But, if you are ready to immerse yourself in a story, get Six Feet Under.",1502928000,,751,4.611940298507463

3955447,5,B002N57KGM,"Six Feet Under is simply one of the best television series' ever. The actors were superb and the writing some of the best I've ever seen. I did not watch the show when it was originally on as I didn't have HBO, but purchased the complete series as a boxed set a few months ago. I think Peter Krause and Michael C. Hall are some of the finest actors alive today, and some of the other players were new to me. Each and every one was rich in the portrayal of their character.

Each of the characters were fully fleshed out and the storyline of a dysfunctional family intensely moving. When I reached the very end, I cried like a baby. The ending wrap up was marvelous. It is a story that haunts me in a lot of ways, and I am certain at some point, I will sit down and watch it all again.",1471824000,12,784,4.058064516129032

3955452,3,B002N57KGM,"Okay, I'm halfway through the last season, and I felt a need to express myself in spite of not having finished the series yet. It has been a binge session for me, and the first thing I want to note is that the characterizations are all so very strong - well written and well acted - that it almost feels that these folks have become a part of my life. The show's storylines are mostly engrossing and many lessons can be learned here. However, a bit more frequently than I enjoy I find myself reacting to the show with, ""what the hell is wrong with you?""  Or, ""why are you being so stupid?"" Or, ""real people aren't really so self indulgent, are they?""
  I started out being empathetic to all of the characters, but at this point I have to say that I've almost lost patience with all the stupidity to the degree that I might not finish the series. While I do think it is a relatively good series, (good acting, technically good writing)  I think that a major weakness with this show is the near lack of growth that most of the characters - other than Brenda, maybe Keith - have really exhibited throughout the years. In the beginning, Nate was such a great guy, loving and giving, and now he seems to have become almost as irresponsible as the rest of the gang. They still explode like little children, get in ridiculous fights, they still screw around on each other, they still make really bad choices....it goes on and on. If the people in my life went about their lives like this I might kill myself.  Maybe I'm just really lucky and have a community of extraordinary people in my life (and I do, actually), but I really hope that this is not the way very many people live.",1470009600,,1674,4.352564102564102

I have read several reviews claiming this series is in the top 50 all time greatest.

3955489,2,B002N57KGM,"This show started out very strong and caught my interest. I was hooked to the characters and storylines, and watched it in marathons. Then came season 3, and the whole thing took a dive. The entire season was ridiculous and irritating, and by the end of the season I didn't like a single character in the show, but felt the obligation to continue watching this train wreck to see how it all ended. When it did I was completely relieved to be done with it.

Nate, the older brother, is a self-absorbed, promiscuous manchild who hooks up with any female that crosses his path, despite his relationship status. David, the younger brother, was the initially stoic and closeted gay man who degenerated into the most deplorable stereotype, as he and his boyfriend opt for an open relationship and sleep with anyone they can find in the gutter, completely perpetuating the most disgusting stereotypes of self-centeredness and clingy insecurity. Clair is the gloomy wannabe artist baby of the family who latches on to any dysfunctional boy she can find, that is before she jumps ship and starts experimenting with girls. Ruth is the seemingly conservative mother who contradicts herself by ending up in the most bizarre and flighty attempts at relationships, including trying to seduce a pre-Office Dwight Schrute, followed by a whirlwind marriage with a boring old man who goes from mundane to having a sorted history of mental problems. And the incest between Brenda and her bipolar brother was beyond unnecessary, and even disturbing in the most unpleasant way.

The whole premise of Six Feet Under seemed to revolve around sex and crying. If this batch of pathetic losers were not sleeping with someone, they were having an emotional breakdown or fighting for no other reason but to do it. The writers on this mess didn't seem to know what direction to take any of the characters for more than 5 minutes, and they seemed dead set on making the viewer dislike everyone. Even the little Hispanic guy, who originally had the most healthy relationship than anyone, ended up cheating on his wife with a skank he met in a strip club.

Though the final season was slightly redeeming, it was too late. I felt more relieved by the surprise death of one of the characters in the season, though annoyingly they were still making appearances. I struggled to give this highly overrated disaster of a TV show 2 stars.",1436832000,3,2399,4.8321167883211675

3955504,5,B002N57KGM,"Full and total! The series is all there in 25 DVDs and 63 episodes. It is morbid but in many ways absolutely hilarious. Morbid because it only deals with dead people since it takes place in a funeral home. Morbid also because the family that owns the funeral parlor and the family of their Latino associate or partner are so taken up by these deadly and lethal circumstances that they lose their minds and their sanity that get locked up in some coffin. In other words their lives are nothing but a parade of hearses.

You will enjoy the four main women in this film who are so hysterical and so out of control that you could not spend five minutes with them without them jumping onto you for various violent activities from hitting you to beating you down, to humping you (that is called rape) and refusing any advances from you, men or women, after they have captured your attention and now they detain your bodies. The best one is in the first episode, Mrs. Fisher, the mother calling her husband who is driving a hearse right then to tell him to crush the cigarette she is sure he is smoking, which is true. He does so and gets another one out and when he tries to light it up he runs into a bus. Good morning Mr. Reaper.

It is hilarious when you are confronted at the beginning of each episode with the death of one, two or three, or even more, people who are going to get into the mortuary. You cannot imagine how people can die. There are some berserk and completely insane ways of doing it. Dying is a fine art.

It is hilarious because one child is made by accident out of wedlock and another after many attempts and even a miscarriage. The elder Fisher son is responsible for the first accident and he marries the woman who used to be his best friend in high school or college, or whatever. But one day she disappears and many episodes later the truth will come up: it is so sordid that it becomes hilariously impossible. Then the poor Nate, Nathaniel Samuel, will finally marry and have a second daughter with the woman he met in the first episode on the plane from Seattle to Los Angeles on Christmas eve who dragged him nearly forcefully into the rest rooms or some other cupboard to have a kinky episode of rump riding on the sly in the fast lane.

That relation is just plain absurd. It is marrying fire and water or lemon juice and milk together. It gets sour in a jiffy and they break up and then they go back on the sly, and they announce a first marriage and they have to cancel it and then they will announce a second marriage and that will end in death and sourness. But what a trip around and around the maypole, you can see what I designate with this fairly friendly English device called a maypole with hams and other prizes at the top, if you can climb that high!

Imagine now the younger son who is a closet gay man who comes out of the closet without opening the door that is locked up anyway and they seem to have thrown the key away. He is just as much wavering as his brother about what he is looking for, who is looking for, and many other issues. These two gay men (plus a few more sidekicks) are making everything difficult, even kissing or holding their hands. And they only want to have children, and that too is an adventure. If you do not laugh it's because you are slightly tight on the gay side. It's never gay offensive but it is gay hilarious. You might be influenced into getting gay for the fun of it and the great enchanting vivid trip into wonderland and along the yellow road of bricks.

The sister, the youngest Fisher child, is even worse. She goes to art school and she starts having adventures. She is attracted by a lesbian woman and yet at the very moment when she should get active she panics and steps back. Imagine the situation. The lesbians actually are those who are shown as most distant from the core of the story. They remain marginal and unimportant.

The mother and her lovers are by far the best. The mother wants in order not to want and to reject what she wants and is begging for without accepting it when it is offered to her on a platter. She is a Salome of some sort. She is afraid of any kind of amorous and sentimental bodily contact. And she is an obsessive compulsive cleaner and ordering busy beaver chasing dust, dirt and disorder. She is straightening up everything, everybody and everyone with her own crooked and twisted desires and she wonders why people are gesticulating around her when she whips them up and down with a cat-o'-nine-tails and pretends it is thorn-free roses.

Enjoy the trip six feet under and be sure of one thing: there is no ladder to climb out of it. That's a real treat to die and it is a tearful great extravaganza for those who survive and have to inter the bodies in a way or another, even throw them to sharks if you can.

3955516,5,B002N57KGM,"I started watching Six Feet Under a few episodes into the first season and was instantly hooked by the interplay between closeted homosexual David Fisher (Michael C. Hall) and the ghost of the dead Mexican gang-banger.  The topic between the two was courage, the courage for David to come out as gay.  The writing, the concept, the stories, everything is perfectly compelling TV.

Every set, shot, and scene is expert in the Hitchcock way.  It is a bit like watching the classic, Vertigo, where San Franscisco is shown it all its glory.  In this show, Los Angales is shown in all its glory too.

The show follows a very creative family who are in the funeral home business as well as those that family loves and interact with.  The light falls upon the Fisher family on the day Nathaniel Fisher Sr. dies and then continues for several episodes after Nathaniel Fisher Jr. dies.  The show therefore features the five years in which ""Nate"" returns for Christmas and gets swept up in the operations of the family business, and then dies unexpectedly himself.

It is important here for this review to discuss the key characters:

Nathaniel Fisher Sr.  (Richard Jenkins).  He is only shown living at the start of the show, or through flashbacks.  He was a medic in Vietnam and had to marry Ruth while ""under the gun.""  In the show he interacts with the characters as a ghostly figment of their imagination.

Nathaniel ""Nate"" Fisher Jr. (Peter Krause).  He is the central character in the series and, this is important, he never grows into a better person through the show.  As will be explained further, Nate represents the Narcissistic aspect of the human condition.

Billy Chenowith (Jeremy Sisto).  Billy is brother to Brenda.  He has serious mental issues and Jeremy Sisto's portrayal of the highs and lows of a mentally ill person constitute the best acting in the series.

Ruth Fisher (Frances Conroy).  Ruth is the widow of Nathaniel and the dutiful wife, mother, sister, daughter, grandmother, and granddaughter to all.  She is high strung and emotional and occasionally makes bad decisions.

Brenda Chenwith (Rachel Griffiths).  Brenda is the highly intelligent daughter of two wealthy and prominent psychologists.  She was the subject of a study that was detailed in a popular book called Charlotte Light and Dark.  Brenda is resentful of her upbringing and, we will discover, is also a narcissist with addiction issues.  Brenda's character development will be contrasted with Nate below.

David Fisher (Michael C. Hall) and Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick) are a gay couple described here for together for brevity.  David is the boss at the funeral home, and was a closeted homosexual for many years.  He is the more feminine of the pair.  Keith is a very manly black cop who doesn't get along with his father.  He is grumpy and not ""gay"" in the usual, stereotypically gay way.  David and Keith have the most serious of problems in the show and they handle the problems with increasing grace, maturity, and excellence.  For, example, David guides the business, and with Keith fosters and turns around two children.  David is kidnapped and ends up with PTSD, which he deals with.  Keith is a cop, a security guard, and he is able to deal with his sister's addiction issues and family problems.

Claire Fisher (Lauren Ambrose).  Claire is very artistic, she does too many drugs, and often lashes out from a simple, hipster-fashionable morality, i.e. ""corporations,"" ""Support our Troops = Blood for Oil,"" etc.

George (James Cromwell) & Maggie Sibley (Tina Holmes).  George is Ruth's second husband and Maggie is George's daughter from a prior marriage.  Maggie is a character which emphasizes Nate's Narcissism along with several other themes of the show.

Joe (Justin Theroux) A love affair partner of Brenda.  Extremely important to Brenda's development.

There are also more characters, all of whom are very important, but they are best described within the themes of the show.

The story of course is about the essence of life and death, but there are more important themes here that need to be explained.

Dialectic-

Throughout the series characters interact through dialectic, is life a series of random encounters where there are no boundaries, no God, no morality, or is there something higher?  Every argument and dramatic conflict between characters brings about dialectic, and possibly truth.  Thesis plus antithesis equals a synthesis of (perhaps) objective truth.

Homosexual World View-

This show is extremely sympathetic to homosexuality, but it is sympathetic only from the viewpoint of gay men.  As a result there is an ambiguity towards women, and a hostility towards lesbian women.  There are three lesbian characters, they are all seen as unjust, and judgmental.  Only one is pretty and she storms out of the series after pressuring heterosexual Claire to have sex with her.  The other women characters such as Vanessa Diaz, the stripper Sophia, and Lisa Kimmel have their negative, manipulative, judgmental, and nagging traits shown for all.  The female rock star that seduces Keith is the very epitome of womanish negatives.  Indeed, it is part of a trend in HBO, where women are seen not as powerful women of the feminist ideal, but more like shrewish harridans.  The show Hung is most extreme in this outlook.  There is also much sympathy for male sexual needs.  David gets a prostitute, there is promiscuous sex with David and Keith, much responsible pornographic use, and anonymous or partially anonymous  sex in semi-public places. Ted and Claire make out in a supply cabinet and Brenda and Nate first have sex in a janitor's closet at the airport.  The only flaw is mixing heterosexual sex with homosexual sex.  Most heterosexual women don't do it with strangers they just met in closets in public places.  This criticism, should not say that the Homosexual World View is wrong at all-women do scold, nag, etc. All of this is to say that women are portrayed from a view of gay men, not feminists.

The Protestant Civil War

It could be true that all cultural clashes in America can be traced back to the writings of 17th Century English Theologians.  Within America's Protestant Culture there are two different wings of religious thought, one a fierce Puritanism, and the other a tolerant Spiritualism .  Six Feet Under occurs at a time when one, more Puritan, faction of American Protestantism, specifically the socially conservative, ""born again"" variety (called Christian in the series) of Evangelicalism took political control under George W. Bush in 2000.  This version of Protestantism is contrasted with the liberal, God of Love Protestantism of the main characters. Nate's in-laws are some sort of Unitarian-Universalists, Maggie is a Quaker, David is a practicing Episcopalian.  For everything there is a season.  During the Sexual Revolution of the 1970s society suffered from many problems, divorce, AIDS, etc, and it is likely the Religious Right was a good antidote to the decay.  In 2001, when gays decided to have sex within the bonds of same-sex marriage and adopt wayward children, the socially liberal brand of Christianity might be a better fit.  All is dialectic.

Narcissism-

It is important that the series shines its light on the life of Nate in LA between 2001 and 2005.  Nate meets his soul-mate Brenda on an airplane ride into LA.  They hit it off and have sex in a supply closet. (This is a plot development written in by a gay man here).  Brenda helps Nate through the death of his father.  The two start a relationship but Nate and Brenda are extreme Narcissists.  Brenda connects with bad people, has affairs, and does drugs and other irresponsible, self-absorbed things.  Nate does the same thing as the series progresses.  His worst move is to impregnate Lisa Kimmel (Lili Taylor) while on a trip to Seattle. Nate then must break it off with Brenda, and marry Lisa.  Lisa turns out to be a horribly insufferable person.  She is manipulative, shrewish, passive-aggressive, and a first class kill-joy.  When she disappears, killed it is strongly implied, in an adulterous fit of passion by her brother-in-law, Nate spins out of control.  Nate should feel deep relief that he has an honorable exit to a joyless marriage, but instead his self-absorbed mindset sends him into fierce self-pity.  He reconnects with Brenda.  Brenda meanwhile, has gone into counseling for her issues, has changed her career to match her high IQ, and has met Joe, a talented French Horn Player who she wishes to have children with.  Her old ways make one last attempt to pull her down.  She has an affair with Nate again.  When they are caught by Joe, he expresses, in a well acted, well written scene, to Brenda his regret that he wished to have children with her.  Joe is a very important character, he holds up a mirror to Brenda and she gets her life together as a result.  She takes care of Maya, marries Nate and eventually becomes successfully pregnant.  We see later that she mothers and raises three girls. On the other hand, Nate never gets above his narcissism.  His marriage to Brenda is stormy although Brenda is not the terror that Lisa was.  Nate is inconsiderate to all and he wishes to divorce Brenda after a one time fling with Maggie.  Nate seemingly doesn't understand that his relationship with Maggie might become even be more awful than his one with any of the other women.  Nate's death is more beneficial for the Fisher family than his continued living.

The show continues on with its excellent dramatic pressure-filled writing, Brenda goes into labor early, and Nate appears as a ghostly figment of imagination which plays on Brenda's fears.  Nate's ghost is comforting to his mother, and ambivalently helpful to Claire.  The last scene shows the final lives of their characters in a surreal, fast forward moving play that reminds the audience of their own mortality.

Dysgenics and a Flaw

The series is excellent, the dialectical aspect of the show makes adulterers, faithful people , liberals, conservatives, straights, gays, and anyone else under the sun appear to be sincere and loving as they really are trying to be.  Ted is an excellent conservative answer to Claire's art-house liberalism.  But there is one very minor flaw.  George Sibley being needy and mentally ill does not carry out well.  James Cromwell is an excellent actor who appears like he'd be an anchor of stability for the Fisher family other than his know-it-all ways.  I believe the dramatic dilemma of George would have been better served with a different flaw, but I hesitate to say what it would be.  Either Cromwell is miscast (not likely) or his problems developed by the screen-writers is wrong (likely).  There is also a dysgenic aspect to the show, that is featured but not fully commented on.  David and Keith successfully adopt two ghetto kids who turn out well in the show, but in real life, I suspect that such a thing won't turn out well at all.  The fake obituaries for David and Keith discuss grand-kids, but there are no grand-kids of their own.  There is a sort of Rescue Negro to this, where a white progressive gets several blacks and shines his love on them, which they gratefully receive and use to benefit society.  It's all fantasy though.  In truth because of this adoption and sterile gay sex the Fishers get replaced by alien outsiders in their very own house.  Claire (perhaps because gay men are writing this) doesn't seem to feel the pressures to have children before it's too late.  She dies alone, surrounded by her art, but not her family.  The last scene is both happy, especially for Brenda, and sad for Claire...

...all is dialectic.",1424649600,,11715,4.919346605410924
3955517,1,B002N57KGM,"I found this programme to be way, way less than the sum of its parts; the first series came as a breath of fresh air; it was humane and witty, well written and beautifully produced and acted. I really came to care about all the main characters, their difficulties, their hopes, their trials and their triumphs; it played with interesting themes around mortality, immortality, love, sexuality, life and death.

Series two brought more trials and difficulties, less humour and hitherto unsuspected and wholly unbelievable character flaws in certain key characters; still, it didn't pretend that life contains no hope at all, and as such still held the seeds of being potentially life-affirming and realistic.

From somewhere around the series 2 or 3 point however, the script writers seize upon every opportunity for self-redemption as a means for one character after another to cop out and look down into the drains, or their navel. That's it ... nothing else happens.

Six Feet Under morphs into a soap opera of Eastenders-scaled dreck. Thinly and poorly conceived plot twists about sex and death multiply; every one of them with the sole purpose of grinding down the integrity of each character. A sledgehammer is taken to the scripting to ensure you understand that no-one in Six Feet Under-land ever possessed either heart or moral compass. Indeed, only libido is real, and that only in the shadow of death and depravity; no-one escapes.

The living characters and individuals we meet in Series 1 all become lumps of humping meat or non-humping psychosis (hold on, maybe it's a Bodysnatchers sci-fi/horror number where the original characters are subsumed by alien forces and motivations ... ).

Six Feet Under is really a drag; it's purpose appears to be to annihilate rhyme and reason. And fun, for that matter.

It's like a hungover breakfast with Richard Dawkins, Billy Graham and Kurt Cobain (and only a half-used tin of tomatoes in the fridge, no bacon and no butter). Cheerless.

I confess I never got to Series 5; maybe they turned it all around but in all honesty it became impossible to care about any of the characters or any of their fates; they'd all become either self-obsessed nihilists or wet as lettuce.",1424476800,2,2223,4.959677419354839

SFU is the best TV HBO dramatic series that I have ever seen. Prepare yourself with a quantity of time and quality of honest emotions brilliantly portrayed by the Fisher family. My favorite character is Nate whose heart and head work in tandum with each other making him relatively more stable.  Maggie and Billy  are the most annoyingly pathetic characters. Billy""s mother negotiated with Clare to stay in the relationship even though it was clearly unhealthy for her. He was too weak to express himself because of mental instability. Maggie was mostly watered down, ineffective, and understated. I felt relieved when she finally realized that she didn't belong so she moved away.  The ending was the best that I've ever seen. I was glued to my TV with tissues in hand and insisted on quietness in the room. I watched it several times to pick up on details.

I watched all 5 seasons in  3 weeks! I had heard about this show years ago, but was put off by the Funeral Home base where it all began. 3 weeks ago I saw it up on Amazon Prime and checked out the 1st eppy. I WAS HOOKED! Immediately!
Today I watched the Series Finale and when it was over, felt a little sad, for I had grown attached to the Fischer Family.
This also was THE BEST Series Finale I have ever watched. It was well done and there were no questions as to what really happened, and who did what like other series seem to do.",1413072000,,705,4.035714285714286
3955542,5,B002N57KGM,"This show has so much going for it that it is hard to believe that anyone who likes quality tv would not love it. This is the kind of show which HBO has ""made"" its reputation as the gold standard for excellent tv viewing. The show revolves around a family business which started out as a Mom & Pop (Fisher) and now has grown to pull in the grown children. There are three. They all live in the family funeral home business in Los Angeles except for the oldest son, who returns to them on the very first episode of season one.

There are the usual battles over which, if any, family members will continue the business. The gay son has been doing so but he has problems, not the least of which is that he is not very talented at it. His older brother has more charisma and his assistant has more talent, especially with ""making up"" the bodies so they display well. This assistant eventually will want to either be made a partner in the business or he will switch employers. This tension is also inevitable in family owned businesses when the children don't have all the needed talents to carry it on.

Every episode starts with a death which leads to the use of the funeral home. We also deal with the issues which that death has brought about plus the overall arc of the family's issues and tensions moves forward. The mother of these children is still living in the house too and she is played the wonderful Frances Conroy, who has gone on to the tv show ""American Horror"". Her teenage daughter and thus the sister of the two sons is played by Lauren Ambrose. She is an artist who will never fit into the undertaking business. The other two brothers are played by Peter Krause and Michael C.Hall. Krause was expected to be the big star but after this series, Hall went on to become Dexter on Showtime, which made him the biggest star to emerge from this series.

The eldest brother takes up with the daughter of two psychiatrists who has a borderline crazy brother, Billy. These two are played by Jeremy Sisto and Rachel Griffiths. They and the two shrink parents are priceless every time they are on camera.

This show also has one of the best endings in all of series tv. Whereas so many shows end with real clunker episodes, this one concludes brilliantly.

Although through part of the series the views are pretty liberal (""artist"" as profession, gay couples, california, bashing bush and republicans as a whole, liberal feminist women, etc.) but I pushed through it to the end. Finale was one of the best I've seen.  If you are looking for a new series and don't mind a left leaning writing team/acting, I would recommend this show.",1398297600,,626,4.63963963963964

From is deep exploration of the meaning of life and death to its exploration in to the minds of incredibly realistic and human characters, there is nothing else quite as good.  With big hit shows like The Wire and Game of Thrones giving HBO it's name, this is truly it's hidden gem. I was weary going in, not sure how much I would enjoy a show about a funeral home.  But as I kept watching I realized that this show was less about the funeral home and death and more about people and life.

I recently sent it in as a trade-in since Amazon and HBO will not allow me to sell it here as a Marketplace item.  My invoice indicates that I bought it new.  My boxed set looked exactly like the photos and description on this page.

Apparently Amazon sent me the wrong item and noticed the error when processing the trade in.  Wish they would make good on their original error.  Seems that Amazon should check the ISBNs when sending out items as well as when they are traded in.  The item is marked in my trade-in account as ""returned, rejected, wrong item"" but I don't know if they will actually return it as I indicated ""do not return"" as the return option.  I would not select that option again.

This TV series is well worth purchasing.  I watched the full series twice and think season one is the best but decided to sell it as i have that season on iTunes.  I would give the series three stars and HBO and Amazon's procedures zero stars so there it is: a one star wonder.

Edit: update

I see that today the best trade in deal would be up to $8.50 whereas when I submitted mine they were offering $18.00 for good condition. They did return mine but in traveling to and from the KY trade in center the condition has deteriorated:  there is now a big box cutter slice along the edge of the outer box and the fan-like book that holds the CDs is bent on the edge of every page.",1390694400,,1462,4.234657039711191

I find myself getting uncomfortable with certain things that happen in the series, but I love how the characters grow, and how, basically, they are all good human beings.  I find I like it best when I watch a bunch of episodes in a row.  I end up wanting so much for things to go right for the characters.  I got a big kick out of looking up ""Nicolai"" (who I have seen before on who-knows-what) on IMDB to see that in real life, he had been a boxer and otherwise-athlete that normally had ""bruiser"" roles, and that he loved doing this series.  I do think the acting is superb in SFU, so I ended up looking up all the main characters in hopes they were still working, which they were, so that made me happy!  I've seen several Dexter seasons, so I knew Michael Hall was still working, and I saw a couple of Camp episodes earlier this year, never realizing that the star of that show was the brother's (Nate's) girlfriend in SFU.",1388707200,,962,4.287292817679558

It was an incredibly creative way to close out this wonderful show.

I now enjoy some of the stars in other things - Rachel Griffiths in 'Brothers and Sisters' (another great show), Frances Conroy is now in 'American Horror Story', etc.

I avoided watching it for years because it seemed like a rather morbid topic for a show, but once I stumbled upon it I was hooked. I was in college the first time I watched it and would spend my down time marathoning it. It had been off the air for about a year at that point. Most of the characters are so easy to connect with in one way or another and I've found that as I've grown older, I feel a different connection with them when I do watch the series again. I've watched in two more times in its entirety and it's been really interesting to see how my perspective has changed over the years.

3955622,5,B002N57KGM,"This is not just a TV show.  This is an exploration of the human condition.  Six Feet Under taught me that life is beautifully unpredictable, that the connections we make with people go deeper than we realize, and that everyone's got a story to tell.

The Fishers will stay with you.  They are the most realistic, fully formed characters I've ever seen.  You will, at some point, love every character and be furious at every character.  Like real people, they are flawed, haunted, and fantastically quirky.  The show does a brilliant job of going into their heads to the point that you might feel like you know them better than actual people you know.  The cast is stellar, and there are sooo many great guest stars.

SFU is a heavy show that will force you to think and reflect.  That being said, it's also quite hilarious, with humor ranging from dark to absurd to downright silly.  There's plenty of interesting imagery used and the soundtrack is exactly what it needs to be.

Basically this show is perfect and everyone should watch it.  Every episode has quotable lines and the finale will make you sob.

It was well worth it. After watching the series, I felt like I knew the characters personally, as I got to know so much about them and their motivations. The show is also a lesson about life and living. Although the focus is on death and funeral industry, the real message is about what we do with our lives when we are alive. This is one of those rare series in which viewers' lives are enriched, if they pay even the slightest attention to the messages of the show. I am not going to discuss characters and plots; that can be found in so many places online.

The father, Nathanial (sic) Fisher, portrayed by Richard Jenkins, is my favorite character; when I would see his name on the credits, I knew a truly great character actor would be there to deliver lines to savor, followed by his trademark cackle.

3955639,5,B002N57KGM,"Although not being a soap opera viewer and much less a TV series expert, I'd like to give a big THANK YOU to all the people who made this series possible.

After seeing Six Feet Under one feels as if one has seen much more than just a TV show and it leaves you with a lot of stuff to mull over. Besides an amazing acting, directing and production, I think the series gives a wonderful portrait of a wide array of different sorts of outsiders and how they once and again struggle to fit in a ""normal"" world which, at the same time, is becoming more and more corrupt and anemic (you have to bear in mind that it was filmed almost ten years ago!), and that's what I think gives all the characters a very special and powerful human touch and magnetism I've never come across on TV before.

Throughout the five seasons the series deals with a lot of different subjects and is a unique mixture of drama, humor, psychology, sex, violence, irony, nihilism, gory touches, art, drugs, soap opera, illness, human emotions, life, death... all this settled around the life of a family of undertakers and all the relationships they maintain with the others and (not least!) with themselves.

All in all, it makes up an outstanding display of our western human condition at the beginning of this century brilliantly captured from an everyday and ordinary life standpoint that, without knowing when and how, manages to open up to the highest and deepest insights into human life... Seen with an open mind, no doubt you'll end up crying and laughing with the Fishers like you never did before in front of the TV! Absolutely recommended!!

Thanks again!",1363305600,2,1635,4.608247422680412

From the heart-rate-obsessed runner getting eaten by a mountain lion, to the acid-head actually jumping off a rooftop, to the main character's thwarted fantasies of coming out, to the adoptees who pull a knife on their foster-parents, the creators take deadly aim at everything one holds harmless, dear, or liberating.

Someone dies at the beginning of each segment, and the Fishers handle the funeral.  This is a perfect drama for death-denying Americans.  No punches are pulled, with very little off-limits as the Fishers struggle with one another and with their partners and friends as they explore life in Los Angeles, which includes sex, drugs, and the latest in awakening workshops.  Often funny, the story also brings tears.  Mostly it makes it impossible to deny that we are all dying and now is the time to live and forgive.",1353369600,,861,4.816326530612245

3955677,4,B002N57KGM,"I am a straight man who has had a number of amazing homosexual friends. This is something I am proud to say as I am more proud of my friends. But Alan Ball? Okay, Alan...you took arguably a top 5 show of all time and made it only a Top 20. Why? Because your hate for women is so obvious it cracks me up.
To wit:
1. The most functional couple on the show? A gay couple.
2. The women on the show: Ruth, Lisa, Brenda, David's ex...all handle issues badly. They are mean to the men in their lives while the man are just confused. The way Ruth treats George? Deplorable. Brenda is always cheating, Lisa is always crabbing. Claire is the olive branch for the women and even then, in season 4, she is a self righteous, credit stealing wench for a while.
3. Look at the men? George? Mentally ill who by-golly tries hard. Nate? A guy who changes his life to be a good family man. Hell he cheats after he feels badly treated - not a good reason, mind you. The gay bashers? Worst ones are women. Ruth cheated on Nathaniel, Brenda cheated on Nate, Lisa was probably cheating with the brother in law, etc. etc. etc. Hell Rico, cheated only (and not really badly) after Vanessa basically began blowing him off and becoming a wreck.

The list goes on and on. But I mean look at American Beauty? The women were nutz the men had a point except for one - oh wow a gay-bashing closeted marine - gee.

True Blood? The women are even more annoying than the men...again.

Alan...being gay is fine...being a woman basher is not.
At least you proove that many of your ilk are conditioned and not ""born.""

Great show with a mentally ill writer.

Make sure you check all of the discs the best you can. Mine were in pretty good shape except for the very last disc on the series ending episode. Just before the very last 10 minutes of the final montage, the disc froze and shuttered a bit.

3955680,5,B002N57KGM,"I remember watching the pilot of ""Six Feet Under"" way back in June 2001 (God, how long ago that seems) and marveling at how good it was. There were only a couple of things about it that gave me pause -- it wasn't that I didn't LIKE the fake commercials for mortuary products, but I did think they harmed the tone a little bit. And I wasn't sure about the characters; some of them, including younger Fisher brother David, seemed rather selfish and self-absorbed. Overall, though, every element was good -- acting, script, direction, characters.

Yet I really don't think I believed at that point that ""Six Feet Under"" would become one of the best TV shows of all time, or that it would emerge as my personal favorite over all others. That's right -- I believe ""Six Feet Under"" was THE greatest drama in the history of television. The show ""found"" itself very, very quickly; after just three or four episodes, I knew it wasn't something I ever wanted to miss. And it just got stronger, season after season, for four years.

This set presents all five seasons, and if it doesn't qualify as ""keeper"" home theater, I don't know what would. Well, the blu-ray version, I guess. Anyone know when we might be getting that?

For all my enthusiasm about the show, I can't say I ever ""fell in love"" with the Fisher family. They were too dysfunctional. Ruth, the mother, could be very uptight. Nate, the older son, came off as one of those folks who project confidence but are tormented inside. David seemed to be playing the role of the dutiful son who stuck with the family funeral business that Nate fled, but as I've observed, he also could be quite selfish -- without even realizing it. And Claire, the daughter ... poor Claire. Confused, angry, experimenting with drugs -- a true teen-aged misfit. (Then again, aren't they all? Isn't ""teen-aged misfit"" redundant?)

But that was the great thing about the series: It presented a family that was real. Their flaws helped define them, just as our own mistakes and missteps and shortcomings help define us as human beings.

The characters outside the family circle were just as good. Keith, David's partner, struggling to get David OK with the idea of coming out even though David still felt a need to stay in the closet. Brenda, who begins as nothing more than a fling and ends up in a serious relationship with him. And the ghost or image or ... whatever he is ... of the recently deceased Nathaniel Fisher Sr., the family patriarch who is killed in the pilot when his brand-new hearse is hit by a bus.

I could say all kinds of good things about this show, but what its considerable appeal really came down to was the characters. Eleven years after saying goodbye to them, I still miss them. I still think about them; it's as if they are among the people I've lost to death in the last decade or so.

Purchase this set and watch this show. I doubt very seriously you'll be disappointed. And when you get to the series finale, savor it -- it's probably the greatest series finale in TV ... oh, you know the rest. But don't skip ahead to it. Watch every single episode that precedes it, in chronological order. That's the only way to get the maximum impact out of this show. Trust me. You'll be glad you did.",1341187200,2,3248,4.541880341880342
3955681,4,B002N57KGM,"This is a great series, no doubt about it.  What I am reviewing is the packaging and special features, etc. on this DVD collection.

1.  This has no music (CDs).

The other ""gift box set"" has both soundtracks.  I don't know about you, but I really liked the music on this show.  So I bought that separate.  Cost me roughly $10 with shipping and handling for BOTH CDs, which I was very pleased with.  I definitely wanted that.  If you want it all to come in one set, I suggest getting the gift set.

2.  Paper sleeves have a tendency to scratch DVDs.

This is a personal preference thing.  I just want to protect my stuff, and I don't think these protect as well as the plastic cases.  Yes, WAY more space efficient, but I'd rather have the protection than the space efficiency.

3.  The commentaries are the best from Allen Ball.

The creator of the show, who also wrote ""American Beauty"" (which I highly recommend), made the most interesting commentaries.  The other writers are... not as interesting.  At least not to me.  There's a fun one with both Michael Hall and Lauren Ambrose in season 5.  And they were just like little kids or teenagers making commentaries and having their own awkward moments during their time on the episode, which is wildly funny to me.

4.  English subtitles throughout.

I like watching TV series with subtitles. It's a lot easier for me to digest and the original DVDs did not have English subtitles on the first or second seasons.  That really bugged.  My Spanish isn't all that great, so the Spanish subtitles didn't do it for me.  But here, English subtitles are included in all seasons.  SCORE.",1337644800,2,1632,4.572916666666667

It really is the best drama of all time. Yes, The Wire & The Shield & Deadwood might be close, but this series really is amazing from start to finish.

3955720,5,B002N57KGM,"Six Feet Under is a series which takes place in a family owned funeral home. It is brilliant in every aspect of its production. I liked it so much, that when I had to leave the full series in storage to live with family, I bought another full series, if that is any indication of my opinion of the series. None of my family, nor their friends would watch this - they would be mortified.

I liked it because it did not back away from any ""taboo"" subject. One subject focused on heavily is sexuality. They showed open homosexuality, which should be shown more often as the majority of Americans would get used to the fact that it is natural.  The next area was promiscuity. One man dies from auto-erotic asphyxia. Moreover, there are incestuous feelings between Nate's girlfriend Brenda initiated by her brother. Also, heavy drug use pervades the series.

There are graphic physical scenes as well. For example, a work accident of being chopped up in a mixer.  So one must have a strong stomach to watch the series.

Then there is the Fischer family.  One of the primary characters, Mr. Fischer, the father of the clan, is killed in the first episode and re-appears frequently as seen through the eyes of their teen-aged daughter Claire and his grown sons Nate and David. However, his wife cannot see him after death.  They have an assistant, Rico, in the embalming laboratory.

The series weaves in and out of their struggles, that are somewhat unusual; after all, it is a funeral home.  But if you keep an open mind you may be very entertained; if you already have an open mind, then buy at least series one, and if you don't even want to hear any profane words, believe that sex outside of marriage is a sin, that homosexuality is an abomination, then don't go any further than this review.",1317945600,2,1791,4.571875

Yes, I (now) realize the character Michael Hall plays is gay but the displays are just too much for us old folk... for individuals who don't condone this life style.  I purchased this series because I enjoy Dexter so much; I'm disappointed in Six Feet Under, though.  If I would have known the language is as it is - the use of the F word seemingly ALL the time (I can live with a lot so not a complete prude), and that David Fisher (Michael Hall) is gay and that life style is so ""in your face,"" I would not have purchased this series.  Nevertheless, I do like the theme of the series, how the characters are developed and interact, the lines with deep meaning... yes, they are there, and the humorous situations.

Hall plays David Fisher, and this series is the first time he had ever done anything behind a camera (he was previously a NY stage actor).  Hard to believe it was his first role like this, because he is incredible.  I always heard that the series finale was one of the best in television history... let me tell you, it is THE best I've ever seen.

Six Feet Under also gives a completely accurate depiction of the funeral business, personal grief, and dying--all without being grotesque or morbid in any way.  I was always hesitant to watch the series before because I don't deal well with death, dying, or gore on television.  While usually these events would send my emotional anxiety on hyper-drive, Six Feet Under actually presented these issues in a realistic and natural way, just like life.  If you haven't seen this show or watched it in it's entirety, you're missing out on an incredible entertainment experience!",1305417600,8,1569,4.580645161290323

There's not one negative thing to say about this show - the writing and acting were always superb, and the characters were so richly developed and fascinating.  The show really explored so many ideas and themes, and truly made me think - not many television shows do that anymore.

3955741,5,B002N57KGM,"I just finished watching this whole series within a span of 3 weeks and I was very moved. The characters are some of the most complex characters you will find on a TV or movie screen and the relationships are very engaging.

When I first tried to watch this show, I couldn't watch it for long. After forcing myself through the first episode, I just couldn't see why this show was viewed as one of the greatest TV shows ever. I kept watching the show in 10 minute increments, convincing my that I have to be missing something. How can the buzz for this show be so great and I not see its beauty? Well, I obviously came back to it hoping to see what made this such a great show. By the 3rd episode, I couldn't stop watching. It was so addictive, so well-written, and kept me glued to my TV. It is the only show which I would yell out to the TV when something crazy would happen during the episode.

""No, don't do that...come on, Nate, don't let this happen to you...Run...don't run off...""

I just finished watching the series finale and it was the most moving series finale I have ever watched.

3955742,5,B002N57KGM,"""To make life important.""  This is but one small quote from the brilliant dialogue of Six Feet Under. This show is tv perfection. No other tv show I have ever seen has come close to dealing realistically with mortality, relationships, and family.  Alan Ball brilliantly wrote this series about the Fisher family who owns and runs a funeral home. As in real life, these characters are flawed people who make mistakes and share triumps along their journey of life.
 My husband and I were glued to our tv on Sunday nights when SFU first aired. After buying the series and rewatching it, it is even more powerful now. We are ten years older (and I'd like to think wiser) and can relate even more to the storylines now. The series finale, is the single best ever done for a tv show. Do yourself a favor, and buy this tv series. It may change the way you live your life, and see the world.",1299974400,4,883,4.404907975460123

It was a brilliantly woven tale of plots (no pun intended), sub-plots, complex characters, great acting, great writing and great visuals. I could not stop watching it and when it was over, it was over. Fantastic. Really gets you thinking about your own life and living it day by day.",1299369600,2,360,4.553846153846154
3955745,5,B002N57KGM,"All right. I gave this five stars because this show is absolutely phenomenal. It took me a year to finish the series, mostly because I had to take breaks in between. It's a show that affects you mind and soul, and doesn't shine over the messy, insane things that people do. You hate some of the characters, and you love them. It's rare that there's a character who you are indifferent about. To me, that's the sign of amazing directing and acting.

Although the series experiences a change of pace after Season 2, that doesn't stop it from being the same gritty, witty show that it's always been. A lot of people I know didn't like it much after that, but I kept with it.

Overall, it's one of the best productions I've ever seen, hands down. Although there are realistic inaccuracies regarding the mortician profession, it is much more accurate than you'd think. But it's a fictional show, and it plays like one.

If you can handle a show with dark humour, depressing themes, raunchy dialogue, morally ambiguous characters, and gory depictions of life and death... Then this is for you.",1297555200,,1087,4.651041666666667

3955747,5,B002N57KGM,"After watching the series finale of Six Feet Under, I can't help but realize that I just got done watching arguably the best, most life changing, groundbreaking, honest shows to ever grace a television screen. For the first time ever for me, a television show became something much more. I found myself having to confront issues of my own mortality, look more intently at how I am living my life, and make adjustments to the way I view the world around me. This show was that powerful.

On two separate occasions during the final season, I found myself not just crying, but literally weeping because I had grown so used to the characters; and due to the amazing acting I had come to identify and relate certain characters to people in my own life. The very last show of the series is most likely one of the best series finales in television history. It was so absolutely appropriate and fitting to the show that even though I was watching it by myself, I found it neccessary to stand up in my living room and clap. If you haven't seen this show... buy this package now and watch it from the begginning, you just do not know what you are missing.

I envy people who have not seen this show yet, because they get to experience it for the first time. Bravo to the creators...5 stars easily.",1296172800,4,1287,4.4491525423728815

3955777,5,B002N57KGM,"Although ""Six Feet Under"" is a series about the owners of a funeral home, the show about death teaches us so much about life. Through the brilliant acting of Frances Conroy, Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, Lauren Ambrose, etc., the audience is drawn in to experience first hand the trial & tribulations of the Fishers. Yes, the show is very sad at times, but so is life. But when this family experiences joy, we do too.

3955778,5,B002N57KGM,"With the end of the series it's great to see a complete box set of this superb show. Each season gave us highs and lows, as well as dark humour and touching, poignant relationships. The way it covers the various issues of death is refreshing and you really became involved following the lives and trials of the main characters. The seasons had many story lines, from the illness on one family member, to the development of another's art career, to the various boyfriends of Ruth (the mum in the series) and way more besides. What better way to celebrate one of the most original series to come out of America in years than to buy, watch and enjoy this outstanding boxset?

This series captured life as it is and death as it ultimately defines everything. The last episode was unbelievably perfect. I really thought it would be difficult to end this series in a great way, but the writers proved there is really nothing dramatically they cannot do.  the ending in my opinion was phenomenal.

The mother was my favorite character and favorite actor-a truly complex and unusual person",1292716800,,581,4.908163265306122
3955783,5,B002N57KGM,My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the whole series. We just recently found out about it on hbo on demand then ordered the series. This critically acclaimed show is wonderful. You get so wrapped up in the lives of the characters. I don't usually find myself thinking about a TV show the next day as if the characters are real! So many wonderful actors and story lines. The show is racy and deals with hard issues. It pushes boundaries but in a tasteful way (if that's possible) like no other show I've seen. It covers all faiths and political views. I will never look at death and funerals the same again. Amazingly this show will help me deal with loss and watching it in the future will probably be a comfort when that time comes. I also want to do a pre-need contract to specify what I want at my funeral to take the burden off my family. The finale was one of the best ever and left you with closure (I hate when a show leaves you hanging) on their lives.,1291852800,,974,4.298913043478261

My daughter and I bought the set to watch a younger Michael C. Hall. It's really a time capsule that accurately portrays the life of gay men ten years ago. Some were out of the closet and some very in.",1290038400,,419,4.371794871794871

It truly is a show worth watching and having your own copy of!,1288569600,,402,3.9753086419753085
3955798,4,B002N57KGM,"First off, this show, is in my opinion, the best of all HBO programming to date. Many come close, but I think this one has all the right elements to make it a truly unforgettable series. If you don't know the basic plot, it is about the members of the Fisher family, who run their funeral home in Los Angeles. There are 7 main characters, with guest stars from time to time. Each season covers a different year in the lives of these people. The show focuses on death, and the different types, such as emotional, mental and physical. The show is exceptionally well written, produced and acted. The finale was one that was so beautiful, I remember every major aspect of it, just forn watching it once.

The price for this series is very reasonable, compared to other HBO complete series, which everybody knows carry a ridiculously hefty price tag. For less than 100 dollars, you will be able to enjoy a life-impacting series that will forever be a part of you.

Now the packaging. The packaging for the current version (the previous, bigger version is discontinued), has its ups and downs. The packaging is slimmer, less than half the size of the previous box set. It is in a ""book"" form, with each disc consisting of a ""page"". There are more pictures included in the second version. The only down side is it does not include the 2 CD soundtracks, which had phenomenal music included. Also, it doesn't include the cool-looking fake grass with a 3D tombstone at the top of the box, like the first version of the box.

Overall, the packaging is great, the discs are kept safe, and it takes up less space in your dvd collection. But of course the content is the same, which is the most important thing.",1288483200,2,1697,4.53921568627451

The characters are all so vividly portrayed and multi-dimensional; you can't help but want to keep watching to find out what happens to them next. It covers so many issues, from death to homosexuality to bipolar disorder to drug abuse to infidelity to teen angst, and so much more. It is funny, moving, and above all engrossing! The strong language and some of the subject matter may not be appealing to everyone.",1285718400,,590,4.422018348623853

However, when I ordered this it did not come with the booklet or the 2 CDs it was supposed to. The seller was very helpful in trying to make it right by either giving me a full or partial refund, but I didn't want to go through the hastle and besides, it was the manufacturer's fault. Plus, I have come across a couple of discs that have something on them which cause the discs to skip and freeze and whatever the substance was just won't come off. I destroyed one disc trying to clean it and had to go out and buy season 2 just so that I could see that last 2 episodes.

3955805,4,B002N57KGM,"I just spent the last 8 weeks watching this with my partner. We fell in love with the show and enjoyed the series immensely. The characters are wonderful and the acting is top notch. It was hard to let them go as the series came to an end.

I would say the first 2 seasons are the best and the last 5 or so episodes of the last season too.
I think the show loses it's way for a while and stops blending humor and drama and goes a bit overly soapy/angsty for a while but eventually gets back on track.

If you are looking for a series Drama about life and death and the ups and downs of Marriage ,mortality and surviving life, than this is the show for you. It was also refreshing to see a realistic dipiction of not only Straight couples and the problems they must tackle together on an every day basis but also a gay couple which I have not seen realisticly portrayed on TV without the stereotyping.

Hats off to Alan Ball and the Actors and writers of this show. It's now one of my all time favorites.",1282348800,,1003,4.133333333333334
3955846,5,B002N57KGM,"I don't have HBO, so I come to all their series late. Six Feet Under caught my eye initially as a re-run on some random cable channel.  I was hooked enough to borrow the discs from my library and watch all the episodes.  What a wonderful example of the trial we all go through in death and in life.  I liked (and disliked) all the main characters at one point, but there is no mistaking their humanity, the way that sometimes we too are all afraid or eager or disappointed in our life and struggling to be who we really want to be or just trying to figure things out.

The ending (which I won't spoil here) is one of the best series endings I have ever seen.  It is sad, it is touching, and it is 100% appropriate to the show and it's subject: the Fisher family and death.  I would watch this series over and over for it's love, it's family, and it's frank discussions on death and how we all deal with it.",1281744000,3,906,4.119318181818182

3955849,5,B002N57KGM,"I was never very interested in this show for a few reasons.  First, the name of the show made it sound a little morbid, and second, I am not a subscriber to HBO.  I began watching the reruns on UniversalHD which were severely cut for cable television.  My interest in the show was almost immediate.  As I looked online to purchase one season at a time, I came across the complete series which was actually cheaper on Amazon that each of the five seasons individually.  The packaging is great and resembles a picture book.  It has photos of many of the monumental scenes from each season on the pockets that store the DVDs.  Also included is an ""In memoriam"" booklet that details the lives of each of the main characters beyond the series' finale.

The series itself is one of best written and directed programs that I have ever watched, especially season 4, my favorite.  There are always ongoing sub plots that are so well incorporated into the episode that they never take away from the story of the person who has passed on and whose funeral will take place during the episode. The series' finale was without a doubt one of (if not the) best endings of any show ever. Watching some of the DVD extras was really incredible.  The directors take us behind the scenes to show so many of the special effects that were used throughout the series.  All in all, it was some of the best entertainment money that I have ever spent.  My only regrets with this purchase (and the series itself) are: first, that I waited so long to open my mind enough to buy it and second that the series had to come to an end.",1280102400,3,1601,4.426621160409557

3955851,1,B002N57KGM,"Great show! I loved the series and had to have it.  However, do not buy the smaller boxset.  Buy the larger one instead, with the obits and CDs.  The DVDs in the smaller boxset come in sleeves.  There weren't enough sleeves, so four of the sleeves had two DVDs crammed into them!  This resulted in the ink from the bottom DVD to transfer to the silver side of the DVD stacked on top of it.  This caused three of the DVDs to be completely unreadable!  The larger boxset is organized by by season and each disc is protected by its own panel.  (See customer images on the other boxset).

In addition, I copy the DVDs to my media server so that I can watch them without getting up to change the 24 discs.  I noticed that the DVDs on the smaller boxset are only single layer discs, 4.7GB.  The DVDs on the larger boxset are dual-layer discs, up to 8.5GB.  The content is the same, but of course the material on smaller boxset has to be compressed to fit on the lower capacity discs.  I did not perform any side by side comparisons of video quality, as I had already returned the smaller defective boxset, before buying the bigger boxset.

Buy the larger boxset.  It's beautifully and well packaged.  The video is less compressed.  The larger boxset has been discontinued, but it's still possible to find new from various sellers.  It is more expensive, but it's worth it.  Great show!  Everyone should watch it!",1279324800,84,1406,4.460629921259843

The prestige and influence of HBO original programming is such that upon discovering this cheaper re-release of the ""Six Feet Under"" series in early 2010, I bought it without having seen so much as a single episode. I hadn't checked out the program before because what I knew about the series didn't sound particularly interesting, but as with all great fiction the hook that sells the show isn't so much the plot as it is the characters.

""Six Feet Under"" is an hour-long drama series about the Fisher family, who operate Fisher & Sons funeral home in Los Angeles. In the first few moments of the pilot episode, the Fisher family patriarch Nathaniel is killed in a tragic accident, and the audience is at once thrust into the affairs of the surviving Fishers and the continuing aftermath of Nathaniel's death. Each episode briefly details the day-to-day operations and struggles of running a privately owned funeral home, but the primary focus is always centered on the trials and tribulations within the Fisher family. In the pilot, oldest son Nate (Peter Krause) has just arrived from Seattle for a visit, middle son David (Michael C. Hall) is a closeted homosexual who takes over the funeral home after his father's death, youngest daughter Claire (Lauren Ambrose) is a troubled and confused high schooler, and their mother Ruth (Frances Conroy) is a deeply unhappy woman formerly resigned to her fate as a simple housewife.

Other major players include David's boyfriend and police officer Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick), restorative artist and Fisher employee Federico Diaz (Freddy Rodriguez), Nate's eventual love interest Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths), and her brother Billy (Jeremy Sisto). The supporting cast is equally as impressive as the principals. Some of my favorite character actors such as Rainn Wilson, Ben Foster, James Cromwell, Catherine O'Hara, Mena Suvari, Justin Theroux, and Richard Jenkins have recurring roles. No less than three ""Deadwood"" regulars have small parts, and even the future Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) both make appearances (though not together).

The cast is uniformly excellent in these roles, helping to gloss over the occasional character inconcistencies present in certain episodes. Nate is perhaps the most uneven, variously alternating between extreme compassion with strangers and extreme self-absorption around his loved ones. There's painstaking detail devoted to his relationship with Brenda, most of which is quite well-realized but occasionally stifles the pacing of certain episodes. David and Federico are, without question, the most likeable characters. David's continual struggle, gradual acceptance, and growing comfortability with his homosexuality is by turns heart-breaking and heart-warming to watch unfold. David is masterfully portrayed by Michael C. Hall, and it's a testament to his abilities as an actor that he can so adroitly convince the audience he is a mild-mannered gay man as well as a cunning serial killer on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter/dp/B000Q6GUW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Dexter""</a>&nbsp;with equal aplomb. Federico's boyish looks and charming naivete earns him the most compassion through his own struggles, as he aims to provide more for his family than just a modest living.

Claire generally follows a rather pedestrian path of teenage self-destruction and angst, though it bears noting this is the fault of the writers and not the talented actress Lauren Ambrose. The writers script her character as if she inhabits some higher plane of individualism because she's a 'deep' artist, while one of her boyfriends is portrayed as ""unhip"" because he listens to Top 40 radio and supports the war on terror. It's as if the series itself is perpetuating the juvenile notion that it's a penchant for the obscure that sets forward-thinking people apart from the hordes of conformist drones. As for Ruth, it's a genuine joy to watch her never-ending quest to find true happiness, as she branches out in ways she never did before her husband's death.

That, of course, is the thread that unravels all the cobwebs and skeletons in ""Six Feet Under"". It's through Nathaniel's demise that the Fisher family is gradually able to transform, over five seasons, from dysfunctional family-in-name-only into cultivating thriving relationships between each other. As they come to terms with their loss and the realization that none of them really knew who Nathaniel was, they're forced to realize through his death what truly matters in life. Though the start of the series is a bit slow and occasionally rocky, the series quickly grew into what I've come to expect from an HBO program: top-notch cast, killer dialogue, a good mix of pathos and humor, and a myriad of interesting plotlines. Thematically it is quite obviously a platform for exploring the way people deal with death and, by extension, life. The other major themes revolve around characters coming to grips with homosexuality and attempts to understand and live with mental illness.

Every episode, with but a few exceptions, opens with the last moments of a future Fisher & Sons client. These deaths, mirroring reality, range from the mundane to the horrific. Sometimes a red herring will be employed, misdirecting the audience into believing one person will die only to realize it is actually someone else's time to go. Within the microcosm of the program, this is a great way to illustrate how unpredictable and surprising death can be. Occasionally a cleverly scripted series of events will culminate in a fatality, like some sort of cruel Rube Goldberg machine only God finds amusing. A few are even, dare I say it, amusing in their absurdity. Unfortunately, some of the idiosyncrasies native to the series aren't quite as clever as the writers appear to think they are. Case in point, another narrative device the program employs are surreal moments of a character acting on their most private thoughts. These can range from an emotional outburst of screaming, to characters bursting into song and dance, to one character blissfully shooting her ex-lovers as if in some sort of bizarre carnival game.

When it is necessary to provide clarification, particularly following a extreme outburst of emotion, the scene will jump cut to moments earlier, illustrating that it never actually occurred. At times this can present confusion, with the audience wondering ""Which part actually happened and which didn't?"" Even worse, sometimes a truly shocking event will occur, only to discover once again it never really happened. This can feel like a slap in the face to the audience, as if being toyed with or mocked by the writers, akin to the controversial last moments of the ""Sopranos"" finale. Most of the time, however, the scenes are sufficiently over-the-top enough that it doesn't ring of conceit so much as a clever manner in which to convey the internal thoughts of the characters. Yet another, more effective, method for exploring the internal conflicts within the characters has main cast members speaking to the dead as if they were alive.

This complete series set is beautifully presented in a series of paper DVD sleeves assembled like a book. This isn't the most protective method, but is a greener and more compact way to package the series. The two soundtrack discs included on the previous complete series edition are not enclosed here, but the small character booklet is. If you're new to the series, I strongly suggest not reading the booklet until you've watched all the episodes. Regarding the packaging, out of twenty-four discs, I only had a slight skipping problem with one disc. Otherwise all episodes played perfectly and the majority (but not all) of them were scuff-free. For the admittedly modest price I paid, I really have no genuine complaints in this department.

""Six Feet Under"", again mirroring reality, will not tie up every loose end, and not all lingering questions will have a definitive answer. There are a few plot threads that build incrementally only to dissolve into nothing. There are patches of weak writing, such as the puerile and impotent stabs at political commentary that betray the otherwise superlative scripting. The series does get lost in its own creativity at times, and sometimes gorges itself on certain characters who are not quite as interesting as their screen time would suggest. But, ultimately, what prevents ""Six Feet Under"" from a full five stars is that there are significant amounts of extraneous filler peppered within the series, particularly in later seasons. I feel that this series should've been four classic seasons instead of five excellent, but slightly bloated and overwrought seasons.

I can promise this: you will find yourself caring deeply about these characters, you will find your heart racing when things aren't going as you had hoped, and you will find yourself staying up much later than you had intended to squeeze in one more episode. You will also discover one of the most satisfying television finales ever conceived, during which each character finds some place of stable contentment, bringing warm smiles to the audience, until those final ten minutes when the series delivers an emotional gut punch that perfectly summarizes the entire idea of the series. Watching those last moments unfold, I kept thinking of something Nate said earlier in the series: ""Everybody dies. Everybody. What makes you so special?""

Definitely- while watching these discs I've had a few hiccups here and there.

3955956,5,B002N57KGM,"I thought I would chirp in and give my endorsement to this series. As far as the packaging of said series, really, as far as I'm concerned if the discs work and are quality transfers, I'm not too critical usually.

Show-wise, this is one of the best, most thought provoking and challenging programs I have ever watched. I just finished the last episode a few hours ago and I am still in kind of a state of shock at how much I have been affected by the five season story of the Fishers. This series is top tier HBO quality, setting a benchmark that only the best of the best can ever achieve. And usually when they do, it is only for a season or two at the most, but Six Feet Under maintained top notch writing and acting throughout.

A word of caution: If you are sensitive to controversial issues such as homosexuality, or get queezy with sexual content, this MAY not be the program for you. My mom, for example, would probably not make it through the first episode. If you feel that House and CSI are the pinnacle of television achievement, then Six Feet Under may be too far of a reach for you. But, if you give it time and an open mind, you may come around!

I've been waiting a pretty long time for the price of the bigger box set to go down and I regret not buying it when Amazon was selling it for about $88. Now it's discontinued which I'm really frustrated about. If you try to buy the bigger box set anywhere else it's at least $95.

SCRATCHED. I was pissed off as hell. I didn't do anything to them. I just took them out carefully and there were a couple of scratches on some of them.
So I'm pretty sure they were scratched before I got the box set. So far, most of the scratched dvds played out fine except for a couple.

As a television series - wow... I'm only a few episodes in and I am hooked.  I never had HBO, so unlike some of the other reviewers, my first experience watching Michael C.

I don't know why they took away the audio CD's in this set vs. the old set--however, they are not the reason I wanted the series and I would not be that disappointed to not have them.  They can be purchased separately if you are serious about having the music.

While there is at least one death at the beginning of the show and the show takes place mostly in a funeral home, there is plenty of humor, excitement, entertainment.  There is (as with many HBO shows also a lot of language and sex).  Every show is very well done but since there is a storyline of following the family, it is best to watch in order.

The scene early in the series where Nate discovers his father's secret ""getaway"" room that was given by a client in leiu of payment for services, and Nate envisions all the crazed and insane things the old man might have done there, is truly memorable.  The main actors also have fantasy interactions with others deceased, both loved ones and funeral home clients, and I'll bet it's no coincidence that this same concept is used with similar effect in Michael Hall's current series, Dexter.

The last 10-15 minutes of the final episode, where the future is projected for all the main characters while Claire is driving off to seek her dreams, is one of the most emotionally stunning segments I have ever seen on TV or film.  If you can watch it without getting an enourmous lump in your throat or tears flowing, you have more control than I.  It is exquisite almost beyond description.  There has never been a series that closed on a more poignant note, bar none.",1259107200,,1302,4.833333333333333
3956000,5,B002N57KGM,"I knew from the television reviews and award shows that Six Feet Under was something special, but we don't subscribe to HBO or Showtime, so we miss out on a lot of such phenomena until we watch them on DVD. We recently began renting SFU from Blockbuster, but after the first episode or two we were addicted and couldn't wait for the mail rentals. I purchased the collector's edition instead, with the notion that we'd watch all 5 seasons this fall and then give it away as a Christmas gift.  Well, my teenaged daughter and I devoured the dvd's in less than two weeks--and now I'm not sure if we can part with the set!  This series is groundbreaking (pun intended)and I understand the acclaim.  I concur with all the praise for the creators', directors', actors' and writers' talents. They've created real people here--and these folks stick with you!  We actually MISS every character now that we're done with the series.  We continue to ponder their lives, motives, and even their futures.  The final episode gives them a life beyond the series, for which we are grateful, but we can't help missing them.

So I break it down: 1) the script is unbelievable.  If you haven't watched an HBO show in the past please do so; with that in mind know this is the best HBO ever written. I don't know who the writers were, but they planned all the seasons out to near perfection. 2) Two of the episodes have never left my mind since I first finished the series in 2003: When Nate had to bury the bones of his wife he had so-so feeling for and the kidnapping episode; those alone will have your jaw literally dropped.  3) The scenarios that are played out really hit home to what could be real life situations, such as Nate being married while all along having the ultimate passion for another. 4) In so many ways, it will make you rethink the way you live your life.",1253577600,,912,4.101123595505618

3956038,1,B002N57KGM,"By now, my fellow amazon readers, if you have read my previous reviews you would have seen that I am fascinated with shows that are rich in character development and detailed plot-lines.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under-The-Complete-Series-Gift-Set/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set</a>&nbsp;was seemingly the perfect choice for me; a show that was very detailed, with realistic characters and multiple plot lines, all revolving around a funeral home.

Unfortunately, that could not save this show from being pretentious and ""overrated."" I wanted to like Six Feet Under as I enjoyed watching the relationship of David and Keith evolve, fell in love with the youngest Fisher daughter, Claire (I have a thing for very artistic women) and enjoyed watching the constant struggle of Brenda (sister to Billy) and Billy to reconcile how messed up their lives were. But that was about it, as the rest of the characters were so common, they ruined the show for me. Nate Fisher, was a typical son who struggled to escape his ""destiny,"" to then be forced into the family business, as a result of his father's death. Ruth Fisher, matriarch of the Fisher family, was an annoying/doting mother who struggled with the death of her husband by pestering her kids. Rico, the ""underling,"" was an unnecessary addition to the show and it would seem that Alan Ball (show creator) was forced to make him a partner in the funeral home so as to keep him on the show. Do not get me started on Lisa, as she was an unfortunate addition to the the show and one of the main reasons for me to dislike Six Feet Under.

At this point you can see that there were many instances when I wanted to throw my TV out the window, because I so was disgusted with the direction of Six Feet Under. This is exemplified by the beginning of the third season, when Nate all of a sudden marries Lisa and was no longer seeing Brenda. I kept on screaming ""Why Nate? Why go with Lisa and not Brenda? You two are not meant to be together."" Prayers were said and I was hoping that the first couple of episodes of season 3 were a dream. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This completely ruined the show for me.

To think, that the same person who created True Blood, could create such utter rubbish was baffling. I would only recommend Six Feet Under so as to watch the acting of Michael C. Hall, Rachel Griffiths, Jeremy Sisto and Lauren Ambrose as they were excellent.",1250640000,15,2519,4.894613583138173

This five season series deals with a family which owns and operates a funeral home.  It basically deals with their lives and relationships and offers the viewer one of the most compelling series I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  It offers humor, relationship issues, family, coping with death and life, and has insights into the human condition that will stay with you for days.
My girlfriend and I decided to put it in the player and we were hooked.  We spent weekends watching it pretty much until we got through the entire series.

3956128,5,B002N57KGM,"Six Feet Under is, at turns, awe-inspiring; disturbing; darkly humourous and unsettling.  Kind of like the experience of life itself. The characters that wind their way into your heart can both endear themselves to you with their capacity to struggle with some measure of dignity through life's profound challenges and then annoy you to the point where you wonder if you can put up with anymore with their misdirected anger; self-absorption and narcissism. Nate, for eg., could be positively inspiring with his insight and empathy for some grieving and injured soul. Or he could infuriate you with his blistering, self-righteous tirades against others who crossed him or that he did not understand, including the ones that he both loves . . . and betrays. Sometimes, it's all one big mess with no easy answers and a lot of not fully satisfied questions. Sometimes, we are easy with our fellow travelers and then, within a flash, very uneasy. Yet, we are are bound together in the mystery of life and, uncompromisingly, tied to its end. And there is something wonderful, despite the pain; the loss and multiple missteps. Six Feet Under succeeds because it comes closet than most TV series to unearthing what is real, unsettling; joyful and ultimately meaningful in our brief sojourn on this earth.

I also enjoyed the included booklet with ""obituaries"" for all of the characters, filling in some of the gaps in their lives that the series left open.

  How on earth did I live without the awesome HBO series I am watching now!?
  Where did HBO find all this talent?
  What undeniable truth that bringing in unknown talents and letting them loose will reap incredible results!
  Slowly, I am acquiring as many of them as I can.
  The Sopranos, The Wire, etc. etc...
  But Now..
  SIX FEET UNDER...
  Where to begin...?
  To capture the very essence of life on this planet and turn it into a living, breathing panoply of emotions protrayed by actors of a quality that is exquisite is not only breathtaking and refreshing but it grabs you and draws you immediately into the story.
  Oh, yes, it is graphic and rotten and appallingly obscene and rude and offensive and it tickles all the parameters of every prejudice and pre-concieved notion we might have, but folks...that IS LIFE!
  This one of all the HBO series particularly makes you realize that you can't run and hide.
  We must face life as it unfolds...with all its unpredictability and nuances, both positive and negative and just try sometimes just to survive.
  This is what Six Feet Under teaches us.
  Live life one day at a time, don't pretend to be anything you're not,
treat everyone as your equal and walk humbly in the Face of God!",1236211200,5,1451,5.218340611353712
3956133,5,B002N57KGM,"There's probably little I could say that hasn't been said by so many other reviewers.  I'd heard and read good things but I had no idea just how good it all was.  I was fortunate enough to find this box set in Amazon's ""Gold Box"" deals and picked it up for an insane amount of money.  Without a doubt the best $60 I've ever spent...and I think if something happened to it I would buy it for full price; It is that good.

I've been watching television for 30 years and this series finale (the final episode) was the best (and most appropriate) finish to a series that I'd ever seen in my life!  It felt so...complete.  It left me not wanting more.  Really, it encapsulates one of the main messages of the entire series; and leaves you at peace with its life and death.

Do yourself or a loved one a favor and pick this up or rent it; whatever it takes and become a part of the Fisher family.  But beware, a good amount of HBO raciness (or real life?) is there for those who may be offended by sexual content, both hetero and homo in nature.",1236124800,,1039,4.180904522613066
3956134,5,B002N57KGM,"Somehow I missed the SFU boat that came along in '01. But then I caught a few of Season 1 on HBO and was hooked. I had to get this!!

I can't think of anything more horrible than having to watch someone die and bury them. Be it a child, parent, sibling, or friend, the experience of death touches people in different ways. I think SFU explored about every aspect of death, how people relate to it, deal with it (or don't in some cases), and embrace it as part of life.

I connected with the Fisher's, as many people have. I knew their pain, felt their joy, experienced their rage, and still have a lot to learn about myself. The Fisher's have shown me that I'm not alone in my thinking, that there are other people out there who go through the same thoughts I do (even if they're just characters in a TV show), and whom I can learn from. Sure they work in a funeral home & meet people at their most vulnerable & weak. But the Fisher's, through their lives dealing with the dead, rip through the core of matters that people don't like to talk about. We see that even fictional life isn't perfect, and there are consequences for everything. We learn about what's most important in our lives, our dreams & desires, our family, ourselves. And it's what makes us human. We all will die.

I'm blown away by the acting in this series. Every single member of the cast (even those with only seconds of screen time) gives it their all & it shows. The writing is the best of anything I've ever seen. The music moves us to cry, to clothes our eyes and remember a time when that song played before, what life was like.

If you'd prefer a fantasyworld where everyone makes it out of the fire, no one ever dies, the hero always shows up just in time, and the villan gets what he deserves, then go somewhere else for entertainment. This show is as real as it gets, as ugly as it gets, as sad as it gets, and as beautiful as it gets. If you can handle the real world, in all its horror & joy, you won't regret a single minute spent watching the entire season. I just wish there was more.",1236124800,,2070,4.21969696969697

I saw it come up on Amazon as a deal of the day and couldn't pass it up.  I see why this show has a bit of a cult following.  It's great.  Maybe, just maybe they dragged out some of the scenarios w/ Ruth or between Nate and Brenda, but the show will keep you guessing with ""what if"" scenarios that only exist in the characters' heads, so when something actually goes down, you are waiting for that ""wake up"" moment.  People, this is not a feel good series.  I'm not saying happy moments don't happen, but this series has a hearty mix of drama/comedy/tragedy.  And you just don't see tragedy any more.  There is romance as well, so I guess this series touches all 4 forms of Greek play types.  All in all, I would totally recommend this.  I say as a series it held up better than Sopranos (which started off way better than this, but couldn't keep up its own momentum).  I only compare the 2 because they were on HBO.

Its dark humour, the repressed feelings about to burst out, these lovable yet out-of-their-minds characters, it was all so new, creative and just plain interesting that I couldn't wait to see more.
Then I basically devoured Seasons 2-5 in over a month or so; and by the end of it, I can honestly say the series had changed my perspective on many things.

3956191,5,B002N57KGM,"When ""Six Feet Under"" first aired in 2001, people were adamant about the idea of a Family-Run Funeral home, of which is supposed to make good television drama and with its satirical dark humour and very real characters. It seemed like a lot to gauge for a show that would constantly display death. Then again, death is a touchy subject to everyone, where do we go, what of the soul and more importantly, how we deal with it, and do we ever deal with it.

Funnily enough the idea for this show is original, who ever had the idea first wins in that respect; they get to clarify an unlooked upbringing of a Family Business and way of life for those who `cater' the dearly departed.

Result; This great show has introduced us to the Fisher Family. A lovable, quirky, witty retort type of what can be called ""dysfunctional"" clique, which would evidently be used as a comparison for future generations of TV clans.

You may think it would be depressing, when in fact the show is surrounded in clairvoyance. The episodic structure follows that of some random loved (or unloved) person dying at the beginning of the episode through to the eventuality that the Fishers are the one who take care of the recently passed.

The Cast; An excellently played bunch of mishaps that are such a winning clich with each other that they come together to depict an idea of family. Peter Krause plays older extroverted son Nate Fisher Jr., named after his dearly departed father who starts off the first series (season). Nate is not built for the job but finds that being drafted as funeral director may have its merits. Nate also introduces us to his on and off love of his life Brenda Chenowith (Rachel Griffiths) whom is an Australian actor with a killing worked state-side accent. She's a pious talking sexually inhibited deviant and we love her, and she develops into a wonderfully woven character.

Middle child now fully licensed Funeral Director David Fisher (Michael C. Hall) a character pushed into a business role vacated by a late father, but doesn't gloat and makes it worth something to him. He plays the in-closet Homosexual whom is seeing his supportive and well played character and partner to be Keith Charles (Mathew St. Patrick). The grieving mother and wife, quirky and lovable Ruth Fisher, played by Frances Conroy who's variety of theatre acting pays off every little bit. And finally the youngest Claire Fisher, played by the gorgeous Lauren Ambrose, who just about reflects teenage life without giving off the false sense of adolescence played by stereotypical teens in say The OC. The inevitable wild-child, whose dalliances with an array of class A substances give us a comedy and just all round fun experiences.

Families on TV, especially American TV could learn much from this, and have. It's easy to spot the similarities in shows like ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Dexter"" and ""Brothers & Sisters"". TV drama found a mark that explored more boundaries than Scott Bakula did in Quantum Leap, more frontiers than Star Trek.
It's hard to go back to the atypical TV-centred families of so called modern life. A dark satirical backdrop of a Family-Run Funeral home opens up a more accurate approximation of current life and all its density.

Verdict:

Short but sweet, stays with you like the memory of a loved one. 10/10. Six Feet Under, you will be sadly and forever missed.",1225238400,,3370,4.788296041308089

Plus, unlike other shows (i.e The Sopranos), the finial episode of this series didn't suck! It wraps up everything nicely and leaves you feeling satisfied not disappointed.

It's a great show and I recommend it 100%

One note of caution... One of the characters in this series is gay and there are quite a few scenes throughout the series that depict gay sex and gay relationships.

3956246,4,B002N57KGM,"I assume you have already come to terms (and made your peace) with the fact that SIX FEET UNDER is by and far one of the best-written television shows in history. If you haven't, all you need to do is watch an episode.

Let's talk about the Gift Set Box instead.

The box holds all 5 seasons: 25 discs (including 2 audio soundtracks) as well as a beautifully-executed hardbound 'memorium' that describes and reflects upon the principal characters (DO NOT READ THE BOOKLET IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE COMPLETE SERIES).

The box itself is large enough to hold the original seasons' in the original interior ""fold-out"" trays. The box itself is decorated on each side to look like fresh, healthy soil, complete with grass roots at the top.

The actual TOP of the box has fine, green astro-turf-like material attached to it, complete with a resin ""headstone"" in the center of the top panel that reads SIX FEET UNDER.

In order to get into the box, you open it from the side, upwards. This reveals the interior panel of the box and inside you are treated to what it would look like if you were laying in a coffin. The cast looks down at you respectfully, and each season slides out in its' own wallet.

All in all, an excellent presentation that is only slightly awkward due to the way you need to pull the side ""flap"" of the box up in order to get into it. I also have noticed quite a bit of the green ""grass"" comes loose around the edges of the set. These are minor quibbles. The entire case sits at the same height and width as other standard ""complete season"" box-sets, so placing it into your collection poses no problems. However, given the quality and presentation of this beautiful set, I would recommend finding a flat surface for showcasing the complete series instead of losing it on your DVD wall.",1218499200,10,1799,4.52

3956249,4,B002N57KGM,"I really love this show, so I bought the whole big box set and was really excited about it.  However, when I recieved the set, there were several issues.  I understand that big boxes like this may get damaged in the shipping process, but I don't believe it's a shipping issue.  The single sheet on the back of the box (the one with the set barcode and the quick summary of the set) was glued on to the box in a very sporatic way.  It looked like this label was intended to come off (there was a small dab of glue near the centre, about the size of a tennis ball, and no glue near the corners).  I began to peel this off, and it seemed to rip the outer packaging.  I have had similar HBO tv sets which have used this sort of temporary outer leaflet, and they were held with a softer glue, like the kind that attaches a new credit card in the mail to its envelope).  I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me whether I got some defect or if this is typical.  The other few things I am not worried about, but I though I'd mention them anyways:  the corners around the grass at the top of the box are torn, but not because of a ""shipping bump"".  its as if the paper covering the cardboard wasn't cut properly.  the last thing is the booklet in the 2CD soundtrack package was torn out of its hard cover book, but not by force...it is torn, but doesn't look like it was ever really attached.

3956278,5,B002N57KGM,"It's sort of bizarre, the ideal, that watching a TV show could be considered a milestone. But in my case its true (yes I know, I've got to get a life!). I've just finished watching the last episode of the box set ""Six Feet Under-The Complete Series Gift Set"". It took me a little over a year and a half to watch all 25 discs, which held 5 seasons, made up of 63 episodes (plus oodles of extras). In the last 10 minutes of watching the series, I bawled my eyes out like a little baby! Maybe I just watch to much darn televsion, but I love this show!

Why would a TV show about the dysfunctional lives of the Fishers, a family, that runs a Los Angeles funeral home cause such an emotional response in me? Isn't it just a TV show? Well yeah...but it is so much more! This show really represents to me, the pinnacle of how good television entertainment and storytelling in general can be. It really feels like you get inside the lives of the Fisher family and share a rollercoaster-like, emotional journey with them as they confront life, death and all the messy stuff that comes in-between.

This show is dramatic, funny, literate and really the best, that will come out of the TV medium. This is mainly due to the creative vision of Creator/Executive Producer, Alan Ball, who had the guts and the talent to pull something like this off. He hired an amazing cast of actors, who presented us with characters, who were multi-faceted and believable. They breathed life into scripts, that were both literate and entertaining, filled with depth and meaning. Even the more technical aspects such as cinematography, editing, special effects and use of musical scores/songs are consistantly first rate.

I think HBO has shown a great deal of care in releasing this series to DVD. The picture and sound quality are great. The DVD menus are quite creative and even beautiful. Each season has lots of extras, spread out between the twenty five discs, including a number of short documentaries and select commentaries from the show's directors, writers and actors. The commentaries vary in quality, the best coming from Series Creator, Alan Ball. This should be like ""mannah from heaven"" for any true fan of the show.

The individual DVD releases have now been packaged together in ""Six Feet Under-The Complete Series Gift Set"". This is the most economical way to own all 5 seasons. The packaging is a cube, that is made to look like a manicured grave/funeral plot. Its' pretty neat looking (and heavy!) but is also quite fragile and the design makes it a little difficult to extract the individual seasons. The gift set also includes a small memoriam book with character obituaries/photos as well as two previously released sountrack CDS (both fastastic!). If you don't already own the individual seasons, then this box set is highly recommended.

I was sort of sad, that I finished seeing all 63 episodes. Even though the last few minutes of the series are mind blowing, the show is addictive leaving you wanting more. But all good things must end. (I guess thats why they named the last season ""Everything Ends"".) Well, the great thing about DVD is that you can start it all over.

I started watching. It is what my generation used to call ""an experience."" In other words, I can give you some arbitrary description of events and so forth which might give you some sense of storylines, characters, etc. and it won't come close to what it actually is about - in particular what it is about for you.
  I've seen it now about 4 times. My boyfriend who has a hard time watching an hour of television in one sitting couldn't stop watching. After I got the series from Amazon we ended up watching nothing else. It was like a book he couldn't put down (and he's not a reader either). We watched the entire 5 years in marathon chunks until the end! Now he keeps saying that he misses the Fishers. Again, like a really good book that you hate to turn the last page on . . .

They assured me that they had several in stock so I got a gift certificate for another set and thought I'd be walking out with it. Nope, they have some sort of inventory quirk and then I found out they won't turn a gift certificate into cash-even if you have the original product receipt. (Their representative told me, ""You might just use the money to go and buy drugs!"" Huh?!) I got groceries for Christmas that year . . .
  I KNEW by buying it from Amazon that I would be able to return it, exchange it, etc. no problem! It is because I know that I have their guarantees that I have bought so many gift DVD's here. And THIS is the BEST PRICE I've seen it at - and I have been looking! (This is the only place that I found that you can get it home for under $[...])

3956330,5,B002N57KGM,"I watched all the dvd's, not including bonus features or commentaries, in 6 days. I was simply entranced by the sophisticated writing, the relevance of the plot and the complexity of the characters. I found myself going to the discussion group over at HBO to see what other people thought about those things i had questions about. During my headlong rush to see what was next i missed one episode and as i thought about it i knew something was unanswered and searched through the episode descriptions to find and eventually watch it. Which really shows a pretty good continuity and internal coherence to the series.
The first question i have is why invest 70+ hours in 6 days to watch a TV show? The short answer is that afaik this is unique.

It's more than the importance of the major issues: what is death? visions of our own mortality. what is life in the face of certain death? what does it mean to be family? what does committment mean? how do we go about fixing ourselves, making ourselves better as we age? what does it mean to a kid to grow up in a funeral home, with bodies in the basement, what does it do to them?

Much of it has to do with the complexity of the issues, the relevance of death and dying to me personally, the ability of the writers to really say something in so many hours of movie making work.
But mostly it's about me connecting to the characters, feeling as if the ideas presented are significant to me, that the questions posed are my questions that i need to answer for myself. Simply put, it spoke directly to me.

I am certainly a child of the TV era, but i am primarily a word and print person, my imagination is more captivating than any show can possibly be. I'm all about words, not so much spoken as written and reverberating in my head. So why did i connect so strongly with this series? Partly because i've reached the age where friends and relatives around me are dying, most of my parent's generation are gone, all of my friends from their generation have died. I've come to grips with most of the issues surrounding my folks death and my own impending mortality, so why is this such an continuing issue?

It's because the show is not only about dying, death, dealing with grief but it is about life and growing up in the shadow of death, living with the realization that death is in the basement. It is as if the authors had the Book of Ecclesiastes open in front of them the whole time they were discussing and writing the script. What is man that Thou art mindful of him?(Psalm 8:4) All is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.(Ecc 1:2-4) For the main theme is living in the face of death, finding meaning to go on alone in the face of grief, and how to bear the trials of this life, knowing you will die and your sacrifices and tears fade away as will your memory in those that remain (temporarily) behind. For funerals are for the living, but about the dead and rebuilding lives without them in it.

For me, primarily a religious person, these issues strike to the core of my faith, those things i have tossed about in my head for so many sleepless, agonizing dark nights wrestling with these things. But the series itself is not particularly religious, despite the questions asked being ""typically a religious type"" of inquiry. The major character-Brenda is thoroughly secular and often voices the viewpoint of a materialist faith that we poof appear, live and suffering, then die and are gone. She is sure that whatever the meaning of this existence, she will have to find it or invent it for herself, there is no god to impart saving knowledge, things just are. It's not that there aren't religious voices in the series, but they are peripheal, Buddhist monks chanting, Quakers sitting in silence, Black gospel singing and clapping at a funeral joyously, vigorously. But these are irrelevant to the main characters, something they see but don't participate in or think about. (Nate does think about Quakers, but the attraction is that silence is so different than the constant voices in his head, not that this faith answers his longings) So there really is no voice in the series asking and answering these great questions in the way that my faith community would do. So why connect with it?

So what does it mean to grow up with death in the basement? how do we come to grips with our own mortality and still be able to function in this world until then?
What does it mean to live in the shadow of death? How can there be meaning and significance to my life, when i will leave the world and everything i've worked so hard for, behind?

The series offers a few ways that the main characters answered these existential questions.
Claire has the escape from the pain and consciousness with drugs, with excitement and that adrenalin rush, but mostly the hope and satisfaction that comes from creativity, the wonder of expressing the artist and bringing your insides outside for all the world to stare at. Ruth has service and self sacrifice, the role of the suffering servant forever taking care of someone else, but she sees the problems inherent in not answering your own questions(this is the way my mom lived as well). David tries to lose himself in a self sacrifical love confused with sexuality and conquest, and devotes a significant part of his life simply to hard and careful work, his calling of a funeral director and later sacrificing for his family(this was my dad's answer). These are common alternatives and the writers do us a great service by laying out those pathways and their strengths and shortcomings. Allowing us to see and feel the path that each of them took, making these ways of living life in the shadow of death more visual and more viseral.

But it is Brenda's and Nate's lives that are the most complex, the most demanding, similar to the ones i struggle with. Brenda is intellectual, verbal, deeply feeling, rebellious, often just plain pissed off at everything and everyone in general. Nate is more emotional, more driven by passion and the escape of seduction, conquest and physical release, much less introspective, only dimly aware of what drives him, or what he really wants. But aware that things really aren't right but unable to connect with how to fix them. But neither one of them really achieves that intimacy that they crave, although for different reasons. Neither one can really sustain a relationship, to love without losing oneself, to sacrifice without regret, to give without hesitation or expectation that it will be returned. Neither one is really very happy, or content, rather both are fighting and frightened, angry and sad, confused but certain they are right and that the other is just plain wrong.

Everyone in the series is crazy and unstable but Keith. Life has wounded them all, damaged and twisted them into less than optimal ways to greet each morning. All will be buried with both friends and enemies surrounding them, those they've given to and others they've just taken from. They are sympathetically drawn for us, but their kids will like just like them, both hating and loveing their folks, wondering why they are so screwed up, and in their turn-ask these same questions that these characters did with their lives displayed for us on screen.

One generation follows another, we bury our parents and hope our children will in their turn, bury us, the world turns, the funeral home opens for business everyday but Christmas (and for enough $$ it will open even then) and there is nothing new under the sun. All things are in flux, the only constant is change, the best we can do is hobble through life leaning on those who love us, and in turn, supporting them as best we can.

It is an existentialist answer-lots of Brenda's with a bit of Nate's, a sprinkling of Claires and a heaping helping of Ruth's, with David's holding it all together.
I'm better off having seen the series, having cried deeply at places, to have remembered my own dead, but their answer(s) will not satisfy my deepest humanity's longings nor will it anyone else's, but they are the dominant answers given to us in our culture today. so how do i live in the shadow of death?",1194220800,12,8299,4.627291242362525

The ""extras"" that come with it are great - the DVD footage as well as the booklets.

The difference is palpable, and now in 2007-2008, its evident just how much this show did to change the way we view TV entirely.

It also goes without saying that the Series Finale was the single best hour of ANYTHING I have seen in either the television or motion picture world (and this comes from someone who is an avid collector of the Criterion Collection). Its hard to imagine them doing better than this on regular television anytime soon.

For its depiction of death, life, relationships, straight and gay sexuality, religion, belief and professional life, 'Six Feet Under' was unparalleled  during its five year run.

3956347,5,B002N57KGM,"One of the reviewers (pele5474) said it best when she said, ""You don't just watch the show; you invest in it emotionally."" And she's right! Several of the HBO series, including Deadwood, Carnivale, The Wire, Entourage, and the ever popular Sex in the City, become an addiction long before you realize it's happened, especially when you watch the whole season quickly. And if you're a power watcher like me, nothing validates the experience like the special features reel. Obviously, each one of the shows offers something different, and in many cases, something special, but none of them slow roasts as much emotion from the viewer as Six Feet Under. Even Sex in the City lets you off the hook emotionally by providing closure with each episode. More than most shows, SFU embraces flaws by familiarizing the audience with the single human element common to us all; limited time. And that's where SFU, which introduces each episode with the end of someone's life, is so compelling. With every episode, SFU reminds us that life is a finite gift, and in the end, the fragrance of our passions and the bold decisions born therein are etched in the memories of the people in our lives forever. It reminds us; regardless of background, we all open the doors of tomorrow hoping for the best and even though life doesn't always go as planned; that's life!

I believe this may be on of the best dramas (the best perhaps?) ever on TV.  The characters are true-to-life and gripping.  Even the things that annoy you about them (Ruth's passivity, e.g.) are believeable.

I love the way that each episode begins with a death.  Often sad (infant death from SIDS brought tears to my eyes), occasionally funny (drunk woman celebrating her 40th b.day in a limo with friends stands up and sticks her head out of the sunroof and is beaned by a low-hanging street sign), it really forces you to examine life and death issues.  I also love how each episode ends with a fade to white (hopeful?) as opposed to the traditional fade to black.

The acting is outstanding.  I think that the Nate and Brenda characters were truly wonderful.

3956384,5,B002N57KGM,"for the greatest television show of all time?

I'm going to stress to you right off the bat that for those of us who followed this show as it aired... we would have bought this set at five times the price. As I write I also find myself envying those of you who will get to experience all of it for the first time. Enough waxing nostalgic though. Let me just say get past the price (which is honestly a very good deal if you work it out), that's the last time I'll mention that.

Six Feet Under is about a family that owns a funeral home. Like all great things you can sum it up in a sentence, but the substance of it doesn't come across in less than... well in this case... about 62 hours. In the show we follow Nate, who fears death and hates funeral homes. David, who starts off as a self-hating gay man who may just want to stop being a funeral director. Claire, our rebellious young woman finishing high school. Ruth, the mother of the bunch... a highly neurotic and fickle woman... and everyone who comes in contact with the family during the course of their business.

I will say that though the show can hook you from the close of the first episode, the characters don't really feel completely fleshed out until about the fourth or fifth episode. Then again there are some shows that NEVER flesh out any characters.

You can trace the entire voyage of the show to Nate. It is about his fear of death, and the death business. It's about how he matures over the course of about six years... to me, all else is secondary. David's struggle with who he is, Claire trying to find herself, and Ruth attempting to find her place in the world now that her children are all grown up... all of those stories are brilliant as well, but they still mostly center on Nate.

This truly is the best show that has ever aired. The weakest season of it (four) is still better than everything else out there. You WILL be hooked from the first episode... and unlike so many other recent series finale's... you will not be left hanging, nor will you be disappointed.

I've not yet come across one human being who is not moved to tears at least a few times a season... and not yet met a person who hasn't sobbed at the end.

The only criticism I have is of the commentaries. Because of the plethora of directors and writers involved with the series, you will encounter a variety of commentaries from very good to very lame, however, most are just good. The commentaries on Sex and The City are far superior. However, the main point I wanted to make to folks is that many of the commentaries include spoilers for future episodes. It was a bit disappointing, having just seen an episode that left you hanging, to find out what happens while watching that same episode afterwards with commentary. The creator of the series Alan Ball is probably the worst one at giving away hints of future episodes (of course, for those who have already seen the entire series, it is not a big deal). So you might decide to hold off watching the commentaries until you have seen all episode of that particular season. I should say that many of the commentaries are very insightful and provided content and background to things folks often miss watching.",1181088000,51,1242,4.619909502262443

Up there with Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, for me, but with so many more different facets and hues, and more feeling than utter weirdness or taboo and bardo themes. I have turned more people to Six Feet Under than I can count, and all of them have been instantly hooked.

Pity you cannot see series like this one if you don't have HBO or have to spend this amount of moolah - maybe renting a season at a time is the best option. In the network world, where they make programs like Bingo, SFU would cause havoc.",1180915200,,542,4.313725490196078
3956408,5,B002N57KGM,"Hey, we all die. We die in many different ways, some quite embarrassing.

That's not the point, though.

The point is that we live. We human beings are the most unusual creatures that have ever existed. We believe in something beyond ourselves. We have hopes and dreams that reach beyond our animal selves and attempt to grasp that most illusive of all things--MEANING.

Six Feet Under is a journey. It's the journey of one family and ultimately the journey of one individual human being.

I can't imagine any human being watching this series and not being lifted up as a result. It's the best series I have personally ever seen on television, and I have been watching television a very long time. Hey, I remember Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone. There have been great shows on TV, and Six Feet Under actually follows in the line of thoughtful human dramas that Hitchcock and Serling graced us with.

3956412,4,B002N57KGM,"I recently purchased the box set after suffering through season 3 & 4 reruns (& the abysmal commercials/editing).  It was worth every penny.  The missing 1/2 star is really only due to a few things, 1 of them being several of the viewing speeches.  While they weren't bad, per se, they were usually my least favourite part of the show.

It was amazing how, watching the main characters, how the writing & acting drew you in, made you think on them long after the show ended.  I enjoyed Brenda & Billy C. the best out of them all.  Their crazy relationship, their personal & shared suffering - all of it was fantastic.

The series finale, the last several minutes, had me bawling, but I loved every minute of it.  Treat yourself with this purchase :)",1175472000,4,749,4.496296296296296
3956413,5,B002N57KGM,"This is one hefty piece of television history, and specially priced so's you won't feel cheated either.  We all know the common complaint about HBO boxed sets; they're too overpriced for what you get.  I agree, especially when you compare them to other hot boxed sets from other networks.  Here, you get them all - every single season of a great TV show - plus a couple of nifty added extras all wrapped up in a package that'll be fun explaining to others who never quite saw the show when it was running.

What can be said about ""Six Feet Under"" that hasn't been said already?  Not too much, except that it's truly one-of-a-kind.  The production values were extremely high, the cast first rate, the stories (usually) well-written and intersting, and a plot conceit that wouldn't have been touched by the broadcast networks (and even quite a few of the basic cable ones) with a two-yard stick.  Yet, at it's heart, we have the story of an American family struggling through its many real-life struggles.

People will always remember the show as ""the funeral home"" series.  Those who haven't really watched it anyway.  They're missing quite a lot.  The free spirited ""prodigal son,"" the repressed closeted gay brother, the eccentric sister, and the controlled/repressed mom are set against each other in a family business that demands repressed respect for their clients.  Cool.  With any other setting, you'd already have a potential hit.  However, it's the touchstone OF the funeral industry that makes it just a bit more than fascinating.  Particularly in the unblinking way they show the business.  Most people don't know, care, or WANT to know what happens in a funeral parlor.  Alan Ball and his merry crew show us in as unblinking detail as he shows us the foibles of the main characters just HOW we end our lives here on Earth.  Religion and spirituality aside, it's quite a ride.  Sometimes hard to look at, sometimes poignant, sometimes blackly funny, but ALWAYS with reverence and respect, the viewer gets to witness the end of life in a way that is unbearibly direct.  The strange thing is that it's also with a hint of bizarre beauty.

The extras are also eye-opening (well, except for the ""in-depth"" analysis of season 3) and show how much work went into making this phenomena of television.  It always looks easy when we watch it, but the actors (my favorites being Peter Krouse and Freddy Rodriguez), writers, directors, and producers bust their collective butts off making the show as engrossing as it is.  The soundtracks are a welcome addition, and the ""memorial book"" wraps up everything we want to know about our favorite Fischers in a way they'd want to be remembered.

'Tis worth the purchase, even if you already own one of the season sets already.  Trade it in, give it away or sell it.  Trust me, it's worth getting the whole thing over again for everything else.  All that, and a plot to put it in (complete with an turf-and-footstone topping!).",1175212800,,2971,4.785854616895874

This is a real human show and left me feeling the entire gamma of feelings:crying,laughing,anger,etc. I love the family represented in six feet under and find myself talking about them and their situations with my girlfriend as if they were real people. This show reflects life so well. If you haven't watched this yet you are in for a treat. I found that we had to ration ourselves to 2 episodes a night so it would last.

3956426,4,B002N57KGM,"I would rate the acting of the ensemble cast in Six Feet Under as one of the best ever in any TV drama Series I have seen.  The writing and directing are right up there too. However, a note of caution for those considering this set and are new to the show.  It is very intense.

It is called ""quirky"" by many viewers I have spoken to, and that would make sense considering it revolves around a family-owned funeral home and each episode begins with a death.  The show does have a real ability to ""pull the viewer into the story line,"" which is an obvious indicator that it is well written, but because of it's intensity, watching too many episodes at once ""got to me,"" and may well ""get to you"" also.

If you are looking for something light and easy going, this is not the show.  Not to say that there aren't plenty of ""laugh-out-loud"" scenes - the show has a very unique off-beat humor to it, but overall, the characters go through a lot of difficult ""stuff.""  I personally got a lot out out of it - for a TV drama, it offers an amazing amount of life-lessons and insight that makes a viewer think.

Bottom line:  this is an A+ drama, and I would highly recommend it - but not for someone looking for a light-hearted comedy.",1171843200,33,1225,4.268398268398268

I've always enjoyed the music from SFU but I don't think I ever would have bought the soundtracks; however, now that I own them, I listen to them all the time.  The special features included on many of the DVDs is also nice - I've listened to a lot of the commentaries provided by writers, directors, and actors and was fascinated by what they had to say.  Perhaps the best commentaries are provided by the series creator Alan Ball - it was interesting to listen to what he had to say about the pilot and the series finale.  The special features also include interviews with the cast, a behind the scenes look at the editing process which is very informative, and other features.  The only disappointment is that I wish there were more in-depth interviews with the cast members - all of the interviews are very brief.  There is an interview with the four Fishers and Bob Costas on one of the DVDs and I thought it would last for about an hour; however, it was a mere thirteen minutes and Bob Costas talked most of the time.

3956455,5,B002N57KGM,"""Six Feet Under"" well deserves its reputation as one of the best television series ever made. Each episode begins with the [...] This simple but brilliant formula, which introduces a slightly different cast for each story, gives each episode its distinctiveness and also provides the scope for fully exploring the members of the Fisher family and their close associates -- Ruth, Nate, David, Claire, Federico, and their various significant others. My favorite couple is David and Keith, who portray a committed gay couple with passion and tremendous sensitivity. Indeed, one of the inspiring ironies of the series resides in the fact that David and Keith turn out to be [...].

Over the spread of five seasons, the gifted writers of this series present birth, death, and various betrayals -- both violent and mundane. We watch one character graduate from high school, another adopt children, a third marry disastrously. But somehow the talent of the cast and its creators keeps the whole thing from tipping into melodrama. It's the humor, I think, that does the trick. My only criticism -- there does begin to be a certain repetitiveness as various situations cycle around for the second and third times [...]. I think this brilliant series lasts just long enough. The five seasons are a wonderfully satisfying and moving experience to watch.",1168387200,3,1342,5.1
3956456,5,B002N57KGM,"It seemed sad but fitting when HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" came to an end in 2005 after five seasons, because it was, after all, a series that forced the viewer to confront the reality that everything ends. Thus it is ironic that, this being the early twenty-first century, television series, good and bad, never die but enter an eternal afterlife of reruns in syndication and on video. If they are especially fortunate they are rewarded with the treatment ""Six Feet Under"" gets here.

Viewers who are aghast at the bowdlerized, commercial-infested version running at present on the Bravo network can take luxurious refuge in this deluxe reissue of the entire five seasons, sixty-three complete and uncut episodes, in one, surprisingly heavy (like a body, one imagines) package. They can settle down and enjoy the sharply drawn characters, the infallibly tuned dialogue and mordant humor of life at the Fisher family's funeral home. Looking at the series again one appreciates anew the uniformly brilliant acting, the attention to detail and the carefully composed visuals that make watching this series unlike any previous television experience. I do not think it is overstating the case to say that Alan Ball in this series created a world of Shakespearean scope, where the dead walk, speak, interact with, quarrel with and ultimately enlighten and comfort the still living.

The willingness to find laughter in subjects that are normally treated, if acknowledged at all, with a kind of reverent dread may offend some, notably those of the same mentality that have prohibited photographing coffins of soldiers killed in Iraq; all others will see Ball's vision for what is, an affirmation of life and joy in the face of all possible heartache and discouragement.

Seeing the episodes themselves is so satisfying that the extra features, dare one say it, seem barely necessary. Still it is good to hear Ball, the cast, and the writers speak about the show in interviews and voice-over commentary. For all fans of top notch television and drama in general, this box set is an essential item.",1168300800,17,2085,5.055232558139535

3956460,5,B002N57KGM,"To anyone who is familiar with this show you get the title. Where to begin with this HBO series? It's right on the money. Couldn't have been done any better. The actors, the writers, the directors, the content. If you love art the show is nothing but: costume design, stage design, dialogue, scenery and overall dynamic and message. Or messages. Or questions. Subtle symbolism and metaphors sprinkle each episode

This is my favorite show/movie/anything. The raw power of truth and brutal honesty caught me the first time I saw an episode a few years ago. What better way to watch and question life and death than in a funeral home? No, this show is not morbid or gothic in any sense. There are no ghosts with chains but the psychological, past and future haunt just the same.

Character Nate Fisher is the modern day hero who isn't as heroic as you'd like him to be. He has faults, he's confused, he's scared and is searching for a peace he can reconcile with and find in himself and in life, if not understand the purpose of life and the brutal truth without scented flowers to disguise its stench at times. I grew to love Nate for the character he is, faults and all.

Mother to Nate is Ruth Fisher. What a character! You love her, you pity her, you feel her depression and you struggle with her as she is widowed and searches for the light of her life without having to shield that light from a cold wind. A bit old fashioned, anything from the norm is taboo to discuss, and yet the Fisher family will catch you off balance and send you rolling on your back with laughter.

Ruth's only daughter and youngest child is Clare Fisher. Clare is a character who grows not necessarily the most but matures more than any from the beginning of this show to the end. We see her as a high school outcast driving an avocado green hearse inherited from her deceased father who is struggling to find her niche in the Fisher family and life in general. Discovering herself as an artist is what sets in motion her many disastrous relationships, from Russel to Billy and countless others. Her cynical bitterness makes one want to shake her repeatedly, and yet you agree with much of what she has to say.

David Fisher, Nate's younger brother, is homosexual and is for the beginning at least dealing with the acceptance of his family, society and most importantly himself. He is the driving force of the family business. While David is uptight and pompous at times he has a few rendezvous and breakdowns that change him towards the end of the show.

There are so many more characters to discus, such as Lisa, Miah, George, Brenda, Billy, Keith, Brenda and Billy's Mom, Ruth's Sister and Kleptomaniac Friend, those who die and those who change lives.

I never thought I would own these DVD's in its entirety as they are expensive. But Amazon had a killer deal on the complete box set I could not pass up. Since purchasing this item I have watched this show from beginning to end, almost. I will watch the last episode tonight, and I assure you since I have seen it before there will be tears for ones lost and those who must trudge on.

The ending episode ties the characters all together despite the loss of one. There are some questions regarding what happens to the characters that are answered by the end of the show as we see glimpses of the lives each character will lead after we leave them on the screen. We see how the die, what or who they leave behind in their range of ages, and we do so without words or dialogue as there is no need but to an amazing soundtrack fed perfectly into the episode. We feel complete and yet emotionally saddened to know that in the end we all will rest Six Feet Under. The closing shot is a close up of Clare, with youth, life and beauty in her eyes. All that will be and could be: the unknown destiny of what is to come. Pan out to the road before us, the path in which we choose to make life beautiful or else fall victim to it. Why must there be death? As Nate has said, ""To make life more beautiful.""",1168300800,,4030,4.414535666218035

3956462,5,B002N57KGM,"for five years, HBO's ""Six Feet Under"" has mezmorized and captured viewers across the globe. combining dark comedy, haunting drama, and poignent moments, this gem of a show leaves a lasting impression and who would have thought it be about dead people? the Fisher family is the average family who just happens to run a local funeral home. when the patriarch of the family, Mr. Fisher, suddenly dies the two brothers, outlandish Nate and closet homosexual David are now left with running the funeral home. also apart of the Fisher clan, mother Ruth who so desperatly wants to shrug of her husbands death and daughter Claire, a free lancing teen who just wants to rebel. the show really played out less like a show and more like an actual documentary, the plot may seem a bit extreme but it conveys it in such a real way its almost to believable. my one complaint about the show is that they made Ruth such a b**** in the fifth season. now, HBO has released this special gift set version, which i have to say is a great money saver. instead of buying all five seasons seperatle and having to pay a lot more, this one hacks the price off by nearly a hundred. so overall, great show and great box set, a must for all SFU fans.",1167955200,,1222,4.435555555555555
3956463,2,B002N57KGM,"The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a clich&eacute; cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.

BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.

PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win!",1167782400,35,2076,4.669398907103825

3956495,5,B002N57KGM,"I had no idea what to expect when I purchased this Six feet Under box set. I heard from many friends that this was one great show I had to check out. I never had any interest of watching this show when it was on HBO. I wish I would have given it a chance when it was still on the air. I just completed watching all five seasons and it took me a little over a month to do it. The first few episodes made me wonder if this show was even worth getting, but after the first 2 episodes I was hooked. The show is about the Fisher family who own a funeral home. Every episode starts out with a death and sets the tone for that show. I have seen many TV shows, but no other show has dealt with life and how we deal with it like this show does. The characters on Six Feet Under are not all just white folks. The show has a great balance of ethnicity and diversity. You get characters who are gay, latino, black, and many others(some with major issues). This show has some of the best acting I have ever seen. If you're like me you're probably thinking a show about a family that owns a funeral home? This show is so much more than that. I like the fact that this show takes you on a journey with the characters, and as each season passes the show just gives you more twists and turns. The very last episode of this series is one of the best hours and most emotional hours of TV I have ever watched. After you see the last episode you will know that life is a gift and appreciate it more than ever. I highly recommend this truly unique and amazing show!

3956499,5,B002N57KGM,"We just finished watching the entire series.  The entire series was fantastic, but the final episode was the best hour of tv or any type of cinema that I've ever watched.  The character development is so good, that you really feel like you know the characters.  The show does a great job of showing you all sides of the characters, their flaws, their challenges, etc...  The acting is superb.  Basically, this is the best drama series you will ever see, and it is possible that no other series will ever top it.",1165536000,4,511,4.510869565217392
3956500,5,B002N57KGM,"Finally finished watching the entire run of the show. I saw about the first 3 seasons when it aired, but not beyond that. I pretty much knew where it was going to go, in terms of big climax, cos it was just so well written and so unconventional in its ace writing style that it couldn't NOT go there. I won't spoil it, but as it's a show about death you have to know from the beginning that sooner or later you are going to experience a major character death. And yet it's so much more than that. Some of the details for how the characters and plot arrived were superfluous, silly or just flat out of character at times. But for the most part the writing was tight, the characters dreams to develop, the plot dead-on (no pun). I have never seen anything on television deal with death as frankly as this show. It managed to show you death every week and never once desensitize the viewer to blood, mortality, grief, or the contemplation of ""what next?"" I'm thrilled for this series' lifespan and mourn its passing.",1165363200,4,1013,4.3936170212765955
3956501,5,B002N57KGM,"You absolutely cannot go wrong with this gift set. Unfortunately, I have already purchased each season individually (and for a pretty penny, too!) so I can't justify buying this one, even though I love the packaging. Having never seen an episode of the show, I read the premise and bought the first season. After a few episodes, I was already ordering the remaining seasons and finished watching the entire series in just a few weeks! Hilarious at times, realistic, and insightful. Watching the series finale was tough, after growing so attached to the Fischer family and their cohorts. Like I said, this set is absolutely worth it. The writing is fantastic and I can guarantee that it will not disappoint. I must warn though: I am usually not a huge advocate for the rating systems, but this show is definitely not for the kiddos. Just keep that in mind and you'll be fine.",1164844800,7,874,4.718954248366013
3956502,4,B002N57KGM,"Obviously, this is a great show.  I didn't buy the DVDs until now because of HBO's insane pricing, so I was happy when this came out (and in such a neat box, too).  The only problem I have with it is that the individual seasons and ""In Memoriam"" booklet are wedged inside very tightly.  It's really difficult to pull a season out, so I've had to take the ""In Memoriam"" booklet out of the box for more ease.  Not a huge problem, but one that grows increasingly annoying.  Still, definitely a great box set.",1164153600,11,505,4.329787234042553
3956503,5,B002N57KGM,"It is essentially impossible to write an appropriate review for this engaging, amazing, wicked, dark, and realistic series that graced the television landscape for the first half of the new millinimum.  Considered by many critics and fans alike as ""the best television series to grace the small screen,"" SIX FEET UNDER was the prenimulate HBO series: it featureted everything that the HBO names expects (sex, drugs, violence, and rock'n'roll) but adds a fresh almost family-friendly twist to the proceedings.

The series focuses on the lives of the Fisher family after everything they've ever known is turned upside down with the patriarch of the family dies suddenly in a car crash on Christmas Eve; with the majority of the first season summarizing the families attempt to ""move-on with their lives, and learn that life goes on, forever, until it ends.""  With their fathers death in the pilot, the two oldest children Nate (the rebel, who always ran away from his responsibility) and David (the closeted `good son') take over the family business as their much-younger sister finished her high school years and their mother learns how to continue her life without her husband of 35 years.

Throughout five seasons the series focused on this ecletic mix of quirky characters, and the people that come in-and-out of their lives.  And this is where the heart of the series can be found - it is always realistic and while the stories seem far-fetched they are quit the opposite: everything presented in this series is a normal part of the human exsistance, and for the first time SIX FEET UNDER (as a television series) captures the monotomy of human esistance into a seemingly perfect television show.

HBO has included all 63 episodes of the series (including the emotion series finale (which I personally consider the single best of hour television I have ever watched) in this one elaborate collection (also including a large booklet that gives the history of the series and a character map, as well as the two previously-released soundtrack CDs).",1163808000,205,2048,5.0265486725663715

8374683,5,B002N57KGM,"I've seen the entire series twice. Once, years ago, before my father passed away, and then again, recently with my boyfriend. My bf had been skeptical and frustrated with the show, how practically everyone on the show cheats, but the final season got him. And me again. The final episode absolutely slayed me. When Claire sees Nate fade away in her rear view mirror as she drives away... it floored me. The feeling of having to move on and continue to live life after losing someone so close to you, leaving them behind. I feel like that shot nailed the feeling. I sobbed through the rest of the episode, through the Sia song ... and so did my boyfriend! I continued to cry like a baby after it ended. Something about that show... human nature and our flaws, our demons, our fears and then realizing that, despite resentment and getting hurt, what ultimately matters is that everyone you love will be gone one day. It haunts me and yet it's so healing and therapeutic. It's profound. Absolutely my favorite tv series.....",1520812800,,1021,4.6464088397790055

8374685,2,B002N57KGM,"Seasons 1-2 get a full 5 stars. They're sad, funny, and clever.
Season 3 gets a -5 stars, the ""Lisa Season."" The ""Joe Lies, Joe Lies, When He Cries"" actress from Say Anything. REALLY, no one cares about this character.
Seasons 4-5 get a 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with timeless George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? (Keith owns an armored car and is making a delivery to the First Back of India? Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so we assume he didn't close the business and move out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind?) So the big love story is just a bust after all?

Our group does applaud the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though...hahahahhah...Everyone in the group was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever, huh?

If you HAVE to watch this series, my advice is to watch the first 2 seasons, enjoy them while they were good and move onto something else. Season 3 was a total throw away (NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE LISA CHARACTER) and 4-5 are just plain slow and depressing. And the abrupt unoriginal lazy ending is an insult, both to the characters and the viewer.",1518998400,,2508,4.725400457665904
