3025951,5,B000YDBP52,"Family Feud is a classic show that ran for an impressive nine years with the always dashing Richard Dawson as host. Though Feud has been revived a few times over the years, the new incarnations haven't come close to matching the original's popularity.

This DVD set includes some of the most memorable celebrity episodes of the game, most of which aired in primetime. It's a chance to see the reunited casts of classic shows like The Brady Bunch, Petticoat Junction, Gilligan's Island, Leave It to Beaver and others competing for charity. Other show casts taking part include WKRP in Cincinnati, The Love Boat, Eight is Enough, General Hospital, What's Happening!, Family, Dallas, Soap, Benson, The Jeffersons, and Welcome Back Kotter.

Prior to this release, you could only see the episodes if you were lucky enough to catch them on GSN. If you love classic TV shows and stars, you'll surely enjoy these episodes.

* Note: Though the box mentions the casts of Batman and Lost in Space, they aren't in this set. Only one episode from that particular special week of shows is included and features the casts of Hawaiian Eye and Gilligan's Island. It's still a great set but don't buy it looking for Batman and Lost in Space!",1195084800,26,1223,4.814285714285714

3025978,4,B000YDBP52,"It is so hard to believe that the original great of Family Feud, Richard Dawson has died after battling cancer of the esophagus. He really was a quick-witted game show host, whom really was the George Clooney of his era in the 60's and 70's. His game show era was remarkable, and he knew how to make people laugh, cry, and have a great sense of humor. Family Feud was a great game show during the 70's and 80's, under Dawson's era. But his works with celebrities were really where the stars came out to play, from Susan Lucci to Dick Van Patten from Eight Is Enough, all the way Mark Goodson himself and Richard Simmons. But with of the shows Richard Dawson had done, only the celebrity shows have came down video, and a lot of them are right here.

Best Of All Star Family Feud, which came out in 2008, showcases Family Feud during the 70's and 80's, during Richard Dawson's first era of the show, when celebrities came out to play for charity in the funniest ways from Betty White, to Florence Henderson and The Brady Bunch, all playing for charities of their choices, and a bit of family frolic. The shows are remastered well, while in each show, Richard Dawson put on his most elegant in tuxedo and all, as each celebrity out their best and the brightest, by matching their answers with the surveys. Looking back at these shows, they are still definitely as fun to watch today, as they were back in the days that they were first aired. You are sometimes quickly reminded of what made a great game show host deliver. Richard Dawson did learn from the best, as he was at one point as panelist on Match Game with Gene Rayburn.

Richard Dawson wore many hats in his career, from playing Newkirk on Hogan's Heroes, to being a talk show sidekick in the United Kingdom on Mike Stogey's talk show, to being the deviant game show host in the movie The Running Man. But the one hat everyone thinks of with Richard the most was the one he wore as the host of Family Feud. Since that era, every emcee that has done Family Feud from the late Ray Combs whom tragically committed suicide in 1996 to the latest host Steve Harvey has tried to make Family Feud his own. But no one has replicated what Richard Dawson did for the show. Survey says, Richard Dawson, you'll be missed, and that is the #1 answer.

3025979,4,B000YDBP52,"I bought this DVD when it was on sale for less than nine dollars.  I've noticed that the price goes up and down quite a bit.  For the price I paid, it was certainly a bargain.  I like Richard Dawson but don't consider him to be the greatest game show host.  However, for Family Feud he was a perfect fit.  The real joy of these videos are being able to see stars come together from some of my favorite shows of those decades.  From Petticoat Junction to The Brady Bunch, Soap, and Gilligan's Island and many more, it was great to see some of the stars that are no longer with us. One thing that surprised me--when I saw Frank Cady (Sam Drucker) of Petticoat Junction in these episodes, it motivated me to Google him to see when he passed away.  It turns out that Frank Cady is still alive, 96 years old and living in California.  It's amazing that many of the stars that you thought of as being so old back then are still alive.  This included the guy who played Homer Bedlow on that show who only passed away in the past year or two.  But I digress.  If you grew up watching the shows that are featured on this collection, you will enjoy it immensely as did I.  I lopped off one star for the box listing shows that were actually not featured in the set.  Other than that, have fun.",1338076800,3,1282,4.183673469387755
3025980,5,B000YDBP52,"I love these just as much now as I did back when I watched them when the first aired.  In fact, I probably like them even more now because of the nostalgia factor.  Even if you're watching a feud with participants from a show that you don't remember, it's still the Feud with Richard Dawson.

The shows typically don't get past the 'Double' round because they take so much time at the beginning promo-ing the casts.  And they don't have Batman or Lost in Space, so bad vibes to the people who made the packaging.  In fact, it would have been nice if they listed the shows that are on the four DVDs on the box.

As far as the production quality of the DVD, it's more noticeable because the DVD menus are so crisp and sharp.  But this is a TV show from the 70's and early 80's, so you can't expect it to be that good.  The first Terminator movie had worse production quality than this.  I've heard that you can convert film to High Definition, but this was probably originally tape instead of film, which is cheaper (hence why The Terminator movie used it).  Regardless, even though I'm watching it on my 50"" plasma TV, there are very few times that I even notice the quality once I initially get past the jolt at the beginning going from the menu to the show.

Anyway, it's 720 minutes of entertainment for less than $15.  If they had a 'best of' section or a blooper section included, it would be incredible, but it's super the way it is.  After you get this, you would probably enjoy the excellent Family Feud game for the iPod, as well.  In fact, that's why I bought these DVDs, to show my daughter that one of her favorite iPod games was originally a TV show.",1337212800,,1662,4.302250803858521
3025981,5,B000YDBP52,"I highly enjoyed this dvd collection of Family Feud episodes. It was fun seeing big stars of that time on this show!

I have enjoyed sitting back, remembering back in the day when ""good"" programs were on tv. My mother-in-law has also enjoyed watching this with me.  I just wish more episodes of Family Feud will be available in the future.",1308355200,2,338,4.349206349206349
3025985,5,B000YDBP52,"I bought this set and I love it! Excellent picture and sound quality here.
 (Remember: it's 1980s full screen TV!)

Generally, each of these one-hour prime time specials is divided on episode menus thusly: Team 1 vs. Team 2 is one selection. Team 3 vs. Team 4 from the same hour is selection two. The winners of these two matches play a one-question game for the grand prize on selection three.

Twice there are only two days of a five daytime show battle between the same pair of teams and one time, there's three days. A Disc Four anomaly has a contest between Gilligan's Island and Hawaiian Eye. This is supposed to be followed by two matches with Batman. Perhaps some legal issue prevented BCI from using Batman and these segments were deleted AFTER box contents had been printed up.

It's speculative, OK?

If you liked Richard Dawson's FAMILY FEUD, you too will enjoy this collection!

3025989,4,B000YDBP52,"It was truly a disappointing day, as I just received the second volume of Family Feud to find it's essentially the same DVD set I already had that was released in 2008. Both versions have, as far as I can tell so far, many of the same episodes or Richard being Richard and seducing the ladies...all the ladies, even grandma. So here I was excited for 43 episodes I haven't seen and here I am now typing a review since there were no reviews on Amazon when I purchased to warn me about this tragedy. I am now left wondering if there will ever be more episodes of Family Feud in the vault that will be released on DVD so that I can watch Richard Dawson with his pinky finger  extended with a giant ring on it as he mingles with the beautiful lady contestants while brushing off the fact that most of them are married, often while their husband is standing right there. I haven't watched through all the episodes, but so far...the first disc has the same episodes as the first Family Feud All Stars DVD set, but I have found at least a few on disc 2 that are new, including this particularly questionable episode where Richard and this 19 year old blonde girl are talking about how they met when she was a young girl and Richard offered her candy. Seriously, it's weird, you should see it, they keep going back to how Richard offered her candy, kind of creepy, even for Richard. Anyway, they pulled a fast one on us fans by giving this DVD set a slightly different picture on the cover and now adding the words, ""The Best of..."" to the title. I've been had by them, very tricky...I suppose I'm a sucker who didn't know they were essentially selling the same product in a different looking case. HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST VOLUME, BUY THIS BECAUSE IT'S GREAT. Or, if you're a fan of the show, there are a few new ones on here the first volume didn't have, and as I watch through more, I'm really hoping to find more episodes I haven't seen.",1265155200,24,1947,4.3342465753424655
3025990,5,B000YDBP52,"This wasn't my typical DVD movie or TV show purchase.  This occasion was reserved for good old family fun.  My teenage children didn't grow up watching the original airing starring the one and only Richard Dawson on ABC TV and have only caught a few glimpses of this show while channel surfing though today's vast TV Wasteland.  What made this purchase special was how it made the family gather around the television and participate with the program.  Before we knew it, we had knocked down several episodes and the laughs kept coming.  The kids loved it and it made what may have been just another evening more memorable.  Like other reviews have stated, some of the program content mentioned on the box wasn't included on the DVD's and some of the programs had lower quality video than others but what would you expect for a game show this age?  I'm sure they didn't record the episodes with DVD's in mind all these decades later.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are in the mood for laughs or to spice up a family party or a get together with friends.  The laughs we shared couldn't be measured in dollars spent (which by the way wasn't much) and we look forward to the possibility of future volumes.",1265155200,2,1206,4.546296296296297

3025993,4,B000YDBP52,"This set is a decent walk down memory lane with stars from the 1950s -1970s.  Boomers will easily recognize the TV casts of Petticoat Junction (with two Billie Jo Bradleys), Leave It To Beaver (sans Tony Dow), Welcome Back Kotter (Horshak is the ONLY Sweathog present), & Hawiian Eye (sans Robert Conrad).  For some of the older viewers, stars from Your Hit Parade are on hand too. There is a playoff between heroic figures (represented by stars like Adam West) Vs villians.  Unfortunatley, West is the only Batman celeb here.  If you are a Gen X or Gen Y viewer, you won't rekindle memories here.  Most shows were taped from 1979-1983. There are no Doogie Housers, Small Wonders, or Highlanders to be found- sorry.  Nonetheless, it is a relaxing way to see some celebs, like West and Ken Osmond (Eddie Haskel) out of character and playing for charity.  Some of these actors could have used the money themselves, as their fame predated the chunky royalties most TV actors get today.

3025994,5,B000YDBP52,"I remember watching the All-Star Family Feud specials in the '70s and '80s. They were always a treat for me. I remember hurrying to get my homework done, eat dinner, etc before they would come on ABC. It was a classic time.

When I discovered these specials were available on DVD, in one package, I was elated! How I wanted to see these episodes of ""Family Feud"" again. On occasion, I had seen a few of them over on Game Show Network, but it wasn't very often. Now, I own all of them, or certainly a nice collection. There are other episodes not included in this package, which I would also love to see again. I am hoping a second DVD set will be released in the future. I would buy it in a second!

A previous reviewer mentioned how interviews with celebrities who appeared, like Joyce Dewitt, Marla Gibbs, Dick Van Patten, and Meredith Baxter-Birney would have most definitely been an added bonus. I could not agree more. I am sure they have memories they would have gladly shared. Another reviewer noticed how often the cast of ""Eight Is Enough"" was on. True, they were on a lot. The entire cast, with the exception of Betty Buckley, made an appearance. I recently discovered they often played in memory of Diana Hyland, the Mom from the first season.

My sister, who was born during the original run of ""Feud"", enjoyed watching these shows with me more than I thought she would. For me, it was a trip back in time. Whether you grew up during those days or not, if you know the shows, you will like this. Now, I will admit if you are a stranger to these shows (Soap, Love Boat, The Jeffersons, It's A Living, Three's Company, etc...) you might not find this all that great. However, if you remember them, you will see a lot of familiar faces. It is one of the best collections I have ever seen, and I am so glad to own it.

I would like to point out that these episodes are not edited-they have just taken each individual celebrity segment out of each episode and presented it by itself on the menus. It's a really odd way to do it, but the episodes themselves are all there. I'd recommend picking this up-it's a good deal for the price, and hopefully they'll keep putting out more game show DVDs.",1203120000,,773,4.48936170212766
3026012,4,B000YDBP52,"...still nice to have some of the classic Dawson episodes all the same.

As noted in other reviews, video quality in some of the episodes is a bit on the shaky side (mildly annoying), but overall most of the shows are of above average quality.

My big disappointment is that with the exception of a photo gallery on disc 4, there aren't any extras on this at all.  No interviews, rare footage or lost episodes.  One of the things that made the MG set great were all of those extra goodies that enhanced the episodes.  Nothing like that here.  Plus, I think there are just one too may episodes with the cast of 8 Is Enough.  That was never my favorite show growing up, but that's my hang up.

There is a comment posted to an earlier review here that says that some of the episodes were edited down to 10 minutes.  Don't believe that!  Many of the shows in this set were hour long broadcasts, and these 10 minute segements were nothing more than the final showdown between the 2 winning teams from the previous matches in the games from the same show that proceed it in the set.  All of the shows presented in this set are complete and intact!

All in all, it's good to have these shows available, although I would have welcomed just regular FF episodes with actual families as much as I would the celeb shows.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with the TPIR set in March.",1201132800,3,1380,4.34375

Then, the interior case is confusing and I still don't know how to get to the second and fourth discs.

Unlike the far superior Best of the Match Game sets that came out this year, it just seems no extra effort was put in here. The video quality is pretty bad and jittery in some episodes as well.

One thing I WILL say for this set, though, is I do love having all of these classic episodes collected in one place. I just wish the presentation had been a bit better and that there had at least been an effort to avoid the jittery picture.",1199836800,8,715,3.9583333333333335
3026017,4,B000YDBP52,"There have been so many game shows that have been definitive. While the shows itself have shown new life, the hosts on the other hand, have not delivered the originality we often loved before. There is no other game show that has stated that point like Family Feud. No matter who has hosted the show whether it was the late Ray Combs, Louie Anderson, Richard Karn from Home Improvement, or the latest host John O' Hurley, we will always think of the original master of the feud, Richard Dawson. During his original 9 year run from 1976-1985, Family Feud really delivered as one of the definitive game shows of all time in syndication and on ABC. The show has also appealed well from its constant airing on GSN, and now there are feuds that are returning to the light for the first time in years, which are now on home video for the first time ever.

All-Star Family Feud is a 4 disc DVD set showcasing your favorite celebrities playing your favorite game show with surveys. The collection primarily focuses in on special primetime episodes from Richard's ABC edition from the 70's and 80's which include your favorite stars from shows like Soap, Loni Anderson from WKRP In Cincinatti, Susan Lucci from All My Children, and the cast of The Brady Bunch. The DVD also includes some episodes from the syndicated edition including the 1985 Hollywood Walk Of Fame week, which also features the feud creator, the late great Mark Goodson, as well as actress and T.V. pioneer Betty White and Ceasear Romero. The shows are refreshing to watch, some of them also have never been aired on GSN before, and bring in a great appeal to those who've loved Dawson's days when he used to say survey said.

While we've seen game shows recently that came to DVD as board games like Jeopardy and The Price Is Right, the actual episodes are much more fun to watch. Family Feud has had many DVD game editions, but this DVD set is definitely the best. I loved watching these great shows for the first time, and if you are a fan of classic game shows, you'll absolutely love All-Star Family Feud as a part of your DVD collection.

3260448,5,B000YDBP52,"Family Feud is a classic show that ran for an impressive nine years with the always dashing Richard Dawson as host. Though Feud has been revived a few times over the years, the new incarnations haven't come close to matching the original's popularity.

This DVD set includes some of the most memorable celebrity episodes of the game, most of which aired in primetime. It's a chance to see the reunited casts of classic shows like The Brady Bunch, Petticoat Junction, Gilligan's Island, Leave It to Beaver and others competing for charity. Other show casts taking part include WKRP in Cincinnati, The Love Boat, Eight is Enough, General Hospital, What's Happening!, Family, Dallas, Soap, Benson, The Jeffersons, and Welcome Back Kotter.

Prior to this release, you could only see the episodes if you were lucky enough to catch them on GSN. If you love classic TV shows and stars, you'll surely enjoy these episodes.

3260475,4,B000YDBP52,"It is so hard to believe that the original great of Family Feud, Richard Dawson has died after battling cancer of the esophagus. He really was a quick-witted game show host, whom really was the George Clooney of his era in the 60's and 70's. His game show era was remarkable, and he knew how to make people laugh, cry, and have a great sense of humor. Family Feud was a great game show during the 70's and 80's, under Dawson's era. But his works with celebrities were really where the stars came out to play, from Susan Lucci to Dick Van Patten from Eight Is Enough, all the way Mark Goodson himself and Richard Simmons. But with of the shows Richard Dawson had done, only the celebrity shows have came down video, and a lot of them are right here.

Best Of All Star Family Feud, which came out in 2008, showcases Family Feud during the 70's and 80's, during Richard Dawson's first era of the show, when celebrities came out to play for charity in the funniest ways from Betty White, to Florence Henderson and The Brady Bunch, all playing for charities of their choices, and a bit of family frolic. The shows are remastered well, while in each show, Richard Dawson put on his most elegant in tuxedo and all, as each celebrity out their best and the brightest, by matching their answers with the surveys. Looking back at these shows, they are still definitely as fun to watch today, as they were back in the days that they were first aired. You are sometimes quickly reminded of what made a great game show host deliver. Richard Dawson did learn from the best, as he was at one point as panelist on Match Game with Gene Rayburn.

Richard Dawson wore many hats in his career, from playing Newkirk on Hogan's Heroes, to being a talk show sidekick in the United Kingdom on Mike Stogey's talk show, to being the deviant game show host in the movie The Running Man. But the one hat everyone thinks of with Richard the most was the one he wore as the host of Family Feud. Since that era, every emcee that has done Family Feud from the late Ray Combs whom tragically committed suicide in 1996 to the latest host Steve Harvey has tried to make Family Feud his own. But no one has replicated what Richard Dawson did for the show. Survey says, Richard Dawson, you'll be missed, and that is the #1 answer.

3260476,4,B000YDBP52,"I bought this DVD when it was on sale for less than nine dollars.  I've noticed that the price goes up and down quite a bit.  For the price I paid, it was certainly a bargain.  I like Richard Dawson but don't consider him to be the greatest game show host.  However, for Family Feud he was a perfect fit.  The real joy of these videos are being able to see stars come together from some of my favorite shows of those decades.  From Petticoat Junction to The Brady Bunch, Soap, and Gilligan's Island and many more, it was great to see some of the stars that are no longer with us. One thing that surprised me--when I saw Frank Cady (Sam Drucker) of Petticoat Junction in these episodes, it motivated me to Google him to see when he passed away.  It turns out that Frank Cady is still alive, 96 years old and living in California.  It's amazing that many of the stars that you thought of as being so old back then are still alive.  This included the guy who played Homer Bedlow on that show who only passed away in the past year or two.  But I digress.  If you grew up watching the shows that are featured on this collection, you will enjoy it immensely as did I.  I lopped off one star for the box listing shows that were actually not featured in the set.  Other than that, have fun.",1338076800,3,1282,4.183673469387755
3260477,5,B000YDBP52,"I love these just as much now as I did back when I watched them when the first aired.  In fact, I probably like them even more now because of the nostalgia factor.  Even if you're watching a feud with participants from a show that you don't remember, it's still the Feud with Richard Dawson.

The shows typically don't get past the 'Double' round because they take so much time at the beginning promo-ing the casts.  And they don't have Batman or Lost in Space, so bad vibes to the people who made the packaging.  In fact, it would have been nice if they listed the shows that are on the four DVDs on the box.

As far as the production quality of the DVD, it's more noticeable because the DVD menus are so crisp and sharp.  But this is a TV show from the 70's and early 80's, so you can't expect it to be that good.  The first Terminator movie had worse production quality than this.  I've heard that you can convert film to High Definition, but this was probably originally tape instead of film, which is cheaper (hence why The Terminator movie used it).  Regardless, even though I'm watching it on my 50"" plasma TV, there are very few times that I even notice the quality once I initially get past the jolt at the beginning going from the menu to the show.

Anyway, it's 720 minutes of entertainment for less than $15.  If they had a 'best of' section or a blooper section included, it would be incredible, but it's super the way it is.  After you get this, you would probably enjoy the excellent Family Feud game for the iPod, as well.  In fact, that's why I bought these DVDs, to show my daughter that one of her favorite iPod games was originally a TV show.",1337212800,,1662,4.302250803858521

 (Remember: it's 1980s full screen TV!)

Generally, each of these one-hour prime time specials is divided on episode menus thusly: Team 1 vs. Team 2 is one selection. Team 3 vs. Team 4 from the same hour is selection two. The winners of these two matches play a one-question game for the grand prize on selection three.

Twice there are only two days of a five daytime show battle between the same pair of teams and one time, there's three days. A Disc Four anomaly has a contest between Gilligan's Island and Hawaiian Eye. This is supposed to be followed by two matches with Batman. Perhaps some legal issue prevented BCI from using Batman and these segments were deleted AFTER box contents had been printed up.

3260486,4,B000YDBP52,"It was truly a disappointing day, as I just received the second volume of Family Feud to find it's essentially the same DVD set I already had that was released in 2008. Both versions have, as far as I can tell so far, many of the same episodes or Richard being Richard and seducing the ladies...all the ladies, even grandma. So here I was excited for 43 episodes I haven't seen and here I am now typing a review since there were no reviews on Amazon when I purchased to warn me about this tragedy. I am now left wondering if there will ever be more episodes of Family Feud in the vault that will be released on DVD so that I can watch Richard Dawson with his pinky finger  extended with a giant ring on it as he mingles with the beautiful lady contestants while brushing off the fact that most of them are married, often while their husband is standing right there. I haven't watched through all the episodes, but so far...the first disc has the same episodes as the first Family Feud All Stars DVD set, but I have found at least a few on disc 2 that are new, including this particularly questionable episode where Richard and this 19 year old blonde girl are talking about how they met when she was a young girl and Richard offered her candy. Seriously, it's weird, you should see it, they keep going back to how Richard offered her candy, kind of creepy, even for Richard. Anyway, they pulled a fast one on us fans by giving this DVD set a slightly different picture on the cover and now adding the words, ""The Best of..."" to the title. I've been had by them, very tricky...I suppose I'm a sucker who didn't know they were essentially selling the same product in a different looking case. HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST VOLUME, BUY THIS BECAUSE IT'S GREAT. Or, if you're a fan of the show, there are a few new ones on here the first volume didn't have, and as I watch through more, I'm really hoping to find more episodes I haven't seen.",1265155200,24,1947,4.3342465753424655

My teenage children didn't grow up watching the original airing starring the one and only Richard Dawson on ABC TV and have only caught a few glimpses of this show while channel surfing though today's vast TV Wasteland.  What made this purchase special was how it made the family gather around the television and participate with the program.  Before we knew it, we had knocked down several episodes and the laughs kept coming.  The kids loved it and it made what may have been just another evening more memorable.  Like other reviews have stated, some of the program content mentioned on the box wasn't included on the DVD's and some of the programs had lower quality video than others but what would you expect for a game show this age?  I'm sure they didn't record the episodes with DVD's in mind all these decades later.

For some of the older viewers, stars from Your Hit Parade are on hand too. There is a playoff between heroic figures (represented by stars like Adam West) Vs villians.  Unfortunatley, West is the only Batman celeb here.  If you are a Gen X or Gen Y viewer, you won't rekindle memories here.  Most shows were taped from 1979-1983. There are no Doogie Housers, Small Wonders, or Highlanders to be found- sorry.  Nonetheless, it is a relaxing way to see some celebs, like West and Ken Osmond (Eddie Haskel) out of character and playing for charity.

There are other episodes not included in this package, which I would also love to see again. I am hoping a second DVD set will be released in the future. I would buy it in a second!

A previous reviewer mentioned how interviews with celebrities who appeared, like Joyce Dewitt, Marla Gibbs, Dick Van Patten, and Meredith Baxter-Birney would have most definitely been an added bonus. I could not agree more. I am sure they have memories they would have gladly shared. Another reviewer noticed how often the cast of ""Eight Is Enough"" was on. True, they were on a lot. The entire cast, with the exception of Betty Buckley, made an appearance. I recently discovered they often played in memory of Diana Hyland, the Mom from the first season.

My sister, who was born during the original run of ""Feud"", enjoyed watching these shows with me more than I thought she would. For me, it was a trip back in time. Whether you grew up during those days or not, if you know the shows, you will like this. Now, I will admit if you are a stranger to these shows (Soap, Love Boat, The Jeffersons, It's A Living, Three's Company, etc...) you might not find this all that great. However, if you remember them, you will see a lot of familiar faces. It is one of the best collections I have ever seen, and I am so glad to own it.

They also need to release a daytime TV set. This was when the soap stars would come on, and play for charity too.",1244764800,,1940,4.321428571428571

No Batman/Lost in Space episode, eventhough it mentions it on the box, therefore no Vincent Price!

Some episodes have a poor picture quality.

Love the show, but not this collection!

How can we get the correct version, if there is one?",1204675200,,247,4.809523809523809
3260507,2,B000YDBP52,"Don't get me wrong. I think that the family feud is a great show, but something is not right with this set. From the start, I noticed that the video quality is poor. It looks like the old vhs tapes recorded in the worst mode. The color is very dull and it looks much worse than anything on the game show network. Also, the movements of the people are sometimes strange; like there is a very slight but noticeable miss or lag in the tapes. I really could not enjoy watching this because of these problems. It seems that the manufacturer or producer of this set cut costs and we have another cheaply done dvd set. If your just interested in the content, then buy this set. But if you've seen these episodes for years, (how they're supposed to look), then maybe you should reconsider purchasing this set.",1203638400,2,801,4.418918918918919
3260508,5,B000YDBP52,"If you're a fan of classic game shows or classic TV, this set is well worth the twenty bucks. Unlike the Match Game set, these are not episodes that you can just see on Game Show Network any day of the week. The video/audio quality is fine, with the exception of one segment-they probably should have called this one a ""bonus feature"" or put a notice before it, but it's not unwatchable or anything.
I would like to point out that these episodes are not edited-they have just taken each individual celebrity segment out of each episode and presented it by itself on the menus. It's a really odd way to do it, but the episodes themselves are all there. I'd recommend picking this up-it's a good deal for the price, and hopefully they'll keep putting out more game show DVDs.",1203120000,,773,4.48936170212766
3260509,4,B000YDBP52,"...still nice to have some of the classic Dawson episodes all the same.

As noted in other reviews, video quality in some of the episodes is a bit on the shaky side (mildly annoying), but overall most of the shows are of above average quality.

My big disappointment is that with the exception of a photo gallery on disc 4, there aren't any extras on this at all.  No interviews, rare footage or lost episodes.  One of the things that made the MG set great were all of those extra goodies that enhanced the episodes.  Nothing like that here.  Plus, I think there are just one too may episodes with the cast of 8 Is Enough.  That was never my favorite show growing up, but that's my hang up.

There is a comment posted to an earlier review here that says that some of the episodes were edited down to 10 minutes.  Don't believe that!  Many of the shows in this set were hour long broadcasts, and these 10 minute segements were nothing more than the final showdown between the 2 winning teams from the previous matches in the games from the same show that proceed it in the set.  All of the shows presented in this set are complete and intact!

All in all, it's good to have these shows available, although I would have welcomed just regular FF episodes with actual families as much as I would the celeb shows.  I'm looking forward to seeing what they do with the TPIR set in March.",1201132800,3,1380,4.34375

3260511,3,B000YDBP52,"This is a game show fanatics Dream come true. One of the classic Game shows is on DVD with one of the best hosts.

3260512,5,B000YDBP52,"It's this one...FF has been a staple of American culture for over 30 years now, but it was the Richard Dawson era which truly made that happen and is represented here. This set features a number of specials from both the daytime (TV's All-Time Favorites, Adventure Stars) and nighttime shows (Walk of Fame), but of particular interest are the hour-long All-Star Specials which aired on ABC primetime from 78-84, featuring some of the era's top shows (Three's Company, Love Boat, WKRP, Dukes of Hazzard, Benson, etc.) competing against each other.

Someone mentioned that a 2nd volume was in the works...I look forward to it, but in the meantime, this set will prove more than satisfying to any Feud fans out there...pick it up today!",1200096000,,733,4.911290322580645
3260513,2,B000YDBP52,"The first impression I got from this set was a bad one - on none of the discs does it say which episodes are on which disc, so it's kind of a chance game as to which is which. Then, the interior case is confusing and I still don't know how to get to the second and fourth discs.

Unlike the far superior Best of the Match Game sets that came out this year, it just seems no extra effort was put in here. The video quality is pretty bad and jittery in some episodes as well.

One thing I WILL say for this set, though, is I do love having all of these classic episodes collected in one place. I just wish the presentation had been a bit better and that there had at least been an effort to avoid the jittery picture.",1199836800,8,715,3.9583333333333335
3260514,4,B000YDBP52,"There have been so many game shows that have been definitive. While the shows itself have shown new life, the hosts on the other hand, have not delivered the originality we often loved before. There is no other game show that has stated that point like Family Feud. No matter who has hosted the show whether it was the late Ray Combs, Louie Anderson, Richard Karn from Home Improvement, or the latest host John O' Hurley, we will always think of the original master of the feud, Richard Dawson. During his original 9 year run from 1976-1985, Family Feud really delivered as one of the definitive game shows of all time in syndication and on ABC. The show has also appealed well from its constant airing on GSN, and now there are feuds that are returning to the light for the first time in years, which are now on home video for the first time ever.

All-Star Family Feud is a 4 disc DVD set showcasing your favorite celebrities playing your favorite game show with surveys. The collection primarily focuses in on special primetime episodes from Richard's ABC edition from the 70's and 80's which include your favorite stars from shows like Soap, Loni Anderson from WKRP In Cincinatti, Susan Lucci from All My Children, and the cast of The Brady Bunch. The DVD also includes some episodes from the syndicated edition including the 1985 Hollywood Walk Of Fame week, which also features the feud creator, the late great Mark Goodson, as well as actress and T.V. pioneer Betty White and Ceasear Romero. The shows are refreshing to watch, some of them also have never been aired on GSN before, and bring in a great appeal to those who've loved Dawson's days when he used to say survey said.

While we've seen game shows recently that came to DVD as board games like Jeopardy and The Price Is Right, the actual episodes are much more fun to watch. Family Feud has had many DVD game editions, but this DVD set is definitely the best. I loved watching these great shows for the first time, and if you are a fan of classic game shows, you'll absolutely love All-Star Family Feud as a part of your DVD collection.
