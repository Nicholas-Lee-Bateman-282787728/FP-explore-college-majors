8246874,4,B0012N3A60,This is an old surfing documentary from the seventies.  If you're a fan of seventies style surfing this is one to add to your library.  I particularly like the San Francisco Beach surfing done by local guys (many of whom still surf there but more seasoned and older of course.),1417305600,,277,4.52
