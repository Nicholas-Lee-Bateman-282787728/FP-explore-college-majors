8303625,5,B001G21KVY,"Having grown up with Father, Msgr., Bishop Sheen it is always good to hear his voice and as a devotee of the Tridentine mass I find this video very uplifting especially when circumstances force me to attend a Novus Ordo mass.",1434844800,,225,4.512195121951219
8303626,5,B001G21KVY,I like that this Mass is explained and Catholics who go the the Novus Ordo (New Order) mass should see this and use their God given wisdom to think about which one is the real Mass,1355270400,4,180,4.027777777777778
8303627,5,B001G21KVY,In Chicago 1940 this black and white video recording of the sung High Easter Mass in Our Lady of Sorrows Church was filmed. This film remastered into a DVD is an excellent dramatic presentation of the Immemorial Mass complete with choir and orchestral accompaniment. As is explained in the product description Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen reverently explains the meaning of the Mass in detail as we see it celebrated for our edification. The full meaning of all parts of the Mass are explained and this is well worth watching.,1279756800,2,524,4.898876404494382
