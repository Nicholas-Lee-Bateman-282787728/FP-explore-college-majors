2566865,5,B000FIGJ84,"At last I understand why President Bush ordered the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq -- he is following the 400+ year plan of Sir Francis Bacon and Queen Elizabeth I, as his own words during his Second Inaugural Address proves conclusively!  This documentary is one of the best I have ever seen, as it proves its points with excellent documentation and ever better camera work and scriptwriting.

This film deserves the accolades it has received from the New York Film Festival!

If you know in your heart that something is not right with America, but cannot put your finger on the problem, this video will enlighten you!",1148515200,36,622,4.794392523364486
2566866,5,B000FIGJ84,"Wow!  Get a notebook and pen handy and get the history lesson you never learned in school, or college!  This is such an advanced and contemporary DVD, I feel I learned more in an hour than all my years in school.  It's so in depth and has such detail, that it's hard not to believe the claims made in the DVD.  There is so much evidence given, that it is absolutely convincing. Great!!",1147478400,10,385,4.232876712328767
2566867,5,B000FIGJ84,"""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings"" presents eye-opening information about the true founding of our country. It will transform your understanding of history and help you better understand current world events. It makes compelling arguments about the future of our nation.

I highly recommend this documentary and believe that everyone should watch it, as it unravels historical facts that are not taught in school. I was amazed to hear about the plan for the New Atlantis, and the influence of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Francis Bacon and secret societies on the founding of America. I was blown away by the dealings of Benjamnin Franklin and how his connections to the French and British secret societies influenced his work.

The documentary establishes a common thread behind the very beginnings of our country, all the way through current events (such as the Iraq war), and the future destiny of America.

The production quality is excellent, with powerful footage, insightful re-enactments, and dynamic musical score. It was great to see Rosslyn Chapel footage, and learn more about the Knight Templars, especially after hearing so much about them from the Da Vinci Code.

Buy this DVD, and get informed, so that you can make a difference in the way your children view the future! I am a mother of two children, and I want to make sure that they learn the true history of our nation. I also want to take a pro-active approach in their understanding of the future.  This documentary is a great tool to equip parents to better explain the past and the present to their children, so that they can grow up with a realistic view of what is going on.",1147392000,20,1650,4.899641577060932
2566868,5,B000FIGJ84,"This is one of the most important videos you'll see. It is fundamental to educating oneself to the country he lives in. It explains why the betrayals are happening to us today by both parties. I have been studying this subject for at least 18 years and can say this is the only film that I know of that gives the most accurate information on the subject. Most things are in symbols but we don't know how to read them as that is a secret. For example JFK wasn't assassinated on some street. He was sacrificed in the elm grove as per ritual, in an open air Masonic temple. That car was driving down Elm Street when he was assassinated. Go to Dealey Plaza look around and see the Eastern Stars, the reflecting pool of Isis, reflecting Osiris with the flame of light at the top and on and on. Look at a map of the same and see the streets as they form a truncated (those famous railroad tracks) pyramid. Then follow Main Street as it then forms 3 pyramids from the one. You will learn where the idea for liberty in the new world came from and where it all went in the opposite direction. Learn the names behind the great work. Learn what those in the know call conspiracy and which some say has turned into consensus. Show this film to all your friends. They'll ask you how they can get a copy. Like it or not you won't waste a penny on this one.",1147305600,2,1342,4.205426356589148
2566869,5,B000FIGJ84,"Secret Mysteries is is technically accurate and introduces us to one of history's most fascinating individuals: Sir Francis Bacon.

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history that has not suffered from revisionism.",1147305600,2,225,5.617647058823529
2566870,5,B000FIGJ84,"This is simply an excellent DVD. I enjoyed it very much. The information provided will completely astound you. This film is an excellent introduction to the New World Order conspiracy that is being played out right before our eyes. Christian Pinto does a brilliant job of tying together many loose threads. He clearly did exhaustive research on the topic, and goes to great lengths to provide clear documentation throughout. Exploring a subject like the esoteric is a vast undertaking, and the subject is one not easily understood. However, Mr. Pinto has done an outstanding job of explaining to those of us who might be new to the subject. From the ancient to the modern, he ties it all together and provides a clear picture of how we have come to this point in time - the New World Order.",1147219200,3,790,4.690647482014389
2566871,5,B000FIGJ84,"Generally I am very much against conspiracy theories. Men like Mike Hoggard and Alex Jones make my skin crawl when I think about the crazy stories that they spin. However, Christian Pinto is very unique. Rather that pulling his ideas out of thin air with nothing to back him up, he presents his theories based on professional opinions and evidence from history. I very much appreciate the way that he doesn't play to the emotions but rather tries to portray the facts.

I found this documentary to be very enlightening and intriguing. The main point of this DVD in particular is to prove that America was heralded as the ""New Atlantis"" (originally spoken of by Solon) by all the secret societies. I think it does a stelar job, especially when speaking of John Dee and Sir Francis Bacon. Pinto also makes a point of examining the arguments from both sides before showing his conclusions. For example, when talking about how he believes that Bacon was the real author of William Shakespeare's theatrical plays, he didn't just go to those who agree with him, rather he also went to others who didn't agree with him in order to hear their arguments first hand.

I found this DVD to be very informative and interesting, and I can't wait to watch the next part of the series.",1340841600,2,1269,4.660714285714286
2566872,5,B000FIGJ84,"Well, My title is a little provocative, and in fact many Americans know that many of our founders belonged to secret societies and incorporated many esoteric beliefs and symbols into our nation. And this film confirms there always was the side by side aspect of American being a majority Christian nation but at the same time, the elites were dominated by those who belonged to secret societies such as the masons and the order of the Rosy cross.

So what turns history upside down? For one thing the fact that 8 masons murdered a man, for reviling there secrets, and got away with it because masons controlled the court system in the USA. Another thing is just who are Who are the masons and what do they want? Also what founders Fathers were members of the Masons? What was the connection with Alister Crowley? Where do the beliefs of the Masons and other secret societies come from? What does Gnostics, Kabbalist, Esoteric Persian religions and Egyptian religion have to do with thee ""modern"" Beliefs? Was George Washington a leading mason? The speculation about Benjamin Franklin is intriguing was he a spy, a loyal American, or a loyal devotee to Frances Bacon and secret societies? The Importance of Frances Bacon. Who was Shakespeare? Did europeans come to the USA as far back as 800 BC? and lastly why was America founded and for what purpose?

All those questions and more are answered hear, (including what are the secret societies symbols are and what is there major goal or goals) This is an intriguing watch and I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.",1325635200,4,1565,4.771217712177122
2566873,5,B000FIGJ84,"Prior to watching this DVD, I had previously only read superficial articles about this subject.  This documentary provides unique insights on the amasing secret agenda behind the foundation of America and the influence of Freemasonry in the destiny of the most powerful nation on Earth.
The DVD is quite long, but it can be watched by (well organised) chapters, which flow in a very consistent way.
It just leaves you with a sad feeling that if you're not part of the masonic spheres of control, you're just a puppet, a slave of their system of power.",1295654400,,551,4.739583333333333
2566874,1,B000FIGJ84,The director (Pinto) ignores how Freemasonry has dramatically changed. The Freemasonry movement of several centuries ago was vastly different than the Freemasonry we see today. Albert Pike substantially changed Freemasonry doctrine and philosophy after the Civil War. All of Pinto's work should be examined carefully due to such consistently sloppy scholarship. He leans toward delusional conspiracy hypotheses. Don't waste your money on Pinto products.,1292976000,5,453,6.09375
2566875,5,B000FIGJ84,"wow!  they  don't  teach you  any  of  this  in  school, I  must  of  watched  this  5 times already. It  will  surprise  you  what  the ENLIGHTENED  ones  have  in  store  for  America.  Excellent,  highly  recommended.",1266624000,3,220,4.705882352941177
2566876,5,B000FIGJ84,"This documentary is very good, with only a few criticisms: some really bad acting (especially in ""Capt. William Morgan"" segment), some repetitive use of acting segments and they do chase a couple of rabbit trails to nowhere.

With that said, the documentary is well worth the money.  There is GREAT information that you will not find in most documentaries regarding the founding of our nation and, I would guess, some information that you will not find anywhere--especially in such a quality program.  I especially appreciated the information on Freemasonry.

Most Americans probably have little or no knowledge about the influence of Francis Bacon on our founding.  And I have met few who know the truth about William Shakespeare.  (I have been called a ""nut"" when sharing this information, but they always backtrack when I mention Mark Twain's book and his well-established conclusions on the matter.)

Most of us will want to watch this several times.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1251072000,4,984,5.10625
2566877,5,B000FIGJ84,"Very interesting! I love this kind of information! I don't trust the government, and this video under scores my train of thought. I am pleased with my purchase, and am glad I watched it. Even happier I own it. This DVD is ""underground' thinking, and most ""sheeple"" don't want to know. I DO.
Give me facts- let ME decide.",1244332800,5,320,4.440677966101695
2566878,5,B000FIGJ84,"If you really want to know the low-down on the true story of America's Secret Beginnings, then look no further.  One warning though, this isn't what you learned in school, but its all sourced and documented. It'll change how you look at this country and the world forever.",1243382400,4,272,4.666666666666667
2566879,5,B000FIGJ84,"This is a very interesting documentary.  It covers so much that our history books have left out, and explains a lot of what goes on in our government. I highly recommend this video along with the second volume ""Riddles in Stone"".",1239321600,4,229,4.585365853658536
2566880,5,B000FIGJ84,"I highly recommend these films The New Atlantis and volume II Riddles In Stone. These are brilliant documentaries that reveal the truth of America's secret origins and symbolism from the ancient mysteries. The films focus on the intentions of Francis Bacon and the founding fathers in creating a new Atlantis, a nation of enlightenment that would lead the world into a new order of the ages. These films are very detailed and very well crafted. Puts focus on secret societies and men like Bacon, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Pike, and the great works of Manly P. Hall. These films are a must see.",1208995200,8,593,4.823529411764706
2566881,5,B000FIGJ84,"I liked this documentary so much.
It is a first part of a series about occult history of the United States.
You will be amazed.
Guaranteed!!!",1187654400,2,141,4.461538461538462
2566882,3,B000FIGJ84,"I found this volume 1 very long, yet interesting.  It felt as though they went off the topic sometimes, and gave in-depth opinion and facts about certain people, but it was still interesting.  I was a bit disappointed with the special effects and the acting.  They use one acting scene too often.",1184198400,,296,4.653846153846154
2566883,5,B000FIGJ84,Great dvd. The second one is even better. Can't wait for the third. It has alot of great information on it. It's a three hour tour..a three hour tour.,1179360000,,150,4.206896551724138
2566884,5,B000FIGJ84,"Every American should watch this--it will give you a great perspective on our modern America. This movie will, at the very least, cause you to question many things you may have taken for granted (like the pyramid and eye on the back of our dollar bill--an occult symbol meant to pave the way for a new world order!).

I could write forever about this movie, but in consideration of the reader I will keep my message simple: Watch the movie! It's well worth it.",1178755200,,460,4.476190476190476
2566885,5,B000FIGJ84,"As Mr. Francis Bacon said himself ""Knowledge is power"". This is only Volume I in what is believed to be 7 Volumes. This volume talks about birth of USA, who, how, when, and why. Was it pre-planned to ""discover"" America when Columbus - or is it Colon as his real name was- discovered it? Who else knew about this land, Vikings, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Francis Bacon and John Dee (original 007)? This film is over 2 hours long, so seat back and suck in all the info that will be thrown your way. Great presentation, great narration, different number of researchers presenting their views. Must have DVD, second volume came out as well, must see too, talks about secret architecture of Washington D.C.",1174780800,4,698,4.729508196721311
2566886,5,B000FIGJ84,"For better or for worse this DVD will shake your rafters. I found this one especially useful in my pursuit of arcane knowledge. It connected a lot of dots I had lingering in my mind.

The animations and video quality are excellent! Very well done. I'm looking forward for more.

2566887,5,B000FIGJ84,"I really enjoyed this documentary. Secret Mysteries Vol. One is packed with great interviews, graphics and amazing facts about some of the plans and ideas behind the beginnings of America. The part about Shakespeare was amazing.  A must see, A definite five star video! It is also a great tool for use in small group discussions. Can't wait for Vol. Two.",1172448000,,354,4.80327868852459
2566888,5,B000FIGJ84,"This is a great documentary, filled with powerful and unique information not included in most histories of America.  The 1-star reviewer who has criticized the film mentions issues that mostly appear nowhere on screen.  He is drawing conclusions based upon his personal suspicions, rather than any concrete evidence pertaining to the film.  ""Gord"" suggests that producer, David Bay, is in support of the Ecumenical Movement -- but fails to mention that Bay's Cutting Edge website ([...]) strongly condemns Rome, the Vatican, and the Ecumenical movement (check out the ""Thus Saith Rome"" section of the site).  Bay also does not support Pat Robertson, but exposes him as one of the pastors who has taken money from Rev. Sun Yung Moon (a false teacher who says that he is greater than Jesus Christ).

Furthermore, this film NOWHERE mentions the King James Bible, neither does it suggest (AT ALL) that Francis Bacon ""translated"" the KJV (a popular belief among occultists).  Also, the film's writer/director, Christian J. Pinto, is a strong supporter of the King James translation -- something ""Gord"" seems unaware of.  Meanwhile, the leading Baconian scholar in the film (Peter Dawkins) has stated elsewhere that ""no records"" exist of Bacon's involvement with the KJV, and that the KJV translators are well known and that Bacon was not among them.  David Bay has likewise repeated this information in at least one radio interview.  While Bay's views on the KJV are controversial, his contention is not with the translation, but rather, with the esoteric artwork drawn onto the pages of the early KJV editions (which are beyond dispute).

But the real story with ""Secret Mysteries"" has to do with the influence of Sir Francis Bacon on the founding of America, through the secret societies of Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism.  The film reveals that while Christians came to America through the Puritan/Pilgrim movement, they were not alone.  With them came certain esoteric groups that believed America was destined to become a philosophic empire that would one day extend to all the world.  What the film is really telling us is that Bacon's ""New Atlantis"" and the current drive toward a ""New World Order"" are one and the same thing.

Also, the film reveals that Bacon referred to himself as the ""Herald of the New Age"" who came to herald ""the coming of the Christ"" (according to Peter Dawkins).  As such, Bacon's New Atlantis was designed to lay the groundwork for what will eventually become the kingdom of Antichrist -- prophesied in the Bible.  This is why this documentary is important to Christians.",1159660800,33,2600,5.068075117370892
2566889,5,B000FIGJ84,"This documentary will have you hooked from beginning to end, you must watch it at least twice to get all the information to sink in, there is so much fascinating info, you will probably want to watch it more than that.  Excellent graphics, interviews and footage.  Unashamedly tells the truth and in great detail.  A must watch for any history buff or layman!!",1150934400,9,360,4.682539682539683
2566890,5,B000FIGJ84,"After much anticipation, I was finally able to view the new DVD from Cutting Edge entitled ""Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings - Vol I. - The New Atlantis"". Having seen the 15 minute preview of the DVD, I knew it was going to be top of the line when finished and I was not disappointed.

The approach to the two-sided coin surrounding the beginning of this nation, reveals so many hidden plans and strategies that many involved from the beginning were not even aware of. The amount of documentation is staggering and I will be viewing it several times in order to glean it all.

The quality of the production is excellent and definitely History Channel caliber. It certainly ""wets your appetite"" for the addition presentations forthcoming. The only downside is the amount of time we will have to wait

for the next volume to be released. This truly is a masterpiece and very evident that it has been twelve years in the making. This will prove to be a classic for a long time to come. How imperative someone has finally approached such an important documentary of the two sided coin of the beginning of these United States.",1149724800,5,1129,4.663316582914573

8122906,4,B000FIGJ84,"I found it very well done relating to the hypothesis that the Colonies were really established at least partly by Free Masons to extend their hold into the New World and make it a nation based around Masonry. Most other DVD's similar to this didn't make the connections with Elizabeth I and Francis Bacon, which are delved into in this DVD, so it does go a step beyond.

The only reason that I did not give it a 5 was because I had hoped that it would continue on tracing all of the US Presidents who were Masons and perhaps even delve into if there was any Masonic influence in the Civil War. But it didn't..",1385856000,,609,4.25
