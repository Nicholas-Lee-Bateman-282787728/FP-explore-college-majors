West Bank Story description is EXTREMELY misleading. The title would suggest that it is the ""West Bank Story"" 2006 Academy Award Winner as it is in the same location.  Very confusing.  What I received was in small print ""To Snap or not to snap.""",1190332800,,507,7.859649122807017
8167175,5,B000M8N5XY,"I expected to watch that depressing short film that won the oscar.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!!! This production is FANTASTIC!!!!!  Who knew law students were so talented?

The actor who plays THE RIFF is especially talented...and handsome.  Although the guy who plays Pro Bono is more muscular and quite handsome in his own right, he just doesn't have the edge THE RIFF has.  Somebody get those guys an agent!!!!!!!!!!!!",1176163200,8,426,5.0285714285714285
8167176,3,B000M8N5XY,I though this was going to be the short that won the Academy Award for 2006 best short film.  Turns out it was the full play done by the law school.  Not what I expected.,1175904000,2,170,3.8285714285714287

8167178,2,B000M8N5XY,Be certain - this is not the winner of the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film... it's a student production from University of Minnesota Law School.,1172534400,31,150,4.592592592592593
