Two times when I wish I could have been there were  to see Christo's Gates in NYC installed and to see this art piece arrive in LA. Just an amazing undertaking and film.",1476489600,,307,3.873015873015873

8678865,4,B00NLJJHMO,"Levitated Mass (2013 release; 89 min.) is a documentary about sculpture artist Michael Heizer. As the documentary opens, we hear news announcements along the lines of New York has the Statue of Liberty, Washington has the Monument, and now LA has its own signature landmark, and that introduction certainly intrigued me (although it begs the question, isn't the Hollywood sign LAs signature landmark?). Soon we are introduced to Michael Heizer, a sculpture artist who evolves away from galleries to making land art. His lifelong ambition is to make a massive monolithic sculpture that is bigger than anything ever seen. To tell you more might spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from well-known and respected documentarian Doug Pray (hes previously brought us other documentaries like Big Rig and Art & Copy, just to name those). Pray composes the documentary into four distinct parts: (i) the introduction to Heizer and his works (fascinating for those of us know knew little about the man before seeing this documentary), (ii) the prep work for transporting the 340 ton boulder to the LA County Museum of Art, (iii) the actual trek across 105 mi. and 22 cities (which takes up about half of the documentary), and (iv) the epilogue in which the rock is installed and opened to the public (in 2012). I have to say that I was quite surprised how the 105 mi. journey over 10 days and nights became such a peoples event (one of the roadside spectators comments its our rock now, it doesnt matter what [Heizer] thinks, ha!). Last but not least, the documentary features a very nice soundtrack of mostly instrumental pieces, composed and performed by Brooklyn indie band Akron/Family.

I am by no means an expert in this field. I am simply someone who is interested in art, and love a good story, while hopefully learning something along the way. On that account, Levitating Mass delivered in all respects, and this documentary flew by in no time. Not to mention that upon my next visit to LA, going to see this art work in person will be at the top of my to do list. Levitated Mass is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1423353600,2,2199,4.78421052631579
8678866,5,B00NLJJHMO,"For me the interesting part of the movement of this very large rock were all the opinions (some quite insightful, some predictable) as to - ""What is art.""
Secondarily, it reminded me of all the fake rocks as well as metal and concrete structures that public (or even private) monies are spent for public art in cities in which we are already immersed in an overly synthesized world of concrete, metal and artificiality. Hear that Seattle!",1421539200,,438,4.776315789473684
8678867,5,B00NLJJHMO,"49:29: ""We're living in a time when I think there's a lot of people who feel jaded, and someone has the vision to say, 'I want to take something so big and so massive and put it in the middle of the Los Angeles basin,' and an engineer had to say, 'Okay, well, how do we do that?' I definitely feel emotional when I think about it. Everyone, you know, has this journey that we're all on that seems impossible when you're facing it, and to, like, know that if you just take it one day at a time, you always end up, somehow, on the other side, looking back and saying, 'That was difficult, but it shaped me into who I am.'""",1419033600,4,620,4.048780487804878
