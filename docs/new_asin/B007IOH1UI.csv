5089533,4,B007IOH1UI,"I fell in love with Telemundo's ""El Clon"" from the beginning! For years I've been looking for it on DVD and finally found it on here. However I was so happy, that I didn't realize that it's not the complete version! A lot of the novela is skipped, therefore missing some crucial parts. Although I'm happy to have at least part of it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone watching it for the first time. It'll get confusing if you don't already know what's happening!",1353196800,9,463,4.458823529411765
5089534,4,B007IOH1UI,"It's good but too short in DVD I saw some chapters before in Telemundo and I new it is a good drama but after we watched at home from our DVD s we realize this version is too short but still good you won't be disappointed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Clon-DVD/dp/B007IOH1UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Clon DVD</a>",1349136000,2,360,6.078431372549019

Whoever has the DVD of the 2012 version or the 2001 version, please give it to amazon so that I may purchase it! I have been searching and almost came to the conclusion that it would just be a memory.",1342051200,3,360,4.46969696969697
5089536,1,B007IOH1UI,"This is simply a terrible re-make of the first Clon. The acting is bad and the most beautiful part of the original which was the dancing was horrible. The original is much better. People do not waste your money on this version, I was very disappointed.",1341014400,32,252,4.5

5089545,1,B007IOH1UI,"I don't usually write reviews, but honestly this Telemundo version doesn't have anything to do with the original.  Starting with the actress Echavarria, sorry but she was horrible, everything was off. Not even Mauricio Ochman could save it. If I could would have given zero stars, that's how bad it is.

8517690,3,B007IOH1UI,"First of all, I'd like to express my dislike to those people who come here and give this product a bad rating because it's a remake of the Brazilian telenovela, and that has nothing to do with this DVD, nor this show. Keep your disliking and displeasure for yourself and watch the original version if you don't like this one.

Back to the product, I must mention that this DVD is too expensive. I know it's an exclusive Mexican edition, but the price is very high and the product's real value isn't that much. The ""box set"" is from paper outside and inside it has glued plastic on the paper. So, really cheap, it's not even a box which can be closed, more like a mini-book.

The other thing that disappointed me a lot is the picture format. This telenovela was shot in 16:9 ratio (widescreen) and this DVD brings it in 4:3 ratio which is a very bad thing for me.

As for the editing, it's good, but I must mention that really a lot of scenes were cut out, like too much. The editing is focused on the love story between Jade and Lucas and it has every important scene of them together and characters who affect their destinies. As for the secondary characters like Cristina, her friends, Dora, Osvaldo, Lucas and Marisa's family friends, Leonardo's friends, teenagers, they all barely appear. Also, the humour scenes are cut out, there's only a few and this telenovela was also very funny. However, for someone who already watched it complete, it's not gonna be a problem. For those who didn't, there'll be little holes, but you'll gonna get the point of the story. You must reconsider that this telenovela has 184 episodes and that this kind of editing is a must. Also, you can't expect from publishers to bring you the whole telenovela because an average telenovela has more than 130 episodes and it would be more than 15 DVDs at least.

Three stars because of the aspect ratio and the price. I don't recommend for buying to those who aren't huge fans of the show or who haven't watched it at all just because of the price. You can watch it whole online and if you really like it, then buy this. However, I'm grateful for this edition because I wouldn't ever have time to watch it whole again.",1452729600,4,2195,4.48

8517693,1,B007IOH1UI,"I bought this several years ago THINKING (erroneously) that it was the ORIGINAL (Brazil) dubbed in Spanish  HOWEVER, when I saw the first hour of this one advertised.it was then. and STILL IS.AWFUL !! Gross!! The WORST!!  Re-made in Miami.it is enough to gag a maggot.  TELEMUNDO should be ashamed if itself for re-making such an AWFUL production of the wonderful original.  This deserves ten MINUS stars!!!  Thank goodness the ORIGINAL El Clon (dubbed in Spanish) is being shown again during 2015...  And, I am watching every moment of it.",1435449600,4,540,4.944444444444445
