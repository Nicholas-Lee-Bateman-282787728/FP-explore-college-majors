Bert the turtle encouraging children to duck and cover in the event of an atomic bomb blast evokes so many happy memories of the civil defense training I had in the late 60's and early 70's growing up in Seattle.

Use every year, every period, it entertains and amuses.",1239321600,,423,4.435897435897436
