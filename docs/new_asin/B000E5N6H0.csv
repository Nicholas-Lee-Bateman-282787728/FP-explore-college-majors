2494256,4,B000E5N6H0,"MACKINAC's ""AESOP'S FABLES FROM VAN BEUREN STUDIOS"" is packed with unusual extras, as well as sixteen b&w 1930s animated shorts.

Amadee Van Beuren began in 1920 with Paul Terry (of later TERRY TOON fame) with silent Aesop's Fables cartoons. The sound-era Van Beuren shorts were often orchestrated by Winston Sharples (who would have a long career with Paramount's Famous Studios animation division). Van Beuren ceased operation in 1936, after losing his distribution deal with RKO.

8106130,5,B000E5N6H0,"To set this in perspective I'm now 70 + years old.  Back when I was a child in the 1940s I was introduced to Van Beuren cartoons by having them shown (on 16mm) at one of my birthday parties. Later in the 1950s these film became a staple of local (Philadelphia) children's television programming. Years later I purchased a 16mm rental library because it had a number of these films in it. Alas time has made these film too fragile to screen any longer.  This DVD solves that problem.

Steve Stanchfield, and his Thunderbean Animation, have done a great job rescuing these examples of early animation. They are presented in chronological order by release date and have some restoration done to them. While a few specks show up now and then the visual are sharp and display a good grey scale.  The audio is amazing considering the age of these films. But Stanchfield has included a treasure chest of bonus features in this set spanning character development art, marketing materials, and even several audio examples of the recorded (early 78 rpm releases) work of the company's musical director at that time Gene Rodemich.

Yes the humor on these cartoons will probably not amuse the children of today but these films are a kind of time capsule allow those of us living in the 21st century to see what was funny in the early days of the 20th century. This set is a must have for anyone who has an interest in the development of animation and the output of a pioneer studio.",1343692800,26,1470,4.595419847328245
