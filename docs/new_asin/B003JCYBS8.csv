4129469,4,B003JCYBS8,"This is the first of three times that Mike Henry plays Tarzan, who is now no longer what his creator thought of him, but an international super hero, a strong man called upon by people of different nations to come and help them. In the last episode, Tarzan, played by another man, parachuted into Thailand. In this 1966 episode, he flies into Mexico dressed in a business suit and is attacked by a gunman who tries to kill him. He responds like a James Bond secret agent and kills his attacker. In fact, the first quarter of this entertaining film is much like James Bond, except for the music. There is even a gadget, as in the Bond series; however, it is used by the criminal, perfectly played by David Apatoshu.

 Tarzan's mission is to find, protect, and deliver home an Aztec boy who has been kidnapped. The kidnappers want the boy to reveal to them where his hidden home filled with gold is located. Tarzan drops his suit, and scantily dressed in the well-known Tarzan outfit of a skimpy bathing suit type pants runs off with the help of a monkey, a leopard, and a lion. He does take along a knife and rope to fight a well equipped army with a tank and submachine guns, but what else will Tarzan need? This is a fine film, and viewers will enjoy it.",1320019200,7,1255,4.381974248927039
4129470,3,B003JCYBS8,"Tarzan meets Goldfinger!!! What the h---? Zubin Mehta may not be my absolute favorite conductor-but he has a gorgeous wife, Nancy Kovack-and she never looked better than in this movie. Unfortunately, every time I watch this, and see Mike Henry's abs, I feel I should run to the gym and do 500 crunches (could I do them over a month maybe?) This had to be influenced by the Bond films, since Tarzan looks like Sean Connery in the opening sequence (or at least Matt Helm). The nice thing is I don't have to listen to the inane dialogue-in fact I'm playing the Vladar/Wadsworth recording of the Beethoven 4 and 5 concerti in the background, because there is no plot! Gotta love the fact that Henry's and Kovack's hair never moves. I didn't know they had so many beauty parlors around the Mayan ruins, did you? Plus, the Mayan Chief looks like a refugee from the Central European casting lot!",1319846400,5,888,4.591194968553459
4129471,4,B003JCYBS8,"Too often, this film is referred to as a ""James Bond Tarzan"". But when I saw Mike Henry get off the plane in a suit, I was pleased to see Edgar Rice Burroughs (not Ian Fleming) had finally made it to the screen. This is Burrough's Tarzan as any literate Lord of the Jungle fan knows. And Mr. Henry looks awesome in that suit. If you told someone to pick up Tarzan at the airport, you would have little trouble finding this guy! My God, that physique-it's a million dollars of special effects right there. Many fans of the series agree, nobody nailed the image of Tarzan better than Mike Henry. It's a terrible shame the producers almost literally worked him to death by his third and final appearance in Tarzan and the Jungle Boy. Mike's three films were shot back to back mostly under miserable conditions in Brazil. A little less greed and more foresight would have led to his keeping the role for the TV series.
But back to Valley of Gold. Production was excellent for it's budget and I love him using modern weapons Tarzan style, especially the bolo-grenades. This was almost entering Philipe Jose Farmer territory, a storyline I wish had happened rather than trying to appeal to a younger audience. A more adult oriented Tarzan wouldn't appear until that Greystoke abomination in the Eighties. So we are left with a bridge to a more sophisticated Tarzan that is so tantilizing close to what Burroughs wrote of.",1312588800,5,1415,4.6414342629482075
4129472,4,B003JCYBS8,"Boy is this a movie.  We are first introdued to Tarzan (the ape man) as he steps off a modern, 60s-era jet plane, suitcase in hand and tailored suit clinging to his Tarzan-y body.  A man dressed as a chauffeur approaches him: ""Are you the one they call Tarzan?""  ""Yes, I am,"" replies the one they call Tarzan.  And we're off. -- This movie, one of three starring Mike Henry, tries (and mostly succeeds) in marrying the popular James Bond movies with the Tarzan world.  In this Tarzan, the Lord of the Jungle sips martinis and adjusts his tie and accepts rides from strangers.  But when the Cheetah pooh hits the fan, he dons his loin cloth, grabs the biggest knife available and tracks villains in the jungle, using only his keen Tarzan senses.  Is it fun?  Oh, yeah.  Is it silly?  Oh, yeah.--This curiosity is actually a very fun ride.  Tarzan ends up in a vast city of gold, helping the natives there thwart bad guys who would have the city for themselves. -- Mike Henry makes a suitably James Bond-looking Tarzan, and the opening credits along (which recall Dr No and Goldfinger) are almost (but not quite) worth the price of admission alone.  To say they don't make them like this anymore is an understatement.  I don't think they ever made them like this, except this one time.  It's as fun as any Tarzan-James Bond hybrid can be.  And if you really want to know what's worth the price of admission: When Tarzan takes out a would-be assassain with a huge mock-up of a bottle of Coca Cola.  Now THAT'S worth the price of admission.",1298505600,5,1536,4.490974729241877

4129474,3,B003JCYBS8,"This was the first Tarzan movie starring Mike Henry. Mike Henry has the physique and rugged good looks to be one of the greatest Tarzans of all time. Unfortunately, he is trapped in a low budget movie with poor direction and a lame plot. It is an disappointing movie. The only redeeming point is Mike Henry's athletic ability and rugged physique.",1285977600,5,346,4.688524590163935
4129475,4,B003JCYBS8,"I've been searching for a few of my favorite Tarzan films for many years and I am pleased to spread the word that Warner Archives has released several Tarzan titles and many other rare films on DVD. I watched many Tarzan films as a kid mostly the films starring Johnny Weissmuller, but I watched the Tarzan TV series starring Ron Ely and many others Tarzan films starring the various actors to take on the role of the ""Lord of the Apes"".

While I enjoyed seeing this film again, it didn't age well for me as this film is very juvenile even for a Tarzan film. This film features Mike Henry for the first time as the ape man and I have mixed feelings about him playing the character. Henry is likable enough, be his acting is stiff and his hair is way too perfect for my taste. He does serve a purpose though as he is like an evolutionary link between Mahoney and Ely. In this films favor, it does mark the first appearance of Manual Padilla Jr. as Tarzan's boy sidekick who went on to do another Tarzan film(Tarzan and the Great River)and played Jai on the Tarzan TV series I mentioned earlier in this review. Although playing a different character in two films he might as well have been playing Jai from the TV series.

This film is quite bizarre as it starts out like a James Bond film with Tarzan dressed in a business suit or ""monkey suit""(pun intended haha!)...in you will, and out of his normal surroundings. Once he gets back to the jungle, he enlist the help of some of his jungle friends, a Leopard(thanks Karen), a Lion and a Chimpanzee before meeting up with the boy played by Padilla. The entire production to me seems a little phony(more than usual)especially comparing it to 'Tarzan's Three Challenges'. The stock footage is more obvious, the entire story seems more contrived, but once it gets going there are some very cool and memorable scenes. The helicopter grenade battle and the ending in the gold room are what I remembered from my childhood and they did not disappoint me.

If you're a Tarzan fan you are going to want to pick this one up, the Warner release looks pretty good and it does include the trailer, but nothing else. I probably didn't need to own this one, but returning to the format where Tarzan enlist the aid of his jungle friends, it almost seemed like I was watching a pilot for the TV series.",1280793600,2,2333,4.471830985915493
4129476,5,B003JCYBS8,"1966's ""Tarzan and the Valley of Gold"", part of producer Sy Weintraub's continuing effort to both 'update' Tarzan and achieve some fidelity with Edgar Rice Burrough's original vision, was a film three years in the making. His previous Tarzan, Jock Mahoney, was too old to build a franchise around (at 44), and had nearly died from illnesses contracted during the making of ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"", in Thailand, in 1963. Actor and producer had mutually agreed to end their working arrangement (not surprisingly!), and Weintraub now searched for a tall, dark, charismatic athlete-type in his thirties, who could convincingly perform stunts, look good in a loincloth, and would be willing to commit to both movie and television 'Tarzan' projects.

Enter football star Mike Henry...the 6'3"" Los Angeles Rams linebacker, a six-year NFL vet, was doing bit parts at Warner Brothers during the off-seasons, and announced he wished to retire from the game and act full-time. At nearly 30, with a ripped, Adonis-like physique, and swarthy good looks, Henry had already caught the attention of producer Bill Dozier, who was courting him for his upcoming 'Batman' project (long before it turned 'camp', with Adam West), and Weintraub had to act quickly and decisively to commit him to Tarzan (his unwillingness to move quickly a few years earlier had cost him the services of Sean Connery as Tarzan, when Cubby Broccoli tapped him for the role of James Bond). Offering a package of films and television, and a lucrative salary that would increase as the boxoffice of the new series poured in, Henry was dazzled by the offer, and signed. Weintraub arranged to produce three films, nearly simultaneously, in Mexico and Brazil (to save production costs), while beginning production on a full-color television series, in Mexico. It would be a major gamble...

While the first film would be produced, not by MGM, but by 'B' movie studio, American International (Paramount would release the second and third), the excellent director of both ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" and ""Tarzan's Three Challenges"", Robert Day, would helm the new film. A first-rate cast, including Nancy Kovack (a last-minute replacement for Sharon Tate), David Opatoshu, and talented child actor Manuel Padilla Jr. would support Henry, and jungle animals traditionally associated with Tarzan, lions and chimps, which had disappeared in recent Tarzan films, would reappear. The kicker, though, was how to attract film audiences in the midst of the 'James Bond' craze of the 1960s...whether a wise decision or not, the new Tarzan film looked very much like a Bond movie for the first 20 minutes of running time, including flashy opening credits, jazzy music, quick, abrupt violence, a shootout at a public location, and Tarzan, himself, attired in a very Bondian, Fleet Street tan suit, wielding a pistol(!). It may have seemed more 'Doc Savage' than 'Lord Greystoke', but it certainly kept your attention!

Happily, once Henry donned his loincloth, the film settled into a more traditional 'Tarzan' format, and was actually very, very good. The location scenes at an Aztec temple were breathtaking, Henry was excellent at action (if a bit stiff with dialogue), and the fairly standard plot (greedy villains wish to steal Aztec gold), never interfered with the big fights!

The film, sadly, would not be the huge hit Weintraub had hoped, and everyone, at the time, was so busy trying to make the nearly impossible deadlines of the second and third film, there was little time to pause and review what was, and wasn't working. Unfortunately, with a rushed schedule, accidents were bound to happen...but that would be a story better told with the next Tarzan film, 1967's ""Tarzan and the Great River""...",1273708800,23,3753,5.167763157894737
4129477,3,B003JCYBS8,"Released in 1966, Tarzan and the Valley of Gold stars Mike Henry as the ape man who travels to Mexico and tussles with international criminal Vinaro (David Opatoshu), who enjoys ridding his enemies in explosive ways. Vinaro kidnaps a boy, Ramel, whom he thinks will lead him to a lost city of gold. Nancy Kovack is on hand as the requisite babe while Don Megowan plays the intimidating Mr. Train.

This movie has a lot of good elements. For starters, former NFL-player Mike Henry is arguably the best actor to play Tarzan ever, at least as far as looking/acting like Burroughs character goes. Here Tarzan doesnt speak in monosyllables, like the Weissmuller films or early Gordon Scott ones. Hes articulate, intelligent and noble.

Released at the height of the mid-60s James Bond craze, this movie couldve been called The Man from A.F.R.I.C.A., which is an actual line in the movie. Its akin to 007 in a loincloth with various friendly animals (a chimp, a lion and a jaguar). Speaking of which, its amazing what you see Henry and the boy do with the latter two (the boy actually rides the lion!).

Other positives include the last acts inclusion of the incredible Mesoamerican ruins of Teotihuacn in central Mexico, highlighted by the huge Pyramid of the Sun. Today, the sequence wouldve been done with cartoony CGI, but here its all authentic locations and quite impressive.

You might remember the stunning Kovack from the 1968 Star Trek episode A Private Little War where she played the flirtatious and orgasmic Nona. She also had a good role in 1963s Jason and the Argonauts. Unfortunately, while she has some quality screen time, not enough is done with her.

I've heard the argument that Tarzan belongs in mythical Africa not mythical central America, but Burroughs had Tarzan globetrotting a bit, particularly back-and-forth from Europe to Africa, but the story in one book -- ""Tarzan and the Foreign Legion"" -- takes place on the island of Sumatra and another -- ""Tarzan and the Castaways"" -- takes place on a Pacific island inhabited by the remnant of a lost Mayan civilization, which isn't far removed from what he experiences in ""Tarzan and the Valley of Gold."" One book (probably more) he's in the friggin' desert. Basically, as long as Tarzan's in action, fighting evil/corruption and hanging out with nature & animals it's Tarzan.

All the above positives almost compel me to give Tarzan and the Valley of Gold a marginal thumbs up, but something holds it back. For one, theres a semi-goofy kiddie animal section in the second act, which seems incongruous with the serious air of the proceedings. I can live with this flaw, however. So whats the major problem? Theres just something off with the script that prevents the movie from being compelling. The reason all the James Bond films of the 60s through mid-80s were hits is because the producers hired great writers who knew how to make a story flow and keep the movie entertaining. Not so here, but its okay and worth catching if the positives trip your trigger.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Mexico.

4129478,3,B003JCYBS8,"One of the BESt looking Tarzan's in film. One of the BEST portrayed Tarzan movies.

Why, you ask?

Because Tarzan in the books used guns and had an uncanny sense of smell. Tarzan hung out with his pet lion, Jad-bal-ja, along with Manu the monkey. Tarzan spoke eloquently in several languages. Tarzan dressed to the 9's at times, but then reverted back to the savage.

At least in this book, which starts out much like a 007 movie, does ALL of what we mentioned the Burroughs Tarzan does in the books.

At LEAST the producers and writer and director utilized those aspects. We wished it had today's much better fighting sequences.",1425340800,2,629,4.63963963963964
4129479,4,B003JCYBS8,"I had never seen these Tarzan movies, but after hearing about them I was intrigued to see the son of Buford T. Justice from the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies, play Tarzan.  Without having read the first review on this site, when watching, I immediately saw this as a sort of 'James Bond Tarzan'.  The music was the thing that made me feel this way, primarily, but the first 15-20 minutes or so is all James Bondish flash.  I grew up watching the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies on Sunday afternoons.  He will always be the 'real' Tarzan in my book.  However, most of his movies were not nearly as close to the Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan novels.  I only began reading the novels in my adult life and this movie is much closer to those books than the Weissmuller versions.  It's too bad that they didn't stick to the book when making those classic black and white Tarzan flicks.  This turned out to be a much better movie than I expected and I would watch it again.",1420761600,,966,4.418079096045198

4129481,4,B003JCYBS8,"I always liked this movie.  The 1959-61 Gordon Scott Tarzan films may have been the best produced and best scripted, but Mike Henry is a terrific Tarzanespecially since, in this film, he is a sophisticated world traveler who only ""goes native"" when the task at hand calls for it.  Very cool!

There are many eye-popping scenes in this film, which make viewing worthwhile.  However, the weak link is the script: it is generally superficial and un-involving.  The aforementioned Scott films crackled thanks to finely tuned characters whose interactions and circumstances drew us in.  In ""Valley of Gold,"" neither Tarzan nor the supporting cast ever get a chance to say enough to make the viewer feel personally engaged.

Nevertheless, it's a fine looking film and refreshing to see people with combed hair and clothes that fit...among other delights.",1403740800,3,848,5.145985401459854

In 1966, Tarzan and the Valley of Gold ushered in the Mike Henry era which would span three motion pictures. Mike Henry - you know him from films like Mean Johnny Barrows (1976) and Adis Amigo (1976) - was a professional athlete turned actor, and so it's understood that his emoting range is pretty limited. But his days as a linebacker for the Steelers and then the Rams sculpted his physique so that he does look the part of the legendary ape-man. Henry's Tarzan is the globe-trotting sort. In Tarzan and the Valley of Gold, a cable from an old friend deploys him to Central America wherein he gets involved in the rescue of a kidnapped boy (Manuel Padilla, Jr.) and the search for a lost city of gold and the stymying of a sadistic crime lord.

The studio suits weren't at all trying to be subtle in their try to capitalize on the then current James Bond craze. As such, the opening credits treat us to swingin' psychedelic visuals with the accompanying lounge music, followed by Tarzan's arrival in a helicopter, and him sporting a sharp business suit and carrying a briefcase. Some minutes later, the first action beat commences, and it's straight out of the 007 playbook. It's a pretty neat sequence staged in an empty bull ring. It climaxes with an armed goon expiring by way of a runaway giant Coca-Cola bottle. There's a first time for everything.

Aaaand we're done with the James Bond interlude. Tarzan is soon enough in his element, having agreed to assist the local authorities in finding the missing boy. All he asks of them are a rope, a hunting knife, and a soft piece of leather. And there he goes loping into the jungle, now only in loincloth, and accompanied by a lion, a leopard, and a chimpanzee. Cue the convincing wildlife photography.

It turns out, Mike Henry is one of my favorite Tarzans. Partly, it's because he looks the part. But mostly it's the film's approach to Tarzan. My one beef with the Weissmuller version is that his Tarzan communicates in pidgin English. I hated that. Henry's ape-man speaks colloquial English which is loads better than that ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" bullcrap. Ideally, should cinematic Tarzan keep faith with Burroughs' source material, he'd speak English but with a French accent. Or does no one remember Paul D'Arnot?

I also liked the gritty realism infused onto the screen. They did away with all that cutesy-ootsy slapstick with the chimp. There's more focus on action. When I first saw this years ago, you could've bowled me over when Tarzan, faced with troops and armored tanks, picked up a machine gun and proceeded to mow down them mercenaries. And that's not even the most impressive thing he does. Wait 'til he takes out that helicopter. The big bad is superior to villains in other Tarzan films. Augustus Vinaro (David Opatoshu) is a particularly despicable criminal who enjoys toying with his victims. He's got a gimmick. He designs these explosive miniature booby traps. Boy, does he enjoy employing them.

I enjoyed Tarzan and the Valley of Gold for the most part, never mind that it drags in spots and the potential of the romantic subplot is never realized. Yes, there's a lost Aztec city of gold. These suckers pop up every now and then in jungle adventures. This lost city's population is composed of pacifists led by an infuriating bony old chieftain who insists on not fighting back when Vinaro and his men come a-callin'. It's lucky for the placid natives that Tarzan gets his mitts on another machine gun. I betcha he was also wishing he had another giant Coca-Cola bottle to smite them jerks with.",1462579200,,3592,4.748397435897436
8398011,1,B003JCYBS8,"This is a review of the product as manufactured and represented by Amazon, not the actual film itself.  Other buyers be warned.  Amazon lists this product incorrectly.  It is not a DVD.  It is a DVD-R.  I wasn't able to tell until I actually received the item and opened it.  The Amazon website lists it as a DVD, and the case itself says that it is a DVD, but the actual disc is a burned file (you can visually tell from the blue hue of the disc).  What this means is that I'll be able to play the disc once or twice within the next year or so before the carbon begins to break down, causing the film to skip and be afflicted by digital square blips of missing information.

I was wary because other Tarzan films were listed as DVD-R.  I specifically purchased this one because it was the only one of the lot to be listed as a DVD.  The cost for this film is around $15 or $17 I believe (after shipment)which, for a DVD that is fine, but because of the inferior quality of a DVD-R, this should've been no more than $9 or $10.  Hopefully someone employed by Amazon will read this and correct the listing information.

I'm not sure whether to return it or not, as from what I can tell, the film is out of print, as are several other Tarzan films.  If I keep the DVD-R, if I want to have the film last, I'll need to transfer it to a VHS tape.  I'd have to do this because even if I don't watch it, the DVD-R breaks down over time/just sitting there, even without me playing it.  Luckily I have a VCR and the means to do this/I don't mind VHS.  At least the VHS will last.  Because the film is stored on a DVD-R, the image is going to be VHS quality regardless.  And as a lover of film, I want to be able to watch the film multiple times on a TV, not view it through a phone or computer as a stored file.
