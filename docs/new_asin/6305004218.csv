948378,4,6305004218,"I've read articles that Krakatoa is actually west of Java, other than that, this reinactment is based on historical fact, but don't expect a Poseidon Adventure because this film stands on its own two feet and doesn't try to emulate other disaster flicks even though it was filmed long before Irwin Allen's winning streak.",1499040000,,321,4.962962962962963

948380,5,6305004218,"Stickers for historical (rather, geographical) accuracy will note that Krakatoa is West of Java.  The island was the site of the most powerful explosion in record, a volcanic eruption that for a year altered the world's climate, turning the sky red over  London.  The film is a little bit of everything--special effects extravaganza, treasure hunt, suspense film, disaster film, and even a bit of a musical.  It doesn't slavishly adhere to history, but it does portray some of the key events reasonably accurately (e.g., the lighthouse scene).  I pondered what I would have done if, like the main characters, I was faced with the life of death choice of seeking refuge ashore or riding out the tidal wave at sea.  (Won't give it away, but I would have been a goner.).  I loved the movie but if you are looking for a documentary, this isn't it.",1495238400,,843,4.732876712328767
948381,4,6305004218,"This is an exciting film for its time. In general, Baby Boomers will like it. Those born after the 1960s will probably think it is too slow, and the special effects will probably not be sophisticated enough for their taste. It is a great story based on the true events of the explosion and complete disappearance of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 that killed more than 36,000 people. Now, a new volcano has formed in the exact same spot. It is called Anak Krakatoa (Child of Krakatoa) and is also a very violent volcano.",1493510400,,520,4.484210526315789

948386,4,6305004218,"This is a review of the German Filmjuwelen/Alive standard version at 126 minutes. I brought my nose down several inches because of the blunder in the title and tried to watch this. I had no trouble doing so. This is Jules Verne if he were on steroids. It actually appears to be the correct 2:20 to 1 aspect ratio of Super Panavision. It didn't flinch on my 55"" set and is among (or is) the best picture quality I've ever seen on a standard disc. While missing classic status, most of you won't care while leaning back with a box of popcorn.",1439510400,,540,4.303921568627451

948433,5,6305004218,"I saw this movie in 1969 with special sounds effects and a great picture in Cinerama. The story of Krakatoa is true, the volcano killed 36000 people. First off all,it is an adventure on a perilous search for sunken treasure off the island of Krakatoa, also the captain, Maximilian Schell, must deal with convicts on his ship. You have also great sequences of the Balloon around the volcano, it is spectacular and very dangerous. Of course these stories are not true but it is adventure. Unfortunately this DVD is made for a 4/3 TV, you have black bars up and down, left and right, we must adjust the 16/9 TV with the Zoom button. However the picture still a great quality. Now about the sound, it is Mono, but it is not too bad to listen. If the movie come in BLU-RAY i will buy again.",1428537600,,785,4.383561643835616

948437,2,6305004218,"This is a review of the 1998 DVD by Simitar Entertainment, the one with the porthole on the cover and the title in blue letters. Do not buy it unless you just want to see Krakatoa East of Java and you don't care about picture quality. The Amazon listing says the movie is 131 minutes long, the Simitar DVD disk says 124m, but the DVD box says 106m. The actual length of this version is the shortest figure, only 106 minutes. The picture is letterboxed but not in 2.35:1, it is really 2.70:1, meaning one sixth of the screen is missing. What remains is barely watchable. The movie itself is not the best disaster movie ever made, but it is a little too good for this treatment. I would prefer the whole 147m original version. I give the movie 3 stars, but I give this particular DVD maybe one and a half stars.",1410912000,,809,4.294117647058823

948439,3,6305004218,"The picture quality is better than the Anchor Bay release, which offered a widescreen & pan and scan presentation, and no extras.  MGM-UA only provides the widescreen, no extras, but for 2005 issue, why wasn't it presented for 16x9 TVs?  Everything was going that way at the time, so it is my only reason for a lower rating.  Otherwise, movie has exciting special effects against a somewhat dull script.  Since it was a Cinerama release, those redoing Cinerama films should try an updated remaster prior to the 50th Anniversary forthcoming.",1402704000,,540,4.966666666666667
948440,5,6305004218,I heard mention of the Krakatoa volcano on a show about the world's volcanoes and remembered this movie. This order was quickly delivered and in great shape,1392422400,,156,4.814814814814815
948441,3,6305004218,"This cinematic oddity from 1969 is actually interesting in many ways. It was one of the last movies to be filmed in Cinerama (a widescreen process similar to today's IMAX) and one of the first to use stereo Surroundsound. It's also a precursor to the many Irwin Allen disaster flicks of the 1970s such as THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and WHEN TIME RAN OUT not to mention such volcano epics such as DANTE'S PEAK and VOLCANO. It is also has a script that a B movie producer would have turned his nose up at but when you get performers like Maximillian Schell, Brian Keith, Sal Mineo, and SOUTH PACIFIC's Rosanno Brazzi to appear in it along with singing Asian children, female pearl divers, and a Jules Verne style scenario...how can you resist? There appears to be something for everyone in the overall mix within the limits of a G rating. KRAKATOA is Hollywood hokum meets new technology for the special effects were awesome for the time especially if you got to see it on a giant screen as I first did with pre-Dolby Surroundsound. If it could be refitted for today's IMAX theaters it would still be impressive. As it is on this restored MGM DVD it's still worth seeing although there will be black bars on the top and bottom as it has not been anamorphically enhanced. It will bring back memories for many while still being capable of enthralling young children if they see it before they get too exposed to newer stuff.

The time is August 1883, the setting is Krakatoa, an island in the Dutch East Indies (which was actually WEST of Java). A cargo ship named the BATAVIA QUEEN is hoping to recover a cargo of pearls from a recent shipwreck. On board are a variety of characters including the stalwart ship's captain (Schell), a laudanum addicted diver (Keith) and his female entertainer companion, a widow attracted to the captain, an Italian father (Brazzi) and his rebellious son (Mineo) along with a devious convict with plans of his own. The Jules Verne angle comes in with the use of an experimental diving bell that will allow them to go to the ocean floor to recover the pearls (remember this is 1883). Naturally things do not go smoothly as the convicts take over the ship and the celebrated volcano is getting ready to blow. The original running time was to have been 147 minutes but it was cut to 131 minutes for the film's release. This may explain some of the choppy quality of the narrative although nothing could have saved the script which makes Cecil B. DeMille sound like Shakespeare. Still when it's time for the effects, they do not disappoint especially on today's huge flatscreens with impressive sound reproductions. Speaking of DeMille, it's the sort of movie he would have made had he still be around and that should tell you everything you need to know. Good, old fashioned fun from a different era of moviemaking.",1388966400,,2837,4.6626746506986025

948593,5,6305004218,"I was originally interested in this movie because my 5 year old son has a very active
interest in anything that has to do with volcanoes.  I bought it on Ebay from a seller in S. Korea after reading several other reviews , including comments about various versions. I bought the version with the balloon on the front cover of the dvd. It's wide screen. I found the quality of the dvd to be excellent. The sound and the picture quality were great with no flaws that I could detect. It was great watching it on our wide screen tv.

The movie itself is great and the effects were superior for a movie filmed in 1969. The volcano and resulting  tsunami did not disappoint. The story was good, the characters were interesting. If someone were doing it today they would hopefully develop the characters and the plot more, but it was still a great movie. It's the kind of movie that captured my imagination when I was a kid. My son was thrilled and the whole family enjoyed it.",1236643200,,970,4.407821229050279
948594,2,6305004218,"Krakatoa East of Java, is fine for what it is...an older movie. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but still somewhat entertaining. This DVD will more than likely sit on our shelf and collect dust, unlike others in our collection.",1235174400,,230,4.775
948595,4,6305004218,"With lines like ""Don't explode, Chris!"" and that famously geographically mistaken title, it's clear that no-one on the set was taking Krakatoa, East of Java too seriously. Rather than a historically accurate account of the biggest volcanic eruption in recorded history (for that you need to see the BBC's Krakatoa: The Last Day), it's pure hokum that knows it's hokum and shows you where all the money's been spent. High, wide and handsome hokum at that, designed to fill the wide Cinerama screen

The disaster movie formula was already well enough established for the stock characters to be present: Brian Keith's diver with a busted lung and a bottle of laudanum, Rossano Brazzi and Sal Mineo as father and son balloonists, John Leyton's claustrophobic diving bell designer, Barbara Werle's photographer and `soprano', Diane Baker as treasure hunting skipper Maximilian Schell's just-out-of-the-asylum lover, Jacqui Chan's pearl diver... Throw in a cargo of convicts (replaced by orphans and singing nuns for the return voyage) and you can pretty much fill in the blanks in the plot yourself. Subtle it ain't - after Barbara Werle does a striptease for Brian Keith while singing An Old-Fashioned Girl Like Me, the camera cuts to engine pistons hammering away - and Schell might just be Dr Who in an earlier regeneration - his ship's interior is so much larger than its exterior it might as well be called the TARDIS instead of the Batavia Queen - but it's a lot more entertaining than something this silly and clich&eacute;d should be.

True, it's a long voyage as it sets the scene for the big eruption with mysterious fogs and fireballs, with some of Eugene Lourie's special effects reminiscent of the early scenes of his monster movie Gorgo. They only arrive at Krakatoa just in time for the intermission (or what used to be the intermission), the island volcano revealed through the mist in a scene Ridley Scott would borrow for 1492. Once there, there's only time for one big setpiece - Cinerama films always had a `rollercoaster' scene putting the audience in the driving seat of some runaway vehicle, be it a wagon careering down a mountain track in Custer of the West or on a runaway train in How the West Was Won, and here it's a runaway balloon drawn through narrow canyons into the crater - and a quick mutiny of their convict cargo before the volcano blows and the resulting tidal wave threatens to drown the ship as well as the surrounding ports. It may not be exactly photo-realistic or bear much resemblance to what actually happened, but for lovers of classic special effects and pyromaniacs alike the model explosions at least provide plenty of colourful fun that even John Leyton's Charlie Chaplin impersonation or the singing nuns can't dampen. It's the kind of film that can be easily filed under `guilty pleasure,' but it's certainly a lot more spectacular and entertaining than When Time Ran Out in the volcanic eruption stakes.

MGM/UA's DVD is a fine 2.35:1 transfer with rich colour and good detail. Sadly there are no extras and the overture and intermission are missing, but other than that it is the full-length roadshow version rather than the 105-minute reissue version available on extremely poor quality public domain DVDs. The Anchor Bay DVD also offers a  fullscreen version. The other current Region 1 transfers  should  be avoided  at  all  costs.",1232496000,,3385,4.945422535211268
948596,4,6305004218,"This 1969 version special effects are far better than an early 1950's version,also in color, starring Fred McMurray and Vera Ralston. The original movie version plot was perhaps better, not the special effects, since it offers a more up to date version of this genre. The Mega-Tsunami produced by the explosion of the volcanic island in the 1969 version is awesome and convincing.

948597,5,6305004218,I saw this movie when it first came out in 1969 at The Cinenarama dome in Hollywood California with some friends of mine. Best place to see it the sound and the picture were excellent I really enjoyed the movie the plot was good so was the all star cast you don't find very many movies like that these days. If you must buy it get a really good copy of it and if you have a home thearter set up even better the sound will take you away it will feel like you are in the movie it self. It doesn't matter if it is east or west of Java it's a worth while film. I loved it,1177113600,,567,3.773109243697479
948598,4,6305004218,"You'd think a picture this bad would at least get the title right (Krakatoa is WEST of Java). High production values keep this one a notch above the rest; it is somewhat of a pioneer in the disaster genre. A contrived plot about greed, sunken treasure, young love, old love, etc. seem to only be here to waste our time. I recommend that you skip to #13 in the scene selection and revel in the magnificent Oscar-nominated special effects (it lost to ""Marooned""). There's another huge, all-star cast to create implausible histrionics; I'm regularly amazed that the inept Diane Baker's career lasted as long as it did. (22years later she had a small role in ""Silence of the Lambs"") I still watch the film to be entertained by the bad acting and great effects. Not bad for the price. The Anchor Bay edition is 131 minutes in a widescreen that is clean and clear. Check it out...",1166313600,,874,4.573248407643312

While I remember having seen this when it came out, I too was surprised at how crude the story line was, how few interesting characters there were, and how appalingly loose it was with the facts - afterall, Krakatoa is WEST of Java!!

Thus, in spite of its spearheading the ""better"" disaster films (Towering Inferno, etc.) there is very little to recommend this film on any level.",1152230400,,625,4.504424778761062
948678,5,6305004218,"I really like the diverse cast of this movie. It makes this film work so well. And this is a very entertaining movie. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting is very effective and convincing for the adventure-disaster genre. I particularly liked the beautiful cinematography. Also, the script worked on many levels making it appealing to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and stimulating with great special effects. The only problem is the DVD transfer. I saw this on its initial release and the stereo sound was fantastic. The sound here is mediocre at best.",1149465600,,602,4.798076923076923
948679,4,6305004218,"This movie has always been one of my favorite disaster flicks though it was made in the sixties and before Irwin Allen set up shop in Hollywood and cranked out his own brand of disaster films (in the 70's). The movie boasts some big-name actors and actresses, Brian Keith and Sal Mineo being just a couple, and they're put through their paces for what is mostly a pretty standard and fairly predictable movie.

What set's this film apart are the special effects, which are quite spectacular even by today's standards. In fact the tsunami scenes are the most terrifying (and best) I've seen in ANY movie, including the obviously digitalized wave in the George Clooney flick 'The Perfect Storm'. It's a testament to the creative geniuses in the 60's that their work can go toe-to-toe - and outpunch, the high tech gadgetry of our times.

All in all this is an escapist flick replete with excellent actors given mediocre dialogue and a formulaic plot. The real stars of the film, and the reason to watch, are the volcano and tsunami.",1120262400,,1030,4.716666666666667
948680,4,6305004218,"Krakatoa, East of Java is a grand adventure with a fine international cast diving, ballooning, and dodging volcanic eruptions in technicolor.

Maximilian Schell (Judgement at Nuremburg, The Black Hole) captains an 1883 expedition hunting treasure in a sunken ship between the islands of the title.  Brian Keith (Family Affair) is along to dive in one of those awesome antique suits, but has not informed the captain of  his worn out lungs and laudenum addiction.  Diane Baker seeks her young son at school on one of the islands.  Rossano Brazzi (South Pacific) and Sal Mineo are a father and son aeronaut team, along to search for the shipwreck from aloft in their ballon, which goes off course and right into the mouth of the nearby island volcano, which erupts - based on historical events - and turns their treasure hunt into a rescue mission.

The movie runs slightly over two hours, the first of which is spent, entertainingly,  on character development and so forth.  The second half is well packed with action and special effects.  The final Tsunami scenes are still the best of their kind.  The giant wall of water is scary.

Personally I also liked the melodic theme, appropriate for the exotic location and period.  The acting is excellent, and the special effects excellent for 1969, and still hold up today.  The only major flaw is in the title; I believe ""East"" should have been ""West.""  It doesn't matter.",1119744000,,1419,4.858333333333333

And as things went back in those days, we get some really bad songs including one sung by Barbara Werle in the film called ""I'm an Old Fashioned Girl.""  It's embarrassingly bad.  But the effects are what make this volcanic eruption worth watching.  Remembering this was before CGI came around, the special effects crew does some fine work in assaying the damage that comes from the cataclysmic eruption.  Oscar winner Maximilian Schell looks totally bored, and even Brian Keith as a doomed diver doesn't add much to the picture.  Lovely Diane Baker (Journey to the Center of the Earth, Strait-Jacket) is entrancing as the lady of the hour.

I had been looking for it on laser disc but could never find it.  Like one of the other reviewers, I also saw this movie in the theaters as a  child and loved it.  Of course, I will see if it is as I remember.  The  giant tidal wave that covers Java is a most memorable scene.  This film  should be mandatory viewing for volcanologists since this eruption is the  largest in recorded history.",954979200,,549,4.356435643564357

948743,2,6305004218,"I immediately purchased this DVD title because it is the very first movie I remember watching at a theater as a very small child!  The theater was  the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd. in 1969-1972 Hollywood, (they re-released  it a few times, I saw it 5 times at that theater).  This DVD simply put, is  bad!  Even on a big screen TV the picture is squashed, the sound is  muffled, the theater experience is lost.  The editing seems to have been  done with scissors and tape.  Entire scenes are missing, or cut very short.  However, the best parts of the movie that I remember from when I was four  years old are ok.  The volcano eruption scenes, tidal wave, and really cool  lava piercing the ship!  That's the stuff you remember for a lifetime.",941414400,,744,4.447761194029851
948744,2,6305004218,"For some reason I've always enjoyed Krakatoa having originally seen it in Cinerama.
This DVD is frankly a disaster; many years ago Benny Hill did a sketch of a movie set on a boat that kept jumping.  This is what the print  on this DVD does all the time.  Whereas Benny Hill was funny, this is  not.
The picture is weird to say the least; it is billed as Widescreen on  the box but even when playing it in Widescreen on a Widescreen TV the  picture is too squashed.
The sound is not AC3 stereo although I thought  it was clear.
The film has been cut terribly and runs far short of the  time billed on the DVD case.
Don't bother with this awful print; let's  hope the movie gets restored properly.",925603200,,696,4.212121212121212

7880593,3,6305004218,"BOTTOM LINE: Harmless, family-friendly big budget disaster film with just enough danger & devastation sprinkled throughout to hopefully keep you from nodding off during the soapy operatic stretches in-between. A strapping young Maximilian Schell and a grizzled self-loathing turn by Brian Keith make this one worth watching. The rest of the cast & the damsels in distress... not so much. Fine practical F/X footage from that sadly bygone era when detailed miniatures & optical slights of hand were the rule of the day. Not great, not bad. I give this volcanic variant of The Poseidon Adventure a modest but honest 3 STARS.

THOUGHTS: If you've ever seen any of the myriad of star-studded disaster films that flooded theaters in the 1970's, then you'll have this potboiler plotted from start-to-finish before the opening credits are over with. Lots of melodramatic shenanigans pad out the film until we finally get to the big whoopteedo at the climax, wherein the infamous volcano on the South Seas island of Krakatoa blows its fiery top. The meager C-level roster of stars gives it their best shot, but whether you'll care one way or the other will depend on how big a fan you are of any of the cast, and/or the genre in general. This one's inoffensive enough, and at least it's no where near as hammy as, say, METEOR or AVALANCHE. But then again, these flicks are all pretty interchangeable. It's figuring who's gonna get it (and how) that makes 'em fun to watch.

THE BLU-RAY: A respectable though minimalist effort from Kino-Lorber. The transfer is mostly clean, with a smattering of dirt & debris, mostly confined to the opening title sequence. Little in the way of crush, artifacting, pixelation or edge enhancement, and thankfully no overuse of DNR! The film's audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. Nothing in the way of extras, save a handful of theatrical trailers for other, similarly-themed titles in the KL library. The movie's busy but gorgeous poster art, courtesy of the legendary Frank McCarthy, is nicely reproduced as a splashy background for the disc's main menu screen.",1512432000,,2100,4.963068181818182

7880595,3,6305004218,"I seemed to have remembered this movie differently. I seemed to have remembered that the explosion of the volcano was the main event but well memory dims over time. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes for the volcano to go all Krakatoa-ey, the rest was all story and not really any great story either, lots of internal problems like a diver who has lung issues, like the girl who loved the captain and like a bunch of convicts hitching a ride to a prison island on the other side of Krakatoa. All of these back stories just made for some really plodding stories. The acting was fairly good especially Maximillian Schell and others with only one really bad turn rendered by Diane Baker. Would I recommend it? maybe just for the old times sake.",1506643200,,736,4.45925925925926

I am disappointed with it because it is not the roadshow version (i.e., from a 70mm 6-channel stereo sound print).  The picture looks okay (in 35mm anamorphic aspect ratio) but the sound is mono.  Be aware of this if you're wanting the best version of this film (i.e., the roadshow version with stereo sound).  I am giving this disc three stars only because the picture looks okay.",1506211200,,478,4.710843373493976
7880598,4,6305004218,"I caught this in theaters as a kid with my family. A lot has been written about the title being that correct (by the time they realized it, they had printed in all of the publicity material and already added the title to the film. Rather than redo it, they just went with it since, for most folks, geography didn't matter and it is, after all, not based by on fact beyond the fact that Krakatoa DID erupt). The visuals are a few steps above what was often done at the time for these epics because the film was shot in Super Panavision 70 (65mm and presented in Cinerama and Todd AO) and exhibited in some areas in the larger format. Because of the higher resolution of the format, the larger the miniatures had to be built for the additional visible detail. This film is largely about the destruction that occurs around our heroes but the script by Cliff Gould and. Bernard Gordon (a blacklisted writer in the 50's who also wrote the scripts for ""The Day of The Triffids"" and ""55 Days at Peking"") does give us enough characterization to root for the victims and heroes of the film.

Headlined by Brian Keith, Sal Mineo, Maximilian Schell, Diane Baker and Geoffrey Holder (""Live and Let Die"") and directed by TV veteran Bernard Kowalski (who also directed a number of low budget features such as ""Attack of The Giant Leeches""), the film gene fits from a well written script and the location shooting as well. Many folks refer to ""Krakatoa"" as a guilty pleasure but I honestly don't feel any guilt enjoying this 60's epic disaster. The real star, as noted, are the visual effects by  Eugne Louri (who also worked as a director of visual effects films such as Ray Harryhausen's ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"").

Kino's release licensed from Disney is impressive on Blu-ray even if this isn't the perfect transfer to for home video. This version was not source from the 65The original roadshow version featured a six track soundtrack (which would work well on a 5.1 or 7.1 system). Unfortunately, only the mono (used for smaller theaters) soundtrack is available for this release. If this were a higher profile picture, there might have been more time spent on finding the original al multi-track elements. The mono audio presentation doesn't match the fireworks on the screen and  it doesn't even begin to hint at the impact this had in 1968 in theaters. Likewise, the film, while it looks pretty good with nice detail, is also sourced from a 35mm version of the film. Nevertheless, depth is pretty good here and colors look quite nice.

The story also suffers from a certain haphazard construction primarily due to the fact that over a half hour was trimmed from the film prior to release as I recall.

It's a pity we don't get a commentary track or any vintage featurettes on the film. Extras only include five trailers.

As far as disaster movies to, ""Krakatoa"" still looks impressive. While some of the visual effects (such as the blue screen work) doe t quite hold up, other parts involving the ships and explosions still look pretty darn good.

To close let's hear it from that esteemed critic Groucho Marx: ""Well, Art is Art, isn't it? Still, on the other hand, water is water. And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now you tell me what you know.""

I know this is a fun film and looks pretty good!",1505174400,,3408,4.601317957166392
