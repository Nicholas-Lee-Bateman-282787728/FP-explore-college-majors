4255226,3,B0043CT976,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift. I received this package on time and in what I initally thought was in good shape. After the gift was opened and upon further review, the case was cracked behind the cover and a hindge was broken off inside for to hold the DVDs. The DVDs themselves were in good condition both functionally and asthetically. It's just a bit disapointing for a gift that the case is broken beyond repair.",1324944000,,425,4.461538461538462
4255227,5,B0043CT976,"This show seems to get better every season!! i first watched it only because my girlfriend wouldn't stop talking about it. I finally gave in and sat down with her and i was hooked! starting in the middle of season two made things a little difficult to understand at first, with all the characters and different issues they each have and such but it had an instant connection to you the viewer. I think thats what makes this such a great show to watch the fact that its based in reality, in other words theres nothing fake or staged (besides the real actors/actresses them selfs) about it. there's real issues this characters deal with that real teens and even mature adults deal with all the time in real life. you can even probably learn a thing or two by just watching them. I'd recommend this show to any teenager or adult to watch as it lets us all know were not alone when going through tuff times. The actors and actresses all have amazingly put on a fantastic performance which really brings everything to a ""real world"" kind of feel which makes you feel like your in there shoes and going through what they're going through so if you haven't seen any of these check them out if there in the middle just give them a chance you may find your new favorite show. This show has become one of my most watched TV shows on television now, BUY THEM  Amazon has these at a great price!!!",1319500800,5,1385,4.389105058365759
4255228,5,B0043CT976,"i have all the seasons of secret life, i have been watching secret life since the day it first came out. this show is absolutely my favorite i hope they make more seasons",1309824000,,170,4.181818181818182
4255229,5,B0043CT976,Very happy with dvd and price. Item came way ahead of delivery date. I enjoy this series.. parents should watch this with kids.. not all kids talk about sex so openly like in the show... BUT THEY DO THINK IT.. watch it with or without your kids.. be aware of the language kids use.. This show  does not glamerize teen pregnancy and it tackels tought topics. I reccamend you give this show a try,1303084800,7,394,4.324324324324325
4255230,2,B0043CT976,When the show first came out it was so bad. It pretty much served as a really long public service announcement. Now the show has gotten ridiculous!! This person is having sex with this person. The younger sister is trying to hook up with the father of her nephew. The boy who was supposedly so in love with Amy got another girl pregnant!! I mean come on. So now the show is pretty much saying that getting pregnant at 16 isn't so bad. Granted not the worst thing that could happen but 16 is too young to become a parent in my opinion. The show needs to make its point and be done with it.,1301529600,3,588,4.121739130434783
4255231,4,B0043CT976,"I have always loved this show since Day 1!!  So, it was a no-brainer when it came to buying the next available season. It has a great cast, great stories. I mean whats not to like and surprisingly the series is directed by an old tv favorite of mine, none other than ""Potsie"" himself Anson Williams. Not too mention it has Molly Ringwald!! enuff said, lol. I also do Love Mark Derwin from my all time favorite Soap Opera One Life to Live!! I love this show period!!!",1297296000,3,466,4.295454545454546
4255252,2,B0043CT976,This season is just bad! It was a struggle to watch. Ben is so annoying anymore. The best part of the show is most definitely Ricky and seeing what a great father and overall person he has become.,1450224000,,196,4.184210526315789
