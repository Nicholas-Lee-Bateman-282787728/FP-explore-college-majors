let along Destroy it - and I wish I Never even saw this movie - no matter Who is in it.!! : (
And - this movie has a feeling that the writers - did a Poor job scripting this movie. I'm sure it could have been
written better - to match the talent of these 2 comedy legends. The thing with the police & the bees almost made me smile - but
I was ready for Sharper more clever humor.
At the end - with Chris sitting in the sailboat talking to his deceased father - is ironic and paradoxical - in that we all miss Chris.

It is the different obstacles and comedic approaches and end results that make this a classic. Chris Farley is great in this movie, and is a awesome physical comic.

So, stop reading this short review, and buy this dvd !",1475798400,,419,4.358974358974359
705319,5,6303610811,"The year 1995 birthed an iconic, instant comedy classic for the film industry with the release of Tommy Boy. Peter Segal orchestrated a film that appeals to the American people and uses comedy to bring the audience together, no matter their age. It demonstrates how best friends act with each other and the sarcasm, wittiness, and the teasing that comes with a great friendship. This production is a perfect example of how comedy can be used to its greatest potential while also keeping a realistic and serious plot. Tommy Boy is a classic comedy for a reason, it combines all the elements of a great relationship between friends and exemplifies what true friendship is all about.
Tommy Boy Callahan (Chris Farley) and Richard Hayden (David Spade) are sent on a road trip across the Midwest for a last ditch effort to sell Callahan Auto Parts, Tommy Boys recently deceased fathers company, new brake pads in order to keep the company from being bought out. Given that it took Tommy seven years to graduate from college, no one took him seriously so he had something to prove on the sales trip. The sales trip captures the true essence of how road trips usually go, terrible, and encompasses the growth of Tommy Boy as a salesman while shedding light on the unusual techniques that are used until he succeeds. The relationship between Richard and Tommy is very relatable and pokes fun at all the heckling that goes along with being good friends, and that is inevitably entertaining.
Chris Farley (Tommy Boy), with his jolting and surprising movements, and David Spade (Richard), who uses sarcasm and wit to his utmost advantage, make an unamusing plot on paper into a hilarious comedy on screen. Chris Farleys ability to make people laugh by the actions he expresses is unprecedented, and combined with his booming voice and comedic tone, make the film second to none. David Spade, even though he is side by side with one of the funniest men to ever live, is not outshined and his constant jokes, with precise delivery, towards his co-star add to the already hysterical film. This dynamic duo worked so well together that it seemed like this friendship between them was like any other great relationship someone shares with their best friend, creating a further connection with the audience.
The screenplay is full of wit and sarcasm, as in Did you eat paint chips as a kid? and Does this suit make me look fat?, which Richard responds No, your face does.. It is the little comments throughout the entire movie that keeps the film from having any dull moments and always has you laughing. The word retard is used multiple times throughout the film, which can be distasteful to some audiences; however, this does not take away from the overall comedic effect of the film because the lines surrounding this choice word are so well-spoken. The script was executed with great precision by the actors along with a well written script, which makes this film incomparable. The script conveys a realistic relationship between friends by using punch lines and tantalizing jokes that go along with being best buddies with one another.
The chemistry between Chris Farley (Tommy) and David Spade (Richard) is uncanny yet it represents the bonds many people have with their closest friends which allows the audience to have an immediate connection with this humorous film. The film gives off a feeling of youthfulness and brings about the (sometimes childish) humor we all possess. True friendships are full of laughs, embarrassing yourself, having a good time, and being there for each other and this film incorporates them all; that is what makes Tommy Boy an American classic.",1475539200,,3665,4.903381642512077
705320,3,6303610811,"When I first rented this back in 1995 it caught me and my brother off guard.  We both couldn't stop laughing at it, but that was then and this is now.  I do still like it but it didn't age well enough to make it as awesome as it did when I first saw it.  The features in this a very good and its worth buying.",1474243200,,309,3.6515151515151514

705424,3,6303610811,"I hadn't seen this one when it came out back in 1995, but had heard it mentioned in popular culture and seen merchandise like the die-cast car of Spade' s character in shops so I thought I'd check it out.  Chris Farley plays a kind to everyone but not very bright young man who has somehow with a D+, graduated from college after seven years.  His father obviously loves him though and luckily for him his father is the main employer in their small Ohio town so Tommy's future is pretty secure in his father's business, which manufactures car parts.  No one else at the business has much faith in Tommy and David Spade's character, a former nerdy kid who grew up resenting Tommy's easy coasting by life, has become Tommy's father's right hand man, and dislikes Tommy more than any of them, but has to hold back and accommodate him.  However Tommy's father has just married a much younger woman and borrowed a heap of money to manufacture new break pads.  A tragedy occurs and it looks like the factory is going to have to be sold leaving everyone unemployed, however Tommy being the kind guy that he is offers to put up his inheritance as collateral for a few weeks extended loan while he tries to sell those break pads on a road trip.  Of course Spade's character being the one who knows about the business must accompany him on the trip.

Spade usually plays the same character in movies, and although there's still some similarities with this Richard one, he is a lot less womanising (although there is still one scene at a motel) and more of a straight up, nerdy guy than the social loser norm.  I found this refreshing.  A lot of the movie is predictable, but there's still laughs to be had along the way.  I thought Rob Lowe's character wasn't used enough, when we first see him he throws his rubbish into a pram and I thought he's gong to be an excellent villain, but he's only in a few scenes.  Likewise Dan Aykroyd I would have liked to have seen more of.

Tommy Boy for me didn't quite live up to it's hype, perhaps it's because Farley passed away not long after making this or it reminds people of their youth in the mid nineties that this has achieved that pop culture significant status.  You still should check it out though!",1468108800,,2239,4.444987775061125

705921,4,6303610811,"The 1995 comedic twisteroo of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" TOMMY BOY (1995) is a surprising 7.0 at IMDb.

It stars Chris Farley and David Spade, in a buddy road film where dimbulb Tommy Callahan Jr. and faithful Richard Hayden are on a mission to save Tommy's Sandusky, OH. auto parts factory, by convincing parts houses to stock his revolutionary new brake pads. All this after the chubby Callahan's dad (Brian Dennehy) suddenly passes away at his own wedding reception.

Opposing his potential success is Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akyroyd) owner of a rival auto parts outfit.
Also hoping to see Tommy fail are his stepmom (Bo Derek) and stepbrother (an uncredited Rob Lowe).
But what's this? Beverly and Paul are seen kissing? Hmmmm....

This decent comedy was produced by Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels.
SNL cast members Farley and Spade were also close friends.

Brain Dennehy and Chris Farley really do make a perfect father-son match; almost makes you wonder whether they might have been related. The Bo Derek cameo was kind of startling. The great Dan Ackroyd appears only near the end, and I felt that he was very underutilized. Farley is amazing at physical comedy and really a pretty extraordinary actor, but too much of the time I was thinking ""this movie is a Chris Farley vehicle"" rather than ""this is Chris Farley doing a great job playing a part"". The movie did strive for a sense of rustbelt authenticity and it could have completely succeeded at that had they downplayed Farley's occasional excesses and schtik-fulness. His non-schtik abilities were formidable enough that the excesses were unnecessary. There is great chemistry between Farley and Spade.",1419897600,,936,5.006410256410256

707067,5,6303610811,"This is not a great film, but it accomplishes 100% of its stated goal of being funny, heart-warming, and just a break from our fast paced society.
The film features Chris Farley as an overweight and undereducated son of a factory owner(Brian Denehy) who marries that final trophy wife(Bo Derek) before having a heart attack.  Farley is thrust into running the plant.  He has to go on the road for sales and this becomes a road show a la Bob Hope.  The fun ensues and you identify with the guys, the cheap motels, the cavalcade of sales calls, etc.  On the way to Chicago, their car is torn asunder as are they.  By the time they meet with the big owner who they have to impress(Dan Akroyd), they're totally wasted.  What follows is the high point of the film and truly crazy fun.  Rob Lowe is great as the con man(secretly married to bride Bo Derek) who's at the center of all of Chris Farley's problems.  David Spade is great as the straight man for Farley's act and elevates this from just a formulaic comedy to a wonderful step up from the usual...",1417219200,,1051,4.409326424870466

Predictable.  Slap stick.  Entirely built around Spade and Farley.  Plenty of hilarious moments, although I could do without Farley running into everything and falling down every 3 or 4 minutes.

708340,5,6303610811,"There are so many comedies out there and such little quality. Fortunately Tommy Boy doesn't place under this category. The main character Tommy was taking bong hits and barley passing classes with a meager D+ in college. Needless to say he was  skimming past in life without a worry until the unfortunate happening of the passing of his father. But after his death, Tommy finds himself alone in the world in addition with his responsibility of the family business and the unknowing scam of his father's second marriage. His wife and son wind up being con artists who attempt to and ruin Tommy's adventure to save the business. The combination of all problems in his life and his lack of finesse, allow you to let lose and laugh at another's problems. Who couldn't enjoy Chris Farley wearing a tiny jacket singing ""fat man in a little coat""? Or the progression of their car along the way. First looking untouched, when afterwards having a fence as a door and a tarp as a roof?

No, it isn't the best comedy out there, but it is one of the funniest, if that makes much sense.  It is also universally regarded as one of the funniest, a slapstick classic in the sense that it is one of the most quotable and visually memorable films of the 90s.  Everyone has seen it, everyone quotes it, everyone acts out the scenes and everyone laughs whenever the name is mentioned because they get those mental images of deer or Farley in a small jacket (my best friend acts out that scene almost every time we are together) and it just brings a smile to your face.

It is also Farley's best work and something he wanted to get back to before he died. At least we have this. It rises above your normal comedy to be something else because the script is well thought out for the most part and it allows these guys just to really show us into their lives, while presenting a heartwarming story about saving an autoplant.

Tommy, who is not playing with a full deck, makes every misstep along the way as he tries to convince auto parts dealers to buy the new and revolutionary Callahan brake pads. Somehow or other, Tommy hits upon a technique that really works, and by the time he and Richard are at the end of their road trip throughout the Midwest, the orders have started to flood into the office. Unfortunately, Callahan's competitor has a plant in the Callahan offices (Bo Derek and Rob Lowe posing as a mother-son team) that almost destroys all of Tommy's and Richard's efforts.

709504,5,6303610811,"Look, for a Lorne Michaels movie, this is about as good as it gets.  Lorne has a pretty poor record of putting out genuinely funny movies by SNL alumni; yes, there are some good ones, but when you have wade through stuff like ""It's Pat"", ""Superstar"", ""The Ladies Man"", and ""Coneheads"" it becomes apparent that Lorne will put out anything from an SNL alum as long as the script clocks in at around 90 minutes.

Chris Farley also had a really bad record with leading roles: ""Black Sheep"" (basically another attempt to recreate the Spade/Farley chemistry onscreen) and ""Beverly Hills Ninja"" are both hideously unfunny and were clearly just cash-in attempts.

So ""Tommy Boy"" is surprising in the sense that it's funny...really funny.  And the humor holds up almost twenty years after its production.  The lines are quotable almost at a ""Caddyshack"" level.

I'm not even going to give a plot summary because...well, who cares?  If you want 90 minutes of stupid laughs and funny bits then this is the flick for you.

Is this five-stars like ""Yojimbo"" or ""The Bicycle Thief""?  Hell no.  Is this five-stars like ""Hey, I just got a six pack and I want to laugh,""?

709987,5,6303610811,"Recently watched movie review:
*Tommy Boy (1995)- 4.5/5

Tommy Boy is a classic comedy for 'Chris Farley' fans. Sure, the movie is very stupid, but everything about it seems very sweet and innocent. Tommy (Chris Farley) graduates from college with a D+, and he's proud of it. He goes to visit his dad, Big Tom (Brian Dennehy), who gives him an executive job at Callahan Auto. Big Tom is getting married, and Tommy finds out he's going to have a brother. Well, Big Tom dies at the wedding, and Callahan Auto and its other executives are left with a big decision as the company has no money. Tommy stands up and declares it's his turn to finally step up and sell some brake pads to help keep the company afloat. There's just one problem, he doesn't know how to sell, so he brings along his best friend, Richard (David Spade), who also works at Callahan Auto and knows everything about brake pads. While on the road, Tommy and Richard get into mischief, while finding outsomeoneis trying to sell the Callahan brand to a different company.

If you don't know 'Chris Farley' and his comedy, it's pretty much all physical comedy. Let's not forget about David Spade, he doesn't do physical comedy, but his comedy is more based on one-liners and facial expressions. Tommy Boy is not the best movie you'll see, but if know what you're getting into, than there isn't much to complain about. Critics don't care much for it, but physical comedy audiences who have seen it, mostly love it, and consider it a 'Chris Farley' classic. It's funny, it's stupid, and it stars Chris Farley and David Spade, so what's not to like? Overall, Tommy Boy gets a highly recommended 'rent.'

PS- RIP Chris Farley.",1353628800,,1685,4.647651006711409

Even though I watch on a wide-screen monitor, it evidentally isn't wide enough; the frame view (along the horizontal, even with a 1920 x 1080 resolution) is all crammed together, making the film (along the verticle) appear stretched and drawn.

710208,3,6303610811,"Tommy Boy(released Mar/95),stars SNL actors David Spade and Chris Farley in their first and best movie together. Chris Farley is at least given somewhat of a decent plot to work with and,unlike Black Sheep,Spade wasn't comedically emasculated and his acerbic wit and sarcasm are left intact and make a good counterpoint to Farley's character of a man-child.
The plot involves the Callahan family. Tommy(Farley)graduates college,finally after seven years(!),and returns home to Sandusky to his father's car parts business. His father Tom Sr.(Brian Dennehy) welcomes the newly graduated Tommy home with open arms and gives him an office position right away. Tom Sr.has been widowed for some time and he decides to get married to one Beverley Burns(Bo Derek),who has a ""son"" Paul(Rob Lowe).At the wedding reception Tom Sr.takes a heart attack and passes away leaving the entire business to Beverley. But the business needs a loan it can't get and the only hope the firm has of staying afloat is for Tommy to hit the road to try and sell their new line of quality brake pads. With the aid of Tom Sr.'s former assistant Richard(Spade)they travel the open roads but get no where fast,due to Tommy's inexperience and Richards lack of delivery. Finally through perseverance the pair come up with a winning strategy and the orders start coming in. Eventually they compile enough to virtually save the company.
Things are looking good for Callahan auto parts but a wrench is thrown into things in the form of Beverley's son Paul. He changes the computer records and out going shipments get all fouled up and the customers are cancelling orders. In the meantime both Richard and the former receiver/shipper have seen Paul and Beverley kissing in a very non-motherly/son way. It is found out they are husband and wife. Into the mix comes Ray Zalinsky(Dan Akroyd),the auto parts ""king"" out of Chicago,who offers to buy up Callahan. At the takeover board meeting Tommy and Richard come in in a very unconventional manner and force Ray to listen to what's been going on;such as the changing of their records and the fact Beverley is married to Paul which makes the marriage to Tommy's father illegal. Callahan's actually belongs to Tommy  now and he isn't selling it to Ray. But he does manage to finagle an order for an astounding 500,000 brake pads out of him. The company is saved.
The film has lots of Farley-esque touches like his ""holy schnike"" line(pronounced like Nike,the shoe),his ""for the love of Gawwwd"" line,his hyperactive gesturing and his getting so mad it looks like every blood vessel in his body will burst. Spade of course is in fine form with his dry humour and rolling but slit eyes at Farley's faux pauxs. The story is one you can get behind even though it's as see through as tissue paper. There are some laughable moments here and there like the deer in the car and the slow but steady trashing of Spade's 60s car/baby. Michaels,the creator of SNL,goes back to his old stomping grounds and filmed this one in and around the Toronto area. The Gooderham and Worts Distillery there is the home of Callahan's auto parts.
Technically this film looks good and is clear and crisp. It is in its w/s a/r and there are two DVDs. Extras include:four featurettes,6 deleted scenes,8 alternate takes,15 extended scenes,a gag reel,the trailer and more.
All in all a reasonably good film from the Farley/Spade duo. The plot is simple but the stars make the most of their screen time. Brian Dennehy is very good as Tommy Sr. and Dan Ackroyd makes a nice surprise visit as Ray the auto parts king. For fans of this film,this edition is certainly all the schnike you can get!",1318204800,,3666,4.84688995215311

Chris Farley plays the son of an expert auto parts salesman,whos passing leaves the family business in jeopardy of being sold. Farley suits up with his number crunching friend (David Spade) and together they set out across the country to sell enough brakepads to save the day,what follows is pure comedic genius. From a college triumph to an unforgettable plane ride,and from highway hijinks to one hilarious sales pitch after another,this film is undoubtedly Farley's greatest work and a comedy masterpiece. Having been practically raised on this movie,I can honestly say that it has brought years of laughter for me and my family and that I highly recommend this film. Though the big guy is not with us anymore,he still lives on in this brilliant film which I hope will bring just as much joy to your home as it has in mine.",1221177600,2,894,4.737179487179487
710323,5,6303610811,"This film is Chris Farley at the absolute top of his game. There are so many classic scenes in this film that it's too long to list. Notably hilarious are the ""burning model car"" and the ""guarantee fairy"" scenes. One can't help but laugh out loud at these scenes every time (I start laughing even before they start now!)

The team of Farley and Spade never worked better than in this film. Richard's (Spade) biting sarcasm plays perfectly to Tommy's (Farley) ""buffoon with a heart of gold"" (a character practically patented by Farley). Also wonderful are Brian Dennehy as Tommy's dad, Rob Lowe (in an inexplicably uncredited performance) as Tommy's scheming stepbrother, and the always professional Dan Ackroyd as auto parts czar Ray Zalinsky.

710324,4,6303610811,"Don't know what the title means? See this movie and you'll know all too well what I'm talking about. Unfortunately for myself I have not been well acquainted with the comedic extraordinaire who was Chris Farley (may you rest in peace big guy) outside of ""best of"" episodes for SNL. Equally fortunate for me though, I have a friend who, upon hearing that I've never seen Tommy Boy, decided not to rest until I have enjoyed this gem of a film. I was a little skeptical, after all this is the guy who on three occasions has nearly ended my short, yet fun, life. No need to be skeptical my friends, Tommy Boy is one hell of a comedy which stands toe to toe with any of the great comedies of the past or present.

Tommy Callahan is the son of a wealthy and respected auto sells man who has, unfortunately, punched his last ticket, as they say. With his families auto parts factory needing money in the worst way, Tommy (Farley) and Richard (David Spade), his childhood friend, set out on a road trip on which they will destroy Spades car (come on, must we always destroy the nice expensive car of the guy who obsesses over it?), kill a deer, see said dead deer come back to life and destroy the car some more, and beat each other senseless.

Like another great movie I recently saw, Juno, Tommy Boy is full of hilarious quotes and one liners (such as the one which I chose to be my title). The acting from all cast members is great, especially from Spade and Farley who truly make this movie great. Kudos to all involved in the making of this film. Although it wasn't the perfect comedy, it was sure as hell close. 4.5/5.

710406,4,6303610811,Tommy Boy stars the late Chris Farley at his comedic finest with David Spade. He plays bumbling fratboy Tommy Callahan whose world is turned upside down when his father remarries and suddenly dies. Hilarity ensues when it is up to Tommy to save the company (which makes auto parts) and therefore the town. There are some classic one-liners and Farley was pretty agile for a big guy (the scene in the airplane bathroom is hilarious). Julie Warner is very likable as the small-town girl and Rob Lowe plays a weasel. Totally a hilarious movie without resorting to a lot of bathroom humor.,1205971200,3,585,4.745098039215686

Hilarious comedy that has became a cable favorite over the years and a cult favorite! It's become Chris Farley's big breakthrough after making appearences in such movies like ""Airheads!"", ""Coneheads"", and ""Billy Madison"", David Spade is funny as the weassley business worker who becomes either a friend or foe to Farley's character. Thus it makes a likable duo like Laural and Hardy or Cheech & Chong, this is a great comedy that i recommend if you love the genre.

710511,5,6303610811,"Although ""Black Sheep"" is a funnier movie, in that it has more vintage Farley/Spade humor, this film has a better-written story-line, at least I think so. But the two films are VERY similar, in premise and script. The Farley-Spade chemistry is evident throughout; Spade's dark, caustic wit, played off of Farley's over-the-top performance, is a non-stop journey through a story which, although a little hard to believe in spots, is a little uplifting. The sadness over the death of the father (Brian Dennehy) gives the story a serious tone, and the final scene, with Farley's character, sitting in his sailboat, talking to the wind, telling his father how much he'll be missed, shows him as a sensitive, albeit immature, man who really loved his father, and wants to make him proud.

Jokes from Farley about Spade, and vice versa, are first-rate, but the two funniest moments in the film are probably when Farley's character is trying to sell a business owner some brake pads, and re-enacts a car accident with model cars from the business owner's desk. He's trying to show him what could happen with ""the other guy's brake pads."" This is classic, vintage Farley, and a far more subtle moment, but really hilarious, would be after Spade's and Farley's character actually have a physical confrontation. Richard (Spade) finally crashes a plank of wood across Tommy's (Farley's) face, knocking him unconscious. The next scene has them sitting in a restaurant, staring at one another, not speaking, and the soundtrack is playing ""...I'm sorry, so sorry..."" That is the trick to enjoying any good movie; paying close attention to the quieter moments. They always have more content than the more visible, noisy parts. Often, something important is lost on an audience, because in a slower, less involved scene, that's when someone has to go to the bathroom, or get something to drink. This has ruined the enjoyment of many a movie, in the theater, as well as the home, for me, at least, and I am sure I speak for lots of movie fans by saying this. Get your stuff, and pee BEFORE the movie begins!

But, in all, Tommy Boy is one of those comedies that will leave you laughing long after the movie ends.",1159833600,6,2195,4.835106382978723
710512,4,6303610811,"There are so many funny moments in this movie by the end you will still be laughing about them all. I first saw this movie when I was ten. I only understood the slapstick humor. When I watched it again when I was thirteen it was triple the hilarity!

 Here's some example's of really funny golden Farley moments:

1) Chris(Tommy Calahan) flopping down on a coffee table.

2) Chris backing up in Richard's(David Spade) car and messing up the door.

3) The classic ""Fat guy in a little coat, fat guy in-a-little coat""

4) The deer destroying Richard's car.

5) Chris and his step-brother going cow tipping

Plus there are numerous one liner fat jokes delivered from David Spade. If you have never had the oppurtunity to see this work of art, get ready to give meaning to your life! Ok, that might have been exagerated a bit, but I all-out recomend this movie.

It sure is sad that Farley couldn't have gotten the chance to make more movies. I bet he would've grown to make more in-depth films like his bud Sandler has recently done.

Chris Farley goes all out, as he always did, with his physical comedy - while David Spade stuck to his guns as the sly, sarcastic character who prefers picking people apart with his commentary.  They compliment each other very well and their interplay is hilarious throughout the movie.

There is nothing amazing about the story, but there is something about the way it's done that will win you over.  There are countless lines in this movie that have lived on and been quoted over the years...

The ""Holy Shnike"" Edition comes with tons of extras on a bonus disc (and at Best Buy, you also get a really cool Tommy Callahan bobble-head doll as part of an exclusive offer).  There is some really excellent behind-the-scenes footage on the bonus disc that gives you more insight into the comic pairing of Farley and Spade, as well as a look at the life of Chris Farley. Great material.

Highly recommended!",1144800000,11,1350,4.662447257383966

David Spade and Chris Farley are perhaps one of the best comedy duos of all time. The film is basically about a young man named Tommy Shalahan(Chris Farley) that comes home from college to work at his father's auto parts company. Upon his arrival, Tommy learns that his father has just gotten married. However, his father dies at the wedding reception, so Tommy is forced to sell some of the company's products or risk going under. Along with Richard (David Spade), the two of them set out on an adventure of a lifetime full of comedy and entertainment for the entire family to enjoy. I do admit the supporting characters are stereotyped and the film falls under a lot of cliches, but it's still funny. Overall, I highly recommend this one.

710692,5,6303610811,"Like John Belushi, Chris Farley was a talent that just burned out way too quickly.  Tommy boy is arguably Farley's best film as he's paired with his partner David Spade.  Farley plays Tommy Callahan, the son of Big Tom Callahan who owns a brake parts factory in Ohio.  Big Tom dies on his wedding day as he marries Beverly played by Bo Derek.  Tommy thinks he's got a new brother in Paul (played uncredited by Rob Lowe) but paul and Beverly are really man & wife who planned on bilking Tom out of his money before he died.

In order to save the factory, Tommy has to go on the road and try to sell the companies new brake pads.  Richared (spade) accompanies Tommy since he's an expert on Brake Pads.  The picture becomes a buddy road picture similar to Planes, Trains, and Autmobiles with the slobbish Tommy constantly annoying the snobbish and anal-retentive Richard at every turn.  Farley's brand of physical comedy is on prime display as, like Belushi, he was extremely graceful for a man of his size.  As the pair do what they can to save the factory, Paul is back at home doing everything he can to make sure they fail including screwing up the shipping orders.

The hilarious scenes are too many to mention but the apparent dead deer who comes back to life and destroys Richard's vintage car is certainly a highlight as is Richard getting caught literally with his pants down by Tommy as he leers at a beautiful skinny dipper.  Is Richard's favorite little Rascal Spanky???

710694,4,6303610811,"While I haven't been the biggest fan of the ""Saturday Night Live"" or the ""Second City"" Comedy group, one cannot deny that these groups have spurned some of the biggest comedic movie stars over the past 25 years.  One such actor who emerged in the mid 1990s and appeared to be on his way to superstardom was Chris Farley.  Unfortunately Farley would pass away in 1997 due to a drug overdose.  This was really a shame because we might not have really seen how great Chris Farley was to become.  About two years before his death, Farley would take on what was soon to become his signature role - 1995's ""Tommy Boy"".  This is a movie that might have been an average movie at best - but thanks to Farley's presence, he gives this movie an edge to rank it as an all-time classic comedy.

It is also worth noting that another ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus teams up with Farley in this movie - that person is David Spade.  Farley and Spade had worked together on other movies (""Black Sheep"", ""Coneheads"").  The chemistry between has always been good - but perhaps the chemistry was never better than in ""Tommy Boy"".  As often the case, Farley being cast as the overweight, bumbling - but loveable guy teamed up with Spade's Up-tight and straight-laced guy.  The combination gelled so well.  It is a shame that Farley didn't live past the age of 33, because the team of Farley and Spade could have ranked up there historically as one of the great comedy pairings of all-time - and possibly could have become the greatest comedy pairing in recent years.

""Tommy Boy"" is no exception to the typical typecasting of Farley and Spade.  Chris Farley played Thomas ""Tommy"" Callahan III (or called by his father ""Tommy Boy"").  Farley plays the overweight, dim-witted and bumbling heir to his father's auto parts company - Callahan Auto Parts.  Tommy returns from just barely graduating college and is going to work for his father.  Tommy's father ""Big Tom"" is played brilliantly by Brian Deheny.  It is amazing the resemblance between Farley and Deheny.  Tommy's childhood friend - the uptight Richard Hayden (played by David Spade) works for Big Tom as his right-hand man and he is assigned to teach Tommy the ropes.  At the same time, Tommy's father announces his engagement to Beverly Burns (played by Bo Derek).  Tommy also learns in addition to getting a new stepmother, he will be getting a stepbrother, Paul - played by Rob Lowe.  What soon happens is that the company gets into some financial trouble and becomes ripe for a takeover from a nationwide auto parts dealer, Ray Zalinsky (played by Dan Aykroyd in his typical straight-laced ""Joe Friday"" style).  Tommy and Richard soon must embark on a road trip throughout the Midwest to build demand for their auto parts - or else lose the company.

Farley and Spade are truly going to give this movie the edge.  This is the best example of where the bumbling overweight/up-tight, straight-laced combination works.  Farley is truly going to do a tremendous job with the physical comedy.  His bumbling character is going to make him prone to some terrific moments.  However, don't count Spade out.  While Spade isn't going to be the centerpiece of the physical comedy - he is going to have his moments.  Even Rob Lowe provides a nice physical comedy moment toward the end of the movie - involving a crash test dummy!  One thing worth watching throughout the movie is what happens to Richard's car - definitely some classic moments.

While the physical comedy is great, the chemistry between Farley and Spade really is cemented by the dialogue throughout the movie.  The actors truly know how to play off of each other - and it works.  An example of this is in the when Tommy returns from college.  This is just one example on how Spade's uptight character responds to Farley.

Tommy: ""Did you hear I graduated?""

Richard: ""Yeah and just a shade under a decade too, all right.""

Tommy: ""You know a lot of people go to college for seven years.""

Richard: ""I know, they're called doctors.""

And here is an example of how Farley's bumbling character responds to the uptight Spade.

Richard: What did I say about eating in the car anyways?

Tommy: It's not good cause it spoils your dinner?

The road trip is truly one of the great scenes of the movie.  One of the best parts is when Tommy and Richard are arguing over radio stations.  They finally settle on a sappy song - and even start to sing along to it.  There is another scene where they are also singing along.  In addition to these scenes solidifying the bonding between Tommy and Richard, it reminds me of being with a buddy of mine - and singing along to music in the car.  Great stuff.

I also like how Tommy's character develops throughout the movie.  He goes from the irresponsible college graduate to gaining a sense of responsibility to save Callahan Auto Parts.  I really like Tommy's commitment to his hometown - recognizing how important it was to save the jobs of the people who served his father's company for so well.  I especially like the scene at the end of the movie when Tommy addresses to workers of Callahan - it seemed genuine and that Tommy really grew up.

The only disappointing performance I took was Bo Derek's character of Beverly - Tommy's stepmother.  While there is a reference to Bo's ""10"" days, I didn't think she played the role well.  Especially when we learn that Beverly is really out to rob Tommy of the company - she just didn't really see to play the villainess role very well.

Overall, this is a very funny movie.  When you watch it, you will truly realize that we lost Chris Farley and probably missed out on his best yet to come.  Highly recommended comedy.",1120521600,4,5691,4.6462925851703405
710756,4,6303610811,"Review no. 160. There's no doubt about it, actor Chris Farley left us WAY to early. Even though his role in this flick was a fat, sloppy, dim-witted, borderline 'tard, one still couldn't help from feeling bad for the poor sap. A (darn) good comedy. Things get out of control when Tommy Callahan's III (Farley) father Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy) unexpectedly dies at the reception of his own wedding while the two 'big boys' are doing a dual karaoke to the Motown hit ""What'd I Say"" (actually,it's pretty good). Tommy Boy and his former SNL colleague Richard (David Spade) tries to sell something like a half-a-million brake pads in order to save the family business, Callahan Enterprises. The two experience such outrageously hilarious situations, that I honestly think that some parents should use certain scenes in this movie to show their sons on Ridlan how NOT to act. Tommy Boy simply acts up a bit too often. Office worker Michelle (Julie Warner) sees something decent and sensitive in the big lug as the two end up spending some quality time together. Most memorable scene: when Tommy Boy tries to repeat a line of wisdom he had heard from his father, ""When I go to my butcher, I can always look up a cow's ass to see if the meat is fresh, but I'll take his word for it"".

The plotline is somewhat cliched (good vs. evil, fight-against-time sort of thing) but still different (throw in a scheming son-mother/couple and the selling of brake pads). The connection between Richard (Spade) and Tommy (Farley) is top notch. Every joke, routine, monologue, etc. is simply hilarious! I dare you to stay straight-faced!! When I first heard of this movie through previews, I figured it to be a stupid, toilet-humor ""comedy"" with bad acting. YOU CANT BE MORE WRONG! What else is there to say about this movie? The acting is seamless, the plot and adventures are hilariously done, and the humor is unbeatable. Farley even exposes a bit of emotion (albeit tied with a little humor), such as when he's on the sailboat and he's ""talking"" with his father. Not to mention the supporting cast (Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe, Bo Derek, Julie Warner)!

Here are my favorite parts:

1. When Tommy is trying to sell ""Ted"" his brake pads instead of another companies...his mannerisms are so unorthodox!! ""Next thing you know, there's money missing off the dresser and your daughter's knocked up, I seen it a hundred times.""

2. The part where Richard's god-awful toupee gets blown back by a fan. every time it kills me!

3. When Tommy has on Richard's jacket and is singing ""Fat guy in a little coat!""

4. Richard: ""Mommy, mommy, the rhino's getting too close to the car!""

5. The entire scene of when the ""dead"" deer completely dismantles Richard's car.

6. Tommy: ""You know where the weight room is? I'll check it out""

7. When Tommy and Richard are listening to the Karen Carpenter song and getting emotional.

Tommy Callahan III (Farley) is an accident-prone but good-natured goofball who after seven years in college returns to his hometown to a cushy job at his family auto supply factory. When his father Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy) dies of a heart attack, Tommy and his father's sarcastic assistant Richard (Spade) must go on the road on his father's sales trip to prevent the factory and the town from going under. ""Tommy Boy"" is a very enjoyable film tribute to the late Chris Farley's comedic talents. The onscreen chemistry between Chris Farley and David Spade is excellent. The 1995 comedy offers some hilarious moments and also stars Rob Lowe, Bo Derek and Dan Aykroyd. Though it wasn't a commercial success during its theatrical run, ""Tommy Boy"" gained much attention upon home video release and became both Farley's and Spade's best film.

""Tommy Boy"" Holy Schnike Edition is a considerable improvement over the original DVD. The Chris Farley-David Spade comedy is presented in a 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a sharp picture quality and a well balanced Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.

I couldn't help myself but laugh at a rate of about 10 laughs per minute on average. Thats how funny the movie is. David Spade and the late Chris Farley make their movie duo debut in this movie, followed by Black Sheep. Tommy (Farley), a party animal disaster driven guy teamed up with Richard (Spade), a serious business handyman go on the road trying to sell brake pads to save a company. Little do they know what hilarity (and destruction!) comes twoards them.
A deer wrecking Spades car, Cow Tipping, and a ""butcher"" line, are just the few things that make this movie one of the greatest comedies of all time. I reccomend this movie, 110%.",1074124800,3,844,4.348101265822785

His father, is in the middle of taking out a huge loan for the new brake pad division and he ends up dying at his wedding. Now Tommy is left alone to run the company which he has no idea about.

A lot of funny things go on while on the road. From lighting things in fire, killing a deer and putting it in the car, and breaking the car door. About the car, everywhere they go, the car gets more and more destroyed.

Yes, it is hysterically funny, but it also has a lot of heart; without even trying, it is a great movie about friendship and overcoming tragedy.
Of course, that's not why you should watch it.  You should watch ""Tommy Boy"" because I have seen it at least a dozen times, and yet I still end up with tears rolling down my face at least once during the movie because I'm laughing so hard.  Farley was an absolute master of physical comedy, and ""Tommy Boy"" is loaded with great slapstick.  However, it's his give and take with the supremely sarcastic David Spade that provides some of the film's funniest moments.
In addition, Bo Derek, Brian Dennehy and Rob Lowe are all great in their supporting roles.  Lowe, was particularly impressive as Tommy's sleazy step-brother; somehow he manages to play it straight the whole movie without ever being dull.  Finally, Dan Akroyd is great in his extended cameo.
If you're looking for Oscar worthy performances, or you don't appreciate physical humor, skip this one, you won't like it.  However, if you're just looking for a ridiculous romp that make you roll with laughter and leave you feeling good, this is the movie for you.

Farley is Tommy and after his father dies of a heart attack, he inherits his father's auto parts company. He also finds out that his father's business was going into bankruptcy and now it's up to Tommy and Richard (Spade) to travel across the country and sell as many of brake pads as they can so the company doesn't have to sell.
This movie is truly hilarious and I enjoyed every minute of it. One of my favorite scenes in the entire movie is when Tommy and his girlfriend are on a date on the lake and he's get heckled by some kids. And how could you not laugh at the part with the deer in the back seat?
Great movie, very funny and it never gets old. Check out TOMMY BOY and also check out some of Farley's other movies like BLACK SHEEP and BEVERLY HILLS NINJA.

Put them together and you have a damn funny movie. The only thing that is sad about this is that Tommy Boy was one of the last funny movies with SNL cast memebers, except for Black Sheep and a few Adam Sandler movies.

It's just too bad they only made two movies together (three if you count ""Coneheads"", but they weren't really together in that movie, just both in it, and that movie wasn't so great anyway), I would have liked to have seen more.  The basic story of this movie is that Farley plays Tommy Calahan, a burnout college student whose father (Brian Dennehy) owns a brake pad company.  When his father dies, Tommy must take over and try to keep the company afloat with the help of his dad's assistant (Spade), and keep his evil stepmom and her ""son"" (played by Bo Derek and Rob Lowe) from usurping the inheritance.  Through this somewhat cliched storyline, we get tons of laughs, and more than a couple of dramatic moments, proving it's not just some silly little film.  If you love to laugh, you can't get go wrong here.  I also recommend Farley and Spade's second movie, ""Black Sheep"".  It's not quite as good as this one, but still very funny.

Story centers around Tommy Boy, a not so bright lad just out of college, who follows the model of the fool archetype (this means he does stupid things and gets ridiculed) on the hero's quest (to make sure that his father's car company doesn't go out of business). David Spade is his reflection character who supplies plenty of conflict and laughs.
TOP FIVE SCENES OF TOMMY BOY:
(1) Two of them in the car singing SUPERSTAR while they cry; total sappy song but good;
(2) Spade hitting Tommy Boy character with a two by four during a fight;
(3) Robe Lowe relieving himself on a power outlet and getting a shock of his life;

(5) the things Spade said about Tommy Boy to the passengers on the plane when they're faking it as attendants. Look for it. :D

Surprisingly(at least for a movie featuring SNL regulars) it's funny more than it's not,with Farley getting most of the laughs,although Spade certainly usues his knack for one-liners to good effect. There's also a refreshing good-naturedness to the whole project. All in all, a likeable film.",985996800,,752,5.38135593220339
711243,5,6303610811,"How can I give this movie 5 stars?  While on the surface this is not a film for the ages, it is perhaps one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  Chris Farley is at the top of his game - which includes the usual pratfalls and physical comedy.  One of the strong points includes the character of ""Tommy Boy"".  An odd blend of self loathing (""I have what Dr.'s call a bit of a weight problem..I once ate a whole bear claw and got it stuck right here..), combined with a charming sense of confidence in himself.  The scenes where Chris Farley and David Spade are trying to sell brake pads to customers are absolutely hysterical.  I have played the scenes for sales personnel as great examples of how ""not to sell"".  The movie is so full of classic one-liners, that it gets funnier every time I watch it. I recommend the movie, not as an artistic masterpiece by any means, but a funny and touching story.

One of the few times an SNL cast worked well on the big screen.  I had to get the DVD now that I have worn out my tape.  I also appreciate that this movie does not have to be crude, vulgar or violent to be entertaining.  Goes to show what can be done when they take the time to write a decent script.

In ""Tommy Boy"" and ""Black Sheep"",  the oversized accident waiting to happen is so funny, so hilarious, so  abnoxious, so, so CRAZY!  ""Saturday Night Live"" star David  Spade, who worked with Farley on that show for years, stars in both films  as Farley's nerd sidekick. ""Black Sheep"" and ""Tommy  Boy"" are among the favorite movies of my life, and definitely the best  most spectacular comedies of the generation!",955152000,,652,4.741071428571429

The whole housekeeping dialogue is utterly hilarious and the highway  incident with the hood of the car is even more funny.  Farley and Spade go  together like peanut butter and jelly. Probably the best movie I know of  that stars people who orignated from Saturday Night Live  Anyone who likes  a good comedy, this is the one to see. GRADE: B+",953596800,,549,4.366336633663367
