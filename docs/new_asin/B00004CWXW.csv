7919931,4,B00004CWXW,"A numberous movies have the infamous Ed Gein-case as a source of inspiration. The alienated farmer who apparently suffered from an over-dominated mother who taught her son that women in general were vile, dirty and `not done' lived in his own fantasyworld which let to grave-robbery, collecting body parts and human skin to make numerous artefacts out of them, and eventually killing. Although it had to be said that the killing was more out of curiossity than out of lust, resentment or anything hatefull.

The first movie about the enstranged young man with a mother that even kept on guarding him long after she had perished is the Hitchcock classic ""Psycho"". Dark humor and suspense throughout, but not really a fact-based case study of the Gein case.

Doing a little more justice to the source is the 1974 ""The Texas Chainsaw massacre"", the grand daddy of all horror movies. It's a no-holds-barred outburst of insanity, mayhem and perversities. Not one but three local loonies, one with a mask made of human skin, terrorize a bunch of teenagers. The cheap but effectve way in which it was shot suggested a lot more than it actually showed and gave the movie a reputation of being extremely gory, while in fact, almost all fysical harm is done in the audience's mind. The stench of rotting flesh and withered skin however is almost tangible here and the insanity raised throughout this one has never been equalled.

But in that same year a lesser known film was made. Also on a limited budget, it is ""Deranged"" here, that comes closest to the nocturnal, goulish alter-live of Ed Gein.

Roberts Blossom is perfectly cast as the local farmboy Ezra Cobbs who looses his mother and becomes a kind of recluse.

He does mingle sometimes with the locals, staying over for diner, doing odd jobs for them, but one feels that he really lives in another time and place.

And that time and place being his oppressed youth were his dominating mother messed up his mind, making other women seem like some kind of natural enemy to man.

Going down a mental spiral, Ezra starts to dig up corpses and make tools and other things outof the bones and skin. He even starts to dress up in human suits.

Yet still he starts to feel sincere emotions for other women and at times he tries to make contact. But his mind is allready screwed up too much, and he is on the brink of sanity. The Point of No Return is reached when he unpurposely kills his first victim.

The real tragedy here is that Ezra himself isn't aware of him anything `doing wrong'. He is a nave, almost patheticly disturbed man, unaware of his mental sickness.

We, however, are. And that we still sympathise for this man is thanks to a powerful though low-key performance by Robberts Blossom.

And let's forget about the irritating ""intermezzo's"" by a laughable journalist who intrudes the story from time to time and gives a kind of visible voice-over (I believe that nowadays we would put a guy like this on an audio commentary track).

""Deranged"" is an obscure film that doesn't diserve its very obscurity. It's rough, juicy thrills mixed with some dry humour, a true sense of the awkward and insane, and a leading actor that manages to be a drama more than just a perversity.",1152403200,5,3229,4.675485008818342
