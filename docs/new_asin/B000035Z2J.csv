In the first episode on this volume, Episode 9, the last of the main characters who join the Bebop crew is introduced.  This character, Ed,  loves to hack around with computers.  Those of you who grew up in the  1960's will love Ed... this character is as weird as one of those flower  children!  And as you may guess, Episode 9 does involve computers as  well... How, you may ask?  Well, satellites controlled by computers are  drawing doodles on Earth!  But who is controlling them?  The suspense  builds up as Spike and the others attempt to solve the mystery....  Episode  10 gives us a glimpse into Jet Black's past life... it seems that he used  to be a police officer on Ganymede, and this past will be important to  hunting down the bounty in this episode.  It involves a lost love of Jet's,  and this girl's new boyfriend.  But as Spike and Jet find out, this new  boyfriend has a bounty on his head!  Can Jet stick to his sense of duty and  capture the bounty?  Stay tuned.  BTW, the volume ends with a preview of an  episode that is one of the scariest previews that I have ever seen....",951350400,,1181,4.351851851851852
