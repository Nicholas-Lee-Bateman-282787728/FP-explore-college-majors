1622725,5,B00005LIN2,"The triumphant Maria Callas and the brilliant Tito Gobbi are here a revelation for those to whom opera is only and too simply listening for beautiful sounds.  It's true that Callas' high notes are on occasion acidic at this Paris debut and that Gobbi tends to bark from time to time. But these are criticisms best suited to people who'd no more look at an opera singer than stare at a radio.  If one listens externally for purity of notes, one will in spots be disappointed.  But if one is open to how incarnational an art Callas and Gobbi practiced, the supreme suitability of phrasing to the required emotion, the brilliance of facial expression and body movement overwhelm any quibbles as to this or that note not being perfectly in place. In short, neither of these great artists is merely singing notes.  They're inside their roles and singing the hell out of them.  As a singing lesson, this is about as good as it gets.",1017446400,8,926,4.587878787878788
1622726,5,B00005LIN2,"It's so unfortunate and unfare, that there is no full opera recording featuring legendary diva, Maria Callas. What is available on VHS or DVD is just several concerts and fully staged II act from ""Tosca"" (two versions, this one and later one, 1964). I love all these concerts, every one is special for some particular reason. This one opens with ""Casta Diva"", from ""Norma"", which was Maria's one of the favourite roles and she sings it so well, so effortless, with such musical beauty. Then comes amazing performance of ""Una poco"", which I love the most on this DVD. It seems to me that Callas is not singing at all, her mouth opens the way as if she is just talking, even on the high C she stays so calm and so effortless. In my opinion Callas shouldn't have sung havier roles, which eventually ruined her beautiful voice, however I understand that singer always wants to achieve more. Although Callas voice was exactly right for belcanto singing and this aria is vivid example. The next on the DVD is Trovatore, aria followed by Miserere from last act. As I sad, Callas shouldn't have sung such dramatic roles, however this particular extract sound perfect.
And finally comes Tosca, II act, fully staged, whith Tito Gobbi. It is so amazing to watch just what these two greatest artist do on the stage, it is really unbelievable. If I compare this Tosca to 1964 version, I should say, Callas is better on this DVD, while Gobbi sounds better on 1964 recording for me. In whole, ""Toujours"" is must have, Callas was so great, true opera lover must not miss the chance to get her live recording.",1003881600,52,1592,4.628975265017668
1622727,5,B00005LIN2,Despite some edgy high notes this Paris gala finds Callas at her best. The challenging program alternates between lyric and dramatic arias with several moments justifing this as a must have dvd. The descending scale at the end of the Casta Diva is uniquely Callas-no one sings like this. The Act two of Tosca is phenomenal especially the Vissi D'arte aria. When Callas sinks to her knees at the aria's end and you hear all Paris applaud it's as if you're in the audience.,998956800,16,471,4.619047619047619
1622728,5,B00005LIN2,"Ever since I began listening to opera a few years back, I have been a big Callas fan. This DVD is pure gold. After listening to her recordings, and the sheer drama in that heart-stopping voice, it was incredible to see her in action, live on stage. If not for all of the other amazing arias she sings, you must buy this DVD just to see her perform ACT II of Tosca with Titto Gobbi. Unlike the other live recording of ACT II Tosca at Covent Garden (1965), this recording was made in 1958, during a time when she was in really good voice. Titto Gobbi too puts on a spectacular show of the evil Scarpia - after seeing Titto Gobbi's Scarpia, I just hate this guy!
If you believe that Opera is not just singing, but acting as well, you don't want to miss this ACT II. In other words, BUY THIS DVD NOW! Even if you won't be able to eat for 3 days, buy it! Atleast you'll have soul food.",997747200,16,880,4.092485549132948
1622729,5,B00005LIN2,"There remain only a handful of videos of Maria Callas in performance. This Paris, 1958 debut is one of the most important, compelling, and satisfying.  The evening begins with three operatic selections in concert: from NORMA, Casta Diva; from IL TROVATORE, D'amor sull-ali rosee and the subsequent Miserere, and from BARBER OF SEVILLE, Una Voce Poco Fa.  These are all performed with deep insight and characterization that one would expect of a fully staged and complete opera performance. The gestures, facial expressions and attitudes that Callas uses, telegraph to the viewer immediately why this woman was and is still today a one of a kind genius of vocal and visual dramatic expression.  No one with the possible exception of Renata Scotto has begun to achieve the total involvement and commitment on stage which seemed to be second nature to Callas. Some may quibble about her voice and although admittedly in good voice, this evening finds Callas in slightly less pristine voice than I'm sure she would have wished on such an important occasion.  However, after the Bellini, Callas seems at her vocal best with more vocal flashes of color and changes of mood than one can imagine in any present day singer.  For example, just try and imagine anyone today jumping from the dramatic suffering of Leonora's Misere to the coy, capricious and comic coloratura roulades of Rosina's aria in a matter of minutes, as Callas does with total success.  After this first half of the evening is over, we are treated to the complete and fully staged second act of Puccini's TOSCA -- with nonother than Tito Gobbi in the role of Scarpia.  Although costumed and quaffed rather dubiously, Callas gives a totally authoritative performance by which all others should be judged.  What a shame no footage of an Act I or Act III exists. (Another Act II from Covent Garden in 1964 exists and will be released shortly on EMI DVD.)  Admittedly, this video is from 1958 and in Black and White, so don't expect to be stunned by visual quality. DO expect to be stunned by WHAT you are watching rather than the quality of the actual telecast. Enough praise cannot be given to EMI for releasing this concert, her Hamburg concerts from 1959 and 1962 and the upcoming Convent Garden material from 1962 and 1964.  Collect them all; listen, watch and learn.",994291200,36,2330,4.861111111111111
1622730,5,B00005LIN2,"There was no one before or since her that can touch that voice.  If you are a true fan of talent, even the tiniest imperfection just makes her human.  Fabulous music.",1256342400,2,166,4.32258064516129
1622731,5,B00005LIN2,"Unfortunately, the great Callas left us a plethora of audio recordings and no complete opera on video. I know several people who have assisted in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in 1951. Ensure that all the Greek soprano had a unique voice and a dramatic flair unmatched. He worked the character completely, gave his all and was one of the pioneers in bringing the arts to the opera. In video, we have exhausted ""La Callas Toujours,"" bringing in the first part of a concert with works by Bellini (Norma), Verdi (Il Trovatore) and Rossini (Il Barbiere de Siviglia). His voice and his dramatic talent has been reflected in concert, leaving a serious Trovatore for a comic Rossini. Callas does not just stand still and sing, even in a concert she plays. Many singers today have not learned the lesson, are like a pole.
The best is the second part of the program, the entire second act of Puccini's Tosca, in full version, with sets and costumes. Whoever comes is the great Tito Gobbi, one of the great baritones of the mid-twentieth century. Voice mass grave, massive and exceptional performance.
Callas Tosca and have everything in common. Were made for each other. His voice dark, bulky and elusive tone is perfect for the heroine of Puccini. Its performance is another factor that turns on Callas Callas. Today is the obligation to know singer act, but in the distant year of 1958 was rare. Callas was one of the pioneers in bringing the theater to opera.
The genius of it was manifested on stage and busy life. He put about 300 trouble around the world. One was in Rio de Janeiro, where they have thrown an ashtray and hit the director of the Municipal Theater of the time, Baker Pinto. O buddy, with all the pomp and circumstance, tried a pass that turned out badly, had no idea who he was stirring.
My friend Edson Lima, one of the most knowledgeable opera in Brazil and in the theater at this time, had the opportunity in 70 years, talking with Callas. She vowed to stand by that even threatened the said cujo. Lenda or reality, I do not know but in the case of Callas, anything is possible.

La Callas -Toujours, Paris ,1958 e uma encrenca no Rio de Janeiro em 1951.

Infelizmente, a grande Callas nos deixou uma infinidade de gravaes em udio e nenhuma pera completa em vdeo. Conheo diversas pessoas que a assistiram em So Paulo e no Rio de Janeiro em 1951. Todas garantem que o soprano grego tinha uma voz nica e um talento dramtico inigualvel.  Entregava-se ao personagem completamente, dava tudo de si e foi uma das precursoras em trazer as artes cnicas  pera. Em vdeo,  temos o esgotado ""La Callas-Toujours"": trazendo  na primeira parte  um concerto com peas de Bellini (Norma), Verdi  (Il Trovatore) e  Rossini  (Il Barbiere de Siviglia). Sua voz e seu talento dramtico j transparecem no concerto, saindo de um srio Trovatore para um cmico Rossini. Callas no se limita a ficar parada e cantar: mesmo em um concerto,  ela interpreta.  Muitas cantoras at hoje no aprenderam a lio, ficam que nem um poste.
  O melhor  a segunda parte do programa, todo o segundo ato da Tosca de Puccini, em verso completa, com cenrios e figurinos. Quem a acompanha  o grande Tito Gobbi, um dos grandes bartonos da metade do sculo XX. Voz de massa grave, enorme e uma performance excepcional.
  Tosca e Callas tem tudo em comun. Foram feitas uma para a outra. Sua voz escura, volumosa e de timbre indefinvel  perfeita para a herona de Puccini. Sua atuao  outro fator que transforma Callas em Callas. Hoje  obrigao cantor saber atuar, mas no distante ano de 1958 era raridade. Callas foi uma das pioneiras em trazer o teatro  pera.
  O gnio dela se manifestava no palco e na vida atribulada. Arrumou umas 300 encrencas pelo mundo afora. Uma  delas foi no Rio de Janeiro, onde dizem ter atirado e acertado um cinzeiro no diretor do Teatro Municipal da poca, Barreto Pinto. O amigo, com toda a pompa e circunstncia,  tentou uma cantada e se deu mal, nem imaginava com quem estava mexendo.
  Meu amigo Edson Lima, um dos maiores conhecedores de pera do Brasil e presente no teatro na poca,  teve a  oportunidade,  nos anos 70,  de conversar com Callas.  Ela jurou de p junto que nem sequer ameaou o dito cujo. Lenda ou realidade , no sei mas,  em se tratando de Callas,  tudo  possvel.

1622732,5,B00005LIN2,"Given 'la callas'' penchant for perfection, they are probably still cleaning the blood off the stage at the Paris Opera. It's pretty obvious that everyone was nervous for this special debut (particularly the chorus and the tenor ... and perhaps even the conductor) ... BUT ... that aside ... this is truly a performance to treasure for all fans of opera.  Nothing can dim the Callas/Gobbi combination in their traveling 'ACT 2,TOSCA SHOW'.  It's interesting to compare it with the Covent Garden version of a few years later.  Both are well worth having.",1230422400,,553,4.924731182795699
1622733,5,B00005LIN2,"I was eight years old when I saw this appearance of Mme Callas on TV. Eight years, and I was shocked for life.
My eyes could not leave the TV screen for one second, and afterwards I immediately withdraw to my room, pulled down pictures of Swedish pop stars from my wall and replaced them with a large photo of Maria, newly found in a weekly magazine. I was shocked, not only by her intensy and performace during that specific evening in 1958, but for lifetime. I repeatedly asked my father if he could take me to the Royal Opera in Stockholm, but it was not to be until 1972, when I had my first opportunity to visit the Opera House myself. I did not know much of Wagner but already had a Swedish idol in Birgit Nilsson, so my first real experience in Stockholm was a complete Ring des Nibelungen with Nilsson. Now 23 years old, I was shocked again and since then opera has never left my life. I will never forget that my interest was so unexpectedly woken by the flame of Maria Callas from Paris. How happy I was when this DVD appeared!",1209859200,6,1037,4.269035532994923
1622734,5,B00005LIN2,"Casta Diva, sung by Callas, has always been one of my favourite pieces of music. The woman was phenominal, despite her being a real 'Diva.'

To be able to see a remastered film copy of a concert that took place back in 1958 is just simply thrilling.

Highly recommended.",1174262400,3,270,4.489795918367347
1622735,5,B00005LIN2,"What I have enjoyed the most is watching the contrasts of this performance to the Callas Covent Garden video recording.  Here, Callas is at her glamourous best.  For example, the TOSCA in this recording presents a coutured diva whose dramatics are down a notch from the CG performance.  Vocally, I think she is better here - but dramatically, the CG performance is superior.

I am glad to have this, if only to compare the two performances of ACT II TOSCA.  It is also an excellent lesson in the grace and deportment of a true opera star.  Such style!  Such expression!  (The concert portion of this is similar to the Hamburg recording.)",1090800000,17,637,4.675675675675675
1622736,5,B00005LIN2,"Of all the available visual samples available of Maria Callas this is the best and most loyal. In this peformance we are treated to some of Callas' most famous arias with dramatic changes in character and musical style. We begin with the bel canto treat of selections from Norma- Callas' famous ""Casta Diva"". Unfortunately the chorus who sings with her is horrible and off time which detracts from an otherwise perfect experience. No one was able to match the sheer expressiveness and fluid phrasing of Callas in this arena. Next selections from Il Trovatore are dramatic and again showcase the amazing phrasing which no other artist has been able to match. Leonora is shown to us as a living breathing person rather than just some pretty arias and a chance to showcase vocal beauty. Callas may not deliver the full throated beauty of other singers in this role, but you will never find a more fully developed and well phrased character in a role which was meant to be acted- not showcased for vocal fireworks. Then, she switches yet again into the comic light coluratura of Rosina's aria from the Barber of Seville. This was an aria she often performed in recital- yet rarely was she ever in such good voice as in this presentation. One overly eager fan began to shout brava in the middle of her aria while others shushed him. By far the highlight though is the staged preformance of act 2 of Tosca with Tito Gobbi. If you have ever heard Callas' Tosca then I need not comment of the genius she brought to this role. The greatest highlight of which is her Vissi D'arte which I dare you to sit dry eyed through. Her magnificent voice and unmatched vocal expression milk that aria for all it's worth. It is a shame that we weren't able to see Callas ealier when her voice was fuller and in richer bloom- but here we have her in fine voice and her usual dramatic perfection which she only achieved later in her career- this DVD is well worth it- discover La Divina today!",1086998400,25,1969,4.564971751412429
1622737,3,B00005LIN2,"After I wrote some opinions on Callas' Hamburg recitals on DVD, I received from Theo of Athens a sardonic, catcallish email which I instantly responded to and then had my email address taken off Amazon to forestall any future puerile, boorish hate mail.  Now for this DVD.  I was very disappointed.  Casta diva is a warhorse and one of the most boring arias I have ever heard.  This performance (notwithstanding the voice-over pronouncements of Callas' overwhelmingly overwhelming success) was punctuated with more coughs than a tubercular ward.  The Rossini was a treasure and the Verdi was wonderful.  But the Tosca.  Puccini and Donizetti (and Bach) are my favorite composers, and Tosca was my first opera and along with Rigoletto is my favorite.  I have heard better Toscas, even (particularly) from Callas on CD.  It was a  chance of a lifetime actually to see Callas and Gobbi together, but as I thought after the Hamburg concerts and am positive now, I will stick to CDs of the voice and let the movies pass.  One note.  This flick's audio and video qualities were, with just one or two glitches, perfectly fine.  I liked (and recommend) this DVD for its ""historical"" value, not for its musical.",1083196800,9,1202,4.862068965517241
1622738,5,B00005LIN2,"As this is a recital, we don't have the other parts/settings etc except for Tosca. The recorded sound is not as good as one would expect, nor is the photography: they are slightly below the best standard of the time.
Yet we have a lot of music and drama. All the credits go to Callas. People say the violin is the devil's instrument. I say this is only one side of the coin and Callas, Caruso etc will show you the other side. The violin may be a difficult enough instument to learn but with a singer, we have to be borned with the voice, and then there is so much to learn. After all that, the singing career is piteously short for once her interpretation is really interesting, she will soon pass her prime...
But it's rewarding, as a lot of pianists would refer to Callas for the art of phrasing and one is none but Alfred Brendel. Well, her Norma and also her Verdi are so impressive that one would say that is the ultimate limit of music or indeed of any art form. Needless to say, her acting is totally convincing too.",1055289600,9,1024,4.256410256410256
1622739,4,B00005LIN2,"I first came across this film when it was released in one of those ""laser discs"" developed by Pioneer a couple of decades ago, nowadays gone the way of the Betamax, superseded by newer, although not always better, technologies. This EMI release contains most of that laser disc's contents, for some reason leaving out the initial segment (some dozen minutes I estimate), one that included introductory shots that showed the cars going round the Place de l'Opra under a heavy rain to disembark their illustrious passengers, then proceeding inside to pan across the vast hall before the recital starts, spotting for us a few of the ""tot Paris"" that had attended the gala evening when Maria Callas would first sing before them, people like Juliette Greco, Brigitte Bardot, Charlie Chaplin and others, then went on to show the entrance of then French President Ren Coty, allowing us to listen to the National Anthem and then to the overture of Verdi's La Forza del Destino. This dvd release  catches up when the latter has ended and Callas makes her grand entrance. Substituted for the segment I've described EMI have decided to give us some sort of a colour ""guided visit"" of the theatre, which resumes variously within the programme as we switch from one composer to another. A real loss, as the original film placed us within a marvellous context, allowing us to feel the atmosphere of the evening, as close as one can more than four decades away, and allowing ous to savour the diva's entrance practically as much as the Paris audience on 19/12/58 did. And whatever information one gets on the Palais Garnier in the new segment one can also get (and more) from the green Michelin guide.
Musically, the film is a mixed bag. There are magical moments in the recital, true, and the second half comprising the better of her filmed second act of Tosca (staged and in costume) with Gobbi giving his famous portrayal in top form makes it worth purchasing the disc alone, in spite of a defficient Cavaradossi, but by the time Callas came to Paris her voice no longer was the instrument that had given a solid floor to her legendary fame, justly earned on the Milan, London or Rome stages. Faulty (or ill-placed) breath takings are not uncommon, there's some shouting in the Tosca and she wobbles sometimes (the Verdi segment is especially affected). But anyway, documents like these are rare indeed and are a must. The Abbey Road engineers have improved the sound quality (mono, of course) over previous releases, as well as the image, and there is a very interesting and informative article by Gramophone magazine's well-known contributor, contributor John Steane.",1046649600,16,2657,4.878318584070796

7944050,5,B00005LIN2,"Another brilliant video presentation of the genius that was Maria Callas. This preservation of her debut at the Paris Opera House presents her at the peak of her exceptional powers and within seconds she has the Parisians firmly in the palm of her hand as she brilliantly performs first arias from Bellini's NORMA, then segues into Verdi's IL TROVATORE, before ending the first half of the show with Rosssini's IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA. But it is the second half when she lifts those who were there then and we who are watching now into the heavens itself with a fully costumed and staged performance of the second act of Puccini's TOSCA. Here we have one of the few recorded instances of Callas performing in an opera and see why she was and is to this day hailed as ""La Divina"" and why her Floria Tosca is still the standard against which all performances of the role are compared. When she finishes the beautiful aria ""Vissi d'arte"", the audience in the Paris Opera House that night stops the show to give her a tremendous standing ovation. If you are a Callas fan, then this is a MUST buy. And, if you are not, you have but to view this DVD and you will be. All hail La Divina!!!",1488931200,,1182,4.451612903225806

7944055,3,B00005LIN2,"I have to agree with the reviewer Juan Vogelsang; this DVD is a disappointment for anyone who has seen the original video of Callas' 1958 Paris concert in its entirety. I had it on an EMI laserdisc entitled Maria Callas: Debuts a Paris. That was the complete concert, including the audience arriving, the entrance of the French president, the Marsellaise, the original 1958 voice-over, and the overtures to La Forza del Destino and The Barber of Seville. Neither are superlative performances, but the concert had an atmosphere that is largely lost in this release, and the shabbily filmed and cheesily narrated interludes in and around the Palais Garnier are no substitute.

If you haven't seen the 1958 concert in its entirety, you won't be disappointed by this release -- it captures Callas' searing intensity as a stage performer, as well as her charm in the Barbiere aria. But for anyone looking to replace the earlier laserdisc or VHS release, you should know that this isn't an exact reissue and that the experience suffers by comparison because of the omissions.",1291161600,5,1069,4.972067039106145

As a reviewer above points out, deleting this portion of the program: the entrance of the french president, the views of some of the glamorous guests, the national anthem and finally, the overture of la Forza del Destino, has done some damage to the context and environment of the video..instead EMI includes a brief documentary of Palais Garnier shot in such a poor quality, which, by the way, should have been left as a bonus program, perhaps. Also, I find a lot of jitter in the close ups of this dvd video. These constant movements are eye bothering..I don't recall seeing these problems on the original VHS video.. I would recommend to buy the VHS version of this 1958 concert of Callas that has the entire program ..apart from all of these technical problems as described, this concert is a must for all Callas friends",1282435200,2,905,4.6625

Watching this archival recital, we must remind ourselves that black and white taping outside the studio was unkind to most women, less so to the men, and that the sound, too, suffers. Never having seen Callas perform, I cannot judge the fidelity of what one sees to what one might have seen if in the audience,nor if in the audience at any live performance. However, in this case, something is far better than nothing, and, therefore, I can commend this to anyone with an art-historical interest and, of course, anyone whose love of opera allows them to take what we have in order to see again one of the great stars of our time.
The program is sufficiently diverse to get some idea of her versatility and for the expert among us to make some judgment of the quality of her singing. I am willing to settle for the comment of the late Beverly Sills, that Callas was THE actress-singer of her time.
Incidentally, it is good to see Tito Gobbi perform the Puccini Tosca scene with her. Clearly, he was another of her breed, an actor-singer of high attainment.
The commentary is not intrusive and, happily, there are complete (although, sometimes, confusing) subtitles.

But next she sings from Il Trovatore--alone on stage, but fully displaying the dramatic acting that made her performances legendary.  Next, after the high drama, comes a lighter vocal talent showcase for soprano.  Although she has already won over the live Paris audience, her lighthearted (yet very demanding of skill) aria from Rossini's Barber of Seville leaves them charmed and delighted.  Then, the final high notes bring down the house.

As the narrator of this documentary says, the night is no longer a success, but a triumph.  Waves of applause go on and on.

Could there be anything that would add to this magic evening for television viewers in Europe in 1958?

How about fully-staged scenes from Act II of Tosca!!
