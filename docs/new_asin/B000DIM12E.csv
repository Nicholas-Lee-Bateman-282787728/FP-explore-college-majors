8516121,5,B000DIM12E,"This video sure showed Dick Kirby of Quaker Boy Game Calls on some exciting bowhunting adventures as he collects the Grand Slam of Wild Turkeys with a bow and arrow, a feat I hope to accomplish myself someday. He started out in Florida for the Osceola, Texas for a Rio Grande, Georgia for the Eastern, and ends it all up in Nebraska with a beautiful Merriam's. This video should be a good edition to a Turkey Hunter's collection",1514246400,,428,4.5
