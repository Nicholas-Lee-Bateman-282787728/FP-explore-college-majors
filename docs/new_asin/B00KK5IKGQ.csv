8659586,3,B00KK5IKGQ,Just started watching but I have no sound (my fault?). So it's kind of boring to me.,1527120000,,84,4.0
8659587,5,B00KK5IKGQ,"I enjoyed the DVD. I saw some things I hadn't known existed in Tokyo such as a Statue of Liberty and other neat structures. Like the other DVDs, it was interesting to be part of the ride.  I enjoyed the scenes that were put together. I forgot that I was on a treadmill while looking at the scenery. The pace of the three walks was good. I would either walk or run. Having never been to Tokyo, I found the scenes quite interesting. I am glad I bought it.",1522540800,,453,4.089887640449438
8659588,5,B00KK5IKGQ,Great scenic walks. Almost like being there. They run far too short for an average treadmill workout though. I am usually on a treadmill anywhere from one hour to two and a half hours. Being able to go for these walks at night is very nice as I tend to be a night person.,1462492800,2,271,4.037037037037037
8659589,2,B00KK5IKGQ,"Disappointed with the video quality of these. Bought 3 different ones. They are advertised as HD, but on the low end of the scale maybe. Even with playing on a blue ray player on a 4k TV, the video quality is more like SD than HD.",1447891200,2,230,4.021739130434782
8659590,5,B00KK5IKGQ,"Since I can't go to Japan, this lets me stroll around in some very cool places. It's so magical at night. I highly recommend this. The quality is excellent. It's fun to talk to the people that you pass, even though they obviously can't hear you. LOL!",1444003200,2,250,4.340425531914893
8659591,5,B00KK5IKGQ,"I have a new favorite Virtual Walks DVD and it is this one.  I love the lights and skyline of the city after dark.  The Rainbow Bridge and the harbor view were magnificent. It is a whole new experience to be able to walk safely at night in a big city.  Now, I can do just that with this great video and stay in good shape, too.  This DVD also works well with a cycling routine, gazelle workout  or jogging on the treadmill.

The three twenty minute walks can be looped together or individually for an uninterrupted workout.  I hope that Tony's group will film more videos at night.  The colors and clarity of this night video were brilliant.  I highly recommend this video for your exercise workout.",1434758400,,699,4.3984375
8659592,5,B00KK5IKGQ,"This DVD is, just as any other Virtual Walks DVDs I own, wonderfully made. Whether you want to look at the skyline of Tokyo at night or if you want to pass the Meguro River at dawn with its beautiful cherry blossoms, with this DVD it`s all possible.
After you could see the beautiful skyline of Tokyo in the first video, the second video shows the business district. You just feel as if you`re one of those people which are shown in the video and you come home after a stressful day at work.  You also pass the Ginza Shopping Boulevards.
The third video allows you to relax on an evening walk where you can see many cherry blossoms. The sounds match the videos very well and you feel like you're actually walking through Tokyo yourself. You can use this DVD either with your exercise machine or with your treadmill. I will buy the DVD Tokyo Japan real soon to see this beautiful city at daylight.",1428364800,,896,4.397590361445783
8659593,5,B00KK5IKGQ,"Love this dvd! I have always wanted to visit Tokyo. I love the beautiful shopping centers and buildings. And at the end a peaceful evening walk along the river. Just a great walk to exercise to!
