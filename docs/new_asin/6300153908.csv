In their second volume of delightfully daffy cartoon adventures, the Potato Head Kids are looking for fun ... and they find it!  First the kids set out to discover Captain Potatobeard's treasure in POTATO HEAD PIRATES.  Then, Puff is captured by Grease and his gang.  Not to fear ... ROBIN POTATO HOOD rescues her!  Next, a haunted house contains some scary POLTERGEIST POTATOES ... or does it?  The kids find a spooky spud is really a lonely old man who needs some friends.  Finally, a TRASHCAN DERBY race provides the exciting backdrop for Smarty Pants' race car to win the big event.  So join the Potato Head Kids for laughs, looniness, and loveable shenanigans.  You'll find these spuds always have a tater-rific time!  Video runs approximately 40 minutes.",1155168000,2,801,4.866666666666666
