5568826,5,B00BAY1EOQ,"Suspence,mistery and an unexpected ending. The script and the dialogues are very well written (Farhan and Zoya Akhtar did a very good job)amalgamated by the director, Reema Kagti, with  photografy and music in an amazing and unusual way for a Bollywood movie.

5568827,5,B00BAY1EOQ,"Was this movie made more for an American aesthetic than an Indian one? Indian reviewers and friends have objected to the ending, the music, and even Rani Mukerji's appearance without makeup.  Without spoiling the ending, I want to say that I loved it.  I expected dark, but not that dark!  Moreover, even after being surprised by the ending, I have gone on to watch the movie many more times, always finding something new to appreciate in the acting and the music.",1366934400,2,464,4.703703703703703

5568833,5,B00BAY1EOQ,"It has been three years since 3 idiots and Aamir Khan had not returned to the movies, then he decides to make a movie with a small set up and a director called Reema Kagti (Honeymoon Travels and writer Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara), which is a unique state for a star of his stature. Then the delays begin and the endless waiting as the movie gets postponed for release several times for many reasons -that it is similar to Kahaani, it's based on a graphic novel ` An Act of Providence and Aamir's so called head butting with the director ( when has that not happened with Aamir starrers) and finally the endless text messages before the release which gave away the movie ending.
I watched the film on the first day of its release itself, a luxury that I give myself and I loved the film. In my view, after a year of mediocre films - there finally was a film that I could think about for a long time. Armaan Kapoor ( a filmstar) is killed in a freak accident on the promenade near Worli, Mumbai. Inspector Shekhavat ( Aamir Khan) comes in to investigate the accident and tries searching for clues but there are not any. While trying to piece this mess, he is also trying to resolve many personal issues in his life and family. Wifey ( Rani Mukerjee) and Inspector have drifted apart after their sons accident in a boating accident many years ago. He finally discovers that there is a brothel nearby and a helpful escort ( Kareena Kapoor) helps him solve the mystery. Let's just stop here because writing anymore about the story would give it away. When the final credit roll, a lot of you will say..I knew the murderer all along...I wish I could but the movie held my attention...
The screenplay is well written and maintains a steady grip on you throughout the 2 hour and 14 minute runtime. The final 15 minutes were blockbuster and at a point I literally jumped out of my seat, amazing end to a slow stroll....
The cinematography (Mohanan) is another feather in the hat of the makers, and is superb. Mumbai looks so pretty despite the grime and the pollution. The mood and the setting is just so perfect throughout the film.
Kareena Kapoor is miscast (me thought), she looks too glamorous to play the part of a street walker from the rough trade. Nevertheless, she has an extremely important role and she delivers.
Rani Mukherhjee without make up looks so gorgeous.....a dazzling performance of a woman longing for her lost family and husband. Her explosion at Aamir outside their house ( amazing location) fantastic- a professional discovering her craft after years of circus shows.
Aamir Khan delivers yet another finely tuned, underplayed, nuanced performance of many, many layers. This coming after Three Idiots would be like bread between wine tastings to clean the palate. It seems to me that he deliberately choose this role because he wanted people to forget Rancho and embrace the policeman with the creased forehead, scowl and the bags under his eyes from a lack of sleep. He returns to the realm of commercial cinema with Dhoom3 and PK in 2013.
Nawazuddin Siddiqui is in a very significant role and is fantastic. Watch his scene with the prostitute when he confesses his dreams of starting a life with her.
Talaash is an amazing film, a respite from the vulgarity of films in 2012. A great work by Reema Kagti ( She gets it....). Your search for a great film is over....five stars. 11/30/2012",1360454400,18,3401,4.623140495867768

5568843,5,B00BAY1EOQ,"Taalash is a dark thriller starring Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Rani Mukerji. Aamir plays the role of Inspector Surjan who has been assigned to investigate the murder of a famous actor, Armaan Kapoor. He dives into the seedy world of prostitution, henchmen, blackmailing, rivalry and greed. On the personal font he is yet to come to terms with the untimely death of his young son. Seeped in sadness, his wife Roshni (Rani) is also trying to grapple with their loss. While investigating, Surjan comes across a mysterious call girl, Simran (Kareena) who gives him clues regarding the case. How does Simran know these details? Is she connected in the murder of Armaan? Will Surjan and Roshni reconcile to get over their grief?

5568846,4,B00BAY1EOQ,"The title of this movie isn't anybody's name.  It means ""Search"" which is what the characters are engaged in.  The following contains spoilers.

Three criminal teenagers murder a young woman.  Her spirit is stuck between worlds and she is searching for her way.  She sees an opening in a sleep deprived cop's psyche and takes up shelter.  They form a nice friendship and help each other out.  Meanwhile, the cop's departed son wants to express his love for his parents and to help them over their very deep sense of guilt and responsibility over an accident which took his life.  The father is exhausted from the trauma of losing his son.  I think the grief work in this film is quite reflective of what many, most or all people go through to one degree or another.

The backdrop for all of this is embedded within the searches of various characters within the city's underworld.  By doing so, the movie I think blends two aspects of the human condition - activities that harm the soul (greed, crime, etc) at one end with activities in healing it on the other, making for an interesting contrast and synthesis.

If spirits/ghosts, karma, angels, healing from loss, whodunits interest you, I think you might be surprised by this thoughtful film from India.",1379635200,2,1255,4.732718894009216

5568849,4,B00BAY1EOQ,"One late evening, near Mumbai's red light district, a car careens off the infamous Seaface Road and hurtles into the sea. The car's lone occupant doesn't survive the plunge. And when word circulates that the casualty is a famous Bollywood film star, what starts out as a routine auto accident investigation soon catapults the morose lead detective, Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat (Aamir Khan), into a haunting maze of deception, fatal attraction, and murder. Maybe it's significant that similar freak accidents have happened on that same road.

The first two-thirds of TALAASH unfolds as a taut, hard-boiled mystery. And then the third act comes along and pretty much plagiarizes a movie I can't possibly mention because it'll give the whole thing away. As someone mentions in the DVD features, TALAASH, on the surface, is a suspenseful whodunit. But peel that away and we glimpse the essence of the thing. It's about loss and our cast of characters' ability (or inability) to cope with loss.

Surprising absolutely no one, Aamir Khan submits another riveting performance, ratcheting his glower up to white heat intensity even as he masks a tortured vulnerability, a repressed self-loathing. Also, he has a mustache. You can't question the guy's commitment to his role. Khan didn't know how to swim before shooting this film, but he underwent three months of swimming lessons for a particularly arduous underwater sequence. As Inspector Shekhawat, he worries at the threads of his high-profile case, pursuing the elusive clues with admirable tenacity. But one wonders about him. Shekhawat still reels from the loss of his eight-year-old son, and associated pangs of guilt. His marriage is rocky. His patient, long-suffering wife Roshni (Rani Mukerji) abides, but she's taken to consulting a psychic medium. So she, too, isn't over their son's death.

In this confluence of professional morass and personal desolation, Shekhawat unearths a surprising ally. For a while now Shekhawat, unable to sleep, has been haunting Mumbai's seedy underbelly, restlessly driving around. During one such excursion he meets Rosie (Kareena Kapoor), a sympathetic lady of the evening. Rosie tips him to various leads in his case and eventually becomes his confidante. I still think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jab-We-Met/dp/B001KQFAO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jab We Met</a>&nbsp;offered Kapoor her best role, but she's pretty terrific as ""Rosie."" What she does best here is layer in this air of mystery. A suggestive smile. A pained, knowing look. She's good.

TALAASH (meaning ""Search"") has a running time of 140 minutes. Whether you think that's too long depends on whether you'd fallen under the movie's spell. It's a slow burn picture but, me, I liked the neo-noir sensibilities and how polished the movie looks and that the score is often melancholy and occasionally bluesy. The acting is really solid. For two-thirds of the film the screenplay keeps things close to the vest and so I was never quite sure where things were headed, and this was a good thing. I want to say that you're kept guessing to the end, but I'd be fairly astounded if, during the final 30 or 40 minutes, you don't clue in to the big reveal. So, yeah, the ending disappointed me, mostly because up to then TALAASH was staking a claim as an accomplished psychological thriller. As it is, it's still pretty good. Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor keep you invested. Rani Mukerji, however, is wasted.

What I've got is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature film which is in Hindi but offers the option for sub-titles in English, Arabic, French, and Dutch. Disc 1 also has the option to jump to any of the film's musical sequences. Disc 2 has the following bonus stuff (totaling 00:42:09 minutes):

- Making of TALAASH featurette (mostly in English)
- Making of the jazzy musical number """"Muskaanein Jhooti Hai"""" (mostly in Hindi, no English sub-titles)
- ""Snippets"" - 6 short clips lifted from the ""Making Of"" featurette
- 13 Deleted Scenes (with optional English sub-titles)",1375056000,7,4084,5.227480916030534

5568851,4,B00BAY1EOQ,Aamir Khan perfects the weary sorrowful cop.  Rani Mukerji is as beautiful as always and so heartbreaking.

5568852,5,B00BAY1EOQ,"I highly recommend this intelligent film which is crime mystery intertwined with the supernatural. Top notch acting by Aamir, Rani and Kareena along with a solid and emotional storyline that keeps the viewer involved and guessing. The pace of the film is good and I never felt the need to fast forward. Even knowing the outcome of the film, I would watch this film again for the acting and emotional character interplay. I invited my sister to watch this film and she loved it too.

Basic plot summary: Aamir Khan plays an inspector Surjan who is put on the case of film actor Armaan Kapoor who has driven his car off the embankment and subsequently drowned in the sea. The circumstances surrounding the car accident do not fit with suicide, nor is there any evidence of foul play. Meanwhile, Surjan's wife Roshni (Rani Mukerji) is struggling with her grief over the death of the couple's young son, Karan. To avoid his difficult home life, Surjan focuses on solving Armaan's mysterious death. He begins investigating in the nearby red-light district and meets Rosie, an alluring prostitute, who may hold the answer to the mystery.",1370304000,2,1131,4.860103626943006

8565099,4,B00BAY1EOQ,"A dark film, Talaash: The Answer Lies Within, is a 2012 Indian psychological horror thriller film directed by Reema Kagti.

Late at night on a deserted road, well-known actor Armaan Kapoor (Vivan Bhatena) loses control of his car for no evident reason, apparently trying to avoid something, and drives into the sea. Inspector Surjan Shekhawat (Aamir Khan) with his assistant Devrath Kulkarni (Rajkummar Rao) begins an investigation into Armaan's death. Surjan's personal life is in turmoil since his 8-year-old son, Karan, drowned recently during a family outing. His wife, Roshni (Rani Mukerji), is still grieving and Surjan has developed a guilt complex.

Surjan learns that on the night of Armaan's accident, Armaan was travelling with 2 million rupees in cash, which is missing from the car. Armaan had given the money to a blackmailer, a pimp named Shashi (Subrat Dutta). Three years back, Shashi had performed a cover-up for Armaan and his friend Sanjay Kejriwal (Suhas Ahuja). Once he learns of Armaan's death, Shashi takes off with the cash, leaving behind a mistress, Mallika (Aditi Vasudev). Shashi's friend, Tehmur (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), steals Shashi's discarded sim card. Shashi begins blackmailing Sanjay. In panic, Sanjay employs some thugs to murder Shashi. Tehmur begins to use Shashi's old sim card to blackmail Sanjay with Shashi's murder.

Meanwhile, Roshni seeks solace from a medium (Shernaz Patel) who is in touch with Karan's soul. One night, Surjan is propositioned by an escort, Rosie (Kareena Kapoor). He declines Rosie's advances but asks her if she can become an informer. Through Rosie, Surjan finds out about Shashi's connection with the case. The police find Shashi's body, along with the blackmail money and a DVD. The DVD contains embarrassing CCTV footage of Armaan and his friends leaving a hotel with a girl. Convinced of Armaan's link with prostitutes, Surjan focuses his search on the slums near the Hotel Lido. To speak unobserved, Rosie takes Surjan to a quiet place by the riverside and tells him that three years ago, she was picked up by Armaan and his friends, Sanjay and Nikhil (Prashant Prakash). However, she doesn't reveal anything more. Surjan tries to approach Nikhil for more information but discovers that Nikhil has been brain-dead after the incident three years ago. After a heated argument with Roshni, Surjan confides in Rosie, who comforts him by taking him to the Lido.

Tehmur is killed by the two thugs in Sanjay's employ. One of the thugs is captured by the police and reveals that Sanjay has been behind the murders of both Shashi and Tehmur. Surjan arrests Sanjay, who confesses that three years ago, Sanjay, Armaan and Nikhil had picked up an escort to celebrate Nikhil's birthday. While driving, Nikhil began making out with the girl in the backseat. The car door opened by accident, throwing both Nikhil and the girl from the moving car to the road. Both were badly injured. Armaan and Sanjay rushed Nikhil to the hospital but fearing scandal, left the girl unattended on the road. Sanjay had called Shashi to ask him to take care of her. However, Shashi informed them that the girl had died and that he had footage of the three leaving with her. Since then, Shashi had continued to extort money from them by blackmail.

Surjan re-watches the footage and realizes that the girl is Rosie. As he drives Sanjay to the police station, they approach the same road where Armaan had his car accident. Both Surjan and Sanjay see Rosie standing ahead. In a re-enactment of Armaan's accident, Sanjay swerves the car into the sea. With Sanjay already dead, Surjan struggles to get himself out of the car. Rosie appears underwater and saves him. At the police station, Surjan's superior advises him against reporting his incredible story. Surjan agrees to write in the official report that Armaan Kapoor's death was an accident. He returns to the riverside place where he used to meet Rosie and uncovers her remains where Shashi had hidden her body. Remembering that he had been told that ""the dead come to those who are troubled,"" he gives her a proper funeral.

Now more accepting of the supernatural, Surjan finds a letter from Karan, penned by the medium. Through the letter, Karan tells Surjan not to blame himself for his death and that he wants both his parents to be happy. Surjan cries and Roshni consoles him. The two are reconciled.",1469923200,,4398,4.993178717598909
