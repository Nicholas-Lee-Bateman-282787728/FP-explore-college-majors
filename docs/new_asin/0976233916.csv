174112,5,0976233916,"Prior to purchasing this DVD, I heard many things about Forrest Yoga.  All of it good.  I bought the DVD and was initially not impressed with the poses I saw performed.  Then I actually tried the workout and it was great.  The poses performed on this DVD aren't anything a person with 2 or more years of experience could not perform.  With that said, what makes this DVD solid, is the amount of time poses are held and the core abdominal work.  For people who are used to vinyasa flow constant movement type yoga (like myself), this DVD is a nice alternative.  Forrest Yoga is slower flowing yoga (compared to Ashtanga or Vinyasa Flow/Power Yoga) with more of an emphasis on holding poses for a longer period of time.  I look forward to purchasing more of Ana's DVDs.",1121644800,9,767,4.507246376811594
174113,5,0976233916,"I have been waiting for this practice to come out on DVD since it's only been available on tape in the past. I was delighted to find Ana Forrest as wonderful as what I've heard. Her instruction is very similar to Shiva Rea, so if you like Shiva, you'll like this DVD too! It is very challenging with stretching and strengthening along with an emphasis of full breath work.

You start with uddiyana bandha which I have never seen instructed on a DVD before Ana's. Then a gentle warm up on the floor and even dolphin which I love! Then on to a challenging ab session and then a series of lunges and floor poses.

Ana Forrest is a very dynamic, energenic instructor. But, this is not americanized ""power yoga"", this is a real yoga practice where you'll learn about connecting to your body, listening to your body. And no sun salutation, yahoo!!! You also get a demonstration track of Ana's yoga, she is incredible.

I notice amazon doesn't have this avaialable at this time. I purchase on amazon just a week ago and was able to get this DVD from newideafitness. I think you can go to their web site if amazon still does not have it available.

Please check my other reviews on amazon for other great yoga practices. Also, check the VHS version of Strenth & Spirit for many reviews from other people.",1119571200,15,1296,4.478813559322034
174114,5,0976233916,"This video was very simple to follow in the guided poses and Ana's demonstration was too cool!. I love Forrest yoga and a  long as Ana continue to produce these clear videos with precise instructions, I will continue to purchase...Thanks Ana",1191628800,4,241,4.878048780487805
174115,3,0976233916,"...for anyone beyond the absolute beginner level. Ana Forrest is an amazing yogi,but although it is billed as  beginner to advanced, it is really just for beginners, with some excellent tips and adjustments. I was hoping to get some tips for my own practice ( I consider myself an intermediate student), but again, it is really just for beginners.
Also, though amazing to watch, Ms. Forrest takes up  a great deal of the tape  showing what she can do. Struck me as alot of ego for such an accomplished yogi, but maybe that's just me.",1191110400,12,533,4.589473684210526
174116,5,0976233916,"I did not get this DVD in order to 'do it'.  At 61, I doubt I will ever be able to do yoga as Ana Forrest does it.  I purchased this DVD because I wanted to see what a crippled child had been able to accomplish.  Ana's strength...especially upper body strength...is phenomenal.  Most women would never achieve her level of upper body strength.  Whenever I grow discouraged at my 'yoga' strength progress, I watch this DVD and remind myself that persistence and determination can overcome even the seemingly most impossible obstacles.  I use Ana's DVD as a reminder that I can achieve what now seems impossible if I just persist ....taking as much time as needed to accomplish my goal.

I especially love the way Ana encourages the members in her class.  Each time I watch this DVD and listen to her corrections, I learn.  If all I ever do is WATCH this DVD, it will have served its purpose.  Who knows...maybe someday, I will actually be able to yoga with Ana.

174117,4,0976233916,"Strength and Spirit is a wonderfully unique yoga video which provides the kind of detailed instruction that you'd find in an actual live yoga class. Led by Ana Forrest, it features a class of six students of all ages and abilities; Ana alternates between displaying the movements with amazing grace and flexibility and moving amongst her students offering form guidelines and corrections. At the start of the class, she encourages the students to identify an area of focus in their bodies, and throughout the practice, she places a strong emphasize on breathing, reminding students to breathe into their focus areas in particular.

The practice starts in a seated position with uddiyana, the abdominal lock; Ana follows this with a seated forward bend and twist. Then it's on to hands and knees for dophin prelude and dolphin to open up the shoulders. Back in a seated position, you will do a side bend with a neck release and then lie flat on the mat for abs work. This is the most challenging segment of the practice, as Ana has you move very slowly while taking looong, deep breaths, first doing a bicycle movement and then pelvic raises with a second mat rolled up between your legs (I use my Pilates circle for this move).

The second half of the practice centers around standing poses interspersed with gentle backbending movements. The first standing series includes down dog, warrior 1, easy twisting warrior, lunge, and lunge twist (similar to prayer twist, but with a change in arms position). The floor work which follows is an easy half boat pose, and then it's back to down dog. The next standing series consists of a lunge with forearms to the floor, first with the back knee down and then lifting the knee; you then return to the floor for full boat. Coming back into down dog, you move into warrior 2 for some particularly nice shoulder work, first combining a shoulder roll/pinch with breathing and then opening the shoulders further using eagle arms. The final back work is cobra pose performed twice.

After a last down dog, you move into pyramid and then pigeon with a forward bend. Following this, you return to a seated position for one final neck stretch before going back to the floor for savasana. Although the relaxation portion lasts only about 3 minutes, Ana encourages you to remain in savasana for as much time as you have; without an extended savasana, the entire practice clocks in at just under 55 minutes. I've found that every time I do this practice, I learn new things from Ana, as she provides an amazing amount of detail. The pace of the whole practice is quite leisurely, yet the time goes by surprisingly quickly, and I am always left feeling relaxed and refreshed. I would recommend it to all levels of yoga practitioners, although those brand new to yoga will probably want to learn the poses elsewhere first.  The DVD also includes Embodying Spirit, a captivating demonstration of Ana performing a breathtaking flow of poses.

Overall, this is a great DVD with an extremely skilled and competent instructor, and I rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1152230400,5,3078,4.789077212806026

I like Ana's teaching style, and especially like the poses she includes, which are wonderful for loosening up tight shoulders and neck. The Native American style music is unobtrusive, and Ana is encouraging and warm. The video is not a vinyasa flow, but includes a good set of poses: dolphin and down dog, neck stretches, several prone backbends, a good abs section, warriors with extra shoulder stretches, twists, and lunges. In the lovely guided shavasana, Ana includes visualizations of the elements and their connections to the body.",1261958400,24,675,4.982300884955753

The class was discontinued and I haven't done yoga regularly since. I was thrilled to find this DVD on Amazon. Starting up again, I find the poses challenging now compared to ""then"" and realize the benefits from regular practice are significant. Anna encourage students to work at their own level and all levels can benefit from her postures. I think some prior yoga experience is needed, e.g. this might be too much for a first timer. I look forward to regaining the physical benefits I enjoyed when I did this series in the past.  Her teaching is clear and precise.

7794689,4,0976233916,"As with another older woman reviewer, I find Ana's demonstrations of advanced yogic practice inspirational.  I, too, will never attain the level of mastery that Ana has, but I find watching her truly inspirational.  As I do yoga flow on my own at home, I find that I've pushed myself a bit further after doing the class (or watching the demonstration) on this DVD.

This DVD is a good change from the proliferation of fast paced vinyasa flow DVDs out there.  I only gave it 4 stars because I wish there was more material on it.

I like Ana's attention to detail and the longer time that is spent in poses, which allows one to attend to these details.

It is interesting that some say that Ana's style feels outdated.  I suppose it's because she doesn't use East Asian music in the background nor wear fashionable yoga wear?  Also, I would agree with those who find her demeanor a bit off putting.  Quite frankly, she doesn't look like a happy person.  It's too bad, 'cause as much as I like Shiva Rea and her absolutely gorgeous DVDs, I have learnt more from Ana Forest's short DVD.",1199836800,28,1082,4.474489795918367
