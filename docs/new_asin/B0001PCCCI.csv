8016078,5,B0001PCCCI,"This an excellent video by J. Kodzis. It picks up where the first video left off. This one focuses on showing you submissions from the different positions, and then immediately shows you how to counter them.
Easy to follow and good angles to see the techniques. The only minor issue I had was it would have helped to have a visual summary of the steps used after demonstrating the techniques.
Overall, well worth the money and as someone who trains in Shotokan - I learned a lot.",1370822400,,479,4.517241379310345
8016079,5,B0001PCCCI,"Go to the Turtle Press website and check the prices on there before you buy it on Amazon. They often list their DVD's for five bucks. When it comes to quality, I love this DVD. Buy both the first and the second if you are new to BJJ but the counters here are excellent. Most of these moves work for no gi fight (which you need for the cage or the street). Great product made by a military reservist and police officer.",1360800000,,418,4.109756097560975
8016080,5,B0001PCCCI,"Because the instructor on this dvd (and it's companion volume 1) is a cop as well as a long-time jujitsu man, the instruction is combat oriented rather than sport style. There are some elements of sport style jujitsu but I liked the focus on more traditional teaching and the way you got both the offensive and defensive view of each technique. For most techniques, the instructor explains how to apply it then we get to hear from his partner about why the technique works and also how he would counter it. This is a really good teaching method and allows both training partners to work their skills, rather than one guy working on a technique and the other being the ""crash test dummy"". Excellent all around overview of jujitsu.",1137715200,3,729,4.658914728682171
