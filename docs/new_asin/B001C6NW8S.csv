8286150,5,B001C6NW8S,"Once again, a cannot go wrong DVD for toddlers.  If your child likes big Clifford, he/she will love puppy Clifford",1284422400,,114,4.7
8286151,5,B001C6NW8S,"My 4 year old daughter is in love with Clifford, however, she has never seen Clifford Puppy days before.  I gave her 2 videos for a road trip we took over spring break.  Her and my 7 year son were content for almost the whole 4 hour trip.  They happily watched both videos twice.

Nothing new or surprising about the story lines.  One of the charters gets into a pickle and it takes everyone to fix it...then its wrap up and there is a lesson learned by all.

Good messages and funny too.  My kids just loved it.",1271376000,,512,4.163265306122449
