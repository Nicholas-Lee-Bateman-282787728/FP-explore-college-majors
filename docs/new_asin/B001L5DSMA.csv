3679647,2,B001L5DSMA,"I feel that you need to be ""totally fit"" in order to do this workout.  Mel B gives no instruction on form and there is very little modification (one woman does not use ""weights"" during the arm section) to the exercises. Also, the exercises are done at a very fast pace and I'm not entirely sure that this is effective for anything other than the cardio sections.  Advanced exercises may enjoy the fast pace but those looking for instruction and exercises that build upon each other should look elsewhere.",1234051200,6,504,4.651685393258427
3679648,4,B001L5DSMA,"I've been working out to Jillian Michael DVDs for a few months so any new workout I do has to be rigorous otherwise my heartrate doesn't rise.  Mel B's workout, although simple, had my heart pumping with five minutes.  I had to sit down to take a quick breather.  I highly recommend this workout because the moves are simple and very easy on the knees unlike most cardio workouts on the market today.

Now, I give this dvd only 4 stars and here's why:

-1/2 star: Boring music.  It's like stripped chillout music with only drums and a synth or two in one continous track per workout segment.  You don't really notice the music because whoever mixed the audio track had the volume too low.  Just put on your own music and you'll be fine.

-1/2 star: Mel B's cueing & presence.  She jumps right into a move without really explaining what she's going to do.  It's not too bad at all if you've ever seen Turbo Jam (the worst cueing ever)!  Watch the DVD once then cues aren't really necessary since the moves are easy to follow.  Also, Mel B doesn't say much throughout the workout.  Lots of silent moments. I thought she would be a chatterbox!

3679649,4,B001L5DSMA,"Her workout was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be and I am not out of shape. I saw her on Regis & Kelly and thought the dvd looked good. I was looking for something new to add into my routine. I workout everyday either Tae Bo dvd's, elliptical or outdoors running/walking and I felt this! After the short cardio I was burning already. I wouldn't say this is for beginners, but very easy to follow and you can pick and choose what you want to do. Maybe you only want to do cardio or maybe just abs and arms... you pick your workout. She makes it fun and it's something you can do without any equipment. I ""totally"" recommend this!",1233964800,4,642,4.144
3679650,5,B001L5DSMA,"I loved this workout dvd.  It kicked my butt!  I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely out of shape. I don't enjoy going to the gym and have quite the library of workout dvd's, trying to find one that will keep me interested long enough to want to continue with it everyday.  Well, Mel B will keep you going.  I found her funny and quite entertaining.  Even though she is fit and educated in the exercises, I liked the fact that she's not a fitness expert.  During some of the exercises she's complaining right along with me.  Making me more relaxed.
I, also, enjoyed her nutrition segment and found the scenery quite beautiful.  I would recommend watching the dvd first because there were times when she would change exercises and the camera would be focusing on her face, so I would miss the first couple of reps.",1233792000,16,814,4.527397260273973
3679651,4,B001L5DSMA,"4.5 stars -- Mel B's Totally Fit is broken down into 8 segments that you can play in any order you like:

Warm Up (5 min)
Cardio (15 min)
Advanced Cardio (20 min)
Abs (10 min)
Legs (10 min)
Bums (10 min)
Tums (10 min)
Cool Down

For my first time through I did Warm Up, Cardio, Advanced Cardio and Legs, which ended up being around 45 minutes. The cardio sections are cardio bursts ... you don't get a break. You do several exercises for one minute at a time throughout the length of your chosen workout. You don't need anything special. A floor mat for hard floors, and dumbbells are optional. Mel B uses water bottles but I used 5 lb dumbbells instead.

I liked the DVD and felt I got a good workout from it. I've been working out for 2 months now and have lost 15 lbs, so I am getting into better shape and I know this would have KILLED me if I would have started my program by this DVD. I'd recommend this DVD for intermediate/advanced exercisers.

Only two things annoyed me. One, Mel B doesn't really instruct or explain how to do things. You pretty much need to jump right in and follow along. The moves aren't complicated, but sometimes it'd be nice to know if I need to be moving my left or right leg, etc.

The other thing that was annoying was the camera angles at certain points. When a exercise would begin, the camera would zoom in on Mel B's face/abs/whatever, instead of showing the whole picture and letting the viewer see how to execute the move correctly.

Otherwise, I thought this DVD was great and I will definitely work it in to my fitness plan.",1233619200,53,1568,4.2983050847457624

3679749,5,B001L5DSMA,"Mel B's gritty personality is a refreshing break from the perky cheerleader types in my other workout videos, and she's backed by an attractive, multicolored group of ""real"" people. The program is broken up into different segments that you can mix and match to make the workout as long as you like.  It includes a separate warmup, two different ""cardio"" sections that are actually full body workouts, a ten-minute segment for each body part (arms, legs, abs, behind), and finally, a cooldown you can add if you like. The level of the exercises ranges from intermediate to advanced, but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners because she doesn't spend any time explaining the exercises, she just jumps right into it.

3679774,5,B001L5DSMA,When I first bough this dvd it was in November 2011 however I bought that one at Best Buy website . This is my second copy of this dvd and yes it was worth buying twice :). Let me start off by saying that Mel. B kicks butt in terms of the exercises - I highly suggest following what she says and watch the routines from beginning to end because if you don't you will get discouraged and not want to complete the exercises . There are relatively easy steps especially in the advanced cardio section - I can attest to loosing inches off of my thighs and waist line with the cardio routines . I recommend this dvd to anyone who is looking for an exercise dvd that is effective yet fun at the same time .,1360713600,,700,4.079710144927536
3679775,5,B001L5DSMA,"You can tell Mel B. is not a professional exercise instructor. This is just something all celebrities are taking on. This I will tell you, she does kick your butt in this dvd. It is very intense and you will feel the burn and lose weight. You just need to do this dvd (3) times a week. I am very please with this dvd. I was doing the insanity dvd with Shaun T and I have to tell you, I did the first month and it was very hard on my joints. I quit because I was starting to injure myself. I gave Totally Fit 5 stars because it gets the job done and Mel B. has a great sense of humor.",1360195200,,583,3.7868852459016393
3679776,5,B001L5DSMA,"I've had this DVD for like 3 years and it is still my favorite. I love that the segments are broken down by body parts. If you want to do cardio and work out your abs along with your bottom, you can pick those 3 and go for it! I love, love, love it and absolutely recommend it. It challenges you and makes you feel great afterwards :)",1360022400,,334,3.926470588235294
3679777,2,B001L5DSMA,Great exercises but performed way to fast for a beginner and there are no modifiers. Recipes are good. Non stop,1359849600,,111,4.6
3679778,2,B001L5DSMA,"PROS: Good Workouts - all of them are good.  CONS: Absolutely annoying. Mel has no teaching background so there are no cues and the drills are for one minute at a time so for almost the ENTIRE MINUTE of EACH drill she says, ""And up, and down, and up and down.... and in and out and in and out and in and out...and out and in and out and in and out and in....""  She is way too loud and she chatters non-stop.  The music appears to be the same monotanous tune throughout the dvd and it's cheezy elevator music. You'd think a Spice Girl would have better music. I have ordered hundreds of workout dvd's - I know what's good and this is not good instruction or an enjoyable workout. But please note:the workouts are effective - I'll give her that. I was an aerobics instructor and personal trainer for 7 years.  I do not recommend this DVD unless you are spending less than $7 on it and you do not intend on using it often.  I paid $11.83, I use workout DVDs over and over and if I worked out to this one more than once, I would be incredibly annoyed and I'd have to turn the sound down and turn on my headset.",1357516800,3,1106,4.101851851851852
3679779,4,B001L5DSMA,"Rating this a four only because I previously had the deluxe version with bonus ab and back workouts, which I miss. If you can find the deluxe version spring for that (and let me know where you found it). I love this DVD, it's super easy to use to create exactly the workout you want to do. It's easy enough that it's not too intimidating to get started, but not too easy that it's not a good work out. You can adapt it to increase the intensity with more weight or modifications to the moves. Mel B was always my favorite Spice Girl too, so it is just a blast to be working out with her, she makes it fun. The length is also good, you can do just one routine if you are in a hurry, or the whole DVD if you are really pumped. Also, if you are deciding between this and ""Get Fit With Mel B"" for Playstation Move, definitely get this DVD. The PS3 game is boring, and too easy and not very accurate.",1356912000,,895,4.033707865168539
3679780,5,B001L5DSMA,I just got it yesterday in the mail. I was really happy. Brand new for really cheap. Melanie B is very talented and the Spice Girls are amazing. The Work out will be tough. I can't wait to get started!,1356652800,,201,4.05
3679781,4,B001L5DSMA,Mel B shows no mercy!  Her abs are killer and her English accent is a lot of fun.  I always feel good after doing the advanced cardio portion and tums!,1353110400,,151,4.0
3679802,4,B001L5DSMA,"Things I liked:

Dvd was well chaptered and you could choose a specific workout (ie cardio, bum, and tum only).

The nutrition portion of the dvd.  Most exercise dvds would have you believe that if you do their workout, that's all that it takes to achieve fitness. The inclusion of the nutrition portion on the dvd lets people know that proper nutrition is also important.  Mel B gives us some great suggestions and easy recipes.

Mel B is a warm, friendly instructor.  She also provides visual motivation ( the woman is in terrific shape).

Things I didn't like:

Lack of instruction.  During the bum(butt) portion of the dvd, for example.  Mel B demonstrates a kneeling butt kick with a bent knee. It is very important to keep the knee turned under to keep the focus on the butt.  I did not hear Mel B mention this.  She does provide instructions during the stretch portion of the workout, but not during the toning sections.

Still, if you know how to properly perform the movements, and don't mind the lack of cueing (Mel often does not transition from one exercise to the other very well), this is a great addition to your exercise library.",1346284800,,1145,4.608910891089109
3679803,5,B001L5DSMA,"I have over a dozen different exercise DVD's and this is easily my favorite! I've had it for over a year now and it's still very often my go-to DVD.  Mel B makes it fun, makes it real (she shares my pain), and (most impressively) she does all of the exercises with us (unlike Jillian).  She pushes me but in a fun way.  Her accent is great and the pool and ocean background makes me want to be there!  One thing I have noticed, you can make the exercises more beneficial by making sure you step or reach a little farther or bend a little deeper or add more weight.  Some of the exercises can be almost too easy and less beneficial if you don't ""try"" hard enough and she doesn't always stress that. I like doing a minute of each exercise because I spend time working and not trying to follow moves and figure out what I should be doing like I do with some videos that have complicated choreography.  I also like being able to select which segments I do each time.  I really do like this DVD and would certainly recommend it!!  I rarely do product reviews but felt strongly enough about this one to take the time.  :-)",1345852800,,1116,4.226415094339623
3679804,5,B001L5DSMA,"I just did this workout for the first time and I'm in love! I really have a hard time finding workout DVDS I like, simply because the instructors are SO corny. You know none of us smile and grin as we're working out. Let's be real. Mel B made it SO fun and real! She struggles and huffs and groans just like we do. She has her same Scary Spice awesome attitude and I LOVE IT! I was actually laughing throughout the workout, and that's pretty amazing to me!

It's definitely hard but in a good way. In a totally do-able way. I find myself frustrated with a lot of other DVDS because the moves are just too hard sometimes and I want to give up. This made me give up only because my muscles were on fire!! In a good way! Then I'd pick right back up again.

I also have bad knees (at only 22 years old) and this didn't put hard impact on them. It can be really discouraging when a DVD focuses so much on squats and lunges, when you're trying to workout your arms or tummy only. I like that this is broken down into sections that YOU pick and can arrange them any way you want.

I recommend this DVD HIGHLY! I love Mel B and LOVE this workout!",1334793600,,1138,4.0488888888888885
3679805,5,B001L5DSMA,"I'm a Jillian devotee who has a stack of her DVDs to prove it.  Well now, she has competition in Scary Spice!

If you dedicate almost 100% of your workouts to home DVDs, this is a great option that never bores you.  It has a great customization feature that allows you to create the workout that fits your needs.  If I don't feel like doing cardio, that's cool: I can do just abs & bums that day.  Love it!  Also, she includes an awesome nutritional section with a few great ideas for meals.

Mel B's personality is so engaging! As fit as she obviously is, you can tell she's feeling the burn right along with you and is uber-encouraging.  Besides a few Zumba classes, I am an all-DVD exercise girl - I own about 50 DVDs/VHS tapes and this is a favorite - go & buy it!",1332288000,,768,4.1768707482993195
3679806,5,B001L5DSMA,"I have been a ""couch potato"" and very weak and out of shape.  This video is perfect for me; one of it's best features is that it allows you to make your chapter selections up front in the main menu and then it plays just those segments, so there's no stopping and selecting the next workout set you want to make you perfect workout. I also really appreciate that everyday household objects like soup cans and water bottles are offered as options in place of weights or dumbbells.",1331337600,,479,4.443181818181818
3679807,3,B001L5DSMA,"I thought this workout was just okay. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible either.

It did take me a while to start sweating though. Some of the moves did nothing for me, while others really worked those specific areas. I like Mel B as an instructor though; she's funny and actually seems real. She does the entire workout with you, which was nice to see. I also like that she uses water and soup as hand weights, showing the viewers that you can workout with what you have, and you don't necessarily need actual weights to workout.",1326585600,,537,4.479591836734694

Thanks MEL B!!",1325635200,,275,3.981818181818182
3679810,5,B001L5DSMA,"The level of difficulty is about an intermediate level, which explains why Mel B is so muscular. You get to create your own work out with Arm, Legs, Warm up, Cool down, etc on the DVD.

I only have 30-45 minutes in the morning for my workout, so I chose Warm up and about two other work outs..Great way to start the morning.

And for the ""arms"" work-out, get one-two pound weights..three pounds is too much..they use soup cans and water bottles..cute!",1324425600,2,451,4.487804878048781
3679811,4,B001L5DSMA,"This dvd is great!! The workout is separated into sections so you can actually customize your workout! That's a great idea especially if you know you don't have a lot of time to do the whole workout or just want to focus on a certain muscle group. Mel B is really silly and funny and keeps me motivated! She provides variations for the workout depending on if you are a beginner or advanced. I'm a super duper beginner and most of the exercises are very challenging however I just do what I can and keep on moving. If I need a break, I just press pause! I've been doing this dvd for one week and I feel really good. I do the warm up, bums, tums, and cool down. I cannot do the cardio workouts yet as they are very hard for my level(over weight, out of shape lol)! This week I'm adding alternate days of bums and arms!  I've lost 2lbs so something is working. Mel B also has a nutrition section where she demonstrates some of her go to healthy meals.  She has good tips.  I recommend this dvd to anyone . If you're a beginner, keep at it. It is hard but gets easier. Keep a steady pace. Don't get overzealous or you'll pay for it the following day! If you're advanced this dvd should be a fun addition to your workout dvd collection.

Side note - just as other reviewers have said, Mel doesn't always tell you the benefit of the workout you are doing at the moment however, looking at her body is explanation enough.  She looks 'abs'solutely amazing!!! When watching the video, keep in mind that Mel is not a fitness instructor, but she's showing us what she does to stay 'Totally Fit'. So I like the fact that she doesn't tell us that a certain movement is working out Supraspinatus or Quadratus Lumborum. She's showing us moves that actually work! And she's suffering through the burn right along side us! Thanks Mel B for an awesome workout!",1322956800,,1843,4.34593023255814
3679828,5,B001L5DSMA,"First off, I LOVE how this workout gives you the option to customize it. There's a menu where you can select the workouts you want and it'll play just them, so you can go through the entire dvd or just focus on a couple body parts or all cardio, whatever you have time for and want.

This dvd is simple (I have plenty of dance/aerobic dvds that I STILL can't do all the moves in and kind of feel silly doing them at times--not a problem with this dvd!), challenging, and Mel B is a fantastic instructor and I find her really ""real"" in this--she is clearly having fun and yet working really hard and it doesn't come across as try-hard at all, if that makes sense? She's relatable and that makes it so much more enjoyable as a viewer. Actually, between using household items like soup cans and water bottles instead of weights and flirting with her husband in her kitchen (or what appears to be her kitchen at least) while making a crock pot dinner in the nutrition/eating section of the dvd, it seems that they tried to make this pretty down home for a celeb workout dvd. And I think they succeeded.

Bottom line: this dvd is WONDERFUL and definitely worth a spot in your collection as well. You'll love it!",1321747200,2,1206,4.379464285714286

I have had it for about a month and i do it, almost everyday! if your just starting out this might be a little bit difficult but its defentily worth a try. I work out everyday and im very fit and i still fill the burn after using it so many times. Another thing i really like is you can create your own workout by chosing which sections you want to work on and in what order. get it! its great!",1314403200,2,517,3.7962962962962963

I my arms, legs, bums, and everything were burning like crazy! The only things I didn't like were some of the clothes Mel B was wearing. When I did the warm up (i'm not bisexual) but I couldn't help but keep looking at her bulging boobs! I guess it's okay to flaunt it if you've got it. The other thing I didn't like is when they showed parts of her body that weren't completely irrelevant to the workout. The pros are that she encourages you to use items in your house as weights or no weights at all depending on your fitness level. The workouts can be super hard even the warm-up can make you feel good. I also love that you can choose which workouts you'd like to do to meet your specific goals and needs. As far as the nutrition part goes, I believe that you should do more of your own research for healthy foods. It's good that she does give you tips and particular recipes but it wouldn't hurt if she had had way more than just 2 or 3. I'd recommend this!!",1312848000,2,1113,4.110091743119266

The DVD gives the user the flexibility to design their own style for the day. There are 2 different cardio components (obviously 1 is harder than the other), tums, legs, abs, arms, and bums. You can add any combination that you want to. I believe each one runs about 15 min. Then there is also a warm-up and cool-down 10 min program that you can add to each. You just select all that you want to do, it the order, hit play, and the DVD does the rest. There is a brief nutrition portion with maybe 3 recipes, but it isn't really worth watching. Even so, I highly recommend this DVD!",1310256000,2,693,4.140740740740741
3679832,5,B001L5DSMA,"wow!  mel b. is a beast!!  i love working out with her, unfortunately my cardio is too weak to keep up with her right now.  so i definately reccomend this dvd for advanced trainers.
love the nutrition sect of this dvd, i wish all trainers would include this on their dvd considering diet and fitness go hand in hand.  and as for the workouts- i love the 1-minute per move style of training.  you get pushed, but thru simplicity.
the only thing i would change is the organization: if you don't watch the beginning you won't really know who's doing what (mods and experts).  lastly, watch a few times with and without working out along with her to know when she may not warn you when your switiching to a new move immediately.
when i advance my cardio, i will report back on the difference it's made in body overall!  GOOD LUCK!!!",1307145600,2,828,4.407894736842105

I was wrong! I can't believe I actually found it comparable to some of Jillian Michael's DVDs. Mel B. shows she means business!

I was drenched in sweat in no time. Some of the workouts were so hard I actually had to pause the DVD and take a break (hopefully by week four I won't have to do this). I'm not overweight, I just wasn't expecting this level of intensity. Mel B. mentions in her introduction that this is the workout she does to stay in shape. Judging by her 8 PACK, remarkably toned buns, and the intensity of this workout I have to say I believe her.

It includes cardio, legs, butt ""bums"", abs, ""tums"", and arms. She also shares a few healthy recipes with the viewers. This workout is perfect if you're trying to whip your butt back into shape!",1294963200,2,923,4.391812865497076
3679835,4,B001L5DSMA,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

I worked up a good sweat with 5 lb weights and had to really work to keep up with some of the harder one minute rounds.

Pros:  MelB could probably make this a new career path if she picked up some fitness and nutrition certs and a bit of fitness instruction polish --- I found her a very motivating instructor.  Really liked how she largely kept up a vocal count for those exercises where you would be facing away from the TV (something that I wish every DVD instructor would do.)  Liked all the workout routines.  Rather basic but preferable to dance-y/swishy/useless fluff moves which I hate and moves are repeated enough to really burn.  Could not really hear the music which was ok with me since I usually end up not liking the music chosen.

Cons: While my muscles were burning, none of the routines ---- cardio rounds included --- was enough to get my heart rate in my target zone for more than a couple minutes.  Also, I agree with other viewers regarding the camera angles  --- very annoying.  Would have been put to better use letting us see the moves rather than all the extreme closeups of her face and anatomy.  I kept wondering --- are they trying to largely appeal to the guys?  Or do they think all the closeups of her top and abs etc will motivate the gals as something to aspire to?  In any case, I can see she looks great without all the pointless zoom ins.

Regarding the nutrition segment:  Again, with some polish, perhaps she could change careers to the food network.  For me, she came across as very interesting and watchable.",1294099200,4,1606,4.482758620689655

The segments are short and intense so it keeps my interest while still making me feel the burn. The DVD I got was in great condition. Works on all of my DVD Players including my laptop. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun with a quick workout that doesn't involve you going outside (although exercising outdoors in nature has, in recent studies, been proven to enhance mood due to vitamin D soaked in from the sun through your skin...just a little information for you).

3679884,4,B001L5DSMA,"I purchased this DVD on a bit of a whim or curiosity binge - upon discovering Mel B of the Spice Girls *had* a fitness DVD a year or so ago, I kept my eye out for it again. After reading Mel B's biography and hearing about her start as a fitness instructor, I decided to bite the bullet and just buy the thing. The good news is I was actually pleasantly surprised at the program!

There are six separate 10-minute programs (actually 2x 15 and 4x 10), plus a 5-minute warm-up and cool down. The four ten-minute programs are arms, legs, bums, and tums. In each segment, you spend a minute on each move, often rotating to work both sides of the body. The workouts are pretty old school actually - relying more on your body's movement and resistance than weights (they ask you to use soup cans or bottles of water here and there, I opt for 3 lb weights). The abs is definitely the most hardcore - be careful of neck strain!

The two fifteen minute workouts are supposedly cardio and advanced cardio, but they're almost sort of multi-muscle-group circuits. You'll find you do a number of moves that are identical to, or quite similar to moves you've completed in other circuits. Because every segment ties in constant movement and cardio, the two cardio segments should be loosely titled as such. The stream of plank moves at the end of basic cardio is death! Despite me calling these old school workouts, they are by no means easy...just different.

As for Mel B and her `posse'? She's a pretty fun instructor, as you might expect by her vibrant personality. You get the sense she's confident in what she's doing (whether the moves were fed to her or not) but she also acknowledges when something is tough and takes a breather right there with you. It's refreshing to see the trainer do the workout, and struggle as much as you may be. The setting of each segment changes, as do the fun outfits of Mel B (and to a lesser degree her fellow comrades), and the beautiful seaside setting is a nice change from the typical gym-bound DVD.

Overall I'm glad I bought this DVD. I'm not entirely confident it's quite as effective as some of the other series I typically use (namely the Biggest Loser) but the fact it's so customizable and provides a nice change of pace from everything else I do totally made it worth it. Plus spending time working out with a former Spice Girl ain't half bad either!",1269561600,3,2387,4.493087557603687
3679885,4,B001L5DSMA,"This dvd is great if you get bored easily like me. The menu is Divided into Warm Up, Tums, Bums, Arms, Cardio, Advanced Cardio, Legs and the Cool Down. You can pick and choose what workouts to do and in what order. It flows very well, Mel B is very easy to listen to and at some points feels your pain.

Like some of the other reviewers have said, she doesn't explain the work out so its a good idea to just sit and watch it first. Mel B also wears some really low cut shirts, which I thought was a little distracting at first.",1266624000,2,527,4.019047619047619
3679886,4,B001L5DSMA,"The workout led by the vivacious Mel B is a burner.  It works the muscles in your arms, legs, and abs with repitition of weights.  Which is great.  It's what I want, but it can get boring fast because the repitions are a minute long.  Doing lateral raises for one whole minute works the arms and it also tests my patience.  If I didn't feel so good and burn so many calories after the workout I'd probably not do it.

Also, it helps that Mel B is so peppy yet not annoying.  She's like your fun friend you go to the gym with who works hard and moans n' groans with you.",1266624000,2,569,4.026785714285714

I will say that this video is NOT for beginners.  I would recommend that you be in some type of shape before beginning this workout.  I have been doing 'The Shred' and threw this is for some additional cardio.
I do like how this DVD is structured where you can create your own workout and work only on what you need.
Mel B jumps right in and doesn't let up.  About 15-20 seconds before you are going to start a new move, she 'announces' it and sometimes will describe it.  She does encourage you to watch her and the others before jumping in.  Technically your 1 minute doesn't start until about 5 seconds in when she feels that you have joined it.  At one point she reminds you that when you work out this hard you want to treat your body right and eat healthy.  Heck yeah, my legs aren't going to feel like jello for nothing.  And eating will be minimal as my arms are too heavy to lift to my mouth.
Note that if you are doing multiple sections, that there is not a smooth transition between segments.  There is a pause aka a black screen for about 5 seconds before the next segment starts.  At first I thought the DVD was stuck but was thankful for the short break.
Mel keeps you going with her UK humor and expressions.  I thought it would be annoying but it was actually encouraging.  I do wish there was more instruction but while doing reps she reminds you to keep your shoulders down or your stomach tight which really does help.
Overall I would recommend it if you are already working out and want to add this to the mix.  It was enjoyable and will certainly help you get totally fit.",1247184000,5,1761,4.259036144578313

I was completely mistaken and glad of it! This workout kicked my butt and I consider myself to be in shape. As other reviewers have said, you can pick and customize your workouts (although you really should include the warm up and cool down sessions in your line-up no matter what you choose). I believe no individual workout session is over 15-20 mins. So far I have tried the warm up, cardio, advanced cardio and cool down sessions. You do very basic aerobic exercises for about 1 minute on each side (say if you are raising your right left and keeping the left stationary) or for each rep (if you are doing ab work). Its intense and does truly get your heart rate up. I really appreciate how quickly the workout moves without time for rest.
In addition, this workout is fun! Mel B has a great bubbly personality that doesn't become annoying. The backdrop is also cheery, bright and tropical, set in sunny Los Angeles, Cali by the water. The only problem I have with this workout are the camera shots from time to time. Often the camera will zoom in on Mel B's abs or her upper body, making it difficult to see what she is doing with her legs. But besides that, this gets the job done!",1244419200,2,1348,4.396

3679990,5,B001L5DSMA,"I have tried a lot of workout videos, and many of them have been disappointing in that they're not difficult enough or too short. I definitely did not expect this former Spice Girl to crank out anything extraordinary, but I was wrong! She should have been doing this back in the 90s instead of music. Seriously.

Thinking it couldn't be all that tough, I decided to do the entire workout. Again, WRONG! Mel B had my muscles burning and my heart pounding more so than any other workout DVD I've tried. 100 minutes of awesomeness. The abs section was a killer! If that's what she does to get that washboard midsection, count me in.

I only have two complaints about this otherwise fabulous workout:

First, by doing exercises in sets of reps with one leg first and then the other, the second leg in line does not get as good of a workout as the first. She always starts with the right leg and then complains that her left side is her ""weak side"". Duh. I simply alternated legs/sides and found that I felt much more balanced and was able to work out both my left and right sides equally. Also, sometimes the reps can be too fast, especially if you're using 5 pound weights like I was. I just simply slowed down the movements and it worked just fine.

Secondly, the camera guy had a hard time showing her full body in the frame. At random times the shot would be of her abs, her butt, or zooming in on her boobs, all while I was trying to see what exactly I was supposed to be doing. It was confusing and distracting sometimes, but not much of an issue considering once I figured out the moves, I was sweating like crazy in no time.

Over all, I love this workout! You only need to watch or do it once to get the hang of it and by adjusting the intensity of the exercises to your fitness level I'm sure you'll find that this workout is amazing!",1241049600,4,1840,4.29106628242075
3679991,5,B001L5DSMA,"I've had this DVD for about a month and have really enjoyed it.  I'm a mom to a toddler so I just do not have the time (or drive) to go to a gym anymore and have started working out with DVDs at home in order to stay in shape.  This is definitely my favorite for a few reasons:

* Mel is not annoying.  I've tried some other workout videos where the instructor is so obnoxious (i.e. Denise Austin) that I just can't make it through the video.  Mel is funny, motivating and she seems pretty real.  She admits when things hurt and laughs at herself during the workout - which is nice to hear.

* The video is broken up into segments: warm up, cardio, advanced cardio, arms, legs, bums, tums and cool down.  The warm up and cool down are 5 minutes and you should do each time.  The cardio segments I believe are about 15 minutes and the other ones are 10 minutes each.  In the DVD menu you can select as many of the segments as you want to do which means if you have a lot of time to work out you can do all of them but if you only have 30 minutes to you can just do a couple.

* Finally I really like this product because I can actually feel it working.  I am not using it because I want to lose weight so I can't speak to that, but I do want to be more toned and healthy and it is definitely doing that.  It is challenging but fun and I can feel myself getting stronger as I do it.

The first cardio segment (after the 5 minute warm-up) would be a good place for beginners to start.  All movements are repetitive lasting about 1 minute each, so it's easy to catch on if you get lost.  No fancy dance moves.  The second cardio segment (about 20 minutes long) is geared toward the intermediate excerciser using resistance (bottles/cans/light weights) during the segment.  There are also more high-impact moves during this segment.  One thing I wasn't to fond of was the plank/mountain climber series.  During cardio, I would much rather stay standing the entire time and then do planks during the ab sessions, but since it was only for a minute or two, I did standing crunches and side bends to keep my cardio up.
The upper body segment (about 10 minutes) uses light weights and lower body movements to tone and keep the heart rate up at the same time.  It was a lot harder than it looked, but I used 3 pound weights during the whole thing and not 1 pound cans or  2 pound water bottles.
The Lower body segment (about 10 minutes) was a series of squats, side lunges and leg lifts.  Again, I used weights to make it a bit more aerobic.
The Bums (10 minutes) and Tums (10 minutes) are both done on the floor. Your standard donkey kicks, side leg lifts, cruchches, etc.  I felt the burn.
During the workout, Mel is encouraging and I felt suffering through it like I was ;-)  She kept the talking light and not to much chatter.  I felt she could have given a bit more instruction for beginners as to how to do the exercise safely, but anyone who has done a few DVD's knows all the clues and tips.
Overall, a nice surprise.",1240272000,7,1747,4.438871473354232

That said, I'm an advanced intermediate exerciser and I couldn't make it through the entire workout - as Mel B. advises, work up to it.  Beginners might be overwhelmed and they should take it very slowly to avoid burnout.

She's very pleasant and likeable.  I dislike that Mel doesn't really identify the moves or explain how they should be done in proper form (sometimes she doesn't appear to have the proper form herself!).  He cueing is off so sometimes she was a few reps into a move before I realized what she was doing.  I guess repeated viewing will remedy that.,1237161600,5,515,4.151515151515151

3680026,1,B001L5DSMA,"I found the Warm up, the Cardio section and the ""Total Body Workout Section"" of this workout extremely boring.  I can't stand the music at all and it seemed like the counts were off with the beat as if the music were added later.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the camera work was really bad.  Even though some of the moves are basic aerobics moves, it would help if there wasn't a close-up shot of her abs or something else when the moves are changing.

The minute long exercises become very boring which makes it seem like an eternity for 1 minute.

The only part of this DVD I'll be using will be the toning segments as add-ons to my workouts.",1236816000,4,660,4.248

I have just started working out on a reguar basis, and I like that you can customize this DVD to set up which part of your body you want to work out, and how long of a total work out you want to do. It has a quick fifteen minute cardio, and you can add legs, abd, bum, arms etc. and in what order you want to do them....which I think is the best part of the video. Mel B is very engaging, funny and the work out is easy to follow. You get a really good work out.

3680050,5,B001L5DSMA,"This is my new favorite video!!  By far the most challenging, FUN, upbeat and enouraging video in my entire library.  The only thing that compares is Taebo and the only other instructer that I enjoy equally are Kelsie Daniels from The Firm (also completely in love with her Pump, Jump & Jab) and Billy Blanks.  My heart was pumping during the warm up (and I'm an advanced exerciser).  I love the variety, the scenery and her upbeat spirit.  There are may segments to choose from in whatever order you'd like and which ever ones you wish to do.  Eventhough it's tough, you actually WANT to do it.  My goal is to do the entire video at once after about 4 weeks.  I also love how she uses every day equipment (water bottles, soup cans, chair) and doing 1 minute of everything keeps you from being bored. Lots of changes - I LOVE it!!  The nutrition segment is also good.  If you go on her website (totallyfit.com), there is a deluxe video that includes Lifestyle section and secret Abs & Back workout.
I had being doing Jillian Michael's two new videos - BFBM & NMTZ which are great videos but not quite as motivating.  I was literally running to do this video after going through and watching it the evening before. As an experienced exerciser, a workout has to be FUN in order to keep me coming back to it and THIS IS IT!!",1236124800,21,1321,4.395061728395062
3680051,5,B001L5DSMA,"I've never used an aerobics DVD before but I have used a ton of dance ones.  I used to be really in shape but kinda fell outta practice and well lets just say...I could really use this DVD.

I bought it for the Mel B signing in LA and I was surprised at just how great it actually is.  The menu is nicely designed unlike every other work out DVD I've ever owned and it has the neat featured where you can select which sections you want to do in which order instead of making you do it the way they laid it out (like most DVDs).

Its pretty hardcore too!  I mean look at Mel B who wouldnt want to look like her?!?!  The first time I popped it in I barely made it through the first cardio set.  I did it again and made it through both cardios and found it was a little easier.  Its a VERY good DVD...I forsee major weight loss and toning with this.

I'd also like to add I like how she doesnt use anything complicated like other work outs.  You 'pretend' jump rope (no rope required) and use water bottles and such for weights.  Also the scenery and cinematography are perfect.  Some people have reviewed they didn't like the camera angles and found that hard to follow.  I didn't have this problem.  She usually explains what shes doing and you see her do it a few times before the camera gets fancy.  Fantastic DVD!  It could have been a really cheap silly thing to make some quick money but credit must be given: she put some thought into this.

Interesting side note for non Mel fans: before she was a Spice Girl she worked at the local gym as an aerobics instructor for a day job.  Apparently it was a very popular class...not hard to see why!",1235433600,5,1646,4.171428571428572

3680053,4,B001L5DSMA,"More like 4 1/2 stars!!

  I decided to start out with the Cardio and Advanced Cardio workouts.  Unfortunately, while beginning the cardio segment, I was starting to feel disappointed because it wasn't as intense as I hoped it would be.  I actually started thinking that I could use this workout for something to do on a ""light"" exercise day.  Silly me . . . that was just the calm before the storm.  By the end on the first section I was totally out breath but decided to continue with the Advanced Cardio portion anyway.  Yeah, I won't be doing those two back to back for a while.

A few things I didn't like:
1.  The camera angles can start to get on your nerves.  They would focus on one part of Mel B's body so you'll miss the first couple of reps on the exercises. But on the flip side, the exercises are so easy to follow that you can just jump right back into the workout.

2.  I would have liked her to give you more of a heads up when transitioning from exercise to exercise.

3.  I might be a little anal but I would have liked the cardio sessions to have been exclusively cardio and that the cool down, while fabulous, were actually slow exercises then stretches rather than just stretches.

What I like:
1.  The majority of the exercises are low impact.  This is EXTREMELY helpful when you live in the upstairs apartment.

2.  I like that Mel B. feels our pain and actually screams out during some of the exercises when it seems to be too much.  Reality check for those instructors who seem to be able to just glide through the work out.  She's very funny and motivating and right when you want to give up, she just makes you want to go a little farther.

3.  The workout has a customizable menu!  Score!!

The good FAR outweighs the little annoyances.  A word of caution:  this workout can be pretty intense.  Okay, let me rephrase that--this workout IS pretty intense.  But, hey, if this is truly the way that Mel B. works out (which is rumored as so) then, whew! it's no wonder she looks the way she does.  Of course, I haven't mastered this one yet and it seems like it may be a long time coming but at least it gives me something to shoot for. =D",1235001600,4,2164,4.269135802469136

3680055,4,B001L5DSMA,"This is a good workout DVD that includes cardio and toning exercises. The cardio is bread-and-butter moves that don't require much coordination, but can be quite high impact at times. If you've ever done a basic aerobics video you will recognize a lot of the moves, and she includes some toning moves in the cardio sections. It's mostly basic calisthentic moves with some kickboxing and yoga thrown in for good measure.  The toning sections (grouped by body part) tend to have a more aerobic feel to them as well because you don't just stand in place and do strength moves. There are a lot of reps of each move, so you'll definitely feel like you've gotten a good workout. Look below for a more detailed description of the moves.

There are 6 sections on the DVD: Cardio, Advanced Cardio, Arms, Legs, Bums, Tums. A warm-up and cooldown are included as well.  The DVD is programmable so you can choose to do just one section, a few sections or all of them in any combination you choose.

I will give an approximate breakdown of the moves of each section. You generally perform each move for a minute,and she does all the moves on one side for one minute before repeating the move on the other side.

Warm-Up: A basic 5 minute warm up with marching in place,overhead reaches, arm circles and knee lifts.

Cardio: 15 minutes

- Twist (jump for side to side while rotating torso)
- Punches
- Hamstring Curl
- Side Reach Overhead (2 min.-1 on each side)
- Mountain Climbers
- Plank Side Twist
- Spider Plank (in plank position move between being on hands and elbows)
- Push Ups

Advanced Cardio (20 minutes):
You can do the toning moves in this section without weights to make it less intense.
- Jog in Place
- UpperCut Punches
- Bicep Curls while Marching in Place (repeated for 1 min with knee lift)
- V Shoulder Raise while Marching in Place (repeated 1 min with knee lift)
- Triceps Raise while Marching in Place (repeated 1 min with knee lift)

- PushUps
- SitUps
- Reverse Crunch
- Twisting Crunch with Alternating Leg Lift

- Alternating Biceps Curl
- Shoulder Press with both arms
- Alternating Shoulder Press
- Triceps KickBack
- Side Shoulder Raise
- Shoulder Raise Combo (Up-Out-Down)

- Squat
- Squat with Knee Raise
- Squat with Front Kick
- Calf Raise in Sumo Squat Position
- Squat Side-to-Side
- Pulsing Lunge  (2 min- one per leg)
- Sitting Leg Raise (works quadriceps)

- Kneeling Heel Raise
- Lying Leg Lift
- Lying Leg Lift with Kick
- Bridge
- Bridge with ""Knee Knockers"" - can't explain but REALLY effective move for shaping the bum and getting rid of love handles.

Tums (10 minutes): You take a quick breaks because this is INTENSE.
- Basic Crunch
- Leg Climb (while lying down lift one leg in air and use abs to move  hands higher and higher on the lifted leg)
- V sit (balance on tailbone while lifting away with arms and legs)
- Torso Twist with Legs Lifted (use water bottle or weights)
- Side Reaches (with head and shoulder lifted alternate sides and tap your heels)
- Pilates Move ""The Hundred""- (keep head and shoulders lifted for 1 min while ""fanning arms""
- Hot Potato
- Plank with Torso Twist
- Plank

CoolDown: Nice, relaxing stretch.

Beginners, BEWARE this workout may be too intense for you and she does not give enough instruction to form for brand new exercisers. However, I don't think is entirely a bad thing, because every video can't be for beginners or you couldn't progress. You can work towards being able to do this entire DVD and just do the sections you are comfortable with. Watch the DVD first before performing the moves, but remember you are capable of much more than you think. This workout is weird because it's almost too intense for beginners, but it might not be tough enough for the intermediate or advanced level. You can up the intensity by adding more weight but she doesn't show modifications to make it easier.

Unfortunately, I had to take away one star because some of the moves are too monotonous and can make a minute seem like a really long time. However, the slower moves can let you catch your breath and prepare for the more intense moves. Also, I didn't like that she included toning in the cardio sections because when I want cardio I don't want half the workout to be strength moves.

Overall, I think I would enjoy this workout even if I weren't a sucker for a cute British accent. She's a very encouraging instructor, striking that happy medium between being too peppy and too dry. Mel B. cues well and usually tells you what move you're going to do in advance. She does throw some unique moves in the mix and I think the abs and lower body toning sections are especially nice and effective. Basically, if I can look like her after I have two children I will do this workout for the rest of my life, so try it out if you really, really want to. :)",1234224000,11,5634,4.39673390970221

The choreography is not complicated, the steps are very simple to follow so you won't get lost in the shuffle of the program. The dvd is set up so that you can choose at the beginning of the menu which exercises you want to do. This is fantastic, because the program runs almost seamlessly and you don't have to lose momentum by fast forwarding to the section you want. But most of all, Mel B is TERRIFIC!
