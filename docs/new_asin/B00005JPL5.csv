1584198,1,B00005JPL5,"The reviewers above had just said what I felt. We went to watch a kids film, and left the theater with a feeling of a hole in our chest and surrounded by astonished sad kids and crying moms and dads. What a horrible experience is watching this movie. You really have to be masochistic to like these kind of stories. No fantasy or imagination film whatsoever, just a brutal movie that leave as if you had been to a funeral. It is really cruel for the producers of this film to advertise this as a kids film.",1171756800,,506,4.22680412371134
1584199,5,B00005JPL5,"when i was younger, i had to read the book in class. to tell the truth, i never payed attention to it. i just remembered the ending.

well, afterwards, i grew to know more about it and learn it and when i say there a movie, i couldn't be more excited. i quickly read the book before the movie..which i hadnt read in like 5 years :D! and went and saw the movie tonight.

my opinion is half and half. i looved the book. but the movie, i'm not so sure. don't get me wrong..its amazing. and i liked it. but i really wish they would of made is a lot more like the book. there were so many small..and BIG details that i picked up on that were missing (especially the ending about lesli).. and some that were added in there..like the keys and leslies shining blue purse.. wierd! didn't know where they got those ideas.

but if you think about it, it was made for kids. so of course its going to be extremely imaginative. although it was great. seeing it come to life was so exciting. i just really wish they would have followed the book to the T! anyways..its a must see!

but... definitely read the book before.",1171670400,,1105,4.19811320754717
1584200,5,B00005JPL5,"Bridge To Terabithia is one of the best children's fantasy films in decades. It's comparable to The Neverending Story and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Explorers/dp/B0002V7O3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Explorers</a>, a couple of my favorites from the '80s, and in my opinion it's even better than Chronicles of Narnia, though I don't expect many Narnia fans to agree. This one doesn't have too much fantasy, just a few sequences from the imagination of the two child protagonists. But the story around that is profoundly moving with useful lessons for the whole family, including a practical demonstration of a Teddy Roosevelt quotation: ""Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing,"" - and much more.

I've seen over 4,000 movies, includig at least 3 or 4 new ones a month, and this is my favorite in years, certainly the best in the past six months (my favorite last year was The Prestige), and I like it more than Harry Potter, because it's more serious. I see other reviewers making much of the fact that a movie has a sad part. But what's sadder is that so many supposedly adult viewers can so thoroughly miss the point of any movie with a message more complicated than ""bang,"" or think children can and should be shielded from the knowledge of death by censoring it from all fiction.  Think of how many wonderful books or movies would be spoiled -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Dog-of-Flanders/dp/B00007M5II/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Dog of Flanders</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Girl/dp/0800177991/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Girl</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tree-Grows-in-Brooklyn/dp/B000QBA2GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Courtship-of-Eddie-s-Father/dp/B00008MTY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Courtship of Eddie's Father</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Remember-Mama/dp/B0004Z322O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Remember Mama</a>, Bambi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-of-the-Galaxy/dp/1416505520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen of the Galaxy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Borrowed-Time/dp/6302593360/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Borrowed Time</a>&nbsp;- just to name a few off the top of my head.

The cast is terrific too, with the lovely Zooey Deschanel (Elf) as the teacher, and, really getting the point across with exceptional acting, Josh Hutcherson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Manhattan/dp/B000E6ES9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Manhattan</a>), Anna Sophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie), and Robert Patrick (The X-Files).  The fact that some critics were so affected by the death in the film is a testament to the effectiveness of the movie, especially Hutcherson's acting, as well as that of Robert Patrick and Anna-Sophia Robb (there's no actual death scene in the film, so it's really Hutcherson's reaction that's so affecting).

By the way, if you enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Manhattan/dp/B000E6ES9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Manhattan</a>, this one has some similarities including the same fine acting by Hutcherson and some brief special effects sequences representing the children's imagination -- though this is more serioius and somewhat sadder.",1171670400,8,3680,7.649411764705882
1584201,5,B00005JPL5,"On the surface, the concept for ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is quite sad: it centers on two adolescents, both of which are lonely and misunderstood. They then bond and create their own fantasy world, one that reinterprets the harsh realities of their daily lives into extraordinary creatures and settings. It's very easy to think that such escapism isn't healthy in a relationship, especially in one that's formed during such a dynamic and turbulent stage of development. But there's so much more going on here, so many different themes, ideas, and commentaries that are at work. This is not a light and airy children's fable of princes and princesses, nor does it attempt to sugarcoat everything that's even remotely unpleasant in this world. This is an incredibly powerful story of friendship, the fortitude of the imagination, and the strength to overcome adversity.

The first of the two adolescents is Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson). He doesn't exactly live an ideal life; not only does his family barely live from paycheck to paycheck as farmers, they also virtually ignore him. Going to school is even worse; he hasn't any friends, and he's at the mercy of a couple of school bullies. One sits behind him in class, yelling things like, ""Beep! Beep! Beep! That's my loser detector!"" Jesse has two forms of escape. One is running, which he hopes to perfect so he can embarrass anyone who gave him a hard time. The other is drawing; he carries a sketchpad wherever he goes, and he frequently fills a page with fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes, and colors.

The second adolescent is Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a free spirit in every sense. Because she was able to run faster than any of the boys, Jessie initially feels threatened by her. But then the class is asked to write a one-page essay on their favorite hobbies. The teacher asks Leslie to read hers aloud due to her fluid, descriptive language. Both Jessie and the audience immediately understand that the teacher made the right decision; as she reads an incredibly mature and creative essay on scuba diving, he visualizes what she's describing. Fish swim in his eyes. Bubbles exit her mouth and float away. At that point, the connection is made; she expresses herself through language while he does so through art. Both rely heavily on their imaginations. These two were meant to be in each other's lives.

In wanting to escape the monotony and pain of the everyday world, the two run into the woods, swing across a rope, and create a world of their own. Leslie calls it Terabithia, a magical kingdom imprisoned by the elusive Dark Master. She and Jessie have been sent to free the Terabithians and restore peace. At first, Jesse has a hard time visualizing this fantastic world. But then Leslie gives him a piece of advice: ""Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open."" Suddenly, everything becomes clear, not just for Jessie, but for the audience, as well. They incorporate an abandoned tree house and the surrounding trees and animals into their world: the squirrels and birds become minions of the Dark Master (interestingly, these evil creatures say things like ""Beep! Beep! Beep!""); the dragonflies become the army sent to protect Jessie and Leslie; the trees become gigantic trolls.

They retreat to this world as often as they can, despite the demands of school, family, and everyday living. This is something Jesse's father (Robert Patrick) has a difficult time understanding; while he is at heart a good man, having bills to pay and a family to feed leaves no room for an imagination. He wants his son to get his head out of the clouds and pay attention to his chores, his homework, and the welfare of the family. At one point, Jesse misplaces his father's keys; when they seem to be permanently lost, the only option is to replace them all and buy a new set of locks. This prompts his father to shout, ""Why don't you just draw me some money?""

Leslie's parents (Latham Gaines and Judy McIntosh) are interesting; like their daughter, they have active imaginations and spend most of their time writing. Surprisingly, having so much in common hasn't brought the three of them together. If anything, it's driving them further apart; her parents are always too absorbed in their work to notice her. This isn't to say that they--or Jessie's parents, for that matter--are bad people; I never once got the sense that they were willfully neglectful, despite not being as attentive as they should be. I saw them as people so wrapped up in everyday life that they've forgotten how to actually live. For this reason, Jessie and Leslie are viewed differently; their minds are transcendent.

Truth be told, transcendence is one of the movie's most important themes. Consider the character of Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton); she's initially portrayed as a good-for-nothing bully, pushing everyone around for no reason other than because she can. She steals people's food. She charges admission to the bathroom. She unfairly accuses Jessie of things he didn't do. At first, we're not supposed to care about her. But then Leslie hears her crying in the girls' bathroom. After some coaxing, she finally works up the courage to talk to her. As it turns out, Janice is a deeply hurt soul, the product of an abusive father. I won't say whether or not this appeals to Janice's better nature, but I will say that the willingness to explore such an issue makes for a deeper, more satisfying experience.

Despite everything I've been saying, I fear that this review hasn't succeeded in conveying just how amazing ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is. It's amazing as an examination of the connections certain people make. It's amazing as a testament to the endless possibilities of the imagination. It's amazing as a message to think freely and to not be bogged down. We need this kind of film in our lives, if not for the sake of entertainment, then for the sake of being emotionally rejuvenated. I find myself going back to Leslie's advice: ""Close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open."" Not only do I urge you to see this film, I also urge you to follow that piece of advice as you watch.",1171584000,18,6142,4.832699619771863

The Disney's and Director: Gabor Csupo's version is trying to be more than the book and came up with an artsy film that is better than most of the trash that we feed our kids today. The only problem is that the professional artsy people can do it better and the people that go for mindless graphics and fairy tail endings will not appreciate this film; it is sort of pearls before swine.

Trying to be subtle, we get nether graphics enough to make this a moppet movie or the lack of graphic making this a philological escapist story. The images are not confined to Terabithia but to Jess (Josh Hutcherson) himself. Of course Zooey Deschanel can bring out the graphics in any of us; be sure to see her again in ""The Tin Man.""

Bottom line a fairly good formula movie but not designed for the mindless. And there is nothing exceptional or surprising. When Val Lawton had to use titles like ""I walked with a Zombie"" and made it into a physiological thriller, Csupo snuck a physiologic thriller right under Disney's nose.",1509321600,2,1105,4.575757575757576

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Family films that deal realistically with friendship, imagination, isolation, and childhood dynamics are few and far between. When it does happen, they often go overboard to a crushing realistic style that results in something that is an ordeal to sit through. BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA film drama adaptation of the 1978 Newbery Medal winning young-adult book by Katherine Paterson, strikes the right balance between the two extremes.

The film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA stars Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick. Here we find two young outsiders, that includes Twelve-year-old Jesse Aarons [Josh Hutcherson] who befriends a new girl at school named Leslie Burke [AnnaSophia Robb] and the pair begin to create their own imaginary kingdom in a secret place in the woods to escape the difficulties of their real lives and find sanctuary in a world of wonderful imagination in this charming film fantasy, that an emotionally rich testament to the life-changing power of friendship. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are wonderful as young misfits Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, who are drawn together by their mutual alienation and delightful creativity.

After an awkward introduction, they become inseparable, inventing a magical imaginary kingdom known as Terabithia and is a homage to C.S. Lewis's world of the Chronicles of Narnia in their local woods, which to them personally it is there magical empire full of fabulous excitement and imagination. This attractive magical realm and its fantastical creatures provide a showcase for a wealth of enjoyable digital effects. Yet, ironically, it's the duo's mundane daily experiences and the way their secret exploits gradually empowers them at school that are the story's greatest strengths. In his debut film as a director, Gbor Csup tackles pre-teen issues with both wit and sensitivity, while the film's unexpectedly tragic turn makes the final segment particularly affecting. Together, they spend a wonderful and exciting time in the realm of Terabithia that is until Leslie one day crosses the bridge to Terabithia alone.

Holding pretty close to the books plot outline, fifth-grader Jesse Aarons [Josh Hutcherson] draws and runs to escape the world where he feels like an outcast and he is the only boy among five children, his father Jack Aarons [Robert Patrick] struggles to keep the familys  financial head above water and has no time for the seemingly unproductive activities his son pursues, and the school bullies pick on him for being poor, distracted, and artistic. The only allies Jesse Aarons has are his cute as a button younger sister May Belle Aarons [Bailee Madison] who adores him even as he shuns her company and his music teacher Ms. Edmunds [Zooey Deschanel] who encourages his artistic side.

Jesse Aarons seems destined for a childhood as an outsider until the arrival of new female friend Leslie Burke who is totally opposite to Jesse in many ways but her independent attitude and style also put her on the outs at school and Leslie Burke recognises Jesse Aarons as a kindred spirit. This is the kind of family film that can make you think about kindred spirits without throwing up. The two become very close friends and Leslie pushes Jesse Aarons to use his imagination to create a land in the woods near their houses, which they dub Terabithia.

The scenes in BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, where Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke briefly battle creatures which echo their struggles at school and home, is the movies only fantasy element. The rest is firmly rooted in the reality of school yard and home-life troubles, familiar to anyone who didn't quite fit in during these formative years. Jesses relationship with Leslie, does not become a romance but a true friendship, gives him confidence to do what he enjoys while facing down some of the roadblocks in his life.

Director Gbor Csup, a long-time animator, takes the helms on this feature length film for the first time. Its almost amazing since the strength of the film is not in the special effects, although the sequences are important to the film, and some say the special effects themselves are slightly cheesy, but I totally disagree, but again director Gbor Csup puts a lot of effort mainly into the performances and relationships with the real life characters. Every character is given at least a few layers. The father is not just a tyrant, but a loving man at the same time who is trying to be practical about what is important in life, the school bullies and teachers have their own problems, and Jesse acts selfishly at times despite all that Leslie has done for him. The realism in these characters overshadows the occasional poorly rendered hawk creature in Terabithia.

For those looking for sword fights, mythical creatures and grand themes of revenge, then the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA will seem slightly tame, and some might say even boring. But for every film advertised as being about friendship and imagination this film actually seems to understand what the words really mean. Like the book, the film expects that a well told story about self-expression, being yourself, and the joy of being with someone who both likes and challenges you. The special effects of the film are quite imaginative. While I wouldnt say there is anything technically landmark about them, they are artistically very cool and especially when you see forest creatures turned into fearsome imaginary creatures, trees turned into trolls, and much more. If you like special effects or fantasy, you will want to check this out without any hesitation.

Also very ground-breaking and startling in a family film for 2007 is the willingness to handle religious themes in an even handed way, especially about the existence of God, Jesus, the afterlife, and the joy in searching for an answer in open minded way. The dialogue, spoken extremely well by strong young actors like Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb is very enlightening no matter what the age of the viewer. The film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA should please all fans of the book and especially anyone that likes fantasy films, you will definitely want to view this really excellent Blu-ray disc. Also please note that the film takes a rather dramatic turn towards the end like many beloved childrens novels often do. I don't want to spoil it for you here, but that twist, may be more appropriate for older children. One thing is for sure, as near the end of the film you will definitely want to get hold of the Kleenex tissues, as you definitely shed a few tears of sadness and joyous fulfilment of seeing a film that covers all types of emotions and knowing you have seen a film that you will want to watch time after time.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Home Entertainment Blu-ray disc presents us again with a continuously successful 1080p very sharp image transfer on the highest level, as well as the usual excellent 1.85:1 aspect ratio. It also boasts of a generally very pleasant picture quality with a very good depth of field effect. It also boasts of great crisp colours thanks to some good brilliant contrast image presentation. But some hues, particularly oranges and greens look slightly over-saturated, giving flesh tones a sort of waxy look that only shines with the close-up shots. On the plus side, detail is quite strong, blacks are nice and solid, and make no mistake overall, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA looks really excellent and so once again the Walt Disney Home Entertainment have done a top notch job.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This Walt Disney Home Entertainment Blu-ray disc presents us the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA not only convincing in terms of the picture quality, but it can also claim almost the entirely a number of high points with a brilliant 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound acoustically presentation. The dialogue track is extremely clean and crisp. The surround audio mix is filled with wildlife that truly comes alive that we get to hear a very nice mix of sound, which can especially show in the fantasy scenes in the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Especially in the scenes the composed film music score and but also the sound effects combine to great effect, but never really aggressive sound field. Even so, here the depth of the bass sound is used to good effect and quite effectively. The scenes in reality, on the other hand, are more front-heavy, but thanks to the perfectly recorded voices, they have also been very successful all round presentation. So all in all the soundtrack is also top-notch and truly brings us to believe in the land of Terabithia.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary with Director Gbor Csup, Writer Jeff Stockwell and Producer Hal Lieberman: Here we are first introduced to Gbor Csup, the director of the film, and informs us that he is sitting next to Hal Lieberman and Jeff Stockwell, and also says that they are going to have a lot of fun talking about the film, which are all glad to do so. One of the commentator said he saw a preview of the film, that did not have the credit sequences in the start of the film, but eventually saw the finished film and was knocked out by what he viewed. They say that they wanted to show at the start of the film we are viewing now to show that Jesse Aarons is really living in a different world from the rest of the family who do not really understand his way of thinking, which they find his outlook very alien. Although the film was filmed in New Zealand, they wanted to give the impression it was set in America. When you see for the first time the classroom, we are informed that about 90% of the children are New Zealanders, but had to re-dubbing the voices the children who speak to sound American. Also when you see the race in the field, if you look very carefully a lot of the children in the background are native Mori. When you see the two children climb to the top of the tree and see in the distance the land of Terabithia, with the mountains, the river, the waterfall and the birds in flight, this was all created by CGI Computer Generated Imagery. When you see Josh Hutcherson carry the animal caught in the trap in the greenhouse, they point out that you can tell the film was shot in New Zealand as the big possum in the trap is native to New Zealand, whereas the a possum in America is totally different. When Josh Hutcherson stars to see The Dark Master running parallel to him through the wood and finds out that it represents his Dad, which eventually you see them together and when you see Josh crying, this was real tears. Throughout the film we are informed that certain families and crew members appear in the background. As we get near the end of the film and Josh takes his little sister across the Bridge to Terabithia and the Terabithia wood people appear, the very large troll, as well as the castle in the background, and we are informed that this was all produced by CGI Computer generated imagery. As the credits and the beautiful drawings roll up the screen, the director thanks us for joining them in watching the film with the audio commentary, and hoped you enjoyed all of their comments and was I felt this was a very nice audio commentary and one I know you will also enjoy listening to their comments and a very nice bonus towards a really wonderful magical film experience and definitely gets a five star rating.

Audio Commentary with Actors Josh Hucherson, AnnaSophia Robb, and Producer Lauren Levine: When we see the Walt Disney Castle appears at the start, both the young actors thinks it looks cool and wants to visit it. But as the actual film starts, first up to introduce themselves is Lauren Levine, and next up is Josh Hucherson, and finally AnnaSophia Robb. Both young actors saw the first preview and thought it was cool, but finally saw the official released film and thought the start of the Title was even cooler and so much better. They talk about the actor Robert Patrick in acting so hard in the film, but then the cameras stopped rolling they both said he was one of the nicest people you ever met and was so kind to everyone. When you see AnnaSophia Robb wearing the coloured woollen items on her arms, we are informed they are actual socks with the ends cut off and when the film was released every teenager especially in America had a craze for this style of item to wear at the time. When you see the squirrels attacking the two children in their secret tree house, well we are informed that there are no squirrels in New Zealand and they were of course created by CGI computer generated imagery. When the little sister says her lines, we find out that at the time the little girl could not read, so someone stood just beside the camera and read he lines out loud, which of course immediately repeated instantly, but after the film was released had started to read. As we get to the end of the film and the film fades to white, you hear all three clap their hands and cheer and the producer says, Well done. We also hear that there is a spelling mistake in the end credits, which you have to wait a very long time and when we finally get to see the wrongly spelt word, which is Squorge and should be Sqougers, but they do not mention what the right spelling is. As we get to the very end all three of them thank us for sitting through their audio commentary and say goodbye. As a passing thought, I thought this audio commentary was sort of okay, and definitely not as interesting as the first audio commentary, as the three of them did not do as interesting information about the film, and was just ordinary general stuff of what went on when the director shouted cut. Of course it was not all bad, and of course it would be entirely up to you whether you would be interested enough to sit through this particular audio commentary and sort of get a sort of three star rating and it was a good job the producer was there to hold it altogether, as if it had just been the two young actors, I should imagine there would have been a great deal of silent gaps, as they would of run out of anything to say.

Special Feature: Movie Showcase [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:04] Here you get instant access to the filmmakers most cinematic moments from the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA that showcases the ultimate in High Definition picture and sound. As usual, you can either watch each individual film clip or Play All.

Special Feature: Behind the Book: The Themes of Bridge to Terabithia [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [14:29] Here we get teachers and even some cast and crew members praising Katherine Paterson's book ""A Bridge to Terabithia."" The teachers really hit on the subject matter in the book and how important it is to teach young children the values that Katherine Paterson has instilled in her book. My favourite part of the feature is Katherine Paterson herself talking about the book and relating to different aspects of the film. What is also nice about this special feature is that you get to see a few clips from the film that relates to what people talk about the characters in the film. Contributors include: Ilene Abramson [Director of Childrens Services at Los Angeles Public Library], Mrs. Leanne C. Marquez [Teacher at Kornblum Elementary School, Hawthorne, California], Zooey Deschanel [Ms. Edmunds], AnnaSophia Robb [Leslie Burke], Nonie Smith [Adjunct Professor of Childrens Literature, California State University, Dominguez Hills], Melissa Messener [Children's Librarian at Manhattan Beach Library, County of Los Angeles Public Library], Katherine Paterson [Author], Josh Hutcherson [Jess Aaron] and David Peterson [Producer/Screenwriter].

Special Feature: Digital Imagination: Bringing BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA to Life [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [5:56] This is a very short feature highlighting the making of the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA and the Visual Effects behind it. Sadly it is far too short to offer a substantial examination of the films intricate special effects, but it sure manages to provide some very interesting moments, but it definitely needs much more time to delve into the material provided. Despite the length of the special feature it sure packs in a lot, as you get to view some basic line drawings, stunning illustrations, rare behind-the-scene filming as well as some basic computer generated special effects. Contributors include: Katherine Paterson [Author], Lauren Levine [Producer], David Peterson [Producer/Screenwriter], Gbor Csup [Director], Cary Granat [CEO of Walden Media], Josh Hutcherson [Jess Aaron], Dan Lemmon [Visual Effects Artist/Supervisor], Richard Taylor [WETA Workshop], Michael Pangrazio [American Art Director for Visual Effects], Matt Aitken [Special Visual Effects Supervisor] and David Clayton [Lead Animation Supervisor at WETA Digital].

Special Feature: Music Video: AnnaSophia Robb: ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open"" [2007] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:37] ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open"" is a song written by Dave Bassett and Michelle Featherstone and featured in the film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. It is sung by American actress AnnaSophia Robb, who plays the character Leslie Burke in the film. A portion of the song is heard playing over the radio during a scene where family is celebrating Jesse's birthday. It was released as a single and peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90. Here you get to view the actual music video that was originally shown on the Disney Channel to promote the film.

Finally, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a fantastic film. I absolutely fell in love with the two characters as they created a personal world together, and a place where they can get away and become whatever they can with their imagination. I was absolutely drawn into the story in every way. The film BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is not only one of the best family films of 2007, it is also one of the finest film adaptations of children's literature. I highly endorse BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA to anyone looking for a great glimpse into a child's imagination. Highly Recommended!

So if you, or your kids, aren't ready for a mostly normal world movie you can skip this one. Thats not to say it isn't good, because it is pretty good. Good enough that i don't see why they felt the need to sell it as something its not. The story is fine. All of the acting is good, especially for a cast of mostly kids. The effects were good for the time. My only complaint is they went for the my girl thing for an easy emotional pull.

It's a nice movie for anyone in your family. It stars Josh Hutcherson  of The Hunger games and AnnaSophia Robb of televisions The Carrie Diaries.  Both actors are a bit young, as this movie is seven years old.

The movies theme is one of friendship, imagination and loss.  It made me cry my eyes out but my daughter loves it.  She has watched it three times since it arrived.

I'm really glad we ordered this and in co inclusion it's a great family movie but might be a bit sad for younger children or older mommies :)",1459209600,2,762,4.347517730496454

I have not read the book yet, so I was under the impression that the movie was going to be a bit moody, scary at times, and sad, but I think ultimately it is a great movie to watch. I don't think it is very sad or scary. I think it teaches lots of lessons about how you can develop your imagination, share with friends, and appreciate your friends that you have for what they are. While the story is quite moving, I think when you are looking at the message in general you kind of separate yourself from the specific episodes of the movie, and look deeper, and that is what I really liked about it.

1585431,3,B00005JPL5,Watched with my 10yr old. This movie starts off with a good theme but then becomes ridiculously depressing. My daughter cried for  a long time and made me just as sad. Disney is ridiculous sometime with their stories.,1453161600,,217,4.7105263157894735

1585486,3,B00005JPL5,"Really wanted to like this more. Growing up I had some friends who called our secret clubhouse-by-the-highway Terabithia, and it was years before I learned of the book and heard They'd adapted it.

The film is decent in execution, but I think the story just doesn't lend itself to the medium nearly as well as it does to literature. No mysterious lack of decent performances or hackneyed performers trying to reinvigorate their career with a film on ""controversial"" subject matter. It's all at least acceptable.

It just never really clicked into place properly for me.",1451606400,,569,4.978947368421053

I wasn't looking forward to this movie since book-to-movies normally end up causing massive headaches, but this was actually a pleasant surprise. It was written a while back, so they did modernize it a bit, but stayed as true to the story as possible, I think. The creatures of Terabithia were beautiful and creative. The lessons woven in were well played and memorable. Overall, this was a great family-friendly movie complete with all sorts of ups and downs.

The only thing that I really hated was how May Belle said ""Tera-Bithia"" at the ending. I don't know why, but it always makes me cringe. ):",1410825600,,677,4.633333333333334

She is going into a new school and the first assignment was to read the book...500 pages in one week. She was somewhat stressed. The movie helped get her calm and remembering keys themes. Key themes were solid and perfectly understood by her: friendship, love, sacrifice, grief. Now in my family imagination is paramount. With an imagination one can solve any problem; with imagination one can dream dreams. Imagination is vital to the human condition, and we make sure that our children and grandchildren are well equipped with it. This story also comes so close to my own childhood beginning with the building of the tree house and then the bridge. Even the rope was over our swimming hole and with each year got closer to the water. I would put this movie along with our favorites: The Never Ending Story, Willi Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Princess Bride. All are must haves; and all should be revisited annually. This will compliment our collection.",1408492800,2,1181,4.737864077669903

1586724,5,B00005JPL5,"My students watched the movie in increments as we read the novel. They enjoyed both the novel and the the movie. They noticed where the movie stayed true to the novel, shifted the order of events, put dialogue in different characters' mouths, and the imagination that went into making Jess' drawings come to life. Seeing the movie as we read increased student understanding and involvement as measured by the depth of the questions they asked and the discussions that followed.
Delivery of the DVD was on time as promised and arrived in excellent condition. It was a good experience all around.",1402185600,,594,4.891089108910891

She also told us she had already watched it three times that week, so I was really afraid.  Nice story dealing with some tough issues, there is an element you need to be prepared for - nothing graphic, just a ""life issue"" that we all face.  It was handled very well.  I then texted my daughter and told her that her niece and I were watching a movie that she and her daughter (my other granddaughter) might enjoy.  She texted back that she had read the book as a child and remembered crying her eyes out.  Then, she said she was excited to watch the movie.  So there ya go - just have a hanky handy.",1401840000,,774,4.217687074829932

1586781,5,B00005JPL5,"The task of devising a story that gives children hope in real-life situations is a daunting one. Each of our children face adversaries on a daily basis in their neighborhoods and at school. This amazing story celebrates a child's capacity to sort through these types of problems from within the combined world of fantasy and daily life. It is truly a tale that acknowledges a child's perspective and captures their indomitable spirit.

Kudos to the author and screen writer who so effectively express *children's ability to stand their ground while treating an adversary with compassion; *a child's unique aptitude for understanding their parent's perspective; *children's need for allies when among peers and family; *misunderstandings turned to empathetic gifts of understanding.

YEP - Kudos to this movie and all it expresses!",1401062400,,830,5.376923076923077
1586782,3,B00005JPL5,The book is so good. I don't understand why screenplay writers take so many liberties when adapting the book to film. They changed a lot and added things that weren't there. I'll never understand why they don't just include more of the book than creating new story lines that never existed in the book. I'll have to watch the old PBS version from the 80's to see if that stays truer to the book.,1400630400,,395,4.351351351351352

1586784,1,B00005JPL5,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I took three little boys to view the movie without any previous knowledge other than it got rave reviews.  The first half of the movie was splendid.  Half way through the film the heroine of the story is killed off!  The jolt to the audience was audible.  I looked at all three little boys and they were crying.  Why in the world would one kill off the central protagonist in a children's story when that story is intended for very young boys and girls?  It's inexcusable and cruel.  The second half of the film was a jumbled mess because the anchor character was no longer there.,1400025600,2,632,4.3418803418803416

I thought it was just some fantasy adventure movie for 10 year olds, but the character development and direction of the story was much more profound and moving.

I was hoping that my childhood love wouldn't deceive me and I would still love this movie and it worked! For those who haven't seen it, it's a fantasy/action movie. I won't give any spoilers but it is about a young boy and girl and their ambition to find a place where they can be comfortable and have fun. This is later called Terabitihia. The movie makes you laugh, makes you cry, and makes you feel good all around. I would especially recommend this movie to a younger audience but if you're an adult and you enjoy a good children's movie, this may work for you as well.",1392854400,,716,4.195652173913044

Although I loved it, there were ways in which it didn't live up to the amazingness of the book. The parents were more likable in the movie; it left out how the dad thought drawing was effeminate, and how the mom favored the teenage sisters. What the movie did so well was to capture Terabithia. The squogles (imaginary squirrel monsters) were fabulous.",1385856000,,512,5.035294117647059

All of the lines came across as staged, the story was seen more in individual elements instead of the overarching theme, I didn't care about what happened to the characters, etc. The list could go on.

1587240,2,B00005JPL5,"This movie started out seeming as if it were going to have a moral of you can do anything with enough imagination which is what I thought was going to be though out the movie. I have not read the book so did not know the story. That was not exactly the case, to a point yes but there is a sharp turn in the movie toward the end. We enjoyed the bulk of this movie but toward the end where it takes it sharp turn it lost us and we have never watched it a second time. I would not recommend it for small children there is some stuff that is way over their head and will likely just upset them or confuse them at best.

(spoiler alert* stop reading if you do not want to know what happens in the movie)

I would not have let my small girls watch this movie if I had known that the girl was going to up and die in the end in a stupid accident that should not have even happened. The whole thing seemed forced and just plain awful to me. It just seemed like they killed the character off for shock value (I do not know if she died in the book or not or if the author of the book did it for the same reason of shock value or what I can only speak toward the movie) I just felt that it was not necessary and I hate movies that get you invested in a character only to kill them off in the end in a stupid 'did not do any good other than to upset people' type move. sorry.... this is not a movie that has ever left the shelf a second time in our house in the last several years since I first got it.",1376870400,5,1489,3.8

If you can imagine having both your legs cut off by a freight train right after being accepted into the world Olympics, then I guess you might appreciate the message. just way too real with a tragedy that only happens to one in a million, so why suck us all into it. A horror movie is one thing but this is a horror movie disguised as a family movie. Don't get me wrong, there is no violence whatsoever in this movie, but horror nonetheless.
I would like to thank the makers of this movie for making me the most depressed I have been in years. You totally and brutally TRICKED me into witnessing someone's worst nightmare come true.
I just don't get it. sorry.
Some will argue that the story is a valuable teaching to young viewers on how to handle the death of a loved one. True, young people will eventually need to face that, but not this way! Let it happen when it happens in real life so that they are not alone in their hurting.
Maybe the book handled the outcome more sensitively, I don't know, didn't read it, but I do know the movie used shock tactics to it's fullest. And I'm sure there are plenty of viewers who enjoyed that but there are also at least as many people like me, I think most of them just don't talk about it.
For anyone as blown away as I was by the ending, may I suggest watching Because of Winn-Dixie as soon as possible (also starring AnnaSophia Robb) to help lift your spirits back up, especially for younger viewers who may have been traumatized by this tragedy.

WARNING -- plot giveaway following...

A note for the writers of this film...
How can you take a young innocent new actress like AnnaSophia Robb who is such a beautiful inspirational spirit and kind loving person, and use her to make a movie that makes you wish there were more people like her in the world, and then kill her?? What can that possibly be good for except to put a huge profit in your pockets? This movie could have ended with a valuable message for this messed up world, and instead it reinforces how even the best things in life can suddenly be snuffed in an instant. Total about-face from where the story was going.
Nothing like opening people's hearts with a beautiful hopeful story and then blowing a hole through it with all you've got.",1376265600,3,2393,4.3752808988764045

1587344,5,B00005JPL5,Good Family Movie.  Includes some fantasy.  but does include tragedy ....Finishes with a positive outlook.  Made me laugh and cry,1374883200,,129,5.35
1587345,4,B00005JPL5,"The book is awesome, and the movie is a fun way to reward kids who have read the whole thing.  The only thing is that you will probably need a permission slip if you're doing this at school since it's PG.  The reason it's PG is that it touches on the mature topic of death and bullying; there's nothing inappropriate, unless your little ones think the fantasy stuff is scary.
When I taught the book, most of my kids had already seen the movie, since it is a modern film.
The thing about Terabithia is that it's a place the boy and girl made up, and all the CG fantasy stuff is a visualization of what the kids are imagining.  If you see the movie before reading the book, you miss that part.  It is advertised as a fantasy like Narnia, but all the fantasy is what the kids imagine.
If you look at the bad reviews, you just see people who didn't like the sad ending, or who were expecting more fantasy.  Obviously they didn't read the book.  Keep in mind that originally the book was written in the 70s, when life was very different.  The movie does a pretty good job of *showing* you e book, but they do change a few things, including the setting.  It has a very sad ending, the same as the book, so make sure your kids can handle death being a theme.  I would have given it five stars if it had stuck more closely to the book, but overall I understand why they changed a few things.
To summarize the plot, the little boy hates his life, then he meets the girl, who is new to the school.  They get bullied at school so they find a little hide-out in the first and imagine all this fantasy stuff; it's not literally there, and the CD graphics are just to show you what they imagine.  They go to Terabithia several times, and the story shows you the boy's sad life, and how he finds a few positive things to help him get through it.  I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but it *is* sad, so don't show this to little ones expecting a feel-good happy ending.
You should probably talk to your kids, in fact, about issues like death and bullying.  This is reality, and we need to face it.  Plus, read the book first, because it has so much more to offer.  Just remember, the setting is the 70s in the book.",1374364800,,2202,4.1725768321513

1587353,5,B00005JPL5,"Bridge to Terabithia is a work of children's literature about two lonely children who create a magical forest kingdom. It was written by Katherine Paterson and was published in 1977 by Thomas Crowell. In 1978, it won the Newbery Medal. Paterson drew inspiration for the novel from a real event that occurred in August 1974 when a friend of her son was struck by lightning and killed.

Bridge to Terabithia is the story of fifth grader Jesse Aarons, who becomes friends with his new neighbor Leslie Burke after he loses a footrace to her at school. Leslie is a smart, talented, outgoing tomboy, and Jesse thinks highly of her. Jesse is an artistic boy who, in the beginning of the novel, is fearful, angry, and depressed. After meeting Leslie, Jesse's life is transformed. He becomes courageous and learns to let go of his frustration.

The novel's content has been the frequent target of censors and appears at number eight on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books for the decade 19902000.[1] The book is studied in English studies classes in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States.

Bridge to Terabithia has been adapted for the screen twice: a 1985 PBS TV movie and a 2007 Disney/Walden Media feature film.",1371945600,,1292,4.91743119266055

I'd read a couple of reviews, but most seemed to concentrate on the ""creatures"" in the film.  My kids don't scare easily, so I thought we'd be fine.  Clearly I should have read on, or looked for a spoiler review.  The tragic twist was way too much for my 5 & 7 year old to handle.  Some kids may be ok with it, mine weren't.

One of the reasons why I wanted to watch this movie was because of Josh. Zooey Deschanel, from New Girl, was also in this movie, which made me happier, though she didn't have a huge role in it. This movie is definitely amazing, this movie should had been praised a lot more then it was, I think it should have even been nominated for an Oscar, for best picture or something.

Disney has a way of taking classic tales and distorting them into happy, loving, little stories that completely ignore the underlying issues, but with Bridge To Terabithia they didn't do that. This movie was fantastic and every bit as impactful as the original story. The young leads are terrific, the movie is visually appealing, and the story is left virtually untouched.

1587776,5,B00005JPL5,"(Note: This review is for adults seeing the movie ""Bridge to Terabithia"" for themselves.  This is not a review of a children-oriented feature film.)

There is an ever-present question.  In all of the equations that you can confront or consider, the constant, unresolved symbol is you.  It never goes away.  It is easy to regard, yet it is the most-often-forgotten factor.  Answer this question, and most mysteries will vanish.

In ""Bridge to Terabithia"", Jess and Leslie are portrayed by the actors Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb.  The context into which they are placed is grim.  Jess' father works two jobs (running the family farm and working at a hardware store).  Later, he takes on additional weekend work and presses Jess, a fifth grader, into picking up the slack by doing extra chores.  Jess is quietly stoic, yet inwardly longing, when he sees his father doting on his little sister.  For Jess, the only fatherly attention is a gruff command to do his chores, and belittlement of his budding artistic talent with the admonition to ""get your head out of the clouds"".  Both at home and at school, Jess endures discomfort and struggles for acceptance.

Leslie makes no pretense about fitting in.  She enjoys life and carries herself with the self assurance of an enlightened middle-aged person, as if the wrong soul has been trapped in the body of an almost-teenager.  She represents a mythical sprite who has to make the best of her lonely existence in a world inhabited only by ground-crawling mortals.  Well, not completely lonely, because we see that her parents are themselves perfect icons---writers of fiction, financially comfortable, free spirits.  They signify the exact opposite of the dreary existence that threatens to imprison Jess.  And through their proxy, Leslie, Jess will experience the tortuous liberation that life has in store for him.

The movie is make-believe, and it is about surrendering to make-believe.  In the end, Jess finally surrenders completely.  He is transformed from follower to leader.  And he realizes the nature of art.  It is composed of surrender paired with sharing.  His proselyte, and his salvation, is the character of his younger sister May Belle.  His training, begun with Leslie's opening a door, ends with his sharing his discoveries.

And, really, who is being trained?  Why, you, the viewer!  The movie is about the tensions that bind and strain and shape your view of reality.  Jess, on the threshold of adulthood, is being shown that growing up does not mandate the loss of the inner child, playfulness or natural creativity.  It is a warning that, while maturation implies the assumption of duties and responsibilities, one would do well to find a balance between this and the childlike joy of being a conscious entity in this world.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" enjoins us to open our minds.  It does so by stirring the emotions, raising expectations, and leaving issues unresolved.  We are made to believe that a beautiful angel will lead us out of darkness and into a magical world of our own creation.  This is only allegory, however.  Each of us who desires to elevate our souls in this way must become both the miraculous angel as well as the faithless seeker.  If we can do this, then, as Jess finds out in the end, we can transform our self-teaching into the teaching of others.  Salvation and healing come about not by seeking a greater truth for ourselves, but by reaching out in recognition that the ultimate transformation is helping other angels to be born.",1354233600,,3533,4.945578231292517
1587777,2,B00005JPL5,I watched this movie on the cable. It has good graphics but the plot and the story are pretty confusing. The girl who played the Leslie character did a good job. Other than that there is nothing much to watch...,1353888000,,211,4.3

I studied Ingmar Bergman in college and still hold the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and DePalma in the highest of regards. I like to think my  favorite movies are artsy and challenging, but darn it, this movie had me crying like a baby!  And I just couldn't shake the after-effects the next day and had to recount to my friends (and myself) just how powerful this movie was and how it ""got to me"".  Maybe because it is such a coming of age story, and I felt every creak and groan of Jesse's growing pains and identified 100% completely with what he was going through.  I'm not sure how this all translates to children viewers, seeing that I was reduced to mush by the end.

My fiance always asks me what I like about a movie and so of course he asked me what I like about this one...and all I can say is it's magical and you are watching the way people live every day...Jess isn't rich and he doesn't live in a giant perfect house, his family is just like your normal family complete with siblings fighting over little things all the time, his father has a real job where he works hard for very little and Jess has no friends. He is very talented at art but his parents really could care less..and then he meets Leslie who is the complete opposite...and they form this bond that you know would last forever.

1587829,5,B00005JPL5,"I had never read Katherine Paterson's YA novel of the same name and when I came across this DVD at my local library, I was captivated by the synopsis and decided to view it with my seven-year old daughter.

The film adaptation is beautifully done, and most of the credit goes to the two young stars who play the central characters. Fifth grader Jesse (Josh Hutcherson, who was also in [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura (Special Edition)]) lives out in the country with his parents and four siblings (two older sisters who could not give him the time of day, a baby sister, and a very young Bailee Madison playing eight-year-old May Belle). Jesse's family barely scrapes by on the meager wages brought in by his dad (Robert Patrick) who works at a hardware store and also grows vegetables which he then sells to make ends meet. Jesse's relationship with his dad is tense because the older man is strict and consumed by his own financial worries. Jesse is also a loner at school, finding himself without any real friend. Jesse's only solace is his art and portfolio of drawings.

Then a new family moves in next door and Jesse's entire perspective on life changes. Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) is lovely, confident, and possessed of a sunny disposition. There's nothing that fazes this young girl, not the resident school bully, a surly eighth grader, nor anyone else who tries to ruffle her good nature. Soon Leslie befriends Jesse and the pair find they are both blessed with great imagination. The pair find their very own refuge from the outside world in a part of the woods that seems to have been forgotten by the rest of humanity. Here the pair really give free rein to their fantasy and imaginations, creating a hideaway in a magical land they nickname Terabithia.

Inevitably, harsh reality intrudes in the form of tragedy, and the rest of the story focuses on how one of the main characters forges ahead despite grief and a sense of loss. This heartwarming, inspiring, and heartbreaking story makes for wonderful family entertainment. My daughter and I had an interesting discussion after the movie ended about some of the themes in the movie such as compassion, empathy, and friendship.

Rather than be disappointed, we were thrilled at the depth of the story and performances.  Our 7 year old LOVED it, despite the sadness and difficult turn the story took.  She found it to be a ""beautiful movie"" (her words) and she asked that we keep it an extra night so she could see it again.  She especially liked when the boy became more sensitive and closer to his sometimes ""annoying"" little sister at the end.  She said that the bridge and his sister would help him to feel better about things.  She couldn't be more right!

A must see.  A movie that will teach compassion and caring to our young children.  Not an easy movie at first glance, but parents should NOT be afraid to have their child see something with a bit more substance.  Kids see enough mindless movies, fantasy for the sake of fancy computer graphics, adventure movies that teach nothing other than it's fun to be pirate.  This movie has soul and depth and feeling, and I wouldn't have missed it for the world, and neither should you!",1306972800,,1126,4.465686274509804

1587909,1,B00005JPL5,"I made the mistake of watching this with my 6-year-old son, and really regret not having screened it beforehand. I thought it'd be a fantastical romp through an imaginary world, but I guess I was duped by the advertising. The fantastical makes up about 2 minutes of screen time.

While the actors were all terrific, the story itself was a wretched depiction of the real world as a cheerless place filled with nasty children and uncaring adults -- not a great message for kids.

Spoilers follow, so those of you who still want to suffer through this thing, read no further.

Leslie, the charming, free-spirited new girl in town, befriends our protagonist Jesse, a depressed kid who's constantly picked on at school. Naturally, having seen this plot a hundred times before, I knew Leslie would be dead by the end of the film. No charming, artistic, free-spirited and friendly child is allowed to survive in a film like this. (I thought she'd be done in by cancer, though.)

There's also a ton of Christian soul-searching, which I was totally unprepared for. After his friend dies, Jesse is wonders whether she will be damned to hell for not believing in God. And his dad's lukewarm response is something like ""I don't think so, son.""

Further, the movie makes it seem like most children are complete bastards, and that adults don't care. There's also a weird thing where Jesse's teacher whisks him off on an unauthorized field trip with no permission slip. Talk about fantasy. Try doing that in the real world without losing your job!

I suppose I'm to blame for not screening this thing beforehand, but again, it was sold to me as something entirely other than a tragic after-school special.",1305331200,6,1690,4.790378006872852

1587911,1,B00005JPL5,"The Fantasy here is that this is advertised as a fantasy.  That's like saying the Nazis were goodwill ambassadors.  I threw it in the trash after I watched it.

Maybe the producers and I have a different definition of ""fantasy"".  A general rule of fantasies is that you don't kill of your heroine right in the middle of the story.  That's not a fantasy, that's real life.

Whoever gave this movie 5 stars is either on the production staff, relatives of the child actors, or mentally disturbed.

Yah, lets all go have fun watching a movie about people dying and call it a ""FANTASY"".  Get the popcorn.  Maybe they'll make another fantasy were more good people die.  Make it real ""real-like"".  Maybe have an airplane crash into a school.  A real fantasy.  Make you feel real good inside.  Heeeey! That dude died reeeeeal good!  That was fuuuuuun!",1287273600,3,843,4.639455782312925
1587912,4,B00005JPL5,"First off let me start by saying READ THE BOOK! It's a great read and its pretty short, and it is a story that you should allow your own mind to create before you watch the movies interpretation.  However, having said that this movie is still pretty good and very close to the book. There are however a few drawbacks at least in my opinion.  Let me mention the good in this movie first, the cast is well chosen and they win you over pretty quickly.  The score is wonderfully created especially during the more sorrowful filled moments in the film. The story is amazing and honestly whether it be a major motion picture or a high school play I think in some way you would find yourself connected.  There were however a few things I felt kept this movie from being in the upper echelon of films.  The acting at times can be a little off, I don't mean the actors/actresses were poor just the delivery of the lines and emotion were odd. A bigger issue for me was the CGI created Terabithia world in which there imaginations are shown on camera.  My problem with this is it was done simply to draw the younger audience with its flashiness. It would have been more charismatic to make the implications of their imaginations and allow the audience to use our imaginations as well. My next issue again has to do with their desire to draw in a younger audience and that is at several times during the film a song is played while for 2 mins we wait around watching just some fill simply so that kid songs can be put into the movie to again draw a younger audience.  This completely breaks the rhthymn of the film in my opinion.  And along these lines the scene where they're painting the house and dancing is terrible.  It is just such a reach to have us believe this as part of the story when it seems like they're making a music video.  However with all this being said I urge you to watch this movie because when it counts everything comes together and really impacts you in a way most other films can't compare. I guarantee you won't simply walk away from this one. No it will stay with you for a while you will find yourself thinking about life and how fragile a thing it can be.  So READ IT then WATCH IT then REMEMBER IT because i don't think you'll be able to forget this one.",1285113600,,2274,4.302107728337236
1587913,5,B00005JPL5,"This movie has a young man (Jess) who is searching for something, and obviously struggling and pained though he tries not to show it. He meets Leslie, his next door neighbor and fights her offer of friendship when she reaches out to him. He can't resist forever though, as he is won over by her fanciful charm and tender friendship and they build a wonderful kingdom made of imagination that they live in and reign together. When they are separated tragically forever, Jess puts some of the deeper more important things in life in action that he learned from Leslie and becomes what she would have always wanted him to be, causing her to live on forever in spirit even after her being tragically lost forever. My cheeks are always tear stained when I watch it.

It's too childish and slow for most adults and it's too sad for kids, especially younger ones. The storyline and ending are a huge downer. There isn't really anything cute, funny or witty about this movie. It is also billed as a ""fantasy"" which as other reviwers mentioned is false advertising. This is a DRAMA, not a fantasy movie. Any fantasy scenes are short, probably not even 10 minutes out of the whole movie.

The story seems like a ripoff of the movie ""My Girl"" only the genders of the kids are reversed and there are a few unimpressive fantasy scenes thrown in which do nothing for the plot other than drag it out. The one big difference here= The movie ""My Girl"" had a plot, had better acting, better character development and it had some humor and realism to balance out the sad ending. I don't mind a sad ending if the story was worth it. The Bridge to Terriblebithia isn't worth it. It is a tragedy of a movie with an equally tragic ending!",1283644800,8,1053,4.372448979591836
1587975,4,B00005JPL5,"What more can I say that hasn't been said? Bridge to Terabithia is based on a much-loved children's book and essentially sticks to the spirit of the book. First thing to know is that this movie is NOT a fantasy tale. Apparently the promoters thought to take advantage of the ""from the makers of the Narnia movies"" and market the movie as such. While there are fantastic elements they are all just visualizations of a child's imagination. With that in mind the CGI effects that bring the fantastic elements to life are not the showcase of the movie, which is a good idea. Now that we have that out of the way on to what the movie is really about.

This is a coming of age story at its core. The main protagonist has a tough life in his eyes and throughout the movie he learns things that end up changing his entire view on it. When you are 10-11 years old your enemies are simply kids and teachers who are mean to you. Your pain is not getting the attention of your family. Your tribulations evolve around day to day challenges. What BtT shows is how a young boy's friendship with a free-spirited girl starts opening up new possibilities for his life. Nothing grandiose or epic like saving the family farm or making the winning shot in a game. This is all internal. Jess (the young buy) realizes there is more to those kids who pick on him and learns to understand why. He also learns some hard life lessons.

This movie isn't all cutesy with kids playing in the forest with no cares on the world. Sure there is a level of escapism, but it is put in its appropriate place in time. As the movie progresses things get serious... just like life. The way this segue is handled is what makes this movie worth it. Characters evolve and grow in the movie right before your eyes. The ending felt a bit stunted to me as if it didn't really address or resolve what the movie was setting up. But then again that's how life it. You take it one day at a time.

The acting in this movie is top notch. Josh Hutcherson convinces you he is a kid lost in angst yet hopeful of something better. AnnaSophia Robb nails the role of his sprite-like companion. Robert Patrick plays the distant dad that doesn't know how to show love to his son with such subtlety and heart he continues to keep me interested in what part he's going to play next. Lots of good performances all around from both the child and adult actors/actresses.

Production values looks really high on this film with effective cinematography, nice music (although I could do with a little less of the pop music stuff) and good pacing. The CGI looks pretty good all things considered... until you get the end of the movie. I dunno if the animators got lazy or if the films $30 million budget dried up, but the final CGI scene looks very out of place in regards to how it interacts with the real world footage. The CG characters were neat and all, but the whole thing just didn't fit right. Considering that production budget and what they did accomplish on the movie as a whole I can forgive the limitation. It's just very noticeable.

This Blu-Ray is in 1080p using MPEG-4 as the video codec on a 1.85:1 aspect ratio (no black bars on widescreen HD tv's?). The nature scenes look great in HD. The audio is uncompressed 24 bit PCM, which is about as true to the source audio as you can get. This is a great surround mix too. The extra features are a little sparse if you're the type that expects a lot of goodies in your Blu-Ray. Here's a run down:

Audio Commentaries - One with director Gabor Csupso, screenwriter Jeff Stockwell and producer Hal Lieberman. A second one with producer Lauren Levine and actors Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb. Haven't heard the commentaries. Will update if I do.

Behind the Book: The themes of Bridge To Terabithia - A series of interviews with the writer of the book and the producer of the movie (who happens to be the same person the original book was written for) as well as a host of others. They essentially give you some light light about what the book (and movie) are about. Not bad, but not engrossing either.

Digital Imagination: Bringing Bridge To Terabithia to Life - A quick featurette touching on the special effects of the movie and WETA's involvement. Not a lot of meat on this one either, but it is informative.

Keep Your Mind Wide Open - Disney styled music video performed by AnnaSophia Robb. Interestingly enough this is the one standard definition extra... coming in at 480p instead of 1080p.

Movie trailers - Lots of them that want to come in and start before you see the movie. I hate when Disney does that.

This is a movie for kids between 8 and 12 for the most part. At least they are the ones that will get the most out of it. If you have youngsters about that age and want them to experience a movie that can show then how to see the world with a more open mind then Bridge to Terabithia is right up your alley.",1282521600,2,4924,4.405940594059406
1587976,5,B00005JPL5,"This isn't a typical review, but I think it might be useful for some people. Have you ever heard a song from your childhood and experienced an intense emotional reaction?  That's how I've always felt when someone mentioned the book Bridge to Terabithia.  I read many books as a child, but that one deeply impacted me.  I feel a wistful, deep yearning in my heart just thinking about it.  When the movie came out, I think my son was in third grade.  I strongly believe in having children ""read the book first""; he patiently slogged through each Harry Potter book before he watched the movies.  In this case, though, I didn't feel he was emotionally ready for Bridge to Terabithia, so we waited. Additionally, I was concerned when I saw that they had incorporated CGI fantasy elements to make it more modern.  It's not a fantasy; it's a drama.  Honestly, I thought they might have ruined my book!

He finished fourth grade in June, so I decided it would be a good time to try it out.  He read the book earlier this summer, and he cried a lot.  We talked about the book together, and he was in a funk for a day or so, but he really liked the book and said he was glad he read it.  He just watched the movie today, and again, he was very emotional.  He said he was okay, and didn't need to talk.  A few minutes ago, I noticed that he was watching it again.  I asked him why.  He smiled, still looking a little sad, and said, ""Mom, it's just so good.  I think it's the best movie I've ever seen.  I could watch it over and over.""

I almost started to cry myself, because I knew that he had gotten it.  The characters in Bridge to Terabithia are 10 or 11 years old.  This movie is truly for children of that age.  It's not for five-year-olds.  It's not for 15-year-olds.  My child had a powerful experience watching this film, so I'm giving it five stars.  However, I would never let a young child watch it; a young child would be bored for most of the film, and then very distressed for the remainder of it. If you're an adult who didn't read the book as a child, you might think the movie is so-so.  If you haven't read it, do it before you watch the film.  It's short; it should only take a few hours for an adult to read.  It might take you back to your childhood.  It takes me back to mine.  :)",1281657600,2,2293,4.192660550458716
1587977,5,B00005JPL5,"Bridge to Tarabithia is a difficult film to review. It begins as a story of two lonely children on the brink of adolescence. Jess, played by Josh Hutcherson, loves to draw but is inhibited by the reality of life at home and in school. Leslie, played by AnnaSophia Robb, is new at Josh's school and quickly shows a great sense of imagination.

Since they live next door to one another in a rural area, they decide to go exploring. By using a rope swing over a creek, they find a fantasy world that Leslie names Tarabithia. The film shows us the children at home, at school and in Tarabithia. They find all sorts of magical creatures in Tarabithia, and repair a treehouse that they find there.

The film, though, is not about its special effects. It is about the two special children who discover the magic of Tarabithia.

At this point of the film, it has rightly earned the 5 stars that I have given it. But then, without any warning, a tragedy occurs. The tragedy occurs off screen, but is no less wrenching because of it.

The filmmakers were faithfully reproducing the story as told in the book (which I have not read). And the tragedy was apparently based in an incident in the author's life. But the tragedy takes the very heart out of the film. It tries to recover its magic but cannot. Watching the film after the tragedy is to experience grief unredeemed. The bridge to Tarabithia seems only an empty gesture.

There are good performances in the film by Robert Patrick as Josh's father, and by Zooey Deschanel as an inspiring music teacher. The performance of Josh Hutcherson as Jess shows the conflict that his character feels.

The best reason to see the film is AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie. Her performance is luminous, and she shines as brightly as any star.

It is difficult to recommend this film for children. The first part of the film is charming, and filled with magic. The second part is simply too tragic for young children to comprehend. I must admit that I had difficulty comprehending it myself.",1277424000,3,2016,4.598885793871866

If you have little kids, don't let them watch it, it's definitely not a kids movie.

Great acting job though by AnnaSophia Robb and cast. Would have been a great movie if the ending didn't suck so much.  Now that I know the ending, I sure am glad I never read the book and have no plans to get it.",1277337600,16,570,4.053571428571429
1587979,5,B00005JPL5,"""Close your eyes, and keep your mind wide open""

The second half of this sentence (keep your mind wide open) is the theme of BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. I make this point right at the beginning because it is the heart of the film. Whether or not it is the main theme of Katherine Paterson's original book, I do not know. But it becomes the main theme of this wonderful Walt Disney produced version. It's a theme that is not handed down in a preachy melodramatic way but simply and well thought out. And the film brings the magical possibilities of the book brilliantly to life with special effects that do not overpower the story or the characters.

Characters and story were central to the original book and co-screenwriter David Paterson (the son of the original author) understood this. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) lives with his mother, a strict father (Robert Patrick), and four sisters, including May Belle (Bailee Madison), who he looks at in the beginning as a real pest. He also feels jealousy to May Belle because the father pays more attention to her than to him. Bullied and picked on by his classmates Scott Hoger and Gary Fulcher, and his school's 8th grade bully Janice Avery, Jesse retreats into a world of cartoon drawings, and practices running to prepare for a race at school. He also enjoys his Friday music class with Ms Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel).

Everything changes for him when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) and her parents move next door. Leslie is an intelligent 10 year old who loves to read and write stories. But she becomes an outsider as well when she first beats all the boys in the race, and reveals that her family doesn't have a TV. The bullying in the movie is wisely used not to create sympathy for these two children but to depict the world they live in. Exploring the woods in the back area behind their houses, Jesse and Leslie create their own magical kingdom, where they can be whatever they want and no enemy can defeat them. Their kingdom is called Terabithia, and it is where Jesse learns the amazing possibilities that can happen, by keeping his mind wide open.

It is here in Terabithia that the special effects come to play, along with a fascinating opening credits sequence where pencil sketches are practically drawn onto the screen. Trolls, squirrel-like creatures, evil vultures, and odd but amazingly inventive creatures inhabit Terabithia. The effects are created by WETA-Digital, the same FX company behind ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, and the film was shot on location in New Zealand. There is a master shot of the land of Terabithia that is just plain breathtaking. The advertisements focused on these special effects instead of the story, and that looked to me like a wise marketing move.

A tragedy happens in the film just like it happens in the book. And in this tragedy the film does not get soppy and gooey, but stays true to the theme. Virtually every character is affected by this tragedy and even Jesse's father finds that he has to look at the relationship with his only son in a different light. A final conversation he has with Jesse is powerful and moving. I had the sense watching this film that keeping his mind wide open is something he has started to realize. The conversation makes Jesse think about his relationship with May Belle. These are two special touches that are not really looked at in the book but add perfectly to the film's theme.

I should add another wonderful element in this movie. Zooey Deschanel demonstrates the same beauty and charm she illustrated in both ALMOST FAMOUS and ELF. She also has a wonderful talent with music, and leads the music class in terrific and even catchy numbers. Deschanel's Ms Edmonds is someone who has always kept her mind wide open and admires Jesse's artistic talent. Jesse develops an attraction to Ms Edmonds, but the movie wisely doesn't make that a centerpiece.

That said, Disney's big-screen adaptation of BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is a terrific film that families can enjoy together. Whether or not you're a huge fan of the classic story (I read it when I was a kid and always loved it), you can enjoy this film not just as a movie adaptation but as a film itself.",1275955200,3,4193,4.712141882673943

Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope.

The Movie looked very good too, the river the two kids crossed was very tranquil looking with the sun coming down on it and the CGI was used very sparingly which was nice, Other reviewers have also pointed out that the movie was advertised as though it were a special effects laiden fantasy film like the ""The Adventures of Narnia"" or somthing like that whcih was,nt the case.

1588014,1,B00005JPL5,"Many have complained that ""Bridge to Terabithia"" was falsely advertised. They are correct. There is actually very little fantasy in the movie. And if that's the reason you sat down to watch this movie, it is especially disappointing because you keep waiting for something bigger to happen--and it never does. Really, it's just two kids running through a forest and imagining that giant squirrels are chasing them.

I'm actually surprised at all the raving reviews. I personally thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was a terrible disappointment; the plot flow was bad, and the story seemed to keep going in circles with no real point. There was potential there, but it never came to fruition. I am sure this was a fine book, but Disney really did a terrible job here.

Because I kept waiting for a grand fantasy world (did I mention that doesn't happen?), I grew more and more bored as the movie progressed. At this point, it becomes easy to nitpick at the flaws in the story. Like how the school, its students, and its faculty seemed to be in some kind of bizzaro world where teachers turn a blind eye to some very obvious physical bulling, well-behaved kids are falsely accused and punished because adults will apparently believe any child that has a scowl and dark circles under their eyes, and female teachers take their male students out on a ""special private field trip"" over the weekend. Yeah. I would have glossed over the inconsistencies with reality had the story been decent. Unfortunately, it was not.

Now, of course, the big ""plot twist."" I thought the movie was just plain mediocre up until this point, but this one really took the cake. I am not opposed to character death, but in the context of this movie's plot (and again, I'm sure the book did better justice to this), that plot twist was poorly done, meaningless, and very depressing. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how so many others have enjoyed this movie so much. It's really shocking to me.

Either way, view this movie at your own risk. Obviously, many have enjoyed it. Although it says ""children aged 7 and up,"" I honestly would only bring older children who have a decent handle on death and are NOT expecting to watch the Chronicles of Narnia. This is not a ""feel good"" movie, nor is it very fantastical. It also has a horrible pop-rock song awkwardly stuck in one of the scenes that would have done better without it. So if you don't mind a broken storyline, poorly placed abstract themes that never come together, and a depressed mood at the end, then be my guest and pick this one up.",1254009600,7,2589,4.633986928104576

It's all the more tempting to build a castle in the air, and move in. This is what ten-year old pals Jesse and Leslie do, in this beautifully detailed retelling of Katherine Paterson's juvenile classic, about the power of imagination, friendship, family and loss.

Jesse (Josh Hutcherson)  is one of five children and the only son in a semi-rural working-class family struggling to make ends meet. He is just beginning to explore the wonders of the artistic world, about which he initially knows very little. He is unhappy at school, despondent at home, where his harried father, played by Robert Patrick seems to want to pay more attention to his younger sister. About the only oasis in the hell of middle school for him are music classes led by Ms. Edmonds ( Zooey Deschanel), who comes in with her boxes of musical instruments every couple of days.

And then a new family moves in down the road from his school bus stop, and Jesse meets their only child,  Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) who is just as dreamy and imaginative, but slightly more confident. They are still the oddballs, among their peers, and one day they cross a stream on an old rope swing and discover their enchanted world, which Leslie names ""Terabithia"". They repair a ruined tree-house and people the woods with creatures of their imaginings... creatures and monsters derived from the real-life bullies and monsters of the schoolyard.

The special effects are applied delicately in this production and with a sparing hand. The creatures of Terabithia are elusive, almost half-seen out of the corner of the eye. Most of the movie takes place in the real world anyway... the world that Terabithia and the friendship they share in it empowers them to face with increasing confidence.  It is what enables Jesse to cope with the hurt of Leslie's accidental death, about three-quarters of the way through the movie. The very subtle point is made that the adults in Jesse's world; his father and mother, the stern English teacher, and even Leslie's parents are not unloving and inattentive. Rather, they are inarticulate and taken up with the immediate cares of their own lives.  All in all, it's a beautiful, confidently well-constructed movie, about children who seem like real children, not smutty-mouthed midgets, and the sometimes harried and all too human families they are loved by. If you are not weeping into a handful of Kleenex by the time the titles roll, ask someone send over a pint of the milk of human sympathy to your table.

The extras in this DVD release are lavish, including a set of commentaries by director Gabor Csupo, writer Jeff Stockwell, and producer  Hal Lieberman, and another with the two young stars, and producer Lauren Levine. There is also a  music video of the theme song ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open"" sung by AnnaSophia Robb. She plays a child of ten convincingly in the movie itself, but in the video can pass as an elfinly pretty woman of about sixteen. She may be the next Lindsay Lohan, but with talent. The feature ""Bringing Terabithia to Life"" is a fascinating close-up of the computer animation work that went into the creatures of Terabithia, not least because it allowed the viewer to actually take a closer look at them than was afforded in the movie. It also gave a good overview of the original conceptual sketches. The second feature ""Behind the Book"" lagged in some of the brief interviews with various fans and authorities in the genre of children's literature. I would have really wanted to see much more of the interview with the book's author, Katherine Paterson. Her insights and comments would have been several times more authoritative and worthwhile, and, should rightfully have been the major portion of this feature.",1243900800,3,4021,4.908689248895435
1588022,5,B00005JPL5,"This is one of the best family films I've seen in a very long time. It was only because I was familiar with the novel that I DVR'd the film. It had been awhile since I read the novel, which was about 14 years ago when I was in the 6th grade. So I vaguely remembered the plot and ending, but that really didn't prepare me for the range of emotions I went through as I watched this film. Perhaps not having read the novel in awhile, I didn't have a overly-critical analysis of comparing the book to the film. But, regardless of how you feel about the film's accuracy, this film stands very well on its own as a coming of age tale.

AnnaSophie Robb is perfectly cast as Leslie Burke, and I'd also agree with several reviewers that she plays the sort of girl you'd wish you were best friends growing up. She and Josh Hutcherson, playing Jesse, have very good chemistry and their discussions really should dig into some thoughtful thinking for adults as well. And so when the critical scene in the film occurs, well... you really feel for the characters.

It's on that note that I challenge some of the reviewers who have criticized this film for being too mature for kids, and too juvenile and campy for adults. I'm an adult, and I really enjoyed this film. And I know I'm not alone.

I knew this film didn't focus on adventures in Terabithia, but rather using fantasy to escape a harsher reality. Thus, it didn't bother me that the CGI effects were low-rate.

The point of this review is to suggest that while there are some mature issues discussed in this film, many of the best novels for young adults involve mature issues. Harry Potter involves death and violence. Narnia involves death and very violent images. To Kill a Mocking Bird involves discrimination and rape. Parents shouldn't insulate their children from these issues by protecting them in some sort of bubble. These are the sorts of issues that children are curious about. I know when I was young, I was also deeply disturbed by the themes in the novel. But at the same time I was also curious and had endless questions. But, see that's where good parenting or mentors come in. To give perspective and to allow us to face these issues.

This movie deserves better than the 3 1/2 star rating on Amazon. If it can make me think long and hard, it should do the same for young children. And unlike Hanna Montana or whatever crap kids are watching these days, there are real, serious issues that are dealt with in this film.",1243296000,2,2482,4.482300884955753

It is about a poor boy named Jess who lives out in the country.  He constantly gets picked on at school and is a loner.  He gets a new neighbor, Leslie.  Her parents are writers.  They became best friends and spend most of their time playing in a made up world called Terabithia.  When tragedy strikes, it is really shocking and will make you cry (I had no idea it was going to happen).  I think parents should be aware of what happens before they let their young children watch this movie.  It might be tough for some to handle.

Bridge to Terebithia is two movies: a sweet and tender story of friendship based on the classic novel, and an unwieldy CGI creation that sits at right angles to the main story rather than enhancing it; the movie may still appeal to children, but as an adult I found that the special effects dragged on far too long and severely hindered the film.",1233446400,,364,4.515151515151516

Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is beginning a new schol year, and spents part of the first morning running around his family's farm. His father Jack Aarons (Robert Patrick) works at a hardware store, and also runs the farm, and is also strict as stern. Jesse has 4 sisters, and he is the only boy out of the family. The new school year brings Jesse 2 teachers, if he has more, the others are off the screen, they are Mrs. Myers (Jen Wolfe) and music teacher Ms. Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel). The first day also brings a new classmate, a girl named Leslie Burke (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's AnnaSophia Robb), who also enters a race that Jesse has been trainning for. But they soon become best friends, along with being neighbors. There are also 2 bullies at the school Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton) who even stands outside the women's bathroom, and charges $1.00 just to use it. Growing tired of their home, and school lives, Jesse and Leslie creates their own world, which they become rulers of, which they name Terabithia.

Bridge to Terabithia was anything but light fantasy. I'm glad I watched it alone - crying over movies is more my wife's domain, and I did plenty of sniffling. I don't see this as being a kids' movie - nothing terribly objectionable, it just hit hard in spots I didn't have when I was a kid. The acting is very good - a good thing. Despite the trailer it was all about the characters and the story. There was comparatively little CG - no Star Wars or Lord of the Rings here. Just enough CG to support the story. Very tastefully done.
My only disappointment is two bits of dialog, unnecessary to the story, that portray the usual Hollywood stereotype of Christianity. Disappointing, but not surprising, even from Disney.
Aside from that one minor nit, I don't remember being hit as hard (in a good way) by a movie since I saw Apocalypse Now in the theater in 1979.",1230940800,3,1043,4.4375

This film set great examples of how children who are not as popular or a little different are treated. We have all heard ""kids can be cruel"" and this movie shows that along with so many others.
After watching the movie, I talked with my 8-yr old and let him ask me any questions about acceptance, bully-situations and anything else.
Disney did an awesome thing making a movie to show how two unlikely kids became great friends and through the use of imagination, artistry, and written word they lived in their own world that no one could take from them.
This movie encourages kids to be themselves... be proud of who they are and where they come from. It's not all about ""fitting in"" and doing what the ""in-crowd"" does. Peer pressure can get you into more trouble than kids know.

1588164,5,B00005JPL5,"I disagree with the opinion that this film is not for children. Our children have watched this film more than once and it has taught them (and me) something new every time they view it. It becomes an important lesson in living...living each moment and taking nothing for granted. It teaches them about companionship, compassion, loyalty, trust, fairness, equality, the Golden Rule, the importance of parenting, family, dreaming, striving, overcoming obstacles, the cruelty of discrimination and indifference - all critical lessons of becoming fully human and alive. I ask myself why these key qualities of the film would not be good for a child and come up with nothing. One should not wait till he or she is an adult before learning such life lessons. This film is presented in such a way that, with parental care and interaction, introspection and processing feelings can be shared with the utmost care for those who want to view the film.  There is nothing ugly or distasteful about this film. It is an accurate account with respect to the circle of life we will often experience sooner than later.  Children want truth and they become stronger, less cynical and more trusting when it is presented to them with the dignity and respect it deserves.  Films that should be unfavorable for children are those with foul-mouthed language and sexually obscene content. This film respectfully conveys the realities of life that we often wish away until it is too late for the so-called grown up who, in actuality, never really grew up at all! This movie is stunning and deserves to be seen by all, though with parents who are actively present during the viewing to discuss their children's feelings with them following the presentation.",1226880000,2,1731,4.962068965517242
1588165,4,B00005JPL5,"The advertisers and composers of the trailer for this film did a great deal of disservice to ""Bridge to Terabithia"" when they likened it to ""Narnia"" and some of the other YA fantasies out there.

While there is a fantasy element in this story, ""Bridge"" is more about the harsh reality of growing up--and being different in the harsh 'playground world' where sameness=comfort and acceptance.

Jesse (Hutcherson) doesn't fit in.  He's a growing boy in a household of four sisters and poor to boot.  So he's got to wear his sister's hand-me-down sneakers with pink stripes and he definitely catches it from the guys.

He finds friendship with the new girl, Leslie Burke (Robb), who may be able to outrun him, but has similar problems with being different when she discloses she has no television after an essay is required based on a TV show. Together, they explore the woods behind their next-door homes and build a world of fantasy only they share.

While you do see trolls and other creatures, the story is more about kids imaginations than made-up worlds.  ""Bridge"" is a lovely tale and another step kids need to take to adulthood.

I would not advise this film to parents with really young kids--and even those contemporary to Jess and Leslie may have some issues with some of the subject matter (death).  The story is well worth a family viewing and may well be a treasured favorite for some for years to come!

The screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and co-written by David Paterson, the author's son, so the film remains quite faithful to the spirit of the book. The director, Gabor Csupo, handles the emotionally charged story with skill and sensitivity, which only heightens the impact of the events therein.

Jess Aarons has two passions in life: drawing and running. He draws so that he can escape into a world of his own, so that he can escape the demands of his stern father and constant harassment from his sisters, and the bullying he endures at school. He runs because he wants to be the fastest boy at his school, which in his eyes is the only way to win the respect of his peers and his father. But his dream of being the fastest runner is dashed to pieces when his new next-door neighbor, Leslie Burke, beats him in the race on the first day of school. At first, Jess holds a grudge against Leslie. That changes when he discovers her free-spirited nature, which earns her the reputation of being weird. Together, Jess and Leslie create an imaginary world where they can be themselves without fear of social ostracization. They become the closest of friends and they look out for one another. Still, their friendship differences sometimes cause conflict. Jess' family is large and is struggling financially, while Leslie's family comprises only of her parents and her and they are wealthy, and Jess' family goes to church, but Leslie's doesn't. In spite of these differences their mutual respect and admiration blossoms into innocent, unconditional love. However this time of happiness is intruded upon by a horrible accident, which leaves Jess angry and questioning his faith. He is ultimately strengthened by his friendship with Leslie, and he begins to reach out to other people, even those that he never would have before.

It's unfortunate, but when Walt Disney Studios and Walden media advertised this film, they presented it as being a fantasy/adventure film. This is hardly the case. Bridge to Terabithia is a family film about the problems of life and the inevitable and painful lessons we have to learn in order to grow. It's a film about childhood innocence and the loss of that innocence, as we mature into adulthood. But most importantly, the film is about letting your imagination carry you away from your troubles just long enough for you to find the solutions, and about letting your love free you from your fears. Bridge to Terabithia is a film that will move its viewers, both the young and the young at heart.
The story is propelled by the talented cast, especially Josh Hutcherson as Jess, AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie, Robert Patrick as Josh's father, Jack and Zooey Deschanel as Josh's teacher, Ms. Edmunds (whose beautifully emotive blue eyes illuminate the screen in every scene she's in).

The DVD includes these bonus features: Digital Imagination featurette, Behind the Scenes featurette, Keep Your Mind Wide Open music video by AnnaSophia Robb, two audio commentaries with cast and crew, and previews.

1588170,1,B00005JPL5,"This film could have been almost acceptable as a tragedy, if there was a point to all the suffering.  There wasn't.  It could have been a kid's adventure move if the characters had been written to see anything remotely amazing or grow in any more meaningful way.  Not so.  It could have been a morality play if characters' intentional actions were linked to consequences.  They weren't.

As it is, the film is a vile protracted trudge through pointless suffering, punctuated by fleeting and insipid moments of sad fantasy by doomed characters.  No good deed goes unpunished; all opportunities for growth are resolved in dime novel or mean-spirited fashions.

If you love suffering, guilt, shame, futility, and incompetence set in an uncaring and malevolent universe, this is the film for you.

I'm still retching.

From the advertisements I recalled it looked something like the Spiderwick Chronicles, something else I hadn't seen but wasn't interested in at all. I decided to put on Terabithia for my niece, and long after she went to bed I was hooked on the movie. I was so hooked in fact, that when a tragic event occurs towards the end of the film I was still fighting back tears long after. The beauties of love and loss are so well played here, especially considering the main characters' age. If you're looking for another tired fantasy film aimed at kids, look elsewhere. This movie is apparently based on a work of young adult fiction that's very popular/challenged by censors (thank you wikipedia), and I won't go into detail about the storyline, but know that this movie affected me in a way few have.

I believe reviews should be written based on the genre of the movie; you may just hate crime movies, but don't give the Godfather a bad review because you don't like the genre. With that being said, Terabithia, while having fantasy and adventure elements is really a Drama and Tragedy. I agree, the trailers really do mislead you.

The fantasy scenes are the kids' way of dealing with their struggles at school and home. You may be hoping at the end that something magical will happen, but that is not what this movie is about. Its about loneliness, isolation, bullies, friendship, imagination, crushes, the yearning for close family relations, questions about what happens when you die, loss (deep loss), acceptance, hope and love. Every reaction is very human, which is the point the creators intended, but be prepared for it - if you're not in a soul searching mood, go ahead and pass on the movie. You have heard of the stages of grief, and they are most covered, but we are taken beyond acceptance.

The plot is familiar. Jesse, a teenage boy, although big and husky enough lets himself get bullied at school. He's an outsider (what else is new?), the butt of jokes; he's a fast runner, and has a gift for art. He is alienated from his mother and father and two of his four sisters. (His two nasty sisters are reminiscent of Cinderella's two caustic step-sisters.) He is close to one little sister. A strange new free soul of a girl, Leslie, comes to school, outraces Jesse, and eventually they become soul mates who discover a fantasy world.
The stereotypical schoolyard bullies are in play. Leslie's father is like an empathetic resurrected hippie while Jesse's tough-minded dad takes an awful long time to come around. The movie has a good message to convey, and it holds your interest although some clichs and stock characters and time-worn plot devices are in evidence. It's about misfits who triumph.

It's nothing but another movie about a boy with a wild imagination that we never see much of at all - the whole story is about the boy not fitting in very well and then meeting a girl who has plenty of personal problems as well...then they build a rapport based on the boy's imaginary world of Terabithia - which we never get to really see.
Then, as if the movie wasn't disappointing enough, there is an accident and the girl drowns. Shock and dismay rule the end of this movie.

More so because in the 2007 version the parts that both Jess and Leslie imagined were very well animated. Also, there was not as much character development in the PBS version; so the viewer is not as drawn into the emotion that Jess feels when he loses his new best friend, Leslie. This story was supposed to be a tragic but revealing experience for a young pre-adolescent who has to deal with death. I was not moved by this version of the story.  I believe that a talent of Annette O' Toole's stature was wasted in this Production. The film was just too short, very low budget and not developed well at all.",1207872000,,716,4.507692307692308

1588341,5,B00005JPL5,"Don't read this unless you don't mind knowing the trajedy that happens in this movie....
I just watched this with my family--husband and three boys ages 10, 7, and 5.  I absolutely loved it.  It is full of beautiful life lessons.  It shows in a profound way the power of imagination, and that magical thinking in children is very healthy and helps them make sense of their world and work through issues and difficulties.  I was touched by so many things.  One was when we saw the face of the giant.  I think that was profound.
For parents reading this and wondering if it would be too sad for their children, I think they should know what happens.  My oldest son had been told at school that the girl dies.  I told my kids it would be sad, and that the girl dies and that it is just a movie telling a story.  I think this helped VERY much.  If we had been surprised by the death, which was shocking even though I knew it was eventually going to happen, it would have been very upseting.  My boys were fine and enjoyed the movie.  I am grateful for the beautiful lessons they saw illustrated.  Yes, it is sad.  But so is life.  And for so, so many children life is full of trajedy.  In some cities in this country eighty percent of adolescents have experienced severe violence or family trajedy.  We need to get real.  This movie isn't to traumatize--it's to help show how the human spirit can overcome trajedy.  ALSO, it is important to know that this movie is not at all violent.  The make believe scenes are very mild, and even fun.  The shadows or creatures represent things that are scarey for the children in their lives, and they conquer them!  Also, the commercials for this movie misrepresented its genre, I think.  This is not a movie FILLED with the fast action make believe.  That is a very small part of the movie.  This is a thinking movie about human relationships and emotion.
This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!!!",1201392000,5,1940,4.397183098591549

1588343,5,B00005JPL5,"I can't express how surprising it is to me to come here to review this movie, and to see that some people actually rated it a 1. Everyone has different tastes, and different ideas of what constitutes a good film. But ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is one of those films that, for me at least, crosses all boundaries and has something to offer to each and every person.

I won't recap the plot, as I'm sure you will find plenty of other reviews here that do just that. But first I have to say that the young leads in this movie, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, are the heart and soul of this movie. Little Bailee Madison also hold her own. Too often these days filmmakers rely on the dazzling CGI and the heart-pounding action sequences to drive the story. But in this film, whether by intent or not I can't say for sure, these kids take the reigns from the very start and they drive the story forward with the skill that many far older actors could stand to learn.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" reminds me of films like ""Old Yeller,"" and of books like ""Where the Red Fern Grows,"" with a bit of ""The Wizard of Oz"" wonder thrown in for good measure. Yes, there is sadness and loss in this movie, and I know that turns some people off. But there is sadness and loss in the real world, and try as we might, sometimes it hits so close to home that we can't protect our children from it. I would not suggest it for very little kids, or for those who are fragile emotionally. But there are lessons to be learned from this film, about friendship and love and feeling like a freak or an outsider (I could tell you stories about the last item for sure!), and also on how to deal with grief and loss. Those aren't things you learn after you become an adult. Those are things we must learn when we're young and wide-eyed and open-minded. Those are the lessons that help us become adults.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" is one of those films that you really should let you children see. And I suggest that you sit down and watch it with them. It's rare to see a film that can actually foster the growth of family bonds and also provide life lessons for your kids in a fun and exciting way. Don't miss this little gem of a film. The hype around it when it was originally released was great. But in truth, the film itself is far, far better than the hype ever let on.

1588389,5,B00005JPL5,"This movie is much like Pan's Labyrinth but not as dark and dramatic with the storytelling. When seeing the original trailer for both of these films we thought that these movies would be like a Never Ending story or more recently Chronicles of Narni. A majority of the film critics believed that the trailer to Bridge to Terabithia was very misleading because of the fantasy world that you see in the preview. We at cinemaguys.com also were misinformed but never the less; we were satisfied with this film's intellectual and the adult means of exploring fantasy through the story telling--as we were for Pan's Labyrinth.

Our movie focuses on the story of two elementary school children who are in the sixth grade. Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie Burke (Anna Sophia Robb) are both artistic students; Jesse likes to draw and Leslie likes to write about fantasy--like her parents. They share similar difficulties of getting along with their peers in school, as well as their respective families because of their unambiguous imaginations--especially the girl. To escape from the bullies and along with their family circumstances, Leslie invites Jesse into her fantasy world of Terabithia but in order to get there they must travel into the woods, and cross a stream with a rope. Once across they find an old tree house and together they make the fantasy world of Terabithia come to life. How will this flight of the imagination affect their relationships with the ""real world?""

The first fantasy drama--geared towards the family--where the movie does not have to rely on the stereotypical fantasy theme that were so accustomed to seeing along with the special effects, to help the story line to be successful. The writer and director implement fantasy--as an educational building block--to express a student's self-confidence.
For example, The boy is constantly being ridicule whether it is by his family (his father) or his peers for being too much of a loner--no social skills--and more importantly for his colorful imagination when it comes to his art. Because of this, his classmates as well as own family--his father mainly--become bullies in his life not physically but mentally.
That is where Leslie's becomes an important attribute in the story telling because through her mind she enables the story of Terabithia to erect his courage when he is facing these imaginary creatures. As the movie progresses, he learns how to handle his problems that he faces against theses creatures: at first through aggression but then through kindness, through his fantasy experience. Through his acquaintance with these creatures, he learns to deal with these bullies, who are present in his everyday life.
Leslie's fantasy world in the end brings Jesse, the courage that he always was lacking and makes him develop into sociable young man.
Movies about fantasy do not always have to be like a Never Ending story or Chronicles of Narnia to stir the imagination of children and their families alike. This movie delivers because of the message of self-worth, and not just to benefit Jesse, but also through the other characters that are important in his life.

Permission granted because of these significant reasons: how fantasy is explored in an intellectual manner through the character development in Jesse and Leslie, through the theme of Pan's Labyrinth, but is given to us in a more unsophisticated way-- think of it as Pan Lite for kids. The most imperative reason, because it brings back the imagination we once were accustomed to when we were kids.",1196899200,2,3557,5.076923076923077

For their film version of ""Holes"" they asked the author to write the screenplay. For this adaptation of ""Bridge to Terabithia"" they asked the author's son to write the screenplay. He did a fine job. I have not ever seen a film that treated so well the interplay between light and darkness, wonder and drudgery, that we experience in daily life.

This is also a story about the need for fantasy. Early in the film the girl character tells the boy character that they need a place with none of the sort of bullies and tormentors they have to deal with at Junior High. Strangely enough, when they go into their imaginary fantasy world they find they have not managed to leave their real life enemies behind, only changed them into CG creatures. Through play-acting and imagination, the two young teenagers learn courage and compassion that they can then apply to their real life problems. It is a comforting, classic coming-of-age tale, until you get to the end.

Those of you who have read the book know it has a devastating downer of an ending. Take hope. This is a Disney film after all. It does manage to put the end on a more positive note by toning down the angst and emphasizing how the tragedy brings new understanding and prompts Jess to begin building a relationship with his younger sister.

I would love to be more like her!  I thought her character was so creative and imaginative.  I saw her as somebody who really knew how to use her mind to enjoy life.  She was so helpful to her friend, Jess whose family was so caught up in making ends meet that they seemed to lose sight of how to just spend time together enjoying each other's company. AnnaSophia Robb (Leslie) and Josh Hutcherson (Jess) did such an incredible job acting that I was convinced that they truly brought out the best in each other and allowed each other to be totally real. I could see that they had a true friendship without anything sexual going on.  I was enjoying this part of the movie so much that I was caught totally off guard when tragedy struck.  I think I cried for the entire rest of the movie.  I don't believe any Disney movie has ever had the kind of substance that could evoke that kind of emotion from me....except maybe  ""Old Yeller"". But, Old Yeller was such a long time ago.  I watched this movie with my 10 and 12 year old boys.  They enjoyed the movie too.  Not exactly the same way I did though. They  loved the fantasy games that Jess and Leslie played. It was exciting.  My 12 year old was pretty quiet after the tragedy.  I think he might of shed a tear.  I didn't think my 10 year old had an ounce of sensitivity in him until I asked him, ""Didn't it make you even a little sad?""  He replied, ""Sure Mom, I thought it was sad but I didn't want Nick  to see me cry and call me a baby"".  Funny that Nick agreed with that saying that if he would have cried more, Noah would've made fun of him.  This is an example of peer pressure which is also dealt with in this movie.

1588459,5,B00005JPL5,"Let's get the worst gripes of many reviewers out of the way, shall we?

1. Not a fantasy movie
Yes, the marketing was... made... did... huh? Ok, point taken. The previews were all focused completely on the ""fantasy world"" CGI. Bad decision.

2. Not for kids
Ehhh... what? People don't want to ""expose"" kids to the somethomes harsh realities of life? People die. Children die. The way to deal with it is to talk about it, not to shelter kids from it, so they can *really* break down when they're older and have never had any experience with death...

Ok, now, the review:

I've never read the book (in all honesty, the title made me believe this was a very new story dreamt up by the minds of the Disney Fungineers), but the book (as well as the movie) are both on my wishlist, now. I did expect a Narnia-type story, but the lack of special effects made the movie that much more touching. I don't have to repeat the synopsis (it's right up there on the product page), but what this movie did was touch me and my wife deeply and profoundly, and it ranks right up there with ""Grave of the Fireflies"", ""Tideland"" and ""Running with scissors"" - all movies that deal with children who are subject to tragedy, in bigger or lesser degrees.

The acting is solid (and in this Drake and Josh Hannah Montana age where children on TV and in movies are either obnoxious wise*** brats or way too sweet and smart for their age, AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson put down a performance that is truly inspiring and awesome in the true meaning of the word; they should be considered an example for young actors everywhere), the adults aren't simply caricatures, and the backstory of the children (both the heroes and the bullies) is, if maybe somewhat exaggeratedly clich, believable.

Bridge To Terabithia may not be a fantasy movie, but it is a heartwarming story of friendship, and an inspiring and straight-forward way to introduce the concept of death and loss to the younger ones among us.

Is it a long movie? Sure, it's quite a bit to chew through, but does even death have to be cut down to MTV length? At slightly more than an hour and a half, this movie proved, for my wife and I, anyway, a great discussion topic. I'm man enough to admit that I cried all through the last 15 or 20 minutes. Not knowing the story, I never saw the tragedy coming, and it - well, let's keep this reader-friendly - it felt like I had the air punched out of me.

I've seen a lot of movies, and feel I have become hardened against all the weepy strings and violins that are supposed to get people's emotions going. A movie that sidetracks me like this... wow. The movie got me thinking about my own life, the chances I took and the opportunities I missed... it isn't too often that a movie (a DISNEY movie, even!) can awaken such thoughts and emotions in me.

I have to tip my hat at the director and the actors for keeping me glued to the screen until after the last of the end titles had faded away. In tears.

Don't be afraid of death, or movies that aren't all special effects. This movie proves that Disney is still capable of putting out a quality product.

1588461,5,B00005JPL5,"I watched this movie only because one of my best friends told me that it was ""great, you'll love it""; before she then cautiously added ""it sort of has a bitter-sweet ending"".
In my mind, there's no better way to describe this movie.

For the first part of it, I was absolutely awed by this film. The acting is what especially stood out to me; but the directing, music, special effects, writing and everything else were all top-notch. I found myself absolutely falling in love with the main characters, Jesse and Leslie; thanks to the amazing acting from AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson. Even the supporting roles were wonderfully acted out.

But, before I go any further about the quality of the movie...I would like to point out that it was SORELY mis-advertised by Disney. This movie was portrayed like it would be some light-hearted, dim-headed Chronicles of Narnia rip-off; which is why it look me a friend's reccomendation to see it in the first place. Oh, how wrong my opinions from those trailers were. This movie is a poignant slice-of-how-hard-life-is piece of art, and is definately not for the little ones.

However, that's not to say that Bridge to Terabithia is an objectional movie. Not at all. Ratings wise, it is indeed suitable for all ages; but the subject matter is dark and, as my friend said, ""bitter-sweet""; to the point where it left both of my parents depressed and me in tears. Just when this movie is convincing you of it's magic, a heartbreaking tragedy is delievered like a kick in the teeth. Again, this tragedy is poignant and beautiful; but that doesn't make it any less depressing!! I would absolutely not reccomend watching this movie with younger children, because they'll end up in tears.
Despite that someone made a review saying ""life is not that hard"", I'd have to say it is. I could really empathize with Jesse being bullied at school, and Leslie's inability to fit in because of her wide imagination and unique fashion sense. In fact, the tragedy that happens later in this movie apparently happened to my older brother on a school trip years and years ago; which only makes me realize how real this movie is.

Still, tragedy and all, this is an absolutely beautiful movie, and is millions of times better than one would think upon first glance. It's definately one of my favorites, even if I am feeling totally bummed out after watching it.
Bottom line: Terabithia is wonderful, but bitter sweet. It's like a Sour Patch Kid's candy turned inside-out. Five stars.

I think the kids will like it"", when the boy walks into the house and his family is upset about where he has been. My mouth dropped open when they told him why they were worried. I did not see that coming at all. In fact, I went from saying what a good family movie it was...to tears. I was shocked at the turn this story took, because there was no warning about what was coming, either in the trailer or any type of foreshadowing. For older kids, this might be the basis for talking about death, water safety, etc...but that is not how this movie was portrayed.

The actress playing the young girl was phenomenal, believable and I wanted to give her a big hug for the kindness she showed to the boy in his mean world. The girl was obviously loved, but her parents only had time for her during times when they were not busy, which was seldom. The boy is adored by his younger sister, but is often berated and not given much positive encouragement in his life, especially from his father.  The movie rates a 4 star, the deceptive marketing of this movie rates a 2 star.",1192147200,8,1774,4.418960244648318

1588464,4,B00005JPL5,"The trailer tried to make this look like another Narnia or even LOTR movie when in actuality there are about 10 minutes worth of special effects scenes in the whole movie.

That's ok. I love movies for what they are, not what they aren't. Still, I am offended by the deceitful marketing.

Expect a drama about two outcast pre-teens who become friends and help each other to cope with the difficulty of school, bullies, family, etc. and you will probably enjoy it very much.

The acting from both of the two children leads is very good. I expect we will see great things from these two kids in the future. I enjoyed Josh Hutchinsen in Zathura as well and he seems to be keeping busy with 1-2 movies each year for the next 2-3 years.

The extras on this DVD are pretty good. The commentary track with the two lead kids (and a producer) gave lots of interesting insight into how they made the film along with some funny stuff about the little sister actor and others in the cast.

I recommend this movie to anybody who can sit through a somewhat slow-paced movie without much action but a wonderful story with a lot of heart - only DON'T watch the trailer first. It will probably set you up for disappointed.",1191456000,2,1205,4.4343891402714934

While the movie is excellent I think parents of younger children should realize that the storyline is very heavy. Maybe those who have read the book do know this. I was not one of those people.

As a mother who did lose a child tragically and my surviving son who lost his brother, this movie really did a number on us both.  I really wish there'd been some sort of warning so that I'd known that there was a scene that would bring up the horror that I've already lived through once and had no desire to experience again - even in film!

Otherwise, I do have to say I honestly enjoyed the relationship between the main characters and really loved how they created this whole imaginary world and could have really really loved this movie but again, the tragedy just destroyed my enjoyment of it and we weren't able to resume watching it after that.

I was expecting a lot of fantasy/ computer generated stuff but found the bulk of the movie to drag on in an almost boring manner. Two depressed, miserable children with few/ no friends who meet and become friends through their shared fantasy world- not much for the little ones in that outline is there?
The movie does have many interesting moments but there is very little that would be funny or entertaining for small children, and a little after church discussion that some would not want their children to hear.
I found the extras to be the best part of the DVD for me, including the bit with the author saying she supported the movie and her son being a producer- it must be fairly close to the original text of the book wth that then I guess.

I think the studio decided that most viewers would have read the book before seeing it, and therefore decided that the somewhat-misleading campaign was okay. I'd be very angry if I had watched it with younger children. If you are hoping for a ""Chronicles of Narnia"" ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Harry Potter""-type film, STAY AWAY!

This movie is entertaining for adults and teens, with its fabulous tales of make-believe and the dilemma we can all relate to - children fleeing bullies and the cruel world that is public school - but tragedy keeps it from being a real family movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 12 or 13. I expected to see a fantasy movie, and this was anything but.

The best thing about ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is not its terrific special effects, or even its story, but the fabulous performances from its youthful stars. I hope to see more of them in the future, and hope they don't get lost in Hollywood's child-star mill.

But, again, it is NOT a film for children. A friend compared his family's experience to him bringing a puppy home for his kids and then shooting it in front of them. This is most emphatically NOT a movie to share with your children, unless you want to see them cry bitterly - and NOT remember the movie with fondness afterwards.",1189900800,,1381,4.605691056910569

If you are even sensitive in the LEAST you WILL CRY. I know an older guy, who watched it with his daughter and cried for quite some time afterward. I cried for at least twenty minutes.

The acting by the two leads, and the adult characters is excellent. Annasophia has a Dakota Fanning-like quality to her, making her the PERFECT Leslie, and Josh Huchenson (I honestly cannot remember HOW to spell his last name) as Jesse, really does a fantastic job on his part.

The two become friends and use their imagination to turn a secret spot in the woods into a beautiful kingdom.  In ""Terabithia,"" they rule over the strange but good creatures and battle the Dark Lord.  Everything is great, until one day when Jess doesn't come to play.

This movie could have, and should have been wonderful, with flights of fancy that made me say, ""WOW!"" and touching moments that left me teary.  Unfortunately, it missed the mark.  The fantasy land the children created wasn't that big of a deal; we only saw fleeting glimpses of it and never had time to be awed by its wonder and wish it were real.  The two young leads, Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, were competent, but not special.  Neither of them had the charisma to own the screen and make me care about them.  Of course, the big culprit was the script, which tried to include too much, ending up with not enough.  We get Jess' poverty, artistic talent, and loneliness, Leslie's quirkiness and pluck, the bullies at school, his crush on his teacher, and the often-annoying cute younger sister, complete with precious lisp; with all this, there wasn't time to make Terabithia seem real or as fantastic as it should have been.

1588613,4,B00005JPL5,"""Bridge to Terabithia"" is that rare movie about enchantment that really is enchanting.  Based on the novel by Katherine Paterson, this is like a more kid-friendly version of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" in that both films deal with unhappy children who retreat into a fully realized world of fantasy - the difference being that, in this case at least, it is a world seemingly of their own making.

Jesse Aarons, a local farm boy, is a regular target of bullies at school, while Leslie Burke is the new kid in town, never an easy thing to be when you're an underclassman in a school full of obnoxious, belligerent eighth graders who don`t mind showing you who`s boss every time you walk down the hallway or dare to use the lavatory.  The two new friends obviously need a place to get away from their troubles, so in the forest nearby, they create the imaginary kingdom of Terabithia, filled with wondrous creatures and non-threatening ogres, that becomes increasingly actualized as the story goes on.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" succeeds by  keeping it uncluttered and simple and by focusing more on the daily lives of Jesse and Leslie than on their adventures in the forest.  Fantasy, the film seems to be saying, is for those special times when reality gets to be just a bit too much to handle, but that the real, everyday world is the place we all must inhabit for most of our time here on earth.  The movie is all in favor of childhood imagination, but not at the expense of real world experiences and relationships.

The tricky premise  is brought to charming cinematic life by writers Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson, director Gabor Csupo, and the special effects experts who understand that less is often more when it comes to making the fantastical real and believable on screen.  But primary credit goes to the utterly winning performances by Josh Hutcherson, Anna Sophia Robb, and six-year old Bailee Madison, who, as Jesse's adorable kid sister, reminds one of Drew Barrymore in her early ""E.T."" days.  All three do a lovely job embodying the youthful exuberance and openhearted wonder that are so much a part of the movie's vision and theme.

Parents should note that, while the movie may be too emotionally wrenching for very young children (there`s an unusually stark plot development towards the end of the film), it is ideal viewing for slightly older kids and younger teens.  It's great fun, too, for adults not yet too jaded and cynical to tap into the dream.",1187481600,,2464,4.783018867924528
1588614,5,B00005JPL5,"I read the slightest of summaries of this movie in a Time magazine but was never particularly motivated to watch it.  I knew of the novel but had never read it.  Had it not been for my daughter picking it out one night while we rented movies, I may never have seen it and that truly would have been a shame.

There was so much that I loved about this movie.  It had so many messages and such sensitivity and yet it was presented in a very plain and straight forward way.  There are clear messages about bullying, about judging others, and about being true to yourself and none of them are presented in a preachy manner.  Though we certainly root for Leslie and Jesse, they are not always the winners in this tale.

Jesse has a very hard life and a father who's rather neglectful and none of this is embellished so as to make it seem lighter than it truly is.  When he is mocked because of the hand-me-down sneakers he is forced to wear, we feel the sting of the taunts and the unfairness of them.  Jesse is already beaten down by life, forced to face a harsh reality that holds little enough joy for him.

As for Leslie, she remains true to herself but must pay the cost for her refusal to conform.  When she does try to be a revolutionary, there are consequences and it's sad to see the fight drain out of her.  Still, Leslie never gives up hope that there's something better and she never ceases to see the world for its potential as well as its reality.

And yet for all the sadness of this film, it is also lovely and uplifting.  The friendship that develops between Leslie and Jesse is truly touching and speaks volumes about the power of the human ability to touch others and to help bring out the best in them.  Watching Leslie and Jesse make their own happiness as they carve out their own little world is remarkable.

There is a profoundly sad portion to this film and I was surprised to find myself reduced to a rather serious fit of tears over a movie I thought of as a ""child's"" film.  And yet the tragedy in this movie was not superfluous and is important for children who live in a world that is every bit as real as the one inhabited by us adults.  Sometimes life is unfair, as this movie shows, but even in the midst of tragedy we are capable of doing extraordinary things and reaching out to those whom we have previously neglected.  This is exactly what Jesse does and I think it exemplifies one of the movie's most significant message: there is no way to quantify the importance of simple human kindness.",1187308800,8,2523,4.329787234042553

This movie crackles with life, sizzles with a powerful pro-family message, and delivers it all tied tightly with a clear message of hope, joy, and the bond between one's family members.

It's a tear-jerker, don't get me wrong. But a tear-jerker in the same way Old Yeller was many decades ago. It's a story that's true to life and, as everyone knows, in real life people die.

Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are outstanding in this film. AnnaSophia, especially, is a stand-out. She practically shines in every scene -- literally. Her blonde hair is aglow and her face is lit up like a beacon.

This is a movie with a powerful message: Love, compassion, and family can overcome even the world's worst pain and suffering. Yes, there's a little girl who spouts off slightly askew biblical comments (about not believing the Bible and going to  hell for it -- a concept nowhere found in the Bible) and another girl (AnnaSophia's character) who doubts the statement and offers one of her own. Does that not happen all the time? Do people -- even Christians -- always have answers ready?

No way, man. I've been a Christian for some 25 years. I've studied theology, all translations of the Bible, and have attended churches of various denominations. I've discovered Christians do NOT have all the answers -- especially regarded the precise meaning of certain passages of the Bible -- and that many have missed the boat regarding finding joy in life.

Bridge to Terabithia is a movie about joy, about celebrating life, and about the power of imagination to lift one out of the valleys and set one on the peaks.

Young children are cautioned not to watch this movie, however, The tragic death of someone in it may be too much to take. The death doesn't occur on-screen, but it occurs after everyone falls in love with the character. So please watch responsibly.

But do watch. This is a glorious movie that should be in everyone's home, and watched often.

I saw a bumper sticker once that simply said, ""The meaning of life is to live it.""

So stop arguing and debating the merits of this movie, especially in regard to its Christian/Biblical foundation. It is what it is. And it's a powerful movie for people of all faiths to watch.

""The meaning of life is to live it."" It's that simple.

Enjoy Bridge to Terabithia.

I was wondered, surprised, and crying like a baby by the end. I have NEVER had any movie hit me the way this one did. No, not even ""my girl""...I went and hugged my wife and kids afterwords and told them how much I loved them.

This movie is SO important on so many levels, but it would not be powerful without the wonderful acting of the main hero and heroine...they give performances as real, convincing and as moving as any adult I've ever seen, and perhaps even more so. This movie is about growing up, opening your mind, living life to it's fullest for every moment, making friends, losing friends, making memories, making families, using your imagination, and discovery.

I would like to know why Disney can't make a true children's movie without someone dying.  I expected to be entertained by this movie, not upset by it.  It has been done for five minutes and I am still crying.  I understand it was based on a book, but they change books all the time.  They could have found a better way.  Too many disney movies involve death.  It is starting to get morbid and I am about to start screening them before letting my kids watch anymore movies by Disney.  Think about it.  From Bambi forward.  My children got upset seeing me get upset.  Disney is supposed to be happy and for children.  I don't find death happy and I don't find it appropriate for my children to have it in the background of their childhood entertainments.

So, I recommend this movie . . . for adults.  I recommend screening this movie if you have elementary age children so that you can be prepared for some of the subject matter.

The movie itself is quite interesting, in the fact that so very few films actually incorporate imagination as the driving force in the story.  Most stories tend to cope out, in movies regarding magical worlds, by making it seem as though the protagonists stumble upon secret entrances to such world.

Terabithia, however, doesn't shy away from the fact that it's magical world (a surprisingly full world) is born out of two people's imagination.  This, in my opinion, makes this magical world even more powerful, because it relies on the magic of our imagination.",1186531200,,641,4.962616822429907
1588662,4,B00005JPL5,"There are many Hollywood formula movies that I do not care much about. Bridge to Terabithia will remain as one of those movies that touched my heart. It is based on a children's novel by Katherine Paterson. The movie stars AnnaSophia Robb from Denver, Colorado and Josh Hutcherson from Union, Kentucky. These two kids' names will be worth remembering.

The chemistry between the hero and heroine is amazing. Jesse who Josh plays has solemn look of a loner who are struggling to grow up. Leslie who AnnaSophia plays is vibrant with magnetic personality but lives in her own world as that is  what she learned from her parents. Jesse and Leslie being a neighbor becomes good friend and Leslie leads Jesse into a friendship and her world. Through the relationship Jesse grows up.. rather quickly.

I was mesmerized by the vibrance and the beauty of AnnaSophia all through out the movie. She will be a force to deal with in Hollywood. Jesse's ackwardness in growing up portray the puberty the preteens face. It was beautifully acted by Josh. Both characters shine as actors and carries the movie to the end.

The movie was directed by Gabor Csupo for Disney/Walden Media and was filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. That is important because those two choices seem to make the movie a bit mysterious, rustic, and brings that touch of fairy tales scenes. It would not have been what it is if it was filmed in suburb USA.

1588664,1,B00005JPL5,"Let's cut right to the chase here. The girl goes to church for the first time in her life and on the ride home in the back of a pick up truck she makes the statement that she doesn't believe the Bible to be true and that God has better things to do than to deal with unrepentant sinners. Well well well, so much for why Jesus came to earth and gave His life as ransom for our sin. Talk about dragging the Holy Son of God through the mud and counting His saving work for us all as a common thing.

Throughout the movie, the boy's church going parents are portrayed as inattentive, borderline abusive trailer trash. While the girl's are portrayed as sensitive, caring, new age lovers of life. Quite a contrast, but it is there and nothing is written into a story without a reason.

Well the girl up and dies which leaves the question ""Is she in hell?"" The boy asks his father to which he replies that he doesn't think God would send a sweet little girl like that to hell.

A sweet little girl that throughout the movie committed sinful acts without any regret or repentance. She made up a horrible lie about a classmate, sure the classmate was a bully, but the lie also involved an otherwise innocent party. She stole items often, so she was now both a liar and a thief. And ultimately she openly and verbally rejected the free and saving grace offered to her by God in the person of Christ Jesus.

1588708,4,B00005JPL5,"Personally, I believe one of the reasons for Terabithia's relative underwhelming box-office was its marketing campaign. From the trailers and the initial buzz, it sounded like it was going to be a sort of spiritual follow-up to Chronicles of Narnia with big effects, action set-pieces and the like. But when a family film with human elements mixed in with creatures now and then came out, people were like ""wha? where's all the flashy stuff?"" It's too bad since, on occasion the film has a few flaws, this is actually quite an entertaining film even if you don't watch with kids.

Jess is one of those kids that grows up with in a hard-working family that struggles to make ends meet (just a suggestion: maybe not have so many kids?). Secondhand clothes and can't even get a new pair of shoes, he's picked on a lot at school. Enter Leslie who is of a more wealthier family but her quirky likes and attitudes gets her much disdain from others also. But with Jess's love for art and Leslie's overactive imagination, the 2 quickly bond and using the woods nearby their houses, they imagine a fantasy world named Terabithia with creatures and various races and start to learn about growing up and making long-lasting friendships.

Now, I will admit that the more fantasy aspects of the story might be seen as out of place. If you're putting in effects, why not go full-throttle right? But that's not the point here which uses the Terabithia world to show kids imagining to escape their real lives. Bullies take on the forms of different races in their make-believe world and adults who don't know how to deal with children who are growing older. But it sort of livens up the film by showing the Weta effects since if they were taken out, this thing would be schmaltzy like crazy. It's mainly story-driven which might make it that sort of catch-22 feeling: too character driven for the younger crowd and not enough wonder for the older crowd.

It's also great to see that the bulk of the film is focused on 2 actors who are NOT annoying. While not a flashy role, Josh Hutcherson plays that character who's surprised yet down-to-earth about the real world and the fantasy one without overplaying one of them. Getting the more flashier role is AnnaSophia Robb who reminds me of a younger Natalie Portman who has quite a stage presence although her more wilder flights of fancy could be dialed down since she always seems ""on"". Also kudos for casting the way-too-adorable-to-be-real Zooey Deschanel and Robert Patrick playing Jess's dad.

I should mention the ending since that's what got the biggest attention. It follows the book as far as tone and although it's quite a big development in the film, I can understand why people won't like it since kid movies aren't meant to be this ""heavy"". But considering many of us remember Bambi's mother and watching those kind of films, here it makes sense and handled perfectly.

I'd recommend it to kids although I'm not sure what they'll think of it. It's not as visually exciting as Narnia or cool as Harry Potter but for an adult, it's quite enjoyable so at least if your kids don't like it, at least you can.",1186185600,6,3148,4.675090252707581

1588710,2,B00005JPL5,"While the two young people who played the leading role were a delight to watch, this movie twists and turns down such a tragic path that I don't understand why it was marketed as a children's movie.

It is more along the lines of a serious drama. I'm sorry to spoil the plot for anyone, but if you have young children with sensitive hearts who think they're in for another ""Narnia,"" they will be sadly disappointed and probably horrified -- as my 8 year old neice was -- to watch a beloved character actually be killed in a very tragic, jolting way.

This film relates the special friendship between a young boy and young girl who have marvellous imaginations. But other than that, I cannot say WHY this film was created... or why the upsetting plot twist. There seems to be no lesson in it, at least not for me. It was just tragic.

It certainly should not have been marketed as being about a magical, imaginary world--it is more about the painful reality and loss in life.
I would not have taken my young neice to see it if I had known as much.
The only scene in which imaginary characters were clearly seen was just before the end credits. Do not expect a fantasy film.

Despite Disney's deceptive marketing, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is still an uplifting family movie about the power of imagination and the importance of friendship, but an unnecessary slight on Christian beliefs nearly ruined it for me.  As excellent as the rest of the story is, many Christian parents will hesitate to let their children watch a movie that casts doubt on their beliefs (specifically, the teaching that our lives have eternal consequences).

The film does have some positive aspects.  AnnaSophia Robb is wonderful as Leslie, and lights up the screen.  I also appreciated the message that we shouldn't judge people based on initial surface impressions (the overly-strict teacher and the 8th grade bully turn out to have more facets to their characters than we expect).

It was a lot better than what I saw in the trailer, but I assumed that there would be more special effects - not just filming in a small wooded area in New Zealand. I thought that since it was Disney it would at least have many special effects and have a magical ending. Disney disappointed me. The movie was not the greatest or totally amazing. It made me cry thought so it was... OK. The Chronicles of Narnia was much better - more special effects and a beautiful meaning. If you hate the Chronicles of Narnia understand that C. S. Lewis made it a religious story line. Aslan is like God in his books and in the movie though not clearly persepted. You must understand how it is to be a believer and actually believe in God to fully understand and get the movie The Chronicles of Narnia, so don't go around dissing it. Instead just say you don't understand and keep on stupidily acting ignorant, or... you can find out what it really means.

We are so much more accepting of deaths of ""bad guys!""

The main female character is so cheery throughout the movie that this comes as a nasty shocker.  I wouldn't recommend the movie for younger children that have not faced a death yet.

The rest of the movie is great!  The rest of the movie is imaginative!  The DVD has the makings of the movie where the creatures are noted as being modeled after some of the school bullies, which is rather amusing once one ""gets"" that!

1588899,5,B00005JPL5,"This is a wonderful movie.  As several angry reviewers point out it is NOT a fantasy movie; it is a movie about fantasy, or, more exactly, imagination.

Some reviewers have complained that the movie is inappropriate for small children; many parents would doubtlessly agree.  I am not a parent (who else but a DINK would have time to write long reviews for a website), and would not presume to make such judgments.  [SPOILER] An important character dies (at least on the surface, plot level of the movie), and there are occasional strong undercurrents of sexuality (although nothing explicit).

Still, I fear many may have missed the point of the movie.  It is about the price we pay for growing up.  Children becoming adults slowly discover adult things, and in the process lose their enormous powers of imagination.  The death of Leslie (played perfectly by AnnaSophia Robb) is more representative of the death of Jess' imagination (at least the kind of powerful child imagination which can instantly construct worlds), than a real death.  It is no accident that the boy (played by Josh Hucherson in a somewhat uneven performance) chooses not to take Leslie with on his ""date"" (a trip to the art museum) with his attractive art teacher, and the object of his first crush.  Leslie's death would have been avoided had she gone with Jess and their teacher on this outing.  Instead, in that moment where play and fantasy lose out to sexual desire, Leslie dies and is never seen again.  My wife and I wept at this, which would have been impossible but for the delicate (not over-the-top) depiction of Jess and Leslie's ""real"" and play worlds, and the fact that AnnaSophia Robb is a most enchanting young lady, truly more elfin than human.

The touching ending has Jess introducing his baby sister to the imaginary world he'd built with Leslie (that is, with his child creativity).  We then share his baby sister's view of this wonderful new world, this time--given her younger and even more powerful imagination--dramatically more colorful and fantastic.

A piece of Cinematic Art from 21st Century Disney?  Amazing, but true.  I think what disturbed most reviewers is that this movie was advertised as a fantasy movie for children, sort of a toned down Lord of the Rings. Quite misleading.

Then there is the interrelations between the family members that is hinted at but not explored.  Of course there is the almost plot regarding the school bullies, but that is set up and then abandoned as a plot line so it is never brought to any sort of point or conclusion.  Of course there is the relationship between Jess and Leslie which apparently is intended as the plot and it gets the most attention but it never seems to go anywhere which is unfortunate because this could have been a glorious film, but Terribithia appears in only the last two minutes of the film.  So the imagination which should have driven the film was hinted at but never developed.  Then there was the art and the art teacher which was again introduced as a possible subplot but then abandoned.  This entire film consisted of potential plot lines that are never explored leaving the entire film as a hash of directionless and pointless actions.

The only negative I have to mention is that I think the sadness (I'm trying not to give away too much here for those who haven't seen the movie) brought into the movie near the end is unnecessary. This movie is intended as a family movie, and throwing that element in is not only sad, it's a bit disconcerting.

1. The whole Terabithia thing was just like an episode of Barney- they were just using their Imaginations.  If they were imagining all this, then they could have come up with more.  They had limited imaginations.

2. The cute little girl DIES.  Was that really necessary???  Why not let her dog die or something?  Is this a kids' movie?  Kids don't want to see little girls die.

3. Why in the heck couldn't the little boy at least Imagine that the girl was still alive in Terabithia???  He could have imagined her as a princess, queen, etc.  He just lets her die though!

For a kids' fantasy movie, this is perhaps one of the most shocking sequences I've seen. Think about it. In Lord of the Rings, Gandalf comes back. In ET, ET comes back from the dead and goes home. In The Neverending Story, the whole world comes back. Tragedy is lightened by redemption. The awful loss in this movie is not redeemed.

I don't criticize the movie for approaching such difficult topics. I do criticize the film's promoters for not even suggesting such tragedy in the promotion. Under the PG rating it is quite possible to do that.

If you hold a Christian faith, you'll also wonder why the movie takes a gratuitous swipe at God and those who hold religious beliefs.  You'll not leave with any real since of wonder at the fantasy world of Terabithia, because it simply has no depth.  Most of the action occurs at a small public school and in a depressing, poor family's home with the stereotypical overbearing father and distracted and aloof mother.

1589030,3,B00005JPL5,"The two main complaints about this film seem to be that a) it's depressing and b) the marketing campaign mislead audiences. Well, yeah. It's based on a book, and if they hadn't been faithful to the book's plot, there would have been just as many people complaining bitterly. So in a way, the filmmakers were in a double bind. That said, at least separate the film from the way it was marketed. Give the marketing people two stars and a spanking, since they led lots of people to think the movie was a lighthearted fantasy - but can we try to examine the movie on its own merits?

Many children and young adult classics feature a death, either of an animal or a human. Particularly if the book is a Major Award Winner, it doesn't just show how fun it is to be a child but grapples with serious issues. That's partly why it won the award and acclaim in the first place. The Narnia books are far from lighthearted fantasies either, although they can be read that way. They, too, examine friendship and betrayal. But they are set in a magic land, while ""Terabithia"" is set in the real world.

The actors in the new version of ""Terabithia"" all do a fantastic job, particularly the young ones, like Bailee Madison as Jess's spunky younger sister. The movie's storyline stuck so closely to the book that the invented scenes felt a little out of place. Perhaps that when it deparated from just showing the developing of two children's friendship, and put in special effects, it felt false. Even if they were brief, they seemed out of place, like the movie makers were trying to placate their young audience, who would presumably be unhappy without special effects.
The montages also grated on me, because they were so Hollywood and unnecessary. Why must every movie character break into an impromptu song and dance routine? And why did the treehouse have to look like set designers were competing for an Oscar? I don't know if kids still make treehouses anymore, but mine as a kid sure looked primitive in comparision.

In conclusion, it's a lot better than most kids' movies today - with nary a fart joke - but that's not saying much. There's no cussing or drinking, but there is the aforementioned death, which may upset sensitive viewers. I'd recommend talking over the movie with your kids afterwards if they seem upset.",1183593600,,2316,4.64390243902439
1589031,2,B00005JPL5,"now having read the book, i expected to be seeing something along the lines of ""Big Fish"" or ""Hook""..... full of vast fantasy visuals, heartwarming moments and the tear jerker ending.... unfortunately this one really didn't deliver like the others were able to.

the audience was conned into thinking this was the ""never ending story"" meets ""chronicals of narnia"". and if done correctly (or atthe very least with an extra half hour of fantasy world), it would have been both visually stunning and one to leave you with a warm feeling in the heart.

...unfortunately it was very badly adapted and as a result EXTREMELY dissapointing. and it fell short on both points

the fantasy aspects consisted of only 20 minutes (generously approximated) of footage spread throughout the middle of the movie in short 3-5 minute incriments.

they simply did not put enough emphasis on the fantasy aspect as you would be led to believe by all the press, and even the disney channel's ""commercial break, behind-the-scenes"" stuff only focused on the fantasy of it without giving the audience a fair chance to save the 7 bucks.

all they needed to make this movie to the top of the pack was an extra 30 minutes of fantasy footage and a ""sensitive content"" warning to spare families from the transformers movie fiasco of the 1980's (when the kids left the theater early, crying at the death of optimus prime)

now, it gets credit for following the book fairly closely, but it was without explaination,

they seemed to put in the key elements of the book without giving any exlaination as to why things were the way they were (ie: the teacher bringing him on the spontainious field trip).....they should have made up sometihng like ""the kid had been failing and this was extra credit...""etc. instead of making it a sketchy, grey area, uncomfortable situation. in the book there was no question.

i had to explain alot of things to my finacee who had not read the book, and both of us were dissapointed with the whole movie. i was expecting something more along the lines of ""big fish"" or ""hook""

but all we got from it is a potentially epic movie that really was badly made

and a distrust causing me to pay an extra $2 to rent a movie before purchasing it

1589032,5,B00005JPL5,"I watched ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" on a whim with my wife and daughter with little foreknowledge of the plot. I'd never read the Newbery Award-winning book by Katherine Paterson, and I'd seen only one trailer for the film, which left me with the impression it would be a Narnia knock-off. It's not.

I'm not dissing ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" which in its way was a remarkable film. But ""Terabithia"" didn't deserve the CGI-laden marketing campaign it received; far from a fantasy blockbuster, this is a deep and thoughtful movie that places substance over sparkle -- a rare treat in the sprawling field of youth-oriented theater. It ranks up there with one of my favorites, ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" which accomplished more with no special effects than most family-friendly movies could with a billion-dollar budget.

But I just can't shake ""Terabithia"" from my head, a fact owed mostly to the performance of AnnaSophia Robb. As Leslie, a spirited young girl with a fiery imagination and endless good cheer, AnnaSophia captured my heart. She's the kind of person you want to know when you're a child and, as my wife remarked midway through the film, she's the sort of young woman you'd be happy to see your daughter grow up to be.

An outsider despite her youthful good looks and family wealth, she finds her perfect match in Jesse (Joss Hutcherson), another outsider who has withdrawn into his art to escape a chilly home life and his own problems at school. Together, they discover a secret getaway that might seem like a fairly ordinary patch of woods to most people; to them, it's a magical world replete with fantastic creatures, hidden dangers and amazing triumphs. It's here the special effects intrude more than accentuate the film; the story would have benefited from a vaguer sense of Jesse and Leslie's own wonder. We don't need to see CGI creatures to believe that these two children do.

The strength here, besides outstanding performances from the two lead actors, is the impact of a story that knows no amount of fantasy can prevent real-life tragedies from occurring. And the tragedy here -- it's hard to write about it without giving it away -- slams into unsuspecting viewers like a sudden kick to the gut.

Parents of younger viewers should be prepared to have a long and serious talk with their children after this movie, but that's not a recommendation to avoid it. ""Terabithia"" deserves to be seen, discussed and seen again. (Although use some discretion; very young children should wait before seeing this.) My thanks to director Gabor Csupo, as well as writer Paterson, for giving kids something honest and real rather than another serving of high-energy fluff.

1589104,5,B00005JPL5,"I have been wanting to write a review for this film since I saw it for the first time, back in February. Though the main praises and controversies surrounding the story have been well covered by previous reviews on this site, this movie holds a personal significance that prompts me to share my own thoughts--although I must admit, I wasn't quite sure what to say about it.

I am a huge movie fan and have seen a generous number of them over the years, and for some reason, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is--in all genuine honesty--the very best, most beautiful, most heartwrenching work of art I have ever seen. Even if it might sound silly to regard a Disney film as something that profound and meaningful, it is certainly true that this particular movie had more time, effort, and sensitivity put into it than most others from the infamous Walt Disney empire.

After watching this movie a good 13 or 14 times (the sad thing is, I'm not even joking), it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why it has moved me in a way that no other film has. Yes, it has a powerful message, a well-executed emotional undercurrent, and some truly impressive acting, but I have seen other movies with similar qualities. I don't even remember being a HUGE fan of the accompanying book by Katherine Paterson, although my fourth grade teacher did read it to our class twelve years ago, and what I remember of it is the strong development of unique, positive characters who--at the tender age of 11 or so--receive a thing or two to think about concerning the ""realities of life,"" as several of us would call them.

Countless children's books have been adapted for the big screen over the years, among them including ""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" ""Madeline,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and ""Shiloh."" When you are transferring stories like these to film, it is so crucial to do it the right way, and sometimes, the end result doesn't really do much justice to the original author. One of the reasons I enjoyed ""Bridge to Terabithia"" so much is because it did not feel the need to conform the movie script to the things that today's society often deems as important, such domineering special effects and technology-driven means of having fun. This film allowed the main characters to highlight some of the personal creativity that all of us can take a lesson from, without making it too saccharine or unrealistic.

I don't really want to hash over too much of the actual plot, since I was a little late in writing my review and, as a result, have a slew of reviews before mine that provide those details. However, since the acting in this film was so powerful and memorable, I would like to comment a bit on that. There are very few actors who command a role so well that you cannot imagine another person as that character, but Josh Hutcherson was about as incredible in this movie as anyone could have possibly been. I saw him for the first time in ""Little Manhattan"" and thought he was a cute kid with a fresh face in the booming child star industry, but he has since metamorphosized into this amazing, amazing young actor. Simply put, he just seems to know what he is doing when he gets in front of the camera, and let me tell you, that can't be taught (and in fact, Hutcherson did not take any acting classes when he started out at the age of 9, and his career launched because he was basically a talented kid with a gift for portraying different characters). I've heard about actors who can indicate so much emotion with just their eyes and facial expressions, but Hutcherson absolutely has it down cold. I give him a lot of props for what he did with his character, and I predict he is going to do extremely well in his career (which should easily extend into adulthood, for a 14-year-old with this much natural talent).

As for the critical role of Leslie Burke, it has been said that child star sensation Dakota Fanning was allegedly offered the role first. I admit that I can envision her as the character (though many of you might disagree), but I also feel that the casting director's final choice was for the best, given the remarkable performance by AnnaSophia Robb. Always capable of delivering a strong acting job, Robb used her trademark charisma, beautiful smile, and ever-sparkling eyes to lend all the right elements to this dynamic character. Watching Leslie's strengths and personalities unfold in the plot, she reminded me so much of a friend I had back in grammar school, who was constantly making up stories and thriving in a rambling imagination that did not require a television set, an I-pod, or just hanging around indoors. You know the actors are doing their craft well when you can compare their characters with figures from real life, and for that, both Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are outstanding up-and-coming stars for being so young. (The obvious close friendship that they have off-screen is also clearly a contributing factor to what they created with Jess and Leslie in the movie.)

Also noteworthy in the cast is young Bailee Madison, whose performance as Jess's younger sister May Belle is about as refreshing as you could ask for in a movie. To see what I mean, just take a second to think about all the 5-year-old children you have seen in the movies over the years, and then ask yourself how many of them actually act like real kids? With her sweet, boisterous, pesky yet affectionate personality throughout the film, Bailee paints a nearly flawless image of any child her age that I would see in my own life, and I give her a lot of credit for that. In some cases, it's far better for a kid to just be herself in a movie, rather than acting too mature and ten years older than she really is, and that is what brings a sense of magic to Bailee's performance (not to mention the fact that you will be hard-pressed to find at least one scene of hers that doesn't make you well up, especially in the film's last thirty minutes). Zooey Deschanel, also, brings magic to the movie as the hip young music teacher, whose upbeat personality and genuine passion for her job reflects what is best about today's elementary educators.

Although the climax in ""Bridge to Terabithia"" packs a punch and will leave older audiences with a question or two to answer for the younger viewers, the culminating themes presented are anything but dark and depressing, as some other reviewers here have indicated. Since when is it not completely uplifting to watch kids overcome emotional hardship, recognize the impact of the friends around them, and use what they have learned to make efforts that they may not have considered before. I don't believe for a minute that Jess would have made the decision he did at the end of the film if it weren't for the ""close your eyes, but keep your mind wide open"" ideal that Leslie introduced to him in their friendship.

And so it goes. Many people have criticized the phenomenon of false advertisement and the unsettling plot threads that changed the film's originally perceived direction in a matter of seconds. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and their differing feelings about the movie are valid, but it's the idea of this being an inappropriate children's film that makes me want to ask the question: What exactly do we want to be teaching our kids, if not courage and compassion in the face of adversity? If we don't want them exposed to certain things, and if we want to protect them from what might be potentially sad or painful, then what opportunity is there to help them learn some of the life lessons that Jess Aarons did at the conclusion of the story? Yes, I understand that it's just a movie, and no kid is going to have a fully developed concept of reality simply by watching ""Bridge to Terabithia."" However, before we claim that the chosen themes are too much for children and should be replaced with something more along the lines of ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" we should consider what Katherine Paterson and the filmmakers are trying to communicate with a story like this. Trust me, the message is intended to be a positive one, achieved by working through the tough stuff and discovering a level of happiness that is different, but every bit as valuable.

This isn't to say that I would recommend showing this movie to a preschooler and eagerly filling her plate with all these ideas, but for a kid around the age of 9 or so, it is very much a ""children's film"" that can be enjoyed by the whole family and appreciated for occasionally uneasy but always important messages it shares. In addition, I am not trying to speak negatively of action ""Narnia"" type films for kids. Those are also good films with positive qualities of their own, and if that's what you like, then there is absolutely no problem with it. For the purpose of this particular movie, however, and what it is trying to say to contemporary audiences, I am just saying that it deserves a shot, and if you are looking for a film with kids who are good role models and creative ways of thinking that are encouraged, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is worth your time. If you watched it and didn't like it, or if you were upset by the marketing choices that the studio made with the preview trailers, then hey, what's the worst that can happen? You spent some money on a movie theater ticket, a video rental, or maybe even a DVD purchase that you weren't completely satisfied with--or maybe you watched it with your kids because you were expecting something else, and you had to have a conversation afterward that you weren't exactly thrilled about. Even then, though, in a situation like that, there are far more positive things than negative to derive from the film's ending.

With that in mind, I would like to give this film my strongest recommendation. Setting the plot aside, the DVD does have a nice set of special features, including a commentary by Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb--as well as one of the film producers Lauren Levine--that is both sweet and interesting to listen to, especially if you are a fan of these two stars. It is obvious that they are good friends off camera, which explains why their relationship was so convincing in the film. There is another commentary by the director, writer and producer; a short featurette about the special effects; and a second featurette where the cast teams up with educators and elementary school administrators all over the country to discuss the book's themes and provide valid reasons to introduce it in classroom curriculums. Lastly, there is a music video for the song ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open,"" performed by AnnaSophia Robb and sprinkled with some scenes from the movie. Although her actress-turned-singer approach is similar to what young movie starlets like Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan have done in their careers, AnnaSophia is a beautiful girl who, to her credit, appeared to give it her all with this song. Regardless of anything else, it is a nice tune, with lyrics that correlates perfectly with everything that this movie is about.

I am writing this because this film has reached me in a way that NO other movie has, and there is just something about it that makes me literally want to watch it over and over (which I have essentially been doing ever since I purchased the DVD). If you have not seen it, or if you are debating whether or not it is the right material for young ones, I really hope that you will at least rent it and give it a chance. Just because it is the best movie I have ever seen does not mean that I expect everyone else to agree, but if nothing else, it is a film with an impeccably chosen cast--a group of actors who obviously grasp the movie's purpose and play it out so effortlessly. When she wrote the book in the 1970's, Katherine Paterson wasn't sure if children could deal with the emotions of the story, but her editor knew that kids could, and she was right on target. Paterson did base the plot on a difficult experience that she encountered with her 8-year-old son many years ago, and after all, what hits home harder than a story that is true?",1183507200,2,12082,4.649040711277491
1589105,1,B00005JPL5,"Boy am I sorry I just wasted an hour and a half watching this movie, and I'm even sorrier that I let my kids see it.

This is not a movie for children, it is far too slow, boring, and sad.  Its not a movie for adults, it is far too juvenile and, well, dumb.

I kept waiting for the movie to get to a point - and it never does.  It meanders around in the very sad lives of two different adolescents - both terribly neglected by their parents in very different ways, both bullied, both living pretty sad lives.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, or for the film to reach some pinnacle where it all came together, and it never did.  Totally pointless.

The ""fantasy"" bits of the film [and they are *tiny* bits - not really worth even mentioning] are poorly done and just awful.

There is really nothing redeeming about this film, other than the fact that the two young actors who play the main characters do a good job acting - they just have pretty lame characters.  ALL the characters in the movie are really just characateurs - with no depth or meaning.  And most of them are ""bad"" in some way or other, from the insanely neglectful mother to the nasty abusive father to the mean bullies who beat up the other kids.

Anyway, its just a terrible movie and not worth anyone's time or money.  And please, parents, if you think you *might* want to show this movie to your children, preview it first.  I sure wish I had done that.",1183507200,35,1443,4.280442804428044

The fantasy is supposed to be secondary to the plot and it's very well done. I was very pleased when I watched it and had a good cry at the end, not once but twice.",1183507200,,418,4.160493827160494

You have AnnaSophia Robb staring (brilliantly I might add) in a flick about an adolescent with an overactive imagination... yet her imagination is depicted for all of 20 minutes in a 90 minute flick. The creatures are mindless cardboard cutouts, meant to represent real-life characters in their everyday world, but they wind up being boring parodies of themself.

The movie had great potential. Lots of area for conflict, what with a controlling ""down on his luck"" deadbeat dad and all. But in the end, the film would have been better if it had gone unmade. Or perhaps benefitted from about another half hour actually IN Terabithia.",1183420800,,714,4.852459016393443
1589109,3,B00005JPL5,"Introduction: If you're like me and knew nothing about the 07' release `Bridge to Terabithia' before watching the film I'm sure you were as surprised as I was. This is not a story about elves, fairies, trolls or any other such mythological beings of lore and legend. It is a coming of age tale about a young boy and girl, Jessie (Josh Hutcherson) and Leslie (Annasophia Robb) who develop a strong friendship centered around a fantasy kingdom of their own making.

Synopis: Terabithia lies in the woods adjacent to the homes of best friends Jessie and Leslie. It is just beyond a rushing stream which they traverse by swinging across using an old rope tied to a tree.  The two find this imaginary land a perfect escape from their daily problems revolving around school bullies, family difficulties and just growing up in general. Unfortunately even an imaginary kingdom can only hold out the harshness of reality for so long. The children are about to learn that some lessons in life are more difficult to accept than others.

Positives: The cinematography, sets, special effects and music are superior as you'd expect from a Disney feature. The children are also quite charming, especially the talented Annasophia Robb. She will definitely be heard from in the years ahead.  Lest I forget, Zooey Deschanel plays the part of Miss Edmunds their music/art teacher. Zooey's always a plus to anything she's in.

Negatives: Due to a rather dubious advertising campaign promoting this film as a fantasy adventure it has targeted an audience much too young for its slow pace and storyline. Further complicating matters, the characterizations portrayed in the movie are a little too stereotypical and one-dimensional to attract many adult fans. These two demographic miscues leave `Bridge to Terabithia' virtually a movie without an audience.

Postscript: So if you're looking for a film in the tradition of `The Chronicles of Narnia' or `The NeverEnding Story' be forewarned, this isn't it. On the other hand, if you're in search of something more in keeping with the mood and message of `Pay It Forward' this film's for you.

Rating: 3 1/2 Stars.",1183420800,11,2139,4.991573033707865
1589110,5,B00005JPL5,"Fresh from the success of their terrific first installment from the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series, Disney and Walden Media teamed up to deliver BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA, marketed as another fantasy film similar to LORD OF THE RINGS and NARNIA.  It even features visual effects by the award-winning New Zealand team behind both of those films.  But don't be misled by the marketing campaign--BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is only partially a fantasy film.  In other words, the ""magical"" elements make up merely about a fraction of its 96 minute running time.

What BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA actually is, however, is something quite different.  Based on a highly regarded children's book by Katharine Paterson (the script is co-written by the author's son), the movie is a contemporary family story about a young teenager, Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson), having problems with both his financially restrained family and nasty school bullies.  His sole talent is drawing, but what Jesse really wants is to be the fastest kid in his class, going so far to practice all summer long to the point where he wears out his shoes (he spends a majority of the movie wearing girls' sneakers).

Jesse's world is turned upside-down when Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), a very pretty and imaginative youngster, steps into his life.  At first, he is resentful about losing to her in a footrace, but before long, the two become close friends.  Every day they set off to a forest where they fabricate an fantasy world called Terabithia; here they can escape from their harsh realities and experience imaginative adventures on their own.  Simultaneously, they strike back at the school bullies, especially when one of them, who guards the girl's bathroom, robs from Jesse's showstealing and adorable little sister, May Belle (Bailee Madison).

For the first hour, BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is warm, gentle, old-fashioned Disney filmmaking with a touch of nostalgia.  The school scenes brought back memories for some of my early days when I was being picked on at one of the schools I went to.  There is a very amusing contrast between the two different teachers, the stern Mrs. Myers (Jen Wolfe), and the sprightly Miss Edmonds (Zooey Deschanel), whose pretty face and genial nature makes Jesse's heart throb.  It's Jessie and Leslie's friendship, however, that make BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA.  Both are very likeable and appealing, especially Leslie (thanks mainly to a lively and charismatic performance by Robb), and their relationship is genuine and touching without being romantic or sexual.  The scenes between them are lively and a joy to watch, mainly because both children are impeccably cast.  The scenes where they imagine Terabithia is simultaneously thrilling (thanks to the typically spectacular visual effects by Weta Workshop) and a lot of fun.  Meanwhile, little Madison gets many of the best lines and scenes as Jesse's sister, while Robert Patrick turns in a surprising performance as his pressured but ultimately softhearted father.

But things take an unexpectedly devastating turn in the final thirty minutes when a horrible tragedy strikes.  I won't reveal what it is (although fans of the book as well as other reviewers on here have already pointed it out), but you might want to consider having a box of Kleenexes during this part of the film.  The finale is not a ""happily ever after"" fairy tale ending, but a semi-sad but hopeful ending.  Not since POCAHONTAS or WILLIE THE OPERATIC WHALE has a Disney production featured a bittersweet ending, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA does this in a way that elevates the overall production into something more meaningful than what unsuspecting viewers may expect.

Actually, the best way to describe BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA is like a mixture of the fantasy and magical elements of NARNIA, LORD OF THE RINGS (although as mentioned, these scenes are only a small part of the film), the close friendship themes from CHARLOTTE'S WEB, as well as a brief sibling misunderstanding reminiscent of Miyazaki's MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO.  I never imagined that such a combination would be possible, but BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA proved me wrong.  It is refreshing to see a movie as deep and meaningful as this, but for a Disney movie it is arguably one of the very best in years.  Considering how mediocre their output has been (although NARNIA and PIRATES OF THE CARRIBBEAN have been happy exceptions), this is saying quite a lot.

Don't cross this BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA expecting another roller-coaster/good vs. evil fantasy adventure; when all is said and done, chances are you'll find yourself moved.  There are occasional flashes of special effects, of course, but at heart, it's a beautifully photographed, well directed, compellingly scripted, and strongly acted film that's not just a children's movie.  Even adults are sure to be enchanted.  This has become one of my favorite movies of all time, and I recommend it very highly.

The DVD release has an impeccable visual transfer and equally good sound mix.  There aren't a lot of extras, but what's there, including a commentary by the two leads and some brief featurettes, is fitting and pretty suitable for a film of this caliber.",1183334400,4,5177,5.08274231678487
1589111,1,B00005JPL5,"The previews tout this movie as 'A Fantasy film for the entire family'.
This is a lie.
There is very little 'fantasy' in the movie (I think maybe 15 minutes tops), and while the previews and commercials and trailers would paint it as a fun romp with two friends through a magical world, the truth is that it is a depressing and dark film. And I know at least one child that went to see the film and left crying because of it. Honestly, I think the producers should be sued for false advertising and misleading commercials. And I wish there was a lower rating than one star, because I would sorely like to give this a -5.",1183334400,26,620,4.262711864406779
1589112,2,B00005JPL5,"There's more than one bridge that is lacking in BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. Trying to ascertain who this movie is targeted at is one that many parents won't be able to cross, as well as gaps in almost all the fantasy elements.

Teasers and trailers would have most potential viewers believe it to be on-par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-Of-The-Rings/dp/B0001VL0K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord Of The Rings</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Narnia/dp/B000E8M0VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Narnia</a>.  Perhaps not in production standards but at least in the story's fantasy elements. Not so. The screenplay and direction seemed to be at odds with the story, trying to infuse more childlike wonder and imagination but being stymied by coherency and some very shabby acting and dialogue.

Bridge To Terabithia is based on Katherine Patterson's Newberry Award winning children's book by the same name. Given a wobbly structure by picture standards rather than anything approaching a solid children's story, the film fails not only in entertaining visuals but also in that the themes that run through Patterson's books are never given their comeuppance. We can see them more than feel them, which is a bummer considering how important some of the issues Patterson covers in her novels.

Josh Hutcherson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zathura/dp/B000DBHX4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zathura</a>) stars as Jesse Aarons, a middle school boy with adult responsibilities on his parents' farm. Living in the boondocks, Jesse is the [...] of bullies and jokesters at his school. Finding comfort in his drawings, Jesse immerses himself in them, trying to escape life's cruel realities. He's a loner even amongst his family, where his sisters and parents rarely acknowledge his existence. Then one day a young girl arrives at his school and opens Jesse's mind to the unseen. AnnaSophia Robb is Leslie Burk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), the daughter to fiction writers who takes a liking to Jesse. Running into the backwoods near their homes, Jesse and Leslie form a friendship based on escapism and fantasy. But the worlds begin colliding as Jesse and Leslie take their made-up world and incorporate its sense of right and wrong on the real one. The results are no big surprise. The bullying stops. Respect is achieved. Toughness grows.

The largest problem with the story is that its target audience is a complete mystery. The dialogue is junior enough to be in league with films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Labyrinth/dp/B00000K3D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Labyrinth</a>&nbsp;but the themes are often adult, including extrapolations on the need for God and religion as well as how to deal with an emerging sexual attraction for a teacher, and the death of a student. These dichotomies were just too broad to be ...um ...bridged.

The other issue is the out-and-out misconception that this is some sort of visually stunning fantasy movie. It isn't. These elements are few and often incongruous with the trailers that littered screens before its release or on parallel DVDs that beg you to rent or buy this film, too.

Bridge To Terabithia isn't for young kids and it will bore and/or anger adults to the point where they'll want to banish the DVD posthaste from whence it came.",1183334400,10,3630,6.091976516634051
1589113,4,B00005JPL5,"While Bridge To Terabithia is a good effort by any standard, the story itself hardly rises above a typical Hallmark channel offering. Based on the book by Katherine Paterson, it tells the story of two Middle School (then Junior High School) children that are treated like outcasts in their school: Jesse, played by Josh Hutcherson (Zathura), and Leslie, played by AnnaSophia Robb (Charlie And The Chocolate Factory). Add to that the fact that Jesse is alienated from his overly strict dad, played by Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), and his unsympathetic sisters - except for his youngest sister, May Belle, played by Bailee Madison. She almost worships the ground he walks on.

To deal with their misery, Jesse and Leslie escape into the woods and into a world of imagination, which Jesse feeds with his artwork and Leslie with her writing. On the other side of the river from their homes, they build a kingdom they call Terabithia. There, they find an abandoned tree house, which they renovate and believe turns into their castle whenever they visit. Every afternoon, they cross the river and, together, rule the Kingdom of Terabithia.

As their friendship and imaginations grow, they soon have to confront the residents of their imaginary world: horrible harry birds and giant squirrels that attack them mercilessly. There is also a dark prince, whose shadow they see lurking among the trees from time to time. And there is a giant.

Outside of each other, the two kids have few friends, except for their music teacher, Miss Edmonds, played by Zooey Deschanel (Elf), who takes an interest in them and their abilities. One day, Miss Edmonds invites Jesse to take a field trip with her to an art museum. The events of that day change everything in Jesse and Leslie's world. I love the scene between Jesse and his dad in each other's arms in the woods as a result of those events. And I love what Jessie does at the end for his sister, May Belle.

It's a good cast, and a good story - but it's not exceptional. Gabor Csupo does a good job directing, and Jeff Stockwell and David Paterson do a fine job adapting the book. While the story is timely, in that it deals with a subject that almost every boy faces at that age - alienation from his dad - and almost every student faces at a new school, it is somehow mundane. You would expect the imaginary world to lift the story to an otherworldly level, but it doesn't. Even with animation by the same people who worked on Chronicles Of Narnia and Lord Of The Rings, there just isn't enough of it to do the trick. We spend far too much time in the real, and sometimes boring, world of Junior High.

I love the relationships, especially between Jesse and Leslie, Jesse and May Belle, and Jesse and his dad. That is the best part of the film. I was disappointed when I watched the extra features to learn that the creatures in Terabithia were supposed to be adaptations of different ones of the students who persecuted Jesse and Leslie, because that didn't come across at all. I didn't see any resemblance.

This was a good effort, but a modest story.

1589134,4,B00005JPL5,"This is a really good movie.

I had only ""heard about"" this movie and that it was good.  So without knowing about it's dark side, I planned an evening to watch it at home, with my wife & two of my daughters (23 & 21).  After a mostly lighthearted beginning, most of the way through the movie, there is a dark turn of events.  We were all kind of in shock and my daughters were crying.

I've heard that the BOOK is widely read around the [....] or so, so many kids are familiar with the story line.  I WOULD NOT recommend it for viewers younger than about 10.

There are a numnber of good elements.  It shows the power of imagination.  The friendship between Jess and Leslie is powerful.  Teachers are portrayed in a POSITIVE light.  And in the end, Jess builds a bridge and introduces his sister to his and Leslie's magical place.

The ""dark turn"" should provide a talking point for parents of teens.  This is without regard to your personal beliefs.  Religion plays only a very small part in this movie.  You should take the opportunity to talk with your kids about the topic.  (I'm avoiding mentioning the exact nature of the dark turn to avoid being a ""spoiler"".

It shows that there is good in many people and places where most people would never be open enough to look.  People may surprise you so don't judge others too harshly.  Everyone deserves a second chance.

If you are expecting Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia constant special effects, you will likely be disappointed because Terabithia is all about Imagination and encouraging all of us to use it.  It teaches us to have a great life philosophy of keeping our minds wide open and not dwelling on the bad things that happen to us but instead focusing on the positive and appreciating our blessings.

Great gift/viewing for any child/teen/young adult and for the child in all of us.  Josh Hutcherson is a naturally gifted actor and AnnaSophia Robb is as well. They are both excellent role models.  They have a very believable friendship together on screen and I believe off screen.  I highly recommend this for friends and families to watch together and be taken in by its wonder.

I had NO IDEA what was coming.  I was as shocked as Jess was.  Wow.

One day jess goes to the museam with his music teacher who has a young boy has a crush on her, so of course he dint want to invite leslie along. well anyways for some reason i don't lknow why leslie wants to go to their get away place and of course she ends up dieing by drowing. this is the point where in the movie your like this is what i dint want to see or what i payed for and yes the tears will start pouring.i was thinking why whould the auther want to mess with your head by killing one of the most loved cachters in the moive. in the end of the moive you relize why i won't give the rest away its anther 15 mintues of the movie the whole death part.
so im guess what im saying this movie is nothing what it was petrayed about in the prviews its not really a fanstasy moive its more of a movie about comeing to life and love and frind ship and dealing with tradagy.
if you just end up watchig this molvie becuase you want to see a good faqntasy flick you will end up dispointed and if you watch it with young children be prepared for a long talk about death with you kids after.
I highly don't resomend watching the special feature about comeparing the book to the movie. if you do if you haven't cried yet you will be. this when i started crying becuase i will give it way right now leslie and jess are real people. this book was writen for davied(jess in the movie and book) the authers son after leslie yes her really name end up geting strock by lighting on vaction and ends up dieing. the auther then wrtoe the book to deal with this tradgy and to help deal with it.
so in closeing go watch this molvie then read the book like im going to do or vice versa",1182988800,2,2704,4.075046904315197

This is definitely a family film that everyone will find enjoyable.  However, since it does (at least most of the time) closely follow the book of the same name by Katherine Paterson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/0064401847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>), if you've read it you'll know that the tears will come.

As a fantasy film, it's on the light side.  This isn't the kids' version of a huge fantasy epic such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>, so don't go into it expecting to see tons of special effects.

However, as a ""struggling to fit in"" story that features two middle-grade students, this movie scores high.  This is the type of ""bullies-crush on the teacher-surviving middle school"" story that will never be out of fashion.

I was very surprised at the limited amount of the fantasy world that is in the movie.  I THOUGHT the movie would be 98% fantasy world, 2% ""real"".  I was very wrong. From the previews, did anyone else think like I did?  Albeit, I did know that Leslie died before watching the movie, but I just assumed it would be at the end of the movie.  Not 2/3 of the way through where I would be crying my eyes out the last 3rd of the movie.  I can honestly say the movie was VERY good, but I don't ""enjoy"" what I call ""cry movies"" and will probably never watch it again...just like I'll never watch Old Yeller or re-read ""Where the Red Fern Grows"".  I don't like seeing kids neglected, bullied or having to deal with childhood death.

1589199,4,B00005JPL5,"Before I begin, all the religious SOCIOPATHS on here who are butchering this beautiful film should be ashamed of themselves. The part of the film they are so angry about is when the little girl says that if you don't believe in the bible you go to hell, and then Leslie says (to paraphrase) that God is probably too busy creating the rest of the world every day than to be sending people to hell. Of course, had any of the nut jobs on here ever read a book, they would be able to keep things in proper context. One of the psychopaths who negatively reviewed this movie said it promotes teenage sex and drug use. The closest these two kids come to sex is an awkward hug they give each other when the boy gives the girl a pet dog. People like Joan Badalian should be ashamed of themselves. There isn't even a hint of the basic idea of drug use in this whole movie. The only rough element in it is what happens to leslie which may be damaging for some small children, but this movie will cause your children no harm.
If you are looking for a charming movie for your kids to watch or to view as a family, pick this film up because it is a beautiful, well done piece of work. Joan Badalian i guess was offended at the notion of God not sending a little girl to hell, which, to me is the most evil and heinous thought any low grade waste of life can have. Hell is reserved only for the wicked and nuts like Joan Badalian punch their own card by writing viscious propaganda like they did.

The girl is the prettiest young actress out there...and she plays an ugly and unpopular girl, umm...a fat and ubnoxious girl is the prettiest girl of the film in this movie?  Strange....there needs to be a young Thora Birch like girl...like ghostworld and Dungions and Dragons girl... somebody like a young Cristina Ricci or Wynona Ryder, not because they all have darker personalities, but like Ms. Beautrix Potter, she needs to be a bit of an eccentric to pull off the imagionation, not a young and bored beauty queen who happens to be as imagionative as Tolkien or George Lucas...she nor he looks like George Lucas.

Now, the 'Bridge' to Tarabithia never opens truely until she gets him to renounce his faith in God...how sweet, their imagionations are himpered by a religious fatih...and two good looking and pratty young kids....seems like the film is promoting free love...a boy and girl...many hippy themes...hmmm....seems more like propaganda for sex and drug use amonge teens...for what else do athiest teenagers do but have sex and do drugs in the name of 'if there is no hell, oh well.""  I mean, those who believe in God are not perfect either, but Athiesm actually promotes this kind of behavior...i.e., Angelina Joli promotes her athiesm, and she has done so many nude lesbian movies it is not funny.

First of all, just because a film is produced by Disney, it does not mean it has to be a ""they lived happily ever after"" kind of film.  In addition, it is foolish to buy a movie based on a classic piece of literature if you have never read the book and have no idea of what to expect.  Read the book if you want to complain about the marketing.

Beautiful and touching film.",1182729600,3,489,4.170212765957447
1589233,5,B00005JPL5,"Yes -- as many of the earlier reviews here have already given away -- the girl dies. But if you know that going in, watching ""Bridge to Terabithia"" can be a terrific experience. My husband and I sat down with our 13-year-old daughter the other night to watch it and, though we were all crying at the end, it got to us like few other films ever have. This well-grounded movie combines many solid messages about what it's like to be a creative boy, an independent-thinking girl, and, yes, have a loved one suddenly pass away. The girl's death, by the way, is handled with care. The event happens between scenes, so there's no sudden panic, scream or shocking visual. It's actually more affecting that way.

The portrayal of the imagined fantasyland of Terabithia does have some good effects, but they are in no way the point of the film and have little to do with its plot. In fact, the movie may have been better without them. The film is helped by the already solid acting chops (and engaging good looks) of young leads Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb, as well as those of 8-year-old supporting actress Bailee Madison. They all seem like real kids.

As for bonus features, the DVD has two audio commentaries. In the first, the film's main producer, director and writer team up for an interesting, if casual, scene-by-scene analysis. In the second, the young teenage actors spend 90 minutes chatting away like, well, young teenagers. If kids listen to it they'll learn where Disney stuck in a Hidden Hannah Montana. Totally killer!

A 15-minute featurette ""Behind the Book"" focuses on the novel instead of the movie, a nice break from Disney's typical self-focused extra. Even a second featurette, the six-minute ""Digital Imagination: Bringing Terabithia to Life,"" starts with an interview with the book's author, Katherine Paterson. There's also a four-minute music video of AnnaSophia Robb singing ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open."" The song's nice and the girl is not a bad singer, but the video is mainly just clips from the film mixed in with shots of the young star standing in front of a microphone.",1182729600,5,2102,4.801104972375691
1589234,4,B00005JPL5,"I'm surprised that the MPAA gave Bridge to Terabithia a PG rating....Not because I think that it should have been given a more restrictive rating, but because the MPAA is so conservative these days with movies for kids that might be ""too deep"" or might ""make a child sad"".

Bridge to Terabithia is indeed a kid's movie, with a couple of kids (Josh Hutcherson & AnnaSophia Robb) turning in a couple of moving performances. My oldest was captivated. My middle-guy thought that it as ""awesome"". When I asked my youngest if it was a good movie...well...I got a ""no"". But my youngest was definitely as captivated as my oldest. In fact, this was originally a rental for us, but we picked up the Blu-ray edition after my youngest was so upset when I returned the rental.

Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;, My Girl&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Girl/dp/0800177991/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Girl</a>&nbsp;or Old Yeller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-Yeller-Vault-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)</a>&nbsp;.

Bridge to Terabithia is much more about childhood issues and dealing with them than fantasy and folklore. It's also a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/0064401847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>&nbsp;.) This movie will also present that life is not always so rosy at times, so if you're the type that wants to hide that fact from your kids then you might be disappointed with Bridge to Terabithia.

In the film, one of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ultimately ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, ""Oh no, what's going on here?"" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.

Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.",1182729600,18,3164,5.723404255319149
1589235,3,B00005JPL5,"This review tells a bit about the plot, so stop if you don't want the ending spoiled. This movie is represented as a fantasy adventure; however, it is not. The movie is about two middle school aged children, who develop a friendship and a world of imagination in which to go. The movie changes direction about two-thirds of the way through. These two factors combine to make the climax of the movie very sad indeed. With that being said, the movie was good in its way. A girl teaches a boy to use his imagination not only to have fun and relax, but to face the challenges of life. The girl and the boy become good friends.

Thus the movie is about friendship, empathy, family, imagination and loyalty. The acting is good. Josh is a little wooden. Robb is delightful as the girl. The little sister was very good.  The CGI was restrained and well done. The plot is ok.

The end is good. It is hard to figure out who this movie is targeted for. I thought it felt too young for an adult. High school kids wouldn't be interested.

My Grandaughter kept saying ""she isn't dead, watch I know she isn't really dead"" and I had to be the one to try and explain it to her.  Was it really necessary to have that happen?

Personally, as a family movie, we would watch something less depressing - mind, I find ""Damage"" an exceptional movie, but I wouldn't want my kid to watch it.  That is our choice, and movies need to labeled better.

As for being labeled a fantasy, this movie falls very short.  This is a film about friendship, and the lively imagination of children, and the worlds they can create when at play.  It is also a film about loss and grief.  But at no time does this film transport you into the fantasy world the children imagined, and bring it to life for the audience.  Instead it ends up being more like ""Ordinary People"" or ""In the Bedroom"", neither movie that I find stimulating, especially for children.

In reality this movie does not offer many special effects, although the special effects it does have are very well done. The problem I have with this movie is that Disney has taken every single special effect (like I said, not many) and marketed this movie in television commercials and trailers as something it is definitely not. Disney has intentionally misled audiences with the advertising of this film.

Bridge to Terabithia is about imagination, but also about some very serious and sad topics we have to deal with in life. Disney did a huge mis-service to the film by misprepresenting it. Had they approached their marketing in a truthful and honest way...which goes hand-in-hand with the basic concepts of Bridge to Terabithia (truth, honesty, self-reflection) it would have been wonderful...and prepared audiences more to deal with the very human but also very tragic themes the film explores. This is a film for children and adults, but all will be disappointed when the film ends because they were probably expecting what I was expecting - a romp and beautiful fantasy...not an exploration of serious problems and death.

I like the film, but I feel cheated because it was represented as something it is not by the money-focused folks at Disney. Because of this I give the film two stars and encourage you to rent it....not to buy it...because most people will only want to see this movie once.",1182643200,9,1491,4.912698412698413

So, I was anxious to see BTT hoping for the same vivid special effects.  Although the effects are not as numerous in BTT, you will not be disappointed.  As suggested in the book, quite a bit is left up to your own imagination.

Any adult, or child, who suffered or is suffering through junior high at the hands of bullies, can definitely relate to this movie.  It's the story of Jess, an outcast at school and with his family, who loves to draw.  His imagination gets a boost when he becomes friends with Leslie, the new girl at school who keeps her mind wide open!  They build a world out of their imagination where they rule.

The brief discussion of religion between Jess and Leslie was quite a surprise for a Disney movie, but definitely not offensive.  All of the children are so adorable, and you may find yourself a bit teary eyed.  I know I did.

It is by far one of my favorite books. I was so glad when I found out that they were making a movie about it, cautiously though, knowing how many books have been butchered by movies these days. Fortunately, though - the writers, producers, directors of this film got it right! Yes, it is sad and it may not be for youngsters, but it is still a deeply moving, well-done movie about friendship. If you have not read the book, I HIGHLY suggest reading it before viewing the film. It will make a world of a difference judging by some of these reviews. I am now reading the book again after seeing the movie because it is such a great and powerful story.

It's also that first day of school when he meets Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb).  She's his new neighbor.  When she beats Jesse at races during recess, he's less then happy.  But slowly the two build a friendship.

It's Leslie's idea to create a magical kingdom.  In Terabithia, anything they can imagine goes.  They are the rulers and must fight against the evil creatures of the realm.  Slowly, Leslie's imagination rubs off on Jesse, and he begins to enjoy these games as well.  Their friendship even helps them deal with the bullies they face at school.  But will it help when tragedy strikes?

This movie is based on a classic children's novel.  Those familiar with the book need not worry, this movie sticks closely to the book.  For those not familiar with the book, that means pay no attention to the ads you may have seen because this is not a fantasy movie.  The majority of the movie is spent in the realities of fifth grade life.

And it has a very bitter sweet ending.  If you are looking for a light film, you will be disappointed.  But it is well worth enduring the sorrow for the beauty of the ending.

The original novel was written and set in the 1970's but the movie is given a modern setting.  It only affects little things, and the heart of the story remains unchanged.

The acting is top notch, too.  AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both newcomers and are perfectly believable as the leads.  The other stand out is Bailee Madison as Jesse's younger sister.

My only complaint comes from comparing the movie to the book, a situation in which the movie almost always loses.  I read the book for the first time last month, and was deeply moved by it.  The characters were rich and there was lots of depth to the story.  Naturally, that can't be achieved in a movie.  If the book wasn't so fresh in my mind, I would have enjoyed this version more.  This is a minor complaint, however, since I was as deeply moved by the ending of the movie as I was the book.

It is bitter due to the real-life tragedy this story is based on and sweet because of the inherent innocence of our two protagonists. It's hard not to love these characters. Adults will find themselves reminiscing about their own childhoods. Children however, will probably be slightly traumatized by the subject matter here. Fantastic film. Highly recommended!

That is the only reason that I gave it 3 stars.  Sitting on a bench at a park and watching all the kids interact is similar and much more entertaining than this movie.  If you want a fun trip to a world of fantasy, don't rely on this movie to get you there.  If you want a nice story about friendship, this movie is for you.",1182384000,2,831,4.182389937106918

That being said for older children I think it is a very good story. It teaches some good lessons and has a lot of imagination. The only part that concerned me was what seemed like a small slight at the Christian religion. The movie is a good place to have a small say on it, but I don't feel it should preach any particular view.

All that said, I think the movie, by itself, was probably a 4 star. The movie with the marketing attached, misleading me into buying a DVD that our kids aren't even ready for deserves a 2 star. I split the difference.",1182384000,7,785,4.261744966442953
1589311,4,B00005JPL5,"I'm surprised that the MPAA gave Bridge to Terabithia a PG rating....Not because I think that it should have been given a more restrictive rating, but because the MPAA is so conservative these days with movies for kids that might be ""too deep"" or might ""make a child sad"".

Bridge to Terabithia is indeed a kid's movie, with a couple of kids (Josh Hutcherson & AnnaSophia Robb) turning in a couple of moving performances. My 8 year old was captivated. My 6 year old thought that it as ""awesome"". When I asked my 4 year old if it was a good movie...well...I got a ""no"". But my 4 year old was definitely as captivated as my 8 year old.

Here's the thing: They just don't make movies like Bridge to Terabithia for kids anymore; or, if they do, it usually gets smacked with a PG-13. But Bridge to Terabithia is no more frightening or deep than The Wizard of Oz&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;, My Girl&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Girl/dp/0800177991/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Girl</a>&nbsp;or Old Yeller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-Yeller-Vault-Disney-Collection/dp/B00005RRG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old Yeller (Vault Disney Collection)</a>&nbsp;.

Bridge to Terabithia is a tale of what tweens might do to have fun--use their imagination--in their spare time....They dream of a magic place where they are The King and Queen of Terabithia. (The movie is based on the 1977 children's novel of the same name by Katherine Paterson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridge-to-Terabithia/dp/0064401847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridge to Terabithia</a>&nbsp;.)

One of the kids is even invited by his teacher (Zooey Deschanel) on what ends up being a private excursion to a museum; and I must say that during the scene my wife and I looked at each other and we were like, ""Oh no, what's going on here?"" Well...nothing....The female teacher took the young male student (who indeed clearly had a crush on the teacher) to a museum. Nothing else. It just goes to show what a different world we live in today where you (sadly) can't trust a situation like that from the days of Old Yeller where Barney Fife might show up and not arrest the teacher, but instead suggest that they all stop by the local ice cream parlor on the way home.

Bridge to Terabithia is a very good movie...a family movie...that might frighten at times; it might make a kid think at times; and it might make a kid cry here and there.",1182384000,3,2723,5.848866498740554

Obviously I am not the only one to notice the quantum gap between what we saw in the trailer and what we got in the film, but I have seen my fair share of stupid ad campaigns for pretty good movies and in the final analysis that is what this film is, so forget the stupid trailers.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" is not a special effects movie but a movie about a special friendship.  Jesse Arons (Josh Hutcherson, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zathura/dp/B000DBHX4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zathura</a>"") is taunted, teased, and bullied at school and takes refuge in his drawing, but his family is oblivious to his artistic talents.  Then Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Because-of-Winn-Dixie/dp/B0009NZ2KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Because of Winn-Dixie</a>"") walks into his life as the new girl in class.  As extroverted as Jess is introverted, Leslie turns out to be a kindred spirit whose talent is for writing.  At first Jess treats her as horribly as everybody else as the new girl assumes the spot at the bottom of the school's pecking order.  But they have too much in common and they become friends, doing everything together, including exploring the woods and finding the special place she named Terabithia where parents and chores, bullies and kid sisters, can be left behind.

There is no need to say more because you deserve to discover how this one plays out for yourself.  The cast features Robert Patrick as Jesse's overworked father and Zooey Deschanel as the kid's music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, but this film favors the kids over the adults while making it clear they live in the real world, even with the wonders of Terabithia.  I especially like the way the plotline regarding the schoolyard bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton), plays out, even more than what Josh and Leslie come up with for Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) and Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) in Terabithia.  My understanding is that the screenplay by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell is quite faithful to the book, although obviously those who have read it would know far better than me.  But at least now I know what the book is about and why it is one of the most beloved children's books of the last thirty years.",1182211200,16,3545,5.779270633397313
1589366,4,B00005JPL5,"Magnificently adapted from the acclaimed Katherine Paterson novel, ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is an enticingly unique children's fantasy. Outstanding performances by child stars AnnaSophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson drive the film, which delves into the world of imagination, fantasy and the circumvention of unpleasant realities. The staggeringly tragic elements in the film are almost too morose for younger audiences, but brings with it meaningful lessons in morality, values and acknowledgement for the importance of friendships.

The fastest kid in the fifth grade, Jess (Josh Hutcherson), reluctantly befriends the new student Leslie (AnnaSophia) when they realize they are not only neighbors, but comparable outsiders in their class. Encountering the typical struggles of elementary school kids, such as bullies and not fitting in with the ""cool"" kids, Leslie teaches Jess to use his imagination more frequently to escape whatever unpleasantries he might face. Together they convert a debilitated, abandoned tree-house deep in the forest into their own magical kingdom named Terabithia, and they visit it each day to daydream and live out their fantasies as noble rulers of their realm. When tragic events disrupt their peaceful play, newfound lessons in believing the impossible help them overcome utter heartbreak.

The two stars AnnaSophia Robb (who you may recognize from 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) and Josh Hutcherson are markedly phenomenal and embody Paterson's characters with such authenticity and sincerity that your eyes will be glued to the screen. You feel for these characters, relate to them and recognize their reasoning. Their adolescent imaginations are inspirational and memorable, as they realize that conceiving a fictitious world to govern is a harmless escape from reality that fuels their creativity and happiness. Several of the other characters, including their classmates and Josh's father (Robert Patrick, the T-1000) are properly stereotypical; we see every familiar niche from school, including the bullies, the cool kids, and the nerds. These patterned figures enhance our understanding for Leslie and Jess, solidify their outsider stances, and justify nearly all of their actions. Zooey Deschanel plays Miss Edmunds, the music teacher, who classically and humorously creates a love triangle for Jess. Entranced by his teacher, and later blaming himself for inconsiderately trying to spend time with her as opposed to Leslie, this innocent crush adds to the realism of the 11-year-old's mindset.

In the film, Leslie dubs their imaginary kingdom ""Terabithia"" which is supposedly a made-up name devised on the spur of the moment. However, one of the aspects the film leaves out, probably to avoid any comparisons to the incredibly popular Chronicles of Narnia, is that Leslie has read and enjoyed Narnia and other C.S. Lewis stories, and designs her kingdom around the ground-rules set forth in those books. One of Lewis' stories contains an island named Terebinthia, which Leslie purportedly would have subconsciously borrowed when naming the magical land. (There is also a tree found in the bible called a terebinth tree, so Lewis may not have been all that original either.)

For anyone who has read the novel and enjoyed it, this film is an amazingly faithful adaptation, and will certainly appeal to those existing fans. More interestingly though, will be the reactions of newcomers who are not yet familiar with the events of the story. It's difficult to discuss the film without giving away major plot points, and ironically the filmmakers sent out publications and press kits with written pleas to journalists not to give away those monumental details. The story is well worth reading, and the movie well worth watching, targeting families and more specifically elementary school students. My advice is to simply see the film for yourself, as it is loaded with thought-provoking themes and morals that may be difficult to discuss and easier to watch through the use of this revelatory visual delight.

1589370,5,B00005JPL5,"Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia YA 1977 novel is a classic. One I never read when I was a kid, but I understand it's quite beloved and indeed sacred to some -- not the least of which is Paterson's son David, for whom the book was written and who also shares a screenwriting credit on the film. So, everything had to be just right: from the human-being casting, to the use of special effects which help bring the fantasy kingdom of Terabithia to life.

When the movie came out on the big screen earlier this year every trailer, TV spot and preview showed trolls, ogres, and magical, spontaneously self-buildings bridges springing up. It looked like Lord of Rings on kiddie-safe steroids. But the movie itself isn't about all that, which understandably wrought a bit of a backlash from those not familiar with the novel's very real, grounded themes about regular kids and their very normal day-to-day struggles.

The story follows Jesse (Josh Hutcherson), a fifth-grader who's not terribly popular. There is nothing wrong with him, but there's nothing ""right"" either. He's not outgoing, rich or popular, but he is something of an athlete -- that is, until the new student in his class, a slip of a girl named Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) beats him in a footrace. At first, he holds a grudge but before long the two dreamy, artistic kids become best friends, and allies against the school's bully brigade. Their secret refuge is a tree-house in the woods, a place Leslie calls Terabithia. The children imagine all sorts of wondrous and scary things there, in an attempt to free their minds from their otherwise troubled lives (Jesse's parents are struggling financially, while only-child Leslie feels neglected by her busy dad and mom).

Since Disney optioned this book, you can bet there's some tears to be jerked -- but it's an ultimately uplifting, beautiful and honest portrayal of life-lessons learnt in childhood. Hutcherson and Robb are very well-cast and their acting is pretty much flawless (none of the ""cutesy"" or ""obnoxious"" child-actor antics here). Real kudos go to director Gabor Csupo, who not only grasped (as best as I can tell) the source material, but added cinematic dimension to it for those who are not familiar with the novel. (I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with his next project, The Moon Princess -- based on a book I did read, and loved!, as a child: The Little White Horse, by Elizabeth Goudge).

The DVD offers an array of extras (and nice supplements, such as closed captions for the hearing-impaired), my favorite of which was a solid featurette on Katherine Paterson's Bridge to Terabithia novel. It offers interviews not only with the author herself, but insight from teachers who've assigned the book to their classes over the years, plus excerpts from the text and illustrations.

AnnaSophia Robb is amazing; she lights up the screen with her smile and endearing performance. Warning: this movie is a tearjerker, and especially for young children, can be somewhat intense.

I have to admit, I never read the book, and I'm sure that the book was engrossing, but the movie version was depressing and dark.  If you are expecting a lot of fantastic out of this world creatures, and happy times with escapism, look elsewhere.  The few times that the movie starts to show interesting creatures and go into this hidden world, becomes short lived and is jerked back into depressing reality.  The main character is unhappy throughout the film and has relationships which end either tragically or unfullfilled, so there is no happiness there.  At the last five minutes of the film, he tries to escape to this land of abstract creatures and we get to see all these bizarre creatures of this fantasy world, but by then, the movie is over.

I have to say this is probalby the best movie i've ever seen. It was EXTERMLY hard not to cry when Leslie died. For some reason when she walked away and smiled at jess on the rainy day I knew she was going to die. Sure enough She did. There are a few parts in this movie that were amazing, ill list.

1. Leslie Dieing- Shows that death is random and life is unexpected.

2. Religion Discussion- In the back of the truck, they discuss Christianity, When the little girl says something like ""If you don't belive in the bible God will send you to hell"" and leslie says things like ""you are forced to go to church, and you hate it, well i don't have to go, and i think its beatuiful. and ""I don't think God goes around damning people to hell, i think he is to busy with this (refering to nature) and i also love the little girls comments about damning people to hell, that shows how Christianity is much to harsh and difficult to understand for young children.

3. The Dark King was actually Jess's Dad

4. Jess's Dad tells him there is no way God is sending that little girl to hell

The movie shows how the children deal with reality through fantasy, something jess's father doesent understand. This movie is amazing. I was expecting a stupid fun kid movie, and i got the hardest hitting ""kids"" movie ive ever seen. If you have kids you are going to have some explaining to do to them.

Having read the novel, it was a grave disappointment because there were far too many disparities:  The initial meeting of Jess and Leslie was completely rewritten.  Ellie was absent from the story,  May Belle looked like a ""healthy"" third-grader (rather than a ""skinny"" first-grader), Joyce Ann was an ""actual"" baby (a diaper-wearing, able-to-fit-on-Momma's-hip size baby), and Miss Edmunds and Mrs. Meyers were morphed into one teacher (Annette O'Toole's character).  This movie varied so distantly from the novel that, had I not preview it first (which I always do), I would have been thoroughly embarrassed showing it to my students.  We did a comparison/contrast, and found pitifully few similarities beyond the names of the major players.

My positive: It was short enough to view in one class period.  I used it to prove to my students that ""watching a movie"" does not equal ""reading a book.""  They (four classes of 10-12 year olds) received that message loud and clear, by their own admission.",1178841600,3,1153,5.085106382978723
1589481,5,B00005JPL5,"I must admit I did not discover the book until the early 1990s as part of a children's Lit class.  Even so, the haunting tale of Jess and Leslie stayed with me ever since, and I was both concerned and delighted when I heard of the Disney version's coming release.  Someone earlier said the trailers were misleading, and they were but intentionally so.  Anyone who had read the book prior to seeing this tale KNOWS it's not about the special effects.  So where does that leave us? With a slew of unbelieveable performances.

  I knew of Robert Patrick mainly through the Terminator 2 and X-Files, so I wondered if he could pull off a role like this.  The man is magnificent as Jess' father. Rough, rugged, and tough, he looks like a man who's fought with the devil and spit in his eye...yet he is tender and caring towards his son when tragedy strikes...and not one scene of it feels false or fake.

  What is there to say about Zooey Deschanel (sp?) except that the woman is an immense, and so far, undertapped talent.  Discovered in Will Farrell's ""Elf"", she once again shines as the school's music teacher.

  The film, however, belongs to Jess and Leslie, and the supporting actors obviously knew and understood this.  There is not a single adult that gives a heavy-handed performance. From the girls who play Jess' teenage sisters, all the way to his initially mean-spirited teacher at the beginnings of the film, each one shines in his or her own right.  Their performances are moving and just right.

  The stars are magnificent: Josh and AnnaSophia are perfectly cast.  I know several people thought Miss Robb was a little too ""modern"" or ""perfect-looking"" for the role of Leslie, but I would strongly disagree. She is the perfect tomboy....note the scene in which she wears a beautiful dress to church, along with combat boots. It is her spark, her zest for life, that helps make the last half of the movie what it is.  Josh is fantastic as Jess as he slowly suspends belief in order to join Leslie in the world of Terabithia...and no young man has ever dealt with such harsh tragedy on screen better than he. Oh, and the musical score is superb.  This is truly the first flawless film of 2007.

  You are forewarned...boxes of kleenex are strongly recommended for viewing of this film if you've not seen it.  I have seen it 3 times and every time I have spent the last half hour in tears.

It's true that the trailer is a bit misleading, but the great performances and wonderful story more than make up for the lack of CGI animation that several reviewers seem to have resented.

Sort of like 'Pan's Labyrinth' for children, country kids Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) and newcomer Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) both find a land of enchantment that's only a swing on a rope away across the river.  Mending their lives and making it more meaningful, they both learn to enjoy and draw--pun intended--from their talents and friendship in their ordinary lives.

1589528,5,B00005JPL5,"I read the original book The Bridge to Terabithia when I was a kid. I don't remember very much from the book, but I remembered the general premise and the ending. When I originally read it, I really liked the book. So, obviously, when hearing that they were making it into a movie, I was very skeptical. Most good books don't translate into good movies. Then I saw the previews for the movie, and I was even more skeptical. This was not a book about fantasy lands and magical beings. This is no Chronicles of Narnia. I think it's much better, but it's certainly different.

This movie is about friendship, and imagination. It's the story of two fifth-graders, Jesse and Leslie, next-door neighbors, who are both outcasts. They aren't readily accepted in school, and aren't in love with their home lives, either. They grow a fast friendship where they ""travel"" to an imaginary land, Terabithia. In reality, it's just the woods behind their houses. All of the CGI that you see advertised is simply their imagination, and there's really very little of it. Just about every CGI-animated scene in the movie is shown in the previews. That is NOT what this movie is about, although that's what Disney would have you believe. It's about imagination and creativity, and how children should be encouraged to use that imagination.

I have a problem with all of the parents giving this movie terrible reviews because they say it's not child-appropriate. I don't have an opinion as to whether or not it's appropriate for children, that's for each individual parent to decide. Some kids can handle it, some can't. It doesn't take much research, however, to find out that this is not the happiest of stories. Any parent who really cares about what their kids see is going to research the movie BEFORE allowing their kids to see it. That involves either looking it up online, asking friends who have already seen it (or read the book), or watching it themselves FIRST to screen what their children see. I will not ruin the story by saying what happens, but if you really want to know, spend five minutes doing some research. Read the other reviews on this page, for crying out loud. But if you bring your kids to a movie that you haven't researched at all and it's not what you expect, don't blame the movie for your lack of effort. I understand Disney falsely advertised this movie, of course they did. Advertising it as another Chronicles of Narnia is certainly going to bring more sales in. But this movie is VERY GOOD. One reviewer said you have to be masochistic to enjoy a movie like this. I don't believe that's true. You simply have to appreciate a well-told story. Sometimes life sucks, and sometimes really terrible things happen. That's what the book was about, and this movie is faithful to that story.

I'm in my mid-twenties. When I went to see this, I went with a few friends of mine, all of us adults. Every one of us loved it. The two main actors (the two kids) are REALLY good. Jesse is the introvert and Leslie is the extrovert. You really buy into their friendship as you watch them learn to know one another. You want Jesse to punch the bully in the face; you want Leslie to stand up to the eighth-grader.

By the end, you could hear plenty of sniffles throughout the audience, including coming from my friends. Heck, I knew the story beforehand, and I still teared up. It's difficult to watch, but I believe the story was handled with very much care by Disney. Overall, this is an excellent movie, if not with reservations. If you're concerned with what your children see, then spend some time and find out what's in the plotline. But this movie is really good.",1175558400,105,3667,4.62826420890937

There is not as much exploration into the fantasy world as I would have liked, and the story moves along a bit slow in places.  That said, it still is a pretty good movie with a couple of life lessons thrown in.  Disney films always make some kind of point.  The moral of the story may be ""live life to the fullest, consider others even if they themselves seem inconsiderate, and don't underestimate the power of a good imagination.""

The trailers and the film poster were very misleading - very little magic in this film. The film was slow, the lovely dips into the fantasy world were infrequent and not fully explored or explained. It cost us over 50 dollars to go to this movie (with babysitter for baby, etc.) and I feel very very cheated...(I will say that the two main child actors were delightful, especially condisering the horrendous screenplay)",1174262400,11,952,4.740963855421687
1589564,4,B00005JPL5,"I know absolutely nothing about the young adult novel that this film, ""Bridge to Terabithia,"" is based on.  For this reason, I will only review this film for its contents and not on how well it translates the book to the screen.  With that said, I can claim that ""Bridge to Terabithia"" is just one more wonderful film that's been produced as of late for youngsters that's based on a book or book series.  Produced by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures, this film tells the story of Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson of ""Zathura""), a boy who lives in poverty but escapes from reality through drawing fantastical creatures and worlds.  When a new neighbor moves in who marches to the beat of a different drum, the two of them combine their imaginations to create the kingdom of Terabithia.  The neighbor is Leslie Burke, and she's played by the likeable and enthusiastic AnnaSophia Robb (""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"").  She and Jesse take their personal miseries from school and at home and turn them into trolls, evil squirrels, grenade-like pinecones and a whole slew of other creatures.  All of the bad people of Terabithia are lead by the Dark Master, a smoky, phantom-like creature.

As the story unfolds, Jesse and Leslie form a strong friendship both in reality and in fantasy.  When Jesse is asked to go to the museum by his music teacher (the excellent Zooey Deschanel), he intentionally leaves Leslie behind.  Why?  Because like any most boys in middle school he happens to have a crush on his music teacher (It's Zooey Deschanel, who wouldn't?).  When a tragedy occurs, Jesse's worlds, real and fantasy, experience dramatic changes.

""Bridge to Terabithia"" is essentially a coming-of-age tale where kids who aren't quite children but haven't yet reached adulthood come to feel the consequences of reality.  Jesse and Leslie love their fantasy world, but each day brings more reality with it.  The cast is headed up by Hutcherson, Robb, and young Bailee Madison (Jesse's cute little sister, May Belle).  The supporting cast includes Deschanel, the always reliably gruff Robert Patrick (""Terminator 2"") and Lauren Clinton.  While the adults play key roles in this film, it's really all about the kids.

The special effects are very good, though most pre-teens will pick up on their limitations.  However, the special effects take a backseat to the story, which is always refreshing to see these days.

Parents with younger children should know that the tragedy aforemetioned may be very tough for youngsters to take.  I won't go into details, but just know that it's one of the gravest tragedies that can occur in anyone's life.  There are also two instances of strong language.  The ""d"" word is used repetively in both of them.  One occurs in the back of a truck after church and the other happens in the greenhouse at Jesse's home when he loses his father's keys.  Other than that, there isn't anything in the film that you really need to look out for.

As a fantasy tale, ""Terabithia"" works well.  It works better as a film about a young boy and his friend who come to terms with reality.  I highly recommend this film for families, just be prepared to do some heavy explaining with younger children (under eight) when reality really, really hits home.  Fans of this movie may also enjoy ""The Chronicles of Narnia:  The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,"" the ""Harry Potter"" films (although as Harry gets older, the movies and books become geared more towards older children), and ""The Neverending Story.""  Also, even though I haven't read this particular book, I have read plenty of other young adult books in my day.  Pick up ""A Wrinkle In Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle, any of the ""Harry Potter"" books, or any other wonderful child and pre-teen fantasy for your children to read if they enjoy this film.

Highly recommended.",1174262400,86,3865,4.869831546707504
1589565,5,B00005JPL5,"I experienced (not ""saw"") this movie today with my adult daughter, on a dinner and movie afternoon to ""catch up"" on things; we both share a delight in fantasy that is is interpretive and reflective. Unlike virtually all of the reviewers I've read here, I had no knowledge that a book even existed, let alone was a beloved classic. I saw the movie based on a few intriguing trailers, and never read a review of the movie. We both came to the theatre without expectations based on reviews or the preconception that this was a canon to some, not to be trifled with. It is clear from the reviews here that many viewers were clearly hoping to share something with their children that they had experienced as a child reading the book. Clearly, most of these reviews of the movie judge this movie on it's fidelity in mood, plot, and character to what they individually brought with them from the book they read as a child....and that's OK (for them). I will not discuss the plot, but I cannot understand how someone who read and loved the book would not be aware of the plot and it's central turning point and judge their children's reactions accordingly. I saw no sobbing children...perhaps they were more thoughtful than if it had been ""Shrek"", but as a parent, I would have felt that this film spoke honestly to children about how difficult it is for them to understand their children's world, and how equally tough it is for children to understand the grown up world. I would have expected questions and been prepared with some answers. ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" resonated with me as a much kinder, gentler, and above all honest treatment of the bridge we cross when we move from childhood to adolescence, with it's loss of innocence and come face to face with the world in which we live.

Setting aside THE BOOK, I found the MOVIE to be one of the best I've seen this year in it's ability to tap into my feelings about my early years, both as a child and a parent, and I was absorbed from beginning to end by the wonderful, fanciful, magical special effects, as well as the development of the parents from being seen from the children's point of view to a sense of them and their difficulties I understand as an adult. OK, I loved this movie, and I will return with my wife to experience the joy and sadness and wonder of this enchanting film. I loved these characters and I loved the film, and I see many, many films. The innocence and lack of cynicism reminded me of a collaboration of Norman Rockwell and  Steven Spielberg. If you have no young children, see this movie anyway.

1589568,3,B00005JPL5,"This tragic coming of age story touching upon the importance of friendship and the power of human imagination fell victim to an average screenplay that failed to develop the story to its full potential.

There are two overlapping worlds in this story in terms of the main characters: that of reality and that of imagination.  The film's detailed development of the real life and conflicts of the main characters left much unexplored in their parallel world of imagination.  For this reason, the film fails to make the immediate connection of the childrens' imaginary world to their frustrations in the real world.  As a result, those parts of the film come across as undeveloped and without any immediate connection to the characters' woes in the real world.  The film therefore appeared slow with nonsequential scenes and subplots.

The book is a better medium to convey the themes of this story than this film.  The film's plot and subplots were not developed or connected well enough to keep my attention.  Despite being a children's story, this story is primarily a tragedy on mortality, innocence, and imagination and is not really suited for children who are not old enough to comprehend death as a subject.",1173744000,11,1213,4.97029702970297

1589651,4,B00005JPL5,"Bridge to Terabithia is a film that captures the imagination. But behind the imagination, it is a film about being a kid and developing friendships as well as conflicting experiences that children also have to deal with.  And with most Disney films, there is a moral behind the story that is accentuated with the main character Jess Anderson (Josh Hutcherson).

Jess is a boy who lives with three sisters and loves to draw.  Throughout the film he draws in his sketchbook, but his father does no understand him.  His world somewhat lightens up during the first day of class when a new girl shows up, Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb), who also happens to live next door to his house, and helps him to see that he is talented.  And straight to the chase, the two become friends and spend time together sharing anecdotes about each of their lives.  One day they venture out into a wooded area where they create a world of their own; they are free to be anything they want, and the world is indeed their oyster.

Bridge to Terabithia also confronts childhood dilemmas. Who has not been taunted by a bully, a person who tries to dominate one's world?  Janice (Lauren Clinton), an eighth-grader, is the school bully who refuses entry to all who need to use the girl's room, and the only way to pass is to pay her a dollar.  Jess's sister, May Belle (Bailee Anderson), is constantly bullied by Janice in a very childish manner, taking Bailee's twinkie or refusing her entry to the restroom.  But it is surprising to see how the tables are turned on her, and how she is portrayed in Jess and Leslie's forest of imagination.  In addition, the concluding scenes in the film takes on a serious issue that slightly changes the mood of the film.

Bridge to Terabithia emphasizes kindness and unselfishness toward others.  And for those who remember playing in a tree-house or playing in the woods and enrapturing one's self in a world of pure imagination, this film will definitely conjure up childhood memories.",1173484800,2,1991,4.686781609195402
1589652,3,B00005JPL5,"As a movie about the lost powers of the imagination, ""Terabithia"" is a mixed blessing.  Kids today have a lot of digital and electronic crutches on which to prop up their creative spirit; it's nice for a story to encourage the limitless scope of the human mind.  Fifteen year old Jesse Aarons, an aspiring artist, has a home life that offers little in the way of dream nourishment, so it is no surprise when he quickly befriends the New Girl In School, Leslie Burke, a young naif with a spirit as wholesome and wide-eyed as her cute little face.

Jesse and Leslie soon discover their own little paradise in the woods behind their house.  They call this land Terabithia and dress it up with their ""wide open"" minds.  Disney helps the jaded viewer out by giving us sometimes rich, sometimes ambivalent CGI depictions of their pretend world, but they are rare.  This is just as well; the movie wants us to rediscover the wonder of our own minds, but it leaves very little of the story up to our own imaginations.

I have to wonder if the emotion of the film (and it wants to have so much emotion) wouldn't have more impact if there was more humanity to back it up.  It shows us a world of heartless bullies (some misunderstood and hurting; some just plain malicious), pesky but endearing little sisters, and happy vs. struggling homes, and then balances this out with brief moments of care-free, play-land giddiness.  It can't have both, at least not in equal measure.  It sacrifices some of its heart and soul for the kindling flash of its fantasy world, and vice versa.

By the time Jesse's absurdly hot music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, offers (out of the blue!) to take him (alone!) to a museum, it's hard to figure out just what is real and what isn't (this movie's world must exist before things like permission slips were invented).  At any rate, this becomes the marker for the movie's last bit of credibility, where Jesse and Leslie's world runs headlong into harsh reality.  What follows are a series of events that pretend to be saturated with import, but which are instead progressively longer and more maudlin.  By the time all was said and done, this reviewer felt cheated.  The flick pretended to be magical, but I could see the rabbits hiding in its hat.",1173052800,2,2261,4.6175

1589654,4,B00005JPL5,"Terebithia was a magical land which took shape after Leslie Burke moved to yet another school where she didn't fit in. Prettier than the popular cheerleaders, but too different to be accepted, she'd had to live in a fantasy world all ehr own as no one had ever had the time to listen. She was harassed by the nasty girls who would turn into people like the agitator at the last movie. She observed that her neighbor was treated badly by the bullies on the playground and on their school bus. She sat beside him so they'd leave him alone.

There's nothing like first love as they transformed an old tree house out in the woods into a magical kingdom of which Leslie was the leader. Both ran like Forrest Gump as they departed the real world of violence on the school bus. The bridge was a hanging rope which they used a la Tarzan on his jungle vines. I wondered how the dog PT got across the flooded creek.

As time went by, they became good friends but one day he took a field trip to a museum in the city without letting Leslie know. It was an unexpected treat, an opportunity he could not turn down. Though they were now close emotionally, he kept the trip secret like males tend to do, and he wasn't there when fate played its dirty trick.

The founder of Terebithia went alone to their playground but the ""bridge"" broke. Jess felt guilty because he'd been too selfish to invite her along. Had fate been different, he would have taken her to the museum to show off his knowledge and experience. The oen time he wasn't there at a critical moment, she slipped and drown; when Zach took us to see the circus in Huntsville, Alabama, a friend of mine slipped away into oblivion and her mean daughter pulled the plug. Jess went into denial and missed her constantly. She'd been his sunshine and inspiration, and he just could not ""let go.""

When an unexpected death hits us, it helps to remembe the good about the person who now is gone. My tribute to Bob Lobertine prompted by a callous state trooper's critical remark -- a letter to the Nashville Tennessean saying we should remember the good about a prominent person and let the bad die with him. Hold on to your loved one's specialness to keep it alive. The music throughout was delightful, shades of Star Wars (soundtrack is out and is fantastic).",1172620800,,2299,4.453681710213777
1589655,4,B00005JPL5,"The story starts in a dismally familiar way - a family with not enough to go around, a school full of bullies, and unique interests that set Jess apart from all the other kids. Then Leslie arrives. The new kid is an outcast too, so Jess and Leslie end up being outcasts together. Leslie has many skills, but one that seems truly magical. She has an overflowing imagination, the kind that envelops everyone around her if they let it. Jess lets himself become part of it, and is suddenly king of a realm filled with giants, winged warriors, and other impossible beings.

It's a Disney movie, so it's put together well and it's filled with cute kids and identifiable stereotypes. Special effects are just that - special, used with a light hand until the final scene. The story is easy for kids to understand, but the plot includes a troubling major event from which it never quite seemed to recover. If your little one is at all skittish, you might want to read the book so she's properly prepared for that part of the movie.

Only one element of the story looked out of place, where a teacher takes Jess on a Saturday ""field trip"" alone, and with sketchy parental knowledge. The book is over twenty years old now. Maybe, back then, that could seem as safe and encouraging as it was meant to look. We no longer live in that naive world. Although it was in fact quite innocent, it has a dark, creepy appearance to modern eyes. Any parent of young kids will want to have a long talk about that after the movie, or maybe before, or maybe both.

Still, it's an enjoyable flick. The child actors are engaging, and the balance of fantasy with gritty reality comes off well. And, whatever you may think of that tragic defining moment, such things really do happen, and kids have to deal with them. If a kid in your life faces a shock of that kind, there might be value in knowing that other kids faces shocks too, and make it through them.

1589656,4,B00005JPL5,"When you read a book by someone who has a wild imagination, you can only imagine what the person did when he/she was a kid. I am a writer. People tell me I have a great imagination. I don't know if that's true. What I do know is that I grew up in the time period where video games were just starting to go from 2D to 3D, and the internet was being born. While I dabbled in outdoor imagination once in awhile, by the age of seven I was hooked up to electronics and using my imagination to pretend I was on a pirate ship just didn't have much of an effect on me anymore. Besides, pirates stopped being cool until ""Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" come out to theaters, and made me want to be a pirate again at the ripe age of sixteen, and by that time I found out that boat manufactures stopped making pirate ships due to a lack of interest in them.

Since I can not be the only person who has gone through this, and since there are so many other things a kid can plug into these days, I have to wonder whether there would be anyone who could relate to ""Bridge To Terabithia,"" a movie where two kids dodge bullies at school and escape to the imaginary world of Terabithia after school. I feel today's kids have so much more material things to keep them distracted in life then to be bothered with creating magical fantasy worlds in the local creek. I think the film makers realized this was a tricky situation that they couldn't fake, so they made it so our two leads have perfectly logical reasons to not spend all day playing with toys. Our young friend Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) comes from a poor family. They are so poor they can't afford a second hand Game Boy, and he inherits a pair of pink sneakers that belongs to one of his older sisters (he is the middle child between two older sisters and one younger sister).

Now his new friend Leslie Burke (Anna Sophia Robb), the girl at school, comes from a rich family. Her parents are both writers, but they do not own a TV because they feel it rots creativeness. I would like to have a word with these parents myself, but for the sake of the movie I'll let them off the hook. Since these two kids have nothing to plug into, and are constantly bullied at school and are unappreciated at home, they must find other means to entertain themselves. They find this entertainment by going deep into the local creek no one visits (probably because the other kids at schools DO have TV's and computer games to play), and create an imaginary world that they call Terabithia. They build a fort, play games, and in one scene even fight trolls and flying monsters. A good majority of the movie takes place at home and in school though, where they have very real problems to deal with.

Jesse has great talent to be an artist, but receives little support from his family. His stressed out father in particular doesn't support his love for art, saying ""if [drawing is] so beneficial why don't you draw me some money?"" He receives encouragement to continue his drawing from Ms. Edmonds, the music teacher he develops a crush on. Leslie's problems at home are minor, but we find out that she has never had any friends on account that people are intimidated by her imaginative personality. Both kids are bullied by kids, though Leslie deals with the bullying better then Jessie does (a girl who tries to charge a dollar to use the bathroom inspires Leslie to start a ""Free The Pee"" march). In Terabithia though, these kids are King and Queen, protecting their kingdom and escaping their problems. A twist near the end changes their lives though.

I will not share this twist with you, but it elevates the movie from ""heartwarming kids tale"" to a full blown tragedy. For those who have read the book I'm sure you know what to expect. I did not, and therefor the twist came as a punch in the stomach to me. It left me so devastated I cried twice. Once in the theater and once when I got home. I'm not going to comment much on the advertising campaign, other then to say that I think it's a shame Disney feels like they need to pretend this is a children's ""Lord of the Rings"" in order to sell tickets. This is a great movie, period. The smoke and mirrors are not needed to sell this to kids. Kids love movies based on whether they are good or not, and promising them something they are not going to get doesn't help your bottom line in the long run.

And this movie is full of things kids love.  Adventures, jokes, underdogs that come out on top.  Heck, it even has a regular dog in the movie.  I don't care who you are, but having a dog included in a movie automatically makes me add half a star to a movie based on that fact alone.  For adults it will bring back a childhood innocense they thought they had lost.  For me it was a revolution of the heart.  Aside from the fact that I was expecting a completely different movie then what I got, it brought back memories of when you felt the world was against you, and it was only you and your best friend who could take care of each other.  Still, the movie geek in me has to admit that the biggest revelation from this movie comes from the fact that it was directed by Gabor Csupo, who is most famous as the creator of ""The Rugrats.""

It's such a big shock to find that out, that I wonder if the feeling people had when they discovered Frank Sinatra was a pretty good actor was similar to this. Csupo creates a wonderful movie here for people of any age. I think parents with kids under the age of ten might want to preview the movie first, because the movie really does become depressing, but otherwise this is a great movie. I hesitate before saying this, because it's only February, but...oh, what the heck I'll say it anyway. ""Bridge To Terabithia"" is one of the best films of the year.

Rating: **** and a half stars",1172620800,11,5828,4.329972502291476
1589657,1,B00005JPL5,"This would be a great film to show in a college level grief counseling class or a course dealing with Post Traumatic Stress disorders. Nor am I being sarcastic. Bridge to Terabithia is truly a legitimate film to study in a college psychology course dealing with these issues.  It shows the adults  in the story trying their best to help the surviving child cope with an all too common tragedy -  death by drowning of a friend.

However, this film is overwhelming with grief.  I have enough in my own personal life, as many of us do, that I don't need to pay to watch it on the big screen, too.  I'm not asking for only mindless entertainment. But when out-of-the-blue, in the middle of the story, in what started off as a delightful fantasy - turns into a gloomy melodrama - then I have a problem reconciling my need for entertainment with the filmmaker's need to demoralize his or her audience!

I also want to make it clear this movie is not appropriate for young children, unless you want to expose them to the tragedy of sudden death, and all its raw emotions.

Its extremely rare that a film leaves me in such a sour mood. Perhaps it's because, as a young teen, a classmate of mine drowned since he did not know how to swim. A stupid way to die - to put it mildly. So if any lesson can be taken from this movie it is this:  Make sure you teach your children how to swim - along with making them understand & respect the power of water!",1172534400,20,1440,4.284132841328414
1589658,5,B00005JPL5,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It was so good that I saw it twice and may see it one more time before waiting to buy it on dvd.  Everyone should go see this movie.

Bridge to Terabithia is a very touching and emotional story.  Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb do a wonderful job of playing Jesse & Leslie.  AnnaSophia is not only a great little actress but also sings beautifully.  She should get an award for best actress of her portrayal as Leslie Burke.  The song ""Keep Your Mind Wide Open"" sung by AnnaSophia is very fitting and very beautiful though only heard for a short segment in the film.  AnnaSophia brightens the screen each time she appears as Leslie.  She is the bright spot in Jesse's life and helps him face his problems.  Jesse in turn helps Leslie face her problems.  They are the best of friends.  This is a movie about how people deal with everyday problems.  You can either let the problem crush you or deal with it.

The other actors play there roles wonderfully including Bailee Madison as Jesse's sister, May Belle.  Robert Patrick does a great job as Jesse's father.  Jesse's music teacher played by Zooey Deschanel does an outstanding job.  Each actor does their part so well that it would be hard to imagine the parts played by anyone else.  Everyone who worked on this movie should be praised for a job well done.  David Paterson, the son of Katherine Paterson - the author of the book, should be applauded for his persistence in getting this film made.  It took many years for this movie to be realized and it was well worth it.

The movie is basically the same story as the book with a few minor changes and additional fantasy scenes which enhance the movie.  I suggest you read the book as well as seeing the movie.  Bridge to Terabithia has been updated to the current time period from the 1970's in the book, but even this does not distract from this timeless tale.

If this movie does not touch your heart, then you are probably dead.",1172534400,4,2000,4.431318681318682
1589659,5,B00005JPL5,"Sometimes a movie shows up like this one & it just hits me... hard... although I never expected it to...never mind having it possibly be the BEST film of 2007!
That brings me to this FANTASTIC family film that way surpasses anything in depth, emotion, & real-life types of stuff with a mix of fantasy & imagination than I have seen in years... I highly recommend seeing ""BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA""... The cast is sensational & the movie is brilliant! It's the first time I had seen this type of subject matter handled in such a realistic way for a young cast & even though the fantasy element is what drew me to see the movie, the movie ended up being so much more than that & I can't praise it enough for how refreshing, charming, & what an emotional experience it was.
So ya, I loved it...
""KEEP YOUR MIND WIDE OPEN...""
One of the major reasons why I loved the film so much was for starlet AnnaSophia Robb, who played ""Leslie"" in the film... a quirky, fashion savy student writer, & basically summed up why we need more artistic, creative, imaginative, free-spirited people in this world, who are able to take you away from the day-to-day, and invigorate your passion & mind. I know everyone who I went to see the film with adored her & she took us on an emotional rollercoaster ride. She was basically the girl-next-door us artsy-types wish we had growing up next to us when we were in our youths...

So go see the film (or buy the DVD upon it's release) & find out exactly what I'm talking about, it's definately a bonified classic in my opinion... ^_-",1172448000,4,1551,4.442105263157894
1589660,5,B00005JPL5,"I read the book when I was in the 7th grade, which was a looooong time ago. I was so inspired by Leslie that  I vowed  I would never keep a television in my home if I had children. I was really excited that ""Bridge to Terabithia""  would be in theaters, but I must admit that the previews for the movie were misleading and had me afraid that  the movie would not be like the  book and would have too many special effects. Actually, the movie stays very close to the book and the special effects were minimal, which is good. Having too many special effects would defeat the message of the movie: use your imagination. ""Bridge to Terabithia"" was deep and it focused on friendship, relationships with family and peers, death, bereavement, and  keeping an open mind. I cried towards the end and I'm sure I wasn't the only one. This movie was great and I'm really surprised by some of the negative reviews I see on here. Just because something  is supposed to be a ""kids movie"" doesn't mean you take your 3-6 year old to see it. This movie touched on issues that young people experience and it doesn't make it a bad movie. Five stars for an awesome movie based on an awesome book!",1172448000,5,1174,4.3577981651376145

However, when finding out it was a completely different story than that, I , unlike these reviewers, was FAR from being disappointed.  After the movie was over, I thought to myself, ""Wow, this world needs more people, especially young ones, who are like the character Leslie Burke, (brilliantly portrayed by the extremely talented Annasophia Robb). Also, after viewing this brilliant film, I was thinking how this character, Leslie Burke, was a mere 10 yrs old and, sadly to say, was far more mature than even the forty-somethings on these pathetic TV shows like ""Sex And The City"".  It's amazing to see how much us adults can really learn from such children as Leslie.  And yes, the story is tragic, but that is the whole point.  You leave the film thinking about how precious life really is and how NEVER should we take our family or friends for granted and these themes are so beautifully brought out in the film that they do not sound at all cliched.  Please, give this film a try and really think about how marvelous a gift that Leslie Burke is to the people around her--and to this world.",1172016000,10,1182,4.604761904761904

1589714,4,B00005JPL5,"This movie is not advertised nicely, lol. How nasty of Disney to trick people with previews that make this movie look like something it is not. It is a good movie. Gunwrenching at times... and very sad. Not one I would take a young kid to. My sister who is 12 cried... I cried, and it was a good few hours before I settled down enough to think about whether I really liked the film or not.

The acting is great. There has rarely been a film that touched me the way this one did. It hurt when Jess asked his father if his friend was going to go to hell and that he felt it was his fault. I thought the cast was awesome. You really get attached to Jess and Leslie as best friends, so it's very tough when they are separated.

The advertising is what I think will hurt this flick.  If you are like me, you never heard of this book until now. So when you walked into the movie you had just a vague incorrect idea of what to expect. That's what will hurt this movie. People being upset because they wanted something and were served something completely different. I was mad for a few days about the commercials myself... becuase yeah... the movie was really emotional.

This is not a feel-good movie, but it is a really good one.  My son said he enjoyed it because he was able to relate to how Jesse felt - the actors do a wonderful job of making the characters real.  If you're looking for a light and fun movie, take your kids to see Night at the Museum.

1589717,5,B00005JPL5,"I read the original book The Bridge to Terabithia when I was a kid. I don't remember very much from the book, but I remembered the general premise and the ending. When I originally read it, I really liked the book. So, obviously, when hearing that they were making it into a movie, I was very skeptical. Most good books don't translate into good movies. Then I saw the previews for the movie, and I was even more skeptical. This was not a book about fantasy lands and magical beings. This is no Chronicles of Narnia. I think it's much better, but it's certainly different.

This movie is about friendship, and imagination. It's the story of two fifth-graders, Jesse and Leslie, next-door neighbors, who are both outcasts. They aren't readily accepted in school, and aren't in love with their home lives, either. They grow a fast friendship where they ""travel"" to an imaginary land, Terabithia. In reality, it's just the woods behind their houses. All of the CGI that you see advertised is simply their imagination, and there's really very little of it. Just about every CGI-animated scene in the movie is shown in the previews. That is NOT what this movie is about, although that's what Disney would have you believe. It's about imagination and creativity, and how children should be encouraged to use that imagination.

I have a problem with all of the parents giving this movie terrible reviews because they say it's not child-appropriate. I don't have an opinion as to whether or not it's appropriate for children, that's for each individual parent to decide. Some kids can handle it, some can't. It doesn't take much research, however, to find out that this is not the happiest of stories. Any parent who really cares about what their kids see is going to research the movie BEFORE allowing their kids to see it. That involves either looking it up online, asking friends who have already seen it (or read the book), or watching it themselves FIRST to screen what their children see. I will not ruin the story by saying what happens, but if you really want to know, spend five minutes doing some research. Read the other reviews on this page, for crying out loud. But if you bring your kids to a movie that you haven't researched at all and it's not what you expect, don't blame the movie for your lack of effort. I understand Disney falsely advertised this movie, of course they did. Advertising it as another Chronicles of Narnia is certainly going to bring more sales in. But this movie is VERY GOOD. One reviewer said you have to be masochistic to enjoy a movie like this. I don't believe that's true. You simply have to appreciate a well-told story. Sometimes life sucks, and sometimes really terrible things happen. That's what the book was about, and this movie is faithful to that story.

I'm in my mid-twenties. When I went to see this, I went with a few friends of mine, all of us adults. Every one of us loved it. The two main actors (the two kids) are REALLY good. Jesse is the introvert and Leslie is the extrovert. You really buy into their friendship as you watch them learn to know one another. You want Jesse to punch the bully in the face; you want Leslie to stand up to the eighth-grader.

By the end, you could hear plenty of sniffles throughout the audience, including coming from my friends. Heck, I knew the story beforehand, and I still teared up. It's difficult to watch, but I believe the story was handled with very much care by Disney. Overall, this is an excellent movie, if not with reservations. If you're concerned with what your children see, then spend some time and find out what's in the plotline. But this movie is really good.",1171843200,10,3667,4.62826420890937
