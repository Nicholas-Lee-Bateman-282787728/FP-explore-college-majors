5361974,2,B009S0VGUG,"First off, I am a Tony Roberts fan. I've been following him since his  Def Comedy Jam days (and have even forgiven him for ""Mr. Box Office""). I picked up his last DVD ""Wired"" and laughed...hard. So I was more than ready to give his latest release a try. It runs about an hour. I mention this because he loses steam after about 20 minutes. Roberts has always been a very physical comedian, always putting so much energy into his acts (knocking over mic stands, smacking stools with towels, etc.). But here he begins to show wear at about the 20 minute mark and thus the rest of the performance lacks any real kick after this as a result. Immediate problem: His performance was not paced (as which happens with so many acts). His game went from ""A"" for the first 15 minutes to ""C-"" at best as he wraps up. But this release did do something for me: It pushed me to dust off some old Def Comedy Jam DVDs.",1359763200,9,900,4.2631578947368425

5362035,1,B009S0VGUG,Tony Roberts had a very rough time getting started in this special. Dedicating the show to Eddie Murphy and then leaving the stage to change 10 minutes into the show. Seemed to lack focus and relied heavily on cultural differences in order to get laughs. Heavy use of cuss words and lack of shared experience made this show seem boring and lack material. Did not make it past the 20 minute mark.,1461715200,,395,4.5

5362091,5,B009S0VGUG,"4.5 stars

While his material might not always be top notch all the way, Roberts' delivery is so far above and beyond any of his contemporaries that I can't help but rank him with the best comedians working today for sheer entertainment value.

I'm Different is from an August 2011 show in Sacramento, and the audience is good but hardly as raucous and supportive as his hometown of Detroit or the audience on Wired, his last dvd. While the first 20 minutes of that show are the best thing he's yet recorded, it slips after that, whereas ID simmers well throughout and never really lulls too hard.

I am almost unoffendable, unlike some of the crowd here, who wince when he goes places that most comics dare not. But you can tell Tony is truly good-natured, and none of this is mean-spirited, even when it crosses oh so many lines. And when it's delivered with such over the top mastery of his four props -- stool, chair, mic stand and towel, used more imaginatively and continuously than anybody else ever dreamed of -- and his hilariously hyper ADHD movement, even merely fair material comes alive.

No comic working today delivers jokes with this much zing and zest and crazy velocity. The man is a powerhouse. He also pops and locks like a pro at points here, and is clearly just waiting for the right vehicle to turn him into a big screen superstar. He comes out with a brief tribute to his hero Eddie Murphy, but frankly I think Tony is funnier than Eddie when he really hits it here. This guy is poised to be the next big thang...but I said that about Doug Stanhope in 2002, and his unwillingness to be anything other than crudely accurate about society is still keeping him in cult-hero status, and perhaps Tony will see the same fate. (As might Corey Holcomb, another legendary guy currently working the circuit, who is TR's polar opposite in delivery but a true brother in edgy material. How I'd love to see those two on a double bill!)

But being a successful working comedian is a good thing, no doubt, and Roberts would have to tone down his all too pointed observations about many topics to ever get on even HBO. And why bother? Here's hoping society comes to Tony rather than vice versa, as anybody with this much insane energy and unique talent should never compromise his real self.

Tony IS different, and blessedly so. He makes every other comic seem positively moribund, and when he's hitting it makes me laugh as hard as anybody working today. He's one of a kind, his best days stretch out ahead, and it's a pleasure watching him develop. Rock on, and keep being different. We've already got plenty sameness already.",1381795200,4,2637,4.588110403397027
