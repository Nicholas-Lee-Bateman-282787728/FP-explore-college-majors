My sister and I watched it a zillion times thru childhood, and I'd venture to guess both of us in our 30's STILL know it word for word even now. I wish I could share it with my kids but no longer have or know anyone with a working VCR. :(
Great memories of all these characters. ~ tiffanyboone77",1363651200,,334,4.0

""Follow the path of righteousness!"" is something our extended family heard for years!  Great movie.",1355270400,,265,4.844444444444444

8167526,5,B000MAM7FE,I use to have this video when my children were young.  Good  lessons for learning about life.  I'm looking for it for my first grandchild.  I know he'll enjoy it as well and learn lessons that will take him through life.,1237593600,,220,4.2926829268292686
