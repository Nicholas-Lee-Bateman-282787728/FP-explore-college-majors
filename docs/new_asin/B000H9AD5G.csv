2632342,3,B000H9AD5G,"Both films were of very good quality.  However, several times the movie would pause for about a second and then jump to the next scene.  I will not return the movies but I was disappointed in this technical glitch.",1370563200,,214,4.461538461538462
2632343,5,B000H9AD5G,Nobody can be John Wayne and american icon whose movies still hold their own with todays movies. He is an american treasure.,1369785600,,124,4.681818181818182
2632344,5,B000H9AD5G,"""The Undefeated"" - great watching for John Wayne and Rock Hudson fans. Set during the immediate post-Civil War, Rock and his ex-Rebel soldiers find themselves on a parallel trail to Mexico with John Wayne and his ex-Union troopers.  Fast paced and funny, you'll recognize a lot of familiar faces from John Wayne 1960s westerns plus a few faces from the NFL - Merlyn Olsen and (be still my beating heart) Roman Gabriel. Woof!  Our VHS tape's worn out - let's see how long the DCD lasts...

As for ""North to Alaska"" - another romp in 1900 Alaska's Gold Rush - both heroes [John Wayne, Stewart Granger] and (wink-wink) villain Ernie Kovacs dominate the screen.  The lovely and ever-classy Capucine (Pink Panther) continues to show her comedic talents as well. Who could look at anyone else when she's on the screen? Really. The late Johnny Horton's rendition of the title song will stick with you for days if you let it. I did. The only drag to the entire movie was Fabian's singing and almost-acting in scenes with Capucine. They were painful to watch.
A lot of Wayne's movies from the 1960s & 1970s featured a teen idol/young name actor attraction for the box office. Most of them worked fine!  Case in point - El Dorado [James Caan], Rio Bravo [Rick Nelson AND Dean Martin], Rio Lobo [Chris Mitchum, Robert Mitchum's son], Big Jake [Chris Mitchum, again and Bobby Vinton], True Grit [Glen Campbell] and The Alamo [Frankie Avalon].  This one didn't fare so well.  Luckily, you can fast-forward through those few minutes and still enjoy everything else going on ...",1367712000,2,1563,4.766666666666667
2632345,5,B000H9AD5G,"If you are a John Wayne Fan, which I am a big fan, you need to get these two movies. ""The Undefeated and North to Alaska"". I had The Undefeated on VHS but wanted it on DVD.
