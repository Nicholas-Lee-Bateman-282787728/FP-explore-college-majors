8711238,2,B00VU0TEMO,"I have 4 of the Heidi Songs sight word DVDs and love them. I use them daily in my kindergarten classroom. I purchased this DVD for our unit on shapes and am extremely disappointed. The circle song points to the moon, sun, and a ball, which are all SPHERES, not circles. This is a common misconception with young children attempting to differentiate between 2D and 3D shapes and I was not pleased that this DVD reinforces this misunderstanding rather than helping to correct it.",1510099200,2,477,4.690476190476191
