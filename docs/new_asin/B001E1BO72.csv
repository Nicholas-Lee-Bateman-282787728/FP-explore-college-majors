8296025,5,B001E1BO72,"Most War File Documentaries are good.  All those featuring Bob Carruthers are excellent!  The fall of france is no exception. This is a complete and detailed account of the event, without the usual tired WWII footage.  This is well edited and Carruthers makes all the information revelent and interesting.  And yes, the emphasis is on tanks!  Great Video!",1382400000,4,355,5.051724137931035
