8603770,5,B00ECE61SA,"Oneiric is a great short film representing a young filmmaker's unique perspective on racial discrimination as seen through the innocent and virtuous eyes of children. The film sends a strong message by depicting the simplicity and purity of a world without limitations and discrimination based on skin color, national origin or race, a world of equality and fairness. The film teaches a lesson many of us need to pay close attention. Martin Luther King started the civil rights movement 50 years ago and yet we are still a society very much at war with our differences. Watch the movie, it is worth every second of it! This film and its complimentary Study Guide can be used in Social Studies curriculum throughout the country to teach equality and instill values our youngest generations will need to carry through life to make this world a better place.",1378512000,,855,4.903448275862069

8603772,5,B00ECE61SA,"It's been 50 years since Martin Luther King delivered his iconic `I Have A Dream' speech and as a society we have come a long way since those times.  But we still have a long, long way to go and ""Oneiric"" is a fervent reminder of that.  This short film deals with racism and discrimination still so prevalent in our society and raises some difficult questions that every person, young and old, should answer for themselves.  This film would also be a great teaching tool for 4th grade through middle school students.  Aside from its powerful message, the skillful use of symbolism, theme, and story development would provide further class discussion, as would the comprehensive & thorough accompanying study guide.  Beautiful message, beautiful cinematography, beautiful film!",1377648000,,776,5.126984126984127
8603773,5,B00ECE61SA,"Beautiful short film with highly effective and productive companion study guide.  There cannot ever be enough messages depicting how innocence....a pure heart....is all that's necessary to end hate based conflict.  How better to show this than with fresh young minds open to love, and unexposed to barriers.  The kids in this film did a great job.  It's a really sweet story, with a message that will resonate with all age groups.  Length is perfect to view and then discuss in one class period, and as a basis for a short homework/writing assignment on tolerance.",1376784000,,564,4.957446808510638
