7613725,4,B01AVSFWF8,"It's a championship that has some of the most well known names attached to its history including current & future members of the Hall Of Fame, a championship that has had its share of controversy throughout it's history, and a championship that has been around in some form through different eras & companies for close to 40 years all based on the representation of a country in the United States Championship.  This is the fourth attempt by WWE (WWE, World Heavyweight, Intercontinental) to chronicle the history of a championship through matches & commentary from each promotion the championship was active (NWA Mid-Atlantic/Jim Crockett Promotions, WCW, WWE) hosted by John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield.

Matches Include:
Special Guest Referee - Andre The Giant: Ric Flair vs. Ricky Steamboat - Flair was stalling early on before Steamboat was able to eventually get offense in using his own speed & Flair's own momentum against him while Flair continued to use whatever tactics he could to slow the pace down & ground Steamboat in a solid encounter (when did they ever have a bad one?) with Andre contributing to the match getting physically involved whenever either man attempted to stretch the rules.
""NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" September '78

Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper - You knew the direction this was going right from the start as both men had such an aggressive lockup right from the start with either man refusing to give an inch to the point where there was an accidental disqualification only for the winner to refuse it because they wanted to settle the score as they traded momentum with both men giving some very intense blows against each other from taking a shot behind the referee to rubbing their face into the mat in what was more of a preview of what was to come in their future encounters (ala Dog Collar Match at Starrcade) in what was a physical encounter.
""NWA World Wide Wrestling"" Mar. '83

Steel Cage/""I Quit"" Match: Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A. - Both men started brawling with each other right away trading fist with both men sending the other into the cage multiple times causing them to bleed only for each other to continue to relentlessly focus on the cut either ripping or biting at it as both men continued to use whatever they could get their hands on to punish each other including the microphone or a wooden chair to the point where anyone else who got in their way would pay for it as this match has gone down as one of the greatest ""I Quit"" matches of all time to the point where it's the standard of what's expected from this type of match as it was exactly what you expected...a violent, physical, bloody war.
NWA Starrcade '85
[Bloodbath: Wrestling's Most Dangerous Steel Cage Matches; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]

""Best Of Seven"" Series Finals Match: Magnum T.A. vs. Nikita Koloff - Magnum took the fight to his opponent right away heavily working over an area of the body to the point where he refused to let it go when they went out of the ring to the outside & used the environment around him to his advantage while Nikita relied on taking shortcuts & advantage of any distractions along with using his power to focus on an area of the body himself in what was an aggressive match between two bitter rivals.
""NWA World Wide Wrestling"" Aug. '86

Steel Cage Match: Lex Luger vs. Dusty Rhodes - This had the stipulation that Dusty was going to be suspended for 90 days if he lost and they had Johnny Weaver at ringside as the gatekeeper. Dusty worked a different offense than usual as he kept going to sleeperholds throughout the match including the ""Weaver-lock"" that Johnny Weaver made famous while grinding on Luger's arm to take away the Torture Rack. Luger also worked over Dusty's arm & used his power along with the used the cage to bust Dusty open with an ending that would not only only be defined by the word ""karma"" but but also have a huge ripple effect for everyone involved.
NWA Starrcade '87
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

No Disqualification Match: Dusty Rhodes vs. Bobby Eaton - This was a ""Champion vs. Champion"" match as Eaton was also one half of the United States Tag Team Champions while Jim Cornette was in his corner.  You saw both men take advantage of the stipulation early on using tactics either on the floor or use of a weapon as Eaton attempted to focus on an area of the body along with his trademark aerial offense while Cornette on the outside kept making his presence known as Dusty continued to fight off both men in various ways including submission & coming off the top rope himself fighting fire with fire in a fun match.
""NWA Power Pro Wrestling"" Feb. '88

Barry Windham vs. Junk Yard Dog - JYD showcased his strength early on overpowering Windham from his strength to hard headbutts with Windham's offense having no effect on him causing him to resort to illegal tactics to slow the pace down in a short match that never really left first gear but good for what it was.
""NWA Main Event"" Jan. '89

Lex Luger vs. Sting - Luger's focus was on the crowd more than anything allowing Sting to take advantage with a fast paced start focusing on a specific part of the body before Luger was able to recover resorting to taking shortcuts such as taking advantage of the ringside environment & his superior strength in a solid encounter.
""NWA World Championship Wrestling"" Dec. '89

Sting vs. Rick Rude - Rick Rude came to WCW a month earlier at Halloween Havoc alongside Paul E. Dangerously & Madusa declaring his intentions of gaining the United States Championship while also during this time, Sting was receiving various gifts while also having a bounty put on out him from a mystery person who was revealed earlier in the night to be Lex Luger who attacked Sting's previously injured leg to the point where he was in the hospital only to return for this match with his leg wrapped up. Sting was fighting on adrenaline as they fought on the ramp with Sting slamming Rude on it before doing a hit & move strategy while hopping on one leg as Rude did focus on the knee with clips & using the ring post while Dangerously got involved as well but Sting just couldn't overcome the odds against him due to the earlier attack. This was more to just get the title off him as he would focus on the Luger & the World Championship after this match but this would also be the first match in the classic feud between Sting & Rude in WCW.
""WCW Clash of the Champions XVII"" Nov. '91
[Best Of The Clash Of The Champions]

United States Championship Tournament Final Match: Ricky Steamboat vs. Dustin Rhodes - This was originally the finals of a #1 contenders tournament but the decision was made to strip Rude of the championship due to injury causing this match to determine the new champion while it should also be noted that not only were both men former Tag Team Championship partners but Steamboat was one half of the current champions which he won from Rhodes two months earlier.  Both men showed respect to each other early on with Steamboat gaining the early advantage keeping Rhodes on the ground working over the arm only for Rhodes to perform one of Steamboat's trademark offensive moves against him working over a specific area of the body using his opponent's own body weight & stretches as they traded momentum using some of the same offense against each other & hitting one big move only to come back with another in a competitive contest with the only downfall being how the match ended.
""WCW Saturday Night"" Jan. '93

Steve Austin vs. Great Muta - Muta was able to take control using offense to keep Austin on the mat using superior speed & some impactful offense such as a brainbuster suplex & using one of Austin's own signature moves against him causing Austin to resort to desperate tactics to gain the attention with Col.

""WCW Monday Nitro"" Sept. '97

Raven's Rules Match: Raven vs. Goldberg - Raven took a different approach here than usual as he went right after Goldberg attempting to block him into a corner & even throwing a dropkick before Goldberg quickly recovered tossing Raven into the outside guardrail various times before Raven attempted to use a chair & The Flock but that wouldn't stop Goldberg causing Raven to try to run away only for the fans to throw him back resulting in what went down as ""75-0.""
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Apr. '98
[Very Best Of WCW Monday Nitro Vol. 2; Goldberg: The Ultimate Collection]

Bret Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was the night after Halloween Havoc with DDP coming into this match being very exhausted from his intense match with Goldberg that he showed signs of it from the previous night to the point where at one time Page couldn't apply an armbar correctly so he just went for a pin instead. They traded momentum here as Bret was more focused on brawling & taking shortcuts than out-wrestling DDP such as doing moves like a low blow. This was a good match with a very brutal aftermath.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Oct. '98
[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro]

Goldberg vs. Bret Hart - This was not only a championship match but also the first round the WCW Championship tournament with Bret coming into this match with an injured leg to the point where he was limping to the ring as Goldberg not only showcased his superior power but targeted the leg with stretches & submissions even demanding that the ref keep checking on Bret who refused to quit & fighting back however he possibly could in a match that wasn't competitive but told a good story in regards to Bret's injury.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Oct. '99

WCW Greed '01

""RAW"" Nov. '01

Unification Match: WCW United States Champion Edge vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Test - This was the first of two unification matches to merge WCW & WWE championships together with the winner also securing a job regardless of which company would win the ""Winner Take All"" match later in the night. Test started out the match in his favor taking the match to the outside & dropping Edge on the guardrail numerous times while also using power moves while Edge went for a more aerial attack with various dropkicks including one off the top rope & catching Test in mid-air with another one as they traded momentum throughout the contest such as Edge countering the pumphandle slam while Test hit a spear of his own.

Survivor Series '01
[Edge: A Decade Of Decadence]

Big Show vs. John Cena - The opening match to the 20th WrestleMania started out with Cena attempting offense to almost no effect as Show easily tossed Cena to the outside & kept catching him when attempting offense such as coming off the top rope into a slam or coming off the ropes with a clothesline followed by either moves like a slam & vertical suplex or just punishing him using his size by standing on his back or standing legdrop but Cena kept coming back trying to break Show down by going to his knees before having to resort to some ""thuganomics"" tactics. The match itself was definitely the best match they ever had (which isn't saying much) but was more about the future top guy in WWE winning his first championship in his first WrestleMania match at Madison Square Garden.
WrestleMania XX
[Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden]

Steel Cage Match: Bobby Lashley vs. King Booker - Lashley dominated early on with his strikes & power moves such as a slam & spinebuster while Booker relied on his various styles of kicks & tactics that would normally be illegal under normal circumstances while his Court made their presence known from the outside while taking advantage of Lashley coming into the match with a previous injury as the cage came into play on more than one occasion by both men throughout the match.
""SmackDown"" June '06

""RAW"" June '09

Submissions Count Anywhere Match: Daniel Bryan vs. John Morrison vs. The Miz - For those who didn't see the previous time they did this match (DX vs. Legacy at Breaking Point '09), it's the same as a falls count anywhere match except you can only win by submission. Bryan showed himself to be the submission expert early by working work both Miz & Morrison's legs & later performing a ""cattle mutilation"" on Miz. Morrison showed himself to have a few tricks under his sleep with performing Tajiri's old ""Tarantula"" move on Miz, executing a corkscrew sleep on both Miz & Bryan, and even using Charlie Hass' old ""Hass Of Pain"" submission hold. The fight spilled out of the ring with Miz taking advantage of his surroundings like attempting a dragon sleeper using a railing for leverage, using a stage box on Bryan, and delivering the Skull Crushing Finale on the concrete floor. Morrison showcased his ""par-cor"" style offense such as being able to climb the stage & perform a dive off the stage before doing into Dean Malenko's playbook with the Texas Cloverleaf.

""WWE Network Exclusive"" Nov. '14

John Cena vs. Dean Ambrose - This was Cena's first open challenge after winning the championship the night before at WrestleMania while Ambrose is coming into the match with a bad back from his participation in the Ladder Match.

Rude started off heavily focusing on an area of the body only for Rhodes to give a receipt working over the same area of the body to the point where Rude was showing effects as they traded momentum throughout the contest to the point where it ultimately came down to one man's attempted tactics backfired on him.
""WCW Pro"" Sept. '93

""RAW"" June '15

I'm very satisfied with the selection here as they followed the same formula we got for their World & I.C. Championship sets where we didn't get a bunch of DVD repeats or matches available on their network leaving room for some lost gems & classics made their way to DVD while for the most part ignoring the periods where the championship didn't live up to the legacy they're trying to present here.
The only fault I have is that some matches could have been replaced with other better quality & more relevant performances.  In the end, I recommend this project.",1456272000,6,23219,4.66992904330805

7613727,5,B01AVSFWF8,"The United States Championship was originally known as the United States Heavyweight Championship and began
as a regional championship created by and defended in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling run by Jim Crockett, Jr.
Following the title's introduction on January 1, 1975, Harley Race became the inaugural champion on that exact same day.
The title quickly replaced the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship as the top singles title in the promotion.

While the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) recognized only one World Heavyweight Champion, there was no single undisputed
U.S. Champion as a number of NWA regional promotions recognized their own version of the title and champion.
That all changed, however, in January 1981 when the NWA territory based out of San Francisco,
the last remaining promotion outside the Mid-Atlantic territory that recognized its own U.S. Champion, folded.

The title remained the primary championship within the Mid-Atlantic territory until 1986,
when Crockett gained control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.
The U.S. title then became the secondary championship of the promotion.
After Ted Turner bought Jim Crockett Promotions and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in November 1988,
the title continued to be used and recognized as secondary to the World Championship.
WCW eventually began to slowly pull itself away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA),
demonstrated by the company changing the name of the title to the World Championship Wrestling (WCW)
United States Heavyweight Championship in January 1991.

After WCW was purchased by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship
was defended in the WWF until it was unified with the Intercontinental Championship at that year's Survivor Series.
After the 2002 brand extension and the promotion being renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE),
the championship was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship in July 2003 as a secondary title on the SmackDown! brand.
The title has switched brands over the years as a result of the WWE draft,
the 2017 Superstar Shake-up moved the title back to SmackDown!

There are 36 matches included on the Blu-Ray version of ""The U.S. Championship: A Legacy of Greatness"".
The content really looks excellent from start to finish.

Greg Valentine vs. Roddy Piper - You knew the direction this was going right from the start as both men had such an aggressive lockup right from the start with either man refusing to give an inch to the point where there was an accidental disqualification only for the winner to refuse it because they wanted to settle the score as they traded momentum with both men giving some very intense blows against each other from taking a shot behind the referee to rubbing their face into the mat in what was more of a preview of what was to come in their future encounters (ala Dog Collar Match at Starrcade) in what was a physical encounter.
""NWA World Wide Wrestling"" Mar. '83

Steel Cage/""I Quit"" Match: Tully Blanchard vs. Magnum T.A. - Both men started brawling with each other right away trading fist with both men sending the other into the cage multiple times causing them to bleed only for each other to continue to relentlessly focus on the cut either ripping or biting at it as both men continued to use whatever they could get their hands on to punish each other including the microphone or a wooden chair to the point where anyone else who got in their way would pay for it as this match has gone down as one of the greatest ""I Quit"" matches of all time to the point where it's the standard of what's expected from this type of match as it was exactly what you expected...a violent, physical, bloody war.

""RAW"" June '15

I'm very satisfied with the selection here as they followed the same formula we got for their World & I.C. Championship sets where we didn't get a bunch of DVD repeats or matches available on their network leaving room for some lost gems & classics made their way to DVD while for the most part ignoring the periods where the championship didn't live up to the legacy they're trying to present here.
The only fault I have is that some matches could have been replaced with other better quality & more relevant performances.  In the end, I recommend this project.",1456272000,4,23219,4.66992904330805
