This unlikely decision came about as a result of visiting the extra features after the initially entertaining and edifying  run of 115 minutes of fantastic Hammer trailers  . I'm really not a special features guy the vast majority of the time . In the lower left hand corner of the features screen was the word ""more"" . I thought to myself , what the heck , and was greatly rewarded . Two Hammer Scholars , authors  and historians had a delightfully well  moderated , informative and interesting  conversation about the proceedings  (the trailers) . It was just thrilling to me and heightened the whole enterprise a lot .
Admittedly , the trailers themselves are not often of very good quality , but I cared little NOT being a more persnickety videophile . I own a large percentage of the pictures and so know their better look(s) as well , virtually all the Blu ray's save Paranoiac and The Man Who Could Cheat Death , which I elected not to upgrade to .
There's over fifty trailers here . Fifty . That's a lot . One trailer , The Stranglers Of Bombay , prompted me to both look into and include for purchase a Hammer Collection I'd previously dismissed out-of-hand as simply not for me . Other ""stone age"" trailers appealed to me as well  and caused a similar response .
I'd strongly recommend this collection to all folks who enjoy Hammer films . From the completist to the novice . Well worth the jack . Fascinating .",1409443200,,1546,4.519713261648746
7943438,4,B00005KH28,"After reading a few of the other reviews, I think that this DVD has received some rather undeserved flack for a few different reasons. It includes 53 trailers and 2 behind the scenes clips of Hammer films produced in the 1950's-70's. The first complaint seems to be with the quality of some of the trailers, this is understandable to some degree, but I would suggest those people looking for archival quality trailers check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hammer-Trailer-Collection/dp/B000WBM9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hammer Trailer Collection</a>&nbsp;released by Anchor Bay, which includes some of the same trailers featured on this disc minus the 2 behind the scenes. The Anchor Bay disc is the same one included with some copies of Blood from the Mummy's Tomb. Also, some have mentioned that certain trailers from this golden age of Hammer are missing, however this is because no trailer exists for these films. My only real complaints with this collection would be that the DVD is a little hard to navigate, it has a slight delay when moving from option to option, and the use of some of the alternate American titles for a few films. Other than that it's a fun disc to put on for Halloween parties or during an intermission from film festivals.",1329091200,,1310,5.364077669902913
7943439,1,B00005KH28,"If you are searching for Hammer Horror Movies, try another product. This DVD is about 53 Trailers that you can watch them free of charge on Youtube.com. I think that this product should have more description and should inform the customers in a clearer manner that this DVD contains nothing but Trailers. There are not any movies there. Does any customer in this world want to spend money on watching trailers for movies that were made in 60s and 70s or even 90s? No One.",1232496000,,471,4.552941176470588
7943440,3,B00005KH28,"All Day Entertainment has just released the colorful DVD compilation of 53 Hammer Film trailers. Despite the variance in quality, this one is a treat for the true fan. As a homage to Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, get set for 1 1/2 hours of gory fun. All 4 Hammer Mummy films are previewed.  Christopher Lee appeared in 15 movies as Count Dracula, 7 were released by Hammer. All 7 trailers appear here. Of note is a one-reel short promoting ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"". Gothic cinema expert Gary Smith is on the audio commentary track. As noted, ""The Horror of Hammer"" suffers from some archival quality problems. The trailer for ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" is faded and flat. ""The Man Who Could Cheat Death"" suffers serious sound loop problems. The video picture is 7 to 10 seconds behind the audio. All Day Entertainment's web site promotes ""Prehistoric Women"" as one of the epics to be seen, however, on the DVD, it is not to be found.",997747200,9,949,4.682634730538922
7943441,4,B00005KH28,"A few weeks ago I watched Horror of Hammer's sister release Tales of Frankenstein and was greatly disappointed.  I'm happy to report Horror of Hammer was a much happier viewing experience.
The disc contains over 50 previews of Hammer shockers, including Curse of Frankenstein, Horror of Dracula and its final thriller To the Devil a Daughter.  Also included are a couple of goofy behind the scenes featuretes from the early '70s.  A real plus to the package is an audio commentary from Ted Newsome(?) and two other genre historians. The talk is a fun overview of Hammer Studios.
As with Tales of Frankenstein, the technical Quality of Horror of Hammer is lacking, but an improvement over the earlier DVD.
This is a cool addition to any Hammer fan's DVD collection.",996710400,7,764,4.861538461538461
