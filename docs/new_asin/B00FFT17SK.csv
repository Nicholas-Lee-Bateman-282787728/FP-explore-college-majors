5990645,5,B00FFT17SK,"This is a very fair and informative presentation about meat production in America.  It gives a face and motive to the smaller commodity farmer while informing the audience about alternatives.  Since Joel Salatin is so innovative and he loves to share all of those ideas with everybody, it makes sense that they are incorporated into the ""alternative"" side to meat production.  It's meant to educate and inspire us and I think it does a very good job.",1410048000,,450,4.818181818181818

5990647,5,B00FFT17SK,"When I was a girl the valleys &  hills of Vermont were covered with cows and milk production was the biggest ""industry"" in the state.  That was many a year ago.  These days, most of our farms are gone.  Yes, we still raise cows and produce lots of milk and cheese, but you're just as likely to see goats or sheep or beef cattle as a Holstein these days and much of what we produce are the more labor-intensive and more expensive  artisanal products.  I am lucky that I can buy grass fed local hamburger for only a dollar or so more than the mass-produced stuff at the grocery store, but sometimes the choice is much more stark.  This year Thanksgiving turkey was $0.58 cents a pound at the supermarket or $58 for a 14 pound locally raised turkey.

Meat & egg production makes up  the largest segment of US agriculture.  Industry figures show that in the year 2011 US farmers produced 26.3 billion pounds of beef, 22.8 billion pounds of pork, 5.8 billion pounds of turkey,  291 million pounds of veal, lamb and mutton, and 37.7 billion pounds of chicken.  We consume about half of that production ourselves.  The rest is exported to feed the world.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Meat/dp/B00FFT17SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Meat</a>&nbsp;(85 minutes, 2013) is a very well done documentary that presents a balanced view of the dilemma between the large ""factory farms"" that predominate the farming landscape here in the US presently and the smaller, more natural and more labor intensive  ""green"" farms.

In the documentary you'll meet a hog farmer who has been raising pigs ""factory"" style for decades, then recently formed  a consortium with other local hog farmers to raise organic hogs (he has not left factory farming) as well as Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms, a champion of alternative methods of meat production.  You'll also learn why that supermarket Thanksgiving turkey was $0.58 a pound and the local, organically raised turkey $58.

Grandma's $0.02 - If you're expecting something that slams the American factory meat industry while championing organic farming, you won't find it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Meat/dp/B00FFT17SK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Meat</a>. You'll find no horror tales here.  This is an extremely fair and balanced look at the current state of US meat production and possibilities for the future.  I would encourage every consumer to take the time to watch this.  Highly informative.",1385942400,6,2549,5.435114503816794
5990648,4,B00FFT17SK,"""American Meat"" (2013 documentary; 85 min.) takes a look at the state of the meat producing industry in the US. Did you know that each year Americans consume 58 billion pounds of meat (chicken, cow, pigs)? Me neither. It's a HUGE business. In the first part of the documentary, we get a look at how meat is produced for the most part these days, namely through commodity farming (also referred to as industrial farming). Please note that this documentary is NOT confrontational, say like ""Food, Inc."" or even ""Fast Food Nation"", so no gruesome scenes about the slaughter of cows or pigs. Instead this documentary (which is labeled ""A Pro-Farmer Documentary"" on the DVD jacket) lets the farmers talk about the challenges they face, but also the passion they have for their jobs (""it's the closest profession to being with God"", says one).

In the second part of the documentary, we get to know Joe Salatin, a farmer in Virginia who has come up with some innovative ways to farm in a more gentle manner, with his ""Pigearator"" and ""Egg Mobile"". The documentary essentially becomes a plea for grass-based farming, and examines whether it would be even possible to feed the entire country using grass-based farming and/or whether it could be done in a cost-effective manner. The last part of the documentary asks some pointed questions on what we the consumers can do in all this.

Bottom line: I found this to be an interesting documentary, giving me insights into the current  and possible future state of meat production in this country that I hadn't thought of before. Let me stress once again that if you are looking for a hard-nosed confrontational investigation into the ""mean, bad"" meat producers of this country, this is not the documentary for you. If instead you are open to a different perspective on meat producing in the US, then this DVD is well worth checking out.",1384819200,12,1875,4.816770186335404
5990649,5,B00FFT17SK,"American Meat looks at chicken, cattle and hog production in America. I though it was very well done. It talks a bit about the history of farming, how before World War II all animals were raised on pasture. After that time, farms started using Confinement Feedlots (aka CAFOs) and using antibiotics on the animals and pesticides on our vegetables.

This documentary chronicles the state of the U.S. meat industry. It talks to different farmers, some who are using the confinement methods and some - especially the wonderful Joel Salatin - who is raising his animals on pasture. It really is a pro-farmer movie. One of the farmers who raises hogs using both the confinement and the more humane methods talks about how much better the meat tastes from the hogs who get to be outside and are not confined, and we know it's a more humane life for them as well.

The best part is it offers solutions for how farmers can be more successful raising animals on pasture, and how consumers can afford to buy that meat, not just at the expensive restaurants and stores selling them, but we can do things like join CSA's, buying clubs and buy directly from our farmers. It's better for us, the animals and the farmers raising them. Anyone who eats meat should watch this movie. Highly recommended!",1381708800,11,1285,4.706666666666667
5990660,5,B00FFT17SK,"I showed this film in a class I am teaching about food/food industry. It is a great depiction of our current meat industry in America, not too in-your-face and negative, but still sheds light on what needs to change. Also has some great insight on some of the good that is going on within farming/food production. Not all hope is lost!",1444348800,,335,4.508196721311475

5990662,4,B00FFT17SK,"A good documentary but it doesn't do anything that all the others haven't done already. By this time the audience for this type of doc are wanting in on the processes and techniques of small scale farming. We already know the societal ills that have lead us where we are, and we want to know practical steps we can take to get involved. This is why I paid to rent this video as opposed to watching all the other prime available docs, a little disappointing that it didn't spend more time on the farm with Joel and his crew. He does takes up nearly half the image after all.",1435622400,,573,4.26605504587156

5990664,5,B00FFT17SK,"If you purchase nothing else organic ,buy pastured meat!  It is so much better for for your health. The way conventional farming treats it's animals is inhuman. Crowded living conditions, unnatural diets, antibiotics and growth  hormones, no sunshine or fresh air makes for unhealthy animals, whose meat you don't want to be consuming. This well done, most interesting video takes you on a tour of several conventional farms and several  pastured ones. The video was informative and enjoyable. Watch it for yourself and see the difference in how the animals are raised.",1434153600,,569,5.163043478260869

8615388,4,B00FFT17SK,"This film has one major flaw.!  USDA organic simply means that the product is 85% organic.  The USDA and U.S. government  have been controlled by big industry for 100 years.  Big industry controls the food intake of the nation and the affordability of the consumer.

People are just beginning to understand that they are being killed by the GMO food industry but have little recourse.  I tip my hat to all like Polyface farms that are attempting to point us in the right direction.  For every senator or congressman, big business offers 5 lobbyists to persuade them.
I buy (Certified Organic)  when possible and can only hope that a rich advocate of the little man may one day emerge and rid us of the in place oppressive structure.  Cross your fingers.",1531180800,,753,4.687022900763359
8615389,5,B00FFT17SK,"This documentary was great. I like how they mention people going into debt. If you think about it when a business gets a loan to pay for goods and their worker's salaries because of the debt and the interest on the debt they pass this cost on to the consumer so it creates higher prices. People have estimated that up to 50% of the prices we pay is from interest.

I like that they show the difference between a pastured egg and commercial egg. I like a lot.",1527724800,,458,4.204545454545454

Factory farming should be a thing of the past, it produces less, and contains less flavor and less nutrition.  I've always thought that Americans should be allowed to donate part of their taxes to Small Family Farmers, so we can all thrive.
