4214794,5,B003X2P90S,"After attempting to copy these skits from inferior quality video cassettes for years, I FINALLY have all the greatest bits on DVD!",1302393600,,130,4.954545454545454
4214795,5,B003X2P90S,"Benny Hill was a master of comedy.  Every episode is polished and appears so seamless that rarely will you notice that many segments are sown together from separate tapings.  One such:  during a dance routine, a black dress jumps from one to the other on every drum beat.

While there are these occasional singing and dancing routines, most of each show is pure comedy: high density comedy.  Theses shows require you to watch and listen.  Benny loved to play with the language; his comic songs and tales are loaded with double entendres.  Jokes are literally written on the walls.  There is a skit with dialogue using only letters and another using only names.  He had fun rearranging and parsing titles and signs into hilariously inappropriate meanings.

Benny's silent comedy skits rival the best of the comedy movies from the golden age of silent film.  There are sight-gags galore.  Like Oliver Hardy, he knew how to use ""the look"" when things go wrong.  Parodies, silly interviews, zany cruises, burlesque acts, naughty bits, and much more - all done to perfection . . . .

Alas, not everything was perfect.  If you were one of the many beautiful young women on the show, you probably weren't too happy with the wardrobe department's seamstress.  While they had provided you with stylish and sexy dresses - the lightest tug, the merest snag, or just a piddling pull by a passing clown and ... a loud rip, a flutter of fabric, and then, an uninvited squeal would escape your lips when you realize your embarrassing exposure!  Tsk!  Tsk!  How unseemly . . . .

Picture quality (DVD): 3.5 to 4.  All episodes are in color except for 3 on disc 2.  Navigation to any skit in an episode is easy.  Occasionally, a tiny square flickers in one of the corners.",1298764800,27,1755,4.6819672131147545
4214796,3,B003X2P90S,"This is an excellent set of complete (except for the commercials, thank goodness) Benny Hill shows from 1969 to 1989, the period when he was an established figure on British TV and produced roughly 3 shows a year. The material has been shown on North American TV, but generally in the form of 30-minute carve-ups from the original shows, which were timed to last an hour on commercial television. Here the programs are shown as they were aired on British TV.

Benny Hill shows his range as a comedian, with skits (many visual, without dialogue), interviews, songs, monologues and sketches. Some of the material is repetitive; because his shows were broadcast relatively infrequently, his stock characters seem to appear more often when episodes are viewed consecutively. He also borrowed shamelessly from others and from his own earlier works, so his songs, for example, often have tunes that you will recognize from elsewhere.

Everyone has their favorites among his pieces. I like his interviews, usually with Henry McGee or Nicholas Parsons playing the interviewer/straight man, feeding Benny the cues for a double entendre, a totally inappropriate answer or (when he is playing a character from, say, Ireland or China) an answer which the interviewer (and the audience) completely misunderstands.

You either like Benny Hill (as my Dad did and I do) or loathe him (like my Mom and my wife)! This set is therefore either five stars or one star, so I've awarded it three. Get it if you like his comedy, and watch it when those who don't are busy doing something else.",1297641600,13,1569,4.9581749049429655

4214813,5,B003X2P90S,"This set never gets old. Benny Hill was a comedic GIANT. The sped up musical sketches are my favorites. The guest singers and bands are very good as well. I find that since the British accent is hard to always nail down, some of the jokes take repeated listenings to get. (And sometimes Benny packs so much into a monologue or poem that it is hard to catch everything- but don't despair- he always gives that knowing look or utters the phrase ""think about it..."" to let us know we missed something.) Something as trivial as juxtaposing a letter P for an F (in a poem for instance) becomes gold in Benny's mind and we get to hear the outcome. Hill's Angels are easy on the eyes and a big reason I stayed up late when I was 10 to watch the TV when the parents were asleep. The jokes didn't make sense then but they sure do now.",1464825600,,825,4.19496855345912

First saw Benny's Show on US Television in 1979/80, found out they were edited for US Viewers as some of the material was originally geared for UK Audiences at the time (Note: Keep this in mind as these are the Full Episodes). These include all his Famous Characters, Cast, and ""Hill's Angels"". There are also ""Serious"" Musical Numbers in the early episodes of songs that were popular at the time, that may seem dated to some (including a performance by Kiki Dee long before her duet/hit with Elton John). Hard to believe after watching this Talented Comedian that Thames Television made the stupid mistake of letting him go in 1989, even though he made them millions of dollars!

As a big fan of Benny Hill, I enjoy his great wit and humor...but now as I age and my hearing gets less and less, I had hoped that this Megaset would have subtitles or SDH, but alas it doesn't.  The picture quality is OK, but unfortunately AMAZON didn't disclose that these Benny Hill episodes don't have subtitles.  In the future, please AMAZON disclose whether or not a movie or 'megaset' like this one has English subtitles or SDH.  With a growing population of retired folks with varing degrees of hearing loss, having movies with subtitles becomes more and more necessary.  I suggest that AMAZON specifically address this issue with your many movie vendors as this is a growing need.  I ask that you revise your selling and description policies to include whether or not a movie has subtitles because while I will keep this set, if would have been nice and appropriate to disclose this factor so a buyer is aware of a manufacturer taking short cuts like this.

The show format looks back to the sketch comedy of the earlier era vaudville acts of the 30's and 40's.  While the shows share some similarity to sketch comedy shows like Monty Python, Benny Hill places is his own unique very silly spin on his comedy.
If you enjoy Benny Hill, you might also enjoy the American comedians Red Skelton and Carol Burnett.
Unfortunately, my hearing is not the best, so sometimes his comments / poems are a bit difficult to understand / hear over the laugh track.

4214975,5,B003X2P90S,"I have to face it: my parents are old, and they're cranky. I ordered this and kept teasing them something great was coming, and they shrugged me off. The night I plopped this in their lap while they watched TV, I saw their faces light up like kids on Christmas day.  My dad in particular couldn't wait to play one DVD after another, and before I knew it he was laughing loudly and slapping his knee, disturbing our cats. Totally worth the price.

Being born and bred in the US, a lot of the dialogue skits are so thick with Hill's accent that we skipped through those. There's also a lot of cultural reference jokes that we just don't get. A lot of the singers and bands that appear are completely unheard of here as well. But, it's the crude humor and the non-narrative skits that even coughs up a laugh or two from my desensitized throat. Yeah there's some nudity, but in this day and age, barely even noticed.

Very memorable sound effects that I heard of as a kid and still imitate these days, like when Hill repeatedly slaps the old cast member's head several times. Stuff like that just never gets old.",1366675200,15,1108,4.3951219512195125

You get so much Benny that you can't run out assuming you remember the good ole days when you laughed at the same skit month after month.

4214980,4,B003X2P90S,"I used to enjoy watching The Benny Hill Show. This set contains Benny Hill shows from 1969 to 1989.
There are three volumes in the set. Each volume contains six disks.
Volume 1: 1969 to 1974 - 21 episodes.
Volume 2: 1975 to 1981 - 20 episodes.
Volume 3: 1982 to 1989 - 17 episodes.
There is a rather spartan booklet (one sheet, quad-folded) in the first volume that lists the tracks for all eighteen disks. It lists skit titles for each show, but it does not give production information or dates.
When you insert a disk, you must endure: the FBI warning, a plug for A&E Home Video (quite loud!), a plug for Fremantle Media, and clips of shows--all before the main menu appears (about one minute and fifteen seconds). You cannot circumvent this.
The main menu for each disk lists only the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 (for the shows on that disk). There is no alternate audio and no captions--open or closed. There is no option to play an entire disk.
When you select a show and press Play, you get a list of tracks within that show. If you press Play again, it plays the entire show. If you select a specific track, it plays from that point to the end of the show. Playback stops after each show and displays the main menu again.
The disks played equally well in a component DVD player or the DVD drive of a computer (using WinDVD).
The video and sound quality are very good to excellent. I did not try all the disks, but the ones I tried played well.",1357603200,86,1445,4.2967032967032965
4214981,5,B003X2P90S,"Every Benny Hill Show Fan has their favorite Benny Hill Poem and I remember the part of one I love most of all.  My favoiteBenny Hill poem bits went something like this.  ""Cleopatra sundered past clasping her little asp and I wondered how those red lips of her's tasted.  Just then one of my friends was heard to snicker EGad she's got an hour glass figure and I said OH YES AND NOT A MINUTE OF IT WASTED!""  Come on weird wit that that is priceless.  Benny Hill was a total joy.  I grew up watching Benny Hill late Sunday nights and my grandmother hated him with a passion which made the pleasure that much more intense.  I was pretty much a good kid, a straight arrow.  I did not do drugs, I drank infrequently and Thank God I never got into trouble with the police.  I felt great that as a teen growing up my watching Benny Hill with all its vulgar sexual overtones drove my very prim proper conservative grandmother over the deep end just a bit.  I was always reminded that I was such a good kid, it was nice to have a big black mark by my name for liking what my grandmother considered painfully vulgar comedy.  Yeah my grandmother was a hard core Christian and she hated Benny Hill but my Grandfather and I loved watching Benny Hill every Sunday Night.  Benny Hill brought me and my Grandfather together as my Grandmother threw up her hands with us MEN!  My watching Benny Hill was the first time my Grandmother lumped me into the lost cause she felt defined the moral baring of most men in the face of pretty ladies.

I watched Benny Hill mainly because he was fun.  I had better ways to drive my grandmother crazy and I used them regularly I suspect being autistic and all.  But again buying classic Benny Hill Episodes all at once lets me relive some of the fondest memories of my childhood both on and off the screen.  Benny Hill let's me relive the best parts of my life spent in front of the TV.  As an Autistic Kid I did lots of TV watching.  Watching TV usually helped me learn a lot about this strange world filled with people who do not have autism.  Benny Hill did not teach me much about the world but what Benny taught me was still priceless.  Benny Hill taught me how to laugh at life and see the nasty underside of everyday happenings.  For me to get a Benny Hill Megaset is awesome and certainly worth its price.  Benny Hill was Nutz we won't know his like again!",1357257600,2,2384,4.272321428571429

Very clean films that were not remastered, but the ones I've played, so far, look good on a 65-inch TV. Keep in mind that they were not wide-screen, but the old, narrow TV format, so, to avoid veiwing distortion, set your wide-screen TV for narrow screen (1.33 to 1) with grayed out vertical bars on the sides.

The only negative of ""Benny Hill"" is that his absurd humor is addictive. Once I started watching, everything planned for the evening was dumped, since I couldn't stop watching this superbly executed humor.

An added plus were his female trio singing those ancient songs that us older viewers enjoyed. They do it well, one per show, apparently.",1356220800,27,799,4.659574468085107

KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING: This is not actually a complete selection of episodes of the benny hill show, it is only the time it was on Thames.  There were many other episodes broadcast by other channels before and after these were produced.  For example there was some black and white episodes on BBC.  Start with this set, if you still are crazy go track down the other episodes.  This is still a great collection.

ONE MORE THING: there is no episode listing in the DVD liners.  I will list it at the end of my review for you to print out.  I hope you find that helpful.

4214994,4,B003X2P90S,"I'm a big fan of Benny Hill and could not wait to watch 48hrs of him!  What you get is six hours repeated eight times,  the gags get more refined the sets more elaborate but basically the shows just repeat with a small amount of different material thrown in so your not totally bored.  The set is packed six dvd's into three cases for a total of eighteen dvd's,  for the set I received this caused damage to the innermost tracks so I wasn't able to watch some bonus material or look at the trivia, but it really did not bother me because what I did see of the ' bonus hill's angel's interviews' these also were repeats of the same theme, I had wanted bonus footage of the show and all I got was filler.  By the time I got to the damage it was too late to return, and I just could not be bothered, it not like i'm going to miss anything.  Amazon was great, shipped promptly, arrived a day early, packed well enough and I was happy with the price of thirty eight dollars,  had I paid the one hundred seventeen I would have felt ripped off . My memory had me belly laughing, the dvd's just had me smiling, oh, for the simple times, the humour is simple, unsophisticated and just what you need sometimes, I guess I am at that jaded stage of life on my way to crotchety.",1349136000,12,1265,4.1387755102040815
4214995,5,B003X2P90S,"I was so lucky that I found this mega set, exactly the same original on sale here for only $21.99 at COSTCO Wholesale store Miami and the video and audio quality is very good as far as I`ve seen in this 18 discs collection, go for it, and search for better price.",1340409600,2,263,4.076923076923077
4215016,5,B003X2P90S,"it is a fine movie,makes you remember old times;I consider it as a classic of all times,you don't really need audio not even a single word,you can understand any scene so the only thing you have to do is  by just see it and  enjoy it.",1335052800,,234,4.065217391304348
4215017,5,B003X2P90S,"There is just something about the comedy of Benny Hill that I get a charge out of. I have learned that not all people think he is funny, some think his humor is sick. So I guess I am one of sick ones that really likes his humor. If you like Benny Hill you can't go wrong with this set. They did a great job with this set.",1330214400,,321,3.735294117647059
4215018,5,B003X2P90S,"Like Laurel & Hardy, Benny Hill belongs to the funniest comedians of the 20th century. It's a very, very small line between brillancy and banality. And he is allways on the ingenious side. I can recommend this set without any qualification.",1315440000,,240,4.878048780487805
4215019,5,B003X2P90S,"As a person who grew up during the 1980's, I can tell you that Benny Hill was an important person during my childhood. Every Saturday or Sunday, around 11:00pm, THE BENNY HILL SHOW was always on and ""Yakety Sax,"" the theme tune, firmly implanted itself into my consciousness. But now watching THE BENNY HILL SHOW on digital subchannel Antenna TV is a Friday night ritual for me; I always make a point of watching the three hour block (11:00pm-2:00am)! And now with BENNY HILL: THE COMPLETE MEGASET from A&E, we can now see ""The Lad Himself,"" as Americans have never seen him before!

This box set contains all of BENNY HILL: COMPLETE AND UNADULTERATED in one simple set! All 58 of the original specials as transmitted on British television from 1969-89 are here. There are so many hilarious sketches that Benny has done that I can't  name them all in one review, but here are some of my favorites:
-New England 1635
-Learning All The Time! (both versions)
-Getting To Know You
-all the Chow Mein bits
-Peter Seymour: New Political Correspondent
-A Poem: Faith, Hope, and Charity
-Cleaning Up Dimpton

And here are my favorite Hill's Angels routines:
-Hot Gossamer (a takeoff of Hot Gossip)
-Madame Louise's Summer Collection
-Down The Road with Hill's Angels
-Hotel Splendide

The set also includes BENNY HILL: THE WORLD'S FAVORITE CLOWN (made prior to Benny's death in 1992), the Biography episode BENNY HILL: LAUGHTER AND CONTROVERSY, the short film EDDIE IN AUGUST, and three Hill's Angels interviews (I WAS A HILL'S ANGEL, HILL'S ANGELS: OFF THE RECORD, and HILL'S ANGELS: IN CONVERSATION) which include Sue Upton, Alison Bell, Alison Thomas, Jo Thomas, and Carla De Wansey. And of course, the Cheeky Challenge Trivia Quiz on every third disc. This is the be-all, end-all Benny Hill DVD collection! Highly recommended!",1309824000,,1836,4.951298701298701
4215020,5,B003X2P90S,This is one of the greatest collections around. i remember watching some of these episodes on TV  years ago. it sure brings back plenty of memories.,1308182400,,148,4.6923076923076925
4215021,4,B003X2P90S,"I have been watching Benny Hill since a teen.  Fantastic.  I shed a tear when I learned of this death.  Benny Hill is at the top of my list of the best comedians ever.  This set is a must have for now, but I wish...  I wish it had English subtitles.  Why you ask?  I am an American and sometimes British accents throw me off a bit.  There are several words in his limericks (I bet most of you Americans don't understand all of his words) that I don't understand.

If this set had English subtitles, it would be a perfect set.  Unfortunately, it doesn't; hence, the four stars.  Maybe I will get a bunch of friends over sometime to watch and we will figure all the words out, but most my friends don't care for him.  What is wrong with these people!!!!  Benny Hill is a LEGEND!!!!!  What they don't get is their loss.

I can watch this over and over again (which I have trying to figure some of the words out, but I got some of them, but there are a few that elude me...  Damn you subtitles!!!!).

Listen to me, this set is well worth it.  Hope you enjoy it with a Old Peculiar.  It works well with Benny Hill.",1306627200,4,1109,4.098130841121495
4215022,5,B003X2P90S,"If you asked any fan of British comedy, particularly of the zany ilk, if they've ever heard of Alfred Hawthorne Hill they may look at you as if you were daft.  Mention Benny Hill and you'll probably get a smile of wide-eyed amusement and a few guffaws.  No, not everyone loves Benny, but those who do are big fans.  Hill was somewhat of a flop in radio and and lukewarm on the stage, but once he hit television ... well, let's just say the rest is history.

This fantastic collection of 18 discs is housed in three cases which can easily be stored/stacked.  Inside each case the discs are placed in a flip style for easy access.  The first case houses 21 episodes, including three rare black-and-white episodes from 1969 to 1974.  Bonus features include a documentary (""The World's Favourite Clown""), Hill's ""Laughter and Controvery"" from A & E's Biography series, and two Benny Hill Cheeky Challenge Trivia Quizzes.  The second case houses 20 episodes from 1975 to 1981.  Bonus features include ""Eddie in August,"" ""I was a Hill's Angel"" feature, and two Benny Hill Cheeky Challenge Trivia Quizzes.  The third case houses 17 episodes from 1982 to 1989.  The bonus features include ""Hill's Angels:  Off the Record,"" ""Hill Angels:  In Conversation,"" and two Benny Hill cheeky Challenge Trivia Quizzes.  You're getting approximately 48 hours and 29 minutes of some of the zaniest, nutty sketches you've ever seen.

There is a small booklet that lists all the episodes.  You can select individual sketches from the discs.  The only problem is trying to find individual ones as they are not listed in alphabetical order, but then again as you scan the lists you're sure to find some that you remember.  I once had several of these on VHS, but years ago they were difficult to find and quite expensive, to say nothing of the problem storing them because of the bulk.  With the number of sketches you are getting (five hundred eighty-five), this set is a real bargain.  The color and sound are excellent and appears to be consistent from disc to disc.  For additional fun, bloopers are included.  When many people hear ""Yakety Sax,"" undoubtedly they think of Benny.  Do you?",1306627200,4,2167,4.781671159029649
4215023,5,B003X2P90S,"If you are a fan of Benny Hill, you cannot go wrong with this boxed set of his shows. Some television shows of a 20-30 years or so ago have not aged very well but not our Benny. It's as entertaining now as when first watched. Great purchase.",1305849600,,241,4.041666666666667

4215025,5,B003X2P90S,"The Benny Hill show is the best show ever.
The Hill's Angels were the sexiest women that ever lived.
The show was really good before 1979, but was even better after that, from 1979 all the way to 1989.
I don't care what anybody says about the later years.
My favorite bit was ""Superteech"" from 1983.
My favorite Hill's Angels routine was ""Runaway"" from 1981.

Now about the Complete Megaset. The one released in 2010, the one with Hill standing next to the guitar.
This one is exactly the same as all the previous releases, i know because i have them all, the first Megaset, and all of the individual releases before that.
This one is the best, because all 58 episodes come in three standard DVD containers with six discs in each container.
The entire collection fits into one hand, making it great for traveling. Like when visiting boring relatives.",1305331200,65,850,4.629139072847682
