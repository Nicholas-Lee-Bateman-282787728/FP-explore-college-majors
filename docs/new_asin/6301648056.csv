7813846,4,6301648056,"Another event that I was able to find online in Wrestle War '90: Wild Thing as this event took place near the end of the NWA run going into the early stages of WCW. Now the story behind this event was that the main event was scheduled to be Sting vs Ric Flair for the World Title but due to Sting's unfortunate injury at the Clash of the Champions X, Lex Luger turned face (again) & stepped up to the challenge. Now as I have said before at the time, these early WCW events were edited down but since I saw the actual card, I have no idea what has been edited down although I heard the main event is a bit edited.

Kevin Sullivan & Buzz Sawyer vs The Dynamic Dudes. This was just an alright opener that I really didn't care too much about.

Cactus Jack vs Norman The Lunatic. DP explained this match perfectly in that ""other than seeing Mick as skinny as a cruiserweight, nothing special here"", I will second that statement because I just found this match to be lackluster.

The Midnight Express vs The Rock & Roll Express. The first match of the night that I was excited for as this was two of the best tag teams in the NWA going at it in their classic series of tag team matches. This was a high quality match that just had non-stop, fast-paced action from bell to bell with Jim Cornette providing comedy towards the match that included him getting into a supposed fight with the referee Nick Patrick that just had me laughing so hard. This was my favorite match of the night & another classic tag team contest between these two.

Chicago Street Fight: The Road Warriors vs The ""New"" Skyscrapers. This match was just to end this storyline as the orginial members of Sid Vicious & Dan Spivey were removed from the equation so a masked man & ""Mean"" Mark Callous (who would go on to future fame as ""The Undertaker"") were entered to represent them. This match was really short & nothing really memorable as the most memorable part came after the match when Doom (Ron Simmons & Butch Reed) came to ringside to get into a physical confrontation with the Warriors.

NWA United States Tag Team Champions Brian Pillman & Z-Man vs The Fabulous Freebirds. This was just a great tag team match as both teams tried to wrestle at their pace as Pillman & Z-Man tried to speed things up in the early stages before the Freebirds attemped to ground them & keep the pace at their level until Pillman & Z-Man were able to work at that same level itself. This wasn't as high-flying as Pillman's or Z-Man's matches normally were so this was a treat to see them hold their own when it came to mat-wrestling resulting in another great tag team match.

NWA Tag Team Champions The Steiner Brothers vs Arn & Ole Anderson. Before I begin, it's amazing to see so many tag team matches on this card considering how limited we see them nowadays with well established tag teams. The story here was the Steiners looking for revenge for what the Horsemen had done to Sting as the Steiners were really aggressive here & just taking it to the Andersons before Arn & Ole did what they do best & that was take a body part & heavily focus on it to the point that Scott just couldn't hide the pain that his shoulder was in. Another quality tag team match on the card.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs Lex Luger. Flair came into this match with Woman at ringside while Luger was eventually joined at ringside by the injured Sting who was on crutches from his knee surgery. Luger was never really one of my favorite performers but during this time, he was (for the most part) on fire & that was the case he here as he just kept bringing the fight to Flair whether the match stayed in the ring or out includng using various power moves that you could just see start taking it's toll on Flair. Flair was able to work on the legs of Luger but Luger wouldn't be denied this time until the appearance of Arn & Ole Anderson forced Luger to make a choice that would cause him having the title slip through his fingers again. Even though this was just a feud to further time till Sting was healthy again, this was one of my favorite Flair/Luger matches within their series.

Overall, this was one of the best cards that the WCW/NWA had as with the exception of two opening matches, the event was quality from start to finish so I would recommend if you can find a copy of this event or even find it on the internet.",1298419200,,4361,4.3423312883435585
7813847,4,6301648056,"Once again, thanks to WWE 24/7, I was able to catch an old school classic event from the early days of WCW & towards the end of the NWA in the Wrestle War '90: Wild Thing.  This event was suppost to be headlined by Sting vs. Ric Flair for the World Title however due to Sting's injury at the Clash Of The Champions weeks earlier, Lex Luger was given the title match instead.  Keep in mind that the event was edited down to two hours however since I saw the live PPV replay & not the tape version, I don't know which matches were edited. One thing I do remember is that the opening video music was a rap mix that is so sad, you can't help but laugh at it.

Kevin Sullivan & Buzz Sawyer vs. Dynamic Dudes - Just a decent opener at best.

Norman The Lunatic vs. Cactus Jack - Besides seeing Mick Foley looking as skinny as a crusierweight, nothing special here either.

Rock N' Roll Express vs. Midnight Express - If anyone knows the history between these two teams dating back years then you know that you'll expect the best tag team action possible.  This match was no exception as you got everything great about tag team wrestling: double teaming & building towards the hot tag, great in-ring wrestling & storytelling, and even the comedic spot with Jim Cornette including the classic one where he gets into verbal conflict with the referee & teases a fight between the two.  Another classic match in their series of matches.

Chicago Street Fight Match: Road Warriors vs. New Skyscrapers - This match was just to end the Skyscrapers feud but it was real a moot point as both original members of Sid Vicious & Dan Spivey were out so a masked man & Undertaker...oops, I mean ""Mean"" Mark Callous replaced them.  This match was real short & eventhough the Skyscrapers got their shots in a times, it was mostly all Road Warriors with the only thing noteworthy being Doom now alligning themselves with Teddy Long & getting into a post-match brawl with the Road Warriors.

United States Tag Team Champions Brian Pillman & Z-Man vs. Fabulous Freebirds - A rematch from the U.S. Tag Team Title tournament finals (which is available on Pillman's DVD set).  Just like the earlier Rock N' Roll/Midnight Express match, this was another classic tag team encounter as the match revolved around mat wrestling & storytelling instead of the usual high flyin' that would expect from Pillman & Z-Man.  Still, a great tag team 'bout.

NWA Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers vs. Ole & Arn Anderson - Wow, four tag team matches in one card.  The Steiners were out for revenge for their friend Sting based off the Horsemen kicking him out of the group & injuring him.  The match mostly revolved around the Steiners always building momentum while the Andersons kept breaking it by going to the outside or breaking the rules.  The Anderson's would later target Scott Steiner's arm & work it non-stop like the Anderson's are known to do before Rick is tagged in to get the win.

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - Luger was using his power moves during the beginning moments of the match against Flair before he regained the advantage for a while with Woman getting involved from time to time.  From here, the match went back & forth with Luger relying on his strength along with submission holds like the sleeper & even Flair's own figure four.  Flair targeted Luger's legs in the final moments of the match as Sting appeared to give Luger an ""adrelline rush"" before leaving to save Sting from an attack by the Anderson's & getting counted out in the process.  One of their best encounters eventhough you knew this feud was just to stall time until Sting got better but it did it's job in returning Luger to a babyface.

In the end, this is one of the best of the late NWA/early WCW days.  However, just like all the tapes from this time...the event down to two hours including editing the main event so you don't get the complete show & with the two dull opening matches, I'll give this 4 stars instead of 5.  However, this is one ""forgotten"" event that I highly recommend.",1207180800,3,4054,4.546079779917469
