7956900,5,B00005YDTO,"I've been experimenting with my piano technique for a few years, getting my hands on every technique-related material available. My main breakthroughs came from Taubman Technique and Barbara Lister-Sink's ""Freeing the Caged Bird"", but this video helped me try some new, really helpful ideas. Soya Haydon shares many unique exercises which I have not seen in any other methods. I'm glad for this because the more fresh ideas you try, the more new insights you gain! Or.. strengthen and confirm the understanding you already have. For example, there's a ""knuckle push-up"" exercise, and doing this exercise lets you learn the sensation you should feel when you have the perfectly arched hand (which feels really nice and effortless) I've tried a similar knuckle exercise that Seymour Fink recommends, but his approach uses the other hand to pop outward the knuckle of the pinky. His and Soya's approaches both helped. It's nice to confirm through two different sources that conditioning your knuckle is the key to forming the perfect arch with your hand :)",1422662400,,1053,5.127906976744186
