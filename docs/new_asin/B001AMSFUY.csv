8278076,1,B001AMSFUY,"With so many releases of The Lost World 1925 available, what makes this one the one I should buy? Does it have a better picture than the restored version? Does it have a better soundtrack than any of the other versions? Because if there is one thing this movie suffers from it's a lousy soundtrack. I've heard six different soundtracks, and they're all terrible. Does it have bonus features not found elsewhere? Tell me, why should I drop up to 15 dollars on a cheap dvd-r when professional dvds are available at a lower cost. You see, after taking a bath with a2zcds ""remastered"" ripoff I am very cautious about what I buy. So once again I ask, WHY SHOULD I BUY THIS EDITION?",1294444800,,676,4.459677419354839
8278077,5,B001AMSFUY,"Loved this movie.  I know it's been bashed a lot by today's audiences, but you have to consider that when it was made special effects were not what they are now.

I think it's the story that counts.  My two cents anyway.
In addition, what also impresses me, is that several scenes and actors reapeared in ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (series)"" and other Irwin allen productions.  It's great to see earlier performances as well as the inevitable stock footage Irwin and Fox used.

Especially of note are really great performances of David(Al) Hedison (later Capt. Crane in Voyage), and Ms. Marcus (the native girl) who shows up later on Voyage both as the same native girl, and also as a love interest for a ghostly u-boat captain! I think it's rather fun to see the orig. movie while picking out 'hey-that was used over there'scenes)

As I said, the story itself is good.  It's entertaining,and doesn't try too hard.

I think it's worth the purchase and I'd like to see it released in widescreen format as it was originally shown.  You miss some things in the regular format, but hey, it's not available in widescreen, so I'm just glad to have it at all.  It hasn't been available for awhile at all.

I'd suggest you just settle down in a comfy chair and just enjoy it.",1213488000,,1273,4.5152838427947595
