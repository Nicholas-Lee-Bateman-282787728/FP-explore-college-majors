8066714,2,B0009UKUEM,"I honestly hated this dvd.

I felt there was too much focus on the upper body & it gave me muscle spasms in my upper back & neck trying to follow along.

I also felt that it wasn't truly geared to a pregnant woman's body - especially if you are the least bit out of shape before hand.  A lot of the exercises I just couldn't do without a spotter to watch me and be there to help me.",1167782400,4,382,3.810126582278481
