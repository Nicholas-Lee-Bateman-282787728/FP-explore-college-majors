7003748,4,B00TADFHJW,Great snapshot of an era!,1434240000,,25,4.2
7003749,5,B00TADFHJW,"I watched this on Google Play.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Great band (with a top notch guitar player) that I came across by accident way back in 1987.  This 2015 documentary (rockumentary) details the bands history and high points and low points.  They had more than one chance to sign a record deal but ... well, you'll have to watch the video to see what happened.  97 minutes.  Never a dull moment.",1431648000,3,396,4.3561643835616435
7003750,5,B00TADFHJW,Grear rock doc. Great band with a tragic ending.,1430265600,3,48,4.444444444444445
7003751,5,B00TADFHJW,"The story is about following a passion, friendship, perseverance and determination.  It's about having a dream and following it, unfortunately, not always realizing it.  It pulls at the heart for so many reasons.  I was riveted from the beginning to the end.  You don't need to know the band to love the movie.  You connect with the characters. It is so well told and tissues were necessary for me.  The music was amazing and the talent of these musicians should not be discounted because they are not a household name.  After seeing this film, their name should be.",1426032000,5,566,4.714285714285714
7003752,5,B00TADFHJW,"Tuff Luck was a band that only released one album on a small record label back in the 80s. Do they really deserve a feature length documentary telling their story?After watching this film, the answer is YES!

This movie fits in alongside the other great music docs that have that have been released over the last several years. (The story of Anvil, Searching for Sugarman and A Band Called Death).

This movie does a great job telling the story of a young band with all of the elements for success that were just never able to make the leap to the next level. It's the ""Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda"" story that is experienced by every group of kids who picked up guitars and jammed in their garage. That story with all the ups and downs is well told here.

The movie is professionally shot and edited and has great interviews with band members, friends and family. This is very well done for an indie film. If you're a fan of 80s Metal or a fan of great documentaries, you will enjoy this movie.",1425859200,11,990,4.428571428571429
7003753,5,B00TADFHJW,Criminally underrated this band and their story is now documented in this kick butt DVD that truly shreds...It has a little bit for everyone and If you like rock docs...You will LOVE this one...I give it 2 Metal Horns UP!!!!,1425859200,7,224,4.625
7003754,5,B00TADFHJW,Holy Freakin Cat Crap!!! One of the greatest bands ever! So weird they weren't bigger than Cre! Can't wait to get this in my DVD player!,1425427200,4,136,4.269230769230769
7003755,5,B00TADFHJW,"This is not just a film about a band.  It's about 4 friends that shared a dream.  It's a coming of age story featuring 4 virtuoso musicians who would have been considered among the best ever, had fate dealt them a better hand.  There are thousands of bands that never made it big.  Very few have a story worthy of a film.  You will laugh.  You will cry.  You will find yourself rooting for these guys and you'll be left asking the same question as everyone else who loves this band.  Why weren't they a household name?

The DVD contains hours of bonus materials.  Director's Cut with commentary by Kenny Monroe and Dave Scott, deleted scenes, trailers, and a full length concert.",1423180800,10,679,4.491803278688525
7003756,5,B00TADFHJW,"Well, I thought this was great! What a fantastic film about friends, music of a certain time and place, and considering its all true, it felt like a fiction movie. What a well made film, and such a cool story of a bunch of talented guys. I have friends who are in that same kind of place, and I really get it the whole chasing your dreams.......I think that's all we can do in life! Well made, not cheaply produced, or at least it didn't feel ""cheap""....I enjoyed the narrative and the interviews and hanging out with a few musicians for an hour and a half or so.....",1461369600,2,567,4.2592592592592595
7003757,5,B00TADFHJW,If you love this genre of music you will live watching this. It's a shame because the we're so talented and they had the gold ring in their hand but did not grasp it....it's a life tail of if we would have...,1461024000,,208,3.9761904761904763
7003758,2,B00TADFHJW,"A story about a bunch of ""neverweres"". If you want to see a sad story about a band that never really went anywhere with no real interviews from peers of industry then this is the film for you. I you just wanna laugh at a band's misfortune then I highly recommend it.",1459209600,,266,4.134615384615385
7003759,5,B00TADFHJW,Great!,1458864000,,6,6.0
7003760,3,B00TADFHJW,"3x better than ""Tammy"". Fairly interesting look into what was apparently an exceptionally talented band w/ unfortunate timing and a very tragic turn of events who understandably are still coming to terms with what happened.",1458259200,,223,5.4
7003761,5,B00TADFHJW,GREAT JOB ANDREW! This was an awesome documentary on Tuff Luck! My wife actually had tears in her eyes towards the end. Looking forward to the show at The Funky Biscuit! Thanks for your hard work on this project.,1457049600,,212,4.461538461538462
7003762,5,B00TADFHJW,Very accurate depiction of the scene in the late 80s... Must see!,1456617600,,65,4.5
7003763,2,B00TADFHJW,hair band was okay,1454889600,,18,3.75
7003764,5,B00TADFHJW,Great doc!,1454371200,,10,4.5
7003765,3,B00TADFHJW,ok,1453420800,,2,2.0
7003766,4,B00TADFHJW,"Being a teen of the 80's and an active person in the hair band scene, this was a real interesting watch.  Nice to see the whole behind the scenes and the glory or consciences of the bands decisions.  Tragic tale of four guys who just loved to play music and couldn't reach their pinnacle.",1448236800,2,288,4.314814814814815
7003767,5,B00TADFHJW,"A sad doc about a great band that should have been huge, that also made a lot of bad decisions.",1447286400,,95,3.8
7003768,4,B00TADFHJW,"I really liked the band members although I can totally understand why they never made it. Not having a manager to steer their career was perhaps the biggest factor in the band not finding the right music niche or right city to build their following.

The documentary itself is made well enough but runs a few minutes long. There are also times where I wasn't sure who was being interviewed. It's biggest sin is failing to present the music in a way that was compelling. I didn't feel any urge at all to check out their music after the documentary ended. And this is the kind of music I grew up with!

With that said, it's definitely worth checking out if you like rockumentaries but it's not the feel good doc that Anvil or Not Dead Yet are.",1446854400,,741,4.36231884057971
7003769,5,B00TADFHJW,Very cool DVD.  Awesome guitarist.  These guys had a lot going for them; it's really too bad they were not able to get a major label debut out there during this type of music's heyday.  I'm sure the drummer would be very proud of his brother's efforts.  Well done!,1445558400,,264,4.326530612244898
7003770,1,B00TADFHJW,They make this look like a documentary on all kinds of rockers who don't make it. Like you are going to see a lot of examples. This is a documentary about ONE SINGLE band. It's like it was family financed. Very disappointing.,1443830400,,225,4.380952380952381
7003771,5,B00TADFHJW,"A very good example of an exemplary band of musicians who were at the whim of fate and timing. Not a spoiler, but one chance encounter with a well known South Florida producer was probably their critical mistake. That is heartbreaking. Truthfully though, they were talented enough to transition naturally away from metal at the right time. Had things been just every so slightly different... you never know.",1443484800,,407,5.0
7003772,5,B00TADFHJW,"A very well told story that at first resembles the classic ""Behind the Music"" of all the great bands that made it big. Unfortunately, instead of hearing about how the eventual excesses of success destroyed another great band, you learn a tale of a group of friends who did everything right, they focused on the music, they were cohesive, they avoided all the pitfalls of the "" Rock n' Roll"" lifestyle. But in the end, they simply came up short. Like the millions of bands that you never hear about that were simply not in the right place at the right time. I was very touched by the story of friendship and how the guys stuck together through thick and thin. Reminded me of a great time and place in my younger years of being in a band and having dreams of ""making it"". I was very sorry for the loss at the end. It is never right to lose someone who was loved by so many.
 Must see movie!",1440028800,,888,4.223529411764706
7003773,5,B00TADFHJW,I saw Tuff Luck open for Stryper at L'amours in Brooklyn and was forever hooked. Always wondered why they didn't make it big. This DVD tells their story.,1439078400,,153,4.5
7003774,5,B00TADFHJW,Awesome!!!!!,1437523200,,12,12.0
7003775,5,B00TADFHJW,"It a great documentary,one of the best I've seen,had the tape years ago would like to get CD soon,tuff luck was a great band that for some reason never got off the ground hope this is helpful to anyone who is a fan of kick a#s hard rock,they where bad a#s!!",1435363200,,257,4.0588235294117645
8701118,5,B00TADFHJW,"Very interesting and a bit sad, a really good documentary of a band that seems like they kinda screwed their selves a few times, but still shouldve been in the spotlight, very good musicianship",1507507200,,193,4.705882352941177
8701119,1,B00TADFHJW,"I could not watch the whole entire movie, at the end of the concert the disc was scratched, I could not see the end of the live concert.  I could not see the movie fully and completely, at the end of the live concert the dvd did not play the last portion of the film. it stopped playing because it had too many scratches.  I tried to clean the dvd with my own personal cleaner and the whole live in concert part of the dvd still did not play.  I would like a refund of my money back or another replacement would not be a bad idea because I still could not see the film that I wanted to see.  Please give me back an answer on what you are going to do.",1506384000,,650,3.8646616541353382
8701120,5,B00TADFHJW,I used to go see these guys all the time back in the days i personally got to meet Dave Scott really sad story they should of made it to the top like Dave said they couldn't of picked a more suitable name for the band i honestly felt there pain such a telented band.,1492560000,,266,3.8545454545454545
8701121,5,B00TADFHJW,Really well directed and interesting doc on an 80s and early 90s band that you never heard... but should have!  A pack of hungry musicians that had the talent but never quite achieved the next level.  I found it compelling all the way through.  If you like BEHIND THE MUSIC style docs... and 80s melodic hard rock... you will enjoy this.  Highly recommended!,1488931200,2,358,4.634920634920635
8701122,3,B00TADFHJW,Good story on what could have been a great band. I spent too long trying to figure out if it was a fake documentary or not,1485734400,,122,3.730769230769231
8701123,5,B00TADFHJW,All Good,1475193600,,8,3.5
8701124,5,B00TADFHJW,sad that a band this great never made it big great documentary,1474070400,,62,4.25
8701125,4,B00TADFHJW,"This was a good band that should have gone a lot further, I was always curious what happened, why they never ""made it big""
what happened to the guys in the band? this DVD answered those questions, and more.
If you are a fan, you will enjoy this DVD. it's a good insight on what so many bands of that era went through,
I just wish that the music was available on CD or downloads, all I had was a cassette that has long since worn out.
As a fan, thank you for sharing your story, good job.... now go get the music out there on iTunes or something so we can
enjoy it!",1468886400,,564,3.956140350877193
8701126,4,B00TADFHJW,"Expectations were low, but this was very good.",1465171200,,46,4.875
8701127,5,B00TADFHJW,Excellent documentary. Showed what it's like when you don't make it in the music business. Really poignant moment in the film when the mom apologizes to the son for encouraging him to go after his dream. Being a musician didn't really prepare him to be a successful person when the stage lights faded away.,1463443200,,306,4.685185185185185
