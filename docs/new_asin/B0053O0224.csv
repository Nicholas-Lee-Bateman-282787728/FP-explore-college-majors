It has stayed with me all these years and even though the acting is a trifle contrived when revisiting it, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Seeing some of the Australian Outback again also brought back fond memories. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning a little of the history of early Australia.",1456963200,,396,4.753623188405797

8455312,3,B0053O0224,"Adapted from a classic Australian adventure novel by Rolf Boldrewood, which was based on actual events, ROBBERY UNDER ARMS (1957) is, essentially, a Western, except that it's set in the Australian outback.

The story tells of two brothers (Ronald Lewis, David McCallum) whose father (Laurence Naismith) is an outlaw, riding with the notorious Captain Starlight (Peter Finch), a cattle rustler.  Seeking adventure and a way out of their dull rural life, the young men join up with Starlight to pull off the largest cattle theft in Australian history.

The brothers take the proceeds of their deed, parting ways with both Starlight and their old man.  They plan to go straight,  but when the law starts pursuing them, they are forced to rejoin the outlaw leader and his brutal gang.

ROBBERY UNDER ARMS is a good story but, although this filming features some nice performances, impressive cinematography and several exciting action sequences, particularly the final shoot-out, it is not as well told here as it could have been.

The screenplay by Alexander Baron lacks depth.  The characters are two-dimensional, thus we really never become that invested in their fate.  With the exception of the aforementioned action scenes, Jack Lee's direction is lumbering, making the story unfold in a very episodic manner.

Jill Ireland, who was once married to McCallum before she married Charles Bronson, plays her former husband's wife in this picture.

Directed by Jack Lee

British Invasion brings another release from VCI.

Beautifully filmed in Australia and based on the novel by Rolf Boldrewood.

The color is a bit off, but it does capture the stark contrasts of the Australian outback - the parched land, the unrelenting sun and the tough times experienced by the settlers.

The lead role of Captain Starlight went to Peter Finch who gives a superb performance.  Here he steals the show representing the typical Aussie bandit, with quite a bit of polite finesse.

Supporting roles are very good, with Maureen Swanson the standout performer as Kate Morrison, the woman spurned by Dick Marston (Ron Lewis); not a woman to be tossed aside, as he finds out. David McCallum, in his fifth movie, plays the other brother Jim Marston who gets involved with Kate's sister, Jean (Jill Ireland).

In this film the elder Ben Marston played by Laurence Naismith who leads a life of crime in the outback. One of my favorite British actors Laurence Naismith who was so good as Mr Fezziwig the proprietor of a warehouse business, which is where Ebenezer Scrooge (Albert Finney) got his first ever proper job in the film ""Scrooge"" (1970).

The final scene is full of action with a shootout filmed very realistic from many camera angles.

Special footnote:  -- Actress Jill Ireland was married to actor David McCallum during the filming and the marriage lasted 10 years, a divorce followed she then married actor Charles Bronson until her death in 1990.
