6877469,5,B00QR1JYJE,"This film is rarity for me in Scorpio Films in that I had little or nothing to do with it when it was being made. I didn't donate any money, no extra work, and was only on set for the 1st day of shooting. That being said as I have said with all of Scorpio's films, I really enjoyed it. The film revolves around Billy a really good church going kid who is in his first relationship with a non-church member named Shannon who convinces him to join her local theater group run by Lou Perdition. The theater group has a bunch of misfits like D&D gamer Traci, gay kid Lance, music snob NuWave, druggie Bandilli, and theater diva Kimberly. What no one suspects is that Lou has lured them all there so he can raise his master Dracula and help him create a vampire army to conquer the world. Written by Michael Varrati and directed by Richard Griffin, the film is shot with the same excellence you would expect from Richard and extremely well acted. The cast is Jamie Dufualt as Billy, Sarah Nicklin as Shannon, Samantha Acampora as Traci, Aaron Peaslee as Lance, Jesse Dufualt, as NuWave, Derek Laurendeau  as Bandilli, Elyssa Baldasarri as Kimberly, Tobias Wilson as Marty, Michael Thurber as Dracula, Johnny Sedequest as Scott, Carmine Capobianco as Pastor Johnson, and Steven O'Broin as Lou Perdition. Normally Michael Thurber dominates the screen (and he does bring an amazing intensity as Dracula) but since Richard decided to keep him mute (like Christopher Lee in Dracula Prince of Darkness) the film's best stuff is done Steven O'Broin as Lou Perdition. Steven's portrayal as Lou is so over the top evil it almost makes you think the other characters must be mentally challenged to not notice it. O'Broin is absolutely brilliant and takes a great delight and being wicked. Another favorite of mine was Derek Laurendeau as Bandilli the over top druggie. Another fun film that will have you enjoying the 90 or so minutes you spend watching it.",1432339200,2,1942,4.711764705882353

6877472,1,B00QR1JYJE,My heart went out to Michael Thurber for having to be in this.  He is totally out of everyone else's league here.  No one in the film measures up to him.  Great actor with drivel material.,1430006400,6,188,4.166666666666667
6877473,5,B00QR1JYJE,"In 2012, director Richard Griffin made one of the most entertaining low-budget horror flicks in recent times with MURDER UNIVERSITY. It's a film full of black humor, satire, and is a loving tribute to 80s slashers. After that, the director followed with DR. FRANKENSTEIN'S WAX MUSEUM which was a nice love letter to Hammer horror films (and SCOOBY-DOO) that is highly entertaining (if a bit less polished and smaller in scope than MURDER U). Then we have this year's SINS OF Dracula which could almost belong to a loose, unofficial ""triology"" with the other two movies given their common casts (predominately focusing on young protagonists), subject matter and themes (horror, dark humor), and setting (loosely, the 1980s). And while MURDER U and WAX MUSEUM were tributes to certain sub-genres and cinematic movements, SINS is perhaps most interesting for being a biting satire of Christian scare films. Yes, the no-budget cautionary propaganda tales probably produced by your local church in the 1970s and 80s (even if films of the type have never really disappeared). Plenty is taken from the great popular and cult cinema of the 70s and 80s too with the film feeling a lot like 85's FRIGHT NIGHT at times. In addition, the film makes nods to everything from one the most famous horror films of the 70s to blaxploitation movies. Oh yeah, and if you couldn't tell by now, the film just so happens to involve Dracula and a satanic thespian intent on raising that Prince of Darkness from the dead. Some might be disappointed by how little this movie actually has to do with 'ol Fangface, but you should know what you're getting into if you've seen the film's trailer (or watched the film's first act).

As a film, SINS is considerably well crafted. Easily one of Grifin and co.'s best looking films and perhaps the closest one aesthetically to the 70s/80s exploitation films it's trying to ape (without needing the added dust or scratches of THE DISCO EXORCIST). There's great camera-work (among it a crane shot, and lots of stylish zooms) and excellent practical effects by New England gore-wizard Jordan Pacheco. Sure there's clear use of plaster mannequins played for laughs, but there's plenty of stuff that feels like it belongs right smack in a Hammer made Dracula movie. Furthermore, the film is headlined by great music consisting of hilarious diegetic numbers and a fantastic Euro-cult flavored score by Timothy Fife. Fife's pounding synth score is (for lack of a better word) quite sexy and brings to mind the work of Italian maestro Riz Ortolani (with a pinch of Italian prog rock band Goblin).

Plenty of Scorpio Releasing regulars line the cast and many of the leads from MURDER U return to star. Jamie Dufault has lots of charisma in the lead role of Billy while NUN OF THAT'S Sarah Nicklin gives a memorable (and hugely adorable) turn as his girlfriend (probably ranking as my favorite of her roles). Also returning is Samantha Acampora who gives plenty of zest to her role of Traci-- a D&D nerd. Supporting actors are great as well with Carmine Capobianco being hilarious as Billy's pastor, and Steven O'Broin (FUTURE JUSTICE) once again making a superb villain. Michael Thurber (who already excelled at playing Dr. Frankenstein) is a great presence as Dracula and brings to mind the best of old school Dracs Christopher Lee, John Carradine, and Bela Lugosi in his (mostly silent) performance. Everyone seems to be having fun here and Michael Varrati's script is extremely witty and plays with cinema tropes and societal stereotypes to maximum comedic effect.

In sum, SINS is a hugely entertaining film that will no doubt make a killer triple feature with Griffin's earlier MURDER U and FRANKENSTEIN'S WAX MUSEUM. See it!",1429574400,4,3737,4.956937799043062
6877474,1,B00QR1JYJE,"I would like to think of myself as a B Movie expert , I have seen just about every B Horror Movie out there and yes I take pride in that claim. I then have to warn you that this may be one of the worse B Horror movies I have ever seen and I would tell you to stay away from it period, the acting is horrendous the plot is ridiculous and well even the soundtrack is horrible !! If you do see this film just remember to go and watch a Hammer Horror movie with Christopher Lee just to redeem yourself .",1429488000,13,499,3.8076923076923075

6877481,1,B00QR1JYJE,this douche Dracula should die unseen for the benefit of cinema. These producers should find another career path.

6877485,3,B00QR1JYJE,"Any number of bad memories of failed translations or permutations of Stoker's classic will most likely well up within you when you watch this. It features many of the requisites for B-movies: ham acting (although it is done with great flair), ludicrous dialogue, and odd camera work. All that being said, I have seen worse. A lot worse. The redeeming factor for me here is that the actors don't lose their appeal. They recite their lines with earnestness and hit their marks in action sequences. The subject matter isn't totally besmirched (The backhanded appreciation of Christian values slips off the edge into blatant mockery numerous times), but I still found the film entertaining.
Special props to Steven O'Broin, who channels his inner ""Master Thespian,"" as the Satan-loving theater director, and Michael Thurber, who gets a lot of mileage out of his smirk while portraying the (as usual) silent Lord of the Undead.
If you are looking for classic Hammer-style horror, look elsewhere. If you're in search of horror laced with humor that does not spit on it's subject matter, and whose cast actually seems to like their work, check this one out.",1452988800,,1150,4.994791666666667
