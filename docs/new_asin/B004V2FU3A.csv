""Aan Milo Sajna"" is a movie about weird people, most of whom are either funny or frightening depending on your disposition.  I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately trying to figure out if I'd find Varsha (Asha Parekh's character) charming if I met her, or if I'd just want to deck her.  The thing about Varsha is if you DID plan on decking her, she'd probably deck you first, and that's one reason everybody in the film loves her so darn much. So, its up to you how you judge. The film was above average at Box Office. Music of the movie is given by Laxmikant Pyarelal duet.",1304812800,,741,4.4411764705882355
