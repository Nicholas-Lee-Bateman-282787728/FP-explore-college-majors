8375613,3,B002NZK5P0,"This movie is gorgeous, and a very cute story, but I just want to warn parents of young children:

Early in the movie, some kids tell the main character there is no Santa, and that parents are the ones who bring the presents. Now, obviously the movie shows there is a Santa, but to have the kids say it so blatantly seems to me to be unnecessarily taking the risk of planting a seed of doubt.

Also, if you care about the true origin of St. Nicholas, or a Christ-centered Christmas this film isn't for you. There are 7 or 8 retired Santas, the new Nicholas is kidnapped from an orphanage to be the replacement, and a few times, it is said that if one thing happens, ""All the magic of Christmas will disappear forever."" One of these things would be if the magic ball that gives Santa his powers breaks.

So all in all, a highly secular film with kids planting Santa doubts in the beginning, but if you don't care about those things, I think you'll love this movie. It is beautifully animated, the characters are loveable, and the message of pureness of heart carries the whole heartwarming film.",1510963200,,1094,4.432835820895522
