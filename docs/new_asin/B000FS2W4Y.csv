8125769,5,B000FS2W4Y,"My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them. They are his favorite and I don't think that will change for a very long time. Thomas provides great life lessons like sharing, caring, and friendship. They get a thumbs up from me as well!",1174262400,4,283,4.3584905660377355
8125770,1,B000FS2W4Y,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it.",1167350400,16,356,4.1
