8295788,5,B001DZLP82,"Filmed on March 2nd, 1970, this film records The Soft Machine at the bands peak. Lyn Dobson is in the band and on the DVD. For me, the band is tight and right on target as they were in 1970.

Two different clips of the concert. It is the only sanction television release of the band during that time. Hot!
Good quality film visually and for sound. Voiceprint",1282521600,7,358,4.264705882352941
8295789,5,B001DZLP82,"Good recording of Soft Machine around the time of the 4th album.
While it is mostly late era Third and Fourth, what I found great
was the high band videotape recording, converted from PAL or SECAM.",1261958400,4,197,4.5
