8134323,5,B000GS7WFC,"Excellent script/play and acting.  Trevor Howard's former prosecutor is outstanding.  And Fawlty Towers lovers will enjoy seeing Connie Booth in this as well.  This really should be on current media because I'd love this on DVD.  For those in community theater, I'd recommend picking up James Jaffe's play and submitting this wonderful show in place of an Agatha Christie play as a  wonderful change of pace.",1444435200,3,408,5.121212121212121
8134324,5,B000GS7WFC,"An original, one of a kind script! Superbly cast and performed. Lost among the legendary annals of live stage. I remember seeing this on HBO in the early 80's for the first time. It caught me off guard and stuck with me ever since. In a category all it's own. You can feel yourself and George Segal being teased and drawn into a spiders web, unable to retreat to safety and then ultimately daring the preposterous premise and the authority of the members of this sovereign castle home in Europe.",1344902400,5,495,4.511111111111111
8134325,5,B000GS7WFC,"I also first saw the 'Deadly Game' back in 1982 or 1982 when it was on HBO.
My father was actually watching it, and He mimicked a line ""Gustaf knows, Gustaf knows everything"". I have had that line in my head ever since and I have been looking to find this video for quite a long time now.

My father has passed a few years back, and this will bring back fond memories.

Thanks Amazon!",1216512000,9,384,4.1066666666666665
8134326,5,B000GS7WFC,I first saw the 'Deadly Game' back in 1983 when it was on HBO. It is extremely interesting and the acting is tremendous (George Segal). It is done on the stage and it feels like you are at the theater watching it. It is one of the best films I have seen.-----Matt Wade,1169596800,10,268,4.0754716981132075
