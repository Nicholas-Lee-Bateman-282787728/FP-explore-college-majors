8434066,5,B002806W3E,"The Not So Big House: Home By Design book and DVD was excellent.  It gave insight into what a not so big house is all about.  Sarah Susanka's presentation was excellent!  I would love to see more DVD's on each of her books.  I have all of her books and find her information and concepts interesting and helpful.  I would love to have one of her homes, they're so cozy and warm,  and represent quality.  I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for a home not a house.",1337126400,2,476,4.222222222222222
