5374910,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Wow!  Breathtaking cinematography makes this a must-see film for anyone.  Be careful, however - after your friends from out of state see this film, they'll be moving to Idaho!!",1357689600,,176,5.0344827586206895
5374911,5,B00A1AU6SA,"5 stars does not come close to justifying the breathtaking beauty that is depicted in this video! It brought tears to my eyes to find out I live so close to some of these places, and didn't even know it. I've lived in Lewiston,Idaho for 11 years now, and as me and my wife watched this video,we mapped out our next 3 or 4 vacations. I will NOT let myself be denied the gushing of emotions I felt watching the video, to take place in person!",1356393600,,440,4.127906976744186
5374912,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Idaho, The Movie opens up the High Definition vaults at Wide Eye Productions and PBS to bring forth a visual stunner of a film!  Idaho has always been tucked away in those majestic peaks, out of the sight of most travelers going through on the Interstate to somewhere else.  Filmmakers Tom Hadzor, Jennifer Isenhart and the Wide Eye team take us to the secret delights few have ever seen, bringing Idaho's people and places into the limelight with love and dazzling talent.  Writer/narrator Tim Woodward is an inspired choice to lead the uninitiated up mountains and through river passages into the secret heart of Idaho where outdoor adventure is on everyone's mind and opportunity is as endless as the scenery.",1355356800,9,712,4.916666666666667

5374914,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Amazing. Having lived in Western Washington State for a good chunk of my life, Idaho always seemed like this place in the boonies, who the hell would want to live out there? Who would even want to visit. On a multi-month cross country road trip, I drove through parts of Idaho on the way to Montana - the most memorable experiences being bugs on my truck windshield, a potato museum, and the Craters of the Moon park.  Turns out I missed the most interesting parts! I would have never imagined such beauty and raw landscapes - even after traveling the world over and them some.

I think the fame of Yellowstone certainly draws attention away from Idaho. Perhaps for the better.",1476144000,,677,4.586776859504132

5374928,3,B00A1AU6SA,"High quality landscape photography of Idaho's most beautiful natural areas, but nothing about its history, cities, economy, demographics, politics, colleges, statistics, and challenges. To get information about those topics, this helps: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho
To me this movie was one dimensional. To me the story of Idaho should include more than just pretty scenery.",1436486400,,381,6.346153846153846

5374930,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Having grown up in the state of Idaho, I was very happy to see that this film captures the state at it's finest. It is an excellent introduction to the beauties  of Idaho for those who have not been there, and made me a bit homesick to go back!
If you buy this dvd, you won't regret it!",1425254400,,286,3.9310344827586206
5374931,5,B00A1AU6SA,"I could watch this over and over again.  I live in Texas and you hear about Colorado with mountains and rivers but Colorado has nothing like this.  I guess Idaho is just so un-developed that most people never see this state.  This video showed so many beautiful places from crystal clear lakes, to rugged snow capped mountains, to raging water falls.  Who would have known that Idaho has all this.  It is interesting to note that no cities, towns, or homes are shown in these beautiful places.  It is all nature and the beauty that God has created.  Idaho is a hidden gem that I hope I get time to explore.

One note.  When I was watching the preview for this it kept showing this guy with a horse in a corral and I almost didn't buy it because I wanted to see the scenery of Idaho and not some old guy talking about his horse.  They could sell way more of these if they had a trailer that showed some of the scenery that is in the DVD.",1421625600,3,936,4.17877094972067

5374951,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Makes one proud to be an Idahoan!  The beautifully presented natural beauty, cinematography, and Tim Woodward's narration are all in tune. ""Idaho the Movie"" is a testament to how nature and the preservation of it's majesty can move the human spirit and bring us back to the common ground we all share as inhabitants of this magnificent land we call home!

5374956,4,B00A1AU6SA,"This is a fabulous movie. The cinematography was incredible, and I loved watching about the places that I hadn't seen.

With that said, I was extremely disappointed when I found out they didn't distribute this movie on Blu Ray. The movie was filmed using super high quality cameras, and then they shot themselves in the foot by only making it available on DVD. Hopefully they'll redistribute it someday in a higher quality format.",1377993600,,430,4.890410958904109

5374961,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Idaho has always been under-state-d. In a fitting manner, this peaceful presentation is delivered evenly, except the visuals keep boiling over in stunning vistas, and the eyes soon go nuts. 'Idaho' will make its citizens proud. No gimmicks, effects or fillers, these are natural wonders; places with space, not people. For nearly an hour, the outside world is shut down, and you are there. Unlike a state tourism product, it's cine-art from folks of a deep love and respect for the land. Very close to a Nat Geo package, this is about topography, wildlife and water variations. The narration is through well qualified individuals. No glitz.

Idaho lies between my roots in Nevada and Montana. The journeys to and through Idaho, dozens, all captivating, year-round. Variety? Start with 'taller than Niagara, deeper than the Grand', go uphill from there. How big is the movie, and state? Idaho also separates British Columbia from Utah. Moose and sand dunes? Just maybe. More border states: WA, OR, WY. There's Yellowstone N.P., The Continental Divide, two time zones...Many of these features weren't mentioned in movie, but they are in view. Plenty of room for a sequel, that's the scale here. It's not boastful, it's impressive. Take a chance, watch this natural pageant of light, color, contrast and angle. If you truly love the unspoiled outdoors, there really isn't much choice!",1366416000,3,1381,5.110619469026549
5374962,4,B00A1AU6SA,Wish they were larger but they are perfect otherwise. They are just as described and my Granddaughter will Love them.,1365724800,,117,4.9
5374963,5,B00A1AU6SA,"I highly recommend this video for anyone that lives in Idaho, thinking about moving to Idaho, or just like to travel and wants to visit Idaho!  Amazing video and very motivational to get out of the house and take some scenic trips!  Very professionally made as well!  Will recommend to all my friends!",1362787200,,301,4.6415094339622645
5374964,5,B00A1AU6SA,I love this movie. Reminds me of home and it's so beautiful and peacful. I highly recommend it to everyone!,1362182400,,107,4.4
5374965,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Awesome presentation.  Kudos!  I am an Idaho native.  I've lived in Southern, Eastern and Northern Idaho.  I've traveled all throughout the state and personally seen many of the subjects in this film.  Now, after watching this movie, I am hot and ready to hit the roads and see more of the beautiful Gem State.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful state in such colorful splendor.  Something else folks ought to do is explore for all of the fabulous and intriguing gems and minerals and crystals.  Add rockhounding to your visit...and Dutch Oven cooking.  See!  You got me on my Idaho soapbox. See Idaho -- The Movie!  You'll love it!",1359590400,7,632,4.7592592592592595
5374966,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Being an Idaho native, I was intrigued when I ran across this film at Costco in Boise. After standing around watching it play on the demo TV for about 5 minutes I knew I had to pick it up. The cinematography was pretty amazing. I was definitely in awe during many of the scenes. Whether you're an Idaho native, have an interest in Idaho, or just love a good documentary, this film will certainly make a great addition to your collection.",1359331200,,437,4.407407407407407

5374968,5,B00A1AU6SA,"Absolute perfection must have been the goal of the filmmakers, and they came very close to hitting the mark. The wildlife shots were superb, the mountain vistas were breathtaking, and the cities and towns were conspicuous in their absence. As it should have been.  Living on the Washington side of the border near the north west panhandle, we would love to have seen more of this part of the state, and Lake Coeur d'Alene did not get its rightful due.  Priest Lake and Lake Pend Orielle also got shortchanged, but all things considered, it was still a beautiful presentation of the beauty that is Idaho.  If the State Tourism Agency doesn't jump into promoting this DVD, along with support from all of the Chambers of Commerce, they are missing a great opportunity.  When can we expect the sequel?",1358899200,3,797,4.753623188405797

5374971,5,B00A1AU6SA,"I just finished watching this incredibly beautiful movie.  I was born in Council (Idaho) and grew up in Orofino, as my father followed the lumber industry.  My husband, two daughters and their families and I now reside in the Coeur d'Alene area.  Watching this film makes me wonder why I've never explored more of this great state.  This film is so well done.  The whole thing is simply breathtakingly beautiful and so well narrated.

Our whole family loves this area so much that I can't see any of us ever leaving but there are sure places that I'd like to visit!

All they show is Southern Idaho and left out all the history and beauty of the northern part of the state. The silver capital of the world is in North Idaho, the CDA river with all the aspen lakes and small towns. Waterfalls and ancient cedar groves in the CDA mountains. The man who did this should be very ashamed.",1505347200,2,409,4.061728395061729
