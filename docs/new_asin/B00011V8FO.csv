1968143,5,B00011V8FO,"I viewed this movie on Lifetime Movie Network (LMN), liked it, and purchased a copy.  Justine Bateman has always been a favorite and since I like romance-suspense movies, this was perfect for me.  Lisa Temple, played by Justine Bateman, wakes up in a hospital not knowing who she is, why she is there, or who that ""gorgeous"" guy is who Dr. Holcross, her psychiatrist, has told her is her husband.  Peter Outerbridge portrays Paul Temple, a man who thinks his wife is faking the amnesia because he was going to serve divorce papers on her that morning.  Lisa intuitively knows Paul is not glad to see her, does not ""like"" her very much, and when she asks Paul about it, he does not answer her.  Dr. Holcross has told him not to be confrontational, and he is following doctor's orders.  However, Lisa does not know that and is determined to find out who she is, what happened to her, why people don't like her, why they are walking around on eggshells, and why that room is locked and only Paul has the key.  There is a mystery man in the picture, too, and for some reason she is unnerved by him.  It is a story of love, hurt, secrets, and forgiveness.  There were three scenes in this movie that were not in the LMN version.  Two scenes answered questions I had and the third scene was a nude scene with younger actors which did not add to the movie.  The love scene between Lisa and Paul was tastefully done (Justine B. and Peter O.) and there was no need in my opinion for the nude scene because in the movie Lisa and Paul had been married for 6 years and the two actors used did not even look like them.  If you are expecting the movie to be like the book, you will be in for a shock.  The storyline is completely different, with the exception of a few lines and a couple of names that stayed the same.  All in all, I liked the movie and am glad I purchased it.",1257120000,,1863,4.255681818181818

1968145,4,B00011V8FO,"I saw this movie on TV several years back and the story stuck with me.  I'm happy to have the chance to own this movie on DVD.  It's filmed in my hometown, Toronto.  The main character wakes up from a coma and doesn't know why her family is so against her.  She has a mysterious past that haunts her throughout the story.  She's very vulnerable and it's nice to watch the love rekindled between her and her husband.  The plot keeps you guessing until the very end where there's an exciting and heart-breaking twist.",1212364800,,515,4.425531914893617
1968146,5,B00011V8FO,"I'm a hopeless romantic. I grew up reading Harlequinn Romance novels since 12-13yrs old. My mom's an avid romance novel reader and a HUGE fan of Harlequinn books, I guess I picked it up from her. This romance novel make you feel you are the female character and are going through whatever she is dealing with. I felt how she felt, and had tears in my eys when she did. This love story was so sweet and full of love. It made me feel as if I was in the romance novel. The ending was exciting and fulfilling. I love how the story ended happy!",1198108800,,539,4.142857142857143

1968148,5,B00011V8FO,"I was enchanted and pleasantly surprised by this film. It is the story of a young woman who develops amnesia following an accident, and is brought home afterwards by her young, handsome, successful husband, who acts cold and distant to her. She later learns they have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for years, and are facing a pending divorce. She cannot get anyone, not even the psychiatrist who treated her both before and after the accident, to share with her why her once-happy marriage fell apart, or why she became abusive to her husband's adolescent sister who lives with them. Then there is the mystery of the dangerous-looking man in the old car who appears to be stalking her.

I found both of the main stars to be subtle and believable in their roles. Peter Outerbridge, as the husband, is cautious and coolly courteous, with an underlying sadness and perhaps just a touch of hope that their once happy relationship can yet be restored. Justine Bateman's character is fragile and frightened, and most anxious to win over her forgotten family. Little bits of memories fall into place as she views photo albums, hears stories about the past, and visits familiar places. She falls in love with her husband all over again, and becomes a dear friend to his little sister, but still cannot remember all the details of her former life, and the event or events that transformed her into the monster that she apparently became in the years just before the accident.

I have seen hundreds of mystery and romance movies, and read hundreds of books. But the climax during which Justine Bateman's character learns the truth about her past, while not exactly earth-shattering, caught me completely by surprise. This film left me feeling upbeat and warm and fuzzy, with a renewed hope in the power of forgiveness.",1112227200,32,1813,4.864077669902913

8005612,5,B00011V8FO,I saw this several years ago on TV and  wanted to buy it.  It's an excellent movie and Justine Bateman does an excellent job. My only negative comment would be that they added a nude scene at the beach with other actors who looked similar to them. We could have done without that!  It did not enhance the movie and the performers did not look like Justine Bateman or her husband. Otherwise a really goood movie.,1394582400,,411,4.381578947368421
