Get over any reluctance you might have to deal with subtitles, and give yourself the opportunity to enjoy an excellent film.  I am tired of being taken in by reviewers'/promoters' bumpf, and I've found myself recently about ready to give up on film as having anything new to show me.  But -- this film is one of those rare, genuine, moving, delightful presentations of humanity that shows the high potential of this medium.  My hope and enthusiasm for film is renewed, thanks to writer/director Carine Tardieu.
