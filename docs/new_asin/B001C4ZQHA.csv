8286053,5,B001C4ZQHA,"I've been looking for a copy of this for ages. I had it once, and it was expensive. I was so exited to find it for half what I paid, and it shipped quickly. Great product at a great price.",1356393600,,188,3.725
8286054,5,B001C4ZQHA,"DVDs come in slim boxes that hold the discs in place very good.  Extras are pretty much standard Clean opening and ending, some concept art and some previews.
The show it self is very entertaining and may be one of the best anime to come out in the past 10 years.  On the surface it looks like another Evangelion-clone but the series is so much more then that.  I really don't know what else to say other then it should be in any anime fan's collection.",1319414400,,453,4.244186046511628
8286055,5,B001C4ZQHA,"The series is phenominal, so if you are ordering you probably already know that.  I was concerned because this came from an unknown shipper and for a price that was much less than many other sellers.  I was concerned about the quality and was very please to receive the product and find it to be exactly as advertised.  The seller (not Amazon) sent the series in the best packaging I have ever seen with a sturdy box and internal cardboard frame and packing that custom fit the DVD box set.  Very impressed and highly recommend.",1292284800,,528,4.526315789473684
8286056,4,B001C4ZQHA,"I was ready to give this box set a one star rating. First off, it's advertised as Volume two. For fans of anime who don't actively buy DVDs or just pick up a few titles here and there throughout the year - this can be very misleading. Along with the new cover art, some people might immediately come to the conclusion that this is season two of the series, but that is not the case. The box set is also labeled as ""The Grand Canon Collection"", which might throw people off as well. However, this is just a re-release of the first box set. The only exception is that this set includes the Rahxephon movie which was not included in the first set.
I'd like to gripe and complain about this because I'll have to purchase the movie separately. The anime business is nothing new. So, the movie should have been included with the original box set release. Why it wasn't, is beyond me.
However, underneath the hefty price tag is a great anime series. The artwork is a bit less bubbly as you don't have the characters with the huge big eyes. This only adds a bit more realism to this series because of the way the characters are drawn. But I digress.
This series once again involves a boy who can magically control a robot during a cataclysmic attack on earth and the human race. This theme was booming in anime during the mid nineties and was heavily explored in a few series. This meteoric rise of boy and mecca started flooding the TV waves when magical girl shows like Sailor Moon and shows of school girls with magic powers came to a close. Of course, this and Neon Genesis Evangelion are the big names that instantaneously come to mind. There was another series that I actually enjoyed which probably didn't get that much attention, called, Dual Parallel. Once again that is also a story of a boy who can control a robot.
If you own the original box set this isn't worth it. But, if you don't own the series or any of its DVDs and you want to start owning the collection - this is the box set to get.",1229904000,16,1997,4.342245989304812
