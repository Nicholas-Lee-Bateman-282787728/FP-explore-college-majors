468875,5,630245333X,"My guess is, this great film got bad reviews from the critics.
I can't imagine why.
THE BLOB is a remake of the original Steve McQueen movie. The plot deals with the town hoodlum, who makes a terrible discovery....a  government experiement that started out as a biological warfare virus, but  turned into something MUCH more deadlier.
For me, this film really works.  The government conspiracy themes, the ""town in utter chaos"" theme  and the general gore of it all are ingredients for a fine horror film. Even  though THE BLOB has that late-80's horror atmosphere, the plot devices get  past all that and make a HIGHLY enjoyable and entertaining  movie.

468935,5,630245333X,"Everything was fine in our sleepy little northern California town until a homeless man witnessed a meteor fall from the sky.  Upon further investigation, he finds the meteorite contains some pink, bubbling, alien goo.  The mucous-dripping, pulsating, organ-like mass propels itself onto the mans hand andwellyou know.

High schoolers Meg (Shawnee Smith; Saw 1-3 & 6, The Grudge 3) and Paul (Donovan Leitch Jr.; Cutting Class) find their first date interrupted when they hit the now-parasitized hobo with their car and take him to the hospital along with Brian (Kevin Dillon; No Escape, Entourage), a wildly mulleted juvenile delinquent.

That homeless guy gets it bad. After digesting his hand, the alien slime melts his innards.  You see, this organism is composed of a highly corrosive acid (think Alien), and as it digests you, it grows (more like Calvin in Life).  But Paul gets it the worst with a scene worthy of the movie poster.  He is enshrouded in a slimy digestive veil of death as the weight of the gook pulls the skin off his melting face and Meg pulls his arm, reaching out for help, gorily asunder from his disintegrating body.  Deeeelish!

The local Sheriff (Jeffrey DeMunn; The Mist, The Walking Dead) and diner waitress (Candy Clark; Amityville 3-D, Zodiac, Cats Eye) fall into the blobs path and Bill Moseley (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, The Devils Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw 3-D, Smothered) and Art LaFleur (Trancers 1-2, House Hunting) have cameos as well.  Much to our satisfaction, this horror movie cares about its characters and uses them well.

Director Chuck Russell (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, The Scorpion King) does a fine, gory job honoring the 1958 classic with this sci-fi/horror remake. Im quite fond of how Russell plays to classic tropes by sparing the virgin in lieu of the more promiscuous Vicki (i.e., Erika Eleniak; E. T., Bordello of Blood, Dracula 3000), yet violates expectations as nice guy Paul dies somewhat early leaving our young criminal antihero to save the day.

When our extraterrestrial bioplasm gets Vicki, it digests her from the inside out, collapsing her husk of a drained face as slimy tentacles emerge from her orifices before the rest of the amorphous mass emerges to engulf her date.  Its a great scene!  This film seems to have a lot of great, gore-tastic scenes.

The diner sink, the phonebooth scene, the movie theater and sewer and church scenes everywhere the blob goes, so follows a memorable, gory scene.  Where ever there is a crack or doorway to be found, likewise there is an opening through which this living ooze may erupt towards its victims like an offal-guts slinky.  There are so many excellent special effects pieces to be found.  This has loads of bloody gobbled-gook, a myriad of tentacles, and at one point it pours across the ceiling a la The Thing (1982).

If you have discovered a love for 80s horror and somehow haven't seen this yet, just buy this. REALLY.  Its an excellent piece of 80s horror cinema.  It even has a good ending!",1496880000,5,3068,4.895551257253385
468965,5,630245333X,"I watched this as part of the ""4-movie horror unleashed"" dvd set, which also includes Fright Night, Christine, and The Seventh Sign. But I wanted to review just The Blob as well. This is an amazing, really underappreciated horror film. It is body horror, so if you're not into gore, then maybe give this one a miss--otherwise, this one is great. The cover art pretty much let's you know what you're getting (people being dissolved as they're eaten alive by the blob), but they've also updated the original film to include a government plot and a young-rebel-makes-good storyline that I personally appreciate. It also has a young Shawnee Smith, who Saw fans will recognize. If you've studied horror films at all, then you'll recognize quite a few uncanny moments in this one, as well as the required abjection and a final girl. As other reviews have noted, this one compares well with the other great 80s body-horror remake, The Fly.",1496016000,,932,4.83125

Look at some of the creative minds involved and you will not be surprised with Chuck Russel of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 fame directing and co-writing, and Frank Darabont also of Dream Warriors fame and The Shawshank Redemption also co-writing. The film is a wonderful update of the original that, in my humble opinion, actually bests the Steve McQueen film. Plus it has aged well both from an acting and effects perspective.

468994,5,630245333X,"The Blob (1988) is a remake of the classic 50s sci-fi film of the same name starring Steve McQueen. This remake starring a young Shawnee Smith (Amanda from ""Saw"") and Jeffrey DeMunn (from ""Green Mile"" and ""The Walking Dead"") is written by Frank Darabont and directed by Chuck Russell (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors) revamps the original's ideas, knocks up the gore, and is an overall extremely entertaining experience.

The story is the same: a meteorite crashes to Earth and houses a gelatinous creature that has no problem eating its way through the population in order to seek world dominance. A great film with some incredible practical effects and plenty of gore to go around, this is a can't miss shocker for any horror fan.

The blu-ray in this review is for the release from the Australian label, Umbrella Entertainment, and once again, it is region free. This film was a limited edition in the U.S.A. under the Twilight Time label and sold out in no time flat (thus spiking the price). So those in the U.S.A, have no fear, I've tested this blu-ray disc on a PS4, Xbox One, and standalone player with no issues playing either the film itself or the special features. Umbrella comes through again (like the 1990 NOTLD remake) in making a ""limited edition"" still available and price friendly for American consumers.

468999,4,630245333X,"Those of you wondering if this Blu-ray distributed by Umbrella Entertainment from Australia will work on U.S. blu ray players, this review is for you. I like many other The Blob fans, was unable or unwilling to buy the limited edition U.S. release Blu ray from Twilight time. That version is going for $90 or more. When I saw this version from Umbrella appear online, I was excited but unsure if it was region free as it seems that info is hard to come by. I went to Umbrella's web site where they have it listed as  Region dash (Region - ) That seemed like they were saying it was region free, but not very clearly. I decided I'd give it a try and ordered it cause it was inexpensive on Amazon. I cancelled my order an hour later cause I saw some other sites stating it was PAL only, or Region B locked being from Australia and they showed the back of the Blu ray where it actually does say Region B. I was bummed. Fast forward a week, and a YouTube reviewer actually did a review on this Umbrella release and finally confirmed that yes, even though it states Region B on the case artwork, it will in fact play on U.S. players. As a matter of fact, he said it was Region Free and will play anywhere but I cannot confirm that myself. I have since ordered this Blu ray, and can confirm it DOES play on my U.S. blu ray player, as well as on my PS4. As for the picture quality, it is very good. Not spectacular, but very good. I never owned the DVD, but this Blu ray is free of film scratches and artifacts but seems a bit grainy. The sharpness is nice though, and the colors really pop. It looked good on my 4k television, and that's good enough I suppose. Extras include an interview with the director and the movie trailer. Hope this helps you fellow fans wanting to buy this movie.",1481673600,93,1782,4.225806451612903
469000,5,630245333X,"man oh man, where do I begin......

Haven't seen this on video for well over 20 years, and ironically enough, this is one of the rare occasions where a remake actually manages to be better than its classic counterpart (another example is John Carpenter's ""The Thing (1982)"" and David Cronenberg's ""The Fly (1986)"").

Not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet or in awhile, but this has some of the most nastiest (and creative) deaths ever onscreen, with one of those deaths that was quite ballsy to pull off, but worked out pretty good.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Steve McQueen version from 1958, but I like the more serious and foreboding tone the 1988 version manages to pull off.

Not to mention, you can't go wrong with the dream-team of Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont, who would later go on to write/direct ""Eraser"", ""The Mist"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and of course, ""The Green Mile"".",1479513600,,915,4.6645962732919255

Practically the only good thing about the remake is that the teen characters are actually played by young actors.

The original had Steve McQueen playing a teenager, but he looks like someone's dad.

The remake screws up almost everything else. One major change is that the blob falls to Earth inside a military satellite instead of a meteor.

They sent some viruses into space and they came back as a giant amoeba? It makes no sense.

Also, the remake uses the same stupid biological weapons angle as the ""Alien"" movies.

The army doesn't need killer organisms. They have nuclear weapons!

It might have been a little better if the blob had been sent into space by another country to wreak havoc in the U.S. but it was an *American* satellite, which is lame.

The bazooka in the manhole sequence is stupid. All the main characters would have died.

Also, the idea that you can freeze the blob with an explosion is ridiculous.

Say you blow up a liquid nitrogen tanker. The liquid nitrogen wouldn't stay cold. It would become regular nitrogen, which is a gas, and float away.",1465776000,,1152,4.658415841584159

469123,5,630245333X,"I love this movie. If you're looking for gore and grue and violence then look no further. The 1988 version of The Blob is all that and more. It is, to me, the perfect example of small town horror. It paints a believable picture of a quiet, middle-American, high school football town that's got that sort of facade of perfection with just a little bit going on under the surface, AND THEN IT DROPS THE BLOB RIGHT IN IT. It's not afraid to be funny, the performances are strong, and the production value feels weirdly high. It's a monster movie that really feels like there was some support behind it.
But all that's just window dressing. Where ""The Blob"" really shines is in Blob-centric carnage and terror. The Blob itself in this movie seems genuinely predatory and intelligent, occasionally giving the impression that it's plotting and trapping and thinking. That's a real testiment to the special effects guys on this thing that they really give the thing personality. It's genuinely cool-looking and gross, yet fascinating. And while I think I prefer the deep purple, raspberry jam color of the original blob, as well as its complete LACK of personality, the sort of sparkly, gooey, fiberglass insulation wad of the remake is undeniably cool.
It effortlessly murders the majority of this small town in such clever, exciting,  and disgusting ways. The movie really explores the full potential of a giant blob that dissolves and absorbs anything it comes across, and you have to appreciate a story that leaves no stone unturned. Like, I just rewatched it and I wanna watch it again. It's the sort of movie that's uses violence and gore perfectly, it's all that you'd imagine it could be and sometimes more.

I hope they put it on Blu Ray soon. I don't know if the Japanese movie The H Men, came before the original Blob, but if it did, it was the original of this concept. I hope H Men is released on Blu Ray also. The monster in H Men, The Blob, and the Remake and Prequel to The Thing, are all very similar, The difference is that in the modern Thing movies the creature replaces you instead of just consuming you.

469286,5,630245333X,"Generally speaking, most remakes of the classic horror & sci-fi films are terrible and one asks why was the remake made in the first place. Some titles that come to mind are Peter Jackson's 'King Kong', Spielburg's 'War Of The Worlds', 'Invaders From Mars', 'Godzilla (any) ad nauseum. Occasionally, a remake is as good (if not better) than the original. (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers' and 'The Thing' come to mind). At any rate, this remake of the 1958 remake of the so-called classic 'The Blob' stands out. The original isn't really that good and Steve McQueen knew it too when he took a 'flat payout inside a percent of the gross (which, financially speaking was a mistake on Steve's part. The movie made a gazillion dollars).
In this version with a screenplay (co-written by Frank Darabont (The Mist, Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Walking Dead) and Chuck Russel (who also directed)) is tight, unpredictable, gross & scary. What surprised me most when I first saw this film was that cast members you LIKED were getting consumed, even an obnoxious 10 year old, technically a no no in movie land (I suspect Darabont had a hand in the kid's demise).
The acting was also pretty good with Shawnee Smith (in her pre 'Saw' saga role) taking over for Steve McQueen, practically becoming a female version of a teen Rambo. Kevin Dillon (Matt's brother) is also good as the disaffected loner who helps save the day although some of his actions at the end of the movie are a bit illogical.
The effects are mixed (extremely good to so-so) with a combination of rod puppets (the most effective in my view), animation & full scale mock ups. Some scenes are truly memorable: Paul (who you thought was going to be the hero) being consumed in the hospital, Shawnee Smith's character trapped in the phone booth and the strobe light effect in the movie theater as hapless patrons are being eaten (a nod to the original although far more graphic).

That being said, we have The Blob (1986), I went into the theater with high hopes of a SFX extravaganza, I was not disappointed, it used aspects of the original in the beginning of the film and then basically took off on it's own from there, the body count was higher, the gore was....ummm gorier.
I became a bit depressed when the government got involved because I wasn't sure which way the movie would turn but felt a sense of relief when the Blob took care of most of the government dudes, which was strange because for awhile, I was rooting for the Blob.
This was a really good remake. I left the movie theater happy with this flick, bought it as soon as I got a DVD Player, along with the original.
Don't miss this one. It will not disappoint.
While this was a review of the DVD, I'll wait for an official release of the blu-ray, I'm not spending almost $100 bucks for a blu-ray, no way, not even for this movie.

At any rate, it's not a major knock on this movie to say, looking back, I think when it was released this is one of those movies that was given way more credit for being edgy and original than it actually was. The special effects don't hold up terrifically well (not it's fault), the acting is more clearly a little shaky (totally it's fault) and there is some storyline that should have been trimmed, particularly with the time we spend on some of the cannon fodder -cough cough- teenagers early on.

The product itself is basic, no frills. Widescreen, anamorphic flick with a few audio streams (no commentaries, just language variants), subs, and the usual trailers (which some might consider ""extras,"" but I don't). That's it. Pretty much a standard ""vanilla"" offering.

Brian Flagg is the anti-hero here, considered a trouble maker and outcast while Shawnee Smith is  Meg a cheerleader, well liked and popular girl. The premise is the same as the original, meteor brings in an alien life form that is found by an old man living in the woods. Circumstances throw them together and they wind up in a hospital where the Blob does what it does best... it eats everything in sight. Meg witnesses the death of her boyfriend but no one believes her. Of course when people start to disappear, Flagg is blamed because he the town bad boy and police knew he was close to the scene. With no evidence he is released. Meg's little brother and his friend go to a movie theater where the Blob finds more people to consume. Here we see the Blob really go to work on the people in the theater, yanking them from their seats and devouring them in glorious color. Meg is no shrinking, screaming, fainting female as she runs in looking for her brother. She manages to get them out of the theater by going through the sewers. Brian having left Meg and her boyfriend at the hospital soon learns that Meg might be in danger and dashes off to find which he does. Of course the movie would not be complete If the government didn't come in trying to capture the creature for their own purpose. The two teen agers decide to take matters into their own hands to destroy the alien/Blob.

The concept of the protoplasmic blob is also well conceived. Grotesque what the blob can do to you you but it also fits the profile of the thing with no shape. A sort of a poor man's Shoggoth.

469439,4,630245333X,"Thirty years after the original ""The Blob"" with Paul Newman we got the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith (Larry Hagman also did a sequel in 1972 called ""Beware! the Blob""). The plot is like the original: A mysterious Jello-like substance from outer space lands on earth and attacks the nearest town, devouring people and growing.

The movie has the vibe of a Stephen King film -- small town, cartoony characters and a monster of some sort that threatens the town -- sort of like ""Christine"", ""Silver Bullet"", ""The Tommyknockers"", ""Needful Things"" and a gazillion others. It's also reminiscent of the 80's Friday the 13th flicks. So, if you like Stephen King and the Friday the 13th films, you'll probably like this one.

As the delinquent teen, Kevin Dillon (in a quasi-mullet, lol) is a surprisingly effective protagonist and Shawnee Smith is too; she plays the popular cheerleader who hesitantly seeks the delinquent's assistance. If you're not familiar with Shawnee, she went on to play the ditzy brunette Linda on ""Becker"". Anyway, it's cool seeing her as a teenager here.

In some ways this remake is better than the original. It's in color, it has better F/X (naturally) and a few scenes are much more explicit and horrifying than the original. Two examples jump to mind: When the girl's boyfriend, Paul, buys the farm early on it's one of the greatest horror scenes in cinematic history, no kidding. There's another semi-shocking scene where someone we don't expect to die is hideously consumed by the creature (in the sewers). Speaking of which, one of the movie's strengths is that people you wouldn't expect to die do.

But it's less effective in that it sometimes cops a semi-parody vibe, like when the cook at the diner is yanked upside down into a sink by the creature or when Erika Eleniak (in a too-brief role) buys the farm playing some kid's hot date. I couldn't help busting out laughing at these scenes and a couple of others. Were the filmmaker's intentionally shooting for camp here? I think so.

So it's a weird mix, switching from utter horror to amusing non-horror. The addition of a subplot that reveals the creature's origins as decidedly earth-centric takes away from the Blob's otherworldly and scary ambiance in the original. As such, it's not as effective as the original, at least as a serious horror film where less is more, but it IS just as entertaining and maybe more so.

Interestingly, the story takes place in a California ski town (notice the snow-making vehicle), but the film was shot in Abbeville, Louisiana, which is hardly known for skiing. The long shots of the town with mountains in the background are obviously not Abbeville and are presumably of a California town.

BOTTOM LINE: This is an entertaining 80's remake of ""The Blob"" that strangely bombed at the box office. It shouldn't have as it's on par with the better Stephen King and Friday the 13th flicks of that era.

The film runs 95 minutes.

Besides it is good to watch the classic movies where there was an actual plot and less blood and gore. The movies today have more special effects then they do have real acting.",1381449600,,296,4.5
469442,4,630245333X,"Remakes either work or fall flat on their faces; no matter what our thoughts are on these, it's inevitable they'll keep coming. We can stand in line and picket Hollywood, we can sign internet petitions that they become so long they would be a fortune to print out, we can send letters, rave on websites, rant on instant messenger...but to no avail. For remakes, much like cheesy science fiction fare, will always live on.

In the 80's this mindset was as strong as ever, particularly since previous science fiction/horror flicks had been redone and with success. Chuck Russell took on the project of readapting the 50's version of the blob, a tale of alien goo coming from outer space and being discovered in a small town, where it promptly begins to devour people. The more nutritious humans it digests, the bigger the blob grows, and the harder it is to kill. This story is identical in its basic theme, with some small changes to adapt to modern audiences. (What else would be the point? Hello Psycho!)

Here we have the standard boy and girl, 'hot and heavy' and 'young in love.' They're the 'eager beavers' of the story, trying desperately to convince all adults that the teenagers are telling the truth when they exclaim a giant blob has come to eat them all and take over the world. In the original version the teenage boy and girl were more innocent, clich, and goody two shoes (in other words, sickening). Here they are more 'current' except for the 80's way of overdoing things. Unfortunately once this movie was given an update, it also adopted the tacky as hell dialogue and - yes, folks, it's inevitable isn't it? - one liners. These still cliche teens are a bit different in personality, but propelled forward with the same ol' motivations.

Fortunately with the remake comes more eye candy. At least another bucket of blood coats this film reel, with the blob being a bigger, badder, and generally cooler beastie than before. We even get the delight of seeing the cytoplastic chomper ingest his victims and literally dissolve them inside its hideous, transparent being. Sometimes the victims are still living, making it that much more horrifying and uber-cool. The telephone booth scene illustrated this the best. Effects in this area are great and dare to cross the MPAA no-no line to give us the juicy stuff.

Also, as it known for current horror, the pace has picked up. Not only does the blob roll faster, the scenes do as well. It's a bit like comparing Romero's Dawn of the Dead Zombies to the remakes. Instead of rumbling and gooing along it's in your face faster than you can blink. It even does the quick jump scares that would make one of the holy three slashers jealous. Action has been pumped up in a major way, and even if you find the whole thing rather silly (which is the point, anyway), you'll likely not get bored.

Direction is pretty right, emphasizing that the blob can literally be everywhere and strike when it chooses. The scenes at the docs and the food place are particularly thrilling. It's never bad to see a blob break through glass or suck someone through a sink drain is it? The deaths are inventive for a killer of this style, and they laid on enough special effects to have it work. Admittedly the lower budget film did have its flaws with some of the blob effects - as the size grows the realism diminishes. This can be ignored, however, considering the source. After all, we don't go into movies of this style with serious mindsets and analytical outlooks, now do we?

Another notable difference between the two blobs is a bit of social commentary. In the orginal the teens weren't believed until the town saw before their very eyes the devious, diabolical diner for themselves. As a result the people flocked together like a pack of wolves to devour their prey and conquered the alien once and for all. Here, though, we get introduced to - du du dum! - another favorite and all too familiar science cliche. The evil adult governmental agency conspiracies! What fun! And what would this be without the well known evil doctor figure? It could be said that the take back then was that society flocked together in the face of the enemy and reigned as triumphant by getting high from team effort, while in modern times its an all for yourself and all for one show. I do doubt, though, that times have changed that much - man has always just generally stunk. Perhaps the ""ooh, there's something cool over there, let's take over it and use it to our advantage"" train of thought is more realistic and always has been, no matter what the decade.

Which will you prefer more? Hard to say. It's not easy to recapture the magic of a 50's flick like this one where it's still able to keep its oozing charm. When the movie was remade, some of the magic was left behind. The blob has certainly wore thin by the decade. It's idea and general premise worked better in a different time and for a different audience.  However, it was nice to revisit a classic tale as well, with some modern fine tuning and nifty special effects. If you wish to ignore the characters horrid dialogue, then this movie should suit you just fine. It holds power over the original in a few spots, but the safest bet is just to keep an eye on them both. You never know when they'll grow out of hand.",1379635200,,5309,4.5928270042194095

The ending was cool & creepy. During a tent-meeting church service in a field,Meeker disfigured by his burn injuries, is preaching a doomsday sermon sounding like the Blob's attack. He is asked by a woman about when the time of reckoning will come, Meeker replies ""Soon... Madame... soon... the Lord will give me a sign."" and holds up a glass jar containing a fragment of the Blob, which moves. This is a really terrific film one of the greatest films from the 1980s.

Oh well, you can't have everything. Still, the effects of this movie make it worth watching. The cover shows what Shawnee Smith (Meg) runs into when she attempts to assist her boyfriend.

THE BLOB is reborn using state-of-the-art special effects in the 1988 remake, one of the better Science Fiction films to be remade in the 80's following John Carpenter's THE THING. Chuck Russell molds the updated screenplay around germ warfare and Reagan Era politics at the close of the Cold War. The drama unfolds like a bad episode of 90210 for the predominantly teen cast, but that really isn't what the film is about here. It is about melting as many people as possible into slimy goo, and no film does it better than THE BLOB! Several of the most graphic and shockingly unexpected death scenes from the 1980's come out of THE BLOB, and no one is safe when the creature consumes men, women, AND children! We watch as people are liquified on screen, with their arms and faces dripping off from the creature's acidic jelly. The Blob was brought to life by a young Tony Gardner using an array of inventive practical and visual effects that hold up considerably well even decades after its release. THE BLOB is a good old-fashioned monster movie that has been bloodied up for modern audiences, and it sure is fun to watch!

469513,5,630245333X,"I'm almost ashamed to admit I like this version better than the original.  This Blob is a bit more aggressive and as such, the suspense jumps a notch or two above the first.  You actually get to see the results of being overtaken by the Blob.  Fear of the unknown is one thing, but seeing the results of what something can do leaves no doubt.  In the first film, the Blob looked like a dab of strawberry jam on the loose.  This Blob isn't afraid to show how it absorbs people.  It's also easier to believe the ""kids"" starring in this version are kids (or thereabouts) as opposed to the middle-aged teens in the first offering.  I also love that this film opens with the suggestion that the city is already a ghost town, devoid of people.  There's just more to consider in this version than the first.

I always watch these two films as a double feature, never one, or the other.
It's like the Blob came back with his older brother and he's going to beat the crap out of you.",1359590400,,974,4.278688524590164
469514,4,630245333X,"This movie really shocked me by how good it was. I recently re-watched the original Blob movie starring Steve McQueen and was surprised by how hokey it was. Sure it was made on a shoestring budget back in the 50's, but I remembered seeing it as a kid and thinking it was amazing. I then re-watched the remake and was pleasantly surprised by how well it held up. The effects are a little dated and some of the plot points are sort of goofy, but it's still a solid flick. I can name maybe a handful of remake/reboots that manage to even be on the same level let alone surpass the original. This movie is up near the top of that list.
The story is almost the same as the original. Meteorite lands in small town, man eating alien goo oozes out of said meteorite, several people wind up being devoured by rampaging goo, band of teenagers try to organize townsfolk to fight back against alien menace. There is one notable exception though. There is an explanation about what the Blob really is. Sometimes over explaining a monster takes away from the scare factor, but this time it worked well in the context of the story. It opened a new avenue for the story to go in and essentially created way more hapless victims for the ravenous slime to consume.
The 1988 version of the Blob also breaks several horror movie rules. Little kids get eaten, priests get their faces melted, and it's not the wholesome all American high school quarterback who saves the day but the dirtbag juvenile delinquent that nobody even likes . One other thing that really makes the new Blob a great horror movie is that you actually get to see the Blob kill people, and it is a messy thing to behold. The special effects are still amazingly good for an 80's era movie. Some of the green screen shots are a little goofy looking, but you'll barely notice. Along with the impressive effects are some solid performances by the lovely Shawnee Smith who later went on to star in the Saw movies and Kevin Dillon who went on to become Johnny Drama on Entourage. Both lend believability to their roles and have strong character arcs throughout the film.
If you're curious about the Blob movies and haven't seen them yet, I'd suggest seeing the remake first and if you like it check out the 50's classic to see where it all started.",1356825600,,2292,4.485645933014354

The blob"" is a remake with a satellite returning with a blob that eats anything and grows huge. I didn't like the fact that u.s. military was behind the blob and the lead villian was a scientist instead of the blob. It's not needed but the overall story is a good one in spite of this. The dvd picture is pretty good too. This one should hit blu ray hopefully someday as it was a A movie with alot of money behind it. And the effects are actually better than if they used cgi overkill , which they do on too many movies these days. Kevin Dillon is a good lead in this one and the rest of the cast does a fine job too.

The remake of this science fiction thriller, The Blob (1988) retains the basic outline of the original story, while updating it for the times, and featuring some impressive special effects and gore.  With some gross-out comedy elements, the remake is a fun time, delivering some decent thrills and a few laughs, with teenage kids again as the main characters.

A meteor impacts in southern California, near the town of Arborville.  An old man living in the woods, is investigating the crash site, when a strange substance gets on his hand and begins to interact with his flesh.  High school student Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) is driving through the woods with his date Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith), when he accidentally hits the old man, who is apparently being chased by Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon), a classmate with a reputation for getting in trouble.

The three kids take the injured man to the hospital, after which Brian leaves.  While being treated, the man is partially consumed, as a blob-like creature is released.  This creature then absorbs Paul, in front of a shocked Meg, and exits the hospital.  The police discount her story about a monster, so Meg seeks out Brian, who is eating at a diner.  Meanwhile, the creature has entered the sewer system, and just happens to show up at the same diner for a late night snack.  Hiding in a walk-in freezer, Meg and Brian manage to survive, as the creature has an aversion to cold.  Eventually they end up at the meteor crash site, and are taken into custody by a government containment team, led by Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca), who turns out to be your typical mad scientist type.

With the basic players established, the story continues incorporating elements from the original story, like the Blob's appearance at a theater while a movie is playing.  The blob then oozes back into the sewer system, pursuing Meg and her brother.  The finish is pretty original, as some of the residents have barricaded themselves inside a church.  Brian arrives on the scene driving a snow making truck, to try and stop the creature, however things don't go very smoothly, and only Meg's quick action helps to avert disaster.

There isn't a lot of suspense or sheer terror, but director and co-writer Charles Russell's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamscape/dp/B0006Z2KFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamscape</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraser/dp/0790729601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraser</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-3-Dream-Warriors/dp/0780630866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors</a>) remake, is definitely an enjoyable and entertaining ride.

The acting performances by nearly everyone, are excellent for a movie in this genre.  The teenagers played by Dillon and Smith, are intelligent, resourceful, and brave.  You can totally get behind these characters.  There are some occasional missteps, but for the most part this is close to perfection, for a sci-fi B-movie told in a traditional 1950's style.

Directed by Chuck Russell, who co-wrote this Blob remake with Frank Darabont, 1988's ""The Blob"" is one of the many great horror films to come out of the 80's for fans of horror/sci-fi films beyond just the popular slasher genre. The cast, headed up by Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith, is mostly great. Shawnee's acting seems rather bland at times, but she never looked better.

This remake of the original 50's classic makes the best effort to re-invent the story of a meteorite that carries a deadly alien life form...or so it seems. This time around we have Shawnee Smith as the lead protagonist (best known from Saw franchise) her role in this film is as great as it is in the saw movies, she presents a typical teenager, but with a little bit of attitude. Along are other forgotten 80's stars.

I have to admit that the plot may be in certain ways similar to that of the original, but the Chuck Russell (Director) brings new gimmicks and frights to what you may think can be your typical cheesy horror flick. I myself was surprised by some of the moments were I jumped in the movie. The effects are also impressive, even though by today's standards they are outdated, there are still are alot of impressive mechanical effects that are not seen much nowadays.

Personally this is a rare remake that's superior to the original. It's almost up to par with David Cronenberg's The Fly. I personally would buy it, its slick, funny, and of course slimy lol.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought these thoughts watching this film. But this is what makes for good horror.

Most scenes are a result of reverse filming, forward projection work and matt screening as well as latex modeling: Well done for the most part, but with some minor flaws in the effects and story line.

Given the paranoia of the pestulance that hit the earth, starting 1981; first with AIDS, then ebola, and many other unheard of pathogens before that time, this film, I think, best expresses the darkness, fear and death scenario of the time as our world became overwhelmed with plagues.

The death scenes in this are grizzly to say the least; with no respect given to life at all, thus adding to the suspense value. Except for some minor plot and effects flaws, I gave it four stars when it comes to addressing the subject of horror.

It's been 20 years since this remake was made. I figure we are all due for a new remake from Hollywood, using today's computer graphics any time soon. Won't that be a treat?!

So, the plot, A meteor (or is it!)crashes to earth jellylike goo busts out of so called meteor, this goo slithers through anything and attaches itself to humans devouring these humans and getting bigger and bigger.  A loner rebel (Or is he!) named Brian Flagg (Almost as scary as the blob is his mullet) played by Kevin Dillon (entourage, platoon) teams up with hot cheerleader Meg Penny to lead the fight against the BLOB!
This movie also wasn't as predictable as i thought *SPOILER ALERT*, earlier in the movie a nice waitress Fran gets asked out by equally nice and fair  Sheriff Herb Geller.  Fran declines cause she has to work , but wait leaves a note on the check ""i get out at 11"" oooh i can't wait.  So this is the making of something beautiful right, nope the blob squashes Fran in a telephone booth, and guess who she sees right before this squashing Sheriff Herb, does he blow a kiss goodbye?  Negative he is up in the blob that is about to devour her.  At least they do become one.
Even before Meg Penny goes on her date with responsible and likeable Paul.  He meets her dad and her mom, he's an established character from the beginning, so he makes it right? Wrong again, blob food.  I knew he was a goner when at the hospital rebel loner Brian Flagg shows his soft side to the bumb and Meg was swooning, it was all over for football player Paul Taylor at that point.

Quite an awesome remake of the 50's sci-fi/horror classic with Steve Mcqueen that is just as good but with a new explanation on the creature's origin as it's a government experiment from space gone wrong. The acting is very good and so are the nifty special effects and gory detailed scenes of people being engulfed by the slime especially the memorable man being sucked down the sink scene, the blob itself is more nastier and meaner looking then the original glob of strawberry jam.

After a highly entertaining introduction to the main players, an object from outer space crashes down in a field near a hobo's shack. The hobo goes to investigate and ends up with blob goo wrapped around his hand. Some local teenagers take him to a hospital and that's when all Hell breaks loose. Before you can say ""Hockey season ended months ago."" the blob has grown bigger than Rosie O'Donnell's skull and starts killing everybody in town. Not to worry though, because Kevin Dillon and his trusty motorcycle are here to save the day...except for the few dozen people who get killed by the blob including some really awesome kills like a dude pulled down a sink drain and a woman crushed inside a phone booth.

Everything that was awesome about 50's creature feature movies is in this movie and then amplified with pure 80's cheese. It's a blast!

Running Time:  95 minutes

Rated R for violence, gore, and language.

""The Blob"", a glorified, special-effects injected remake of the 1950's classic, opens to the eerie and totally deserted streets of a small American town called Arborville with everyone attending the big game. One of the football players Paul Taylor (Donovan Leitch) asks an attractive cheerleader out named Meg Penny (Shawnee Smith). That night an old man (Billy Beck) who lives out in some woods near Arborville sees a flaming meteorite land nearby. He investigates, he sees a purple jelly substance moving around inside. He unwisely decides to poke it with a stick. The purple jelly slides along the stick and attachs itself to his hand. The towns local petty criminal Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon) is repairing his bike when the old man jumps out from behind some tress at him and tries to cut his own hand off with an axe. The man disappears into the woods, Flagg runs after him. Paul and Meg are on their date when the old man runs out in front of their car and is hit. Paul and Meg take the old man and Flagg to the local hospital. Before long the old man has been more or less completely eaten by the blob and decides Paul looks tasty as well. The blob is loose, it's growing at an extraordinary rate and will eat anything or anyone that moves! The local police, Sheriff Herb Gellar (Jeffrey DeMunn) and his deputy Bill Briggs (Paul McCrane) don't believe a word of their story to begin with, but as the population of Arborvile rapidly decreases they have a race against time to stop the blob before it eats the entire town and possibly the whole of nation. Soon after, Government agents turn up, lead by the sinister Dr. Meddows (Joe Seneca) and Colonel Hargis (Jack Rader), and it soon becomes clear that they aren't the towns saviours as they at first appeared to be.

The special effects are often silly, but nevertheless very effective, with sequences that are very imaginative and take advantage of the 80's style humur that make that decade's horror films what they are.  The acting, as you would expect, is nothing to write home about; but the cast approach their roles with gusto, and the fun performances help to make the film what it is. Kevin Dillon as the reluctant hero and Shawnee Smith as the only living witness to what's behind all of this are likable in their roles, and pleasingly, the story gives the latter's character a lot more fire and guts than you'd imagine a the role of a cheerleader to have. Dillon's character is your regular badboy turned good, but he plays it well, despite his shocking mullet! A diverting subplot involving the origins of the blob adds a good twist near the end, and there's a creepy ending that hints at the possibility of a sequel. Chuck Russell does a great job of creating the right sort of atmosphere for the film and the screenplay is better than you would expect for a trashy eighties horror flick.  Overall, an entertaining remake that will undoubtedly satisfy those who love cheesy horror flicks or who just enjoy watching good, hokey fun, no matter the genre.",1135900800,12,3263,4.708771929824562

469769,5,630245333X,"I thought maybe this was going to be another B-movie remake of a classic with lame affects since it was the eighties. I was extremely surprised to see how real everything looked. the special effects were incredible considering it was somewhat low-bugdet. The underrated actors played good rolls too, especially Shawnee Smith. Donovan Leitch, brief but efficient.

When a strange, and mysterious comet suddenly crashes to earth in the outskirts of the small quiet town of Arborville, only four seemingly innocent people have witnessed the scene. When two of them suddenly disappear without a trace, and even more residents of aborville do too, the people who are left know something has to be wrong.

Witnesses claim that the meteor that came to earth produced a strange gel substance that sticks to anything it touches. The blob like thing has also been seen devouring people by absorbing, and melting them. As the blob gets bigger, the population of the town gets smaller, and things get even stranger though. Before anyone even knows what's going on, a shadowy organazation group made up of scientists has been investigating the site where the thing crashed. As the scientists grow even more interested, the Blob grows even bigger, and nothing in it's path will stop it.

I have to say that all the versions of the blob had pretty good special effects for their time. The first was good for thrills, the sequel to the first was good for laughs, and the last one was made for extreme gross outs, and scares. Just make sure no one under the age of 11 sees this version. I saw this when I was merely ten because of the fact that I had seen the original and was interested in the remake. There's a scene where the underrated Donovan Leitch gets devoured by the blob (a very subtle image of it on the front cover compared to what really happened in the movie) and it devistated me for life.

As a result, I only saw it one other time, and that was when I was eleven. Not much a difference in the scares, but for about a year, I had to sleep with a blanket over my head to make sure the blob wasn't going to ooze out on top of me. I'm 14 now, but I'm not really sure I want to take the risk of seeing it again. Those nightmares can be pretty scary. The movies still very vivid to me anyway. Make sure to sleep with your fire extinguisher after watching this movie. You'll need it.",1106524800,2,2376,4.505800464037123
469770,5,630245333X,"The Blob was an entertaining, yet eventually campy classic.  The limited tools for special effects dampered the original but the story and idea was there.  Flash forward nearly 30 years later and the folks in hollywood decide to take another crack at it.  The result is an entertaining, frightening horror film that feeds to a certain extent on the strength of special effects, but also claustrophobia as well.

The story is that a meteorite has crashed landed on earth near a small town.  An organizm on the metorite gets loose and attaches itself to a bum passing through.  As it slowly eats him it begins to grow and as it grows it starts to eat, preferably people.  Eventually it comes down to (you'll love this) a cheerleader and a local rebel to stop it.

The reason this movie is great is for numerouse reasons.  First the movie realizes that it is campy, and uses it to it's advantage.  It also takes pop culture of that time (1980's) and pokes fun at it.  Case in point is that Slasher films were big then, so what do they do?  They make a scene with a crowded audience watching a really bad slasher film featuring a gardener in a hockey mask using a motorized Hedge Trimmer.

The one other area I like about this is the feeling that no one is safe as is demonstrated when a young boy gets absorbed and dissolved by the blob.

With self-effacing in-jokes, clever shocks, and superb effects, it delivers the goods in the form of a genuinely scary film that's eager to have fun with its B-movie premise.

469773,5,630245333X,"Let's not compare Chuck Russell's ""revisiting"" of the classic 1958 movie which was one of Steve McQueen's first starring roles.  Thirty years of cinematic improvements make a comparison wholly unnecessary and unfair.  THE BLOB, as envisioned by Chuck Russell (Eraser), is a scifi gorefest, with some imaginative effects and its own brand of intense mayhem.
A meteor crashes to earth near a small ski-resort town.  The kindly old ""can man"" finds the crash site, and plays around with some messy looking stuff oozing from the meteor.  This stuff is actually some kind of viral mess that absorbs and spreads like wildfire.  One of the main differences in the two movies is that in this version, is the monster from outer space, or...ha, no spoilers.  Suffice to say, things are not what they seem.
The cast is a mixture of good performers and adequate ones.  Good:  Jeffrey DeMunn as the sheriff who has the hots for the town's kindly restaurant owner, played with youthful elegance by Candy Clark (American Graffiti).  Also good:  Art LaFleur as the pharmacist and papa to heroine Shawnee Smith (merely adequate).  Kevin Dillon swaggers like a James Dean wannabe but matures as the picture moves on and he becomes a likely and likeable hero.  Joe Seneca as the mysterious doctor is surprisingly effective in a villainous role for a change, and Donovan Leitch in his little screen time evokes a rare mature teenager.  The scene in the pharmacy where a friend of Leitch's purchases condoms is pretty funny.  As for the horror scenes, they're good:  the blob in the restaurant wherein the cook goes down the drain; the stampede in the movie theater when the blob takes center stage; and the finale with the snow machine.  All well done and effective.  Compared to a lot of really bad horror movies currently going straight to DVD, THE BLOB is a cut above the rest, and remember, there's always rooms for jello!!!",1088812800,2,1907,4.854489164086687

You see, this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] ""classic"" is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.
The plot is almost as absurd as the title, following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town, munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance.  Cue face melting, blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.
The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie, and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable, but as i already mentioned, this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film.",1082937600,3,762,4.5661764705882355
469776,4,630245333X,"Chuck Russell's 1988 version of the classic horror film THE BLOB is really less a remake and more what is nowadays called a ""re-imagining.""  Both films have the same fundamental plot: Gelatinous hunk of sentient goop piggybacks to Earth on a meteor, then proceeds to eat--or, more accurately, dissolve and absorb--every living creature it encounters, while in the mean time, two in-the-know teenagers try to warn the incredulous populace of a nearby rural town.  The original 1958 production, starring a young Steve McQueen, is a satire of 1950s white-bread conservatism, as well as a tongue-in-cheek parody of that decade's popular sci-fi and horror films.  The more recent film, on the other hand, is basically straight-on horror, and fans of the older film should therefore not delve into the newer one with the hopes of finding that familiar gee-whiz tone--it just ain't there.
As a basic '80s horror flick, however, the 1988 incarnation of THE BLOB is actually quite good.  The story is fairly tight and gripping, and there aren't too many noticeable plot holes.  The two principal characters are, in contrast to the original, earnest and fairly accurate depictions of teens from the film's era, and the two actors portraying them--Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith--are decidedly adequate for the task.  There is, of course, more blood and guts in this film than in the original, with several shots peering into the insides of the translucent monster as its human meals dissolve in potently acidic digestive juices.  And though the amorphous lump of goo here bears a stronger resemblance to Jell-O than to its hip 1950s predecessor--yes, Steve McQueen's globular extraterrestrial nemesis actually looks pretty cool, despite the stop-motion technique used to animate it--the special FX in this film are very well done and quite realistic, and the aforementioned ""digestion"" scenes will definitely delight gore hounds.
Although there is no doubt that Chuck Russell's 1988 ""re-imagining"" of THE BLOB is built on the dusty foundation of the first, making a qualitative comparison of the two is really unjustified, as each filmmaker created their work with different ends in mind.  As mentioned before, the 1958 film presents a satirical and parodic look at the decade in which it was made, whereas the 1988 film offers up straightforward scares, thrills, and chills.  Consequently, each film will evoke a different response from the audience--one a smirk, the other gooseflesh.  So although the 1988 version does not have the multi-layered subtext of the film that came before it, it certainly is a generator of goose bumps aplenty, and as such, it is just as successful--if not just as ""good""--as the original.
The Columbia/Tristar DVD edition of 1988's THE BLOB offers a crisp widescreen digital transfer at a very reasonable price, so even those who find they like this version but still prefer the original can afford to have BOTH versions in their collections.",1074124800,,2964,5.182008368200837

If you're looking for a killer script...well, this just may be that ""killer"" script you're looking for. What THE BLOB definately does have is some fantastic special effects, great shocking moments and one slimmy-mean BLOB.
When THE BLOB captures its prey, it is frightening. Not to mention, creepy and graphic(and I mean it is graphic to the bone). I'm not crazy about some of the clay-mation effects. Thankfully there isn't many of these scenes. Sadly, some of the acting is poor. At times, it just seemed rushed or possibly the director didn't want to shoot some of the scenes over and try to get a better take. However, I'd say there's more ""good"" acting then bad. Maybe it's just an '80's thing? What really drew me in was how intense THE BLOB scenes were. There's a very good character build-up and when someone got killed...I felt it. Many kudos for that. I hate it when a horror flick just kicks right in and starts killing people. Those kind of movies have no emotional tie and really all you're doing is watching a blood-fest.

Stock characters you know and secretly love, like Candy Clark as the Diner Waitress who Acts Tough but has a Heart of Gold, especially when it comes to the amorous local sheriff, the Football Hero who is a little bit of a snob, the Misunderstood Motorcycle Punk with a crush on the heroine who looks tough and all in his leather jacket but is Smarter than he Looks, the Priest who is a Closet Drunk and preaches Hellfire and Damnation and nbllows things like ""This was all foretold in the book of Revelations!"" when the Blob slithers around main street, stuffing people into itself.

I'm not saying it?s the best horror film of the 80's, (that title would go to....OK, can I pick ten instead of five?

As I said before, it borrows from The Thing remake, but I think not so much as a rip-off but ina admiration for the film. Sure it?s not John Carpenter?s The Thing, but then again, what is? In fact, if you're fan of The Thing but need a break somewhere between your 10th and 20th viewing, definitely plop this one in and ge your fix.

My two cents--pick up this fun, underrated popcorn flick monster movie and get ready to have a good time. And if you don?t?

Just look at the cover to see the kind of carnage you will be seeing in this film. The acting is more than passable for this type of movie, and the comedy is all intentional and kept to a minimum.
Russel clearly understands why the blob is so frightening a villain, and he exploits that in gruesome, wrenching horror scenes were characters are entangled and being digested inside of it. The scares are all real and visual based. They aren't cheap jump-out-and-go-boo scares, but legitimate, visceral thrills. The music isn't brash shrieking notes just to jolt you, but subdued and suspenseful.
Unless you don't find anything in horror movies frightening, this is a horror movie you SHOULD SEE. I'm only 17 so I have no nostalgic attatchments to the lame original.
For a MONSTER movie that is frightening, not cheap, thrilling, and visceral, THE BLOB is THE movie to get",1059436800,,1028,4.780898876404494
469849,4,630245333X,"I really enjoyed this remake.  I love the original, and I think a good job was done staying true to the original, while managing to update it for a new generation.  I've seen a lot of remakes, and very often you get a sense like the director is trying to avoid ties to the original movie, but not here.
I thought this movie was fast paced and fun.  It kept me interested all the way through.  It was quite violent at times, and gory, but when your subject matter is about an all consuming space blob, you sort of expect that kind of thing.
The interaction between the characters was pretty well done.  Kevin Dillon plays Brain Flagg, our hero who is also an outcast due to his rebellious nature.  Shawnee Smith plays the female lead, the all American cheerleader homecoming queen type.  The two are thrown together to fight the blob.
This version starts off essentially the same as the original, the blob arriving from space and attacking an old man in the woods.  The old man is found by the teenagers, and is taken to the hospital, where it proceeds to consume some characters.  Brian Flagg is initially suspected by the police, as he's no stranger to them, but they have no physical evidence to hold him, so they have to let him go.  Soon, people in this small town start disappearing, and the police have their hands full.  Brian and Meg are the only two who have some idea what's going on, but when Meg tries to relate her story, what she saw, no one really believes her, and Brian isn't very credible, due to the reputation he has with the town in general.
Soon, the blob starts making itself known, consuming many people.  Some kind of government agency shows up, and seals the town with the purpose of capturing the voracious organism.  Facts about the origin of the blob come to light, and it seems the government agency has a larger agenda than they originally stated.  I thought it was quite funny how a number of people would fire at the blob with pistols and automatic weapons, only to find it had no effect on the creature.  There were some pretty horrific scenes with people getting consumed by the blob, showing them basically dissolving as if bathed in acid.  One scene in particular was when a ten or twelve year old boy gets taken.  I was surprised to see this happen, as it's seems pretty rare to me that kids get hurt or killed in these monster movies.  I did see this when it came out, which was like 15 years ago, but I didn't remember that part.  I didn't mind so much, as the kid was pretty annoying.  There's a climatic battle at the end, and the teenagers save the day, but in the last scene we are left wondering if the horror is truly over.
The main differences between this movie and the 1958 version are the effects and the level of violence.  In the 1958 version, the violence was more implied, where this version expands on that, showing us many people being consumed.  Also, the teenagers in this movie can really pass themselves off as teenagers, while in the 1958 version, Steve McQueen and his colleagues seemed a little older than was suggested.  Also, some interesting plot elements are added which suggest the creature may not have originated from space, but here on Earth.  Also, the special effects are weel done, and show us more of what we didn't see in the 1958 version.
I think the 1958 version, which I also own, is and always will be a classic, and this makes a nice companion and is a good movie in it's own right.

I say this because  a movie in the ""reissue phase"" of livelihood will oftentimes find itself with a facelift that will make it a totally different piece for its predecessor, wearing not only a newer cast and script changes but also a new budget and effects to do the idea justice. This, in turn, opens something outdated to an audience that would be turned off to a colorless feature offering inside jokes to a generation they don't understand, granting them insight to ideas that would otherwise find themselves lost and that might help turn a viewer on to the idea of seeing a classical rendition of something because of a remade influence.
Such is the case in this reissuance of The Blob; a movie that keeps the namesake of something from an earlier era in film when graphic depictions of the horrific and the monstrous themes that empower the needy mind weren't actual allowed - without adopting its stance. In fact, I found it particularly chilling in some instances as bodies were dissolved inside that reddish-hued monstrosity and as some people met their fates in terrible fashions; an idea that slips well beyond the realm of the campy original and into the glamorous world of the terrible. In it, some people find themselves folded, some crushed beneath waves of gel, and others seem to take the Nestea Plunge into waters hungry with acidic undertones and appetites that make special effects fun. To me, that is what makes this film stand apart from its former titlebearer.
The premise of the movie involves a meteorite falling in the woods and someone being around to see it. Drunk and clearly ignorant of the dangers that all movie meteorites keep in their possession, our ""patient zero"" opts to prod at it with a stick until something comes oozing out. Further deciding that a stick would be the best offense to feed curiosity, he finds himself manacled in the lovely embrace of something horrifyingly delicious. Enter the town's local badboy, his need to play and subsequently wreck his motorcycle throwing him directly into contact with this drunken miser and with his attempts to remedy the invasive organism's attempt to claim his hand by trying to hack it off; a plan that doesn't hold much in the way of reasoning. This leads to a run toward a nearby road, the introduction of two more of a vast array of characters, and the carting of our friendly organism to the feeding ground called civilization. That's when the real fun and subsequent government intervention begins.
For anyone that likes movies with the dying always in earshot of their otherworldly hero (or menace, if that's how you see it), a storyline that can make one laugh at its bumbling and at its surprise ending, and that is saturated in gruesome spectacles, then this edition of The Blob is for you.

 The film's not just an update to the 1958 version of The Blob, it's more of a different turn on the story. We're taken to a small town where basically everyone knows everyone. It's your average day Mayberry type deal. We're introduced to many residents of the town, but the two main ones are the star cheerleader (Shawnee Smith as Meg Penny) and the town rebel (Kevin Dillon as Brian Flagg). When the two cross paths as a result of some of the blob's terror, we follow these two as they fight for their town and for their lives.
 The Blob has a pretty equal formula for a great, fun horror movie. Of course for any horror movie, there's got to be tense scenes. The film has it's share of some. Most noteable are the whole diner / diner lady chase scene, and the oh-too-great theatre / sewer chase scene. Those two scenes are basically the whole movie, but they make for great viewing! Not only for the intensity, but for the great shooting and colorizations that are there. And the gore? Aw man, the gore is plentiful here. We get gooey body parts, the blob engulfing and then melting body parts off, and more of the gooey melted body parts. It's crazy. Yet not totally overdone. If I dare say, ""tastefully"" done to please any gore fiend. As usual, for any horror movie, we get cliched characters, but they are all handled well here. Shawnee Smith is wonderful as the heroine. She kicked major [behind] here. Kevin Dillon is kind of stale at some times in the movie, but he pulls through and makes a viewer happy. The supporting cast have their own little perks.

Writer/director Chuck Russell (who co-wrote this with The Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont) is an obvious fan of fifties horror, this movie being one on 80s cinema steroids.
