The bands keep me stabilized while  doing the exercises & the pace is good, not too fast.  I can say that this is a workout I can recommend.  In-fact Steffanie has an SI Joint Therapy dvd that I just purchased; so I will review that after I do that.",1475884800,,381,3.960526315789474
8205272,5,B000SFK0CU,"I was recommended this video by a friend, who has hundreds of workout videos. I was looking for something good for beginners to help me regain flexibility and tone up. It is good for a beginner and will keep my interest as I advance! As someone who has a huge fear of the gym I thought a video would encourage me to get back into exercising.

Steffanie is really friendly and a great presenter, talking you through each stage. It is also great fun and I love the music - totally kept me going!

So I would highly recommend this video for anyone looking to get fit in the comfort of their own home - it has definitely worked for me.",1292371200,2,631,4.206611570247934
8205273,5,B000SFK0CU,"I'm not a flexible person, but this looked like a good way into resistance band workout.

It uses gentle, flowing moves and I was able to go at my own pace, varying the resistance by moving my hands on the band. I definitely was stretching and using muscles that I ordinarily don't. And after only a few sessions am noticing improvement in flexibility. I am not as tight as I was before.

The video looks very gentle, but I find myself winded by the end.

I'd recommend this for any beginner. Just remember to keep a towel under your head or rear end as you do.",1277164800,4,561,4.273584905660377
