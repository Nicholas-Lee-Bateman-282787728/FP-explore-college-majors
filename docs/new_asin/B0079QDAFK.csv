5070117,5,B0079QDAFK,"Joy is an excellent trainer and her dvds are awesome. They are great for anyone who wants to get in and stay in shape before pregnancy, during pregnancy and after or if you just want to get a great workout. You will not be disappointed at all. I give this 10 stars!!",1329350400,3,266,4.134615384615385
5070118,5,B0079QDAFK,I am 30 weeks pregnant and have been lucky enough to train with Joy twice a week for the past three years.  Last night was my first work out with the Body by Trimester.  I loved it.  I loved it soo much I made time for a morning workout before work this morning. This video should be a gift that every pregnant girl gets!,1329350400,5,321,3.984375
5070119,5,B0079QDAFK,"I have been working out with Joy for over six weeks, she is truly and inspiration!!  Her workouts just keep getting better and better each time!!",1329350400,2,145,4.576923076923077
5070120,5,B0079QDAFK,"I absolutely love these workouts! I just finished my first trimester and have been doing these workouts from about week 7. I worked out regularly prior to becoming pregnant and these workouts are perfect for keeping in shape during your pregnancy. It really does focus on all the ""problem"" areas during pregnancy. Love it!!! Thanks for such an awesome product Joy!",1454457600,,364,4.983606557377049
5070121,5,B0079QDAFK,"This is my second time around using these DVDs.  I agree with all the other positive reviews.  Additionally, my very active 16 month old loves Joy and the music.  He loves to ""workout"" and dance along with me.  It's the only time it works!",1453075200,,239,4.363636363636363
5070122,5,B0079QDAFK,"This is an amazing set of workouts, and quite challenging. I workout 6 days a week, usually a mix of moderate strength training and jogging/stair mill, and I find these workouts to be plenty difficult. However, just as I'm starting to feel really fatigued, she moves to a new set of exercises and I'm able to complete the workout.

The instructor has a really positive, upbeat attitude, and she has TONS of energy! She does a great job targeting muscles that need special attention during pregnancy and in the postnatal period, and I was thankful for that after doing these workouts during my first pregnancy. Her core work helped eliminate my back pain, prevent the pregnancy waddle, and strengthen my upper back (which weakens and stretches both during pregnancy and even more so once you're constantly holding your baby).

I would not recommend this workout for beginners, as I think it would be too challenging and perhaps tough on the joints. However, if you are an experienced exerciser and want a rigorous, targeted workout to keep you in great shape, this plus cardio is really all you need. I weirdly really look forward to these workouts and find them to be complete, balanced, full-body workouts that are really targeted to the needs of the pregnant body.",1453075200,,1266,4.856481481481482
5070123,5,B0079QDAFK,Nice and challenging through out my entire pregnancy.  And she doesn't make you feel guilty when you just need to rest or do a modification.,1452556800,,140,4.6
5070124,4,B0079QDAFK,"I think this is a wonderful DVD.  I am a very active individual so I wanted to find that healthy balance with a good DVD.  Before I was pregnant I ran close to 30 miles a week and taught spinning so I really had to slow down.  this is a great workout to combine with a cardio workout.  I will do either one or two of the workouts and then combine it with a run or elliptical workout to get an hour of cardio in.  I definitely have noticed that I am now stronger and feel so much better about myself going through pregnancy.  However, I don't think doing just this DVD will help you stay in shape I would recommend combining it was something else.",1452124800,,646,4.087301587301587
5070125,4,B0079QDAFK,"I HAD SO MUCH FUN with this while pregnant! I kept it for the next one! I actually heard about it from my doctor! I stayed fit while pregnant, but this helped me the days I was too tired to go the gym! It does NOT strain your body and makes your feel great! I had a perfectly healthy pregnancy and really enjoyed her workouts!",1451520000,,326,4.030769230769231
5070126,5,B0079QDAFK,"I am 16 weeks pregnant and a first time mom. Everything about pregnancy is new and scary to me, so it is so comforting to know my workouts are 100% safe for me and my baby boy. I usually do T25, Jillian, and even Crossfit before pregnancy. This DVD works! I work up such a sweat. She keeps it moving, so it doesn't even feel like you are working out for a long amount of time. My butt and legs are sore for two days after. Such a fantastic workout!!!",1450828800,,450,4.011111111111111
5070127,5,B0079QDAFK,I'm used to doing Jillian Michaels DVDs and was nervous to slow down on my work outs. These videos are great and are very similar to what I'm used to just less cardio (which is a good thing because I get so winded since being pregnant),1450569600,,235,4.130434782608695
5070128,5,B0079QDAFK,Awesome workout!!! Keeps your muscles working!!,1450483200,,47,7.0
5070129,5,B0079QDAFK,I absolutely love these videos! They keep me energized and feeling good about myself. My husband says I am in better shape now then before getting pregnant. She encourages you to keep working out through the whole pregnancy. I am 33 weeks pregnant now and I am ordering her post pregnancy work out video because I love these so much.,1447286400,,333,4.566666666666666
5070130,5,B0079QDAFK,"I used this workout almost my entire pregnancy. I found it to be a nice challenge. I was used to doing pilates, yoga, and Jillian Michaels workouts before getting pregnant. This might be to tiring for someone that was not active before getting pregnant.",1447027200,,253,4.7727272727272725
5070131,5,B0079QDAFK,I was very active before pregnancy and had a hard time finding a pregnancy workout that made me feel like I was receiving a workout. I felt this DVD was perfect for me for pregnancy and highly recommend it.,1446249600,,206,4.3076923076923075
5070132,5,B0079QDAFK,I'm currently 23 weeks pregnant and have done all of the workouts for the first and second trimester videos; I love them! I love working out and having variety so I bought a whole bunch of pregnancy workouts and this one is the only one that I really feel gives me a workout so far. I'm sure the other ones will be more enjoyable to me the further along I get in my pregnancy. I'm most excited to continue with this DVD though and see what the third trimester workouts consist of! :),1444348800,,483,4.204301075268817
5070133,5,B0079QDAFK,GREAT!! I would recommend to any expecting mama.,1443916800,,48,5.125
5070134,5,B0079QDAFK,"I do NOT work out using DVDs normally. I'm a mountain biker, climber, hiker, weight trainer, but I knew I needed something to motivate me on those days when this wasn't an option for me. Reading the reviews, it wounded like Joy and the five star reviewers were my kind of people and so I took the plunge on this rather than investing in private Pilates lessons as an option to stay in shape ($$).

I am SO impressed with the set. It's definitely challenging and hitting me in places I haven't been sore in for years, which means it's really well rounded and I'm excited to be covering weak areas I never would. I've never seen a couple of the exercises she has you go through, and they're killer (those elevated leg exercises).

I was hesitant to buy the exercise ball and weights (I have both at a gym I run, but I can't do workouts with a DVD there), but after my first workout, I went right out and got them and a real mat instead of using my rug. I am committed because I believe in her program. I also like that she encourages you to only do her stuff three times a week so I don't feel like I'm over training if I go do something like climbing or surfing or what not the next day.

If you are an experienced exerciser, you'll appreciate this set. In fact, I really only wrote this review because I wanted to reward Joy for her awesome work.

Is the quality top notch? No, but I don't need studio bells and whistles, I need someone motivating to challenge me and she's doing a great job for a non-DVD workout person like me.

I'm currently 35 weeks pregnant with twins and while I've had to make modifications over time to stay up on it - I completely credit Joy's program with my mobility, lack of swelling, ""all of it in my stomach"" pregnancy. I feel amazing, I sleep well, and every time I feel myself slide downhill, I make sure I use what she's taught me and work on those pelvic tilts, hip strengtheners, etc. People say I look amazing, better than before being pregnant, and while I'm not 100% my old self, I am so grateful to the guidance.",1442534400,2,2052,4.26478149100257
5070135,5,B0079QDAFK,Love these DVDs.  Used them my entire pregnancy,1441843200,,47,4.875
5070136,5,B0079QDAFK,"This was my most favorite prenatal exercise DVDs.  Loved them.  Teacher is upbeat and exercises are very useful.  Unlike most prenatal workouts, I actually felt like I was working out.  Could not recommend this enough.",1440115200,,218,5.142857142857143
5070137,5,B0079QDAFK,I did this workout the majority of my first pregnancy & it was worth every second. Joy is very motivating & she kept me on track with my weight gain! I'd recommend this for any momma-to-be & you can bet I'll be doing it during my next pregnancy.,1439424000,,245,4.125
5070138,5,B0079QDAFK,"I would recommend these workouts to all pregnant women who are willing to stay ""fit"" during their pregnancy. I relied on reviews when making my decision to purchase this video and want to help guide other women. I am a runner and Beach Body advocate (T25, Insanity, Insanity Max) and wanted to continue to work out through my pregnancy. I purchased these but did not use the first trimester because I was continuing my regular workout. I started using the second trimester at around14 weeks. I used the videos and my own cardio up until 36 weeks when I decided sleep was more important.... I gained 40 pounds during my pregnancy and people told me they couldn't tell I was pregnant from the back. Most importantly, when I had my 9 pound baby by C-section, my recovery was amazing! I did not work out with my first baby and my recovery was a nightmare. This time I was up and walking more easily. I was active faster. And once the baby bloat all disappeared I was only 6 pounds over my pre-pregnancy weight. Now, my baby will be three months this week and I am back into my Beach Body workouts.
Truth be told, Joy can be a little ""too"" happy that we are all pregnant and working out but if you can get past that you will be happy you did. The workout is challenging where it needs to be and absolutely worth it!",1437350400,2,1310,4.351020408163265
5070139,5,B0079QDAFK,"Prior to pregnancy I was active and doing Jillian Michael's work out dvd's.  I was worried about keeping in shape during pregnancy but not sure what exercises were safe and acceptable to do.  I highly recommend this dvd series.  The lady, Joy, who does the videos is not annoying like some instructors are.  I find her instructions easy to follow and her attitude (pleasant but not overly fake) makes me want to do the videos.  And don't worry, the exercises will get your heart rate up as pregnancy changes you body and breathing.  I also bought another prenatal work out with is one, by a different lady, and used it once.  Joy's workouts are by far my favorite.  I've been doing these 2x a week starting in the first tri to where I am today (3rd tri), along with yoga, and I've been able to stay in good shape.  I highly recommend her workouts.",1436227200,,847,4.4480519480519485
5070140,5,B0079QDAFK,"Love, love, love.....a must have for every mommy to be that wants to stay fit.  This was one of my favorite pregnancy DVDs.",1435104000,,123,4.3478260869565215
5070141,5,B0079QDAFK,"With my first pregnancy four years ago, I stopped working out, ate terribly, gained 60 lbs, had terrible morning sickness lasting well into second trimester, had blood pressure issues, and was just plain uncomfortable/miserable. When I became pregnant 5 months ago, I was determined not to go down that path again.

I got this dvd set later in my first trimester and I can't rave about it enough. The exercises are challenging but fun and I thoroughly enjoy Joy, the instructor. I've stuck with basically just doing this dvd set as my main source of workout - I'm nearly 22 weeks pregnant and this time around has been SO much better - dare I say, this pregnancy is actually enjoyable?!  I totally credit this dvd set.

I've maintained a steady, healthy rate of weight gain, my energy is great, blood pressure perfect, and I generally just feel so much better. I do Joy's workouts at least three times a week. I love the circuit training style with weights, cardio and some pilates.  The workouts are tough but feel completely safe on my belly, back etc.  She offers modified options to make the workouts a bit easier, and constantly gives cues on staying safe: tighten core to protect lower back, breath naturally and normally, even modified options if you have diastasis recti.

I love this dvd set and will recommend it to all my friends who may become pregnant in the future as a way to stay fit and strong!",1434931200,,1411,4.646586345381526
5070142,5,B0079QDAFK,"These are the perfect pregnancy workouts, even if you trained regularly prior to becoming pregnant. Challenging, not boring, and excellent instruction. Would highly recommend!",1432857600,,175,6.333333333333333
5070143,5,B0079QDAFK,"This is by far the best prenatal workout series out there. I had good results with another video series with my first child, but with my second, I wanted to try something new. I did this all the way up until an hour before I delivered (fast labor) and it kept me in great shape. I highly recommend it. Challenging enough for fitness buffs for me, but it doesn't put you or your baby at risk.",1432166400,,391,4.157894736842105
5070144,5,B0079QDAFK,"Seriously love this DVD. I researched a lot of pregnancy DVDs and as someone who pre-pregnancy stays very active with the Tough Mudder and mud races as well as insanity classes at my local gym, I feel so good doing these workouts that are still a challenge but safe for the baby!",1430092800,,279,4.384615384615385
5070145,3,B0079QDAFK,more weight training and less cardio than what I was expecting.,1428278400,,63,4.818181818181818
5070146,5,B0079QDAFK,"I wish I had gotten this DVD set earlier in my pregnancy! I just entered my 3rd trimester and also just got this - I've been doing her 3rd trimester workouts for about a week - and this is the first time throughout my pregnancy that I've felt like my old self, strong and proactive and GOOD in my body. These workouts are challenging but definitely doable, and the woman talks about how the exercises are specifically aimed at the parts of the body that are strained during pregnancy or important during labor...again, I wish I'd gotten these sooner!",1428105600,,550,4.565656565656566
5070147,3,B0079QDAFK,"I've been doing Jillian Michaels workouts for about 8 months now and I've been really proud of the fact that I am able to do the harder options within the workouts but now that I am expecting I thought it wise to follow a workout to help me along during these next months.  Can I just say that I've only worked on then1st trimester DVD and I couldn't even perform the leg workouts in either workout entirely.  Omg! I would scream constantly.  So- not sure if this a good workout yet or not but it is not an easy one.  If you didn't workout prior to pregnancy, it's probably not for you.",1427328000,2,586,4.205357142857143
5070148,5,B0079QDAFK,"I have always worked out and I didn't want to stop when I got pregnant. I found these workout videos great to keep you in shape and active during pregnancy. I recommend them for someone who is a regular exerciser, tough she gives modifications to make it easier or tougher for you. Love the scenarios as well, the beach, the mountains...Joy is great to keep you motivated.",1426204800,,372,4.567164179104478
5070149,5,B0079QDAFK,"Just got the video on Friday and did the workout on Saturday. It was awesome! I agree with many of the other reviewers. This is a workout that is particularly perfect for someone who was working out before you were pregnant and now you want something that is tailored towards your new pregnancy state. Before I was pregnant, I worked out about 3-5x/week - bootcamp, cycling, HIIT, etc. I found myself trying (slowly, of course) to do those same workouts, yet constantly worrying if it was okay for me to do a certain move or not. The video was challenging yet I was comfortable knowing that I was not harming myself or the baby.",1425772800,,628,4.517543859649122
5070150,5,B0079QDAFK,"Pre-pregnancy, I was doing BurstFit, BurstFit Fire, and T25!  I'm currently 27 weeks and am loving these workouts, which I started around week 6 of my pregnancy!  They are challenging (and can be made more so by increasing/adding weights) and fun!  I hope to continue with them until I deliver.  I would not recommend them for beginners, though...too many variables with respect to form!",1424044800,2,387,5.0
5070151,4,B0079QDAFK,"I like how these work outs are designed around each separate trimester, and the instructor is fun and encouraging. Its like working out with a girlfriend who happens to be incredibly fit. The first time I did one of these workouts I was trying to maintain my prepregnancy fitness level, and majorly over-did it. I did not listen to her warnings about NOT over exerting yourself. Since then, I've taken her advice and I'm really liking these dvd's. I'm not to the 3rd trimester yet tho. you will need an exercise ball and free weights to follow along.",1423872000,,550,4.622448979591836
5070152,5,B0079QDAFK,I am in love with this video!!! I am still on the first trimester dvd and am definitely going to keep up with it through my whole pregnancy. I am use to doing Jillian michaels videos but it had been months since I had worked out at all. I feel like I am in better shape now than before I was pregnant!,1423267200,,301,3.870967741935484
5070153,5,B0079QDAFK,"Amazing! So before becoming pregnant I would do workouts like Jillian michaels 30 day shred, and P25, and I was concerned that all pregnancy videos would be easy and lame for me, and was very impressed with this workout. This video is tough but safe and totally appropriate for each trimester. Honestly, the girl is a little annoying but the moves are effective and the videos are short and doable.",1423180800,,398,4.7
5070154,5,B0079QDAFK,"I didn't know that a 10-minute workout could be so intense. I love how she gets right into the workouts without wasting precious second. She understands how busy new moms are. Each workout starts with a dynamic warm-up typically with a band. I don't have band, so I just go without or sometimes substitute in with light dumbbells. I love the mommy and baby workout, too. Very fun, and my baby always giggles when we do this one. I get actually doing these workouts, and I love how you can combine workouts if time allows. I enjoyed her prenatal workout dvd, too. I usually get bored with workout dvds/podcasts, but her workouts fly by for me for some reason. Very highly recommend.",1422489600,,681,4.590163934426229
5070155,5,B0079QDAFK,"These DVDs are a must for any pregnant woman who wants to remain strong and feel really great throughout her entire pregnancy.  I'm currently 39 weeks, and still working out with these DVDs a few mornings each week.  I can't believe that at this point in my pregnancy I feel so strong, and am really grateful to have found this series.

Pre-pregnancy I enjoyed high intensity workouts like Jillian Michaels Body Revolution, running and spinning.  During my first trimester I continued with my old videos, modifying where necessary.  In the beginning of my second trimester, I started to feel like I needed a better guide for specific exercises and positions that would benefit my body as it started to change.  After doing a lot of reading, and research I ordered a handful of videos, but this set was the only one I felt was the right fit, and the only one I stuck with.

Now at 39 weeks I stand tall, I don't have the pregnancy waddle, I am not struggling with my balance, I don't have back pain, and my muscles are still visible.  People comment on this all of the time - I hear things like ""you're so spry"" and it's because of these workouts.  All of the things I worried about before becoming pregnant have not happened.  Thank goodness for Joy! Thank you thank you thank you!!",1422316800,,1282,4.534782608695652
5070156,5,B0079QDAFK,"I admit that I don't typically write reviews (I know...terrible), but I felt compelled to review this prenatal workout series. I am now in my 8th month of pregnancy and this is the ONLY workout that I enjoy doing (I've tried other prenatal workout series). Joy gives you a quick, challenging workout that will make you feel great about maintaining a healthy fitness level for you and baby. I was in great shape before becoming pregnant and I admit that I have to hit pause several times during the workout. As I begin to plan for my post-baby workout routine, Joy's postnatal series is already in my DVD collection. She is fantastic...this is a must-have during your pregnancy if you want to maintain a fitness routine.",1421107200,2,719,4.714285714285714
5070157,5,B0079QDAFK,"LOVE these workouts!!  Can't speak highly enough about these workouts or Joy, they were awesome and helped me to stay in shape and work out safely throughout my pregnancy.  I would do these workouts at home but them also do some of the exercises at the gym after doing cardio.  Also, do yourself a favor and get the post natal workout DVD also, it's also great!",1419638400,,361,4.4393939393939394

5070159,1,B0079QDAFK,The third dvd was a duplicate second trimester dvd. Did not know till after 30 day return policy because obviously trimesters last longer than 30 days.,1418947200,2,151,4.846153846153846
5070160,5,B0079QDAFK,"Great 30 minute workout! I regularly do boot camp so this seemed a little easy for me at first, but I was soon sweating and I was sore the next day. Joy is easy to follow along with and not annoying like some other workout video leaders.",1416009600,,237,4.0638297872340425

However this is my second pregnancy and my first is 1 yr old and I am finding it hard to have energy  to do my usual 1 hour workouts. This is not a full 30 min, I would say it's about 20 workout with ten stretching but that 20 min I feel is a good workout and hits most muscles. I like she uses 8 pound weights and does a good amount of reps. I really like it and it hits the spot for me right now.",1415145600,,452,3.7083333333333335
5070162,5,B0079QDAFK,I can't say anything for the first trimester portion as I was so sick! But I bought this in the second trimester and am VERY pleased with the workouts. I am a Zumba/Class Fitness instructor and since leaving my classes I felt I needed something at home to help keep me in shape.  I feel like I'm getting a really good workout and I feel confident that these workouts were made for pregnancy by a focused instructor. Joy is such a good instructor and I can't wait to see what the third trimester classes will consist of!,1414540800,,519,4.350515463917525
5070163,5,B0079QDAFK,I really liked this DVD set. I didn't start until my second trimester so I started on the second DVD. There are 3 DVDs 1 for each trimester. It's easy enought to do while prego but it's also a great workout. You will sweat. I also like it because Joy (the instructor) is prego so your working out with someone who is in the same shape (round growing belly). Great workout for arms and legs. She even has techniques to work on your stomach muscles and kegels.,1414281600,,458,4.275862068965517
5070164,2,B0079QDAFK,"will recommend as the workout really target the essential areas of mum-to-be's body. the only thing is we received defect DVD, the 3rd trimester DVD turn out to be the same as 2nd trimester only with different labels. we try to contact the bodybytrimester but unfortunately we did not get any response, can't return either. I recommend when you receive this dvd sets, try out all 3 dvds to make sure they are the right ones.",1410134400,2,424,4.592105263157895
5070165,5,B0079QDAFK,"I bought this DVD after reading other reviews and it was awesome!  As someone who had done Insanity before I got pregnant, I wanted something that wasn't super slow or easy.  The workouts were not overly hard and the perfect length. I did them 3-5 days a week up until about 38 weeks. I ended up having a c section and I believe this truly helped my recovery be a fast and smooth one.",1410048000,,384,4.175675675675675
5070166,5,B0079QDAFK,I really like this DVD. I have various prenatal workouts and this is the best by far. I have tried the pregnacy project which is kind of boring and I don't feel like I get a really work out. I also have the Lisa hart DVD which is ok I do get a small sweat but I am a very active person and wanted to feel like I was getting a real work out! With this video I feel like it's what I am used to doing - circuit training . I have been lifting for a few years and run and so all kinds of workouts from insanity to p90x to hiit workouts so I am not a beginner . I find this challenging as I am 24 weeks preggo but not too drained.,1409529600,,624,3.6296296296296298
5070167,4,B0079QDAFK,"You can definitely tell Joy isn't a veteran exercise video leader. She stumbles with her wording a bit and looks down at what she's supposed to be reading at times.

I would recommend this to any mommies-to-be who have already been active prior to getting pregnant, as (in my opinion) these warm ups and workouts are for a more seasoned body. Of course, modifications can always be made. Another plus is that Joy Southworth has a fresh and inviting energy that make the 30 mins SO worth the burn/sweat.

However, I have not been using these videos much.  I found that the intense part of the video was very short (about 12 min), and after that you do more abdominal work and stretching.  I also didn't like how there are only a few strength training moves, and as I mentioned above, these videos do not have a long cardio component.  I think this video would be great for someone who is a moderate exerciser.

Since there are 3 videos for each trimester, I have enough variety to not get bored throughout the week doing them.  The exercises are challenging and I feel like i got a good workout by the end.

She's encouraging but not cheesy, and the workouts are challenging enough to make you feel good that you did something great for yourself and the baby.  If you're a beginner, this is easy enough for you with the modifications she gives. She's constantly reminding you why each exercise is good for labor, the baby, or for yourself as a soon to be mom.

Pre-pregnancy, I did Crossfit 2x/week, ran 3-4 miles 2x/week, and did my own workouts a couple more times a week. I thought this would be easy/boring, but I was wrong and I love it.  I've been doing these when I had morning sickness, it was too cold or raining outside, fatigue hit too hard to commit to Crossfit, and now that running is too challenging with having to pee every 15 minutes. I can hit pause, take a pee break, then come back to the video. With pregnancy there are days when you just can not find the motivation to get out and do your normal workouts, and this is perfect for that.",1390003200,2,1009,4.385026737967914

Each disc provides 2 30-minute workouts with some upper and lower body muscle work (with light weights), some core moves, including planks and pushups, and a cool-down. I am especially impressed with Joy's attention to core strength; I think all the pelvic tilts and abdominal pulses are keeping me back pain free.  Plus, it's good to have a reminder to keep up with your Kegels.  I usually do one of the workouts in conjunction with 30 minutes of yoga, another workout DVD (at 25 weeks I can't keep up with Jillian anymore, but Jackie Werner's strength stuff is still working well), or walking/running--I'm used to an hour a day, and I do think I could use a little more cardio.

5070179,5,B0079QDAFK,"I'm in my first trimester, only 6 weeks pregnant, and have been doing these for a week now.  So  this review so far is based on the FIRST TRIMESTER workouts.  (I'll update with each trimester)

FITNESS LEVEL:
-Previous to pregnancy, I had NOT worked out for 3 months, so I'm a bit out of shape, but I HAVE done jillian michaels body revolution in the past, on and off - never made it past 2 months at a time.  So I was worried that these might be too intense for me since I haven't worked out for awhile and I'm about 25 pounds heavier than I'd like to be at the start of my pregnancy.  HOWEVER, these are PERFECT!  She gives modifications to make it easier if it's too tough for you, and she also gives modifications to make it more difficult if you're already used to working out like this and you can step it up.  I do the LOW modifications, and I feel like I get a GREAT workout, but it's definitely ""do-able"" and not too intense that I feel like I'm dying.  She constantly reminds you to listen to your body, take water breaks if you need it, and to stop and pause it if it feels too strenuous or if you can't speak normally because you're breathing too hard.  I take these into consideration and a couple times I have paused it to let my heart rate go back down a bit before continuing.

THE INSTRUCTOR:
I love her!  Some of these reviews said she's cheesy, but I don't see that at all.  She just seems like a nice normal happy person to me.  I can tell she knows what she's talking about and she constantly reminds you about the proper form you should have, in an easy way to visualize and understand.

EQUIPMENT:
she uses a yoga ball for a couple exercises here and there.  She also uses 5 and 8 pound weights, but encourages you to use which weight feels best for your own level.  I have been using 3 and 5 pounds.

SETTING:
It's set on a beach, which I find very pretty and relaxing.  I love the scenery behind her :)

LENGTH OF WORKOUTS:
There are two 30-minute workouts and one 15-minute express workout.  The 30 minute ones are 3 minutes of ""warmup"", about 21-22 minutes of ""workout"", and 5-6 minutes of ""cooldown.""  The express workout is the same 3 minute warmup, a 13 minute workout, and 5-6 minutes of cooldown.

FREQUENCY:
She recommends doing her workouts 3 days a week, and supplementing the other days with other workouts.  So I supplement those other days with other cardio workouts so that I'm alternating between strength and cardio each day.  These are some I've been using for the cardio workouts that I love:

1.  Fat Burning Workout for Dummies with Gay Gasper
great for pregnancy because you can do it all low-impact.  I've always loved these routines.  and you can stop it after any section if you get too tired) - here's the link:
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=fat+burning+workout+for+dummies

2. Expecting More-Sara Haley's Daily Sweat Pregnancy Program
I haven't tried the strength training workouts on this yet but have enjoyed the cardio ones-here's the link:
http://www.amazon.com/Expecting-More-Haleys-Pregnancy-Program/dp/B0065WELMU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389977623&sr=8-1&keywords=expecting+more+sara+haley%27s+daily+sweat+pregnancy+program

MY ONLY CRITICISM:
The cooldown is nice to get your heartrate back down but there's no stretching.  I have been SUPER sore this week (in a good way), and that's to be expected anyway, especially since I haven't been working out for awhile, but I think stretching would've lessened the soreness.  I will probably start a stretch routine of my own to end with

SIDENOTE:
I think it's pretty hilarious that the three 1-star bad reviews are all from people who never actually watched the DVDs!

OVERALL:
Love the workouts and highly recommend them!!!",1389916800,16,3777,4.913112164296998
5070183,5,B0079QDAFK,"Excellent exercise DVD for women who were active prior to pregnancy. When I got pregnant I was doing a modified version of p90x and spinning 2-3 times a week, so I searched specifically for a DVD that would be challenging and help me maintain my fitness level. Based on other reviews, I bought body by trimester, jennifer wolfe's prenatal yoga and ellen barrett's power fusion. I've been doing body by trimester since late in my first trimester. All are good and each meet very different goals.

The body by trimester DVD is a set of challenging strengthening exercises that engage multiple muscle groups. Joy focuses on problem areas for pregnant ladies like hip strengthening, upper back and abdominal toning. There are two 30 minute workouts and 1 15-minute workout for each trimester, in addition to a warm-up, but I only do the longer ones. (The 15 min workouts are serious too though. The challenge is maintained in all workouts.)I have a low back injury that I thought would cause a lot of pain during pregnancy, but thanks to doing this workout (among others) my pain has been minimal. I started my third trimester a few weeks ago and was surprised to see that Joy maintains the challenge to the end! Mountain climbers (yes with modifications) in the 3rd trimester?! It's great. I think she's crazy as I do the exercises but when I'm done I'm always glad that I did it.

If you were not active prior to pregnancy I think you'd find some of the exercises tough, but they would still be doable with lighter weights than what Joy uses. Because each workout is so short, I think anyone could do it as long as they lightened the weight.

I do wish that the workouts were a little longer with 15 minutes or so of moderately challenging exercises. I sometimes supplement with a 15-30 mins on the elliptical on the days I do body by trimester, which is about 2x per week. I also do prenatal yoga, cardio on the elliptical and one other DVD workout (power fusion) for variety for a total of about 4 workouts per week. May this all pay-off later...we'll see!",1388793600,,2056,4.612021857923497
5070184,5,B0079QDAFK,"Joy definitely knows what she's doing.  I'm into my 2nd trimester workouts and I get a good sweat without overexerting myself. I'm excited for the 3rd trimester workouts.  I love how she encourages you to help you keep going to do what's best for you and your baby.  I've tried other prenatal workouts, but this is by far the best.  Joy knows how to transition into the next workouts and I love that it's in circuits.  I'm very picky with workouts since I can feel if my body will transition well into the next moves, and this works great for me.  Another thing I like is that this workout has a good pace, which doesn't make me sleepy compared to other workouts.  These workouts have really helped me maintain my weight during my pregnancy, and really helped me during my first trimester when I felt nauseous.  Try these workouts for yourself!",1386633600,2,844,4.543046357615894
5070185,5,B0079QDAFK,"I love this dvd and it's workouts.  It's the perfect length (at 30 minutes total stretching and exercising) and it's challenging enough so I feel like I got a great workout without overdoing it. I usually do 30 minutes of cardio (walking or elliptical) and then do this video and it's great. I've only done the 2nd trimester routines at this point, but am looking forward to the 3rd trimester dvd. I probably wouldn't do just this video as the same workouts over and over would become boring. I would recommend adding a pilates or yoga video to the mix.",1384128000,,553,4.53

I am would consider myself a fit person, however I mostly walk and do yoga.  This is video is focused on toning with weights, which i just found too difficult.  I would suggest for someone who has worked out similarly prior to pregnancy, but just not for me.",1383609600,,427,4.158536585365853
5070187,4,B0079QDAFK,"This is a great option for a pregnancy workout but not the only one I will be doing throughout my pregnancy. I received this and started the workout in my second trimester. I was pretty active before pregnancy (running 3-5 miles, Jillian Michael's Body Revolution) and continued my normal exercise routine into the first trimester without any specific pregnancy workouts.

I only complete the 3 workouts a week and I can only comment on the 2nd trimester disc. That's what's on the DVD -- two full and one express. I supplement this disc with jogging and a workout App when I'm travelling (circuits without weights). The included Warm-Up (some breathing, side steps and marching) is universal and is a separate item on the Main Menu, but the Cool Downs are included in the regular program and a little different for each workout.

The Full workout is 4 rounds of two supersets. Example, Lunges + Bicep Curls, then Squats. Repeat. Then there are three more sets like that. ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GHGH.  She uses the ball only for one or two of the moves and she is using a set each of 5 and 8 pound hand weights. I use 3 and 5 pound weights but that's what is suggested -- use what you are comfortable with and what you have. Joy has some suggestions on increasing intensity (jumping) and suggestions on taking it easy (don't use weights). You get what you put into it.",1383264000,,1363,4.577868852459017

I get cardio and strength, it challenges me and I am sore the next day and it is pregnancy specific. I plan to use it all the way through my pregnancy. So glad I bought it!  I was doing Jillian Anderson and HIIT before I got pregnant and this has challenged me all the way through.  Please make another one, Joy.  And I am looking forward to your post-natal workout!",1382227200,,518,4.410526315789474
5070191,4,B0079QDAFK,"So, I got Joy Southworth's Body by Trimester workout DVD around week 6 of my pregnancy and have finally been able to workout consistently on a daily basis. I give it 4 stars!

Before I knew about our little Sea Monkey, I had been on my second week of my second round of Insanity, having completed one full 3 month cycle already. Insanity was well named, and pretty intense. It also worked and gave me noticeable definition within the first month. When my Primary Care Physician confirmed my pregnancy, she told me I had to cut it out, explaining that light to moderate exercise was good for me and the baby, but anything as intensive as Insanity could be harmful.

Because of Insanity, I felt a little like a fitness badass and with this information I wanted something safe for baby and me, but also something that was still challenging. I Googled a bunch of prenatal fitness videos and after slogging through about a half billion reviews decided to go with something that had different workouts for different stages of pregnancy.

After actually trying Body by Trimester my delusions of physical prowess are much diminished and I no longer feel like a fitness badass. There are a couple of reasons for this. Number one is that I am exhausted ALL. THE. TIME. Number two is that the DVDs are actually pretty tough. They aren't ""My legs are shaking and I think I might either throw up or fall down"" tough like insanity, but they have a lot of feminine muscle targeting which Insanity lacked.

Now that I've actually been working out regularly, I've found that while there is barely any cardio, this is still challenging stuff. It targets your hips and thighs and waist in ways that Insanity didn't. There are also pelvic floor exercises, abdominal exercises, shoulder and arm exercises, and they even include kegels (during which she exclaims ""Oooooh!  You're working so hard right now and nobody even knows it!""). The instructor is 11 weeks pregnant herself, so you don't feel like the Pillsbury Doughboy when you watch her workout. She's also chipper, super informative about what's going on with your body right now, and she offers modifications to each exercise if you're feeling either sporty or tired.

Over all, I like it. It's a challenge and it's keeping me active, but because there are only 3 DVDs with 3 different workouts on each, I'm getting kind of bored and can't wait to start trimester two.

I was surprising pleased with how great each of Joy's workouts were. I was constantly moving, breaking a sweat (which is really important to me) and felt like I had actually worked out after I was done. She coached me through routines that I, nor anyone around me, thought I could actually be doing at 30 plus weeks pregnant.

5070195,3,B0079QDAFK,"So far I have only done the first trimester workouts but these workouts are NOT what the other reviews make them out to be. I did not sweat one droplet and seeing as during the first trimester there's very little restrictions on what you can do for exercise this makes NO sense to me. They are 30 minute workouts but you spend so much time cooling down at the end (and breathing and doing kegals etc) you're only actually in the circuit for like 15 minutes and it's mostly strength...very little low impact cardio. Each time I finished a workout I had to pop in another DVD or go for a run so I felt like I didn't completely waste the time I set aside for working out.

I will say before getting pregnant I did high intensity circuit training, so I am in very good shape and someone who isn't may find these DVD's perfect for them...but if you're already in shape and used to getting a good sweat every day these are going to be a HUGE disappointment (at least the first trimester will be).

I am planning to keep the DVD's in the hopes that when I reach 2nd or 3rd trimester those workouts will be better suited to help me figure out what I can still do, but for the 1st trimester they're really a waste...my doctor cleared me to do anything I was doing before (with slightly less intensity than before) and I think that will be a better use of my time...",1379203200,4,1356,4.251937984496124

5070200,5,B0079QDAFK,"When I found out I was pregnant, I did a lot of research about what kinds of prenatal workout DVDs were out there. Although, I'm a fitness DVD fanatic, I'm also about 20 pounds overweight and in intermediate (not at all advanced) shape. So, I knew I'd be buying something that would be a fun but not overwhelming challenge.

I'm so, so glad I decided on Body by Trimester! I've been doing the first trimester workouts 3x week for 2 months and am not at all sick of them. Joy is a fabulous instructor - perky and positive but not at all annoying and the beach set is beautiful. The length of the workout is perfect for me (30 minutes with a warm-up and cooldown) and gets me feeling sweaty and happy. When I'm done I feel I've gotten a complete, full-body workout and I find I have much more energy for the day.

Don't be intimidated if you're worried this workout is only for hard-core Insanity and P-90x devotees. Joy always gives modification options and repeatedly reminds you to take breaks, get water and do what YOU are comfortable with. I have no doubt this DVD is going to keep me in great shape for the rest of my pregnancy. For what it's worth, at the start of my second trimester I've only gained 2 pounds, which is what my doctor recommended for me, despite a pretty junky diet (morning sickness left me with awful cravings). I am sure that doing this workout is what has kept my weight gain under control.

I purchased this set to ensure that I was strengthening the right muscles and getting my body ready for labor/birth.  I love that it is broken down into 3 DVD's too, because there are different things that you can do during each trimester.  I don't think that this DVD would be enough for a stand alone regular work out, but I have found it a wonderful resource for me to go along with my normal cardio workout.

She brings a lot of knowledge and certifications with her and the exercises are bringing up your heart rate and make you sweat if you do them right. However, it does not feel like its too much for one's body or harmful for the baby. She also gives special instructions for women with diastasis recti.
Before I got pregnant I actually started doing P90X, then the flu hit me and right after we found out I was pregnant. I cannot say that I was belonging to the super athletic and fit people, even with P90X as a good start (I would say I am pretty average). Do not get intimidated by the statement ""Not for beginners"". It truly is possible to do it and as Joy says: Always listen to your body while exercising. You will realize where you need to make modifications for your fitness level. For example, I am not able to do the exercise displayed on the front of the dvd case for a long time just because I do not have enough core muscles for it (yet). Joy shows this exercise also while kneeling on the floor so it is easier in the beginning and with time of regular exercise, muscles will come anyway so you will be able to get even more out of the workouts. One thing I do miss though is the big variety of exercises I got with P90X (13 dvds!!!) but I will just compensate and do other sports then.",1370908800,2,1487,4.221052631578948
5070205,5,B0079QDAFK,"I am 13 weeks pregnant and I have been doing the Body by Trimester workouts pretty much since week 7, two weeks after I found out I was pregnant.  Before pregnancy I was used to doing boot camp high intensity workouts three times per week.  When I found out I was pregnant I knew I still wanted to workout during my pregnancy but I figured it would be wise to stop the boot camps and try to find prenatal workouts instead.  However I did not want a workout for dummies, I wanted something that would still challenge my body since I had already been working out for a while.  Body by Trimester was everything I was looking for.  I love that it comes with three DVD's, one per trimester, and each DVD has three different workouts.  Two of the workouts are only 30 minutes and 1 is an express workout for 15-20 minutes.  They are all great workouts! Not too intense, not too crazy, but it will make you break a good sweat and she focuses on very important things like keeping your back strong, working your pelvic muscles, and finishes every workout with Kegels.  I just started the second DVD for the second trimester and I love the new exercises she incorporated.  I can't wait to try the third trimester DVD.  Worth the money, thank you Joy Southworth!",1370390400,2,1252,4.427947598253275
5070206,5,B0079QDAFK,"I'm writing this review after finishing up one of the workouts on the 3rd trimester DVD; I'm currently 41 weeks pregnant (I can still do the workouts, but I am using most of the modification suggestions and taking more water and rest breaks). These workouts have been a lifesaver for fitting in strength training that I know is safe for the trimester I'm in. As someone who has always found it easy to be active with cardio but not as much with weights, I appreciated the modifications I could use to make things more do-able for someone without as much of a strength background (I've definitely never done P-90X and I own Jillian Michael's Shred DVD but haven't made it past level 2). The 1st trimester DVD I remember feeling was a little easier than I expected, but I also wasn't dealing with any morning sickness beyond basic nausea so that may have helped. The 2nd trimester workouts left me the most sore afterwards, and the 3rd trimester ones have felt the most challenging during without leaving me sore later. I appreciate the interval aspect of these too as I had to stop running after 38 weeks and this is the closest I can get now to working up a real sweat.

Anyway, I think these DVDs are great for people of varying fitness levels as long as you have a decent base, and I am excited to start up the postnatal edition soon!",1370304000,,1336,4.475409836065574
5070207,2,B0079QDAFK,"This dvd is perfect for those of you who are already working out and will keep you going throughout your pregnancy. I was disappointed once I received it because it contained 1-1st trimester and 2-2nd trimester, so the 3rd trimester dvd was missing.

I could have made a higher quality video in my back yard.  Recommend just using a Youtube video, as this set didn't have any workouts that could have made up for the quality or that you couldn't have made up on your own.",1368316800,3,340,4.467741935483871
5070210,5,B0079QDAFK,This is my first and only review I have ever done. I absolutely love these videos. Unfortunately I didn't find them until late into my second trimester after wasting money on other horrible workout videos. These videos make you feel so good and I combined them with a prenatal yoga video and walking each week and was amazed at how small my stomach has already become today 10 days after giving birth to my son! Just got done ordering her postnatal workouts as well!!!,1368230400,,468,4.583333333333333
5070211,5,B0079QDAFK,"I got these DVDs about halfway through my first trimester. What I really enjoy is that you get a full workout with some cardio in a half hour because of the combination moves and super setting. This is a challenging workout but she gives nice alternatives so you can still complete the workout without straining yourself. Don't let that picture of the instructor doing a full plank scare you away, that is definitely not a requirement for these videos.

Another plus is that you only need minimal equipment, heavy and light hand weights, and exercise ball and a mat. I use a set of 5 lb dumb bells, and two cans of tomatoes for my weights.

Yes, workout DVDs get repetitive, (anything would get boring if you had to watch it three times a week forever) but there are three workouts included for each trimester so you can mix it up.  I like to get up a little early and knock one of these out before I get ready for work, that way I start the day feeling like I accomplished something and it helps keep me awake at my desk job.

I just started on the second trimester disc, and the abdominal moves are great. The exercises involve functional movements that you may encounter in your day like bending down and shifting to the side so it really helps you adapt to the changes that pregnancy brings. I will update this again when I hit the third trimester!

So I'm almost 8 months along now, and I've gotten familiar with the third semester workouts. I did upgrade my lighter weights to a set of 3 pound dumb bells, but other than that everything is the same. I still enjoy the workouts. The abdominal moves are more challenging for me now, but I'm not sure how much of that is due to the new moves and how much is due to me getting larger. I have not had any lower back pain during my pregnancy, so I'm assuming the workouts are helping me there. I also feel much more awake and alert at work on the days that I workout. I'm really glad that I purchased this set and I am going to look into her post-partum workouts as well.",1367020800,,2021,4.307894736842106
5070212,5,B0079QDAFK,This DVD offers a well rounded circuit work-out for all three trimesters of pregnancy.  I bought it based on other reviews.  I'm not a hard core exerciser at the moment (and was slacking before I got pregnant) and I felt the 30 minute workout offered just what I needed.  I found the core work to be a little difficult but the lower and upper body work to be perfect.  I'll likely use it after baby as well and modify some of the exercises.,1366848000,,440,4.265060240963855
5070213,5,B0079QDAFK,"Prior to this pregnancy I was working out using turbofire and had just started Les Mills combat right before becoming pregnant.  During my first trimester I took some time off from working out due to nausea but when I felt good I was able to fit in the first trimester workout DVD. The length is perfect - 30 minutes - I know that I can get a workout in before work, during nap times or whenever I am free. I definitely ""feel"" the workout - works upper body, back, abs, hips,glutes, thighs - mixed with cardio. This helps you maintain your level of fitness, you are not trying to loose weight or anything.
Second trimester video also really good - the express videos are intense and I really feel like I'm doing something when I finished. I recommend this to people that workout and are looking for something to do while pregnant this offers somewhat of a challenge.",1366675200,3,866,4.481012658227848
5070214,4,B0079QDAFK,"I like these fun videos.  I was looking for a way to workout while pregnant and the gym just didn't seem appealing to me (ie wearing tight spandex while I was pre-cute-baby-bump was just humiliating).  So I looked for a fitness video I could do in my own home and feel comfortable.  Joy is really a ""joy"" to work out with.  She's young and hip but not annoying.  She's fun to listen to and she keeps you going and encourages you without sounding like a Barbie doll or a drill sergeant. I felt like I was just working out with a friend.  Also, the exercises to me, an athletic person seemed a little novice, but being pregnant my heart definitely was pumping hard to keep up.  She does a lot of thigh, hip, buttock workouts to strength those muscles for labor and the day after I did the video my legs were soooo sore!  She also makes you sit and do Kegels which I found helpful, because I forget to do them.

P.S. you'll need an exercise ball and some 5-8 lbs weights to play along.",1366416000,17,982,4.236559139784946
5070215,3,B0079QDAFK,"Like some of the reviewer, I got bored of the pace and the routine.  It's good strength training and low impact design to work those trouble area.  I love especially that she tells you how to avoid injury and give you analogy and description so you can correctly do the excercise.  I worked up a sweat when I did do them...however, I just don't find myself excited and pick this up when I have free time.  I'm still going to the hiphop class at my local gym though.  Perhaps I'll give it another try when I'm further along and can no longer jump around to rap music.  Give it a try if you're more discipline then me.",1364342400,,616,4.222222222222222
5070216,5,B0079QDAFK,"My husband bought these for me when I was 28 weeks along as I was no longer able to do my traditional workouts without severely modifying them and feeling as if I wasn't getting a good workout.

I strongly urge anyone who enjoys working out with weights and interval training to purchase this set. There is no choreography, so for those of us who shy away from that...these are for you. Her workouts really target those problem areas when pregnant.

Some reviewers have had problems with the music and her voice being annoying, but I for the most part haven't really cared. After a while doing any workout video, I usually grab my ipod and listen to it while following the video. To me, it is all about the content and how effective the workout is. These are highly effective workouts!

I also purchased the postnatal workout, and boy is it amazing too! They come in four 10 minute workouts that are awesome. Joy knows where we struggle packing on the weight while pregnant and really targets those areas in her pregnancy and postpartum videos. I look and feel the best 2 months postpartum than with any of my other children.

I really liked how she puts emphasis on strengthening your pelvic floor in preparation for childbirth and in her postpartum dvds.

As a side note, I had an ordering issue (all on MY END, not theirs) and Joy was AMAZING!!! She got back to me quickly and was efficient and kind. I would do business with her again.

Bottom line, you aren't gonna be disappointed with these.",1362355200,2,1498,4.57089552238806

5070218,5,B0079QDAFK,"I just did my first exercise with this video and I'm hooked.  Not only am I hooked but I feel great!  The girl who does this video is amazing too....I wasn't sure what size ball I needed or if the size ball would change being pregnant.  I did a search and found her website.  I contacted her with the question and less than a day later I had a detailed response back from her.  I was so shocked, and so happy.  So back to the video.  It's not very hard for anyone who is not the workout pro.  And for those who are its for you too.  There are variations in her workouts to accommodate everyone.  The scenery is very relaxing.  I love how it isn't a generic pregancy video, and its broken into trimester.  I have a boost in self esteem, feel like I want to eat better, and feel like this will be a great addition to my pregnancy.

I've only done the second trimester workouts since I ordered at about 13 weeks pregnant.  I was/am active pre-pregnancy, running and playing volleyball, so I didn't want a dvd that would be a waste of my time with lots of stretching, etc.  The second trimester dvd is great for your quads, your shoulders and upper back.  I'm looking forward to seeing what Joy brings to the third trimester workout.  I also like that the workouts aren't too long or too short.  Thirty minutes is perfect for me as my almost two-year-old ""does"" the workouts with me.  (And runs around, too.)  I'd recommend this dvd to anyone who was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy!",1361750400,,744,4.625954198473282

All of them seemed to treat the pregnant body as something fragile and the exercises were no more fun or challenging than a slow walk at the mall!. Joy provides a challenging, efficient and fun workout with a lot of variety and room for modifications. I really appreciated the fact that her manner is so encouraging and genuine, and I found it very easy to stay motivated because I looked forward to each and every workout. The exercises are so well designed that they really work the pregnant body in an efficient, challenging and safe way. Love these workouts, and I also feel like I will be getting more than my money's worth because they will be challenging enough to use after baby comes.

5070221,5,B0079QDAFK,I never leave a review - but I love this workout so much I just had to.  I started at the 2nd trimester workout - I did P90X and insanity my first trimester.  This instructor is encouraging and supportive but does not talk too much which is important to me.  If you haven't worked out before that is fine she will get you through it.  Don't waste your time or money getting any other video - this will prepare you well for labor and delivery and for you to bounce back to after delivery.  I am 23 weeks and do it 3 times a week.  I feel so powerful when I am done working out.  My husband does insanity and P90 and does this with me and he gets a great workout too.  You will need weights and a exercise ball.  The workout is set in a desert vs a set and its so nice to look at the background while working out - I live in MA and this is great and so encouraging.  I researched a lot of videos and this is the best.  The workout are short so if you cant get through a long workout you can do 1 or 2 workouts and there is an express workout.  Dont read anymore reviews get this one.,1360368000,,1081,3.8858447488584473

Joy is NOT annoying like most workout instructors - she's the perfect mix of perky, sweet, and motivating. Her first trimester workout really keeps my heart thumping and my muscles burning, which I appreciate since I'm used to Jillian Michaels workouts. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who actually wants to maintain their muscle tone and cardiovascular health while pregnant. Of course there are days I just can't peel myself off the couch, but there's something so motivating about Joy's dvd that I actually look forward to my workout most days after work.",1359331200,,685,4.913793103448276

They are worth every penny!  Each DVD has 2 work outs and an express work out- so it's nice to be able to have variety and change it up.  I was a former Jillian Michaels advocate before I got pregnant and Joy's work outs are DEFINITELY  challenging, get my heart rate up AND make me break a sweat.

5070228,5,B0079QDAFK,"I really enjoy this DVD for many reasons. I have several different pregnancy workout DVDs and this one is my favorite when I have high levels of energy and really want to feel fulfilled after my workout.

Pros:
Beautiful setting on the beach. The atmosphere alone gives you an extra boost of energy
Cute, fun instructor. She is full of energy and isn't annoying (although she tends to raise her voice a bit to be heard over the waves)
Tough workout moves that will get you sweating. You can modify the moves if you are feeling extra tired and need to tone-down your workout.
TONING moves that will make you very sore the next day!

Cons:
I really can't think of any, except for the fact that the instructor raises her voice too much at times.

5070229,3,B0079QDAFK,"I bought these DVDs because the reviews made it seem like these were made for people who were used to hard-core workouts before pregnancy. I thought other DVDs were for people who wanted to start working out while pregnant, and I've been working out regularly (on my own and with a trainer) for years. I am in my first trimester now, so I've only done the first DVD. I have to say,  I'm impressed with the exercises. I feel like I get a really good workout, and right now, it's the only half-hour of the day when I'm not nauseous. That being said, I find Joy to be extremely ""cutesy"" and annoying. In the warm-up, when she says, ""Let's add some hammies!"" (i.e., hamstring curls), I want to scream! And at one point, she loses her balance and says ""whoopsies!""  Now that I've done the DVD a couple of times and am familiar with the workouts, I find it's much better for my peace of mind to mute the DVD and play some music instead. It's for this reason that I have to give it three stars - I'm still looking for another great pregnancy workout with an instructor that doesn't annoy me so much.",1356566400,10,1092,4.321951219512195

It is also nice because she is pregnant as well...about 12 weeks in the First Trimester, 22 weeks in the Second Trimester and somewhere around 30 in the Third.  She is also very encouraging and supportive.  She also includes a lot of great labor exercises in the Third Trimester DVD.  She does circuit training that focuses on doing a lot of joint movements targeting big muscles and small muscles at the same time as well as some cardio.

Around 5 years ago, the last time I was in the market for prenatal workouts, the selection was pretty dreary for the advanced exerciser (Lindsay Brin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Brin-s-Complete-Pregnancy-4-DVD-Workout-Set-Cardio-Toning-PLUS-Yoga/dp/B000YA4F2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Brin's Complete Pregnancy 4-DVD Workout Set: Cardio, Toning PLUS Yoga</a>&nbsp;was the only reasonable workout I could find).  This workout is better.

I did not use the first trimester dvd because I did my regular workouts during the first trimester and up until around 19 weeks.  I started this workout at the second timester.

This workout is suitable for the advanced exerciser who would like to remain in shape throughout her pregnancy.  I would not recommend this to the person who has not been a consistent exerciser.  This is a circuit-training workout with weights that works both upper body and lower body.  For each trimester, there is 2 routines and 1 express routine.  The full-length routines are approximatel 20 minutes in length.  There is a cool-down and a warm-up per trimester.  There is also some light ab work.  I would have preferred more ab work.

Body by Trimester requires an exercise ball and light and heavy weights.

The instructor was knowledgeable and reasonably energetic and perky without being annoying.  The pace of the exercises was done well and a lot of attention was paid to proper form.  The workouts in this dvd were the closest to my typical workouts (I prefer taking bootcamp classes and working out at home to Cathe, Bob Harper, Jackie Warner, and Jillian Michaels).  The exercises went between strength training to cardio work.  There were a lot of lunges, squats, and upper body work.  There was also some plyometrics (yeah!). I have been doing the two routines together for one approximately 50 minute workout.  So right now, I have 3 decent prenatal workouts:  Lindsay Brin, Perfect Pregnancy workout volume 1, and this one.

If you are an advanced exerciser who wants a challenging prenatal, this is the most difficult one I have found.  Highly recommend!",1352678400,34,2578,5.8133333333333335

5070236,5,B0079QDAFK,"I ""blame"" Body by Trimester, Joy Southworth & my new gluten free diet for the best, healthiest pregnancy of my 5 at 40 years old. I gained strength, endurance and only 10lbs. My baby was 7lbs, 11oz and is doing great.

Not only did Body by Trimester give me a healthy pregnancy, but my delivery was smooth and uncomplicated. Best of all: less than two weeks postpartum, and I am down 22lbs. That's 12lbs LESS than my pre-pregnancy weight, so Joy's contention that the workouts will help you bounce back from pregnancy quicker also holds true.

I liked the variety of three workouts for each trimester. Joy is encouraging and motivating without being irritating.

Buy these DVDs and then do the workouts the 3 days a week as suggested and see for yourself how awesome you can be! Heck, do them 2 days a week and I bet you'd still see great results.

5070237,5,B0079QDAFK,"I bought a few workouts very early in my pregnancy and Body by Trimester is the only one I religiously stick to three + days a week and ran or walked (when running was off the table) the other days.  The videos felt like a real work out.  I found that with a lot of other pregnancy workouts that there was so much emphasis on stretching, but not weight training.  As an avid runner and P90x/Insanity loyalist - those videos just didn't do it for me.  I really wanted something that I would keep my body in shape during this time and that when I was done I would feel like I worked out.  I found that Body by Trimester really did that for me.

I also found that Joy did NOT annoy me.  Some other workouts there is too much chatter and it gets on my nerves, but I did not feel that way with this set.  So that was a big plus.

I really liked how it is broken down by trimester.  It helps with how your body changes and also keeps you from getting bored.  There are three workouts per trimester - two regular and an express.  The regular work outs are under 30 minutes - so it is a perfect amount of time.  The workouts themselves are brokendown into ""super set"" circuits which really keep you moving and they end with ab work, breathing/stretching and kegels.  It was just enough of everything.  I often would do a regular + part of the express if I was feeling really good.  Also, a plus for me, after a week or two into a new trimester workout - I will have the moves memorized and watch regular TV while I do them.

I highly recommend these videos for those who are looking for a good workout.  I plan to buy her post-natal work out.",1348790400,,1634,4.133333333333334

I really believe that this is one of the best workout DVD series out there for pregnant athletically inclined women and I feel it was well worth the investment. I started having sore hips when I sleep a few weeks back and the workouts in the 3rd trimester DVD have allowed me longer sleep periods without aches at night after I do the workout in the morning.

I used to do very intense workouts before I got pregnant and Body by Trimester is perfect for people who are currently in great physical shape. Joy is awesome to listen too, she's very informative and she encourages you to keep a strong workout but at the same time, taking breaks if you need it, constantly reminding you to breath and drink water.

5070244,5,B0079QDAFK,"Pre-pregnancy on a typical week I'd be sweating along to one of Jillian Michael's DVDs or P90x. So finding a GOOD prenatal DVD was very important to me. Prior to becoming pregnant, I did a lot of research- watched a lot of clips on YouTube. To me, a lot of prenatal workout DVD previews I saw lacked the challenge I was seeking. Then I found Body by Trimester and knew it would be a must buy.

I purchased Body by Trimester the week I found out I was pregnant. I've been following Joy's workouts since about week six of pregnancy. I LOVE these workouts! I exercise first thing in the morning and Joy's personality is bubbly, motivating and not mention she is adorable. I never feel irritated or annoyed by listening to the same workout every week. Joy's workouts are a series of supersets that are targeted towards the areas that have the most change during pregnancy. You'll get a full range of muscle exercises: from shoulders, to back, to legs, to abs! Plus these workouts are about 30 minutes long including the warm up. Each DVD has a warmup, two full length workouts, an express workout (15 min), abdominal exercises and how to test for diastasis recti.

I'm currently on the second trimester DVD- I was totally surprised to see traveling pushups and one minute planks!  I found through these workouts I've used muscles that didn't get much attention before. There are days that I feel the burn afterwards! Joy recently launched a post-natal DVD which I'm totally buying. I've read good reviews about it and after experiencing her prenatal DVD first hand- I'm sure it will be a winner too!

Buy this series, you will not be disappointed!",1340150400,80,1643,4.655172413793103

5070246,5,B0079QDAFK,"When I became pregnant, I purchased a few prenatal workout DVDs.  I became discouraged when most of them were not helping me with symptoms of pregnancy.  In fact, sometimes after a workout, I felt as though it would have served me better to sit on the couch.  I was very active before becoming pregnant, and these workouts felt like I was doing nothing at all.

I purchased Body by Trimester after seeing rave reviews on the internet.  The workouts did not disappoint me.  I was working up a good sweat and a good heart rate, even becoming sore the next day (wasn't expecting that after my encounter with other prenatal workouts).  Joy's positive attitude is contagious and keeps me coming back to these workouts every other day.  Not only that, I am motivated to work out because overall, I don't feel pregnant.  I feel like myself, just with a growing belly.  Additionally, I have kept myself from gaining too much weight.  I'm still fitting into my pre-pregnancy clothes!

Body by Trimester is a godsend to my pregnancy - when people ask me how I stay looking so great during such a body-trying time, I tell them it's this workout.  I will keep recommending this to anyone I encounter.  I can't say enough great things about it.  My only regret is not having come across this sooner.

Thank you to Joy for making my pregnancy enjoyable.  This is my first baby, and I went into this feeling scared and unsure.  Now, 21 weeks into my pregnancy, I feel more confident and I'm staying in shape, all because of Joy's hard work in bringing this to us pregnant women who were desperate for a decent prenatal workout.

5070248,5,B0079QDAFK,"I am editing this review post baby.

I had to have an unplanned C-section and both doctors performing the surgery commented on the quality of my ab muscles.  They wanted to know what I did to get ""those ab muscles.""  I am not a hard-core fitness guru.  But I like to stay in shape.  Considering two doctors who have seen innumerable ab muscles while performing C-sections asked me what I did to get the abs that I have...I think its safe to say that Joy gives you the tools you need to stay in shape.  By the way, I am by no means a ""small person"", pre-pregnancy I was 170lbs and 5 foot 10 inches (US size 12).

Also, I can't believe some people find her irritating!  Clearly these people have not experienced a variety of instructors, as there are far far more irritating instructors out there.  Furthermore, I think it is difficult to qualify irritating, as everyone has their own personal pet-peeves.  But as far as I am concerned, she is great.  No pressure to over-perform, general great attitude.  I guess my only complaint is the production quality.  I would have preferred a sound stage - it often seems like she is yelling over noise in the background since they filmed outdoors.

Below is my original review:

First pregnancy and I bought three workout DVDs: Summer Sanders, 10 min Solutions Prenatal Pilates and this set.  Although this is the most expensive, its the biggest bang for your buck; you get two 30 min workouts and one express workout per trimester.  The workouts seem to fly by faster than the other DVDs and its the kind of intensity I wanted.  Furthermore, I get bored really easily with DVD workouts, but I find myself looking forward to Joy's workouts.  Her general attitude is great, she is supportive and informative.  In my third trimester and still enjoying this DVD set.  Highly recommend.",1334620800,,1823,4.634375
5070249,5,B0079QDAFK,This series is a must have for any pregnant woman of any fitness level.

8512960,5,B0079QDAFK,"First of all I have to say that I have never written a review on amazon before (although I use amazon reviews before making just about any purchase :) I have purchased the majority of my workout dvds from amazon.com and these dvds range from Jillian Michaels to Insanity to Gaiam yoga dvds. I LOVE exercise and have exercised for about 10 years before becoming pregnant. I also love running, biking, and swimming as forms of cardio. I also have some hand weights and other equipment at home that this dvd requires.

After I became pregnant for the first time, I quickly realized how I was unable to keep up with my typical Jillian Michaels intensity level workouts. I instantly panicked because I thought I wouldn't be able to do anything for exercise during pregnancy since I felt so rotten. I was depressed reading other women's posts about how they continued with their normal exercise all through their pregnancy. I thought something was seriously wrong with me! And I was always worried that I was going to hurt the baby somehow.

I read some reviews about pregnancy dvds and I bought some such as Summer Sanders prenatal workout (which i did once and didn't really care for it) as well as Erin O'Brien's workout (also did once and didn't care for it). I didn't find this dvd until later in my first trimester and all I can say is I wish I had found it sooner!! If I could personally write Joy a letter of how grateful I am she produced such a great prenatal workout, I would in a heartbeat. The quality is great, the intensity level is perfect (for me at least) and I never once got bored. I thought maybe since she only had 2 workouts for each trimester including an express workout for each trimester that I might get bored, but that never happened. Right when I felt like I was getting a little used to the workouts, I graduated to the next trimester workouts! Joy is upbeat and encouraging, and I look forward to these every morning. I actually rotate her workouts 1 and 2 every other day, but I do the express one each time so it makes the workouts a little longer. I personally like to workout longer than 30 minutes a day, so when doing them together it gave me about a 50 minute workout. I am in my third trimester now so I may be getting more tired and just doing 30 minutes a day! On the other days that I don't do her dvd, I usually use my spin bike at home or go walking on the treadmill as I stopped being able to run early in my pregnancy.

I'm not sure if anyone else has explained how the workouts are structured so I will try and do it quickly. The workouts are structured in about 3 (sometimes 4) segments and also include a cool down that has abdominal toning and labor preparation exercises (for the third trimester). You do 2 sets of each exercise and they are mostly compound exercises. For example, she'll have you do a lunge forward with a bicep curl, and then a shoulder press when you step back. After doing that on each leg (Joy guides you in the number of reps), she'll have you do some sort of cardio such as squat kicks or squat hops (she gives the option to modify and skip the hopping). Then you repeat that circuit again. Once you do it twice, you move on to the next set of exercises. It is perfectly paced, although I did have to pause it frequently to catch my breath and drink water. She tells you to stay between a 4 and 6 intensity level (if 10 is the highest). So if ever I felt it was more than that, I would pause it and take a little breather :)

If I could give this dvd more than 5 stars I would. I will recommend this dvd to everyone who asks me about exercise during pregnancy! I will even use these after the baby comes, because I feel like they will ease me back into my normal routine. I know Joy has a postnatal workout, which I will actually be purchasing as well. I hesitated at first to buy this dvd because of the price, but you actually get 3 different dvds. It is also WELL worth the money. Please don't hesitate to buy this dvd.... you won't regret it :) As far as weight gain goes, I am almost 30 weeks pregnant and I have gained 15 pounds. I don't know if that's high or low (I try not to obsess about the scale) but I can attribute it not being overwhelmingly higher to using Joy's dvds. I didn't only do them for weight management tho. I've always struggled with body image issues (what girl hasn't!!) but I wanted to stay in shape and stay healthy for the baby. Labor (from what I've heard) is the most intense and physically challenging event of a woman's life, so why wouldn't we train for it just like we would anything else?

If you like exercising with weights and circuit style training, you will absolutely love this dvd. I guarantee it :)",1456444800,7,4715,4.30518018018018
