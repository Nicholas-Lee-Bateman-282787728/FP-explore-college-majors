2824953,5,B000PKG6SA,"Football has the Super Bowl, baseball has the World Series, hockey has the Stanley Cup and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment has always had WrestleMania.  Total Nonstop Action's biggest show of the year is Bound For Glory & this year, they delievered not only their best one yet...but their best overall top to bottom event in over a year.

Ultimate X Match: LAX vs. XXX - Eventhough their names together sounds like an eyechart, this was an awesome opener as the Ultimate X match usually always delievers when it comes to crazy spots.  Moments to look out for were Elix Skipper doing a cross bodyblock off the top of the structure onto Hernandez, Skipper getting a neckbreaker from the top of the ropes, and Senshi doing the ""Warriors Way"" double stomp onto Hernandez who was hanging from the tree of woe at that time.  Great opener.

Fight For Your Right Match: Before I get started, what the hell is Kip James wearing?  It looks like he raided Torrie Wilson's closet.  Anyways, this starts as a reverse battle royal in which you had to get yourself INTO the ring from the arena floor, when 8 get into the ring it becomes a normal battle royal, and when you get down to the final two...pinfall or submission.  Concidering how horrible the last one they did was, this one was tons better since they got the stage one ""reverse battle royal"" part over pretty quickly eventhough you still caught parts where wrestlers (like Lance Hoyt) just standing & looking around instead of actually trying to get into the ring.  The rest of the match was fun to watch as most ""multiman"" TNA matches are.

TNA Tag Team Champions Team Pacman vs. AJ Styles & Tomko - Pacman didn't wrestle (when again, did he ever wrestle) so a substitute named Consequences Creed (who dressed like Apollo Creed from the original ""Rocky"" movie) took his place...and good thing too because this match surely surpassed any original expectations had knowing that Pacman was in the match.  Having never seen Creed before, he was the shock of the match as he was able to hold his own in this match while the other three as well meshed well together for a good performance.  The ""make it rain"" ending involving Pacman & Earl Hebner along with Don West comment (which was pathetic knowing the whole ""strip club"" situation that got Pacman in trouble by the NFL in the first place) is the only negative I can say here.

X Division Champion Jay Lethal vs. Christopher Daniels - This was a good back & forth X division match with the story in the end being that it took Jay Lethal breaking away from his ""Macho Man"" offense & using his own ""Lethal Combination"" to get the victory here.  One of the best X division title matches in recent months.

2 out of 3 Tables Match: Steiner Brothers vs. Team 3D - This was a straight out brawl between these two & concidering how dull their ""wrestling"" match was back at Hard Justice, that's a good thing.  They mostly brawled on the floor in the beginning before settling it into the ring.  The Motor City Machine Guns interfered in the end but if you watched Impact, you would know why they did.  Overall a good brawl & tons better than their previous encounter.

TNA Knockouts Gauntlet - This was an average match up as these guantlet's (like the Fight For Your Right earlier) are usually crowed so not everyone has a chance to standout & make an impression.  Some moments to look out for were Amazing Kong's domination including destroying Christy Hemme, the final moments between Gail Kim & Roxxi, and Amazing Kong's ""wardrobe malfunction"" (this will probably be censored or edited out the DVD release).  Good match for what it was.

Samoa Joe vs. Christian Cage with Matt Morgan as the special enforcer - This was the match of the night as these two have just awesome chemistry in the ring together as shown in their previous two matches (Destination X & No Surrender).  Morgan only got involved to chase off Styles & Tomko.  I can't put into words this match as it's a wrestling clinic...just like always with these two.

Monsters Ball: Abyss vs. Rhino vs. Black Reign vs. Raven - This was the best Raven looked in over a year in this hardcore match.  One moment to look for, if you were a fan of the previous matches between Raven & Rhino, is the role reversal involving the shopping cart that you'll get a kick out of along with the ending of Raven getting slammed shirtless into both thumbtacks & glass.  This was an enjoyable weapons match but not the best Monster's Ball that's been done to date.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Sting - Before the match, the reception Sting got in the town that made him famous (Atlanta...home of WCW/NWA) was one of the biggest pops I've heard in recent memory.  The match started off slow with no men looking off a little bit, it went into a good match between these two with Kurt pulling off an sick looking & impressive 450 off the top rope into a kneedrop at one point.  Both Karen Angle & Kevin Nash (but you knew that was coming based off the skits all night) got involved in the end but it didn't take away the match between these two as Sting won & once again walked away from Bound For Glory as a champion.

Overall, there were a few minor flaws but the good heavily outweighed & overshadowed the bad on this occassion.  This was a fun PPV to watch as TNA put forth their best effort & delivered an event for their company worthy of the title ""biggest show of the year.""  I recommend, no questioned asked.",1194739200,5,5459,4.549079754601227
2824954,5,B000PKG6SA,"Before i begin the reveiw i  would like to say that i saw this on pay per veiw and it was the best wrestling show i ever saw.

The matches include-

1.) LAX vs. XXX- This match was an ultimate x match and was a really good opener. I wouldn't say that it was the best ever ultimate x but it was pretty good and had some high spots. 8/10

2.) 15 Man Fight For The Right- In this match 16 men start out outside of the ring and the objective is to be one of the 8 men aloud in the ring by jumping in the ring. then it is over the top rope elimination until the last 2 men then you win by pinfall or submision- This match is an ok match with some good spots to watch for. 7/10

3.)A.J. Styles and Tomko (Christians Coilition) vs. Team Pacman- This match is for the TNA Tag Team Championship. they only thing is there is a man named rusheed lucious creed who substitutes for Pacman Jones, but Pacman is at ringside. This match is actually a good tag title bout and the ending is just absolutely hialrious. 7.5/10

4.) Black Machismo (Jay Lethal) vs. Christopher Daniels- This match is for the X Division Championship- this is a good X Division with a lot of near falls. 8/10

5.) The Steiner Brother vs. Team 3D- This is a 2/3 tables in which you have to put the opposing team through 2 tables to win the match- I really enjoyed this match with some good brawling through the crowd and a good ending. 9/10

6.) 10 Knockout Gauntlet- This match is for the first ever TNA Womens Championship- What happens is 2 Knockouts start in the ring then every minute another one comes out and the way to win is to show the opposing knockout over the top rope. Then when it gets down to 2 Knockouts then you ahve to win by pinfall or submission. This match was a lot better of a womens match than wwe could ever put on. This was a good match but seemed pretty quik.

7.) Samoa Joe vs. Christian Cage- This match had Matt Morgan as the special enforcer- Call me crazy but this match reminded me a lot about something that ring of honor (roh) would put on. This match was just great and had some really cool spots and this was a job well done by both of these men. 10/10

8.) Abyss vs. Black Reign vs. Raven vs. Rhyno- This match is a monsters ball match where anything is legal- I really liked this match because their were some many hardcore spots and high risk moves it was hard to take your eyes off of it. Although i expected more tables to be used but this match was still very good. 10/10

9.) Sting vs. Kurt Angle- This match is for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship- After many weeks of seeing kurt angle and sting just wanting to get at each other we finally see it and what a match it was. This match will definately go down in the record books as one of the best. This match also had a lot of twists and turns, such as you didn't know who was going to win, sometimes it seemed like Sting then Kurt Angle and back and forth. But over-all this match was good and had some interference 11/10

Well there you have it Bound For Glory 2007 and i'd say it is worth every penny. So i suggest you get it now!!!!!",1193961600,4,3099,4.12106135986733
2824955,4,B000PKG6SA,"Ghetto Brawl: Team 3D vs. L.A.X. - This was your typical TNA weapons brawl that went all over the arena filled with trashcans, cookie trays, and everything except the kitchen sink.  It was spiced up with some cameos from former LAX member Machete, Johnny Rotz, Alex Shelley, along with large group of both ""Latino nation"" members & ""Devon's brothers from Brooklyn.""  Overall, it was exactly what the match title is...a brawl & it was enjoyable.  Also during this match, listen for Don West's line of ""The only person we're missing is Pacman Jones.""  How ironic is that line months later?

Double Bullrope Match: Petey Williams & Gail Kim vs. James Storm & Jackie Moore - Thankfully, they didn't use the ""touch four (or in this case, six) turnbuckles"" rule that usually makes bullrope/strap matches horrible.  The girls were just outside for the most part beating the hell out of each other with Gail having Jackie tied to the post & chopping the hell out of him while Storm & Williams fought in the ring.  One comedic moment to look out for was when Storm tied Williams' feet to the rope & went for a pinfall but the ref wouldn't count it because...well, his feet were on the ropes.  The match was enjoyable for what it was.

Crossface Chicken Wing Match: Senshi vs. Austin Starr - Another good encounter here as Senshi & Starr both work groundbased wrestling instead of the highspots style so it was a good clash.  Bob Backlund's is around during the match but he doesn't distract from the match.  The only downfall I could see is that you know how the match is going to end, again...it's a good encounter & showcasing of the X division.

VKM vs. Heartbreakers - The match was just like the prematch promo & entire fued with Christy Hemme, it was a crap.  Skip it.

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: X Division Champion Chris Sabin vs. Jerry Lynn - Unfortunally, something happened in the crowd during this match that seemed to distract from this match as Lynn, Sabin, and the referee even looked over & got distracted from their match in the beginning.  I hate to be repetative but this was a good showing of what the X division is capable of with those two doing some great mat wrestling, high flyin', high impact moves, and quite a few near falls.  Great encounter with two men who don't disappoint in the ring with each other.

Elevation X Match: Rhino vs. A.J. Styles - Usually, scaffold matches are just people punching & kicking each other back & forth on a small platform while the fans are just waiting for someone to fall off.  However, this one was unique in that they pulled off some moves that you wouldn't expect like Rhino goring AJ or Styles climbing inside the steel structure under the platforms.  This is one of the very few scaffold matches where the match on the scaffold itself wasn't boring & had you just waiting for someone to drop.

Kurt Angle vs. Scott Steiner - This was a high impact match in the sense that they used more power stiff-like moves like than anything else.  Strong irish whips, suplexes, and stiff looking clotheslines summerize this match in a nutshell.  If you can get past the very weak ending, it's a good match for the standards of a Scott Steiner match.

Last Rites Match: Sting vs. Abyss - This was a glorified casket match but the catch is that the casket is lowered from the ceiling (complete with special lighting & smoke as it's lowered) and you must put your opponent in it & have it raised back up to the ceiling.  With fake tombstones & electic candelabras surrounding the ring, this was a wrestlecrap match in the making right alongside WWE's Kennell From Hell & WCW's Chamber Of Horrors.  I'll give it some credit as Sting took a chokeslam right ontop of the casket that dented the top of it (which got the only positive reaction from the crowd thoughout the whole match) along with being busted open & bled buckets like I haven't seen for as long as I can remember...including the WCW days.  This honestly was just one of those enjoyable trainwrecks...don't know how else to put it.

NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe - With the exception of the Kurt Angle series, Joe's first World Title match saw him & Christian deliver the wrestling clinic that we haven't seen since his X division days.  Back & forth action, counter for counter, plenty of nearfalls, and really just kept you on the edge of your set with the ending having you begging for a rematch.  This was a definate TNA Match of the year canidate and match of the night.

(DVD Bonus Match) Ladder Match: Jerry Lynn vs. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Austin Starr vs. Senshi - This was from Impact and honestly, it wasn't much past a 5-6 min. spotfest between all 5 men as the ladder didn't come into play until the last two minutes.  The match was too short to have anything to note.

(DVD Bonus Match) Gauntlet for the Gold Battle Royal: This was a gauntlet battle royal (Royal Rumble style) with Samoa Joe winning & gaining his title shot.  There really isn't anything noteworthy here as well.

Overall, most of the wrestling & gimmick matches delievered as the card was solid (not perfect) from top to bottom.  As another reviewer said, this isn't TNA's best effort but it's far from their worst so I recommend.",1191369600,,5233,4.5663811563169165
2824956,3,B000PKG6SA,"This dvd had an amazing main event, Cage VS Joe but the rest of the PPV was alright. Sting VS Abyss was probably the second best match on the card but the ending was a bit of a stretch. I think scaffold matches are boring, so Rhino VS Styles really wasn't all that great for me. Angle and Steiner is an average match that could have been seen in WWE a few years back, expect for the six sided ring. Ghetto Brawl was a going alright until the end when all the ""gang"" members entered and started to brawl. The bonus matches are great too.",1186531200,,536,4.114285714285714
2824957,5,B000PKG6SA,"Ive seen every TNA Pay Per Views, and this is one of my favorites. The card didn't seem too strong, but as usual TNA surprises and delivers. I used to be a long time WWE and TNA fan, but after this PPV put the final nail in WWE's coffin, I will never again buy a WWE PPV as they have all been disappointing lately. Any company that tries to push a douche, like John Cena, and ruins what ECW once used to be, needs, and already is, slowly being put to rest. Its sad cause Ive been watching WWE since 1988, but they've gone downhill more then ever, and its time for their legacy to die.

X DIVISION MATCH: Senshi vs. Austin Starr (9 out of 10)
I was not surprised at how good this match was, two amazing, former ROH wrestlers in a classic X Division match.

GHETTO BRAWL MATCH: The Latin American Xchange vs. Team 3D
(7.5 out of 10)
This match was pretty good, I don't normally like brawl style matches. But these guys are the best brawlers out there, so it was alright.

X DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Chris Sabin vs. Jerry Lynn (8 out of 10)
Lynn has finally shaken off the ring rust from being out of the game for so long, and was able to put on a good show with Sabin.

GRUDGE MATCH: Kurt Angle vs. Scott Steiner (8.5 out of 10)
WOW! I was very surprised with this one. Ive always thought Steiner was very boring, but he and Angle really put on a show. Steiner is on his second run in TNA and has been very impressive since his return. This is the first of Steiners matches, where I was actually disappointed that it ended too early, and that is the only flaw in this match. I would have rated it higher if it was just a bit longer.

LAST RITES MATCH: Sting vs. Abyss (8.5 out of 10)
Excellent match, would be a 9.5 out of 10, if the set wasn't so cheesy. Sting is another wrestler that has really improved after moving to TNA. This match was great, lots of action, some great bumps. The whole set they put up for the match was just dumb and made me laugh a bit, on the plus side though Abyss and Sting destroy the set during the match.

ELEVATION X MATCH: Rhino vs. AJ Styles (7.5 out of 10)
I liked this match, I just wasn't too impressed with the concept of elevation X. Ive never been a fan of scaffold matches, because they are usually very quick and have only one short but big bump at the end. This is the best scoffold match I've ever seen though, AJ and Rhino manage too keep the match interesting with good use of the scaffold.

NWA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE MATCH:
Christina Cage vs. Samoa Joe (10 out of 10)
WHAT THE F*CK!!! This match just seemed kinda thrown together, and ended up being an instant match of the year candidate. These wrestlers are both amazing, but there wasn't alot of hype during the weekly shows, and there styles just didn't seem to mesh well, so I wasn't expecting much. Also this match started at about 2.5 hours into the PPV, most PPVs end at about 2.75 hours, so I was expecting a short match with some kind of bogus interference ending. How wrong I was. This match took up the rest of the time slot, 30 minute match. Even though the build up for the match on the weekly shows was weak, when these two locked eyes all the excellent ring psychology began to show. Cage and Joe mixed it up so well. After the first 5 minutes I was on the edge of my seat. The crowd was on their feet the whole time, yelling ""This Is Awesome!"" This is a must see match for any true pro wrestling fan.

If you are a fan of pro wrestling I recommend this DVD. If you are a fan TNA wrestling, this is a MUST own.",1183248000,,3528,4.155197657393851
2824960,5,B000PKG6SA,"First I want to say that this is one of those dvd's that make you just so pumped and I really feel like when we saw these matches they just made the show pefect

1. Ultimate X LAX vs XXX
  I think that this is the best opener they could have picked but tna usually don't pick the best opener but this one is near pefect. The spots were great but the wrestling was cool also with hotstuff killing skipper and senshi most of the time and the cross body block from the top of the tower that held the X ropes was sick 9/10 (but still not as cool as the rana of the cage in 2005 but skipper really rules!!)

2. Fight For the Right
  I didn't like the inside out battle royal because it was just sorta a sloppy mess. But when the 8 get in the ring the match picks up and the match got pretty good I thought it was nice to see the guys who were in the battle royal in it but I wish Storm wouldn't have gotten screwed but he beat the winner on impact ha ha 7.5/10

3. World Tag Team Title Team Pacman vs Tomko and Aj Styles
  It was great when pacman couldn't wrestle because Creed made his debut and did great aj and tomko do great during the match and Creed makes the best debut ever with maybe the best showing and Ron Killing didn't impress but he can't any more because he does the same moves in every match 8/10

4. X Division Title Jay Lethal vs Christopher Daniels
  This is one of the best matches of the night. These two really tried hard to put on the best match and came close to it if they had the same time as sting and angle I think they would have. Daniels hit the BME and the Angel's Wings. Lethal hits the elbow drop and the Lethal Combonation so who wins it? 10/10

5. Tables Match Steiners vs Team 3D
  This is better than there match at hard justice. (which I didn't hate that match) They start on the outside and then move to the ring and the spots start coming. It was easy to tell who would win but it was fun to watch the match anyway. I love all the table Spots in this one and Rick looks pretty good for being so old. 7.75/10 (and sting is even older than him)

6. Knockouts Title Battle Royal
  All the girls get good spots in this one and it is a very good womens match better than wwe puts on all the time everyone looks good but not Christy Hemme I mean she looked good in her attire but then she was killed by Awesome Kong will Kong destroy them all? 8.25/10

7. Matt Morgan as enforcer Samoa Joe vs Christian Cage
  This is one of the best matches I have seen these matches just keep being awesome in there own ways that is why this is the second best ppv ever. (second only to that AAA ppv which was there only one but was just great) These to just put on one of the best 15 min Wrestling shows ever the moves flowed and were perfect. 10/10

8. Monsters Ball Black Reign vs Rhino vs Abyss vs Raven
  Let me start off by saying I hate Black Reign I wish Dustin Rhodes would retire he is just boring, I mean Shattered Dreams to Raven in Monsters Ball and to make it worse I heard this is the last Monsters Ball. The match was good I wish it was a Three way though and that Raven would win his first Monster's ball but no he is pinned again(every year) pretty good and better than the first but not like the second and third 8.25/10

9. World Heavyweight Title Sting vs Kurt Angle
  This match is just history the first time one on one and the title is on the line. The match is set up perfect it is like the main event of wrestlemania 24 perfect and slow then we get to the good spots and then a great finish. When the Stinger has the belt after the match I knew he wouldn't hold it long (two days) but I knew it might be his last time (don't think he will beat Joe) but it is probly just great history it makes this a must buy 10/10",1222214400,2,3757,3.974666666666667
2824961,5,B000PKG6SA,"Quite simply the greatest PPV that TNA Wrestling has ever broadcast and possibly the best PPV of 2007 altogether.  Every match on the card is great.  Highlights of this stellar event are Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe, Ultimate X, Knockout Guantlet, X-Division Title, and World Championship match. The crowd was absolutely insane on this show and you could tell that the wrestlers were feeding off of it.  If you haven't seen this PPV, buy this dvd now!!",1220227200,,452,4.8441558441558445
2824962,4,B000PKG6SA,"Destination X was a great ppv in 2007 from TNA. Most of all the matches are great and they all are pretty watchable. This ppv also ended the Sting and Abyss rivalry which took place in a brutal Last Rite's Match. Nearly a 5 Star ppv.

1. Ghetto Street Brawl
Latin American Xchange vs. Team 3D
Pheonomenal opener but I didn't understand why the titles weren't on the line here, but a surperb opening nevertheless. The teams fought all over the building, Team 3D even let some fans get some shots in on LAX. It turned out into an all out riot towards the end of the match with like 20 guys coming out and just fighting the holy hell out of each other. Great opening. Great hardcore action here. Shelly interfers and screws Team 3D. 4.5/5

2. Mixed Tag Team Bull Rope Match
James Storm & Miss Jackie vs. Petey Williams & Gail Kim
This bull rope match was quite interesting. Storm & Jackie gets some cheat shots in the beginning but soon after the tables are turned into Williams & Kim favor. Some pretty good comedic spots as well. The knockouts really dishes out some punishment to each other in this match, I really enjoyed watching this one. 3.5/5

3. Crossface Chicken Wing Match
Austin Starr vs. Senshi
Decent match here but you already know how the match was going to end, you had to win with Backlund's Crossface Chicken Wing in order to win which really didn't gave the the match any suspense but it was sill a pretty good x-division match up. 3.5/5

4. Voodo Kin Mafia vs. The Heartbreakers w/ Christy Hemme
Before the match started, VKM & Christy had a little comedic skit before the match which was a little funny, the BINGO thing was kind of stupid but the match wasn't all that bad. VKM really made this match. Some pretty nice reversals and a few impact moves. Christy interfered but she got hers. Nice tag match. 3/5

5. 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the X-Division Championship
Chris Sabin vs. Jerry Lynn
Terrific match, I was really impressed with Lynns endurance, he can really go out there and still put on a 5 star match. Some great wrestling moves were executed, some great counters and some great x-division action. The falls came at pretty good times as well and this was a great one on one confrontation. Some good outside ring action as well in the beginning. The interference by Daniels didn't hurt the match at all. Great x-division match up. 5/5

6. Elevation X
Rhino vs. AJ Styles
I wasn't really too fond of this match. It was kind of boring to me. But if yall haven't seen this type of match before, it does give you suspense of that someone will actually fall from the Elevated X 20 feet above the ring. Rhino is also able to pull off his Gore on Styles on top of the X but I wasn't really amused by this match. 2.5/5

7. Kurt Angle vs. Scott Steiner
I was impressed by this match too. I thought Steiner wouldn't have been able to do anything because hes so freaking big but he really shocked me. Steiner pulls off some good moves and even applying the olympic slam on Angle which it looked like it broke Angle's neck. The match was more of a brawl than anything but some wrestling moves were used as well. You even get some blood from Steiner. Pretty good match. I enjoyed watching this one too. 4.5/5

8. Last Rites Match
Sting vs. Abyss
This was TNA's version of a casket match. It got brutal at times as well. Abyss and Sting took some brutal shots in this one. Sting takes a viscious shot with the candlestick holder to head while trying to stinger splash Abyss. Sting also takes a hard chokeslam on top of the casket. Pretty violent match but not all that gory or anything of that nature but it was some/what violent. The fans did chant BORING at times but the match wasn't really boring at all. 4/5

9. NWA World Championship
Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe
Pheononemal main event. Cage takes some viscious leg shots in this one by Joe. Some nice reversals and counters in this one. Good outside ring action as well. Cage takes a sickening slam on the floor, then gets taken to the crowd. Some great wrestling and some great brawling. Just some good hard shots in this one mixed in with some nice impacts moves too. Joe even utilizes the crippler crossface in this one which was great to see. Pheonomenal main event. It had a classic end as well. 5/5

Destination X was great. This is a great dvd to add to you collection This is one I defiantly on recommend on getting. Great TNA ppv.",1217376000,,4415,4.3995098039215685

1. Elevation X Match- Destination X
Rhino vs. AJ Styles
I wasn't really to fond of the way this match was set up. I didn't really found it all that good either but Rhino and Styles did their best to have a match on top of the Elevated X above the ring. It does give you suspense if you never seen this type of match before. Rhino does pull off his Gore on top of the Elevated X. 3/5

Now the rules of this match are a little confusing if you read them but they do work out during the match. You must score a pin fall in order to qualify to climb the ladder to hang up the title belt and the loser of the fall must spend 2 minutes in a penalty box. The match was very good. There were some double team moves by Cage & Styles. Also some very good moves were excuted with the ladder. Angle manages to get use of his ankle lock on top of the ladder. Styles gets thrown through the announce table and the impact was just sick, it really looked like Styles broke his back. Awesome match. 5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe
Another pretty good match between these two but I do think the Kurt & Karen thing took away a great deal from the match. It did seem like it dragged on in the beginning but it picked up. Some good submissions and more of a ground mat based wrestling match mixed in with some good high impact moves as well. Pretty good wrestling match and the whole Karen/Kurt thing took away from the match. 4.5/5

This match resembles TNA's version of a Last Man Standing Match but it was a very brutal and bloody match. It starts out in the crowd and some viscious shots were taken out there. Harris takes a brutal chair shot by Storm about midway in the match. There were some good table spots as well. Very brutal match. Good match. 5/5

This was by far the best ladder match in TNA history. Christian really upped his game in this ladder match, & I believed he wanted to show Edge, Michaels, Hardys, & others that he made the ladder match of what it is today and he certainly proved that in this match. Kaz was also great as well, he pulled off moves you rarely don't see in ladder matches these days. Pheonomenal Ladder match & the interference didn't hurt the match at all. 5/5

This match opened up Bound for Glory back in October. This was a great opener. Just a really pheonomenal great match. Some good high flying moves. Skipper pulls off a cross body about 15 feet up from the ultimate x post. A great match. The crowd was really into this one. 5/5

7) TNA World Championship- Bound for Glory
Kurt Angle vs. Sting
This was a great main event from Bound for Glory. Sting and Angle are great competitors and this was just a great match. It was a good ol' solid wrestling match and the interference didn't hurt the match one bit. A great match to say the least. A pure classic. 5/5

This was a great dvd. If yall aint used to the wrestling in TNA or yall missed a majority of TNA from 2007 then I recommend on picking this up. A solid dvd to add to your collection.",1217289600,5,4848,4.236186348862406
2824964,5,B000PKG6SA,"Bound for Glory 2007 was to me the greatest wrestling ppv of 2007 and yes even better than all of the WWE's ppvs. The event was great from beginning to end!!!

1. Ultimate X Match
Senshi & Elix Skipper vs. LAX
What a great opener!!! This match was very fast paced with some great aerial moves from both teams. Skipper pulled off an about 15 foot high cross body onto Hernandez which was an amazing thing to see. An Excellent opener. 5/5

2. Fight for your Right
This match was made to crown a new #1 contender for the world title. 16 men would start on the outside and once 8 men climbed over the top rope, then it would become an eight man over the top battle royal until there were 2 left in the ring and that would then become a pin fall encounter between the 2.

The match itself was great. it had a lot of action taking place everywhere. the motor city machineguns had a good showing and so did eric young as well as kaz. terrific match. 5/5

3. TNA Tag Team Championship
AJ Styles and Tomko vs. Ron ""Truth"" Killings & Consequences Creed
Adam Pacman Jones took himself out of the match so Creed would substitute in his place. Creed and Styles had a good showing in the ring when it came down to just them two. Good brawling from Tomko. Just a good tag team match. 4/5

4. X-Division Championship
""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal vs. ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels
Great x-division match up. good in ring action as well as good outside ring action. Lethal's lower back took some sickening slams onto the guard rail. A good all around match with a good ending. 5/5

5. 2 out of 3 Tables Match
The Steiner Brothers vs. Team 3D
This match was good, I thought it was going to suck but boy ol' boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed this match a great deal. It soon gets taken to the Georgia crowd and gets physical out there. The table spots came at good times and it turned out to be just an awesome match between these two legendary teams. I really loved this one. 4.5/5

6. Gauntlet Match for the TNA Knockout Championship
This was a great showing from the TNA knockouts. There wasn't no girly crying in this one. Mrs. Brooks took some hard shots and also christy hemme got hurt very badly from a power slam by awesome kong which looked like it broked christy's back. just a good womens match. 4/5

7. Samoa Joe vs. Christian Cage with Matt Morgan as the Special Enforcer
They said There MUST be a winner and there was. this was a good third encounter from these two. Christian has really became an all star player since coming to TNA and Joe was excellent from day one. There were some viscious kicks to Christian from Joe in this one. Morgan did a fantastic job as the enforcer. Good showing from both men. Tremendous match!!! 5/5

8. Monster's Ball Match
Abyss vs. Rhino vs. Black Reign vs. Raven
Not the best Monster's Ball match in history but it served its purpose to prepare you for the main event. Raven gets black hole slammed onto broken glass and thumb tacks which gave Abyss his first ever Monster's Ball victory. 3.5/5

9. TNA World Championship
Sting vs. Kurt Angle
To me, this was a dream match. Sting is an icon in the annals of wrestling history and Angle is probably the greatest mat wrestler ever. Just a good match. There were counters, outside ring action, close pin falls, submissions, interference, blood, just a great all around match. A great match to end a great ppv. 5/5

Like i said earlier, Bound for Glory was the ppv to see in 2007 from both TNA and the WWE. I HIGHLY recommend on buying this ppv!!!! You most likely won't be sorry you did.",1213315200,4,3572,4.364457831325301
2824965,5,B000PKG6SA,"Every major company as their own special event. WWF/WWE has always had WrestleMania, WCW had Starrcade but TNA has Bound For Glory & this was without the doubt their best overall event yet.

Ultimate X Match: LAX vs XXX. Don't let the names fool you since this is the most Xs that you would see without having to go to a doctor's office (hey I tried). Awesome opening match as this match always delivers in crazy spots with moments like Senshi doing a stomp to Homocide who was in the tree of woe in the corner from the X, Homocide's impactful neckbreaker from the top of the X, Skipper doing a crossbody off the top of the structure to even Hernandez being impressive for his size as the big man in the match.

Fight For The Right Match. This was a reverse battle royal in which you have to get into the ring, once 8 men are in the ring, the match turns into a regular battle royal. From there, once it gets down to the final two, they have a regular wrestling match. This was a better match than it sounds due the gimmick behind & considering the fact that the casual fan would look at this & go ""WTF?"" but nothing  much past that.

TNA Tag Team Champions Team Pacman vs AJ Styles & Tomko. Once again, Adam ""Pacman"" Jones didn't wrestle so his replacement turned out to be someone named Consequences Creed who dressed up very similar to Apollo Creed from the ""Rocky"" movies. Once again, this was another match that turned out to be better than expected since everyone expected Pacman to wrestle but Creed was quite the performer here while we know to expect a good performance from everyone else resulting a very good tag team match.

X-Division Champion Jay Lethal vs Christopher Daniels. Lethal broke away from his ""Macho Man"" offense & stuck to his Lethal Combination style while Daniels is a great performer when he is allowed to be. A good back & forth battle between two underrated performers & one of the best X-Division title matches that I have seen in TNA.

Tables Match: The Steiner Brothers vs Team 3D. This was actually better than their previous match at Hard Justice as they stuck to the brawling method instead of actually trying to have a wrestling match. They brawled around ringside, in the crowd that lead to both teams using trash cans & even Steiner hitting D-Von with a cup of beer. The ending featured the Motor City Machine Guns getting involved but it didn't take away from what was a good brawl between both teams.

TNA Knockouts Gauntlet Battle Royal. This was to determine the first ever TNA Knockouts Women's Champion. Just your average battle royal with moments like Awesome Kong's dominating performance including her destroying Christy Hemme & even all the knockouts at one point ganging up on her to eliminate her, & the final battle with Gail Kim & Roxxi that lead to Kim becoming the first Women's Champion in TNA history.

Matt Morgan as special enforcer: Samoa Joe vs Christian Cage. Morgan only became a factor at the end to stop interference from Styles & Tomko so this match was allowed to be something. This was my favorite match of the night as anytime that Christian & Joe got at it, they steal the show with an awesome wrestling clinic & this was no exception with the crowd getting heavily into it throughout.

Monster's Ball: Abyss vs Raven vs Rhino vs Black Reign. This wasn't the best one that they have done but it wasn't bad either as they brawled around the arena with moments like Rhino goring a part of the set of the stage, Raven dropping an elbow off the balcony, each man getting busted open at one point, Raven & Rhino reliving their memorable shopping cart sequence & the ending with Raven getting slammed hard onto thumbtacks & glass. Again, not the best but enjoyable.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs Sting. This was a dream match as the ""Icon"" does battled with the only Olympic Gold Medalist in wrestling history. Sting got an awesome reception in Atlanta which was no surprise considering that it was the homebase of WCW/NWA. This match started off slow with both men trying to counter the other but eventually pick up into a great match with Sting putting a better performance than he did the year before along with Angle doing a sick 450 into a kneedrop that was really impressive to watch. With cameos from Kevin Nash & Karen Angle, this main event heavily delivered with Sting once again leaving Bound For Glory as champion.

Overall, I felt that out of all the Bound For Glory cards, this was the best one that they did as TNA really delivered when it came to their biggest show of the year. I would highly recommend this event to any wrestling fan including those just getting into TNA.",1212451200,,4654,4.555023923444976
2824966,5,B000PKG6SA,"LAX VS Triple X in a Ultimate X match: Love how TNA starts a PPV off with the x-division. It makes you want to view the whole ppv and you hope its as good as the opener. This match was for a tag title shot. A great match, lets see if the whole ppv can be as good as this.

Fight for the Right: Take some asprin and enjoy this match. Ill give it to TNA, they can make some matches that make people go what the f%^#?

Team Pacman VS AJ Styles & Tomko: I know alot of people say TNA is almost like WCW, myself included, and why? TNA using a WCW tatic of getting football players to wrestlers. Too bad Pacman couldn't wrestle for some reason. I did like Creed though and it saved the match from going to the dump.

Black Machismo VS Christopher Daniels: Ah, the X-Division. The reason why I watch TNA. Once a rich, talent deep division. Now, its almost like the WWE cruiserweight division. A great match, even though I prefer Daniel's as Curry Man.

Steiner Brothers VS Team 3D in a Best 2/3 Falls, Table Match: You can tell Russo booked this, he loves stipulation matches. Match had a few cool spots but overall, sucked.

Knockouts Gauntlet Match: Call me sexist but I don't watch women wrestling. I rather watch lesbian porn instead.

Samoa Joe VS Christian Cage: Match of the night. I prefer watching Cage VS Joe rather then Angle VS Joe. These two men put on one hell of a match.
Better then there Destination X ppv match.

A funny moment happened at the end of this match-Styles comes down to help Cage and without looking up, West points up yells AJ Styles! A funny moment but of course, not the first time it happened. Was he reading a script?

Abyss VS Rhino VS Black Reign VS Raven in a Monster Balls match: West or maybe it was Tenay said Abyss never won a Mosters Ball match. If that didn't tell you right away who would win, then you don't know wrestling. At least Raven looks better then he did before. A decent hardcore sporfest.

Kurt Angle VS Sting: A good main event. A bit boring at the start but picked up. Would have been a excellent match but Karen Angle and Kevin Nash came to help out Angle. Why? Angle is a talented wrestler who can win a match without help. It was saved by Sting winning the title, even though it was taken away from him a few days after.

Overall, a very good TNA PPV. Highly recommed it.",1209945600,,2327,4.244343891402715

2824968,5,B000PKG6SA,"This DVD set is the best of TNA throughout 2007, based off their Year End Voting Awards through the TNA website.  Kurt Angle, AJ Styles, Samoa Joe, Booker T, Christian Cage, and others will give their comments on various subjects along with reliving various moments like Gail Kim being the first Knockouts/Womens Champion & Booker T's arrival to TNA.  Along with all of this are the top seven matches ""Match Of The Year"" candidates.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Sting - Before the match, the reception Sting got in the town that made him famous (Atlanta...home of WCW/NWA) was one of the biggest pops I've heard in recent memory. The match started off slow but went into a good match between these two with Kurt pulling off an sick looking & impressive 450 off the top rope into a kneedrop at one point. Both Karen Angle & Kevin Nash (but you knew that was coming based off the skits all night) got involved in the end but it didn't take away the match between these two as Sting won & once again walked away from Bound For Glory as a champion.
(Bound For Glory)

Ultimate X Match: LAX vs. XXX - This was an awesome opener as the Ultimate X match usually always delievers when it comes to crazy spots. Moments to look out for were Elix Skipper doing a cross bodyblock off the top of the structure onto Hernandez, Skipper getting a neckbreaker from the top of the ropes, and Senshi doing the ""Warriors Way"" double stomp onto Hernandez who was hanging from the tree of woe at that time. Great opener.
(Bound For Glory)

Elevation X: Rhino vs. AJ Styles - Usually, scaffold matches are just people punching & kicking each other back & forth on a small platform while the fans are just waiting for someone to fall off. However, this one was unique in that they pulled off some moves that you wouldn't expect like Rhino goring AJ or Styles climbing inside the steel structure under the platforms. This is one of the very few scaffold matches where the match on the scaffold itself wasn't boring & had you just waiting for someone to drop.
(Destination X)

Texas Death Match: Chris Harris vs. James Storm - Their first match at Lockdown was one of the worst matches this year...but after this one, you'll forget that match happened because this heavily made up for it & more. This was under old school Death Match rules where you had to score a pinfall & the loser has a 10 count to get to his feet or lose.  They started brawling in the crowd right from the start and went back into the ring with both men heavily bleeding throughout the match & taking some punishment like both men going through tables, being hit with their finishing moves, dueling trash can lips, and even Jackie Moore & Gail Kim getting involved.  The fans described this match perfectly...""This Is Awesome.""
(Sacrifice)

King Of The Mountain for the TNA Championship: Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe vs. Chris Harris vs. A.J. Styles vs. Christian Cage - For those new to TNA, the King Of The Mountain match is a ladder match in reverse with alot of stipulations.  To win the match, you have to use the ladder hang the belt instead of using the ladder to pull it down like a normal ladder match.  However before you can hang the belt, you have to qualify to do it by scoring a pinfall/submission over one of the other competitors...and the person who loses that fall goes into a penality box for 2 mins.  Yeah, sounds real gimmicky but when you watch it come together...it's a real easy match to follow.  Just like all of their multiman matches, this was just a wild brawl all over the place between all 5 men.  The props at ringside come into play various times like Christian getting ""crotched"" between one of the steps of the ladder, A.J. Styles being tossed over the top rope onto Christian...who was laying down on the ladder at the time, and Styles being thrown off the top of the penality box through the announcers table (Mick Foley would be proud).  In the end, Kurt Angle becomes the first TNA Champion.
(Slammiversary)

Winner Takes All: TNA & ""IWGP"" Champion Kurt Angle vs. X Division & Tag Team Champion Samoa Joe - The story thoughout the whole match was Karen Angle & her new man (who was Trademarc, John Cena's cousin & the other guy off the ""You Can't See Me"" album) being a distraction for Angle thoughout the match...even during the entrance where he dropped one of his titles & looked like a defeated man. Joe & Angle delievered the match of the match night as they must put on wrestling clinics in the ring with this time having some comedic spots like Joe pulling down Angle's trunks. Again, match of the night for this PPV (but the weakest out of their TNA matches) here with an ending that resulted in Karen Angle becoming a full time character in TNA.
(Hard Justice)

Ladder Match: Kaz vs. Christian Cage - You can quote me here...this was the best Ladder Match I've seen in TNA. We know what Christian Cage can do based on his WWE past but what Kaz was pulling off in this match as well made this the match of the night at Genesis. There were alot of moves done that were unbelievable such as Christian's frog splash onto the ladder from the top rope and the ladder doesn't give...which happened in the first five minutes. Another moment to look out for was Kaz missing a legdrop drop the top of the ladder onto another ladder. I don't want to give away everything that happened in the match but this was the match of the night & the best in Kaz's career since his return (and maybe even before as well) in TNA while Christian Cage gave a showstealing performance..no questions asked.
(Genesis)

This is set up to be one of TNA's best DVD's yet as far as match quality that I would recommend picking up.",1202342400,16,5688,4.484526112185686
2824969,5,B000PKG6SA,"TNA Wrestling Bound For Glory 2007 From The Gwinnett Center Atlanta, Ga October 14, 2007

This is the third annual Bound For Glory presented by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and only their third pay per view to take place outside of the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida.

Ultimate X Match
LAX Vs. XXX
This is a great match to start off your biggest pay per view of the year with. Just like most X-Division matches there is a good amount of high-flying action, Elix Skipper is an extraordinary athlete and also a little crazy at times which proves to be a quite entertaining combination at times. All four men pull together to put on a good match. Rating 5/5

Fight For The Right Match
In this match 16 TNA wrestlers come down to the ring and the first eight to make their way into the ring get to participate in a over the top rope battle royal until there are only 2 wrestlers left then it turns into a one fall match. Kaz pulled off some pretty nice stuff in this match and I look for him to become a star sometime in the future. Rating 5/5

TNA Tag Team Championship Match
Team Pacman (C) Vs. AJ Styles & Tomko
This match was filled with some pretty good tag team action they put on a good show and I enjoyed watching. I didn't like that whole Pacman storyline where he is a tag champion but he isn't allowed to wrestle. Rating 5/5

X Division Championship Match
""Black Machismo"" Jay Lethal (C) Vs. ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels
A great match put on by two great wrestlers, exciting until the very end especially with all those near falls. They pull off a lot of good moves but that's not too surprising if you're familiar with these guys. Rating 5/5

2 Out Of 3 Tables Match
The Steiner Brothers Vs. Team 3D
This was a pretty good table match, they put on a pretty good show it was pretty much a brawl but it was entertaining. Rating 4.5/5

Knockouts Gauntlet Battle Royal
Finally the match to crown the first ever TNA knockouts women's champion,
it starts out as a eight women battle royal until they get to the final two then it becomes a one fall match. Alot of good wrestling here, i'm glad TNA is taking this approach to their women's division. Rating 5/5

Samoa Joe Vs. Christian Cage  with special enforcer Matt Morgan
This was a pretty darn good wrestling match, both men kept it very exciting. I really wish they would push Joe for the world title he is probably the best overweight guy that I have ever seen wrestle. Rating 5/5

Monsters Ball Match
Abyss Vs. Rhino Vs. Black Reign Vs. Raven
This wasn't the best Monster's Ball match that I have seen but it was still a good hardcore match with a few nice spots. 4.5/5

TNA World Championship Match
Kurt Angle (C) Vs. Sting
This was a great main event and a strong way to end the night. A good wrestling match put on by two of the greatest of all time, it didn't disappoint one bit. Rating 5/5

This is easily the best Pay Per View that I saw from 2007 I am giving it 5 out of 5 stars, I would highly recommend any wrestling fan to buy this dvd even if you are a wwe fan and hate TNA this dvd should change your mind.",1201737600,,3089,4.288659793814433

8192191,5,B000PKG6SA,"2007 was, in my opinion, TNA's best year. This DVD highlights the best tag teams, finishers, knockouts, and wrestlers of 2007. But that is not the reason why you should buy this DVD. The matches (excluding one)are phenomenal. This review is based purely on the matches.

Rhino vs. A.J. Styles: Elevation X
This match sucks. It's boring, and it's too short. They tried to use Rhino's fear of heights for drama, but it isn't played up well enough. The ending is pretty good, but there is not a lot of action between the two. Bottom line: skip this match. You won't miss much.

Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe
While they had the best matches in 2006, this is another classic contest. The major problem with this is that they spend too much time focusing on Karen Angle. While it provides great drama, this was a tasteless story line, which took place 2 months after the Benoit murders. Anyway, great match, sweet ending. I highly recommend.

Kurt Angle vs. A.J. Styles vs. Christian Cage vs. Chris Harris vs. Samoa Joe: King Of The Mountain
This is the most confusing match on the DVD, but it doesn't take away from the match itself. Crazy high spots and Samoa Joe loosing his mind are the highlights here. Overall, the most entertaining match on the disc. The bad part is the predictable ending. Still, one of the best KOTM matches TNA has ever put on.

James Storm vs. Chris Harris: Texas Death Match
This is the best, most violent match on the DVD. The grudge match between the former members of AWM is amazing. This was at a time when these guys were in the midcard, and not really given much time. They stole this PPV and this DVD. Highly, highly recommend this!

Kaz vs. Christian Cage: Ladder Match
This is the night Kaz broke out. Cage was the experienced veteran heading into this match, and it seemed like he would walk all over Kaz. What resulted is, quite possibly, the best match of Christian's career. Even the interference of Tomko and A.J. can't bring this down. Tremendous effort by both men.

LAX vs. XXX: Ultimate X Match
Here is another example of guys who were pushed to the bottom showing why they should be taken seriously. This match opened BFG 2007, and they stole the show. Hernandez is really out of his element, but he rises to the occasion. It's a shame these guys never really broke out into their own. A great match of the best part of TNA , the X Division.

Kurt Angle vs. Sting
This was, without a doubt, the best match in TNA in 2007. It had it all, great buildup, great action, and a great finish. This was the first time Angle and Sting had locked up one on one on PPV, and boy was it magic. The best part of this match is the fan reaction. They were so into the match, it's impossible not to get sucked in. Hands down, this is the best TNA has to offer.

While the matches are great, the other stuff is really neat too. The only downside is that there are no extras, but with everything else, it's a minor complaint. If you wanna get into TNA , or just wanna relive the best days, this is the perfect way to start.",1333843200,3,3041,4.38898756660746

**THE STORY**
From their modest beginnings in 2002 and right through 2007, TNA had always been a mixed bag. A company with awesome potential and too many bad ideas, it was rare that they were able to put all their ducks in a row and produce an outstanding show from beginning to end. But thanks to some good buildup from the previous month and everyone busting their butts in the ring, that's exactly what Bound For Glory was--and it was bookended by two more excellent events in No Surrender and Genesis.

**THE SHOW**
We kick things off with a stunning Ultimate X match as the Latin American Xchange takes on a reformed Triple X (Elix Skipper & Senshi) with crazy high-flying moves, including yet another classic stunt from Skipper and a dramatic ending. The winning team gets a future Tag Team Title shot and I think the right guys won. The rest of the show just builds up from there with the bizarre but solid 'Fight for the Right' battle royal featuring most of the other wrestlers in the company, a wild Tables Match between the Steiners and Team 3D (kudos to Scott Steiner for coming back from a legit trachea injury a few months earlier that almost killed him), and the traditional Monster's Ball hardcore match with Rhino, Black Reign, Raven, and Abyss that ends with a career-defining moment for the Monster.

And those weren't even the best matches of the night. Christopher Daniels and Jay Lethal do the X-Division proud with a brilliant back-and-forth encounter for Lethal's X Championship where 'the Fallen Angel' always seems to be one step ahead, while Lethal fights back with heart and toughness. AJ Styles and Tomko, usually despised heels in Christian's Coaltion, are de facto faces in a spirited effort to dethrone Team Pacman and restore honor to the Tag Team Championship. (Pacman stays out of the ring this time, thank God, and has a substitute named Consequences Creed wrestle in his place.)

The Knockouts battle royal is a vital moment in TNA history, and the true birth of a women's division that would go on to regularly outperform WWE's ""Divas."" Entrants included Awesome Kong (debuting), Christy Hemme, Roxxi Laveaux (Nikki Roxx), Jackie Moore, and of course Gail Kim--whose mission to elevate women's wrestling in this company is finally achieved. Christian Cage and Samoa Joe steal the show in a match so good it almost hurts; Joe is larger and has the upper hand for most of it, but Cage is still portrayed as a threat. Special enforcer Matt Morgan plays his part very well, giving Joe a prime opportunity to take his revenge.

And if all that isn't sweet enough, the main event is a dream match: Sting taking on Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Title. Despite an unnecessary storyline with ""the slap (not) heard 'round the world,"" Kurt stalking Sting's son in California, and the usual distractions from Karen Angle and Kevin Nash, Kurt and Sting give us the great encounter we were hoping for. Sting looks like a god in this match. Nothing can keep him down, not even a 450 Splash from Angle or a baseball bat shot to the face that he fails to block (ouch!). A near-classic.

**THE VERDICT**
If you're a fan of TNA or wrestling in general, you have got to see this show. Everything came together in an amazing event with an atmosphere that truly felt like ""the Super Bowl of TNA."" Every match had a reason to be on the card and the crowd was amazing. In my opinion, this was TNA at its absolute best.",1238457600,4,3482,4.6721044045677
