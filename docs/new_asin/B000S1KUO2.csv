8203764,4,B000S1KUO2,"The series is in the vein of ""Lonesome Dove"" but the acting was not as good, nor the plot work.
I'd buy it again though!",1443916800,,120,3.84

8203766,5,B000S1KUO2,"There are so many dvd's it is hard to put them into numerical or chronological order. They are all sooooo good. If you like westerns, and don't mind following a series, this may be the western for you.",1358812800,2,201,4.315789473684211
8203767,5,B000S1KUO2,"I was very pleased with this purchase.  Everything was as described, clean neat and very exciting in content.  Like many, I just could not get enough of the Lonesome Dove saga.  The actors were brilliant, the scenery wonderful and the story line riveting.",1307059200,,255,4.883720930232558
8203768,4,B000S1KUO2,"For those of you who loved the entire production of Lonesome Dove, this series answers the question from the ""REturn to Lonesome Dove"", Where does Newt go? We loved the series so far and I think it's pretty good. It's money well spent. It is not the re watchable effect the  others have, but after all it is a series. It appears to be sensitive to some issues like modern mixed race couples, which is a good thing. I love the actor they got for the part and over all it is good,",1204502400,6,478,4.139784946236559
