8556173,3,B00AQ70BRE,This is a solid but a bit contrived tale of horror. The presence of master horror film legends (Cushing and Lee) help but the storyline was too confusing.,1514160000,,154,4.535714285714286

8556176,5,B00AQ70BRE,"I'm rating the DVD release of this movie, which is one of my all-time favorites from the Hammer movies. It was a great transfer, clear as a bell, no hangups or glitches.

The movie itself is, in my opinion, one of the very best Hammer made. It had a great story, some interesting twists, and lots of great actors in the roles, especially Peter Cushing as the scientist and Christopher Lee as his evil brother-in-law. I have watched this every Halloween from an old VHS tape I made from a TV release one year, and I'm thrilled to have it on DVD now!",1385164800,,548,4.320388349514563
8556177,5,B00AQ70BRE,"When I met director Freddie Francis, he had this to say about Peter Cushing:
""Peter was the best actor at making the incredible credible. I was given this film to do called ""The Creeping Flesh"". When I read the script I thought ""This is ludicrous"". Yet, when I gave it to Peter to read, it was totally believable.""",1370736000,2,314,4.431034482758621
8556178,5,B00AQ70BRE,"I really like this story. It could have used just a little fleshing out here and there but it has a great ""monster"" as well as the great Mr Cushing and Lee.

I saw it on bw tv back in the 80's, and it left an impression. Now I see why, its one of the more ambitious hammer films story wise combining several themes from other hammer films. A bit of horror express and abominable snowman in there.

And this dvd looks great, its remastered in HD.",1367971200,,445,4.103448275862069
