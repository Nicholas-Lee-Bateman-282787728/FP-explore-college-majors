8424875,5,B00000JQ5Q,"In the mass of ""drum instructional"" videos out there, there have only been very FEW that are actually instructional!  This is one of them.  All too often, you have drum videos put out by great drummers that are nothing more than a showcase...no insight...no instruction.  A lot of times, too, there are a lot of great players that are not good teachers.  They lack the ability to explain, expound, break things down to the basic concept to help a student learn or develop the thought process to start building on one's own creativity.  Don't get me wrong...I think those videos are great and are enjoyable.  But, please, publishing companies, please stop marketing them as instruction videos.  They are SHOWCASE videos.

Rick Gratton is a highly skilled drummer that breaks down some intermediate/advanced linear concepts that you can build your fill and groove vocabulary with.  He takes you step by step, note for note, sticking by sticking.  It can be tedious, but if you are really serious about your drumming, you already know that the process of developing and gaining more skill will always be tedious.  There are some things in this video that you will get right away.  You can start applying right away.  Then, there are other concepts that you might end up spending a lifetime perfecting.  The patterns he shows you only act as building blocks, how you apply them will ultimately be up to you.  That is what makes this instructional video great.

This video deserves to be re-released to DVD or maybe even an updated production.  It is too bad that this great instructional video seems to have gotten buried in the pile of showcase videos out there and almost forgotten.",1388448000,,1680,4.838596491228071
