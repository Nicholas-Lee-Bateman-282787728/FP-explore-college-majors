6932017,4,B00RNELG5E,"""A Most Violent Year"" (2014 release; 125 min.) brings the story of Abel Morales (played by Oscar Isaac). As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is ""New York City 1981"". Morales and his wife Anna (played by Jessica Chastain) are signing a contract to purchase a bay-front piece of property for their growing business, Standard Heating Oil. Meanwhile the scene cuts back and forth between that and one of the Heating Oil truck drivers being robbed, with the robbers stealing the truck. Morales is encountering more problems, facing even possible indictment by the D.A., and soon his long-standing bank is refusing to lend him the money to close on the bay-front property. Will Morales find a way to close on the property within 30 days? And who keeps targeting and robbing the Heating Oil trucks? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the new film written and directed by J.C. Chandor, who last year dazzled us with ""All Is Lost"". Here he goes a completely different direction: instead of a one-man cast, Chandor introduces us to a whole slew of characters, and the plot is as complex here as it was straight-forward in ""All Is Lost"", all to great effect I might add. There isn't much ""action"", but instead there is a lot of low-boiling tension that simmers for much of the movie. Second, as you are watching this, you can't help but think back to a number of classic movies to which ""A Most Violent Year"" seems in debt: The Godfather of course (with the heavy emphasis on family and crime), but also The French Connection (the foot chase culminating into the elevated train) and even Prince of the City. In all of them, New York plays as much as a character as any other person. Third, there are a number of remarkable acting performances, in particular Oscar Isaac (whom we saw last year excel in Inside Llewyn Davis, and Jessica Chastain, as the loyal but tough-as-nails wife (she comments at one point to Morales: ""you're not gonna like what happens when I get involved"", ha!). Last but not least there is a nice musical score, courtesy of Alex Ebert, who also scored last year's ""All Is Lost"", but this time the score is far less orchestral and much more synthesizer-oriented. And Marvin Gaye's ""Inner City Blues"" plays prominently over the movie's opening credits.

""A Most Violent Year"" finally expanded nationally this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The matinee screening where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was not attended well, and I'm being mild (a handful of people in a huge theater), and that's a shame. ""A Most Violent Year"" is a tense and gritty crime drama, the likes of which we don't get nearly enough. If you have the chance to check out ""A Most Violent Year"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly recommend you do so. ""A Most Violent Year"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1422662400,4,2968,4.673040152963671
6932018,4,B00RNELG5E,"I saw the trailer for A Most Violent Year back in October, but despite being continuously released in other cities, it didn't release in my town until just yesterday. My thoughts on A Most Violent Year.
Abel Morales(our main character), is set to make a 30 day agreement of sorts with a group of men in order to pay these men a set amount of money. Abel and his wife Anna along with their 3 kids later settle in a luxurious home all the while the suspicions of  attorney Lawrence grow, and Abel's oil company having to deal with sudden turmoils.

The character of Abel is played ever so smoothly by Oscar Isaac. He is very Al Pacino like in his suave but sharp portrayal as the character. In some of A Most Violent Year's more dramatic moments, Isaac brings a emphatic range necessary to the character; like instances when he feels betrayed or he needs to get his point across. Great job and I hope to see him in future movies. Jessica Chastain stars here as Abel's wife Anna and does a great job playing his wife as well as stepping in when she feels the need to do so. The way she is characterized is exactly how I pictured her character being portrayed-she's not weak at all-she's more of a I'm tougher/smarter than you think I am type character. David Oyelowo plays Lawrence and does a good job though I can't help wondering if his character could have been more vocal at times. Elyes Gabel stars as Julian and does Really well in the movie.

Another area, being the movie's design in terms of hair/makeup, costumes, and filming location were nicely set up which gives the movie a gritty feel.

A Most Violent Year has me admittedly divided in terms of story. For the most part, A Most Violent Year does what it needs to do in terms of story. There are the occasional action moments and a lot of the scenes are intense. Then too, A Most Violent Year succeeds at telling a story of crime, corruption, and betrayal. But with a movie titled A Most Violent Year you would think that the stakes would be higher or there would be MORE danger, but it does not always feel that way when watching the movie.  Even still, A Most Violent Year manages to capitalize with the actors involved, the dramatic undertone,and the slow buildup of the first part accompanied by the more intense drama of the 2nd and final act.

And while A Most Violent Year is not a 5 star movie it still is

A Good Experience

6932019,3,B00RNELG5E,"I saw J.C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year"" yesterday, and I am still trying to decide whether I liked it. I certainly admired the coolness with which Chandor upends virtually all our expectations for the plot. I also admired the acting, especially that of Oscar Isaac as Abel Morales, a home heating oil executive in the winter of 1981, who is suddenly beset by criminal charges and thugs hijacking his trucks; Jessica Chastain as Anna, Abel's hot-blooded, finagling wife; and Elyes Gabel as Julian, one of Abel's drivers, who finds himself victimized on all sides.

Fans of Chandor's first film, ""Margin Call,"" will not be surprised by his portrayal in ""A Most Violent Year"" of the business world as one of utter moral compromise. The cinematography of Bradford Young presents a bleak, washed-out landscape which seems to pervade the marrow of the characters' bones. In the penultimate scene, Abel makes a simple but cold-blooded gesture that demonstrates, emphatically, where his heart was all along. Unfortunately, ""A Most Violent Year"" drags in its first half, and its second half is only intermittently exciting. It presents some food for thought at the end, but although it is interesting, it is not compelling..",1422144000,4,1218,5.09
6932020,5,B00RNELG5E,"A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is riveting with its gritty style and always visually thought provoking. In this gripping story, New York City in winter of 1981, perhaps one of the most violent years in the city's history and an immigrants family trying to grow their business and profit from on opportunities, but widespread violence, moral decay, and corruption can not keep them isolated to that environment and they start to become dragged into the abyss and all they have built may be lost and destroyed forever.

Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac both give very realistic and interesting performance. Your eye never leaves them. Director J. C. Chandor style is full of energy even in those quiet and intimate moments. He finds energy in the intimacy that drives the narrative. This is a character based film and its attraction is seen in the gritty aftermath of what violence begets.",1421798400,5,876,4.918918918918919
6932021,2,B00RNELG5E,"A Most Violent Year turns on a recognizable idea long popular in cinema and literature:  the gangland as a metaphor for a capitalist society at its most competitive and voracious.  Set in the early 1980s, the film focuses on Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac, sturdy and slightly sleepy), a self-forged, urbane man with an entrepreneurial spirit and an ambitious plan for his heating-oil firm.  On the eve of a major property acquisition, he contends with numerous crises, including a series of roadside thefts from his rigs and a government investigation regarding his financial history.  He wheels and deals to the best of his ability to stay afloat while also trying to maintain a certain delusional idea of himself as a righteous American Dreamer despite the often cruel and intimidating world he inhabits.

This is an easy film to admire in the abstract or from a distance.  It has a talented cast, the most colorful member of which is Jessica Chastain as Abel's wife, a mob Lady Macbeth with hair dyed as blonde as her fingernails are long.  Her various one-liners and cold-hard-***** poses (including shooting a wounded deer while her husband hesitates and squirms) never coalesce into a profound character, but she is often a blast to observe in the moment.  The film also features a clearly obsessed-over, so-old-school-as-to-be-film-school-nerdy aesthetic indebted to, among others, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, and The Godfather.  Every frame is fastidious and just so, from the smog-iced-over color palette to the plentiful period props.  Sadly, A Most Violent Year is entombed by its style.  It is a sumptuous, more-retro-than-thou bauble with no pulse and an unsatisfying end game (one put-upon character's entire contrived, gloomy arc exists so the film can include a shot of blood mixing with oil).  It also has a pace so measured as to be frustrating and even stultifying.  A third-act car and foot chase is a welcome inclusion and a late reminder the film is not entitled A Most Dowdily Bureaucratic Year.  Overall, this is, for me, a major disappointment by writer and director J. C. Chandor, who previously made All Is Lost, one of my favorite films of the last ten years.",1421625600,13,2197,5.033149171270718
6932022,5,B00RNELG5E,"There are many different ways a person can be tested, but not all of them make for good movies. With only three movies to his credit, J.C. Chandor has taken audiences through three very different fights for survival, each more gripping than the last. Margin Call, for which he earned an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay, took us through an intense economic meltdown; All is Lost depicted a physical battle for survival against Mother Nature. Chandor's latest, the gripping crime-thriller A Most Violent Year is his most perceptive yet and looks at one man's quest to achieve the American Dream while enduring the moral pitfalls at every turn.

A Most Violent Year is something of a cross between The Godfather and Macbeth; it's about power, the corrupting influence of it and the constant need to attain more of it. But the film is also about the choices made along the way. Does having power matter if the road to getting it is littered with moral and ethical compromises? Oscar Isaac, looking more like a young Al Pacino than ever before, plays Abel Morales, a heating oil magnate in 1981 New York. It's the most violent year in the city's record and Abel is dealing with a dilemma. He's just put down a hefty deposit for a prime piece of land that will completely evolve his business, but the balance must be paid within 30 days or the deal is off and the down payment lost. However his trucks are being hijacked at an increasing clip and the drivers are looking to arm themselves, which would be illegal. Oh, and the District Attorney (David Oyelowo) is in the midst of dogged investigation into the business for possible violations.

Making for a fiery, well-dressed instigator is his wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), the daughter of a mob boss who happens to be the business' original owner. She has her husband's back through thick and thin but she's got a dangerous edge that he simply doesn't. She's her father's daughter, that's for sure, and is willing to cross boundaries that Abel won't. As his pride clashes with her ambition the sparks ignite in unexpectedly gripping ways without fully crossing over into a murderous gangster movie. While there are brief bursts of violence you keep waiting for some kind of turf war to erupt but that never happens. Chandor instead thrills us with the choices his characters make and the implications of them. When Anna breaks out a gun for the first time we know it's going to be trouble. When hijackers seem to be targeting a weak-willed driver (Elyes Gamble) it turns into a situation that could destroy everything Abel has built. And through all of this Chandor keeps the tension on a slow boil, feeding us just enough action to keep us on the edge of our seats. A close-quarters shoot-out in the city streets followed by a dangerous foot race into the bowels of the city pay off in spades. Not every subplot pays off as satisfactorily as they could as Chandor tries to juggle a bit too much for everything to wrap up neatly.

After only dealing with Robert Redford in All is Lost, Chandor has gathered a superb and very large ensemble for A Most Violent Year. Isaac can add another must-see performance to his impressive resume as the calculating, simmering Abel. Chastain gets the flashiest role and the flashiest outfits as Anna, nailing a Brooklyn accent and Brooklyn swagger like a pro. Albert Brooks, Catalina Sandino Moreno, and Oyelowo all bring their A-game to the table as Chandor proves again how good he is at pulling forth the best from his stars. Meanwhile cinematographer Bradford Young evokes the gritty street-level feel of early Martin Scorsese and Sydney Lumet, which when paired with Chandor's sharp screenplay makes A Most Violent Year one of the best crime movies in recent memory. Ultimately it's a film about doing whatever it takes to survive without losing one's sense of self in the process. They don't make movies like this much anymore when they used to be commonplace. A Most Violent Year is truly a rare breed.",1421539200,120,3997,4.764790764790765

The film also falls short on supporting its theme. The story is about morality, but after a while one can only guess what we are supposed to think of the main character and his actions. It is perhaps supposed to leave the audience to decide whether the protagonist's actions are justified or not, but even so the story needs to be engaging for us to even care.",1503878400,,502,4.5777777777777775

6932040,5,B00RNELG5E,"Fans of great drama and period crime films should delight in this interesting and thrilling tale set in eighties New York. Don't be put off by the title - this is not a film of extreme violence; the title is a statement of the era the story takes place in: New York City's crime rate back then; muggings, car jackings etc. It's an epic story that merges business and domestic worlds from the burbs to the city's grittiness. Watching Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain dramatically spa up against one another is worth the price of admission alone (as is the performance of Albert Brooks who is one of the most underrated actors - his presence in the movie Drive made the film even stronger). The cinematography is insanely good and the scene on the 59th Street Bridge is enthralling. Good director audio commentary by J.C.

6932041,1,B00RNELG5E,"How can I get the money required to expand my home-heating-oil delivery business? That actually is the holy quest or theme of this film. And the cinematic presentation of the quest is every bit as boring as the theme itself. This is a talking-heads movie that consists of people discussing how bad it all is and what might be done to make it marginally better. There are far too many words from people sitting around or standing around in environments that are anything but interesting to view, let alone compelling.

Far too much of the film is under-lit, which seems to be the vogue these days for faking suspense or interest when it doesnt really exist. If I hadnt recognized the voice of the Albert Brooks, I wouldnt have recognized him at all. Between his glasses, his heavy makeup, and the fact that he is never filmed with any light reaching his face, he bears no physical resemblance to Brooksfor no discernable purpose or reason. There is no love expressed in the film between a man and a woman, or love expressed at all. None of the elements that make a movie enjoyable are present.

His facial expressions, tone of voice etc., make me think he is essentially playing himself, or the same character all the time.

Cary Grant, essentially was always playing Cary Grant. I would gladly watch any CG film again, I must have seen North by Northwest 15+ times. With the right actor, it is most enjoyable...

Really good film, this guy Chandor is one competent guy, such an assured touch in this one, always the right pace, the right boil, which is low. Another great performance from Isaac; one of the reasons Inside Llewyn Davis worked so well for me was because I'd never seen Isaac in anything before and most actors are good only once. After that, they're ""acting."" Isaac is one of the few exceptions; like Jimmy Stewart, he simply becomes that character. Albert Brooks gives a great performance also, he's done this role before but he gives it something different here, and is really really good. (Special mention too for the hair stylist; both Brooks's and Isaac's hair add to this movie, and I can't remember ever saying that.)

Chastain is excellent, and that's Hesh, I believe, from the Sopranos, as the Hasidic Jew. Nice touch, where Chastain waits outside the van to sign the papers, unwelcome by the Jews. Another nice touch, the leaking oil at the end; that's what this has always been about -- that and the view -- so that's what Morales tends to. The blood can wait. Not your typical gangster film indeed.",1479600000,,1136,4.675

All the actors were great, but the characters sucked because the writing was awful.  They could have made Chastain's character really good.  She sort of called Abel, the main character, out on his bulls*** once, and then was a pathetic weak willed woman with no follow through for the rest of the movie.  Abel is entitled and conceited, and no one stops this weak man from getting his way no matter who he puts in jeopardy.

6932196,5,B00RNELG5E,"A solid movie about a businessman and his wife on the verge of making their dreams for their company come true when a number of bad things happen that could destroy them. In many ways it's similar to ""The Godfather"" with Oscar Isaac as Al Pacino, Albert Brooks as Robert Duvall and Jessica Chastain channeling the fury of James Caan. It's interesting to watch Isaac struggle with what he should do as his business is under attack as his wife wants him to take action that would require him to leave the moral path he has always followed. Does he give in to temptation as Michael Corleone did in the Godfather or stay true to himself?

Not one single realistic moment in the entire film- conflicts pop up as quickly and easily as they are resolved, effortlessly, by obviously crafted plot devices that are so blatantly designed to manipulate the audience's emotions and then completely kiss their ass, as to be embarrassing.

Dangers dissolve quickly, all challenges have pretty convenient solutions which amount to nothing but our hero's good luck, and every build-up is over and over again proven to be nothing worth worrying about.

Embarrassing, junior-high level writing, for a completely unrealistic plot.

Our hero glides through everything unskinned, despite his constant stress at the chance things could all fall apart.

He *barely has to compromise himself, *barely has to make any hard decisions, the criminal world he's trying to ward off never amounts to any meaningful threat whatsoever, and never takes a bite out of his soul, so his dreams *barely cost him a price.

The only weight he's left to carry on his conscience is an extremely minor one for him, almost negligible and irrelevant.

When news of the shoot out spread, the bank that was to lend the immigrant the money needed for the expansion, pulled back. He was left with no money to complete the deal and the loss of a substantial down payment. He went to his competitors begging  for loans;  which he got some, but also discovered that, though they were not behind the hijacking, they enabled it by buying the stolen oil.

There was a little bit of intrigue early in the movie, and excellent acting performances individually from Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain - which did not mesh together well, however - but the plot never elevated from there.  Overall, the movie seemed more like an anti-gun propaganda piece than a story worth delving into, with Isaac's character shunning the use of weapons to defend his family and business the whole way and little else happening.  It's not the worst movie I've seen in the past couple of months, but there isn't anything worth taking away from this movie.  The opportunity cost is better spent watching something else, or just playing with your dog.  Or deep cleaning your bathroom, it's about as exciting and at least you'll have accomplished something at the end of it.",1459123200,,909,4.915032679738562

Doing the right thing can't be compromised with the exception to losing everything. But bending your principle a little only to safe what you have worked hard for and to protect your family. Fortunately, for him he had a wife who truly loved him and their family to do what was necessary to protect the family in her own way. The wife,( supporting role) challenged her husband maybe to the extreme of risking everything, including her husband's health or getting seriously hurt by the wrong people, to see how he would handle their business crisis. Although she risked everything to challenge her husband, because she had the money to get them out their money loan predicament. In a indirect and unconscious approach, she was also being challenged by the powers that be, to do the right thing and she come through for her husband in a remarkable way at the end. This is a must see for anyone looking for a thriller that is not over the top, authentic, and a story that you can actually take from on a personal level.",1457222400,,1193,4.654028436018957

Though competently acted (can be a little wooden and rehearsed in places), there is little authenticity,  la Dog Day/Urban/Good Fellas/even Boogie, to really recommend the performances. The 'point' here is to depict a quasi-honest person in a profession that is afflicted by a criminal element. However, there is no existential tension; even the character actors seem to fall flat. This is prominent enough throughout the film (and the filming), that one wonders if the director did not intentionally aim for a sort of parallel effect.

6932470,5,B00RNELG5E,"Having watched The Most Violent Year (an exciting movie, btw) which purports to support a program called ""Cure Violence""- some observations: sent to the Direc tor of the movie and to ""Cure Violence""- which seems to be a good program. It wants to treat violence as a disease,

The movie is thoroughly engrossing- really holds yr attention- a page turner.

The features lead us to a discussion of violence- and, as a practitioner of non violence I wrote the Director and others: We have here in Baltimore at Bloomberg a similar approach (to curing violence) - the medical model- As much as I applaud it, I hope you all will not forget those on the front lines of the struggle for non-violence- Catholic Worker hero/ activists like Art Laffin and Frank Cordaro- and all that the Catholic Worker does - some getting arrested.

The Cure Violence people seemed to have no sense of the Peace Mov't that has been going on since the 60's. These folks are activists- NOT Drs or film makers. As to Chandor and the film- it has a tad re non violence- but is still a prurient, shoot-em-up godfather sctick- not that I found it boring- that adds very little to an understanding or solution to v iolence. I liked it's mention of the gun issues. ...but a clarion call for gun control? not in the slightest- it rather praises the gun.

I offer these remarks in fraternity and in the hopes movie makers could consider ways to dramatize non-violence. It's hard for me to see how- would it be a thrilling story about Dorothy Day as she founded the Catholic Worker movement? No way..

Back to the movie- to me, Chastain's beauty (as well as Oscar's) detract a tad, as do the Armani suits- in that they lessen the gritty realism of N J and NYC crime-but they are so beautiful to look at. More than most- this film keeps the suspense at a high pitch.

The character of Abel is a real surp;rise at the end- he actually turns out to be a ______________(watch the movie and get back to me)",1454544000,,1963,4.484593837535014

This could have been a fantastic exploration on the pressures felt by a man seeking to stand on ethics within a profane and corrupt world, but the story never ventures beyond base camp.

Do not get me wrong. It's a good story. But definitely not what was portrayed in the trailers. One expects this movie to be a gangster-takes-all type of movie. It is.... but it's more of a legitimate-gangster-takes-all type of movie. Not very exciting.

The movie also suffers greatly by just dropping you in the end of what was a bigger story. It was a bit confusing and would have been a far better story if there was some substance to how the protagonist got to this turnaround point of running a legit business.

6932745,5,B00RNELG5E,"New York CIty, 1981, is a blasted moral hellscape against which a very primal struggle for survival unfolds in a very tense thirty days, all for the right to supply homes with heating oil.

J. C. Chandor's ""A Most Violent Year"" is a powerfully told story, a thrilling surprise, and both Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain do remarkable work as a couple trying to close a deal that will turn their heating oil company into a much larger overall business, the deal they've been working their whole lives to prepare. This one particular month starts with them confident, convinced they're going to take things to the next level, and it unfolds with them increasingly unsure that they're going to pull it off. It is a movie about an entire city conspiring to test a marriage, and the way this one particular couple fights their way through.

This is a great screenplay first and foremost. I think it's impeccably paced, and the way the pieces drop into place, it's never too clever or too much about the plotting, but instead about watching how characters make choices. From the very first moment, Abel Morales ((Isaac) is being tested. And Anna Morales (Chastain) is right there by his side. Bit by bit, this film perfectly tests and twists and turns and tumbles them.
There's a district attorney named Lawrence (David Oyelowo) who is preparing a major case against the Morales family and their business. Anna assure Abel that there's nothing to find, that they're as clean as anyone in the industry can be. He's the one making gut check choices over the course of the film, and it's always him coming back to her, and her talking to him at the end of the day.

There's plenty to report, too. There's all of their dealings with their lawyer Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks). There's a driver who gets attacked and pulled out of his truck, his jaw broken. Julien (Elyes Gabel) wants to be like Abel. He looks at him as an example, as proof that you can make it happen if you work for it. Even after he's attacked, he wants to believe in the example.

When you think about fascinating industries to delve into on film, heating oil supply really doesn't sound like something I'd put on the top of a list. I'd be wrong, though, because Chandor's script paints this amazing, detailed portrait of the world that Abel is trying to conquer. It's not the whole world. He's not crazy. But it's his corner of things, and he wants to be able to say he did it the right way. He wants to do it with his hands clean. It's how he defines himself, and how he picks his course of action.

Alex Ebert's score is my favorite score so far, in November, and by a wide margin. It's a fantastic score, so expressive, so important to the way the film works. This is a major theatrical experience. From a perfect first shot to a perfect last shot, I think this is a carefully considered movie. Chandor's in full control over what he's doing at this point. He's been getting more aggressively stylized with each film. What he does here is not reality, and it's not meant to be. His filmmaking is very experience-oriented. We feel what Abel feels. We're with him for most of the movie. There are scenes where we follow someone else, and in each case, it's meant to put us in he shoes of these people. We're meant to feel just what it's like to try to navigate the enormous pressure they're all under, and there's a strong conversation to be had about how clean Abel's hands are at the end of the film.

Bradford Young's photography is impressive, considered, emotional. I want to watch this again in a theater, just to feel that mix, to feel that same pulse that is running through it from the start to the conclusion. Ron Patane, who cut the film, tightens the screws in just the right way, bit by bit, and I'm impressed by not only where Chandor's story ends up, but how it feels when we get there. Sometimes you just feel a different degree of control in what's happening onscreen. Sometimes you can feel that there's something special happening with the cast or in some other deepartment or, in the best case scenarios, in all of the departments at once.

I wasn't expecting whatever this film was. I am impressed by how adult it is, how confident it is, how sad it is, and yet how much it dares to say you can win after all, you can have it if you're willing to give yourself up completely. Watching how Abel salvages his deal, how he keeps his dream afloat, how he makes sure he can go home and tell Anna that everything's going to be okay it's crazy. It's dark. It's really scary on some level, because the stakes seem to be so very high.

The entire cast deserves credit, but Chastain and Isaac are amazing, so in tune, so able to read each other in a scene that there's something happening, something real, in every one of their private conversations. It's the reason I care about anything else. The mechanics of the business, the things that they do to keep it afloat, that's all only interesting because of how much it matters to these two people, and because they make it matter.

I thought ""Margin Call"" was fine. I thought ""All Is Lost"" was fine. I have liked the work of J. C. Chandor before now, but I was hardly a raving advocate. I'm onboard the Chandor train this time, though. I think this is a pretty major piece of adult emotional entertainment, something special, and I hope we get a lot more like it from him.",1447286400,5,5396,4.486761710794298

It was refreshing to see a movie where the main character was doing his best to play by the rules, and legitimately succeed. The performance makes you believe that this character could actually pull this off, as well. Note: if you are looking for ""Good Fellas"" or ""The Godfather"" in this movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. In my opinion, this movie is about doing (mostly) the right thing, in the face of overwhelming pressure to take shortcuts or give up.

6933071,1,B00RNELG5E,"An oddly awful anti-gun sermonette, extremely disappointing given the artistic firepower at the director's disposal.  Oscar Issac plays a fuel oil salesman leveraging his company to the hilt in order to purchase a distribution depot which will launch him into the big leagues, while leaking oil (pun intended)  courtesy of one or more teams of armed hijackers taking and draining his trucks, and fending off an ongoing criminal investigation.  When one of his drivers his beaten just short of paralysis and gets pacifist platitudes for his trouble, he (the driver) tools up for the inevitable next attack and hi-jinx ensue.  Throw in Jessica Chastain as Issac's mobbed-up, book-cooking gun moll wife and one wonders if the needle of Isaac's moral compass points anywhere near north.

6933133,5,B00RNELG5E,"An interesting movie. Not a crash, bang, boom - one violent, action scene after another,
but a lot of ground was covered, if you paid attention.

One reviewer said they didn't think the title was appropriate, I do.
I think this movie was a snap shot picture into their lives. the most violent year theyd
experienced except it didn't span the entire year.  It actually only gave us a look
into a little over 30 days of that year.

Some reviewers didn't like the ending.  Not every story ends with and they lived happily ever after
nor the star lying in the street in a pool of blood, or being led off in handcuffs.  Sorry folks thats not real life
for most of us.

Some said they thought the ending was missing. I didnt.  When you look at it as
a small snap shot of time, there is no ending.  Life goes on - the good, the bad and the ugly.

In real life, the legal problems, the investigations and hearings, would drag on for many yrs.
They may or may not beat the charges. After all, company money was spent / reinvested
in the company.  Maybe,  it was just bad bookkeeping. ;>)

We don't know exactly why he was being targeted by the hijackers and goons.
Were shown some possible explanations, however:

1) He was expanding his sales force into territories serviced by other companies.

2) One of his competitors also wanted to buy the same piece of property.

3) Buying the property meant gaining considerably more storage capacity, which would make
  him more powerful. Larger buys from the oil producers will cut his cost of goods sold
  and it gives him the ability to service many more customers.

4) It looks like the industry in general was dirty. Skimming, scamming, tax avoidance, apparently
  were SOP - standard operating procedures - within his industry, but he was a fish swimming
  upstreamgenuinely trying to run his business straight.

No, we don't know the reason, if there was just one. We get little glimpses as to the possible reasons -
anger, resentment, jealousy and fear. None of them will resolve themselves quickly and completely
not in real life, nor a real-life depiction.

The final conversation actually tells us a lot, if we listen.  It tells us about the past and the future.
It tells us about his moral dilemmas. The most right action, the most right choice, the most right course
to take.

A real life snap shot in time is what this movie was all about. A time that was the most violent theyd
ever encountered.",1442707200,,2444,4.543577981651376

I Recently found out Oscar's first big movie was Joseph in, ""The Nativity Story.""  I watched that movie closely since it was the first big feature my nephew did editing on.  Everything I've seen Oscar in he transforms himself into the character he's playing.  I'm no actor, however I know it takes a special gift to be able to do that and I'd imagine lots of practice of the art as well.  I can spot bad actors or maybe I should say actors who are in something they're not suited for.  ""A Most Violent Year"" is well worth your entertainment time.  Jessica also is one of the best young actors I've been enjoying lately.  The movie has a cool style and moved me emotionally.  I love movies.  So much time and dedication go into movies that are worth the viewers time.  After watching quality movies I feel like just maybe I'm a little better as a human being, but for sure I had a great time immersing myself into lives of others.

I came away from watching this film with the sense that I had just been given a brief glimpse of what the world is really like, an experience I do not get after watching Iron Man 3.

Notwithstanding the film's title, there is not an excessive or even a large amount of violence in this movie. Nor is it particularly vulgar.

It is the perfect example of how hard it is to want to do the right thing and always having bad things thrown in your pathway.

I don't think it's a justifiable use of my time to elucidate so I'll just say this: The climax hi-jack scene takes place on the onramp of a very jammed up 59th Street Bridge.  Who would hi-jack a truck going into a major traffic jam with only one point of exit -- namely, Manhattan?  I guess that might be nit-picking, but it seems to me that the movie prides itself on a certain boring, realistic nature that it doesn't even manage hold to -- and it's not even interesting when it become fantastic -- a bunch of seriously boring foot races that have no climax.

6933399,5,B00RNELG5E,"LOVED IT and proves that excess violence isn't needed to tell an incredible story. First the look: it screamed Scarface to me. These two lead actors look like Pacino & Pfieffer reincarnated. I love the fact though, that their relationship and characterizations are totally different. He attempts at all times  possible to be as honorable as possible and she is more than just a pretty face by far. They have the look of class, not trashy excess. And the eat or be eaten motto of gangster movies is not present here.
Next the drama: Because there is an undercurrent of organized crime so close to the pair (inlaws) there is always the possibility of calling in dear old dad- but not so. She may have called for a gun but used it herself, and that large sum of money came from her own schemes, not dear old gangster dad. And Abel (able) didn't even behave like a gangster when he could have been slightly justified during the incident with the truck. Who among the great movie gangsters of our time would have let that driver go basically unscathed? His idea of moving up in the family was reminiscent of godfathers, the ideals of building strength of character and tenacity, but the tasks were far from similar--learning the sales pitch instead of how to extort. His idea of being his own man was not about living off the backs or misfortunes or vices of others (aside from being better at oil supply than the competition) but the sweat and know how and satisfaction of hard honest work. He cared for those around him in a nurturing and empowering way, taking the hard stance of being brutally honest but in a helpful way, offering the opportunities for growth.
The wife:  She is not like lady Macbeth, from my estimation. She is headstrong and ambitious yes, but not to a fault. She hides away the money but its their money. She gets a gun but she only shoots a deer. Shes a good mother and supportive wife. Shes rough around the edges but is the perfect  foil to his uber straight man. Cause he is a super straight man. And also not like Macbeth because he is 100 honest in his attempts at usurping competitors, there are no murders or underhanded deals. Every time our experience tells us he will go bonkers, he reacts like a man intent on doing the ""most right thing"". His character is so impeccable that even the gangster didn't want to get involved with him. He is an old school James Stewart meets a little Grant. Super straight laced and obtusely innocent on purpose, but with enough street sense and vision of reality to come to terms with the real world. Plugging the oil leak after watching someone blow their brains out (without flinching) pretty much sums it up.
Others: I also loved the play between DA and Abel. The idea that an immigrant and Black man are making these moves and stand to gain so much in potential partnership says a lot, bump the '81 timeframe.
This is an all around AWESOME movie and id recommend it to anyone.",1440720000,,2943,4.5281954887218046

A most violent year has all the markings of a movie with substance - excellent screenplay, engaging plot, character driven script and most of all superbly filling if you know what I mean.

I'm sorry, Oscar Isaac, I didn't know who you were before this movie. As Abel Morales, the struggling patriarch, Oscar Isaac channeled some serious Al Pacino. Like, Godfather status. I look forward to seeing your next serious role (a dig at his upcoming movie XMen:Apocalypse where he plays the frowning, blue skinned villain).
Jessica Chastain as Abel's wife Anna. Likewise, very impressed with her character. The woman behind the man, as it were, but it's clear she doesn't feel that way about herself. What's Al Pacino without Michelle Pfeiffer? That's the chemistry Jessica and Oscar display.

I recommend this movie for those of you that root for the underdog, and look forward to it sinking its teeth into wolves.",1440201600,2,1154,5.193548387096774

This movie is very suspenseful and there are many connected subplots,you need to pay attention. You will be on the edge of your seat.

My favorite line is when Jessica tells Oscar that he needs to take care of the problem or she will get involved in it and He will not like that. He agrees.

Oscar Isaac: He is going to be a big star for sure. He will keep your attention.

Its pacing is like a lot of 1970s or 80s crime dramas--Serpico or the Godfather come to mind--which is quite appropriate given the film is set in 1981. The performances are stellar and the story provides an interesting glimpse into the murky realm between legitimate business and crime.

6933622,5,B00RNELG5E,"A Most Violent is the best movie that came out in early 2015 that no one knows about. As a New Yorker who was born in 1981 the themes of this film were what intrigued me to see it. I was fortunate to have found a local theater playing it and it was one of the best experiences I have had at the movies in 2015.

This film gets everything right. Many different layers of story telling, superb acting from a wisely chosen cast and an ending that will just make you uncomfortable. This movie for me reminds me of the golden age of cinema where story and characters just drive the film making the audience crave more. The characters walk a fine line exposing the proverbial grays of what is right and wrong in a time where trust was non existent. One may thing they are doing the right thing but is it the right thing when true colors are exposed. To really grind one's gears, the motives of some in this film don't even exist and impulse is in the driver's seat.

I wish that this film would have gotten the recognition that so truly deserves and I am glad to be a proud owner of this true piece of art.",1439596800,3,1100,4.15962441314554

Seriously, I kept not being able to even see Jessica Chastain there on the screen. Just Rebecca... Remarkable. Sadly, the rest of the film was not so remarkable. I never could quite figure out what the hell was going on - was the story just about the conflict of the guy channeling Al Pacino in the God Father, staying on the straight and narrow versus staying straight when forced to depart from said straight and narrow? Well, yes. That's what it was about. Not bad, but I've seen it before. Growing up in the Italian section of Trenton, NJ, I knew a lot of GodFather wannabees (pre the movie) and met an actual God Father-type once. Given direct experience, the portrayal felt like a caricature; just true enough to be instantly recognized, but distorted enough as to result in a flat two-dimensional portrayal. Not to say that the character was played without feeling. No, it was well played. But the occasional deja-vu-like experience of recognizing that you recognize the character from earlier portrayals couldn't be ignored. So, three stars. Worth watching for the tension and drama.

A young Hispanic immigrant rises to prominance in the barely legal heating oil biz in 1980's NYC. The cast of this modestly budgetted movie features some familiar faces. Most notably Albert Brooks as an oil executive. But the standout is an unfamiliar face, Oscar Isaacs as the young oil company owner.

He has his eyes on a terminal which ajoins his facility.  The offer is on the table and he has to deliver in days but doesn't have the money to drop one million plus.  Additionally, his tankers have been getting highjacked, likely by competitors.  All the while the D.A. is on his back.

Anna, his wife, daughter of a mob guy, is the business' bookkeeper.  The proverbial apple didn't fall far from tree and she's definitely her father's daughter.  In a scene where Abel and Anna hit a deer at night, Anna keeps telling Abel that they must put the deer out of its misery.  Abel goes for a tire iron.  Anna comes out with a pistol and repeatedly shoots it.

6933757,4,B00RNELG5E,"This is not the ""gangster flick"" that others have touted it to be, but rather a slow and methodical character study of Oscar Isaac's Abel Morales. This misunderstanding is at least somewhat reasonable, given that the title of the film might have one very well believe that they are about to embark on a gritty, bloody, sweaty tour through the New York City that existed at the end of the disco era. Be that as it may, what we have instead is a vignette of Morales' life over the course of a few months as he attempts to further build his modest empire against the tide of local political intrigue as well as unscrupulous competitors, at least some of who do not consider it beneath their business practices to have his fuel oil delivery trucks hijacked at gunpoint. What is most interesting about this film is watching as Abel doggedly attempts to continue operating within both the established laws as well as his own personal sense of pride and ethics.

If you are ever expecting Isaac to go full ""Tony Montana"" or even ""Michael Corleone"", then you are setting yourself up for disappointment. If, however, you want to see just how far one immigrant will go to realize his own slice of the American Dream without quite going over the line, then you're in for a very taught, well-acted, well-directed treat. As well, Jessica Chastain is superb as Abel's wife, who serves as both the angel and devil sitting on his shoulders throughout the film. One gets the feeling that at times her character is a caged tiger whom Abel must struggle to keep contained when the events of the film threaten not only their professional life, but their personal lives as well.

This extraordinary and thought-provoking movie was written and directed by J.C. Candor.

It is 1981 in New York City. Abel Morales is the business owner of Standard Heating Oil. His trucks are being hijacked. He also is entering a business transaction wherein he is going to purchase a business property that he needs to close in 30 days. He already has the loan from the bank approved but he faces tough problems when the bank canceled after he is suddenly charged with felony and misconduct from the District Attorney's office. Things also become worrisome at home when an intruder came at his new home and when his wife saw his young daughter carrying a loaded gun that was left behind.

A viewer must fully focused instead of being half-awake or better yet has only half attention to it while watching to fully appreciate the beauty of this film. Much of the events happens through the dialogues of the characters involved. Also,the people involved in the screenplay have character depth and are complex that their actions are unpredictable as the story progress. The cast involved is definitely wonderful especially the lead stars who have great chemistry and provide a great performance that would result into the viewer to be fully drawn into their characters and to discern the actions they have taken as the story progressed despite the fact that it was talky film.

6933791,5,B00RNELG5E,"From the get-go, events have conspired against the success of this film, but the first and foremost reason it tanked at the box-office is marketing. Even on the Blu-Ray cover, it is touted as a ""brilliant gangster film"". I can attest to its brilliance, but a gangster film is exactly what it is not. It has everything that a makes for a great gangster movie: a socially aware, intelligent screenplay, subtle, dynamic characters played by phenomenal actors and, most importantly, an atmosphere that oozes with menace. What it lacks is, well, violence.

Before all things, A Most Violent Year is a character study about a man trying to maintain his morality when his ambition and surroundings necessitate the opposite. Martin Scorsese once said that characters are much more important to a film than its plot. While this slow-burner of a movie is intricately plotted and paced, what drives the story home are the brilliantly complicated characters of Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastains's Abel and Anna Morales. J.C. Chandor leaves it up to the viewer whether or not their plight makes them heroic or despicable. You can't say that of many movies.

In short, buy this movie if:
-You are a fan of the 1970s films like Mean Streets, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, The Conversation (things by Scorsese, Lumet, and Coppola, etc.) This is really a throwback to that kind of movie.
-You don't mind a movie that challenges you by asking you to form your own opinions about its characters.
-You really like Jessica Chastain's face.

Don't buy this movie if:
-You are expecting a violent action movie.
-You want to watch a hammy gangster movie in the vein of Scarface
- You just want to sit down and watch a popcorn movie.",1434585600,2,1720,4.823728813559322

A couple guns here and there but not by any means the focal point of this film. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is trying to start an oil transport business in the 60's (I think) and his trucks keep getting hi-jacked by persons unknown and he gets no help from the cops or the feds. He is trying to be that honest man but keeps running into situations that aren't his to control (his greedy mobster's daughter of a wife, pure nightmare) he should have bumped her off, ah well, terrific tale and that is what it is. I was never bored or uninterested at all. Bravo to the performers, Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain (the shrew of a wife), David Oyelowo (prosecutor) Albert Brooks (again magnificent).

6933821,4,B00RNELG5E,"I very much liked J. C. Chandor's ""Margin Call,"" his story about the financial crash as it affected an investment bank.  It managed to be dramatic, while doing justice to complicated financial dealings, and there was plenty of tension, even if there wasn't much sex and violence.  Here again, Chandor shows his ability to make clear complicated business arrangements , this time those necessary for success in the competitive fuel-oil markets in the outlying boroughs of New York City c. 1981, where one's rivals are as likely as not connected to shady and even criminal operators, and where ambitious district attorneys, looking to make a political impact, can make life difficult for even relatively honest dealers.  Here Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the ambitious head of a heating-oil company, Standard Oil, and his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) is the daughter of a gangster.  The fact that Abel wants to operate his business honestly -- and still put his rivals out of business -- is the source of the unusual dynamic in the Morales marriage, which is as interesting as anything in the movie.  Not all of Abel's competitors are scrupulous, and some are willing to resort to theft, beatings, and even murder -- so there comes a point where Anna's view that Abel needs to be as ruthless her father used to be is something that the audience is willing to entertain.

When Abel's rivals find out that Abel is seeking to buy a piece of property on the East River that will give him a clear competitive advantage, they take steps to make it difficult for him to come up with the money he needs within the time-frame that the sellers of the property have specified.  When a DA (David Oyeowo) lets Abel know that he's considering a multi-count indictment against him, then even the sympathetic bankers who might have been good for the money that Abel needs bail out on him.  Gallingly, it's clear that the DA has no clear case so far, but the very idea of (and publicity about) a likely indictment is figured to be good for the DA's reputation.  It is, of course, a threat to Abel's.  Anna spends a lot of time looking at the company's records for years back in an effort to determine that there is really no case against them, and it is she -- and I'm avoiding spoilers here -- who finds a way around the problems of coming up with the money.

The tension comes from the representation of the marriage and from Abel's efforts to work constructively with both his rivals and the DA, even when the good faith of these other parties is questionable.  There are problems too with unions -- the union boss (Peter Gerety) wants Abel to arm his drivers -- and with drivers and their families.  The question is -- can Abel survive as a reasonably honest and humane man?  What compromises might have to be made?  Will he become a Michael Corleone? The answer is surprising, and the final meeting between Abel and the DA, wonderfully conceived and written, is admirably executed by the actors.  In fact, the acting is splendid throughout, with Chastain perhaps the most compelling performer in what is, I think, the most interestingly conceived role.  The movie looks great too, and Chandor allows one chase sequence, and very good it is.  So this is a thriller that doesn't insult our intelligence.",1433721600,,3288,4.708551483420593

There's several scenes with his wife that nails these points home. This movie is essentially the antithesis of a ""mobster"" movie.

6933884,4,B00RNELG5E,"Most of the complaints I've seen being leveled against this film from some of the recent reviews here say something about it being too slow, or boring, not enough action, etc. Objectively speaking, they might be partially right, but that doesn't make this film objectively bad. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR will probably not be to everyone's taste, particularly those who want something with higher stakes or a more high-octane feel to it, but for people who appreciate a moody, character-driven drama this should do just fine. The film is set in 1981 New York, apparently one of the most violent years on record. Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales, the owner of a heating oil delivery company who quite ambitious but also cautious in the way he does business. His wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain), is a variation on the gangster's moll who lets her husband run things the way he wants to, but not without letting him hear her opinions. The two make quite a nice pairing and contrast with each other in very interesting ways, most importantly in how to best secure themselves against the rash of violence coming over their city. Thematically, the director J.C. Chandor is very interested in the morality of doing business and the fine line between ""accepted practice"" and gangsterism. It's also a story about an immigrant navigating his way among sharks as he attempts to build his version of the American dream. While this territory has been covered before, J.C. Chandor takes a step back and looks at it with a colder, more steely gaze. Everything from the shot choices to the hazy color correction suggests a calculation that is necessary in a murky, uncertain situation, and the tension that builds up in certain scenes, as well as over the course of the film, is palpable. And everything from the performances and overall put-togetherness of the film conveys the calculated intentions of the director, much like Abel is in his business dealings. Ultimately, given the slow and cerebral nature of the film, this is something easier to admire than actively enjoy. Still, it was a very interesting character study that was able to maintain an excellent level of tension throughout its 2-hour running time.",1430956800,2,2191,4.924324324324324

6933905,4,B00RNELG5E,"A Most Violent Year drips with the sophisticated confidence (and gritty 1970s style cinematic veneer, though the story takes place in 1981) of a classic mob picture from the early stages master director Martin Scorsese career. It is acted to perfection by an extraordinarily capable cast (the leads, Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain, along with Selma star, David Oyelowo, bring their roles to incredibly vivid life) which captures the danger and elegance of the characters that populate the screen masterfully well, the pace effortlessly moves the story forward and never hits a dull note. Such, along with a narrative which is always engaging and a gorgeously written script by director J.C. Chandor, makes the proceedings in the overall immense quality of the film all the more evident and the work overall the more admirable.

Given the heft with which entries in the crime genre hit theater screens it is fair to say that we have seen the motions the story takes many times over. Regardless of this it is only in retrospect we notice these things and the motions of the chronicle never feel tired because of most finally here is so mercilessly engrossing we never noticed such petty squabbles while the one hundred twenty four minutes of this film is rolling. It is only after the end credits have finished and the film lets up its grip on our psyches are we able to see the aforementioned routine cracks in the storytelling pavement.

As mentioned beforehand, the year the title refers to is 1981. The narrative focuses on Abel Morales (Chris Isaac) who has come to America with the hopes of increasing business. With the false hope of the American dream, that being we can be who we want to be if we just work hard enough at it, driving him he soon finds himself thrust into the crime life and fears suffering the repercussions as he becomes part of a Mob war that threatens his livelihood, his family and all hes worked so hard to obtain.

 Much of this has to do with how well done all of the aforementioned assets of this motion picture are but, it is also because and never loses focus of the intimate family element, the personal drama of its well- honed in orchestrated characters. A Most Violent Year cares for every last one of the individuals populating the screen and, refreshingly (or maybe because of the nature of everyone in this feature), there is no distinct antagonist or protagonist. All of the individuals herein contain traits of both and it adds a layer of authenticity, admittedly apparent in many other movies in the gangster genre, that makes the violence promised in the title (which explodes at about the hour mark and takes up most of the second half) more than just people shooting at each other like any garden-variety modern day action offering but actually adds drama and intensity to the proceedings.

 This is director J.C. Chandor' third feature (the last two being the wonderful HBO Original Film: Margin Call in 2011 and the critically adored, but not by me, Robert Redford vehicle All is Lost in 2013) and it beautifully mirrors the attitude, demeanor and overall am here have a crime films from the 1970s in the best way possible. It has the unique personality, the visual appeal, the equal focus on both story and character that marks the best films from this decade. A Most Violent Year also has the sensibilities to wisely interject some social commentary and subtle bits of topics that seems ripped from modern news lines (namely the criminology behind the behind doors workings of the oil business which, as we all know, has been an unavoidable subject for well over the last decade), as was the case and even the most mainstream of films from the seventies. There is also an undeniable air of The Godfather, again another of the previously mentioned parallels to one of the best cinematic eras of our time, which helps the enjoyment factor, especially for fellow cinephiles, of this feature spectacularly. Such traits make A Most Violent Year occasionally familiar motions have a decidedly classy timeless and nostalgic feel.

This film is an absolute must for those of us who like a little contemplation, genuine heart and character development in between bouts of random barbarity. This focus elevates the material. It keeps Chandor' latest feature, especially in the finale when most of these types of big screen affairs simply go ballistic with the gunfire and explosions, from becoming just another action vehicle, another celebration of the tried and true which leads to an equally exhausted operatic display of cruelty between two unified sides who find themselves at war with one another. That is, of course, even if the content isn't exactly groundbreaking.",1430438400,,4716,4.880149812734082

6933929,5,B00RNELG5E,"The worst thing that I can say about this terrific thriller is that it has the worst possible title. Judging by the kind numerous negative comments on this page, it is obvious that it has been attracting the wrong audience. If you're looking for a mindless orgy of gratuitous violence, this is not the movie for you. This is a serious film about a man who is trying to conduct his business (the transportation of heating oil) without falling prey to bad practices, but, as in Greek tragedy, the circumstances are all against him, and that includes his wife, a tough cookie whose father and brother are both gangsters and who constantly threatens to bring them into the equation. This film could also be seen as a tale about the dak side of Capitalism.

The pace builds slowly to a riveting climax. Some may not care for the dim and greenish photography, but then this is not a musical. The acting is terrific and the director knows what hes doing, but you're warned: this is a thinking mans thriller, and not a video game for Multiplex consumption.",1430006400,,1048,4.60427807486631

Violence is not just about blood, guts and gore. That kind of violence ends with a beaten body or a fatal gunshot, and then onto the next frame where a family burns alive in an arson fire. But nothing is worse than silent fear. It crawls inside your soul and eats at the marrow of your bones every minute of every day. This movie solidifies that silent fear never stops. It builds and seethes, waiting for an explosion; its all consuming, and real to life. A Most Violent Year has been compared to other movies, but I say it stands on its own merits.

6933932,1,B00RNELG5E,"This has got to be one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time, if not ever.

The one positive I can really say about this movie is the performances by Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain. I've become a big fan of both of these actors in the last few years, and their performances in this movie were truly electrifying. Oscar Isaac is totally a young Al Pacino in this movie. If they ever do a return to the Godfather franchise, then Oscar Isaac needs to play a Corleone.

Other than that, this movie has so little to offer. I didn't understand the character's motivations at all. This hardly qualifies as a crime drama, as there is no criminal activity seen at all. Just a couple of guys shooting each other on the highway, but even these guys don't know how to handle a gun or what to do when someone shoots back or anything. It's just ridiculous.

For being titled ""A Most VIOLENT Year"" there hardly any violence in the whole movie. Oscar Isaac's character isn't a mob boss, and has no interactions with the mob whatsoever. How can a movie be classified as a ""crime drama"" when there is no hint of criminal activity going on. Ok, there's one thing - **SPOILER WARNING** they lied in their books about how much money they were making, skimmed some money off the top. THAT'S IT!! Otherwise, Isaac's character is trying to run his business with complete legitimacy and transparency.

Skip this one, I wish I could get my $5 back so I could spend it on another movie. I love crime dramas and am always looking for the next GODFATHER, UNTOUCHABLES, LA CONFIDENTIAL, and so on. This movie doesn't even come close.",1429920000,,1618,4.47457627118644

6933935,4,B00RNELG5E,"You're obviously not going to enjoy this movie if you are not into movies designed around the acting, it's that simple. And this movie accomplishes what so many newer movies fail to, it convinces me that this is actually happening that, this corruption is taking place and that the protagonist is trying to hold to a solid set of moral boundaries even if that means treading very close to the border of danger.

The aspect of the movie that is most convincing is the acting of course, and I have skimmed a few negative reviews both before and after viewing the film and must point out that they are only justified if you do not enjoy drama and acting. This film epitomizes these attributes, and if you are able to tolerate people talking about important issues and dramatic exchange for two hours then there is no way this movie will bore you or put you to sleep. Only if you have the attention span of a 12 year old (which I actually do some times, which is why I don't watch movies like this on those days).

The way NYC is presented is just as a back drop, but convincingly and dramatically so. They managed to sneak the twin towers into a shot, which I thought was very charming and adds to the historical vibe of the film. The film does not get you to focus on NYC it merely uses it as a stage from which to launch its primary moral tenets. A good character study of a painfully moral business man who is surrounded by corruption. Must watch for anybody who has a decent attention span.",1429747200,2,1491,4.359712230215828

What I would say is the fact it wasn't is probably spot on. People are so in love with any period film, apparently even if it's set in the 80's, about NEW YORK. A film about New York simply doesn't make it a good film. A Most Violent Year ended up being a predictable film that was written in such a way as to leave me waiting for the punch line on a bad joke. You'll say, ""Really...thats it."" Its set up to present itself as having a twist, but the twist never comes. Hard working guy comes up in the company, marries the owners daughter-----buys the company, struggles to grow it all while dealing with the police (who goes from super cop to in the end willing to trade the investigation for political favors), petty crime (which looks intricate as if its his competitors behind it, yet its just petty crooks stealing), and a strong personality in Jessica Chastain (who gives you the impression shes the Godfather's daughter, yet shes just a simple chick stealing from her own company by shaving the books?) who plays his wife. She was actually was the star of the film and the script robbed her. Oh and I almost forgot--the intricate deals he's making with his competitors to close the deal of a lifetime, only to be given a bank account number by his wife to an account where she's keeping money she stole from herself??? Writers, if you want a most violent year in the 80's, um that would be Miami? Every movie in Miami tries to be ""HaHa South Beach."" But I was there, 17, and it was really scary. I know the John Gotti thing, but the FBI and NYPD was all over that. The cops in Miami were still carrying 6 shot revolvers, and drug money was king . I could maybe go 3 stars for the cinematography----that snow falling in the beginning when the armored truck brought him what he thought was his life saving to do a deal.......awesome.

6933960,3,B00RNELG5E,"It's a decent movie that fails to meet expectations...If that makes any sense. What I mean is that the trailer and title of this film creates in the prospective viewer the notion that this film will be a raw, gritty, gangster/mafia type of flick when it is hardly that. Yes, the sanitation industry in NY used to be heavily influenced by the different Italian mafia families and yes, they battled over routes and territories, at times very violently.

A Most Violent Year clearly indicates that the sanitation industry is corrupt but it does not explicitly introduce any mafia element or gang affiliations. It just hints at the corrupt nature of the business. With that being said, there is hardly any violence in the film (at least by today's standards), rather there is much more dialogue and character dynamics. The film is decent but because of the title, I had a whole 'nother idea of what I was about to watch. It was a gripping film to watch partly because I was waiting for the violence and bloodshed to occur...It turns out there really was none.

Bottom line: It's okay but It's not worth paying for the rental or DVD purchase. I'm glad I did not see this in theaters.",1429401600,,1178,4.631578947368421

6933962,5,B00RNELG5E,"A Hidden Gem with Superb Performances + Outstanding Plots!

Abel Morales (Oscar Issac) - is married to Anna Robbins Morales (Jessica Chastain) and have two daughters.
in New York City, in 1981. Abel bought his father-in-law's heating oil distribution business operating successfully in the New York market.
Abel is the front runner among those competing to purchase a $2.5 million prime riverside property that would allow him to expand the business and become the largest New York heating oil distributor.
Its a crime drama set in NYC during the winter of 1981, which was statistically, one of the most violent years in the city's history, and centered on the lives of an immigrant and his family trying to expand their business and capitalize on opportunities as the rampant violence, decay, and corruption of the day drag them in and threaten to destroy all they have built.

Both Oscar Issacs and Jessica Chastian roles are dynamic, riveting, and true to their characters.

Superb performances - While Abels character is the definition of a cool, calm, patient, honorable & deadly immigrant Sicilian; Annas role (as the WASP) is aggressive, cutthroat, in a family protective display; against the tide of scare tactics, violence, DA investigations, and corruptive environment ... this combo simply works beautifully.

In the films background and plot, there are hints of The Godfather and American Hustle movies in this gripping crime drama, by Martin Scorcese.

In one of the scenes, Abel starts speaking flawless Spanish, and I thought WTF ... Who Is This Guy??

abel morales quote - You should know that I have always taken the path that is most right. The result is never in question for me. Just what path do you take to get there, and there is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.

Last word - this film does not match it's ""Title"" in terms of ""violence"", as you would expect from a Gangster-type of movie characterization, it's much more than that, and perhaps the afterthought would have been for an alternate title.
I normally just don't review movies oir films for that matter, but, felt compelled to do so in this one, as I feel that Martin Scorcese's body of film work has been really Outstanding overall; so i fundamentally disagree with some of the ""reviewers"", who have made a Mockery of writing incoherent slabs of copy, with artificial sweetner, for the less-informed.
First of all, this has a awesome cast, was well-written and excellent plotted crime drama, for those that can appreciate a first look and SUBTLE-NESS into the world of NYC's 1981 world of increasing Corruption and Politics.

The saffron colored still shots and up your nose close-ups of meet-ups are so redundant that the whole thing begins to feel like being force-fed overcooked fish stew. The best lines and only real action come from Anna, the daughter of a mob leader, married to a guy she would like to smack around just to get any expression at all on his immobile, humorless face. In one homecoming of her husband's, she says basically, something like ""How was your day, honey?"", when what she really means to say is, ""Maybe EST will help?"" (Electro Shock Therapy) In another scene, she has to take charge, because Mr. Morales doesn't have the courage he needs to do what is actually and honestly ""morally right"".The only living being that elicits ""I care about this character,"" is the deer dying on screen after being hit by their car.

6933984,5,B00RNELG5E,"""The Godfather"" imagined a world where organized crime was run like a legitimate business.  ""A Most Violent Year"" reverses the logic and supposes that in order for the private entrepreneur to thrive they must adopt the ways of the Mafia.  The setting is New York, 1981.  Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a fledgling home heating oil magnate who's looking to expand.  He puts a large deposit down on a piece of property with the contingency that if he doesn't come up with the remainder in a week's time he forfeits the down payment.  Timing couldn't be worse for Abel.  His competitors are employing mobster tactics hijacking his delivery trucks and assaulting his employees.  On top of that the district attorney (David Oyelowo) is making an example of Abel by investigating his business practices on the most specious grounds.  Abel prides himself about being above reproach but his present situation causes him to reconsider his approach.  J.C. Chandor's film is a fascinating account of doing business in an ethical cesspool.  It has a lot to say about how we conduct our affairs in America and the fine line that has to be nudged just to survive.  Isaac is nothing short of brilliant as Abel demonstrating his turmoil with few histrionics.  Jessica Chastain as Abel's wife Anna nearly steals the show in a performance that suggests Lady Macbeth.  The daughter of mobsters Anna subtly manipulates Abel to act in the ways of the world as opposed to his idealized vision of it.  A telling scene shows Abel hitting a deer in the road.  Abel hesitates in putting the wounded animal out of its misery before Anna pumps two slugs into it.  A fascinating film that may be misconstrued as a traditional gangster film in the Scorsese tradition instead of the work of a visionary up-and-coming auteur.",1429228800,3,1792,4.845394736842105

I don't know if I would compare him to Al Pacino. Pacino is more energetic or dynamic. I'm not saying that Isaac lacks these qualities. He doesn't really need them. He is quite magnetic. I saw ""Two Faces of January"" and he was again that sort of ever present masculine force that seems sort of detached. I liked him in ""Sucker Punch"" and in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" even though I did not like that movie. Anyway, the movie draws you along. Chandor directed notably well with some very nice imaginative touches. However, just as a side note, European or South American movies, even when not as smooth and as well crafted (Violent Year is well crafted), have more warmth. The characters are more real and sympathetic. It would be interesting to see Isaac in a movie by Inarritu, Almodovar or Juan Jose Campanella just to name a few.

6934040,4,B00RNELG5E,"A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is a drama that takes place in New York City in 1981. Latino immigrant Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is in the oil business, transporting large quantities of heating oil. After placing a large deposit on a storage site by the river, Morales finds himself hampered by politics, a police investigation, money lenders, and underworld types. Being honest seems to count for little in a highly competitive business in which profits trump ethics.

Isaac (INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS) is a fine actor and portrays Morales inner struggle as hes caught between a rock and a hard place. The violent of the title refers not to graphic violence, but to a system rife with corruption. Morales wants to do the right thing and has always run his business honestly, yet is confronted with odds that might destroy his business and pursuit of the American Dream.

This is a deliberately paced film that shows how Morales deals with the forces working against him as the clock ticks down to a crucial deadline. A prime flaw is the films lack of adequate tension. The viewer never quite feels Morales hourly struggle to stay afloat because director J.C. Chandor presents the story in a sustained, unemotional manner. There are places in which performances could have been more intense.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include audio commentary with writer/director J.C. Chandor, Behind the Violence feature, a conversation with Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, deleted scenes, and a look at the origins of A MOST VIOLENT YEAR.",1428537600,3,1527,4.980392156862745
6934041,4,B00RNELG5E,"If you're not a fan of violent films don't let the title of this one scare you away. There is actually very little violence in A MOST VIOLENT YEAR, even though it concerns the potential rising of a gangster boss. What the title refers to is the year 1981, considered statistically to be the most violent year in the recent history of New York City.

What the movie actually involves is the story of Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac), an immigrant who has worked his way to the top of a heating oil business. While he did work his way up he later bought the business from his boss as well as wed his daughter Anna (Jessica Chastain). Successful in his area, he now wants to expand and to help do that hes attempting to purchase land next door to his operation. With this riverfront location, he can import cheaper oil and take on his competitors. Having placed a down payment using everything he owns as collateral, he now has to make good on the balance within a few days.

But someone doesnt want to see that happen. Someone has set in motion several problems that will keep Abel from achieving his dreams. As Abel tries to do things on the straight and narrow, he finds it more difficult to work that way in this city than he thought. It begins with the hijacking of his trucks, the first one we see driven by Julian (Elyes Gabel of SCORPION fame). Beaten and hospitalized, the theft takes its toll on Julian. On top of this, a local DA (David Oyelowo) is investigating the company books. While Abel is certain there are no problems, Anna isn't quite to optimistic and wants to hang on to them as long as possible to go over them.

While his father-in-law once delved into the world of organized crime, Abel wants to steer clear of them at all costs. But with each new roadblock placed in front of him the temptation to do so lingers. Harassed at home by the DA, more trucks stolen and with no one to turn to when the bank who pledged to loan him the money to purchase the land next door backs out, Abel must find a way to fight off those who stand in his way of success without digging a hole from which he can never escape.

The movie plays out like many of the gangster films from the seventies and eighties and has been compared to the movies made by Sidney Lumet. This is actually a great description of the style and feel of the movie. Lumet was known to capture the feel, the heart and soul of what the seedier sides of NYC were like while at the same time showing a love for the city as well. This film does that in spades. Put side by side you might notice the difference, but you would also recognize the similarities as well.

More so than the look of the film is the combination of screenwriting and acting that make this film pop. Isaac turns in a fantastic performance here often reminding at least this viewer of the young Al Pacino in THE GODFATHER, perhaps one of the best performances in screen history. Here he exudes the successful appearance of a business owner in high priced suits and camel hair coat. His attitude is one of slowly simmering anger that almost never boils over. This subdued faade that his character puts on makes him feel all the more dangerous.

Chastain also turns in a great performance. Her character moves from one emotion to the other, at first being the supportive wife and then flipping over to a more manipulative player in the events that take place. She wants what is best for her family, her husband, and is willing to do almost anything to insure that this happens. As with Isaac, her performance is subtle and suggestive, with an underlying sense of danger at her core. Combine these two performances and you have a married couple that will do whatever it takes to become successful.

The movie received plenty of praise when released but seems to have fallen under the radar of most movie theaters. I don't think it even played in any of the local main theaters here where I live. Thats sad because far too often I find the newest blockbuster playing on 5 of the 20 theaters in the local megaplex. And with 3 movies like that it limits the number of different films playing so we miss out on many great movies that way. Thank goodness we can make up for it via DVD.

The movie meanders along at a steady pace and features less action than one would expect with a title like this. But don't let that fool you. What you get is a complete story that holds your interest from start to finish. It is definitely worth watching.",1428537600,7,4471,4.39782345828295

I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I thought it was going to have a mafia feel to it and I sat down excited about it. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The movie itself wasn't bad, it was very well made and the acting was great. The problem was that it was very slow moving and a little tough to get into. Isaac was a great choice for this role, but Chastain really steals the movie. She is ruthless and very scary but very under used. I really think the movie would have been helped had she been in it more. Again though, this is really not a bad movie, I think my expectations were just a little too high and it didn't live up to them. Overall, very well done and great acting but I was still disappointed.

Oscar Isaac does an outstanding job as Billy. He is a man seeking a loan to further his business and he will not stop at any intervals. He is a strangely good man, he is a very good salesman, he is a good husband, an undedicated father and a man of his word. There are so many virtues of his character, I feel that is a bit of a lost art. I mean, there aren't several films that bother to build on the virtue of its characters and eventually you know them like family members.

Well,
A Most Violent Year is a regressively good film. It has many layers and a very well mapped script. All potential characters come into play. The film is very inspiring because the central character is so immune to negativity and stopping. Another thing I noted about the film was that it shows the twin towers in NYC skyline. Being that this film is based in 1981, I thought that was most excellent.

There were two scenes that held my breath and attention very long. I had forgotten what's going with the rest of the world for the last one hour. Oscar Isaac is easily one my newer favourite actors. His role is polar opposite to the one he played in Llewyn Davis.

His oil company trucks are being stolen regularly, his people beaten up, nobody knows who is doing it, the Feds are investigating him and a mutli million dollar 30 day deal is falling apart that will bring ruin to his life.

6934091,4,B00RNELG5E,"As much as I love a good gangster movie, A Most Violent Year (AMVY) was refreshing in its lack of what we've come to expect from the genre. Yes, the businesses in the film are crooked, but the organized crime aspect is relatively mild (you don't have people getting whacked). The father of the protagonist's wife is/was in the Brooklyn mob, but we never meet him. While there is little in the way of violence that will make you cringe, AMVY does manage to make you jump out of your seat a couple times with surprising interruptions during some quiet scenes.

AMVY is a 1980s New York crime period piece done right, in stark contrast to the also recent but fairly awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Green-Dragons/dp/B00OUNQ4BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Green Dragons</a>. The dialogue is sharp, and the film boasts attention to detail in getting NYC right (e.g., subway cars with graffiti on them, in the era before NYC's extensive car-washing program of the late 1980s). Not only does AMVY successfully take you back in time, it also presents a protagonist with whom [if you are a decent human being] you can empathize more than was possible with Tony Soprano.

This was my first time around the block with Jessica Chastain, and I found her to have done an exceptional job here; AMVY would not have been the same movie without her. The only actor I recognized was Peter Gerety from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B00UCOXZLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>, which I consider among the finest of television shows ever produced.

Don't get me wrong with a 3 star rating, there is a lot in this movie that is really solid: Alessandro Nivola, the production design (they did a great job at nailing the 1981 ""look""), and probably most of all, the music. The music was excellent, and conveyed a great, grave seriousness in the background, although I think the music mustered more seriousness than the acting and screenplay. Props to this movie for incorporating all aspects of a business, from the sales to the executive maneuvering to the crime etc. There is not much else to say about this movie, other than the fact that I would actually recommend it.

6934097,5,B00RNELG5E,"The word that keeps coming to mind in relation to my thoughts on A Most Violent Year is exquisite. Im primarily speaking to the elegant, yet fierce, feel of the film and the complex duo of characters within. Its a movie that effortlessly manages to pull off something that most never can, a perfect balance of delicacy and intensity in almost every scene. That fusion is really what makes the movie great, along with the commanding performances at the center from both Oscar Isaac and Jessica Chastain.

Taking place in the early 80s, it focuses on a young, power-hungry businessman (Isaac) struggling to protect his livelihood in any way he sees fit. We witness his many attempts to keep his oil company afloat amidst one of the most crime-ridden winters in history. But, unlike his extremely determined wife (Chastain), he doesnt feel the need to act in a violent or aggressive way to do so. He approaches things in a calm, reserved fashion - for the most part - and tries to keep everything in his life together.

It struck me as one of those pictures that will slowly garner a huge audience and appreciation over the years, particularly because it speaks to a time and place that isn't typically being shown in this day and age. We may have films that deal with overbearing crime in big cities, but not ones that compare in style and resonance. Thats the beauty of this film, it doesnt hit you right off the bat as deeply as it does the weeks after youve seen it. It allows its audience to infer, and the more you mull it over the more you see the brilliance. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly was for me. It doesnt miss a beat, and neither do the actors involved.",1423958400,4,1679,4.501639344262295
6934098,4,B00RNELG5E,"Written and directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All is Lost), A Most Violent Year could easily - and appropriately - have been titled Fifty Shades of Gray if that name had not already been taken by the best-selling book and subsequent film. The reason I say this is because no one in this movie is black or white, not in their behavior or in their motivations. While nominally a crime drama, A Most Violent Year is actually more of a character study of people in a particular place and time - New York City in 1981 - in a situation where the lines between ""business"" and criminal behavior are very gray indeed.

Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the hard-working and ambitious owner of a successful and growing company that supplies heating oil in New York City where the competition is high and highly ruthless. How ruthless is shown at the beginning of the film where we see one of his delivery trucks, driven by one of Abel's drivers named Julian (Elyes Gabel), being hijacked in broad daylight by armed thugs, who beat Julian severely before driving off in the stolen truck.  These hijackings have become a growing problem for Abel, each theft costing him thousands of dollars in lost heating oil. But no one seems to know who is behind it.  Moreover, these hijackings are coming at a very bad time for Abel as he is on the verge of sealing a deal for the purchase of a fuel oil terminal on the East River that, if it goes through, will give him a major advantage over his competitors, while at the same time he's under investigation by an assistant district attorney named Lawrence (David Oyelowo) who's intent on going after he feels is price-fixing, tax evasion and other illegal activity in the heating oil business. Adding to Abel's stress is the pressure he's getting from the drivers' union to arm his drivers so that they can defend themselves, a move that Abel feels will only make things worse both by escalating the violence and getting him into legal hot water. But even worse is the pressure he's getting from his tough-minded wife Anna (Jessica Chastain) who not only thinks he should arm the drivers but that he should get help from her family's mob connections, which Abel adamantly refuses to do. Abel's long-time lawyer Andrew (Albert Brooks) is trying to help Abel navigate all of these tricky waters, even as the rising violence increasingly limits Abel's options.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes crime dramas where the characters and the situations are realistic and complex",1423526400,5,2507,4.729977116704806
6934099,5,B00RNELG5E,"A Great but for Some Misunderstood Film

Perhaps it is the way the film has been marketed, suggesting it is more violent and clearly within the gangster film genre.  Perhaps it is the title, which really is not misleading.  But this excellent film seems to draw an unusual amount of negative posts that are not based on a real understanding of it.

The film is primarily best understood as a parable, examining the connection between a kind of moral relativism and how one makes one's way in modern American capitalism.  The specific focus is where and how the protagonist, under pressure from a number of directions, decides where to draw the line, and then redraw it as circumstances seem to require, all while trying to maintain not only control but some degree of coherence in one's moral principles.  Oscar Isaac is very persuasive here in his attempt to balance his preferred persona of the cool customer under control, with an evident buildup of tension as events challenge him.  Jessica Chastain, one of today's greatest actresses, is exceptional as his wife and business partner, having a rather different moral calculus, but not wholly different.  The ensemble cast and the sets, the atmosphere, are all excellent.

But this is not a film filled with loud noises, wall to wall explosions and numerous events of graphic violence.  If those elements are required in your film viewing, don't watch this rather more mature film.

As of this writing this is my favorite film released in 2014.  Other than the foregoing caveat, I highly recommend it, and don't be dissuaded by those who expected some other film for some reason.",1423526400,7,1632,4.8945454545454545
6934100,4,B00RNELG5E,"Set in 1981 - one of the most violent years in New York City's history - A Most Violent Year is about a poor, hardworking immigrant named Abel (the brilliant Oscar Isaac) who has worked for years to build up his heating oil distribution business, determined not to take the easy way in an industry rampant with organized crime members.  Determined to keep things as honest as possible (tax evasion and juggling the books, maybe - but violence or ANY kind of felonies, no way) for his family - even with his wife, Anna (Jessica Chastain, also amazing here) being the daughter of a low-level crime boss in Brooklyn - when Abel overextends himself to buy a piece of land that would considerably expand his business, he also finds his drivers falling victim to a pair of thugs who beat them, then steal their trucks - and the precious oil that's the lifeblood of Abel's business.  A serious, not exactly uplifting drama, the film is a terrific, realistic chronicle of the life of one man, struggling to find the American dream for his family on the rightest path possible.",1423267200,2,1068,4.645502645502646
6934101,5,B00RNELG5E,"This was arguably one of the best films of 2014. The performances are top-notch, I was enamored with the cinematography,  the storyline is captivating yet not unbelievably developed, and it gives audiences quite a bit to think about thematically. I think the reason some viewers of the film might be underwhelmed is because they go in expecting a violent, action-packed two hours. That is not this movie. The central characters and the limits/decisions they must consider to attain their desired success is focused on rather than the guns and murders. It is a wonderful and heavy movie that devotes most of its energy into making a dialogue-based drama that just so happens to take place in a violent backdrop. If you go in expecting that, you won't be disappointed.",1423267200,3,766,4.937984496124031

I can't imagine any fan of mob movies not being annoyed by this plodding, boring snoozer. All the ""Oh well, the clothes and scenery are great"" reviews from the artsy viewers confirm my point. The name is totally misleading, as are the pro reviews. So call it something else, and call it a big disappointment!!!",1423180800,6,638,4.605263157894737

6934104,2,B00RNELG5E,"Slow and depressing drama about a man who owns a growing heating oil company and bets everything he has on acquiring a new property that will give him a massive leg up on his competitors.  He has 30 days to come up with the balance after putting every penny he has into a non-refundable deposit but someone is hijacking his trucks and the feds are looking at bringing charges, which scares away his bank and any other legitimate financing options.

Oscar Isaac plays Abel Morales as someone who considers himself an honorable man who got where he is through honest, hard work but he has no idea what his wife, a mobster's daughter and the company bookkeeper has been doing behind his back.  He's ultimately very difficult to root for.  Richard Gere played a far less sympathetic businessman trying to complete a deal under the clock in Arbitrage but he's a charismatic enough actor to make you root for his character even though you knew you shouldn't.  Oscar Isaac simply doesn't have the screen presence necessary to make you care about his character and what he is attempting to do.  A young Robert De Niro circa Mean Streets and Taxi Driver would have killed in this part but Oscar Isaac isn't that type of actor and watching him becomes more drag than compelling after a while.

Jessica Chastain gives a strangely uninteresting performance as Abel's wife, the one with the mobster father who previously owned the business.  She insulates her husband so he can keep believing that everything his company is doing is honorable and above board--unfortunately her character is underwritten and doesn't give her much to work with.  The fact that they have two daughters is easy to forget since they are barely even in the movie.  If the excuse for Abel's obliviousness and moral compromises is that he is trying to build something for his family then it would have been nice for that family to make some sort of impression in the film.

A Most Violent Year takes place in 1981 which was statistically the worst year for New York crime, but period detail is non-existent.  This is a seriously disappointing movie.  There's simply no life or energy or momentum in A Most Violent Year--just a series of depressing choices that never add up to much of anything dramatically.",1422921600,4,2270,4.760204081632653
6934105,5,B00RNELG5E,"Theatrical review. May be spoilers.  I loved director/writer J. C. Chandor's earlier efforts (""All Is Lost"" and ""Margin Call"") and what's not to like about Oscar Isaac (""Drive"" and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") and Jessica Chastain (""Interstellar"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"")?  I couldn't wait to see this pseudo-mob movie.  The marketing of this film isn't exactly honest in the respect of heightening the suggestion of mob enforcement and violence.  And they make no secret that Chastain plays Anna Morales, a mobster's daughter who is married to Abel (Isaac), a Columbian-American.  Together they have 2 kids and have just moved into their dream home.

Abel conducts his business on the straight and narrow however.  He wants to run his heating oil business in a legitimate way. The film is set in New York in 1981, a year of high crime in the city.  A group of half a dozen companies compete for the business, and Abel's trucks and drivers have been targeted for hijacking.  While he contemplates how to react (the union boss wants to arm the drivers), Able is also in the middle of a transaction where he will purchase an unused riverfront plant.  It will dramatically increase his competitive position.  After putting down $30 thousand, he has only a few days to come up with the balance.  His banker has assured him of the money.  In spite of his unusual honesty, Able is also under investigation for supposed crimes by an ambitious D. A. (David Oyelowo, ""Selma"").  It is if everything is coming at him at once, including a surprise late in the film from his beloved wife.  Then one of his drivers gets into a gun fight defending himself, putting his loan in jeopardy.

Albert Brooks plays Abel's consiglieri, Andrew Walsh, who runs interference where ever he can.  I was a bit surprised that the film played straight with Abel's story and his faith in doing things honestly.  In a perfect role for Isaac, he reminds of Al Pacino in Godfather II.  Quiet, thoughtful and almost unassuming.  While his methods differ from Michael Corleone, they both are smart, innovative and determined.  Isaac and Chastain have great chemistry.  The look of NYC is somehow propelled back in time, with a bit more grime and grit.  Automobiles match the era, giving the film authenticity.  In addition to Isaac and Chastain, watch for Elyes Gable in a supporting role as Julian, one of Able's drivers.  He's terrific.  This is the best film Oscar ignored in 2014 and I highly recommend it.",1422748800,46,2466,4.825775656324582

This movie was slow and boring and had no real story line.  A waste of our money and time.  We and others in the theater were extremely disappointed.  Not sure how others on here are giving it 5 stars!  Granted there really was no violence in it so the title does not even tell you anything about the movie, but again, no real plot and you never really know anything about the characters.

6934107,5,B00RNELG5E,"Nine Things About the Movie ""A Most Violent Year""

1. Despite the title, this movie is not that violent. And it all takes place in 33 days. The title just means ""New York City, 1981"" because that's when the movie takes place, and it was one of the most violent years in New York History.

2. You could kind of call this movie ""The Anti-Godfather"".

3. It's about an immigrant, Abel, running an energy fuel company, slowly building his American Dream. Abel is trying to expand his dream honestly, even though he knows that he has to bend the rules sometimes. Unfortunately, his competitors are willing to bend more rules than he is.

4. When an ambitious district attorney comes after him for suspected illegal activities, Abel finds himself feeling pressure from every imaginable direction. He is forced into a series of decisions that will either chip away at his dream... or his ability to remain uncorrupted.

5. Abel, (played by Oscar Isaac, from ""Inside Llewin Davis""), is one of the most interesting characters I've seen in films for quite awhile. He's not a hero, nor is he an anti-hero. He can't commit enough to one side or the other. You never quite know if you're supposed to root for him or not.

6. Jessica Chastain is wonderful as Abel's wife, who provides more support to him than he wants to acknowledge. David Oyelowo (who will forever be known as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in ""Selma"") is excellent as the district attorney whose loyalty to justice serves his own ambition.

7. Even though this movie is over two hours long, and isn't focused on action, the script and the pacing is strong enough that things don't get boring.

8. There is also a constant, low-boil atmospheric tension throughout the film. As soon as Abel seems to have a plan for the current problem, others pop up. You can almost physically feel Abel's optimism and energy fade away.

9. This is a smart, well-told story. It's a gangster movie about not being a gangster. And it illustrates the idea that sometimes there are no right choices in life, so you have to go with your next-best choice.",1422662400,113,2085,4.659400544959128
