7371000,1,B013RZ7BUQ,"...what a seriously awful piece of what can be called nothing other than propaganda. Wow. This poor kid was NOT given proper direction in how to solve his physical problem and instead was led into a completely unnecessary surgery that will actually hurt him in the long run. The review I saw from a David R. Grant went into detail about what was wrong with it, I'll leave it to you to read it.

It's 2015. There are better and more effective solutions than amputation.",1450915200,9,468,4.5058823529411764
7371001,1,B013RZ7BUQ,"The screenwriter pushes total pro-circumcision myths and misinformation throughout this movie that's really more of an ad for circumcision. Early on he mentions seeing how painful circumcision seeing a man go through it on the internet and his friend says ""lucky him, it's better and you can last longer"". The lead puppet has phimosis which is non-retractable foreskin, this is rare (average age of full retraction is actually 10 years old based on a huge Swiss study of thousands of boys and there is no need to clean under the skin until it is actually retractable, another myth pushed in the movie) and when it does happen it is not a problem unless it is painful, many men enjoy the sensations of their phimosis. There is growing evidence that phimosis is actually cause by premature retraction of the foreskin which causes tears and scar tissue that halts the natural growth of the foreskin opening. Studies also show that steroid creams will fix nearly all patients when applied correctly as it is done completely incorrectly in the movie making the cortisone cream appear to be useless by the lead who is told by the ""doctor"" to masturbate with it rather than the appropriate treatment of putting a thin layer on the tip/ring of the foreskin and stretching the skin forward a few times a day.

There are multiple lines in this movie that make circumcision to be a wonderful gift in life whereas in reality it is mutilation that strips away tens of thousands of the most sensitive nerves (Meissner's corpuscles) and half the skin of the penis that makes sex much more pleasurable. 75% of the males on earth are intact (uncircumcised) and have no issues and their rates of all STD's (including HIV and HPV) are actually half that of the US whose adult male population is 70% circumcised. Circumcision is nothing but a Bronze Age holdover kept alive by religious and profit agenda.",1450915200,18,1885,4.8
7371002,1,B013RZ7BUQ,This movie is produced with Iranian (Muslim) and Jewish influences that are biased to make circumcision seem to be beneficial to avoid phimosis. When in actuality phismosis is very rare and can almost always be corrected without surgery. The producers had an agenda based on their cutting cultures.,1450828800,15,298,5.229166666666667

7371005,2,B013RZ7BUQ,"Short Skin takes an event that happens in every boys life and added a hint of humor to it. Puberty can be an awkward transition from boyhood to adulthood and nothing portrays it better than the uncomfortable reality of having to adapt to your changing body. Duccio Chiarini partnered with Gucci, bring Short Skin to life in an amazing portrayal of Edoardo by Mateo Creatini. Boys will be boys and director Chiarini gives us an insight into the head of a young man struggling with his family, his changing body, and his internal battle with getting a circumcision. As a young man who went through puberty long enough to laugh about it, but not long enough to forget all about it, I can relate to Edo because it was definitely a difficult time in life. When going through puberty, your body is susceptible to new experiences. And for Edo, who has phimosis, its very easy to be insecure. Overall it was a good, comical movie about an awkward event in every young person's life. It was very enjoyable.",1446422400,10,997,4.606741573033708

7371007,5,B013RZ7BUQ,"I gave this a 5 because it is a story that needs to be told.  The video starts with a father appropriately teaching his son how to properly clean his uncircumcised penis.  The son complains of it hurting but the parents pass it off as nothing.  However, the son could not pass it off because it was a real problem to him.  This concerns grew more and more, especially when puberty hit.  He knew his penis was different from his friends and he was ashamed and afraid.  Finally he got the courage to see a doctor who said his foreskin was way too tight and recommended circumcision.  The boy had already researched circumcision on the internet was scared because of the anti-circumcision propaganda that he had found.  Reluctantly, the doctor told the boy that he would give him some cream to try for 3 weeks.  The cream did not work so he finally mustered up the courage to tell him parents that he needed and wanted to be circumcised.  The parents were saddened that their son had gone all these years and not told them of his problem.  His parents quickly agreed to the circumcision and it was done.  This is where the makers of the video inserted some misinformation for the sake of drama.  After his circumcision, the video shows the boy in pain and staying the night in a hospital.  I was circumcised as a teenager and there was no hospital stay.  In fact, my whole procedure took only about 2 hours in an outpatient clinic and my pubes was not shaved as the video implies.  What pain there was lasted only about 2 days and it was easily controlled with pills.  I do agree with the video which shows the boy's speedy and complete recovery.  He was surprised when his doctor says that he can do anything he wanted because all his problems went away with his foreskin.  Only at this time do you see the boy smile.  He had gone through years of needless worrying.  Again I gave this video a 5 because there is a lot of truth in it.  Except for the exaggeration on the hospital stay, I would almost call this a documentary.  This video is much closer to the truth than the scare propaganda that is put out by the anti-circumcision people.",1454284800,7,2138,4.425641025641026
7371008,2,B013RZ7BUQ,I was expecting this  Italian film to be  great and funny. It wasn't. The subject  matter didn't  bother me like other  reviewers. Technical standards were high as was the acting.  I found that  the  screenplay was  too thin in context. More storyline would have been better. Quite honestly I found that most of the film to be very tedious.,1451520000,2,340,4.627118644067797

7371011,1,B013RZ7BUQ,"Very disappointed to see circumcision promoted in this film. Phimosis is not a reason to circumcise - there are far less invasive options that effectively solve the issue. Proper care in infancy and childhood prevents it altogether anyway.

7371015,1,B013RZ7BUQ,"Disappointing and stupid ""movie"". Why pay for a commercial that tries to talk you into having your penis mutilated? Do your research. Keep your WHOLE penis and recognize this propaganda for what it is.

The reason children are usually the victims of genital mutilation is that most adults have experienced the pleasure from their whole genitals and no one could talk them into having part of them cut off. Sadly those who have been cut as children are then psychologically driven to cut others. That's what's behind this propaganda. I saw this film with a friend who purchased it, he's sorry he wasted his money.

Save your money and your penis! Don't buy this crap!",1450915200,10,666,4.782608695652174

8728641,3,B013RZ7BUQ,"I would give this a better review than most gay films.  Putting aside the teenager's incredibly bad posture (can his head really be that hunchbacked from the rest of his body?), the film is an interesting view into contemporary upper-middle class Italian culture.  The beach scenes are great, the cinematography is excellent in general (giving a wonderful glimpse into the towns and coastal areas), and the movie doesn't preach or get bombastic.  This film actually reminded me of some of the early James Bond movies done on the Riviera in terms of its easy-going depiction of Mediterranean life and facile morality.  And of course the high school aged boy with a problem that could be easily fixed but that torments him unmercifully until he finally confronts it.  Highly recommended.",1509235200,,785,5.054263565891473

8728644,1,B013RZ7BUQ,I have nothing against gay videos or males of deficient genitalia (which the title of the movie inferred.) This is the worst gay video I have ever seen. The movie had a number of heterosexual scenes (no gay behavior). If curious rent before buying. There are better gay videos than this. My personal favorite is called North Sea Texas. This is a Belgium gay movie and I loved it. It is available for video streaming.,1481673600,,416,4.56
8728645,4,B013RZ7BUQ,"Don't understand the low rating.  The movie had beautiful filming, much about the Italian culture, even comedic moments.  There were points I was laughing out loud.  What we see is a very good movie on the life of a teen struggling with a foreskin that is too tight to retract for sex or even masturbation, his shame for his manhood, and ultimately how friends and family come to his support.  Given the low rating I was cautious to even buy the film.  Very glad I did, well worth adding to my collection.",1472515200,2,505,4.445652173913044

8728647,3,B013RZ7BUQ,"This movie seems to be getting lots of negative comments from people who think that it's propaganda in favor of routine circumcision. which certainly isn't a fair criticism, in my view. The doctor recommends circumcision only after less radical solutions have failed. The operation isn't trivialized (the protagonist ends up spending time in a hospital after complications set in). And the film assumes, like most Europeans, that the uncircumcised state is natural and normal. Be that as it may, however, this just was only a so-so movie: a routine coming of age story with not much dramatic tension. If it wasn't for its unusual gimmick, it would be hardly worth a glance.",1458172800,2,673,5.017857142857143
