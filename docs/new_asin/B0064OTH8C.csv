4952901,5,B0064OTH8C,"This is a very nice dvd, it shows how things in your life get out of hand when you think the grass is always greener on the other side of the road.  What you think is green just may be brown and the consequences are not always what you intend for it to be.  Be careful of who you think you have fallen in love with because love sometime is nothing but lust and harassment.",1331596800,3,372,3.9466666666666668
4952902,5,B0064OTH8C,I loved it. I thought Brain White did a great job and Clifton Davis still got it. Bravo Michelle Williams. All did a great job. This is a very good staged play.,1331596800,7,160,4.03125
4952903,4,B0064OTH8C,"I enjoyed the play for the most part.  I feel that Michelle articulated hers words throught the play a little too much and it kind of got annoying after so long.  When I first heard about the play Morris chestnut was supposed to be in it so I was a little disappointed but of course Brian did an awesome job in it either way.

I still enjoyed it overall and would have liked to see it live.",1331078400,2,390,4.038961038961039

4952925,4,B0064OTH8C,I love Michelle Williams and Brian White so it was a no brainier but I have to admit if I didn't know or like either one of them I probably wouldn't like it as much as I did. The storyline was OK but it was something about it that seemed a bit cheesy I went ahead and gave it 4 stars for the story which did get a little juicy at times and for the comedy but not everyone has the same taste in plays and movies so I could go on and on but my taste is different from others,1414368000,,472,3.6831683168316833

4952938,5,B0064OTH8C,"This was a very powerful play, which causes one to think, it should make married couples examine the amount of time that spend with each other and pay attention to one another",1395619200,,175,4.5
4952939,4,B0064OTH8C,"You wanna watch this to the end!!!!! Brian White is something else!!! Everyone did a good job. Do not watch plays a lot, but this was pretty good.",1395014400,,146,4.25
4952940,3,B0064OTH8C,"The reason why I even considered buying this DVD was because of Brian White.  I ended up not liking him in this film at all.  The play is quite funny through out and I really enjoyed Michelle's performance.  Clifton was quite funny and I kind of had a feeling he knew what Brian was up to.  Moody was very funny and had me cracking me up in his scenes.  To me this movie was definately comedy but in no way romantic.  They kind of had Brian acting like a maintenance man to Michelle's character but Brian came off completely physco and pathetic.  First of all Michelle was a married woman and yet Brian tries to sweep her of her feet.  Quite tacky.  Michele gives into his advances but it is  very short-lived.  Michelle had no real problems to begin with.  Brian was just crazy.  All the other actors did a good job but Brian to me was very unlikeable.  He was just mean, pushy, agressive and extremely disrespectful.  The storyline was decent but Brian's character to me just made this play very depressing.",1394755200,,1009,4.437158469945355

4952943,5,B0064OTH8C,This play was very good.  I highly recommend it because there is a lesson to learn in this play.  I will watch it over and over again.  It is now in my library.,1384300800,,160,3.787878787878788

4952946,5,B0064OTH8C,"I really enjoyed the plot of this movie. The suspense and guilt embedded into the plot made it extremely engaging and interesting. Michelle Williams' character is definitely a woman who has conflicting views about her love life, and Brian White's character does a great job augmenting that conflict.",1375228800,,299,5.25
4952947,5,B0064OTH8C,"I never knew Michelle could act, so I give her props for that. I loved Brian White's character, there are times I think they over acted, I also think they could have maybe taken out some parts and replaced with something else but the play really gives you a strong message. You do not want to miss out.",1372809600,,302,4.224137931034483
4952948,5,B0064OTH8C,"I'm a loyal fan of Tyler Perry, and I have given David E. Talbert a chance before, with a play that was one of his first. I was not a fan. This turned my opinion of him and his work around completely. I absolutely love Brian White and Michelle Williams does a pretty damn good job. It was a great story with a great twist, I truly did enjoy!",1372204800,,341,3.9565217391304346

4952953,5,B0064OTH8C,Don't be worried that this is a play and not a movie because it is amazingly well done.  It does explore the darker side of infidelity and its consequences.  Terrific production!  Kudos!!,1366588800,,187,4.78125
4952954,4,B0064OTH8C,"This is very interesting DVD. It is well-acted and its really ""food for thought"". I would recommend its purchase because not only is it entertaining, but it exhibits a ""moral compass"" that needs to be considered. Good Movie!",1365120000,,224,4.921052631578948

4952957,1,B0064OTH8C,"I originally purchased this DVD with the belief that it would be an entertaining, wholesome play with a Christ-centered message.  Well, I was absolutely wrong.
Like Tyler Perry, David E. Talbert's work has become more and more secular with every film.  I've been trying to focus on the positive message of his plays, while downplaying the ever-increasing infiltration of secularism that has characterized his work during the past several years.  Nevertheless, this play has brought to light Mr. Talbert's transformation as a playwright.
Simply put, this play contains more sexual innuendos, sexually explicit scenes, and foul language than any other so-called gospel play I've ever encountered.  Quite frankly, this play is filthy.  This is certainly not the kind of play you can watch with your children.  I watched the first 30 min and had to turn if off.
Perhaps I'm a bit up tight.  Nevertheless, when a product is marketed to Christian people and is written by someone who claims to be a follower of Christ, I believe it is reasonable to expect content that does not require the children to leave the room.
As people of God, we should have higher standards for the products that are sold to us.  Especially when they are marketed under the ""Christian"" or ""Gospel"" headings. Unfortunately, evil has become fair-seeming and we no longer care that it has become increasingly difficult for us to determine the difference between Christian products vs. products marketed to the secular world.
I used to be a supporter of David E. Talbert, but I can no longer patronize his plays/movies.  It's sad really, b/c there are very few options for people of God.  On the flip side, I'm sure that this will be one of Mr. Talbert's most popular plays and will likely out-sell all of his earlier and more reverential plays.  Unfortunate, but true.
Peace and Blessings.",1361059200,7,1857,4.958064516129032
4952958,4,B0064OTH8C,"I thought it was funny at times, but overall very good.  I thought this was a movie, not a play.",1360368000,,96,3.8
4952959,4,B0064OTH8C,"I enjoyed this play. Before I really get into this review, I should let you know that I have watched almost all of the Tyler Perry plays and have enjoyed almost all of them. This play, for me, is not up to that LOL standard, but then again, some of Tyler's new stuff isn't up to that standard either. With that said, this play was funny, and thoughtful without being too preachy or overly religious. I found that there were some slow moments in the film that I wanted to skip over, but that can be said for a lot of plays, books, and movies, for me. This play also had an all-star cast...I saw this play live in Philly and I think I enjoyed it more being in the audience than I did here. BTW this play is somewhat sexual in nature...maybe not for the little ones",1354406400,,762,4.155405405405405
4952960,3,B0064OTH8C,"It will be very hard to come up with 20 words to describe this movie. It would've done well to go to television instead, because to me it's just a TV movie. I could give a drama of my life that would be a little more entertaining and teach a lot better lessons. But then I don't have a David Tolbert to produce it. (Sigh)",1353715200,,321,3.953846153846154
4952961,5,B0064OTH8C,"I enjoyed DVD very much.  Talbert's plays are always very entertaining and this one is no exception.  The visual clarity andsound were excellent.  The actingwas ""on spot""  I highly recommend this one !",1345507200,,201,5.0
4952962,5,B0064OTH8C,"The plot was awesome! Clifton and Michelle were a believeable married couple! The outrageous best friend was perfect (we all know somebody like her lol) Moody was HI-LAR-IOUS!!!! And mm mm mm Mr Temptation was slick and delicious! The songs were awesome and appropriate for each character and the songs seemed to flow with the dialogue-rather than a song popping up out of nowhere. The set was immaculate! The wardrobe flawless. There was laughter, drama, wisdom, music, life issues...I absolutely loved this DVD. Its not dusty on my rack, I watch is often!",1344038400,,557,5.0
4952963,1,B0064OTH8C,"OMG!!! I mean what can I say about this play....hmmm.....boring, boring, boring. I'm not putting the seller down because it arrived ontime, and in new condition. It's just this movie is so boring, my fiance and I fell asleep on it woke back up and fell asleep on it again. Michelle Williams is a horrible actress...I'm sorry, Beyonce defently out does her in looks and acting,lol. I thought this movie would be good like Tyler Perry plays...no no no.....I'm sticking to my ""Madea""...don't waste your money, go and rent it from Blockbuster's or borrow it....you can have mine if you want, but don't spend money on it. I'm trying to sell it for $2.00 at a garage sell,seriously this play is sooooooo boring!",1341964800,,705,4.739837398373984
4952964,5,B0064OTH8C,"We just watched this on bet and wow, we just also placed our order for this movie earlier today before we knew it was coming on bet today. So we are so happy that we ordered this movie.. This was so good! We own several of David E Talbert's other plays which we love..

So now we really can not wait until we receive this play in the mail as we want to watch this over again. The plot was so awesome and so was the singing and acting.. We could not get enough of this play..

Well if you don't purchase this one, you will miss out.. This play was made and performed with such excellence.

Waiting on our's in the mail!

******Update******12/21/2011
Whew we have watched this play over so many times! That I had to come back and make an update... We are so enjoying the quality of this play. I love the message, the acting, the scenes and as far as the singing goes, I can not complain. I think Michelle Williams did as well as she was going to do. Maybe acting is more of her talent (All I know is that the song make me your number one, I would love to have that song on an album with Michelle Williams as the artist of the song. That song was so awesome and she did an excellence job!).

Over all, if you miss this play just because of the singing, you will miss out on the message, and the talent of David E Talbert. This will make a great gift, I wish that I would have ordered more.. But now I have a great gift idea, along with a great movie night for couples and just a girls movie night.

The emotions in this play are so reality, and I love the way that this play delivers the wisdom of the elders... Whew! This play even has some suspense in it and twist and flips.... The humor is also great.. For some good family entertainment, you can not ask for more.. I did not want the play to end!
We support this play and will continue to support his work..

The behind the scenes bonus features is also awesome and worth viewing. For me this play was and is reality... How often do you see beautiful African American couples successful and playing roles that are not full of violence... And as far as Moody... Whew bring it on... Keep Moody in the plays, We would love to see him and this whole cast in a sequel or just another subject matter with this very talented cast. Ann Nesby.. Whew....... How can anyone say anything negative about this play with all this great talent! Keep up the excellence that you so bring in all of your plays!

We now have all of his books and all of his plays except for the ones that have not been released. Keep up the great work and thanks for providing good family entertainment! Keep them coming!

Just in time for the holidays or anytime! So happy we placed this order! So much talent! Watch this with your husband and watch the forgiveness, temptation, strife, lessons, the time not spent at home, and the redemption, the storms of relationships.. this is reality... look at the divorce rate in the African American community we marry less but have the highest divorce rate.. (something to think about).....The grass is not greener on the other side... as it has to be mowed and trimmed just as well and it also is dormant during seasons and it withers, so if you want some powerful lessons, great music... This is for you! i mean the music has Brent Jones how could you not like what Brent Jones puts out...and many more music talents!

This play is great food for thought, I would love to see this as a movie!

Now back to more watching over and over, roll on the floor laughs, and inspiration!

Enjoy! We sure are.. Sing Ann Nesby! Michelle Williams! Amen Clifton Powell! Whew!

********6/9/2012****update
We are still watching this and it is still funny, roll on the floor laughs, and entertaining! We have shared this play with our family and they love it as well.. We can not wait on the soundtrack to this play to come out!

Moody is still funny even several months later from when we first saw this play..
If you have not purchased this play, you are missing out.

Back to more great singing, humor and a beautiful stage set and great acting!",1340755200,2,4092,4.309895833333333
