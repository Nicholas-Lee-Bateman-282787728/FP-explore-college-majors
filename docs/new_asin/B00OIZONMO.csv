6752554,5,B00OIZONMO,"SO CHUFFED WITH THIS box set!

This is a bang on BALLET WORKOUT that covers the exercises dancers do on a regular basis to get strong and toned.

The workouts are so clearly set out and demonstrated (the advantages of Victoria Marr and Flik Swan being trained professional ballet dancers) so you don't need to have danced before to do them as they guide you through it and I like the intro they do that runs through the ballet positions before you start cos this is great for beginners and also for more intermediate and advanced people who want to sharpen their technique. Their presentation is so classy too.... effortless, beautiful British-ness! Not patronising or intimidating.

Big advantage - there's TONS of content on the 3 discs with shorter and longer workouts which you can mix and match so you get a lot of bang for your buck!

I danced a bit when I was young and I bought this for my sister in law as a Christmas present so I could try it myself (running/gym isn't the same) My sis in law IS NOT a dancer but she has been doing the Sleek Technique streaming videos for a while and raves about how they make her feel. We've both been doing the Ballet Bootcamp workouts for two weeks now and to say we TOTALLY LOVE them is an understatement - (NB a warning though, you WILL ache the day after! LOL!!.....but that's the point!)

All in all a FIRST CLASS DVD set, you will not be disappointed.

10 out of 10........ 5 STARS!",1420934400,13,1434,4.412878787878788
6752555,2,B00OIZONMO,"I give two stars because I have to say that the form IS GOOD. but not challenging.

I do ballet beautiful workout everyday 3 h, and nto dvds but the Customer workout online streaming videos. Thereby I am far too strong and trained, and this is not even touching me at all. AFTER 3 weeks break from my injury I still did not find myself challenged.

Stretching is good, but If you are an athlete and thing to use it for recovering..maybe btu I Preferred Elise Golan Element Ballet conditioning. I felt it more in my butt and legs than this. This has few few focus oon butt..there are squats but again doing the 1 h barre I found it too easy!

Obviously the two ladies must do hours of much more than this to get those legs muscles..Sorry But I disagree with misleading that by doing this you get those muscles.

I am a professional athlete and those legs come with far harder work than those 20 minutes each...last part of which is stretching etc..AGAIN TOO LIGHT ON THE MUSCLES FOR TRAINED PEOPLE.

Ballet beautifulis FAR MORE DEFINING AND CHALLENGING AND IT WORKS REALLY HARD ON EACH MUSCLE.

NO COMPARISON. BB FOR EVER",1420675200,20,1120,4.465686274509804
6752556,5,B00OIZONMO,"Very nice set -- not too easy and not too difficult.  Just right.  And quite unique -- in terms of exercises and music.  The music is classical, but oh so inspiring.  Before you know it - you get so absorbed by the exercises and the music that it does not feel like you're working out.  I don't do these every day, and sometimes will do a few segments at the end of other exercises and it leaves me feeling like I've danced.  Quite inspiring in that respect.",1419552000,7,458,4.206896551724138

6752558,5,B00OIZONMO,"I loved the Sleek Technique online workouts so much that I bought a home ballet barre to use with them.  I find Victoria and Flik to be extremely motivating and positive, with workouts that go by very quickly but are deceptively difficult.  I had high hopes for this DVD set and was not disappointed.  They are very detailed with their explanations, and each DVD has a tutorial that explains all the positions, the proper form, and goes into detail for any more complicated movements.  Each DVD also includes a warm-up and a cool-down.  Keep in mind that all of these are options on the menu, so if you really want to you can skip these.  Depending on the DVD, there are three or five different workouts.  These can be done concurrently, but they all work as standalone workouts, so you needn't feel like you're skipping large chunks if you choose to just do one of them.  I was previously a fan of another ballet workout before getting into Sleek Technique, but I just love the pace and the vibe of these, and the personalities of Victoria and Flik, so much that this is definitely my number one favorite now.",1416960000,14,1110,4.542713567839196
6752559,5,B00OIZONMO,"I don't do reviews and I don't do video workouts, but for this? I'll make an exception.  It's really THAT good.  Believe me when I say, anything that can actually get me motivated enough to look forward to working out deserves a 5 star review! The best part is that with these 20 minute ballet blasts, you can piece together a tailor made workout suited specifically for what your body and your schedule allows.  I would have paid this price and felt like I got my money's worth with just one of the discs, but for three separate discs?  Are you seriously still wasting your time reading this??? Well, all I can say is thank you to these two pro's for a Ballet Bootcamp that will kick my buns into shape (and I'm not talking about the ones you wear in your hair!) just in time for Christmas, and for the added bonus of helping me decide what I'm getting everyone else for pressies!",1416787200,11,881,4.353658536585366
6752560,5,B00OIZONMO,"I don't do reviews often, but I have got to say that I absolutely LOVE this DVD set.  I have plenty of other barre/ballet style workouts and this one is so unique.  The time just flew by because it was so fun and different.  I am excited to see what type of results I get from this workout.  Some of the other barre/ballet workouts that I have tried is Ballet Beautiful, Ballet Body, The Ballet Physique, Barre3, Bar Amphed, Squeeze, Xtend Barre, Element Ballet Conditioning, Tracey Anderson Method, and Pop Physique-as you can see I love anything barre!  I definitey think that these will stay in my rotation.  I may alternate these with Ballet Beautiful-since I think that Ballet Beautiful sometimes can be a litte more boring and I am hoping this will bring some excitement into my routine.  I plan to update once I see some results.",1416355200,53,836,4.608108108108108
6752561,5,B00OIZONMO,"AWESOME DVD set! It's extremely UNIQUE!!!The exercises are challenging but fun to do. They  are broken into 10-20 min blasts which is essential in our busy lives.

I noticed a difference in how I felt (and how my clothes fit!) after only a few times. All three dvds are good. The workouts are in 10 and 20 minute segments, so you can do one or all, or mix them up. The warm up and cool down alone are good for a day when you don't have much time.

It helps to have a ballet background, to avoid injury and to maximize effect. These women are strong, encouraging, and professional. And I don't mind if my young kids watch or join in. Favorite DVDs for me in the past have been NYC Ballet 1 and 2, Ballet Yoga, Suzanne Bowen Long Lean Prenatal, Leah Sarago Warrior Workout, and everything by Karen Voight.

6752578,5,B00OIZONMO,"I was looking to change up my exercise routine and having done some beginner ballet classes years ago decided to give this a try.
The DVD includes a short segment where the instructors explain the foot position and arm position, recommend if you have never done ballet or as a good reminder.  Each disc also has a five minute warm-up (it is the same warm up routine on all three discs and is not counted as one of the work outs).  I completed the first work outs on the Boot Camp and Barre Technique and was not disappointed.  The work outs are at a good pace that get your heart rate up and work the muscles, my legs were pretty sore the next day. If you have knee problems I do suggest you use a brace or skip this work out because there are a large number of squats and plies.  My daughter took ballet for 15 years and gave me an eye roll when I suggested she try it out.  She did the first Boot Camp and was also impressed with the workout she got in the 20 minutes and commented the next day her legs were sore.  I will probably do the first work outs on the discs a couple more times and then give workout two a try.  The body sculpt has two ab work outs: a standing and a floor-the two compliment each other and I think will be very effective. I haven't tried the leg or arm sculpt yet, feeling those may be good on days that I didn't just put my legs through the boot camp and barre.",1490054400,2,1391,4.054744525547445
6752579,1,B00OIZONMO,I am extremely disappointed with these DVDs.  They are very difficult to follow with poor instruction.  It seems that rather than being a workout that they are more like a recital for the instructors.  I would not recommend these to anyone who wants to workout.,1489190400,6,261,4.7555555555555555
6752580,5,B00OIZONMO,Finally found a ballet workout I LOVE!! I was a ballerina (back in the day) and have always enjoyed fitness dvd's that had a ballet/dance influence in them but always wanted a more pure version. I even ordered a 4' free-standing ballet barre so I am able to truly practice it perfectly...hooray!!! :D,1486425600,4,300,4.679245283018868
6752581,5,B00OIZONMO,"These workouts are absolutely amazing. I highly recommend them. The production quality is excellent and the design of the sequences is wonderful. Flik and Victoria, the creators of the technique and instructors on the DVDs, are professional dancers and it is clear just from looking at them that they know their stuff when it comes to getting into excellent physical shape. Not only that, but they really seem to understand what it takes to make not only a fantastic workout but a fun one to boot. I can't really say what it is, but these two ladies have a charm and appeal that comes across through the screen, making you want to work harder and do their workouts every day. What I love the most about these DVDs is that they truly use ballet-based sequences that are incredibly effective at sculpting a long, lean body while being very enjoyable to do.  I really feel like I am gracefully dancing more than just plodding through a pseudo-ballet cardio routine in a tutu.

The first DVD is 3 ""bootcamp""-style workouts, each lasting approximately 20 minutes. I hesitate to use the term ""bootcamp: because these fun and dance-like segments do not have much in common with the grueling and boring bootcamp workouts I have done in the past except for the fact that they get your heart rate up, make you sweat and get your muscles strengthening and stretching. The second DVD is all barre workouts and is equally as excellent. You don't sweat and work as hard in terms of cardio, but your strength and flexibility are definitely challenged. The third DVD is a series of 10 minute workouts for various problem areas (legs, abs, arms) and is also very effective and fun to do. I love the variety of exercises that these workouts offer and the fact that I can easily mix and match the three DVDs to keep my body guessing. Some have mentioned that the warm up and cool down are the same for all three DVDs and that they would have preferred each DVD to have its own. However, I actually find it helpful since it allowed me to quickly learn the sequences of exercises and stretches.

The only problem I could see with these DVDs is that the workouts may be too difficult for someone just beginning to exercise or who is very overweight. In those cases I think that the Miranda Esmonde-White's Classical Stretch workouts (particularly Season 9 or 11) would be an excellent place to begin. I started out last year (in my attempt to lose my last 10 pounds of baby weight after my fourth child) with Classical Stretch/Essentrics and am happy to say that thanks to CS/Essentrics my transition to the Sleek workout was challenging but achievable. Had I started out with the Sleek workout, I might have felt a little too challenged. My only other complaint is that the lovely Flik and Victoria have not put out any other DVDs. They do offer live classes and streaming on their website (and I hope to definitely try those options in the near future), so I don't imagine that they will be producing any other DVDs unfortunately. I do thank them immensely though for for producing this stellar DVD collection. Please make another one so I can buy it straight away!",1484438400,8,3145,4.642728904847397
6752582,5,B00OIZONMO,Excellent workout...,1483747200,3,20,9.5
6752593,5,B00OIZONMO,"I am no ballerina, but I am a ballet barre enthusiast and love ballet inspired workouts.

I workout every day 1 or 2h. Coming from MHB, Kari Anderson, Jennifer Galardi, Bernadette Giorgi, Burr Leonard and Ellen Barret's DVDs, it took me some time to get into Sleek. This is much more balletic than ballet toning / ballet inspired gym DVDs. True MHB did some balletic DVDs, but I didn't get to tune in with them. Instead, with Sleek Technique  it took me a couple of weeks to tune in and love bloomed :)

With these three DVDs, you sweat, elongate, develop deep muscle without getting bored, grow balance, grace, improve posture. Music is great and even if I am no fan of voice over, it makes sense that when the instructors perform certain series, they cannot have enough breathe to properly comment and guide. It's much cleaner and precise with voice over.

I rotate my ballet toning DVDs during the week and practice on Sleek on Fri, Sat and Sunday. I still feel some of the other DVDs I practice are a useful complement to these three (e.g. MHB does an outstanding job on ballet body muscle toning and shaping, though the amount of reps is numbing. I practice w/ her for the results and thumbs up on her for that, though enjoy Sleek much better).

After a few consistent months of practice, I still feel excited to hit these DVDs, as the more I get into the moves, the better I enjoy them!

It is true that certain sections are fast and you may lose precision in the moves if you want to stick to the pace if you are not trained st certain moves, but I realized that with focus and practice my muscles and posture are really getting to understand the moves and catch up with the pace without compromising the alignment. It's a progressive improvement, so if you feel the same, just stick to your practice! It'll come! I'll keep on practicing to improve (especially the arabesques sequences on Bootcamp).

Pro: instruction is clear, instructors are professional and so inspirational! Music is great,  sequences also. These DVDs do deliver results and cuts while enjoying. From a non ballerina, but a rather a ballet-lover point of view, after some good practice, they do make you feel closer to ballet than you may imagine.

Con: as other reviewers already mentioned, the DVDs are split into sections which cannot be played in sequence. It'd be nice to have the option to press on play for the entire workout. I'd also find it great if the DVDs had a music-only option to see if without instruction I am able to keep the pace. Last, warm up and cool down is the same in each DVD. I like both sections, though it'd be good to vary.

I have to say that these cons are small details to me, as I do enjoy these workouts. They are different from what you may find on the market, there are enough ballet elements to make you feel you are dancing, yet they are accessible to non-ballet dancers.

If I had a good connection I would love to stream or join Victoria's and Flik's live classes. Hope I will one day!

Thanks Victoria and Flik to deliver results with such enjoyable workouts! My body and spirit are so greatful to both of you and it's a pleasure to give you 5 stars!",1476576000,19,3171,4.476603119584055
6752594,5,B00OIZONMO,"I love these workouts and the dancers are wonderful. I bought the 3 dvd set after using the sleek technique ballet workout for several months. The other two add in other types of dance and more exercises. All three are different, challenging and fun. The voice over is calming with clear instructions for novice dancers.",1472515200,6,320,4.836363636363636
6752595,4,B00OIZONMO,Great workout.  I c enjoyed these a lot.  Originally I also got a bar but returned it.  Can totally do these with a sturdy chair.,1469923200,6,129,4.08
6752596,5,B00OIZONMO,"I attend a ballet class as an adult ballet student and this by far is the best ballet video I have tried.  I feel it is better in many ways than a class. You not only get the sleek elegance of a ballet body but an amazing cardio workout that I did not expect after trying other ballet videos that were just tedious and repetitive. These ladies know what they are doing. Expect to sweat and feel great afterward.  On the other hand, it would perhaps be beneficial if you have some elementary ballet training, as they do move quickly.  But, their videos are still excellent as an overall excercise workout with or without ballet training.  The videos have 3 bootcamp workouts, 3 barre workouts, and 5 bodysculpt workouts for specific areas. The fact that you can mix them up and do as many as you want depending on time and areas you want to work on makes this set fun and interesting. And, with effort you do get the results you want.  I also like the fact that there is a warm up and cool down on all the videos that you can add to your workout. Amazing product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1468540800,11,1076,4.36
6752597,2,B00OIZONMO,"I was disappointed with this dvd.  First, I felt that I wasted my time doing it - barely broke out a sweat or got my heart rate up.  Secondly, it is a voice-over format, which is not my favorite.  The woman speaking has a rather formal British accent (read snobby), which is also not my favorite.  One of the 3 dvds has a barre workout that is downright annoying.  A professional barre is used, which cannot be moved.  So when it's necessary to shift to a different side to work your body evenly, the two dancers turn their backs to you the whole time!  So confusing!  They must be aware that the people watching the dvd are using a chair, which can easily be moved from one side to the other.  They should have used a chair, too, to make the workout easier to follow.  I also didn't appreciate the dancer doing the voice-over talking about herself, saying that if we followed her routine, we, too, could have a beautiful dancer's body. I found it to be rather obnoxious bragging.  So, for the price that I paid, I do regret my purchase.  I will only use this dvd when I am having a really bad day, and need a very easy routine.",1466726400,5,1128,4.268867924528302

6752599,5,B00OIZONMO,"Amazing workout for busy working gals! The ""Boot Camp"" discs make you sweat and feel so good! The warm-up, boot camp and cool-down equates to a nice 30 min exercise. Lots of variety in the 3 discs so you don't get bored doing the same routines all the time. Good to watch through first and then follow along. Some of the moves require at least some knowledge of ballet. As an adult beginner to ballet, I find this to be a fun exercise that satisfies my need to want to dance. Professional ballerinas work very hard but this DVD gives you a taste of what it is like. Wonderful production and great instructor duo! Brava!",1464998400,11,619,4.391304347826087
6752600,5,B00OIZONMO,"I have several of the classic ballet workouts (New York City Ballet Workouts 1 & 2, Ballet Workouts 1 & 2, Ballet Conditioning). I love all of them, because ballet is one of the few fitness techniques that can actually look pretty while getting some serious work done. So far, this three-DVD Sleek Technique set is my favorite. Here's why:
1.  As with all of the best videos I've mentioned, these workouts feature classic ballet moves; it's not just ballerinas doing calisthenics as I have seen on some videos.
2.  There are 12 workouts in all to meet the basic fitness goals: strength, flexibility, balance and cardio. You can mix and match as desired.
3.  The workouts are challenging enough for people who have been exercising for years, but the movements themselves are easy enough for a beginner to follow. The level you work out at is determined strictly by your own fitness level.
4.  While some of the classic moves repeat from workout to workout, there's enough variety to make each one unique.
5.  This is one of the few ballet workout videos I've seen that works the upper body as well as the lower.
6.  The ballerinas themselves are inspiring: they have exquisite bodies and move beautifully.
7.  There's a really fun showgirl routine included in this set.
8.  Voiceover instructions are clear and easy to follow, offering significant guidance on proper technique.
9.  It doesn't hurt at all that both voiceovers speak in cultured British accents. It's a pleasure just listening to them.

In short, I'm a fan! If this team ever creates a second video, I'll definitely buy it.",1464566400,20,1587,4.78021978021978

6752602,5,B00OIZONMO,"I really really love these dvds. They are hands-down my favorite workout dvds. I have used Ballet Beautiful and Tracey Mallett barre and ""Ballet"" workouts, and these are really so much more fun, gentler on the joints, and truly transformed my physique. Mallett's dvds went a long way to begin my toning journey, but I ended up with achey knees because of all the ""plies"" where you keep your heels together and go up on your toes (SOOOO bad for your knees!). So, I bought these, hoping to get ballet toning with better technique. I could not be happier. I dropped a pants size in about 3 months (without diet) doing these 2-4 times per week, rotating each dvd, and using the entire length of the dvd (so about an hour). They gradually, gently tone your entire body, using wonderful technique that is really gentle on the joints. I also like the music, and the fact that it is voiced-over, instead of having some perky, random comments thrown out there to hear over and over. Victoria and Flik stay focused on the workout (no weird comments, so nothing to get annoyed by.) After cleaning up my diet this year (2016), and continuing to use these dvds, I dropped another 20 pounds and another pants size. And my body has reshaped and reformed in all the right places, and my posture has improved. I am considering streaming their workouts online and paying a monthly fee because I love these workouts so much. I really could not recommend these enough.",1461196800,19,1448,4.616279069767442

6752611,5,B00OIZONMO,"I couldn't wait to review this, but I gave it several days, did a variety of the workouts, and watched several others first, to be most useful.

Wow.

This is the most beautiful, most incredible workout I've ever seen. Exceptionally challenging, and I say that as a person to whom form is everything. If your form isn't correctarms aren't lifted as high, leg not as high, toe not pointed, leg not flexedyou're not getting the full challenge of the workout. (And you risk injury.)

I don't have a ballet background, or dance background of any kind. My typical workouts were Cathe Friedrich high-intensity step, interval training, jogging, power walking, yoga, and resistance training with weights, but that was 10+ years ago. After a sedentary period and several starts and stops, I've been more recently doing walking/jogging (though bored with the treadmill in the cold weather), yoga, and pilates. Currently, I'm into various yoga DVDs, this workout, some qigong, and tai chi with my boyfriend.

I wondered how challenging and ""complete"" a ballet workout would be, and how appropriate to my fitness goals. I ultimately chose it for something necessarily low-impact, as I'm extremely stiff (especially upon first rising), have EXCEPTIONALLY tight and painful hips, and over the past several weeks, am just getting back into a regular (5xs/wk) fitness routine (from a 2-3xs/week one).

Also, a test for rheumatoid factor just came back positive, and my hips are always quite sore in these last few months, and cracking, popping, or being otherwise inflexible and generally disagreeable. I needed something I could do at my own level while I build up my fitness AND flexibility levels. This turned out to be perfect.

PROS:

1. The dancers are very different, so you'll likely find a match for your personal style.

I didn't realize it at first, but the little one is very elegant, always with the flourish. (The deliberate way she points and flexes her beautiful feet reminds me of a lovely flower bud opening.) The taller one is very strong, athletic, and super-precise. (If I want to check my form or anticipate the next move well, I watch her. See more below, in Cons, on cueing.)

Because I'm new to ballet, I was very envious of the elegance of the little one and would try to match her moves in those workouts that contain them both, but this was just because the flourish always caught my eye.  This was the wrong move for me (no pun), because I'm tall (6'0"") and have an athletic build. I'm also more a precision dancer than an elegant one, though people always kind enough to share that they find me graceful.

(Well, they should've seen me in my first few attempts at this: I looked like a flailing fish trying to flag down a bus.)

2. Nine different workouts, one warmup, and one cool down provide great variety.

The different TYPES of workouts provided here are fantasticbarre, (stability, balance, and sculpting), sculpt (flexibility and sculpting), and bootcamp (power, and sculpting)and give you options for beginning, no matter your level, or the style you desire.

One reviewer mentioned that she'd prefer a different warmup per workout... I can understand getting bored with it eventually. I'm having so much fun so far, now that I've begun to anticipate the moves; it's a little dance routine and I feel amazing. Over time though, I'll probably start doing a short yoga first as a warmup. Now, I do a little tai chi even before the warmup, (NECESSARY to loosen me up enough to even attempt to do these moves).

3. You become more flexible *while* you're becoming stronger.

Strength and flexibility go hand in hand. When you do the research, you find that you become more flexible more quickly by incorporating strength exercises into your routine. I love that this ends up building both at once without me realizing it until later. 

4. The music is moving and fun, and elegant and classical, each when appropriate.

If a workout doesn't have good music, I'm not likely to be able to do it much. (There are world-class musicians in my family, and I'm no slouch myself in this regard.) Just as another reviewer stated, the music is GOOD and perfect for the workouts.

5. The ladies are lovely to look atand to listen to.

I love their personalities, unique individual styles, and chemistry together.

CONS:

1. It moves too fast if you're inflexible. Careful.

This is not really a con. If it were slower, and I were of normal flexibility, I would be painfully annoyed. This is just something I personally must work up tofor instance, I've never been able to turn my feet out to properly plieso I mention it for others like me.

2. The cueing is often in time WITH the moves instead of a beat ahead, making following along difficult.

Another reviewer mentioned the ""exceptional cueing"" (or something to this effect), and I purchased with this as the final factor. (I can't do Jillian Michaels' workouts, for instance, because she is always, always, always horribly and quite obviously off-beat with the music. Not to mention annoying.)

I definitely wish the cueing *stayed* a beat ahead of the moves in this wonderful workout, instead of only being so most of the time. But because of the flourish of the littler dancer, I tend to keep my eye on the stronger dancer to ensure I stay on point. (Dang it, no pun.)

3. I wish there were more workouts with the two of the dancers together.

This is more preference than a con. It would just help me because it's more useful to model the moves of the dancer that shares my body type.

SUMMARY:

Sure, I had and have to pause occasionally to see what the move just was, or to rest my poor glutes, shoulders, etc., before I can transition to the next move, but that's what I expect for a challenging workout that I'll be able to GROW with. I honestly can't say enough about this stellar workout. I can't wait until I'm in better shape and have less pain to do this workout justiceand vice versa.",1452643200,26,5960,4.746124031007752

They're way more fun than any other ballet barre classes I've done on youtube and are easy to do, yet challenge the body.

6752634,5,B00OIZONMO,"wanted a workout DVD that would get me excited to workout in the morning and I found it with this box set!

I have been using these DVDs for the past 3 weeks about 4-5 days per week, and I am seeing some results especially in my legs. I haven't used the barre workout DVD much because I don't have a barre yet (ordered one from Amazon yesterday) and the stools I have didn't suffice for the workout (I tried it), so I have been doing one of the three boot camp workouts and one of the five body sculpt segments each morning I workout (in total it constitutes a 30 minute workout).

I am an average fitness level, 57 and 130 lbs, and I have to say that a lot of the sequences are very quick and there is not much explanation other than ballet terminology (which I was not familiar with before this DVD set), but when I started I just pushed through it and tried my hardest and now I am getting pretty close to being able to keep up with Flik and Victoria.

I love this box set so much that I am going to subscribe to the sleektechnique website so I can have access to their live classes and streaming videos.",1449705600,9,1107,4.1157407407407405

6752637,5,B00OIZONMO,"This is the exact dance/ballet workout video I've been waiting for. Mine set just arrived, and I've only done the body sculpt one so far, but this is the EXACT workout I feel has been missing in the ""ballet"" workout video genre. I loved it! I have many ballet barre videos, and this is the first one that feels like real dance exercises combining strengthening within real dance movements. It's modern, and the music is soothing but somehow high energy at the same time. It just has a hip, contemporary feel to it. The setting and filming and sound is top notch.

Some of my barre videos are just glorified used-up floor exercises like crunches and bridges, done in a leotard with piano music in background. This video however opens right up with warmup exercises commonly done in my real dance classes, and continues with incorporating real dance moves. Other ballet exercise videos I have are wonderful, but they're basically focused on doing plies while working the core; or other good, but less fun and not so dancy movements.

This video is constantly changing what you're doing, so it's impossible to get bored. It's done in a voiceover which usually I hate because it feels so impersonal. This however is done so impeccably, the timing and cueing so perfect, that I was many minutes in before I even notice it was a voiceover.

One thing I will say, at least the body sculpt video was not that challenging. I haven't exercised in almost 3 months, so I'm just getting back into it, and I was able to do the entire video through first time. So if you're in great shape already and workout hard, this could be a good ""off day"" mellow workout; or a great door-in if you're just getting into working out and need to ease in.

All in all, I feel this video is filling an enormous gap in the world of ballet exercise videos...that of real ballet dancers combing real dance movements into the exercises, and using inspirational, upbeat music. I can't recommend this video enough, and I'd buy anything these two produced! (Will update this review if I have more to say after doing the other two)",1445212800,28,2093,4.618279569892473

6752639,5,B00OIZONMO,"I was a complete and total couch potato and looking to get healthy and lose weight when I started using the Ballet Beautiful videos by Mary Helen Bowers and loved them; building up muscle tone without bulking, and being able to do them in short segments was great. When I started looking for more variety the Sleek Technique videos were suggested on Amazon, so after reading some of the reviews and checking out some of the workouts on YouTube, I decided to get this DVD set. Its a fantastic workout!

Another reviewer mentioned that you have to be careful in making sure that your form is correct and Ive also found that to be true. When I first started doing them I couldn't keep up with the pace they set so I did the same exercises but at a much slower pace. I learned the proper form for them while still building up the muscles needed even though I didn't initially get the cardio workout. Once I was used to the movements I could speed up and get a great cardio workout, and it was well worth the effort. I second the idea that its nice to see them breathing harder and sweating; its encouraging to know that even professional ballerinas can still get something out of these workouts.",1443398400,13,1191,4.438356164383562

6752645,5,B00OIZONMO,"I really love this DVD set! The Ballet Bootcamp and Ballet Barre dvds are broken up into three 20 minute workouts each, and the last dvd, the Ballet Total Body Sculpt, is a series of five 10 minute workouts. The bootcamp dvd is more much more cardiovascular than the barre dvd, and the sculpt dvd falls somewhere in between. This gives you the option of mixing and matching depending on time and what you want to focus on. The barre and bootcamp workouts are all total body, whereas the sculpt dvd segments are focused on certain areas, like abs, arms, legs, etc. The ""warmup"" is a little over 5 minutes long, and is the same on all the dvds. The same goes for the cooldown, which is also 5 minutes long, and the same on all dvds. They recommend you do the cooldown twice, beginning on alternating sides. I wish they had filmed it so that we only had to go through it once. I have no problem with a ten minute cooldown, but it seems like it could have been planned better so both sides are addressed in one go, with longer time spent stretching.

Flik and Swan are elegant and upbeat as instructors, and their cueing is supportive and encouraging. The workouts include real ballet vocabulary and are fun and challenging to do. Sometimes the change between movements is pretty fast, but after doing the dvds a few times, you'll get the routine and get more out of the workouts. Overall, I feel that these are a great value for the price: fun, effective, and affordable. Thank you Flik and Victoria!",1438387200,9,1497,4.483516483516484
6752646,5,B00OIZONMO,"I've recently been hooked on Xtend Barre ""Lean and Chiseled,"" and The Bar Method, and I decided to give this set a try, seeing as how my favorite part of Barre has been the ballet. Here's my input: The two people who have rated it 1-star (so far) probably did NOT have their form anywhere close to right. I have had to spend so much time focusing on proper form, because if you don't have much of a dance background (such as myself), the proper form doesn't really come natural. It is not hard on the knees at all; in fact, quite the opposite, as I have very sensitive knees and can't do many workouts because of it. As for not being challenging enough? Again, get your form right before deciding. Getting the form right can take several tries... It is plenty challenging; even the professionals on the video are sweating during some of the workouts! Another review stated that it was too fast. Yes, they move quickly. Again, if you are patient and stick with it, after a few tries, each workout will feel like the perfect pace. I love how these workouts truly stretch out the body and build lean muscle... Without any weights! Just your body. I think the moral of the story is that these workouts may for some be too hard at first, and for others, seem to easy. Of course, everyone is different, and entitled to their opinion, but I would urge each buyer to stick with it and try their best to focus on the proper form (which to me is the hardest part), and I think you will be pleased with the results.

Edit: I've been using this DVD set exclusively for over 3 months now, about 4x/week. I haven't changed my diet, other than drinking more water and watching my carb intake (watching... not eliminating)! Everyone who sees me comments on how I have leaned down, or how my arms look chiseled, or how my waist is so trim. This set WORKS! People always say weight loss/maintenance is about 80% what you eat, but if you eat even somewhat right, you're going to notice a HUGE change in your body after a few months with these workouts!",1438128000,34,2033,4.406914893617022

6752666,5,B00OIZONMO,"In the past few weeks this workout set has become one of my all-time favorites. I am not a dancer but enjoy dance/barre inspired exercise. My favorite for the last several years had been Ballet Beautiful, but I think I like Sleek a bit better now. These workouts have a different musical and visual feel from BB. Also, at first I didn't ""feel"" the exercises the same way you feel a BB workout, but as I have kept at them, I have noticed great results - stronger core, waist pulling in, more definition in my leg muscles. To me, the workouts are more subtle than BB and more focused on form and fluidity. The pacing and cuing are great, the energy is fun, and I actually feel like I am almost dancing instead of just doing fancy crunches or jumping jacks. When I don't get to workout I actually feel a bit cheated. :) The individual workouts are designed with different objectives, but in my opinion, each disc seems to offer just enough cardio and toning. I also really love the personalities of Victoria and Flik; they're a perfect balance of energy and excitement without being too ""rah-rah"" for my taste. Effective, efficient, fun, and so classy.

I have no regrets about this purchase. I only wish they made more DVDs; their online streaming options are out of my budget as we are a young-ish family with a lot of diapers to buy. If these ladies made more DVDs I would not think twice about investing in those. I should add that I am in very average shape, no athlete here, just a mom trying to work on a post-couple-of-babies-body.

6752667,5,B00OIZONMO,"Recently, I have been opting for more fitness DVDs that fuse Ballet, Pilates, Yoga, and Dance into one workout. It took me years, and a lot of money spent on fitness DVD's to find what I am most likely to stick with, and it's DVDs that are based on my interests; dance... I do not have any background in dancing whatsoever but I it's the one type of workout that gets me moving without the dread factor of exercising. Anyway, I read the reviews on this DVD and decided to buy it. WHAT A SMART MOVE!!! This is a doable challenging fitness DVD. I love the fluidity of the movements, the scenery, and the fact that I get to challenge my body without wishing I had taken a dance class first.  I've always admired ballet dancers' bodies, and I feel confident that this collection will allow me to tone, lose weight, and gain some flexibility while developing a feminine physique, which is my overall goal. I have well over 100 fitness DVD's and I'd say this collection falls within my top 5.

The set comes with three DVDs.  Two of them have three 20 minute workouts; one using the barre, and the other three sets without the barre.  Then there's one DVD that comes with six 10 minute exercises that targets different parts of the body. I love the standing abs section. I am not one to get on the floor and do crunches, planks or any ab floor exercises so this one is perfect for me.

While I enjoyed the workouts, there was always something amiss.  After a while, I noticed that my hips were getting wider and my body looked ""boxy"".  It wasn't until I discovered Sleek Technique that I figured out why.  All those other workouts compartmentalized my muscles.  That is, I would just work on arms, then abs, then butt, etc.  And they focused on accessory muscles, which is good, but to exclude the large calorie burning muscles caused me to gain weight even though I was working out everyday.  But Sleek Technique is different.  Using real ballet moves and terminology, it incorporates your whole body into every exercise (accessory and major muscle groups).  By coordinating my entire musculature to work as a complete package, I immediately saw a difference.  Everything slimmed inwards and looked elongated at the same time.  I haven't tried streaming videos from their website yet, but after the results I've seen from just their DVDs, I think I might have to invest.
