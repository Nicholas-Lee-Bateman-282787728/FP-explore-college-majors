6936546,2,B00RYQ59OA,"Let me clarify my rating. A very powerful story about one mans struggle to save the perceived morals of his country, while up against a ruling party that has swept his nation and that only wants him to be silenced. That being said, the production was quite pitiful. Poor acting and dialog,  to the point that I almost turned it off early on.  Therefore, 2 stars only..",1471737600,5,368,4.477611940298507

6936548,5,B00RYQ59OA,"True story about a priest who had no fear to preach against Hitler and the Nazis no matter what consequences he would have to face. Great man, great hero!",1469750400,4,154,4.344827586206897

6936550,5,B00RYQ59OA,"Wow! What a guy. You want to see courage. This guy had courage. In the mist of ""good people"" doing ""bad things"" he cries out for morality and paid the price. The Pope in Rome at the time should be ashamed of his inaction in light of what priests such as Fr. Mayer did.",1468022400,5,268,3.9814814814814814

6936552,2,B00RYQ59OA,"The story is excellent.

However, the acting is very very very poor.",1465948800,2,68,4.666666666666667
6936553,4,B00RYQ59OA,Stacy Keach just wonderful as usual. Nicola Mayerl new comer was very interesting to watch. But I just love Daryl Hannah. She's so under rated as an actress. Very intense film. Should have got way more attention.,1461024000,2,212,4.756756756756757

8696339,2,B00RYQ59OA,"Pretty much unwatchable.  I stopped halfway through and went over to Wikpedia to get some idea of who the man actually was. He deserved better than this movie.

Win some, lose some.",1521417600,,181,4.625
8696340,1,B00RYQ59OA,"Fr. Rupert Mayer was a singularly brave man, possessing the rare courage to speak the truth in an atmosphere being suffocated evil. For this reason, the production quality of this film was especially disappointing. Acting too was uninspiring.
Far too much use of wordy, plodding dialogue.",1510617600,,288,5.282608695652174

8696343,1,B00RYQ59OA,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I just couldn't believe all the bad reviews and foolishly bought the movie.  I discovered after forcing myself to watch the entire movie that the bad reviews were truly not bad enough.  I have no words to describe how awful this movie is.,1487980800,2,280,4.56
8696344,5,B00RYQ59OA,This is a great and very intense film about WWII form the perspective of the Germans.,1486166400,2,85,4.375
8696345,1,B00RYQ59OA,"Purchased for German mother for Christmas. We decided to check the dvd for play. The format is too large, we've tried every option. Also, the dvd won't play on our brand new dvd player. I can't find an email address to contact the seller of the dvd... So disappointed. We are believers of PRM and avid donors/visitors to St. Michael's Church in Munich. I will gladly change my rating if Marc & Lukas will contact me.",1481846400,,416,4.4868421052631575
