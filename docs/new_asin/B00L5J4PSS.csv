8663822,5,B00L5J4PSS,"This is a splendid performance from Verona which has been the site of so many excellent televised productions. This has excellent high def video and sound. The main reason to see it of course is the terrific performance Ermonela Jaho who was a huge success at the Met this year in Butterfly and also a wonderful new recording of Leoncavallo's  Zaza, also available from Amazon, as well as another high def performance in Puccini's Trittico.",1523491200,,440,4.866666666666666

This is exactly the same performance. Very nice.and good sound quality.",1479859200,,167,5.0
8663824,1,B00L5J4PSS,"This production was recorded live at the Arena di Verona in 2011. I was not familiar with either of the two principles so I placed an order as soon as it was listed. I started writing notes once it became clear this was not going to be a happy time. The orchestra sound is clear during the prelude, but the sound gets cloudy as soon as the singing begins.
The stage is set on the Arena steps with basically no backdrop. It's made up of mostly picture frames and large posters on cloth scattered around. It's clear right away that no body mics are used, and the voices are distant, often swamped by the orchestra. Since there's no ceiling, back wall or sides, the voices get little reinforcement, but they are not big voices to start with. Maybe there is some audio reinforcement for the audience, but it doesn't seem to be fed into the recording equipment.
Violetta and Alfredo are in formal wear, but Alfredo's make-up makes him look like a Corpse - a greyish foundation with cheek rouge and red lipstick. That may work for an audience 200 feet away with stadium lighting, but certainly not for close-up video.
I came to the conclusion fairly early that this had to be a student production - Violetta and Alfredo knew their music but noy their characters. They sang past each other and the dancers that were there for the party hardly interacted and then left. I suspect that there were a number of cuts taken but I really don't want to go back and go over this trainwreck. So much of the human interaction that goes on in act one just sailed past.  Near the end of the act we notice Violetta sitting on one of these oversize picture frames with a web belt on and some nylon handholds and see the frame slowly rising as the lights go out. What a waste of affect and time!
Act two begins with oversized beach furniture and a large floral picture on cloth that is somewhat lifted up at the back. No country house, the picture is the garden I guess...  Germont Pere arrives, Vladimir Stoyanov made up as a Ghoul - white pancake with dark brown age lines, like Ghiaurov made up as Mefistofeles on the old Decca album. He has a good baritone voice, but without much subtlety or character, like the principles. Alfredo has his shirt open, so we see his tanned neck below the greyish foundation they have on him. Oy.
The conductor,  Julian Kovatchev, races thru the whole casino scene, rolling right thru some of th most significant moments in the opera, not stopping for ""Va, va..."". I was amazed! The scene with the Gypsies and Matadors was much shortened, choreography was poor, footwork was random, and the matadors couldn't manage to twirl their capes together.
The third Act was like trains passing in the night. But lest I forget, for the third Act Violetta, who was rather plainly made up so far, was now made up to look like a Zombie. Very sallow skin tone, sunken cheeks, showing her teeth like a mummy.  You could hardly make this stuff up, it's so ridiculous!
We have a corpse, a ghoul and a zombie. Did anybody even WATCH this before it was issued?

And if Arthaus has the resources available to publish this, why are we unable to get a video of Antonacci, Meli and Vassallo doing Traviata? And while we're at it, how about some Ewa Podles? Those are artists that NEED to be recorded.

On the bright side, I watched the 2007 Traviata from La Scala with Ghiorghiu, Vargas and Frontali on blu-ray, and it is superb! Ghiorghiu and Vargas are so expressive, so is Frontali. How refreshing! Everything that's missing at Verona is here. And, it's been on  special (complete, but with promo for other titles) for less than $10, but not forever. Grab it if you find it.
There's also a lesser-known Traviata I wanted to mention. It's part of the Tutto Verdi set on C major, extremely creatively done with
great visual images and singing. I'll review it separately.",1411603200,13,3862,4.532281205164993
