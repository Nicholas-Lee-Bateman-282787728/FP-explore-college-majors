Similar to ""An American  Family,"" the 1970's PBS documentary about the Loud family of Santa  Barbara, one almost feels like a voyeur peeking into the intimate details  of others' lives.  However, ""Ordinary People"" is fiction, though  one may forget that very easily -- it is that well-written and -acted.  This is a movie that is tense and gut-wrenching as the story slowly reveals  the emotional knots of a family in silent turmoil.  Perhaps the best scenes  in the film are between Conrad and Beth, who as mother and son fail to  connect on any level other than their unspoken anguish.",941068800,,690,4.913043478260869

Not only has my opinion of it remained unchanged, it has been strengthened: THIS IS THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!  It is perfect.  There is not a false moment, a wasted shot, or a badly chosen word.  It is  pointless to dwell on all the incredible aspects of this film, because  there are no bad ones.  (Although I have to say, Mary Tyler Moore's  performance is absolutely unforgetable.)  The truthfulness and humanity are  so achingly real they took my breath away -- again and again and again.  For anyone who enjoys stories about real (ordinary) people experiencing  real emotions, this one is not to be missed.  Oh, and you can't be afraid  to cry buckets, either, because it's unavoidable.  So grab a box of  tissues, and watch Ordinary People.",940809600,4,831,4.627586206896551
259099,5,6300216977,"Robert Redford's adaptation of Judith Guest's probing novel about a young man ""powerless and in the grips of circumstance"" (a quote from the movie) is a grand achievement in all of cinema. I was so moved to see  the exotic tapestry of performances by the legends of Hollywood so  masterfully served by a great actor and director in Redford. Hutton gives  his best performance and Mary Tyler Moore breaks the typecast of her Dick  Van Dyke image to haunt viewers for some time. Donald Sutherland, ever  introspective, probably lands the mark so superbly in an understated but  mystifying character of rich detail coming to the grips that his wife died  inside with the death of her eldest son. Judd Hirsch, the bohemian  psychiatrist, is dazzling with his one-liners hitting the core of the human  soul of Hutton to reveal a sublime confusion and guilt of living while  another dies in tragedy. The suicidal episode captured on film by Hutton  with Hirsch is heartstoppingly accurate. I really wonder if Redford had  ever entertained such a notion of mortality for filming such an exact  feeling. I am inclined to agree the film is a clinic in the art of  directing, acting, writing, and producing; you will never find a sounder  piece of work in film. Only the film ""The Crying Game"" has a  similar intensity of purpose though is a notch or two below Redford's  masterpiece. Quiz Show was brilliant too....but Ordinary People was  anything but Ordinary--it was Art!

259158,5,6300216977,"This film has gained a little notoriety over the years as the one that beat ""Raging Bull"" for Best Picture in 1980 which is undeniably a masterpiece.  Comparing the two is a little like apples and oranges.  Both are great in their own right but for different reasons.  I approached this film with a little trepidation.  I haven't seen this film since I was 18 years old and didn't know what to expect.  I don't share director Robert Redford's worldview but to dismiss the film on those grounds would be intellectually dishonest.  Redford won the Best Director Oscar over Martin Scorsese which caused a little controversy but even that's debatable.  ""Raging Bull"" is more of a triumph of artistry whereas ""Ordinary People"" is character and narrative driven.  What drew me to the film was that I was curious how it approached psychiatry.  As a layman I thought the film pretty much got it right with maybe a few questions about boundary and ethics issues.  For instance would Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch) have a session with Calvin (Donald Sutherland) without Conrad (Timothy Hutton) present? That may be quibbling because I don't know if this is a real conflict of interest when you're dealing with teens. I also found it interesting that you never see Dr. Berger write a scrip or Conrad taking meds.  This is important because there's a common misconception that medication is a cureall when in reality it only works in combination with intensive one-on-one therapy.  I was intrigued about Conrad being subject to electroshock while in the mental health facility because I assumed the practice was discredited and considered barbaric but maybe not at that time.  As for the performances all are uniformly excellent.  Sutherland perfectly encapsulates the inner turmoil of a father watching his family fall apart.  The pained expression on his face says pretty much everything.  Hutton won Best Supporting Actor in an essentially leading role if Robert De Niro hadn't been up that year.  Regardless, Hutton expertly captures the pain and anxiety of a mourning teen probably channeling his own grief from losing his own father, Jim Hutton, not long before making this film.  The key, though, in my mind is Mary Tyler Moore as Beth.  If Moore doesn't hit all the right notes this whole film falls apart.  There is not a wrong move or gesture by Moore as a woman who falls apart emotionally in the wake of tragedy.  In essence Beth is more crippled than Conrad is and unwilling or unable to confront it.  Subtlety and not histrionics is the main asset of Moore's performance.  Control is a mainstay of Beth's mental makeup which coincidentally Dr. Berger states he isn't a big fan of.  Just watch Moore's last scene of the film and it will just break your heart.  A note of irony is that Moore lost her own son to suicide around the time of the film's release.  Truly one of the great performances by an actress in recent years and deserving of recognition. A simplistic reading of the film's ending would say Calvin and Beth divorce while in fact they've only separated.  What happens to their marriage in the end is ambiguous so ultimately there's  room for hope.  The themes outlined in ""Ordinary People"" are universal and timeless.  I think it should be mandatory for teens in conjunction with Judith Guest's source novel as long as you have an adult explaining issues that may be out of their realm of world experience.  A difficult film to watch nonetheless essential viewing.  I guess in the end the message of this film pure and simply is that nobody's perfect.",1514678400,2,3561,4.815485996705107

Potential Spoiler:

What struck me as most relevant upon this viewing (I'd seen this run on cable TV once before about 12 years prior) was the concept of flexibility.  Conrad has two female companions and two parents.  In each set, one models the ability to adapt and change one's mind once gathering new information while the other by contrast prefers to remain rigid in their thinking.  At the end of the movie, Conrad grows closer to the girl and the parent that have this flexible approach while losing touch with the other girl and the other parent that cling to absolutes of perfection and should be's.",1511827200,3,1087,5.0055555555555555

As others have noted, this is one of those films so packed with meanings, it appeals to different people on different levels, and one can see new aspects with repeated viewings. It is a remarkable character study of three very different responses to tragedy by members of a family. The focus is on the son, Conrad (wonderful), but I especially wanted to mention the spectacular depiction of what good psychiatry CAN be (ditto in the movies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sybil/dp/B01M9IEKGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sybil</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B001954D80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>), and the moving, complex character of Beth, played by Mary Tyler Moore, heartbreaking. Brilliant, in every way, don't miss it!

***SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THIS UNTIL AFTER YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM, IT GIVES AWAY A-HAH MOMENTS THAT MAKE VIEWING A PROFOUND EXPERIENCE***
The many reviews here that speak to Beth's emptiness and coldness, miss the crux of her character and the family dynamic, at least what I see. Beth has lost her favorite son, yes, and THEN, her other son attempts suicide. She CANNOT forgive him for that, cannot trust him, one terrible tragedy after another- how could he do this to her? And now, another crisis looms. She's done had enough, shuts down. Why does she dump the french toast in the sink? She's struggling to contain her hurt and rage, TOO MUCH. She nearly implodes several times, an emotional wreck just beneath the carefully composed surface. She can't even tolerate a HUG, for fear of breaking down, losing control. She must keep a tight lid on at all times. It's not that she doesn't feel anything, it's that she's afraid of feeling too much. And the last thing she feels is affectionate, or forgiving.

She keeps Conrad at arm's length not because she hates him, but because he threatens her sanity, her equilibrium. She loves him (though doesn't ADORE him, like she did her first-born), but she just can't TAKE any more. Even so, she reaches out to him at several points (look at the scene out in the yard), and it's Conrad who throws a wrench in the works. They're often at cross purposes (in the next scene, he's sorry, but now she blows HIM off). Back and forth. And a behavioral therapist might point out how very effectively Conrad drives a wedge between his parents, another thing Beth defensively reacts to, grows even more angry and off-kilter about. And ultimately- Dad sides with Conrad. A good family therapist could've sorted this all out (indeed, this is a favorite film to show grad students in family therapy, and other psychotherapeutic approaches).

Later she is furious at catching Conrad in a new pack of lies, the pattern seems to be starting all over again. Her previous wounds still fresh, she just wants to flee, escape. She wants to maintain the status quo. She feels her husband slipping away from her, putting her further off-kilter. Many people react this way to loss and pain, horror over not having control over circumstance, for one thing. The hallmark of her personality is the need for control, order, her way of staving off fears (she's afraid of everything from barking dogs to pigeons to swimming pools). She exhibits traits suggestive of OCD, or Asperger's Syndrome- everything must be just so, and proceed according to plan, or anxiety threatens to overwhelm, be her very undoing: ""She fired the [bleeping] maid for not dusting properly, you think she's going to forgive ME for trying to OFF myself!?"" Whatever the cause, such people, many people, when confronted with tragedy, often withdraw, kick into auto-pilot, like robots (the remark about the color of Calvin's shoes), a self-protective mechanism. Common, crippling.

I saw several reviews labeling Beth a narcissist, I disagree. Narcissists crave attention, don't want to deflect it. Were she a narcissist she would've thriven on ""Poor Beth, how brave you are, with all you've had to deal with!"" Narcissists are pathological about the limelight, drawing attention to themselves, and Beth sought to do the exact opposite, business as usual, denial of difficulties (a narcissist would've exploited them). A narcissist would never be devastated by a simple hug or a family photo. Yes, she was concerned about outward appearances but that does not a narcissist make- she was more a control freak, in an attempt to keep a frightening world at bay, and HORRIFIED at feelings that threatened to overwhelm her- withdrawing, like a turtle into it's shell. Just look at the ending, as she packs her bags and... it all comes apart. Tragic. With a good therapist, like Berger, she could've faced her fears and feelings and emerged whole.

Others' reaction might be to give more, love more, NEED more, as does her husband Calvin. He, unlike his wife, hungers for increased intimacy. In any case, the disparity between their two styles is just too much to be overcome, sadly. And brilliantly, it's shown, that despite Berger's counsel to extend compassion and forgiveness to Beth, through the insidious effects of ""hindsight bias"" all her past behavior, previously thought charming, appropriate, even endearing (!), is reevaluated in light of her present emotional difficulties and found to be wanting. ""We would've been all right if there just hadn't been any MESS,"" sighs Calvin. Tragic indeed.

Some reviewers mentioned that Beth was sorry Conrad survived, blamed him for surviving, since her beloved Buck did not. I think not, in fact, the pivotal key to Conrad's turning the therapeutic corner, with Dr. Berger's help, was in realizing that the regret, sorrow, crippling guilt at having survived while his beloved brother did not was his OWN, not his mother's. These are complex, thorny issues, also having to do with extremes of thought, black and white thinking- just because Conrad was not his mother's favorite does NOT mean she wished HIM dead instead (this is a very common generalization amongst surviving siblings).

And regarding black and white thinking, in non-clinicians and movie viewers alike- one person needn't be at fault, to blame (and anyway, what did Beth say or do that was so wrong?). It wasn't her fault OR Conrad's. It was nobody's fault (stated TWICE in the film, for emphasis, once by Berger and once by Calvin), or everybody's fault, they all made mistakes, very complicated. Just imagine how differently things might have gone had Calvin sided with his wife instead of his son, it could've just as easily gone that way. And with such a vote of confidence, and moral support, Beth might've been buoyed enough to relax, let down her defenses and might then have felt more empathy for Conrad. Just because Conrad complained his mother hated him, didn't make it so- indeed, Berger thought it unlikely and counseled accordingly, his father dismissed the possibility outright at first, and Beth herself was wounded at the charge- ""Mothers don't hate their sons! See how you believe everything HE says, and you don't believe me?"" But the accusation made Calvin begin to reappraise his wife in a harsh, new light- and that was the beginning of the end for their family, and for poor Beth.

As it played out, what Beth WAS guilty of was refusing to go in for family counseling, as Dr. Berger, and her husband wanted. Family therapy is incredibly powerful, and could've helped them heal both severally and as a family.

Another movie that explores the theme of incompatible parental responses to a child's death (but with a happier outcome for the Beth-like character, played by William Hurt) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accidental-Tourist/dp/B001N3FDX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accidental Tourist</a>, another favorite film (and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/B0012E3J60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>). I'd rather hoped for a sequel to Ordinary People with a similar ending, down the line.  But Ordinary People is a WONDERFUL movie, memorable and profound, thanks to the story, the wondrous performances (by all, including Judd Hirsch's as Dr. Berger, just astonishing) and Robert Redford's inspired direction.  HIGHEST recommendation.

Leave it, I'll mend it""), distracting herself with familiar social niceties, and trying to distance herself from Conrad in ways both subtle and not). We're afforded equally incisive glimpses into Conrad's and Calvin's hearts and minds. Phenomenal.

And one funny/touching line has entered our family lexicon, surprising how often it comes in handy (spoken by Dr. Berger to Calvin): ""That sounds more like the philosophy of a DRIFTER than a tax attorney!"" Ordinary People is a treasure.",1511222400,4,9628,5.488529014844804

259295,4,6300216977,"Review of Ordinary People
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

In 1980, Robert Redford proved to Hollywood he was more than just a pretty face by directing Ordinary People and winning the Best Director Oscar the following year. Really, though, did anyone think he was just a pretty face? By the time Ordinary People hit the theaters in September 1980, hed starred in Neil Simons most successful Broadway play, been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer, been nominated for an Emmy, won three Henrietta World Film Favorite Awards, won a BAFTA award for Best Actor, won a Western Heritage Award, been nominated for four Golden Laurels, and created a little contribution to independent cinema called the Sundance Film Festival.

In Ordinary People, Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are grieving over the death of their favored son. Timothy Hutton, the other son, has spent four months in a mental hospital after an attempted suicide. Hes far from well-adjusted when he returns to his dysfunctional family environment, and the film follows everyones grieving process and how they adjust to their new normal. This is a very tense family drama, and a groundbreaking film at the time.

Moore showed an incredible new side to her acting talents, since this role was so different from her television roles on The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Ive actually never seen her television work, so its hard for me to imagine her as anything but a serious dramatic actress. If that sounds silly to you, watch this movie and youll understand. Moore was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars in 1981, and Hutton, who was only twenty years old, was and is the youngest actor to win Best Supporting Actor. I always say its incredible to find child actors who are able to give a good, reliable performance, but its equally incredible to see young adults who are terrific actors. Young children are used to taking orders from grown-ups, but young adults are at the age where they're starting to rebel from authority figures. Theyre just starting to discover who they are, and attempting to lose themselves in an acting role could feel confusing and unsafe. At the delicate age of twenty, Timothy Hutton gives a deep feeling, unforgettable performance.",1506297600,,2299,4.904884318766067

This time I see so many wonderful points in this movie, I barely know where to start.  It is an almost perfect movie.  The cast is excellent - no, exquisite.  All of them, including the swim coach and the boys on the swim team.  Dinah Manoff - my gawd, what a sterling performance.  Only a few minutes on screen, but she conveyed Karen's desperation with her eyes and body language.  It was obvious she wasn't going to make it.  She definitely got her mother's acting genes (Lee Grant).  When I first saw this movie, I remember thinking Beth was brittle and heartless but this time around, I got that MTM lets us see that this woman's grief and pain is absolutely smothering her.  Redford is meticulous in all the details, even the scrapes on Timothy Hutton's hands when he is hugging Judd Hirsch, the scrapes he had gotten shortly before he had a fist fight with the big mouth on the swim team.  Dialogue was real.  Ordinary People is in my Top Five movies.  Kudos to every member of the cast and all who were involved in making this film!",1491264000,2,1218,4.427927927927928

I was very heavily moved by that movie when I watched it back in the early 1980s.  It sure reflected on what I was walking through during my teenaged years.  I also received help from a renown Psychiatrist  - his office was not too far away from where the movie was shot - through that time, and that similar experience is also fabulously portrayed in the story.

Saying this film is a drama is an understatement - it is a bombshell that exposes the internal climate in a family that has all the material things, but lacks a uniform bond of love.  This becomes very visible when they are faced with loss. Tragedy strikes,s blame gets pulled out as their shield.  Unspoken blame also ran rampart in this family.

Mary's performance was stunning, spot-on - she was perfectly cast for this role.  Judd Hirsch as the psychiatrist showed alot of depth in caring for his patient.  I love Donald Sutherland's acting and he was a great casting choice for role of a husband and father dealing with hurt and loss in multiple forms.

I read that Robert Redford, the director, had Mary Tyler Moore & Donald Sutherland not talk with Timothy Hutton, the son in the movie, during the filming. Redford said he wanted young Hutton to feel isolated so it would show in his acting~~~& it did. He got an Academy Award for his role, the youngest person to ever get supporting actor award. This is such a true tale of ""ordinary families"" in our world today. We all know families like this with cold, distant mothers who are so prim & proper & are all about the ""looks"" of things. They hurt their children, as is portrayed in this poignant movie.  It is not a feel good movie for sure but it is so well done & Sutherland is a magnificent actor.

The feedback from clinic staff has always been positive. I am a very big fan of this wonderful film and each actor was deserving of the nominations they received for their thoughtful and deeply moving work on this film. As a huge Mary Tyler Moore (R.I.P., Mare) fan her work was simply a joy to watch. I don't say this often but it was one of those rare moments where I felt she was truly robbed of the Oscar in 1980. At least the film won Best Picture as did Robert Redford for Directing this truly fantastic film and Timothy Hutton in the role of a lifetime (I don't think he's ever come close to matching this performance in his career).

259704,5,6300216977,"When this film was released in 1980, I was 19 and I was a projectionist at a theater in Mobile, Alabama. Back in that time, the movies were delivered in individual reels (6 to 8 depending on running length) and it was the projectionist's job to splice the reels together for the film to be loaded onto the projector. That was an exciting time for me because I had the pleasure of being able to screen the film, that I had just pieced together, alone, in a vast empty auditorium with my large buttered popcorn, Reese's Pieces, and 32oz Coke. I was lucky enough to be the first in Mobile to see many films of that decade. Some, became iconic classics, i.e. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Superman 2, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan, The Big Chill. Others became guilty pleasures, Porky's, Hell Night, and the very fun 9 to 5. But, I am compelled to tell you that nothing, and I mean nothing, touched me as much as Mary Tyler Moore becoming Beth Jarrett before my eyes on that huge, larger than life projection screen in front of me.

259812,5,6300216977,"I'm sure others have already given this amazing movie all the praise it deserves, but I'll add my two cents. Powerfully acted by every single actor and actress...gripping plot and gut wrenching emotion. Judd Hirsch was phenomenal as the psychiatrist and his technique very advanced for 1980 mental health, in my opinion. I absolutely loved Elizabeth McGovern's character, who is outspoken, intelligent, empathic, and straight forward. Timothy Hutton, in my opinion, deserved an Oscar for his performance and Donald Sutherland was brilliant, as well.

I loathed Mary Tyler Moore's character (although she was incredibly acted), which is not my usual reaction to a grieving mother...and it surprised me. As did the way the script treated her. Very seldom do you see someone called on their bad behavior and let go rather than forcing them into a fairy tale happy ending. I thought the ending was absolutely perfect.

The therapy scenes alone are worth a viewing, let alone all of the other wonderful components of this beautiful movie. If you like emotional drama and don't mind weeping, please do give this movie a try. :)",1467676800,,1121,5.086956521739131

After watching the trailer, I was not incredibly excited to have this on the list- I mean, it's old, and it just seemed like it was going to be about a family dealing with depression- A very important and delicate topic, but not exactly the most entertaining thing I would want on my TV. The movie is actually quite good, even after all this time. The acting and writing are very good. The portrayal of psych illness is also good. Importantly to me, this movie really explored some of the stigmas and social aspects of depression and psychiatric illness that we tend to not want to talk about or acknowledge. The therapy was well done. Overall, this is one of those movies that actually portrays mental illness well, potentially decreasing public stigma, and also left a good impression of psychiatry- something else movies often do NOT do.

259947,5,6300216977,"Except for the fact that there is no other sibling in my family and thus no fraternal guilt, turn off the volume and you have a moving picture of my family in 1980. I was a senior in college when this was released and I went to the theater to see this with friends. I don't remember how far into the film I got before having to run to the men's room to vomit but it was after a good hour passed. Somehow, Moore had become my stepmother, down to her hairstyle, clothing, facial expressions, etc. Sutherland was my dad, the referee between us who contemplated divorce. And I was Hutton, so in need of some kind of maternal interest, if not affection.

That was my family. Upper-middle-class with the expectation that the son would continue in the UMC, marry into the UMC, produce progeny who would continue the tradition, etc. The house and furniture, tee time at the club, my life on the screen. It was more than uncomfortable the second attempt in the 1990's and I didn't make it as far as I had at the theater.

Finally I read the book last week and then today I watched the film. From beginning to end. There's no way that I could approach the film other than as a might-have-been story of my family, so I didn't try. There was no way to watch the conflicts, the dialog, the frozen emotionless faces as well as the caring and loving faces, the confused faces, and not recognize the tortured face of my father in the middle.

I almost think that I should be morally denied the right to review this movie on the grounds that it is my biography. But, putting that aside, I cannot understand

I didn't want to sully my review by reading other's first but I did catch one or two that mentioned that everyone's reaction to this film would be completely different and individual. All I can say is that the entire cast excelled in representing a snippet of an emotionally charged and painful part o.  U, .  N nnnn.  f my life.

259950,5,6300216977,"This movie, so different from Redford's plodding subsequent efforts, was made from a novel actually sold to a publisher without the intermediary of a literary agent. The shock that went through New York publishing was so great that they threw an enormous party for the author.

The essence of the movie is that Conrad's mother can't forgive him for four things:

(1) Not being wanted (blurted out by the father in the psychiatrist's office)
(2) Quitting the swim team, which was Conrad's bona fides as an ostensibly recovered mental patient
(3) Seeing a psychiatrist, which embarrasses the status-conscious mother in her suburban community
(4) Having survived the brother she loved more, who drowned in the sailboat accident that Conrad lived through.

Many viewers think the movie blames everything on the mother.

Yes, the movie blames everything on the mother. Without her rigidity and coldness, the family could have survived Buck's drowning without falling apart.",1455408000,,968,5.266233766233766

This is such a compelling, and sad story. The acting, from everyone, is nothing short of amazing, and makes Ordinary People the extraordinary film that it is. For any family that has lost a child, of any age, this can be hard to watch at times, but it gives a very honest and real portrayal of how differently people handle such a loss. Even when  watching this film so many years later, the emotions that it elicits are often as palpable, and even jarring, as they were the first time. The fact that the Academy overlooked Donald Sutherland for an Oscar nomination is almost criminal, and is beyond explanation. All the lead and supporting performances are just fantastic.

There are my baseball movies that I watch each spring, and various holiday movies, e.g. Christmas Vacation. Next, there are movies like ""Ordinary People"" that are so well crafted that one is forever discovering something new. Finally there are movies like ""And the Band Played On"" that are of such historical significance that watching from time to time is a good refresher course.

260058,5,6300216977,"Ordinary People is one of my favorite movies of all time. Robert Redford made his directorial debut in this hauntingly emotional tale of a family coming apart at the seams in the aftermath of unspeakable tragedy. As the cold-aloof upper class mother, Mary Tyler Moore gives the performance of her career. The fact that she didn't win the Oscar for Best-Actress that year will always be one of the Academy's biggest mistakes. Timothy Hutton (who did win the Oscar) is just incredible as the stories central figure. Donald Sutherland is the almost meek, caring father who is trying to make sense of it all and Judd Hirsh adds brevity to his role as the doctor who helps the troubled youth come to terms with his pain. I was riveted when I first saw this film. Like many people I saw parallels to my own life which drew me back to the film again and again--and again. Each viewing is equally as moving and I am reminded anew just how perfect it is on every level.

260103,5,6300216977,"I saw this when it was initially released back in 1980 at a little ""last-run"" theater. It was a chilly winter's evening and vividly recall walking home in a stunned state of mind. At sixteen these were  some pretty heavy topics to absorb but I am glad that I had access to these mature films and overall had a beneficial effect on me during this period of my life. Sadly, I doubt many teenagers of a similar age would have the patience to sit through this drama and let themselves become involved in the story. There are several emotional punches to the gut but I cannot call Ordinary People a depressing film--sad, yes, but not depressing. There is hope amidst the terrible events that befall these three main characters. None of them are perfect as their social status may imply. Beneath the veneer of the beautiful home, manicured lawn, and comfortable lifestyle are some pretty broken people. Of all the characters it is (in my own perspective) is Donald Sutherland who is the mediator between the two drifting halves of his family until he reaches a moment of harsh insight which one of those emotional punches. It comes on so quietly and without melodramatic pomp. Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton are superb with an equally terrific supporting cast. I cannot recommend this film highly enough and deserves all the acclaim it got. The mark of a good film is when it becomes virtually an out-of-body experience when you are so drawn and invested in the characters and situations on the screen that you lose a momentary sense of your own existence. It is a wonderful feeling when it happens---but sadly all too rarely nowadays. The 80's was a harbinger of things to come with overblown Hollywood blockbusters but amongst the flash and noise were a few gems---Ordinary People is certainly among them.",1445299200,,1806,4.7699680511182105

260138,5,6300216977,"And I'm also tired of all of the critics that knock this movie because it won the Academy Award for best picture instead of Raging Bull. For Pete's sake, Martin Scorsese himself has praised Ordinary People for being a ""deeply moving film.""

There's a lot to recommend this movie. Much-praised Hollywood veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent did a great job streamlining an overwritten and not too well-edited novel (a novel that is nevertheless a pretty good read). Sargent won the Academy Award for his screenplay.

Timothy Hutton, who won the best supporting actor Academy Award for his work on this film, turned in what turned out to be one of the best performances of the 1980's.

And Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore and Judd Hirsch were all cast against type and turned out to be worth the risk by turning in solid, creative performances. Hirsch and MTM were rewarded with Academy Award acting nominations (Sutherland was unjustifiably denied a nomination).

And Robert Redford, who won the Oscar for best director in his first directorial outing with this picture, says that the previous film he had been acting in ran long, so he had to dive into Ordinary People with very little preparation and just direct by instinct. As far as I'm concerned, the film came across as if he had put a couple of years of preproduction into it. Terrific work for a first movie or a tenth movie.

Finally, there is Pauline Kael's infamous, mindless, mean-spirited review of this film. The only thing she could find that she liked about it was Meg Mundy's hair style (Mundy played the grandmother). The truth to the matter is that Kael was a nut and a much-of-the-time overrated film critic. (Oh, and by the way, she didn't think much of Raging Bull, believe it or not.)

Ordinary People is definitely worth a look.",1441584000,3,1807,4.794212218649518

260172,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" unnerved me when I first saw it in theaters many years ago, and has the same effect on me today.  This is a powerful, emotional story of a narcissistic mother who clearly loves the older of her two sons.  That her younger son is struggling to come to terms with why he survived a boating accident while his brother did not feeds her anger and disrupts her need to present her family in the best light.

This movie deserved every award it got and more.  This was a Mary Tyler Moore performance heretofore unseen or imagined.  Timothy Hutton's career as an actor was entirely established by this movie.  Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch are at their best.

The movie is exhausting to watch, but worth every minute.  Like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", I can only bring myself to watch ""Ordinary People"" every few years.  After all these years, I still end up open-mouthed and overwhelmed as the film closes, both because of the subject matters broached and because of the powerful acting.

260241,5,6300216977,"I've watched this f take a little something more from it every time.  The Principal actors are so nuanced they are truly perfection.

The Jarrett Family seems to be perfect from the outside despite the a family tragedy but the reality is they are a powder keg waiting to blow.  Eldest son Buck was killed in a boating accident which younger son Conrad survived.  Conrad subsequent suicide attempt led to a long hospital stay.  Now home, he's barely holding it together and all the cracks in his relationship with his mother Beth are springing leaps.  His father Calvin helplessly watches as his two surviving family members make attempts to connect but are doomed to fail.

I love Conrad.  I want to be his mother and give him all the love his own mother seems incapable of giving him.  I want to wrap him up in my arms and tell him his life has meaning and value and that it isn't his fault his brother died.  Watching his recovery is a beautifully painful.

Calvin is another heartbreaking character.  This man has all the love and best intentions in the world, but he can't bring his wife and surviving son together and it's killing him.

Beth is the most complex character.  It's easy to write her off as a bitch, but there is so much more to her.  Obviously Buck was her favorite child but she loves Conrad as well.  Buck's death threw a wrench in her perfect world and Conrad's suicide attempt as well has caused her to walk on eggshells with in her own home.  She's unable to give Conrad the love and comfort he needs.  But Beth needs comfort too.  She's just convinced herself she has to put on a shield and protect her sensibilities.  I have no doubt Beth is devastated by the loss of her family.  My heart breaks for her as well as Conrad as they each make awkward attempts to reach out to one another with dismal results.  I feel there is so much more to Beth, I would love to know what has caused her to become so lost in the illusion of her perfect family.

In the end, the story is true to it's natural conclusion but I still wish somehow this family can come together and heal the hurts of their past but the outcome of that is pretty ambiguous.  It doesn't matter, this film touches my heart as if I know the family intimately myself.",1433289600,,2250,4.379227053140097

260247,5,6300216977,"The opening shots are the peaceful but misty waters of Lake Michigan. Why is the lake the first shot? Eventually the scenes change to the sleepy suburban area off the coast of Lake Michigan in Lake Forest, Illinois. The town is very reminiscent of small communities in New England, with the beautiful golden leaves of Fall layering the roads and the gardens. Finally the camera rests upon a high school choir singing a transcribed rendition of Pachabel's Canon. The camera pans the many high school students contributing their sound to the musical collective. This will be a story about a certain high school student among these singers. Finally the camera rests on Conrad Jarrett played by Timothy Hutton. He is an ordinary person of high school age, or is he? In the next shot, he is jumping from sleep in a cold sweat as if from a nightmare. Something is amiss...

Next we meet his parents, Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore in not only the role of her career but a tour De force Oscar-caliber performance, and her husband, Calvin Jarrett, played by Donald Sutherland in probably his finest performance. At first they seem to be a contented happy middle-aged couple on the upper-crust of society. They go on many vacations during the holidays, they have the finest clothes, they go to expensive restaurants and plays, and they hop-nob with the social elite of the community. Calvin is a tax attorney making very good money, enough to afford his stay-at-home wife who keeps their house neat and orderly akin to Martha Stewart. When she's not placing expensive napkins on the dinner table, she is either shopping or playing golf. All seems well. Or is it?

Their only son, Conrad, is having trouble sleeping and eating. He's aloof with his friends at school, sometimes not looking at them when they are talking to him. And his mother acts, well, strangely toward him--not quite a healthy and nurturing mother-son relationship. As the story gradually unfolds we gather pieces about this family and find that not everything is as it seems. One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is its pacing. Pieces of back-story are brought gradually to the forefront. Each piece of the larger mosaic, one that is much greater than the time-frame of the actual story, comes to light only with great effort. There is a sense that the characters are purposefully engaged in hiding the larger back-story away like skeletons in the closet. When Conrad undertakes to see the psychiatrist Dr Berger, he claims that family, school, aka everything is ""fine"" to which Berger replies ""Then why are you here?"" The two things we begin to gradually understand is that Conrad was not the only son but he had an older brother now deceased. We also learn that Conrad had been in the hospital because of an attempted suicide. But these raise more questions than they answer. For one thing, with all this back story, why does the story take place at this time and place? Why did Conrad attempt suicide? How did his brother die? The answers lie somewhere within the waters of Lake Michigan...

This story may not only be about what happens to its characters, and the crises they ultimately must face. On one level, the story is a commentary on the false perception of ""ordinary"" or ""normal"" people. Particularly in America, we often have a false perception of the ""norm"". People raise families, bare children, see them off to college, etc, etc. With these larger generalities we often miss the struggles, the disappointments, the trauma, and even the tragedy that many experience, but often regarded as not happening to ""normal"" or ""ordinary"" people. Ironically, the character of Beth wants to give off the false but ""nice"" veneer of normalcy. At one point, she rages at Calvin for revealing at a social event that their son has started to see a psychiatrist. Beth sees friends at shopping malls and at parties, but she could not bare to have any of her fellow socialites know about any of the things that are really going on. And even when she is confronted by her husband to deal with their issues, she wants to go on vacation rather than the face the realities around her.

In many ways, ""Ordinary People"" is about secrets. The upper-crust of American society has a tendency to keep things shut within large 2-story houses with manicured lawns in front. Many have felt that if they revealed their dark secrets they would be judged as being ""abnormal"" by their peers. In many ways, the tragic message is that many others have these same problems and secrets, but they do not understand that revealing them to others could help the healing process. Ordinary people are not ordinary people, in other words, but we do not yet know this. A philosophical book once said, ""There are no such things as ordinary moments.""",1430870400,2,4796,4.788647342995169

It does not help that his mother who does not know how to show her emotions towards her son, and the only way of dealing with the loss of her son is to disengage from her younger son.

260307,4,6300216977,"Intellectually honest film is an emotionally brutalizing but powerfully acted narrative involving a young man's trials and tribulations at coming to grips with his earlier attempted suicide, and the loss of his brother--which he blames upon himself. The tragic loss is also something that his disaffected mother and non-confrontational father are finding difficult to deal with as well, to the point that the remaining family's wires of psychological connectivity are shown to be ever more fragile the more that time moves on without them.
Director Robert Redford wrings nearly every ounce of power out of his strong supporting cast, including the appropriately flat Judd Hirsch and the astonishingly revealing Mary Tyler Moore (whose performance is a noteworthy example of how restraint can take a player into previously unexplored psychological territory). ""Ordinary People"" is a slow-moving picture that will not appeal to everyone, but it is very gripping and unusually sad once one takes the time to get invested in its characters. In age when video game movies seem to be replacing stories with real human characters and valuable humanistic insights--not to mention devaluing human life with these endless parades of onscreen violence--""Ordinary People"" is a reminder that the common people in life have more to say about its urgency and meaning than those who are ""above"" the psychological stress that so easily fractures others. And in this way, ""Ordinary People"" is an essential film to watch and to learn from (especially for aspiring filmmakers, who need to understand that sensation is not the only path to travel). Although the film was deliriously over-praised upon its release--due in no small part to its Oscar sweep and unending media attention--""Ordinary People"" survives thanks to the heartfelt performances and a story that becomes more engrossing and tragic as it progresses.
Tragically, the Paramount DVD includes no extras to speak of (actually, an audio commentary by Judith Guest would have been welcomed, and why no retrospective?). Guest has been interviewed many times about the book and film, but there are no archival portraits offered here. The picture is fairly good on a widescreen TV, and the image is sharper on smaller screens. The sound is not spectacular, but it is passable for a film that has not yet received a decent treatment on home media as of yet (although Pachelbel's Cannon still sounds lovely).

260383,4,6300216977,"Most people who watch ""Ordinary People"" today, 35 years on, surely do so because they're Oscar completists. For a lot of people making their way through the list, it's probably one of the last Best Picture winners they make themselves sit down and watch. It's acquired an unfortunate reputation as being one of the Academy's notable ""mistakes,"" since it beat the more stylistically-challenging ""Raging Bull."" The reason that's unfortunate is that it's unfair to the movie, which taken on its own terms is a perceptive examination of a family's grief.

In honoring ""Ordinary People"" with the Best Picture and Best Director statues, Hollywood awarded for the first time one of its most genial figures, Robert Redford. As his directorial debut this is, appropriate enough, a genial movie. But it is difficult to explain why it is a good movie without explaining why it is not a great movie. It is a serious film that deals with death and suicide and broken homes, but it must be acknowledged even by the sympathetic reviewer that its handling of these issues is not much more serious or creative than a ""Very Special Episode"" of some '80s or '90s TV drama. It focuses squarely, all too squarely, on the ""humanity"" of its characters, and it hand-holds the audience through the plot all too gently. It feels, if not preachy, then like a therapy session that we've been assigned to attend because we have not been sufficiently attentive to the pain within ourselves and others. The always-on, always-sensitive tone of this kind of storytelling can be exhausting because it lacks the temporary relief that a little cynicism and distance can provide. The movie demands that you care for all of its characters all the time. This is a tough ask under the best of conditions, but especially when the characters hew too close to stock stereotypes. The high school students all fall pretty neatly into the standard categories of brainless jocks and quirky loners, and the parents are the overly-busy, clueless, grown-apart kinds we've seen before. At the beginning, Redford's directorial style, with its straight-on symmetrical shots of a dining room table and a camera that looks back and forth at people having a conversation like a crowd looks at a tennis match, seems equally unoriginal, but this decision actually pays off toward the end when the same pace and simplicity are used in cross-cutting a flashback sequence. The person having the flashback is really having a long-delayed, straightforward dialogue with himself, and the visual style suits this culmination well. Yet it is, after all, much the same as other revelatory and epiphany-making flashbacks in film and TV.

The ordinariness of ""Ordinary People"" is probably held against it more than it would be had it not won its Oscars, but at the same time far fewer people would probably watch it today had it not won them. And that would be a shame, because despite its shortcomings, it is an occasionally very perceptive film. For all the times it is too ""on the nose"" with a song choice (""Hallelujah"" when a character is happy) or a line of dialogue (how many times has ""I miss him too, you know!"" been declaimed on screen?), there are also moments of real observational insight, as when an introverted character presses the ""close door"" button on an elevator rather than risk a social encounter. That rings true, and thankfully it happens without being directly commented upon. The movie also casts Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore against type, which is interesting to see. To watch ""Ordinary People"" is to be reminded that Redford is, by all appearances, a refreshingly warmhearted and compassionate celebrity in an industry that too often rewards egoists and borderline sociopaths. I may be in a minority, but I frankly think it's nice that movies like this can and do win Best Picture over movies that are superior in technique but colder and bleaker in outlook.",1423180800,4,3926,4.946969696969697

260402,5,6300216977,"Wonderful movie about honesty and communication with ""ordinary people"".

I recommend you give it a try once or twice. People don't like to think and feel too deeply about the truth of life very often. Depending on your mood and personal life experiences you may, or may not like this movie.

As with ordinary life, the movie is more slow paced (not action-packed, rockstarish and easy) and gives you plenty of time to personally reflect on your feelings of each character in each situation. Granted the majority of the story is told from the Conrad's point of view, we still feel for each of the characters, whether it be the father, mother, son, friend, psychiatrist, etc.

People come up with personal reasons for not communicating with others, in an open and honest manner. They are ""afraid"" of something about themselves or ""afraid"" of the unknown or feared reaction of others if they were to be open and honest. That mentality and poor communication is what holds each and every one of us back from really connecting and living more meaningful and fulfilling lives.

Even with understanding how we could communicate better, it is still hard and is a life-long learning process. If EACH individual is willing to both talk and listen to one another and try to understand how the other thinks and communicates, then progress can be made, if we would only forgive ourselves and others and put aside our pride.

Good quotes from the psychiatrist and Conrad,
psychiatrist: ""It hurts to be mad at him."" ""Bad things happen even when people are careful"" ""people make mistakes"" ""Did it ever occur to you that you might have been stronger?"" at the time. ""How long are you going to punish yourself? When are you going to quit?""
Conrad: ""G.., I'd like to quit.""
psychiatrist: ""...I'm your friend.""
Conrad: ""I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been here.""

Conrad/girl: ""I just didn't know whether or not you were being straight with me.""
One of the hardest things I find is the way things others ""hear"" us say, and mannerisms we show, which come across differently than we intend.

Throughout the movie each friend/family member was trying to be there (except the mother, selfish, not willing) but one person was willing to see it. If they had problems might have been lightened more quickly.

A related quote about life I like,
Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that hes been robbed. The fact is that most putts don't drop, most beef is tough, most children grow up to just be people, most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration, most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. Life is like an old time rail journeydelayssidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas and thrilling burst of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.

260482,5,6300216977,"Robert Redford was at the end of his pretty boy period.  He had been a popular actor for about ten years before he decided to direct his first film, and he replaced his face with a brilliant film that shows he had been paying attention to all the directors he worked with, and ignored them, righty.  This is very much an actor's film; the house and environs are the haut-Bourgieous suburbs of Chicago, and act as an ironic background to the real pain that makes this film so powerful.  Even if most people don't know Mary Tyler Moore anymore, this film is her masterpiece performance, and one of the strongest by any actor I've ever seen.  Most actors in Hollywood could never conceive of banking their careers playing a hateful character as does MTM here.  Her portrait of an aggrieved mother out of love with her life going through the motions is horrifying.  Donald Sutherland's quiet father is the center of this film; he appears confused at the inequities of life, but understands, perhaps naively, that love means everything.  As Conrad, the brutalized, abandoned son, Timothy Hutton inhabits a skin crawling with guilt, self-hate, and rage with courage and commitment.  Alas, he never rose to this height again. Judd Hirsch's weirdly-named Psychiatrist Trevor Berger, is a weak point for me, but Hirsch carries off this thankless role of the default emotive Jewish character in this icy wilderness of WASPS.  Of course, Elizabeth McGovern is excellent as a young woman who responds to Conrad's pain with awkwardness, and watch for Animal Mother, Adam Baldwin as one of Conrad's friends.  This film opened up Chicagoland as a sort of middle-class playground, and John Hughes's many films took place here, as well as the film Risky Business, though these are comedies, and this film is that great rarity, an American tragedy.",1419292800,,1830,4.912337662337662

260596,5,6300216977,"Although the subject matter is sad the acting is excellent.  I've read the book (not as good as the movie in my opinion) and have seen this movie at least 10 times.  Donald Sutherland is one of my favorite actors (every time Klute is on TCM I'm watching it) and well I grew up watching Mary Tyler Moore (she should have done a lot more meatier roles because she's so talented) but Timothy Hutton stole this movie.  His performance is hypnotic.  I don't feel as though I'm watching a move, but instead am right there in that household and in their lives.  Timothy absolutely deserved to win the Oscar as well as Robert Redford for director.

I also have to mention Judd Hirsch (love him too especially since my family and I watched Taxi every week until the show was canceled).  He was up for the Oscar too against Timothy Hutton.  It's a shame he didn't win an Oscar too because he was fantastic; the part close to the end when Conrad has his breakthrough (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it).  I'm literally holding my breath watching that scene.

There are very few films that stay with me  but this movie always does.  The more times I watch it I have a better understanding of MTM character.  When I first saw it I thought ""what a bitch"" but I don't feel that way anymore.  Of course, when this movie came out I was 18 but having just watched it again at age 52 I see and feel things differently.

But in order to keep the outward appearance of perfection, she had to give birth to Conrad, make love to her husband at prescribed intervals, and live the life of a upper middle class housewife.
Buck's letting go of the sailboat was symbolic of removing himself from the smothering demands of this Oedipal relationship, even if it meant dying. He was emotionally drowning and the only way he could escape was to physically drown.
Conrad slitting his wrists forced the blinders from his father. Cleaning the blood and messy towels exposed his wife's excessive need for perfection as a facade for hiding her superficial feelings for him and Conrad.",1412380800,,808,4.992592592592593

260738,5,6300216977,"I've always enjoyed watching Mary Tyler Moore in anything she stars in. She's always stayed classy. Donald Sutherland is amazing and gives a touching performance as the father of Conrad. He's also a fantastic spouse in movies. Probably one of the most underrated actors, attractive-wise. I just can't get over how much poise and grace he carries in every scene. His son (Kiefer) doesn't compare. It's just a rarity these days.

Overall, I love the honesty between the characters. Lot's of Phaq yous going around. It's great. Dr. Berger was great too. Conrad's story is sad. His friends from school basically suck. His mom is a little over protective/under protective. I mean, I prefer his father's approach in helping with the situation. His mom really ignores the signs on purpose. Conrad starts barking in the middle of their conversation and she just leaves. Like seriously, a phone call is more amusing to her? She just strikes me as odd. A mother shouldn't be afraid of her son, but she clearly is. She doesn't know how to deal with Conrad's behavior, which comes across nicely in Moore's performance.

Conrad is a horrible swimmer. Simply put. Why stay on the team? I can't see how he could have kept the fake friendships with the jocks, so I'm glad he left that loser group. The girl he met in choir was a better pick than the rehab girl. Either way they should have hit it off with him then, at his prime libido stages. But they sucked too. Most of all, his brother sucked. For number one, dying, and number two, putting his life in Conrad's hands, ultimately leaving Conrad to blame himself for his brother's death.

Finally, the issue of the mother arises again. The real tear jerker for me happens when Conrad hugs his mother. She had no reaction. I seriously shed a tear for that moment and felt silly, but then felt ok that her husband (Sutherland) cried later. She really contributed to the family problems in the biggest way.

All in all, great family drama.",1411257600,,1973,4.69364161849711

If you've ever been in a family situation where no one wants to discuss ""the elephant in the room,"" you'll appreciate the subject of this film.

Mary Tyler Moore is outstanding; a perfectly nuanced performance of an entitled, willful, spoiled character, not incapable of loving, but unwilling to. 4 and a 1/2 stars.",1398643200,,248,5.073170731707317
260799,4,6300216977,"The first half of ORDINARY PEOPLE is uneventful, focusing mostly on the ""ordinary"" daily life of this Middle American family who, though they suffered a great tragedy in the death of their older son several years earlier and are now struggling with their younger son's depression and suicidal tendencies, seem otherwise like the Brady Bunch in their normality. {That being said, I'm not so sure the Brady Bunch were as quite as ""normal"" as their creators intended.} The first hour is so quiet and routine that it's easy to overlook the big, big conflicts going on beneath the surface, not just with the ""troubled"" surviving son but with the equally troubled ""ordinary"" parents. Though things intensify somewhat in the second half, this film may not appeal to many of today's audiences who want a lot of fast action, twists, and suspense. The acting is also rather wooden by modern standards, but I think that may have been intentional as all three members of the family are slowly, subtly revealed to be not so ""ordinary"" after all. Mary Tyler Moore gives a memorable performance as Beth the mother, a polite, apparently painfully everyday person who's entirely severed many basic connections with the human race. Calvin the father (Donald Sutherland) is the most wooden of all, but the way he's revealed to be the most neurotic in many ways, something realistically unfitting for a tax attorney, makes him convincing in the end. Likewise for younger son Conrad (Timothy Hutton), who appears to be such an everyday kid that it's easy to forget that he recently tried to ""off"" himself. The true heart and soul of this film, however, is Judd Hirsch as Berger the psychiatrist, a truly one-in-a-billion character.

ORDINARY PEOPLE is a mass of contradictions. Not a lot of big events for a two-hour film, and some will inevitably find it just plain boring. Yet, more in the way of dramatic action (longer, more detailed flashbacks to the older son's drowning and Conrad's suicide attempt, etc) would somehow have detracted from it. The mood is consistently somber, like an unusually good soap opera, but there are some truly hilarious lines scattered in, and for today's audiences the 1980 styles (particularly Calvin's plaid golf trousers) will also provide some  comic relief. Some inconsistencies that still work because they fit the theme of the film so well: As Calvin puts it, ""I guess the whole of life is an accident."" ORDINARY PEOPLE often seems like a sort of 1980s After-School Special for Adults, with a number of too-easies, but even if it isn't entirely convincing, there's something nonetheless real about it in a way that can only be accomplished through fiction. The loaded dialogue is full of hackneyed pop psychology phrases, but despite, or even because of, the frequent corniness, ORDINARY PEOPLE succeeds at being truly touching.

Disturbing subject matter and lots of realistic profanity, but nothing else (no sex/nudity or serious gore/violence) that really justifies the ""R"" rating.",1397606400,,3004,5.05241935483871

I have such admiration for Robert Redford as a person, as an actor, as an environmentalist.  This was his first foray into directing, and this is yet another great talent of his.  I've actually seen everything he's directed since, and I believe his skills as an actor make him an exceptional director.  I can't say enough good things about this movie - if you're going to spend time in front of a tv set and you're not watching an educational video or a documentary, then this kind of fictional drama is as good as it gets, because you won't feel that you wasted your time.

Timothy Hutton in a moving and touching performance plays a teenager named Conrad, who was present when his brother dies in a terrible accident. Conrad cannot come to terms with the tragedy and blames him self thinking he could have done something about it and saved his brother. He attempts to commit suicide, but his father(in a brilliant performance by Donald Sutherland)saves his life. Conrad is sent to a mental hospital to recover from the ordeal. Mean while his mother(Mary Tyler Moore) copes with the horrible tragedy by bottling everything up inside. Instead of embracing her husband and son she shuts them out. At a time when the family should have had a closer bond to deal with the events her coldness drives a wedge between her self and her son. Conrad is left to deal with his own pain about his brother's death, and the seemingly blameful and unsympathetic treatment from his mother. Judd Hirsch, in a wonderful performance, plays the psychiatrist who helps Conrad learn to cope. I loved this movie because it tells a story many families who have experienced tragedy can relate to, and because the film ends with a lot of things that are never resolved, the family ultimately in ruin. It's a depressing story yet riveting and emotional to experience.

260901,4,6300216977,"Robert Redford's directorial debut, 'Ordinary People,' which won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Picture, is an interesting, intelligent, and often insightful film which in many ways can be seen as kicking off American 80s cinema, arguably the last great era of American filmmaking thus far.

Adapted from Judith Guest's novel of the same name, 'Ordinary People' is three-fourths a great film. The first ninety minutes are beautifully written, acted, and produced, but 'Ordinary People' lacks a satisfying climax or resolution, even if the ending of both the source novel and the screenplay were intended to be 'realistic' or 'life-like,' and therefore rather unresolved, even arbitrary.

Since teenage protagonist Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) doesn't share his climatic spirit-freeing realization that he's suffering 'survivor's guilt' over his brother's death with either of his parents, we never learn whether his emotionally cold and extraverted mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), has been  unconsciously holding his brother's death against him for the same reason.

Though Beth is something approaching the villain of the film, her character deserves the  opportunity to undergo the same catharsis that Conrad does.

Instead, on a moment's notice, after a tense confrontation with husband Calvin (Donald Sutherland), she, in rather absurd, unconvincing, and stereotypical fashion, packs a suitcase, gets into a taxi, and drives off to live with her family in Texas.

Though the novel ends in the same way, it is a woefully weak manner in which to close the film, especially since it has been made clear throughout that Beth favored her first child, the now-dead Buck, over Conrad, and was even unconsciously enamored of him.

So 'Ordinary People' bravely approaches Freud's concept of psychologically incestuous 'family romance,' but then slinks away from it in cowardly fashion.

As a result, the film loses momentum in its last thirty minutes, and is ultimately unsatisfying. The viewer is left with the impression that Redford simply dropped the ball.

Redford's involvement generated a lot of interest in the film at the time of its release, as did the novel casting of famous television comedian Mary Tyler Moore as the self-centered, ostensibly cold-blooded Beth.

But audiences who closely followed the precedent-setting 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' (1970-1977) during its run probably were less surprised, since, in the show's fifth season, Moore's optimistic, sweet-natured character, Mary Richards, took a decided turn for the worse, becoming inexplicably and unexplainably frustrated, brittle, and peevish. The Beth Jarrett of 'Ordinary People' was born right there in 1975, on Moore's own program.

Moore, who was also nominated for an Oscar, does a credible job in the somewhat thankless role as the mannish Beth, especially in her chilly scenes with Hutton.

Despite its title, 'Ordinary People' is really about upper middle class WASPs, their values, and their modes of expression and repression, who, even in the 1970s and early 1980s, couldn't really be considered 'ordinary people,' in the sense that the phrase potentially referred to 'the average American.'

The Jarretts are a privileged upper middle class professional family who live in a large two-story home in a prosperous Chicago suburb; Calvin and Beth attend 'causal parties' at the home of their adult friends in which the men are nonetheless dressed in suits and ties. Calvin and Beth play golf, and belong to tony country clubs. Conrad, barring his mental health, is expected to go away to college after his high school graduation.

In this sense, the film is one of the most notable American films specifically about WASPs as such. Conrad and his young friends, as well as their parents, appear as if they've stepped out of Lisa Birnbach's 'The Official Preppy Handbook,' also released in 1980.

The viewer cannot help thinking that it was this WASP aspect of the novel, and its partial inditement of high WASP culture, which attracted the politically liberal Redford to the project.

Mental illness and suicide among WASPs, and an apparent inability to communicate effectively, were greatly in the cinematic air of the period: Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' (1977), 'Interiors' (1978) and 'Stardust Memories' (1980), and Lawrence Kasdan's 'The Big Chill' (1983) all addressed mentally and emotionally troubled upper class Anglo-Americans.

'Ordinary People' is full of terrific performances, especially from Timothy Hutton as the suicidal Conrad, and Donald Sutherland, who actually retracts his broad acting range to play a believable upper middle class WASP father and tax accountant. Judd Hirsch also shines as Conrad's pragmatic and unorthodox psychiatrist, Dr. Berger.

In much smaller parts , Elizabeth McGovern and Dinah Manoff create three-dimensional, shadow-casting characters out of fairly generic secondary roles.",1356566400,3,4910,5.453825857519789

260905,5,6300216977,"Ordinary People is an extraordinary film and is almost certainly the best movie ever which deals with the break down of an American family.  The ordinary people of the title are not ordinary - they are a highly affluent family, but who suffer the loss of a favorite child.  Their affluence does not shield them from the all to ordinary consequences of this tragedy.

There is nothing ordinary about this film from Robert Redford's steller direction to the suburb acting of the family - the father Donald Sutherland, the mother Mary Tyler Moore and the surviving son Timothy Hutton.  Special kudos must be given to Mary Tyler Moore whose cold, unsympathetic portrayal of the mother, in complete contrast to her spunky TV roles in the Mary Tyler Moore Show and the Dick van Dyke Show, is a performance for the ages (how she could have lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Sissy Spacek for The Coal Minor's Daughter is mind boggling).  The supporting roles of Judd Hirsh (another dramatic turn for a comedic TV actor from Taxi) and Elizabeth McGovern, in her first film role (the mother from Downton Abbey) are equally brilliant.

There is not a false note in this movie from the opening panoramic view of the location to the very personal bittersweet ending.  The fact that the film is not ranked in the AFT's Greatest 100 Films is a travesty - it should be in the top twenty!",1355356800,,1380,4.654320987654321
260906,5,6300216977,"Robert Redford's film Ordinary People is an amazing and heart-wrenching movie.  I mean it has it all: the dysfunctional family, tragic death, post-traumatic stress disorder, survivor's guilt, and amazing multi-dimensional characters.  It's so riveting, emotionally building to the climax and then to the sad and desperate ending.  THEMES of grief and sorrow; atonement and forgiveness; alienation and loneliness and identity prevail.

The story of a teenaged boy's journey back from a suicide attempt after his older brother's death in a boating accident, and the grief and guilt that tear the Jarrett's apart, Ordinary People was an instant best-seller (Judith Guest). Guest's themes of alienation, the search for identity, and coming of age were timely ones, as the 1970s saw a trend toward self-discovery. Thus, psychology plays a key role in the novel, as young Conrad learns to express rather than repress his emotions with the help of a psychiatrist, while his mother's inability to confront her feelings leads her to leave her husband and son.

AND, I absolutely love the tagline: ""Everything is in its proper place...except the past."" Classic Academy Award Winner for Best Picture...""some films you watch, others you feel.""  THIS IS A MUST SEE CLASSIC.",1355097600,2,1260,5.338383838383838

There is no violence here, no F-bombs, no sex..just the secrets of an upper-class family coming apart amid cocktail parties and Christmas shopping at Neiman Marcus. Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore live in  a big house, have lots of well-to-do friends, and are mourning the loss of their oldest son and the near-suicide of their remaining son - played beautifully by Timothy Hutton. Wracked by Survivor's Guilt, Hutton's Conrad Jarrett tries without success to emulate his older brother and suffers endless disdain from his Mother, played like an iceberg by Moore, in a departure from her cheery sitcom personna. As Conrad begins to trust his new Doctor (Judd Hirsch), his finally starts dealing with his feelings. Sutherland is the sympathetic Father who tries to deal with his son's issues, only to discover a few of his own. This is powerful stuff - with great performances from a great ensemble cast. Director Robert Redford makes this seem so real - especially the performances of Hutton and Moore. Hutton is sweet, vunerable, and slightly annoying - he does angst beautifully. Oddly enough I found Moore as the most affecting: her dogged determination to ""keep up appearances""  results in an icy personna as she is happy to buy her son $75 shirts but can't show any affection to her son or her husband. It all adds up to a classic film that still moves you many years later.",1338681600,3,1566,4.835820895522388

260916,5,6300216977,"To me Ordinary People is a very important film in that it chronicles well the life and times of a suburban family in the year 1980 firstly. Looking at the movie is a special experience in that I am able to recollect on simpler family discussions agendas and types of squabbles back in that era a far cry from infinite complexity and child rearing issues in 2012 and on. I am always happy about this movie because it is a special experience to see as it subtly captures life in the north shore Chicago suburbs at through out the year as we are taken through the seasons in a classical format. It's the type of cinematic sensitivity that is of secondary concern these days. A type of golden age approach. Seeing the film is like a breath of fresh as we go back across the ""sands of time"" to an age well before cell phones, computers, massive change and even acts of terrorism.

While they live a bit better than many people, their roots are ordinary--and more to the point, so are their emotions and their fate.

Thus I dislike what Robert Redford did--his direction is as subtle as a sledge hammer in taking an upper middle class family and making them fat-cat caricatures who, instead of living in a very nice house, dwell in a Huge Cold Mansion. The boy's barking scene with the mother is also a gross violation of his nature as depicted in the novel (and probably even of how he's otherwise shown in the movie). Redford seems to have no compassion for the mother. In the novel, she was flawed and blocked emotionally, while suffering greatly herself, without being so frigid and basically evil.

260931,5,6300216977,"***POSSIBLE  SPOILERS***

The loss of a loved one may be one of the most powerfully profound situations that people find themselves in.  And at some point, it is something that everyone must deal with at some time, and on some level.  Life has a way of throwing us curve balls.  We tell ourselves that we are ready for our parents to pass on when they reach old age, but life invariably never follows that protocol.  After losing my own father to an accident when I was just 19, I was suddenly forced to deal with the pain, grief, and anger that seems to coincide with such a tragedy.

""Ordinary People"" is about a Midwestern family trying to deal with the loss of a child to a tragic boating accident.  One of the things that makes this film so powerful is that it is something that can happen to anyone.  If you've suffered loss, you find yourself relating to one of the three main characters.  If you haven't, you still find yourself on some level, identifying or getting a taste of what that loss might look like through the eyes and feelings of one or more of these characters.

This was Robert Redford's directorial debut, and he deservedly took home the Oscar for Best Director.  He keeps things simple.  He doesn't let the story or the character become too bogged down in melo-drama, but allows the characters of the story to keep it moving.  The feeling is that this could (and does) happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time.

Aside from the masterful direction, Redford chooses one of history's most powerful musical pieces that sounds as if it came from heaven itself: Pachebel's Canon in D Major.  The irony of this particular piece is that it can go with just about any life situation...times when you feel the most joyous and happy, and those times when you feel down or depressed...on any level, it works.  And there are several particularly powerful moments when this piece of music is used.  Several scenes start off with this song being introduced very slowly, one note at a time, on a piano, and one cannot help but be moved by it.

The performances in this film are all top-notch.  Of the three main actors, I felt that Mary Tyler Moore, as Beth Jarrett, turned in the best performance of her career.  Her character is operating on so many levels.  She is trying to keep her family together.  She fights against the changes that have occurred, and she follows the ""old"" belief that grief and pain should be dealt with within the family, and not by outsiders.  The irony of this belief is that Beth, herself, is unable to deal with it, which explains why she cannot relate with her husband, and especially her son, while they try to.  Instead, Beth Jarrett chooses to lose herself in outside situations such as traveling, visiting friends and relatives, and basically doing anything to keep herself from having to think and relive the tragedy of losing one son and nearly losing the other as well.  She is like someone living inside of a glass bubble, fearful that anyone or anything might shatter it and reveal that she isn't nearly as strong as the faade she puts on; that she needs healing as much as Conrad.  She's hurting and in pain, but the sad part is that she will not recognize this, let alone accept it.  I feel that much of the resentment she conveys toward her son is because, through him, she cannot help but see her own pain...a pain she does not want to acknowledge or deal with.

Donald Sutherland turned in an equally powerful performance as Calvin Jarrett.  He feels the loss just as bitterly as his wife and son, and yet he is the one trying to figure out a way to keep the family intact.  In a sense, he is the glue trying to hold everything together.  He goes so far as to encourage his son to seek professional help, because even Calvin and Beth have no idea what Conrad is dealing with, since Conrad doesn't open up or share with anyone.  Sometimes, the love of a parent must be in the realization of, ""I love you so much, that I know I am unable to help you, and so I am going to find someone who can.""  Calvin is this type of parent.  In many ways, even though he is the father, he takes on motherly traits.  He is affectionate, and he is trying very hard to get through to his son and to let him know how much he loves him.

Timothy Hutton took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Conrad Jarrett.  He gives us a harrowing and even frightening depiction of a young man who is not only dealing with the loss of his brother, but also the guilt and responsibility that he feels that led to his brother's death.  Conrad feels cut-off from his family, and mostly from his mother who he feels hates him.  Conrad feels that she possibly even adds to his own sense of guilt by causing him to feel responsible for the loss of the one person with whom his mother related to the most: his brother.  Reluctantly, he seeks out professional help from Dr. Berger (wonderfully played by Judd Hirsch), and as the subsequent therapy sessions progress, Dr. Berger helps him to see that life often gives no reasons or explanations for what has happened, and that it is only in the letting go of the anger and guilt that Conrad can begin the healing process and move on with his life.

""Ordinary People"" is about every-day people, which is why the title of this film is so aptly named.  The story and performances are heart-felt and powerful, but in a subtle way.  Nothing is over-the-top, and neither are the characters, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves easily relating to them.  Even over 30 years later, I still feel that this is one of the most poignantly powerful films I have ever seen, and it still easily holds up today.  The story demonstrates that ""bad"" things happen, and very often, there is no reason as to why, but that true healing begins in the acknowledgement of the anger and the pain, and that it is only in the ""letting go"" of the anger and guilt that healing can finally take place.",1325808000,4,5968,4.469067405355494
260932,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" is not a loud movie. As a family drama, it's often compared to ""American Beauty,"" another film I admire. What differentiates ""Ordinary People"" from ""American Beauty"" is its subtleness. ""American Beauty"" is comparatively loud. It crackles with repressed homosexuality and ends in a murder. ""Ordinary People"" has neither sublimated sexuality nor a shooting. What ""Ordinary People"" does have, however, is an excellent director in Robert Redford, whose ability to stage, direct, and photograph his actors is extraordinary. If you're someone who appreciates the craft of filmmaking, you'll very much enjoy ""Ordinary People."" Camera angles and softer focus shots, for example, are used to great effect to further the story and create a sense of place. The acting is first-rate, but that's no surprise, given the billing of Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, and Timothy Hutton, who won an Oscar for his performance. ""Ordinary People"" is very much a five-star film, but know what you're in for -- if you expect a fast-paced plot and explosive drama, you'll be disappointed.",1324512000,2,1086,5.356725146198831
260933,5,6300216977,"This is one of those films which never fails to make my list of favourites.  What I find interesting is that, over the years, I can go back to it and find new things each time.  I have also noticed that, while I first felt for the character of Conrad, I now see the pathos of Mary Tyler Moore's character as well.  That's the mark of a good film.
""Ordinary People"" was presented to me in its book incarnation by a school librarian who had noted my reading pattern.  ""I think you'll like this,"" she said.  I hope those librarians are still around, for she was correct.  Robert Redford did Judith Guest""s novel justice, for far too many versions spoil the print version.
Robert Redford caught those minor details that show us things about a character.  For example, Beth arranges the napkins ever so carefully. He perfectly captures the discomfort of the mother and the son when they have to stand near each other.  The director does not feel the need to hit us over the head to have us see the family dynamics.  This was filmed at a time before people blogged and openly spoke about their issues.  Yet, Robert Redford seems to understand the suffering of PTSD victims.  Conrad, played by Tim Hutton, had spent a length of time in a mental institution for attempting suicide.  As the movie evolves, one learns that it relates to his guilt relating to the death of his brother.
The acting is excellent and Redford took a risk in hiring Mary Tyler Moore to play the emotionally disconnected mother, for at the time she was known for her perky roles.
There are many poignant moments in this film.  One which really resonates for me is a scene where Conrad describes his descent into depression and inability to escape it.

This movie faithfully evokes what is perhaps the most troubling part of ordinary life--that of loosing (or coming close to loosing) a loved one.  It is this movie--more than any other movie of my acquaintance--that faithfully reveals this world to the audience.

Of the many iconic scenes in this movie, one is particularly striking to me--where Elizabeth McGovern's character Jeannine ventures to ask Timothy Hutton's Conrad Jarrett about his suicide attempt--a question that his other friends have dared not ask.

260942,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" strikes a cord deep in family issues that most keep hiding forever
 in their hearts - forgiveness.

 Death in the family is hard enough to deal with, but ""Ordinary People""  shows us its possible to
 even forgive someone, like your own mother, for not expressly her love for you like you feel
 it was expressed for an older (or younger) sibling.

 Mary Tyler Moore does a supreme job playing the unforgiving mother, while Timothy Hutton
 won the best supporting actor award for the role of Conrad who is riddled with guilt for
 the death of his older brother and pays a price for it at the hands of his mother.

 Forgiveness is one thing many of us will never be able to experience, because so many of
 us never even forgive ourselves for our shortcomings.  This film is so solid, it was won
 the Best Picture Academy award in 1980 - a year that most experts thought would be
 won by ""Raging Bull"" - but ""Ordinary People"" won because this film is about finding solace
 in a world riddled by humanity as being ""unfair to life"" - and where ""Raging Bull"" loses is
 where it dwells on the negative results of life and ""Ordinary People"" wins with compassion,
 forgiveness, and the hunger for inner peace inside our souls we so crave when we stumble
 in our own weaknesses.

I am a clinical psychologist. Myself and my classmates studied this movie 20+ years ago when I was in graduate school.  This movie has the truest theatrical representation of how the patient/psychotherapist relationship develops and how the patient is helped from this sincere,  trust filled relationship.

The therapeutic style represented in the movie seems to me to be a ""gestalt/psychodynamic"" based therapy.  This therapy does not ""psychoanalyze"" the patient, but focuses on what is happening in the moment and a real (albeit professional) relationship developes between doctor and patient. The patient is subsequently helped by the strength of this relationship (Gestalt). This therapy process also helps the father and son become aware of the underlying unconscious forces that impact their feelings, self-perceptions, and behavior.

The psychotherapeutic relationship is ""Gestalt/psychodynamic"" in nature, but the movie script is a classic psychological study of psychodynamic unconscious processes.  We see how people respond to powerful unconscious impulses. The two people in the movie who have the courage to look for and eventually see their unconscious defensive reactions are saved.  The person who is too afraid to examine hidden motivations is set adrift in an empty sea of emotional pain, filled with the eventual and unescaple loneliness that results from a life based on looking good rather than doing well.

Director Robert Redford, in his directorial debut, makes cinematic perfection with the screenplay by Alvin Sargent (from the best selling novel by Judith Guest). Redford stays extremely true to the novel by Judith Guest and extracts exceptional performances from Hutton, Donald Sutherland (dad), Mary Tyler Moore (mom), the shrink (Judd Hirsch), the girlfriend (Elizabeth Perkins), and the swim coach (M. Emmet Walsh). It was Best Picture, Best Director (Redford in his debut), Best Supporting Actor (Hutton), and best Adapted Screenplay (Alvin Sargent - wrote Unfaithful).

Conrad Jarett (Timothy Hutton) is a teenager struggling with trying to kill himself after his brother's accidental death but is now out of the hospital and seeing Doctor Burger (Judd Hirsh). The movie is seamless going from one scene to the next much akin to anxiety. It takes you into Conrad's struggles through the film, his father's (Sutherland) struggle with his own guilt, and his mom's (Mary Tyler Moore) disaffection for her son. The family falls apart even though dad is trying to keep it together while Conrad is in deep introspection and finding out who he really is inside. He's not his brash brother.

Conrad and his shrink's exchanges are poignant, deep, and sometimes hilarious. He knows just when to push Connie. He knows when to let Connie vent. Even Dad goes to see him. Mom just can't seem to engage emotionally making Moore's performance something to behold. You see her anger or loss of feeling for Connie from the beginning while dad is supportive. While Conrad conquers his demons, they tear their marriage apart.

One of the best lines is ""Where there's a real problem, there's a real answer."" Hutton's brilliant depiction of going through suicidal ideas is breathtaking.

The beginning and the ending are brilliant. All in-between is a collage of a family falling apart while the son is facing his demons with success. The movie is deep with raw emotion from everyone. It'll make you laugh, cry, and look deep inside yourself. I've seen it maybe 50 or so times. The classical music throughout just makes it even more emotionally driven.

260951,5,6300216977,"A very realistic look at how an ""ordinary"" suburban family is affected by a young man's accidental death.  Timothy Hutton stars as the neglected younger brother whose feelings of guilt have led him to a failed suicide attempt.  His recovery, and how he and his family attempt to return to some kind of normalcy, is the focus of the film.  His father (Donald Sutherland) tries to be understanding, but doesn't know how to help him, while his mother (played by Mary Tyler Moore) is distant and often antagonistic, unable to get beyond the loss of her beloved first-born; she just wants to get away from the son who she can't help but blame. Judd Hirsch is excellent as the psychiatrist who is helping our protagonist through his depression and isolation.

This was Robert Redford's directorial debut, and every detail is just spot on.  The whole film is so powerful yet so convincing one can't help but be moved by it.  All of the actors are perfect in their roles (most of them were nominated for Oscars) and every shot is as natural as if we were sitting there with them.  In terms of plotting, most of the ""action"" has occurred before the film starts; we'll see enough to get the picture.  Rather than wallow in the physical horrors of a young man's death, Redford is trying to show how people deal with tragedy in their lives, or fail to, and how difficult it is for us ""ordinary people"" to talk about the things that really matter to us, even (especially) with the people we care most about.  A triumph of naturalism in filmmaking.

All that said, this is a very somber film, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.

260953,5,6300216977,"The subtle nuance of human interaction and relationships isn't so much what is said--but what is not said.  A pause.  A gesture.  A glance.  Nonverbal cues betray our true feelings and emotions; they amplify our thoughts.  Which is one of the major reasons (out of many) I so very much enjoy ORDINARY PEOPLE, Robert Redford's haunting, often disturbing film depicting family pain and dysfunction.  Although this film ushered in the Eighties--with its layered hairstyles and wacky threads--ORDINARY PEOPLE is completely and totally timeless; no matter what the period, people are people.  That's the simplistic beauty of this movie.

All of us cope with tragedy in our own way--and when a tight-knit family of four loses a member (its firstborn son) to a boating accident, while the other son survives, the tragedy can become unbearable.  The grief.  The loss.  The pain.  The guilt.  Into this painful world the viewer is introduced to an affluent upper middle class family:  Calvin, Beth, and Conrad.  Conrad (Timothy Hutton), who watched his brother drown, has attempted suicide, misses his time spent in the hospital (a refuge from an insurmountable world), and only wants to find some inner peace and control to relieve his guilt.  Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is a classic case of repression; bottling everything up inside, she puts on a Stepford-type facade and allows no one to penetrate the veneer--especially Conrad, who she blames for her other son's death.  Yet Calvin (Donald Sutherland) moves me the most as the grieving, compassionate father trying to hold his fragile family together.  His pain is immeasurable as he tries to help his son and come to grips about his loveless wife.  Judd Hirsch is also remarkable playing Conrad's shrink; his straight-forward, shoot from the hip style furnishes Conrad with his only true emotional outlet.

ORDINARY PEOPLE is beautiful, poignant, jarring, painful, and compelling.  Made decades ago, Redford's message is timeless:  We as people may be ordinary, but our interactions and relationships are anything but.

260954,5,6300216977,"I've never typed a review before now, although I've greatly benefited in the past from others' comments and analyses.  But I just saw ""Ordinary People"" two days ago, and it's stuck with me like very few movies have before, so I felt compelled to share my two cents.  I'm a 26-year-old guy who generally prefers action and suspense movies--I'm a BIG fan of ""The Italian Job"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  If I saw this movie through a preview or even just an excerpt of it, I'd honestly and most likely disregard it as just another ""chick flick,"" which makes me humbled and outright stunned at the magnitude that this movie resonated with me.

If you're reading this review, then you've probably read (or plan to read) others like it, so I won't dwell on the storyline; here it is in a few sentences: Affluent Chicago suburb.  Teenage son clearly bothered/distracted by something, but we don't find out 'til later that it's the premature, accidental death of his older brother.  Dad seemed pleasant enough, especially in spite of the tragic circumstances, but mom appeared rather terse and distant.  Nobody wanted to disclose their intense montage of emotions, and that created a (partially) irreconcilable rift within the family of three by the conclusion of the movie.  The crux of this movie exposed how each family member confronted his/her own emotions.

It may not seem that worthy from my succinct summary, but you can find a brief synopsis of the movie almost anywhere.  I'd rather use this space to explain why I found it so memorable.

Simply put, in my humble opinion, the cast presented understandable, everyday characters.  With Donald Sutherland as the dad, Mary Tyler Moore as the mom, and Timothy Hutton as the son, you witness an intimate, realistic character study through the superb direction of Robert Redford.  Some have said that after 30 years, ""Ordinary People"" has become just that--ordinary.  But I feel that's exactly why I connected with these characters as much as I did.  Their complex emotional states resulted from death, something that everybody must face from time to time.  While memorable albeit devastating movies exist that discuss the impacts of direct and tangential family calamities like divorce, rape, and incest, I think it can be more difficult to connect with characters in those situations and really feel their pain if one has not experienced it in his/her own life.  But all of us are forced to deal with death in some way--grandparents, parents, friends, and in the case of this movie--a sibling/child.

Timothy Hutton's performance as Conrad simply amazed me.  I can see why he earned the Oscar for his role in this movie; I found it quite gripping and relatable.  He just nailed it.  Personally, I have not lost a brother, but I have lost a friend (in a horrific car accident), and I noticed several parallels in his character's personality with my own.  He's presumably an introvert who prefers to keep his emotions all bottled up inside because he doesn't want to ""bother anybody"" or draw attention to himself.  We're told further into the movie that he's a smart kid--an 'A' student with at least two extracurricular activities as well--who, in the past, never really needed a parental ""kick in the rear"" to stay motivated or on track.  I suspect that he's a rather independent person who initially thought that since he's been able to figure out his problems before, he can certainly work through this one too.  Of course, that's not the case, as evidenced by his recent suicide attempt.  But still, that mindset--determining personal boundaries (i.e., knowing when you need help), discerning when personal problems should remain private, handling grief and emotional turmoil--who hasn't had to negotiate these at some point?

He even says to his dad toward the end of the movie: ""I wasn't putting out many signals then.  I really don't think you could've done anything.""  Recalling my teenage years, that's exactly how I was!  And that, I believe, makes it easier to at least understand the parents' actions.

I'm not a parent, so I found it much easier to connect with Conrad and his journey, but I suppose that if I become one in the future, I'll have a newfound appreciation for the parents' reactions to this death in the family.  So many have ripped Mary Tyler Moore's character, and while I agree--she really is terrible at times--to an extent, I also can sort of see her vantage point too.  She's just buried one son, and then, in a fit a guilt and desperation, her only other son tried to take his own life?!  There are also subtle moments in the movie when she attempted to connect with Conrad (e.g., bringing him a sweater when he's outside), but those simple gestures did not mitigate her loathsome stares and obvious resentment.  Donald Sutherland's character's emotional flaw is that he sees what he wants to see.  He doesn't want to worry about Conrad because he hasn't had to before the death of his brother; in fact, one wonders if he even knows how to express concern for his son's behavior?  With Conrad's withdrawn, isolated demeanor, I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for a parent to deal with that in addition to his/her own emotions in wake of tragedy.

If you're still reading this review, then it probably sounds like I've just provided a glorified report for you.  But that's really what surprised me the most with this movie: its simplicity.  There are no chase scenes, gratuitous violence, or nudity; rather, it's just people interacting with one another.  Who knew that this kind of movie could invoke such a lasting effect?  And on top of that, one produced in 1980, three years before I was born!",1268524800,5,5697,4.8429752066115705
260955,5,6300216977,"This is a absolutely wonderful and convincing film about affluent middle America and how a family confronts a tragedy that is outside of its normal control.  It is a story of change that is thrust upon people who are extremely secure in their environment, who are not used to things they cannot immediately master, dismiss, or anesthetize by a cushion of money and supportive relationships.

The story centers on a sensitive and gifted younger son, who is caught in an existential anxiety that he cannot control.  Timothy Hutton delivers what I think is the finest performance of his career, his every gesture displaying the turmoil he is feeling inside.  He cannot feel anything, he complains, and is heading for another breakdown.  He deserved the Oscar for it.  But Donald Sutherland is also great as his father, who is struggling to cope with issues he has never confronted.  Finally, in perhaps her most subtle role, Mary Tyler Moore is the mother; afraid of genuine emotion, she had long been content to live in a comfortable predictability, long accustomed her role and milieu.  They are all reacting to unspeakable pain in their own ways, revealing their strengths and capacities.

The final character in the film is Chicago's North Shore, a community that must be experienced to be believed. Redford portrays it with a sensitivity that is astonishing and not in the slightest condescending in spite of his many comical touches.  I grew up there and still feel it is more or less home, though I have long since left.  The place is one of the most affluent yet least cultured places in the US.  Its residents feel entitled to a natural continuation of their family patterns:  get a good job, probably related to finance in Chicago, and live a comfortable life of local prestige and style. I do not mean to imply that their lives are superficial or empty, just largely unquestioned and unquestioning, preoccupied with the generation of wealth and perpetuation of their ""class standing"" (for want of a better term).  However, if something disrupts this cocoon - personal tragedy, economic upheaval, or just not fitting in - they are forced to leave their comfort zone, often with devastating results but also with the potential to grow.

The plot of the film is about the son, Conrad, as he begins to see a wonderful psychiatrist, who is completely straight with him as well as caring.  They develop a powerful relationship, a space where Conrad can be himself and experiment with a new way of being.  While the father is open to it, the mother refuses to recognize Conrad's struggle.  The results are surprising as the equilibrium of the family shifts fundamentally.

Redford's film raises all of these issues with perfect emotional pitch.  I watched it with my daughter (14); our family had lived in the area for a couple of years - kind of a sabbatical from our home in Europe, to be near my parents.  She saw places we knew, recognized the types of people, and also learned about psychiatry (my father was a psychiatrist).  We were both moved to tears by the story and the outstanding acting and talked a lot about the film afterwards.  It is true art about what I have long viewed as an artless place.

Warmly recommended.  With the many subtleties in it, this film can be watched many times.",1263427200,2,3302,4.801769911504425
260956,5,6300216977,"The moving film 'Ordinary People' details a family recovering from one son's accidental death and another son's failed suicide attempt. Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) is the teenage son, dealing with post-traumatic stress; he almost died along with his brother, whom he watched drown, and memories of his near suicide hang over him. Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), his mother, plays the perfect housewife, beautiful, active, charming, and all too practical. Calvin (Donald Sutherland), the compassionate father, is caught between his fragile son and brittle wife. We follow the parents, as they receive unhelpful advice from friends and colleagues, and Conrad, as he attempts to readjust to school life after returning from a psychiatric hospital. A psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), causes Conrad to confront his feelings.

Robert Redford emphasizes the pristine homes of affluent families and their amusingly mundane small talk, masking the deeper issues in these individuals' lives. The dialogue is funny, introspective, and believable. Because of the presence of a psychiatrist and a focus on intense emotional upheaval, characters delve deep into feelings. Sometimes the theories and speeches come across as dated and affected; symbols and realizations are at times overdone. Still, the film holds up remarkably well after thirty years.

The acting is all around excellent. Hutton is lovely as the awkward Conrad, internally tumultuous and outwardly tense. As the genial but passive father, Sutherland ably portrays Calvin's desire to appease his wife and aid his pained but impenetrable son. Moore is remarkable as Beth, a woman whose intense selfishness, resentment, and fear emerge as smiling, rigid perfectionism. Hirsch's is an appealing presence in a rare positive portrayal of a psychiatrist, and Conrad's teenage peers, both obtuse and guileless, are realistic.

Pachelbel's Canon comprises almost the entire, spare score. This can be grating, but other melodies are usually blessedly subtle. 'Ordinary People' ultimately suffers a touch from time and contrivance, but, overall, it a powerful, therapeutic depiction of a family striving to push through grief and depression.",1255564800,,2187,5.641337386018237

260969,4,6300216977,"Ordinary People, (1980), is a four-time Oscar winning film that takes place in Chicago, IL and tells a tale that could be quite common in many a suburban household.  Donald Sutherland stars as Calvin, the father who tries desperately to keep his crumbling family together. Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth, the uptight mother who is subtley tearing the family apart--an about-face of a character for her.  Timothy Hutton steals the film as Conrad, the angst-ridden son who secretly believes he is responsible for his brother's death.  Judd Hirsch stars as Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who Conrad seeks out for help in dealing with the family he cannot relate to and his past, which haunts him daily.

Conrad's brother, Buck, is accidentally killed in a boating accident and because of this, Conrad attempts suicide and spends four months in the hospital afterwards.  This story picks up upon Conrad's arrival back home and focuses on his family's reception of him, (which isn't exactly satisfying), and Conrad's attempt to deal with his past while getting on with his future.  Beth is more focused on keeping her social calendar packed and avoiding judgments from others on her family than she is on actually keeping her family together.  Conrad assumes that she hates him and that Buck was the favorite and in watching her actions toward him, the audience can only side with him.  She is cold, uncaring and nothing means more to her than who she is having dinner with or where she can vacation for Christmas.  Calvin tries to show his son that he cares about him and that he only wants to help, but Conrad is averse to his attention and seeks solace in Dr. Berger.  Dr. Berger is one of the most likable characters in this film.  Psychologists and psychiatrists tend to be better characters in films because they shed light on the problems that are happening beneath the surface.  At one point, Conrad finds himself in a tense situation when a tragic event occurs and he realizes that the only way he can save himself is if he can contact Dr. Berger in time.  Elizabeth McGovern shines as cheerful Jeannine Pratt, the only person Conrad's age who he can possibly trust and who can maybe save him from himself.

Timothy Hutton received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film and it is clear that it was well-deserved.  Conrad is so riddled with angst and depression that he makes for a very believable character.  One can relate to certain scenes in the movie where Conrad feels like he has nowhere to turn, like the world has turned on him and he can't find peace no matter how he tries.  This movie was also Robert Redford's directorial debut and has been thoroughly praised for his direction on this film.  Four oscars aren't bad for a directorial debut!  The tagline for this film read, ""some films you watch, others you feel.""  This is quite the accurate statement since no matter what you feel, whether it's hatred for Beth's ambivalence, sympathy for Conrad's troubled mind, or satisfaction with Calvin's final decision, you will feel something for this movie when it's over.",1247616000,,3086,4.79773156899811

260976,5,6300216977,"Since this movie was released in theaters in the '80's, it has been one of my all-time favorites.  Each time I watch it, something new strikes me.  The truths are not always obvious, ""new"" details strike at each viewing.  This movie stands alone in its quiet truths about a family's difficulties: following a series of tragedies involving their two sons: the accidental death of the older son, and the attempted sucide of the younger son Conrad, played by Timothy Hutton. The story opens when Conrad is desperately trying to move past his self-blame.  The various reactions to these events are what the story is about; subsequent emotions are either slowly revealed or more stubbornly squelched as in the case of the mother, played by Mary Tyler Moore.  High school friends are also grieving and relationships are so realistically altered forever.  That is real life.  The character studies are absolutely brilliant, as is the web of relationships as they are also revealed and further developed.  The acting is convincing and I would even say, in my opinion, perfect.  While all is superbly handled in this film, to me, from the first time I've seen it, above all this is Timothy Hutton's movie.  His portrayal of young Conrad is heart-wrenching and so incredibly sincere.  How he expresses in voice, facial expression, and posture his emotional turmoil is nothing short of genius.  His character has been dealt a cruel hand to play and he is having much difficulty, but as he faces his own emotions, this has a chain effect in every direction, from his relationships and activities in high school, to his relationship with his parents, inadvertently causing them to also deal with their own emotions (or not).  The kindness and insight of his psychiatrist is played beautifully by Judd Hirsch. This movie has become a seasonal tradition to launch autumn and the following holiday season.  The visual effects of beautiful fall colors, warm lighting, stark emptiness of that overly tidy house, and the normalcy of high school activities all work together to round out the ordinary surrounding of these ""Ordinary People.""",1230595200,2,2120,5.02

260983,4,6300216977,"Every family isn't perfect, and has its issues. Some families have scars and pain that threaten to destroy them, like the family in this film: three ordinary people.

I had never seen Ordinary People until recently. I was a teen when it appeared in movie theaters. The film got Academy Awards for Director (Robert Redford, his first directing venture), Adapted Screenplay (Alvin Sargent), and Supporting Actor (Timothy Hutton). Mary Tyler Moore was nominated as Best Actress for her very solid performance as the complex and flawed Beth Jarrett. Judd Hirsch got a nod for Supporting Actor.

What strikes me about this film is that it is brimming over with tension.
Wife and mother Beth maintains her well adjusted appearance at all costs, even if it means alienating her immediate family. She has swept her pain and grief under the rug. Wound up very tightly like a perfect bow on a gift, she is chiefly concerned with keeping up appearances and a life that seems normal and content. She shuns the truth and emotions. Vacations and golf help her stay numb and distracted. Her husband Calvin knows that things are not right, but will not admit it to himself. He is in denial about his family, and about how he truly feels.
The film's core is teenaged son Conrad; he is eaten up by his massive guilt over a family tragedy. Normally it should be the best time of his life. But he is a walking open sore, a raw nerve. Beth and Conrad are both repressed in many ways. She keeps a frosty distance from him, not even showing her child affection of any kind. He loses the friendship of his best buddy in school because of his angst and antisocial tendencies. Ironically, a good friend is the one thing that Conrad desperately needs at the moment, although he doesn't realize it. He refuses to reach out to others to help him endure the immense pain and conflict. There is heavy dysfunction in this family.

Every performance is exceptional among the four main characters. But I believe the most interesting has to be Mary Tyler Moore's role. It is not easy to convey what her character is about. She has to walk a thin line between mother and monster. This is not a big, showy role. Far from it. There are so many subtle qualities and nuances to the character. Everything Moore does is spot on: body language, posture, expressions. It must have been a real challenge for this actress, after years of playing perky Mary Richards in a sitcom on TV. She really showed her acting chops here in Ordinary People.

I must confess that throughout this film I felt a growing hatred for the character of Beth. But then I realize that she has gone through hell and just doesn't know how to cope any longer. She is a sad soul, and the worst part is that her life seems so normal from the outside... but inside she has died a bit. And it's damage that can't be undone.

Robert Redford's directorial debut film ORDINARY PEOPLE is still the single,most profound revealing of the family full of secrets that must keep its thin veneer from cracking exposing the truth: ordinary people,you and I,our friends, our work companions,may be living a guise of happiness and perfect and complete tranquility, while all the while suffering severely from secret guilt and shame,and having no where to turn!

The film singlehandedly opened the doors for me,personally,in the Summer of 1980, to delving into my ""perfect family"" past. I can credit no other source than this Mary Tyler Moore,Donald Sutherland,Timothy Hutton,Judd Hirsch acted expose on what  first coined the term ""the dysfunctional family""-a phrase that hitherto was not known,but has become a household staple (pun intended)since this film was released.

ORDINARY PEOPLE is a timeless piece of art that will never go out of fashion. Why? Because the truth that this film enlightens never goes away:many (99% with the other 1% still in denial!) American families keep up appearances due to whatever their social standing in the community might be. In this film's case,an older son (Timothy Hutton) has been trying to keep on going in his teen years after the death of his younger brother in a boating accident. He returns home to the ""perfect"" family,Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland who present the idyllic upper middle class image. But there is something eerie and icy about this homelife that can only be seen from the inside. Everyone is affected by it, but no one can or is willing or is yet able to articulate what the problem is! Timothy Hutton seeks out a therapist (a deadpan,right-on clinician-type  Judd Hirsch) who is the catalyst through which Hutton's character comes to full enlightenment about the worthless emotions of misplaced guilt. This enlightenment threatens the very thread bare fabric of this family, and the sparks start to fly in ways that still have yet to be captured on film with such nuance and accuracy. Only the films THE HANGING GARDEN and THE ICE STORM have even remotely approached the power of ORDINARY PEOPLE. This story is unparalleled IMO in the world of family dynamics. That this film was Movie of the Year still stands as a testament to the resilient direction and acting in this film... with no special effects,no car chases, no CGI...but rather the cream of the crop actors demonstrating their fine-honed craft and a then-young director with a vision to tell a story about ordinary people.

I will say that I think Mary Tyler Moore's portrayal of the fragile ice queen Beth is excellent.  Donald Sutherland gives an excellent performance as the sensitive and emotionally generous Calvin.  Many have speculated that Beth doesn't love her son Conrad.  I think she does love Conrad in her own way.  After Buck's death (as Calvin so eloquently states at one point in the film) Beth has built an emotional wall which is the only way she can cope with her profound sense of loss after her eldest son's death.  Another telling moment in the film is when Calvin tells Beth ""We would have been ok if there hadn't been any mess.""  ""You can't handle mess.""  This is the crux of the movie.  How we all, in our own ways cope with mess.  Some of us tackle it head on.  Some of us choose to exit life at our own hands, and others choose to close themselves off emotionally because the pain is just to great.",1185494400,4,1057,4.309644670050761

Mary Tyler Moore steals the film as the cold hearted mother who blames her son for her other son's death. What makes the film so excellent is how Mary Tyler Moore pulls off the acting job of a lifetime. I never knew she could play a bitch and she makes it look so believable. The scene when she comes homes and confronts her son after learning he quit the swim team is provocative, and you can see the look of anger in her eyes. The best scene in the film. Timothy Hutton is excellent as the son and he desevedly won the Oscar. Without a doubt an excellent film and one that had ""Best Picture"" written all over it. It even beat ""Raging Bull"" that year. Sit back and enjoy one of the most dramatic films ever made even if it is 27 years old. Wonderful art never goes out of style. I will also never look at Mary Tyler Moore the same way again.

261001,4,6300216977,We've worn out our VHS copy and this movie continues to be a favorite for use in family studies classes at our university.

261002,4,6300216977,"Movie critic Pauline Kael assesses, ""The joker about this movie is that part of the audience weeps for the unloving WASP-witch mother.""  Well...this is my dilemma too.  I know that I'm supposed to feel sorry for Conrad, but Mary Tyler Moore's performance is so poignantly precise that I find myself feeling her pain each step of the way.

One reviewer wrote that fifty people would give you fifty different answers about what this film is about.  So true.  And one answer is that it is about what losing a child does to a mother.  In the abstract, we might say that we would never be like that as parents ourselves.  But in reality, many of us can see aspects of our own mothers in Beth.  We want to believe that the resources of love are unlimited, but following family tragedy, we find that people run out of sympathy when their own pain is too great.

There are some lines in the book (omitted from the movie) in which the psychiatrist counters Conrad's claim that he didn't try to off himself to hurt his mother--Weren't there also Valium pills in the bathroom cabinet, not just razor blades?  He made it as messy as he could.  There's a saying that a suicide kills two people.  That's what it's for (which is another whole aspect of this story).

Moore's performance is a double-edged sword:  She is believably demonstrative to the less needy son and aloof to the more vulnerable.  It is a highly personalized portrait:  You can SEE this in Moore's personality.  In real life, Moore is a diabetic.  And at times they need sugar to help them, and at other times sugar is poison.  So she herself has to regulate her ""sugar intake/metabolism"" so as not to become deathly ill.  (Her final scene is even tantamount to a diabetic seizure as she apparently tries to mouth the words ""I love you."")  In her autobiography, AFTER ALL, MTM writes of how she initially thought of her strict Catholic father when beginning to develop the character of Beth.  In hindsight, she can watch the film and see a part of herself.  (Her only son accidentally shot himself to death.)

The Pollyanna in me always hopes that Beth and Calvin are only temporarily separating.  But Beth wasn't willing to change her tightly controlled way of interacting, and the family unit apparently couldn't survive without a total upheaval.  Judith Guest (the author of the novel) has made it clear that Beth isn't coming back--in the book or the film.  The book even talks about Beth going to Europe for awhile after re-visiting her relatives in Texas.

Guest has also suggested in an interview that the ""exclusion"" of women in the end is a small point of contention.  In the novel, she explains, it is sort of like Beth is asked to leave.  In the film, it is more like she is being told to get out.  And this Out-with-the-Female feat is perhaps to the point of perplexity when we have the very actress who gave us Mary Richards, heroine of the Feminist Movement (small-screen version).  One can only imagine the level of sacrifice Beth has given over the years.  You will get an even stronger sense of this if you read the novel: Calvin spent time in an orphanage and Beth must have done a fair share of re-parenting of her own husband before she took on two sons:  one of whom is killed, the other of whom tries to end his own life.

The always acerbic TV critic Michael McWilliams surmises in his book TV SIRENS (A TANTALIZING LOOK AT PRIME TIME'S FABULOUS FEMALES):  ""Moore's performance in PEOPLE was scathingly exact, but it also endorsed the anti-feminist bias against her character.  Here was a wife and mother who kept a perfect home for twenty years, and what does she get in return?  Two weepy nerds in crewneck sweaters harassing her for not 'loving' them.  If the movie [had] any guts, it would [have] ended with the father and son trying to figure out how to work the washing machine.""  There's even a scene in the book in which the father and son discuss how they are going to manage such routine household chores now that Mom is gone.

This Exclusion of Mother is heartbreaking because one can truly see compassion toward Conrad lying beneath Beth's frosty front.  But there are so many barricades up.  The moment Buck's name is mentioned, she freezes like a deer caught in the headlights and can't get beyond.  There is a lovely illustration of this in the deck vignette (not in the novel), wherein Beth and Conrad exhibit the characteristics of two animals who, while affectionate toward each other, speak such different languages that they cannot communicate on even a basic level.

I didn't see Beth as a saint, but I still think the ending was heavy-handed.  I like to believe that, after a lengthy vacation, there's still a chance they'll become one big happy family.

TRIVIA QUESTION:
Q.  The film uses Buck's nickname throughout for the elder son.  I don't think they even once use his real name.  What was his real name?

261004,4,6300216977,"Ordinary People was released during the late 70's/early 80's emotional family themed era. These movies especially grappled with dysfunctional families and the pains associated with domestic strife. Ordinary People differed specifically because of solid acting from the leading actors/actresses to the stellar supporting cast. It also marked the debut of Robert Redford as a director.

The Jarrett's are your ""typical"" suburban family, but with a recent tragedy that has shaken the core of their structure. The eldest son, Buck was involved in an unfortunate accident that cost him his life. Marred with guilt from the accident, young Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) blames himself for the accident and attempts to take his own life. The movie centers on the bandage Conrad's mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) attempts to use to shield her family from sympathy and pity from the community. This defensive stance she takes unfortunately has created significant space between her and Conrad. It is Calvin Jarrett (Donald Sutherland) who is the man stuck in the middle of hostility between a dejected son and confused mother. Calvin's awakening towards the end of the movie proves to be the means of progress that the Jarrett's were in desperate need of.

The acting from the main characters was superb. Sutherland and Moore both complimented each other very well. Their intimacy was believable and their emotional scenes were intense. The newcomer Timothy Hutton steals the movie though as the troubled younger brother in desperate need of emotional support and guidance. Hutton's performance was emotionally charged with signs of maturity for an actor of his age. Judd Hirsch also steps up to the plate and provides some light comical relief as the psychiatrist grappling with first Conrad, then Calvin.

In 1980 many good movies came out, but Ordinary People took home the top honors. As debated this can be, what cannot be dismissed is the effectiveness and brilliance of this movie.",1161388800,13,1980,5.239747634069401
261005,5,6300216977,"'Ordinary People' is one of those films that everyone can appreciate.  Even if one has never been in this exact situation we have all still in one way or another felt the pain this family feels.  Regardless of whether you feel 'Ordinary People' to be the best film of 80 or the film that stole the crown you really can't escape the weight a film like this carries.  In the heartfelt and heartbreaking performances that seem almost too real we all can find a piece of ourselves and that's what makes this a brilliant film.

The film follows Beth and Calvin as they mourn the death of their eldest son Buck who died in a boating accident.  Their youngest son Conrad is almost left in the cold, feeling blamed for the death not by just his parents but by himself.  Because of this guilt, because of this pain he tries to end his life, and if it weren't for his fathers intervention he may have been successful.  The film shows the growing animosity Beth has for her son, almost as if she wished he had drown and not her dear Buck.  There's one scene in particular that really struck me, when Beth's parents were over and they wanted a picture of Conrad with his mother.  The tension in her voice as she pleaded with them not to take their picture, it's heartbreaking.

Mary Tyler Moore's performance to me was the standout, far cry from her sitcom days.  She showed every ounce of sincerity in what she was saying; how she was acting that an image of her tossing her hat into the air never once crossed my mind.  She became Beth.  Donald Sutherland is also a great actor, but his character being the quiet husband comes across background to the mother and the son which serve as the true body of the film.  Calvin is the heart, but the heart is rarely seen.  Timothy Hutton did brilliantly as Conrad, a boy so beat down by his guilt and so distraught over his mothers distaste for him that he can't function right.  Judd Hirsch plays the psychiatrist Conrad is sent to that befriends him and helps him come to grips with his real feelings.

Between Redford's amazing directing debut and Alvin Sargent wonderful adaptation of Judith Guest's novel of the same name you have a great movie waiting to happen, and when you add the powerful performances by everyone in the cast you get that great movie.

It affects me deeply each and every time I experience it.  ""Ordinary People"" is an acutely (painful and difficult to watch, at times you will find yourself feeling like a voyeur) intimate portrait of a family torn asunder by tragedy, yet fighting in the only ways they know to ease the pain and remain sane, ""Ordinary People"" is the iconic, masterfully directed and acted picture of the genre. Disarmingly charming in its ability to capture (and then fracture) our culture's tenuous ideas about family, love, compassion and grief, ""Ordinary People"" goads us to question at a very deep level our abiltiy to care and be cared for, to love and accept love, to feel and validate feelings for what they are to us, and those around us.  After many viewings, I remain in awe that my heart throbs during the desperate lows in this move, yet soars at the few moments of innocent discovery and hope depicted in joyous little moments between father and son, and teenagers groping for encouragement.  Some scenes are just withering: I cringe and cry at the photograph scene, I emotionally collaspe watching Beth try to physically recover from Conrad's embrace. I've come to believe that this movie is not about Beth Jarrett (Mary Tyler More, in her best performance ever, playing the emotionally undone mother with ferocity), nor about Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton, who won a supporting actor academy award for embodying the guilt-ridden surviving sibling of a horrific boating accident and the survivor of a suicide attempt), but about Calvin Jarrett (Donald Sutherland, in what is arguably the best and clearly overlooked performance of his career), the compassionate yet desperate father attempting to patch his family back together.  His attempts are beautifully naive and genuine, his pain is true and heart wrenching, his failure is life altering and enlightening. ""Ordinary People"" was Robert Redford's directorial debut--he should be proud, The movie reflects a keen emotional eye, a rare sense of cultural norms, a measured and compassionate grasp of what makes us human.  Some movies transcend time and circumstance--we overlook the dated clothes, long gone prejudices and antiquated behaviors because we see in its execution the larger, less time bound insights it offers the viewer.  This is one of those movies:  never a dull turn, a too slowly paced scene, a wasted use of the word in this movie. I give a copy of this movie as presents to the people I care for year after year. I give it knowing that their lives will change once they see this movie.  Please give this movie your best attention, you will never regret the choice.  This movie will become one of those moments you will wish to share with others. Judith Guest, the author of the book from which this movie was generated, should be proud that this movie is, I think, one of the few which do its original source justice.

""Ordinary People"" stars Mary Tyler Moore, Donald Sutherland, and Timothy Hutton as the Jarrett family. They had recently lost their older son Buck due to a tragic boating accident. The film focuses on the aftermath of Buck's death. Buck was the favorite son of Beth Jarrett (Mary Tyler Moore). After losing Buck, Beth finds it virtually impossible to show any kindness or affection to her younger son Conrad. In some way, she subconsciously blames Conrad for Buck's death. Donald Sutherland plays Calvin Jarrett, the father who tries to be there emotionally for his wife and son but does not know how to fix the huge gap between his wife and son.

Since he is unable to find solace in comfort in his family, Conrad finds comfort in his sympathetic psychiatrist Dr. Tyrone C. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Timothy Hutton's scenes with Judd Hirsch were heartbreaking to say the very least, especially when Conrad is forced to confront the boating accident. You'll understand why Timothy Hutton won an Oscar for his performance.

""Ordinary People"" did move a little slowly at times for me but overall the film was well crafted. The human dynamics between the members of the Jarrett family were realistic and emotionally moving. It was good seeing Mary Tyler Moore take on a role that wasn't as perky or idealistic as her famous tv character.

261021,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" is a great movie classic.  It develops the story beautifully with both subtley and directness through scenes that crescendo to a powerful climax and conclusion.  The acting is marvelous; the directing and editing are masterful; and the story (derived from a Judith Guest novel, worthy of reading separately before or after viewing the movie) is an emotional gold mine.

The story involves a respectable, but dysfunctional upper-middle class suburban Chicago family, the Jarretts, who are recovering from the aftermath of their eldest son's death.  Conrad (Timothy Hutton) recovered from the same boating accident that killed Buck, his brother.  He has to work out the results of that accident and still is surviving emotionally after the storm's wake, including a suicide attempt and a stay in a mental hospital.  Ordinary living has become nearly unbearable for him, but he has the support of a loving, but helpless father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) and a lack of support from a selfish and uncaring mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore).  Conrad finds himself adrift until he heeds his father's advice to seek help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Burger (Judd Hirsch).

""Ordinary People"" provides a symphonic build-up of emotions and revelations that are interesting and cathartic.  The performances are sensational.  Timothy Hutton justifiably won best supporting actor for the anguish, understated and boiling over, he created as Conrad.  Mary Tyler Moore has the performance of her lifetime, and Donald Sutherland, never nominated, shows ingenious subtlety as the father.  Judd Hirsch and M. Emmit Walsh are also excellent, as well as some of the natural performances by the other supporting actors.  Robert Redford has his directorial debut, which garnered him best director Oscar.

""Ordinary People"" is either loved or hated.  Some criticize the movie as mere melodrama, but it is so well crafted, it is hard to reconcile, except to say that you need to be reasonably sensitive to appreciate this movie and how it unfolds.  There is still resentment regarding their Oscar sweep of this movie.  ""Raging Bull,"" another Best Picture nominee, is another worthy classic, but a different sort of film.

261024,4,6300216977,"I came across this movie on Amazon.com one day, and wow, did the memories come pouring back....

It is the fall of 1980, in St. Louis, Missouri, the third year of medical school.  My friends and classmates have been scattered by our different clinical rotation assignments, divided up and swallowed whole into the innards of the WUMS hospitals.

On this day, by chance, I run into Cynthia again.  She is the America's Sweetheart of our class.  It has been some time since I last saw or talked with Cyn.  I had met her on the very first day of medical school, and had asked her to be in my gross anatomy lab group.  For an entire year, we had talked, and traded jibes and jokes, and shared in the black humor and friendship needed to keep our sanity while dissecting our cadaver, studying six hours a day, and living in the confines of Olin Hall.

I had a crush on Cyn, but so did half the male students in the class.  It turned out that we were very different, though, and we had gone our separate ways after the first year.

And so with this chance encounter, we talk again at length, as old comrades, sharing in the emotional exhaustion of our two and a quarter year journey.  We have become transformed, since that first day of medical school, from carefree, high-spirited college graduates, giddy at having arrived in medical school, into serious, dour professionals....molded to become responsible and diligent and conformist proto-doctors, our faces creased with the beginnings of worry lines.

Ordinary People is showing now, I mention casually to Cyn.  Do you want to go see it?  Yes! she says eagerly, and so off we go.  It is the only time I ever go out on a date with Cyn.

I remember now, Cyn, that you let me pay for your movie ticket. I remember that you cried during the scene when Conrad recounted what happened on the sailboat, at the climax of the film.  I remember I looked at you with sympathy, and you were a bit embarrassed and said, ""Thanks for not making fun of me"".

And that was the last time I remember talking to you at length, Cynthia.  Twenty months later, we would graduate, and two months after that I would get married.  And I have never seen you again.

But I heard, Cynthia, that you became a psychiatrist, like Dr. Berger in the movie, and probably you are one heck of a great psychiatrist....",1141948800,8,2329,4.484560570071259

With such material Redford bet for a so delicate and so hard theme that seems to be inspired in a Bergman film.

A familiar tragedy originates an absolute lack of emotional equilibrium around the members of a middle class family. His elder son has been awfully and touched by this significant loss and suffers serious deviations in his emotive behavior, blaming himself about it. Terrible revelations along the film will involve us from start to end. But there is still more, his mother is a human being unable to inspire love, transmit confidence and elicit human warmth. These emotive scarcities will surround his intimate and outer  world, creating an invisible but very defined frontier of self sufficiency isolating practically of all those who esteem and love her.

From the times of a Long day 's journey into the night, Guess who is coming to dinner, The last picture show and Kramer vs. Kramer we had not watched such kind of potent statement around a visible state of things that carved in relief with such crudeness and realism such familiar portrait.

Timothy Hutton got his best achievement in his career. But the honors also go to Mary Tyler Moore featuring the role of this obsessive and emotionally invalid mother; Donald Sutherland made a very vibrant acting as the wounded father who is stood in the middle of the tragedy. He represents the tolerance and the equilibrium trying to deal against the painful circumstances and making the best he can to avoid the unavoidable collapse

Robert Redford will be always remembered by his notable contribution to the enriching of the cinematographic language.

261043,5,6300216977,"This is one of the most honest and perceptive movies I have ever come across. It's painful and uncomfortable to watch some of the scenes because of its truthfullness. One scene that came to mind is the picture taking scene, isn't that just a sad scene. You're own mother not being able to even fake affection for his son. I know Mary Tyler Moore' character is not exactly a monster it's just she doesn't know how to connect with his son (in her words the other son that died whom she get along just fine doesn't need parenting). The screenplay allows the characters in the movie to be three dimensional, it made you feel that based on the conversations and dialogues they had that there could be people in real life in that situation.

Mary Tyler Moore gave a topnoth performance. She just understood the complexity of the role and she never made  a false move, from the big confrontation scenes to the quieter non-dialogue scenes. She was just consistently marvelous. The rest of the cast was great too. The underrated Donald Sutherland provided a good match for Moore. I love the dynamics between the two. Not to mention that they are very believable as a couple.

This is just a great movie. Great performances from the cast, a perceptive and moving screenplay and an intelligent direction from Redford. A satisfying movie that doesn't just make you think and feel, it makes you react and observe.

Ordinary People is a very emotional impacting film about the irrevocable damages that take place in Timothy Hutton's family when his brother died in a sailing accident. He's internally depressed and afflicted by this traumatic event. Both Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Southerland have not been able to face this harsh reality, and lived for years in silent grief. The three members of the family is no longer happy together, and they haven't moved on since the death of the boy. What can they do in order to let go and become a happy family again? Or can they still be happy together? I was very moved by the performances, especially from Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore.

And why? I knew immediately that it was because ""Raging Bull"" had lost.

I'm not deriding ""Raging Bull"" in any way-- it was a fine film, and the directing/acting was terrific... But I knew very well that depite ""Bull""s admitted quality, this room of gorillas were furious and indignant not because they really appreciated the artistry of that film, but they wanted a macho film with lots of scenes of guys beating the hell out of each other to win... Some movie-goers would also vote for ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Kill Bill"" over, say, ""Ordinary People"" for Best Picture as the latter has no graphic violence.

It's that simple, and that silly.

The suggestion that this win was one of the greatest travesties in Acadamy award history is--- well, it's just a buncha raging bull.

""Bull"" was good, but ""Ordinary People""s haunting (there's that word again), finely textured, understated view of a disintegrating middle-class family after the death with which none of them can deal of the in-house golden-boy, is the more affecting film. Some may claim the movie is now ""dated"" in that so many pictures have followed focusing on or dissecting middle class suburban life, but I've generally found those to be either too 80's-style-self-conscious, and/or too smug, and just quirkily unconnected to reality (and please don't confuse ""Terms of Endearment"" nor ""American Beauty"" with ""Ordinary People""!)

""People"" succeeds through understatement and lack-of-pretense, and from the fact that it was filmed in a now-bygone era in which posturing and political correctness weren't required from the script or the participants.

261051,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" (1980) is one of those rare classic films that has lost none of its power and remains relevant and fresh nearly 25 years after its original release.  Robert Redford's film debut, based on the modern classic novel by Judith Guest, packs the same powerful emotional punch on the tenth viewing it does on its first.

The story is simple but deals with incredibly complex emotions that take its characters and the audience into some pretty dark places.  On first look, the Jarretts are an ordinary, upper-middle class family consisting of businessman father Calvin (Donald Sutherland), homemaker wife Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) and teenage son Conrad (Timothy Hutton).  But something is definitely wrong.  Conrad has trouble sleeping and has slash mark scars on his wrists.  Calvin seems overly concerned with his son's health, while Beth is obviously in serious denial about something.  Then there's the bedroom at the end of the hall that is filled with another, absent son's possessions--an older son named Buck, whom we gradually discover has recently died in a tragic accident in which Conrad had some part.  It's not until Conrad starts seeing a psychiatrist named Berger (Judd Hirsch) that the circumstances of the accident, and the fragile state of the Jarrett family's emotional health, starts to unravel.

""Ordinary People"" is a perfect movie.  Not one scene, line of dialog, characterization or camera shot is out of place, wasted or unnecessary.  Redford directs with the sure hand of an old pro, and screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who recently wrote the superior script to ""Spiderman 2"") has accomplished something unthinkable:  he's actually written a script that improves on the original novel, which is pitch-perfect in its own right.  And the performances are phenomenal:  Hutton won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant turn as a suicidal teen simply crying out for his mother's love, while Moore deserved one (but lost out to Sissy Spacek's equally deserving work in ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") as a mother who buried her heart with her favorite son and cannot bring herself to give her surviving son the love he needs.  And Hirsch is a tower of strength as the understanding psychiatrist who forces Conrad to unlock the keys to his memory and understand why he has lost the will to live.  But the truly unsung hero is Sutherland, in an atypical role as a loving father who is supremely concerned about his son but simply can't crack through the surface of either wife or son to get to the root of the problem.  M. Emmett Walsh (as a swimming instructor), Frederic Lehne (as a concerned friend) and Elizabeth McGovern (as Conrad's potential girlfriend) add key support, while Dinah Manoff is simply a knockout in her one scene as Conrad's obviously unstable mental patient friend.

But the real genius of the film is in the casting of Mary Tyler Moore as the coldest, and most hated, mother since Angela Lansbury in ""The Manchurian Candidate.""  That Redford saw this character in the actress who previously was best known as the bubbly heroine of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" has to rank as one of the riskiest, and ultimately most insightful, casting decisions in cinema history.  Mark my word, in a film filled with haunting imagery, you will never forget Moore's last scene, in which she pathetically struggles to maintain her composure when she realizes her whole world has come crashing down on her.

""Ordinary People"" won the 1980 Best Picture Oscar, as well as awards for Hutton, Redford's direction and Sargeant's script.  Critics have maligned the choice for over two decades because it beat out Martin Scorsese's masterwork ""Raging Bull,"" which is admittedly an outstanding film.  Maybe this really is one of the all-time Oscar tragedies like many say.  But one thing is for sure.  ""Ordinary People"" is the rare film that has the power to not only change lives, but save them, too, if people take its message to heart.  ""Raging Bull"" is simply a vivid biopic of a heinous man.  I'll take the former any day.

***** (out of *****), although the DVD is a typical bare-bones, extras-free (except for the original trailer and 1:85:1 widescreen format) Paramount package.  Next year is the 25th anniversary, so here's hoping Paramount DVD opens the pursestrings and presents the extras and cast commentary this classic film deserves.",1094169600,14,4374,5.011065006915629

Isn't it amazing that this was his first feature film...really a troubled youth performance that will go down in film history (And it really doesn't hurt the guy that he's gorgeous.)

261053,5,6300216977,"Well, this film is easily one of the best I've ever seen.  I saw it for the first time around 1981.  It was odd, since i was watching with my own dysfunctional family when I was about 14.  It's a film that moves you every time you watch it and you can take away something different each time.  This is the mark of superb writing, acting and directing.  I can't believe that this was Redford's first attempt at directing.  It boggles the mind.  Just the natural scenes of suburban Chicago alone are well-done.
  Although Mary Tyler Moore, Sutherland and Hirch do fantastic jobs as Conrad's parents and psychiatrist, trying to get inside his head, it was Hutton's performance as Conrad that moved me  most.  He portrays the son left behind by a brother who died in a boating accident.  When the movie begins, Conrad has just returned to ""normal"" after being in the hospital for months due to a suicide attempt.  It is ironic that the title is ""ordinary"" people as this family is far from ordinary.  But Hutton's performance, with both emotionality and such a sense of emptiness is one of the most vivid performances I've ever seen.  What ever happened to Tim Hutton anyway ?
  Mary Tyler Moore's performance of the cold Beth, who seems to still blame Conrad on her favorite son Buck's death, is impeccable.  It really makes sense that you could get performances out of her and Tim Hutton of this caliber since both just lost a relative (she her son and Hutton his father) right before filming.  Donald Sutherland really portrays the kind of father everyone wants, let's just admit it.  He cares very much about his son !  To the point that he would visit his shrink to learn more about what he's going through.  Excellent performance and I still don't know why he wasn't nominated.
  I could write a short book about this film.  Suffice it to say that everyone should see it, despite whether you view your family of origin as dysfunctional or not.  We can all relate to certain themes:  hiding feelings, being afraid to face pain, facing pain and not knowing what to do with it, loss of friendship, loss of love, ""walking on eggshells"" in your own home.

How does a family deal with the loss of a well-loved son from an accident?  Some will shut out their emotions like Tyler-Moore's character, while the son needs to show his emotions, and needs his mother more than ever.  However, she is cold towards him, almost blaming him for the death of his brother.  Sutherland is the husband and father caught in the middle of it all, who is also trying to deal with his own emotions over the death of his eldest son.

261067,5,6300216977,"I recently watched this movie for the first time, and I was emotionally on edge for the entire two hours. Rarely does a film surface that so brilliantly tackles repressed human emotion and family tension. The film is very character-driven, especially the roles of Timothy Hutton and Mary Tyler Moore. Hutton plays Conrad, the tormented, suicidal younger son who survived the boating accident that killed his older brother, Buck. Moore is Beth, the icy, anguished mother who cannot forgive her younger son for surviving when Buck, her favorite, perished. Donald Sutherland is Calvin, the father who desperately tries to reconcile his wife and son and promote healing in the family. Judd Hirsch plays Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who helps Conrad come to terms with his parents, himself, and his dead brother. Most of the movie is viewed through Hutton's eyes, but we see each character try to cope with Buck's untimely and tragic death. I liked the fact that we discover the details about the accident in flashback pieces throughout the movie; it adds an element of suspense to the psychological study of the characters.
Several scenes are especially moving and are permanently affixed to my memory: the photo-taking scene with the grandparents; the restaurant scene with Conrad and Karen; Conrad's first session with Dr. Berger; Conrad's breakthrough session with Dr. Berger; the scene where Conrad catches his mother reminiscing in Buck's room, and the two can't even carry on a conversation together; the scene when Moore finally loses her rigid self-control; and of course the final scene. Watch each of these scenes and you actually FEEL what each character feels. It's incredible; a testament to brilliant acting, writing, and directing.
I believe that each of us can identify with some element of the tragic, dysfunctional family presented here, and perhaps that makes this film so timeless and exceptional. This movie isn't over-the-top (even though the social class of the Jarretts isn't exactly ""ordinary""). The film is impeccable. And here is what allows us to identify with this film, whether we've tragically lost a close family member or not: we all wish we were ""ordinary people,"" but like these characters, we all have deeper emotions and tragedies that threaten to break us.",1082937600,6,2290,5.158602150537634

261069,5,6300216977,"For anyone who hasn't seen ""Ordinary People,"" you really should see it right away.  I first watched it as a huge fan of Mary Tyler Moore.  What I saw, I never expected.  Mary Tyler Moore breaks her comedic, enduring style to play a hauntingly distant mother.  The move is absolutely brilliant.  At first, I was angered, throwing pillows at the television in seeing my hero play a character who baffled me so.  Then, from my love for her, grew a profound admiration for her talent.  No role or portrayal has ever affected me in the same way.  Adding to MTM's sheer brilliance, is the amazing performances turned in by Donald Sutherland and Timothy Hutton.  Donald Sutherland, who is able to steel a movie with small roles, stays in the background of attention in this film.  Yet, at the same time, his portrayal of the pathetic father, trying to hold his family together, is amazing and overlooked.  Timothy Hutton is very much deserving of the Oscar he won for his performance, although it should have been a best actor as opposed to best supporting actor.  As the depressed son, trying to find his place back in society, Hutton displays his talent at drawing us into a character and trying to understand what he is going through.  Judd Hirsch, plays his psychiatrist, and is equally amazing.  It is a far better portrait of a psychatrist than Good Will Hunting ever thought of portraying.  He is the psychiatrist anyone would want to go to in times of trouble.
This picture is the best dramatic film of all time.  While the ordinary is the upper middle class ordinary, it is like any family dealing with loss.  Mary Tyler Moore gives us the greatest display of acting since Katharine Hepburn took the screen.  As strong as Sissy Spacek's performance in Coal Miner's Daughter was, it does not compare to the profound and deep portrayal Mary Tyler Moore weaves us in.  Robert Redford excercised brilliant casting for his Directorial Debut.  He further enhances his brilliance with the style and score of the film.

Sutherland is great as the father (as always), Hutton is great as the traumatized surviving son, Mary Tyler Moore delivers an incredible (and personally significant) performance as the mother, and Hirsch is outstanding as the therapist who is helping Hutton's character put his life back together after a suicide attempt in the wake (no pun intended) of a boating accident that claimed the life of his older, much adored, brother.
The film shows the progression of emotional conflicts, trials and triblulations as these three people try and make sense of life afer an untimely death. The story is primarily told through Hutton's character.
It is a highly cathartic and moving film, particularly if you have ever lost a loved one to an accident. The scenes with Hutton and Hirsch are especially intense, as is the scene where Moore finally loses her extreme self control. Mary Tyler Moore is just amazing in that scene.

All of the individual performances are superb, especially Moore, Hutton and Hirsch.  At times I fear the performances are too remote, too distant.  We get only glimpses of how things ""used to be"" in the Jarrett household.  I didn't find Beth and Connie's relationship as heartbreaking as I should have simply because I had little context for it or ability to compare it with life before Buck's death.  The distance now overwhelms any since of what has been lost.
The film is truly frozen in the moment of their individual griefs.  These individuals move through their own journies of grief drawing closer and pulling back.
I hate to suggest making a film longer, as doing so usually makes it more ponderous.  However, if we had been allowed to linger just a bit more in some of the flashbacks, I think the emotional impact would have been that much greater.  So much unfolds in retrospect, and THAT is not like real life.  For instance, we do not know until very late in the film that Lazenby, Buck and Connie were ""best friends.""  I found it a very emotional scene, but it informs backward into the film a fact that all of the characters already know.
Certainly this film was ground-breaking, opening the way for some of the powerful family therapy-dramas that have followed.  Kudos to Redford and to a uniquely powerful cast. ****1/2",1076889600,9,1551,4.624087591240876

I chanced upon this this film without knowing anything about it, except that it was Robert Redfords directorial debut, and was truly surprised!
The narrative is remarkably credible and smooth. The writing is superb, there is not one moment in this film that feels false or ""acted."" The dialogue is extremely well written, but Redford, like Clint Eastwood or Kunrick, was not afraid to exploit moments of silence as well.
I cannot believe that Donald Sutherland wasn't even nominated for a supporting cast role, he leaves a taste of his presence long after the credits have rolled. Mary Tyler Moore was very successful in potraying the odious mother who cannot even feel her own despair after her favorite son's death in a boat accident. But hats off to the pivot of the movie, the younger brother who survived the accident, played flawlessly by Tim Hutton! I guess a performance that is also quite easily overlooked is that of Judd Hirsch, in a seemingly background but very important role of the younger son's psychiatrist.
Somewhat atypical of Hollywood, there are no happy endings and chiming bells to ""Ordinary People."" This is a deep, dark movie that journeys into the worst, most difficult situation a family must ever face, and comes out with a very natural resolution (of sorts.)
A must-watch treat!",1069459200,20,1480,4.924
261076,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary Peole"" deservingly won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1980.  It desplicts realities of those in such living turmoil.  It proves that such awful feelings toward oneself can strike those with the seemingly perfect life.  It explores the after-effects of a family once they lose a child, and once the other attempts suicide.  Robert Redford makes his Oscar winning directorial debut, leading the cast and crew to create a flawless, unforgettable masterpiece.
Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore(Calvin and Beth Jerrad) play the lead roles as the supporting father and the selfish non-loving mother.  Their marriage is on the verge of divorce due to Beth's lack of support of their living son Conrad, played by Timothy Hutton.  Conrad faces guilt after losing his brother, Buck, in a boating accident a year ago.  His psychologist forces him to confront every life aspect.
Every actor portrays their character delightfully, forcing every drop of emotion to the audience, even those with limited screentime.  Timothy Hutton deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.  Mary Tyler Moore and Judd Hirsch deserved their Oscar nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor.  Why wasn't Donald Sutherland nominated for his best role of his career?  Who knows.
Those looking for a serious drama should watch ""Ordinary People"".  One may have to think about the events after the first watch.  Those who've watched it twenty times still discover new interesting details.",1060300800,3,1483,5.259574468085106

In the middle of the movie, the teenager felt somewhat solemn for short periods of time but his choir school helped him with most of the deep struggling relief of his psychological pain. In many sessions, he went to visit his psychiatrist alone who works extremely hard in evaluating his current knowledgeable status that sometimes affect his ability to perform well academically in school. Until the solution has finally resolved, his painful emotions were superbly cured, a part to his final suicide attempt.
In particular, it was so tough for the young man to relate to his parents during the painful, perilous time. In this situation, his mind acts like the storm rages in his brain and the hormones do actually go nuts too. Therefore, at the end of the film, it was their decision for his parents to seperate prior to the adolescent wanting to be completely joyful again.

261078,5,6300216977,"I saw this movie on the big screen when it was released in 1980 - I was just 14 years old.  Timothy Hutton was a newcomer, but I had grown up watching, and adoring Mary Tyler-Moore on TV on her show, and reruns of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".  It was somewhat startling to see her in this role of the icy-cold Beth Jarrett, but after a few moments on-screen one forgets completely that we're watching ""Mare!"" and she instantly becomes this character.
I can't say enough about this movie - it has always been one of my top five favorite all-time films.
Robert Redford (who won a Best Director Oscar) did a superb job casting and directing it.  Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but can anyone imagine other actors in the roles of ""Conrad"" (Timothy Hutton - who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), ""Calvin"" (incredibly, heart-breakingly-portrayed by Donald Sutherland)and of course ""Beth""?  Who other than Judd Hirsch can you imagine bringing such tenderness, caring and compassion to the character of Conrad's psychiatrist, ""Dr. Berger""?
As another reviewer stated so succinctly, there are so many layers to this film, you literally can't blink, or you'll miss something.  In fact, 23 years later, having watched it maybe fifty times, I still have a new realization in every viewing.
I've also read the book, and while it was a wonderful book, the movie is far and away more emotional.
Be prepared; this is not a ""feel-good"" movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It is thought-provoking, tragic, emotional and gut-wrenching, and it might make you re-evaluate aspects of your life. The subject-content (accidental death, severe depression, suicide) is very serious and can be upsetting or even depressing.
This film also won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1980. I must add that no matter how incredible the entire cast, Timothy Hutton is the STAR of this film, and the Oscar he won, though well-earned, should have been for Best Actor.  Whomever thinks that the role of Conrad was a supporting one, needs to re-evaluate that opinion.
If you're considering purchasing this movie, do not consider further - just order it.  It's one of those ""must-have"" for your collection.

261081,3,6300216977,"1980's Ordinary People was superstar Robert Redford's directorial debut.  The film centers around an upper class Midwestern family, The Jarretts, whose lives are shattered when the oldest son of two is killed in a boating accident.  As the want of many families when tragedies strike, they bottle their feelings up and try to pretend if they don't talk about what happened, the pain will go away.  The younger son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), was apart of the boating accident and he feels that it was his fault.  He can no longer stand the guilt and pain and tries to commit suicide.  Conrad then starts seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), and he starts facing his true feelings and the deep seated denial that exists in his dysfunctional family.  Conrad's parents, Calvin & Beth (Donald Sutherland & Mary Tyler Moore), have their own struggles as Beth refuses to show any emotion towards Calvin and the death of their son.  Cal desperately tries to hold his broken family together, but the pressure starts to weigh too heavily on him.  The film is full of excellent performances.  Ms. Moore plays totally against her normally upbeat personality by making Beth into the ultimate ice queen.  Mr. Hirsch is very good and Mr. Hutton won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.  But the unsung hero is Mr. Sutherland, who is not only the glue who is trying to hold his family together, but the is backbone of the film.  Mr. Redford does a fine job in his directing debut and he won his only Oscar for Best Director.  The film also won Best Picture, but despite all the accolades, it is just a very good film, not a great one.  It plays a little too heavily on the melodramatic and tends to be overly depressing in places.  The film beat out what is considered by many to best film of the 1980's, Raging Bull, for best picture and Mr. Redford beat out Raging Bull's director, Martin Scorcese, in the directing category.",1041897600,7,1931,4.671597633136095
261082,4,6300216977,"This Best Picture of 1980 is an extraordinary and searing experience as we see one family in crisis falling apart at the seams. ""Ordinary People"" takes us into an upper middle class family where the older of its two sons has died in a drowning accident with the survivors left to deal with the emotional devastation. As family matriach Beth Jarrett, Mary Tyler Moore earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination and plays her character with what, at first, may come off as emotional distance and viciousness when, actually, she is essentially a weak person unable to handle anything less than perfection. As surviving son Conrad, Tim Hutton was a Best Supporting Actor statue for his protrayal of the emotionally shattered little brother dealing with his own guilt for having lived and his fight to be accepted by his mother. And as family man Cal Jarrett, Donald Sutherland is powerfully moving as the father who sees but cannot fend off the disintegration of his family. Robert Redford, in his directoral debut, won a Best Director Oscar, and justly so. Not an easy film to watch, ""Ordinary People"" nonetheless is an important lesson in the need for honesty and, in the end, doesn't cheat us with a happily-ever-after resolution.

261083,5,6300216977,"I saw this film again after almost 20 years, and was again riveted by its artistry and integrity. Robert Redford's directoial debut was most acute, with generous close-ups, and a profound respect for the script. Timothy Hutton is the center of this film, and the completeness of his incredible performance can make no one doubt why he won the Oscar (Supporting?). I won't rehash the plot because everyone else has done that. But there's the performance of Mary Tyler Moore, shedding her good girl image and playing a selfish control-freak mother with virtually no emotion. She's incapable of saying ""I Love You"" to anyone in her life, including herself. It's a classic performance, adding to her already respectable body of work. Judd Hirsch was pivotal to the goings-on as the shrink (also Oscar nominated), and Elizabeth McGovern was excellent in one of her first roles as Hutton's puppy-love (she was nominated the following year for ""Ragtime""). In a small but pivotal role, Dinah Manoff shines as the only person Hutton felt he could talk to, but ultimately, couldn't. Though this won most of the major Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supp. Actor), the Academy should hang their heads in shame for ignoring the outstanding performance of Donald Sutherland. It was a subdued, centered performance that eventually made everything make sense. His final scene (with Moore) was so very sincere, and the closing scene (with Hutton), where they both said ""I Love You"" to each other, made everything seem all right. Even if he was nominated, it's hard to say if he could've beaten DeNiro in ""Raging Bull"". (I'm disappointed that Hutton's and McGovern's careers weren't greater.) Have tissues handy, and experience this wonderful display by Redford that made this dysfunctional family so compelling.",1039737600,5,1801,5.171232876712328
261084,5,6300216977,"I have seen ""Ordinary People"" at least a dozen times over the past 17 years. I was 15 when I first saw it. It is one of a small handful of films that I have turned back to over the years as I've grown for new insight and meaning with profound results (others include ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Taxi Driver""). Each and every time I see this, I see something new and am still deeply affected.
People and critics throw out the phrase ""works on so many levels"".  This is an ideal film to model that nebulous concept. You could ask 50 people to screen it and ask them what they think it is about, and you would get 50 different responses. You could ask those same 50 people to screen it again in 5 years, and then ask them what they think it's about. You would get 50 different responses again. And so on and so on. You would get ""it's about suicide"", ""it's about [someone] that dies"", ""it's about a family tragedy"", ""it's about teen depression"", ""it's about a cold mother"", ""it's about a dysfunctional family"", and on and on. These are all true (and then some) so it's nearly impossible to describe this film in a nutshell.
""Ordinary People"" (the movie and the great book from which it was adapted) shows us how families can go on for years and years (and even generations) without ever realizing or having to assess how everyone feels about one another. Some families get away with it, for things run smoothly on the surface. But sometimes things happen to shatter that facade. Could be an illness, a drug problem, a divorce, a death, whatever. Sometimes something so terrible happens that a family is forced to face each other and speak the unspoken. But sometimes, the unspoken simply cannot be spoken, at least by some of the members.
That is the case with this family. The mother is so empty and emotionally sterile that it is clear she had never been a true part of that family. At least outside of her first child. ...The father struggled with his feelings, and wanted to share them, but probably felt unable to with such a cold, heartless matriarch in the family. And the... son didn't know what... he wanted, and was caught somewhere between his mother's sterility and his father's earnestness. He was always trying to please both, never realizing that it would never happen with his mother. At least until [something happened], for which the guilt mounted and mounted (with little help from his parents to relieve).
Watching these three characters (well, two, really, for the mother is emotionally arrested) cope with this tragedy and assess their positions in the family unit is so compelling and so wrenching that it's almost voyeuristic. Robert Redford's direction really does feel like we're peeking into the windows of a family that we ""know"" down the block. Little did we know (or did they) what was really going on.
This is a somber movie; it is not a simple TV movie-of-the-week. It shows that serious pain must be endured before pleasure can be found/regained. You can't sweep anything under the rug. And honesty is a must in any family or relationship; communication is vital to its survival. There's no way around it. Sometimes the communication will lead you to the worst conclusion--that you simply cannot get along--but the truth always prevails.  Because only in truth can you even try to change/understand/improve things.
Technically speaking, this is superbly crafted. The acting is brilliant, the direction is penetrating, the dialogue ranges from exuberant to shattering, and everything else is perfect. I've seen a lot of movies, and it still amazes me that one of the most grueling, heart-wrenching pieces of acting I have ever seen was by young Timothy Hutton. The sight of his face and the sound of his voice will tear you apart. To me, that young actor carried the bulk of this heavyweight picture. He is nothing short of brilliant here. Donald Sutherland, definitely a great actor, hasn't been any better than this. To me, he is the ultimate portrait of the honest man struggling with his confusing role as a father and husband. And Mary Tyler Moore, of course, is frighteningly intense as the mother; it's impossible to link this woman to Mary Richards. Great support from everyone else, including the wonderful Elizabeth McGovern (with a character that receives much more development in the novel), and Judd Hirsch as the boy's psychiatrist (their scenese together are brilliant).
I can't stress this film's importance enough. It demands multiple viewings. It is a shining example of how much insight film (and art in general) can shed on our lives if handled with care, taste, and realism. It covers ground that is universal to us all, regardless of family background. Don't cheat yourself out of a profoundly moving experience. And it just might change your life.

A family dealing (each in their own way) with the boating accident and death of their teenage son. The younger son blaming himself,suicidal and going through therapy.  A father who isn't sure if he is still in love with his wife.  A mother who goes through the motions, immaculate, perfectly made up, dying inside. A mother who cannot bare to hug or take a picture with her living son.

Donald Sutherland plays his father with compassion and understanding.  Mary Tyler Moore is cast as the mother in a very unsympathetic role.  She can't seem to love this second son of hers, and doesn't even seem to try.  There is always a false smile on her face as she presents a picture of the perfect wife and mother to the world.  There's a coldness inside that just can't be reached.  She was so natural in this role that it seemed she is like this in real life.  But I guess that is what good acting is all about.  Judd Hirsh is cast as an understanding psychiatrist who helps the boy as well as the father.
Robert Redford does an admirable job of directing this film.  He brings out outstanding performances from all involved and makes sure that the cinematography is used to enhance rather than get in the way of the story.  The film belongs to the screenwriter and the actors who get to show off their immense talents.

261089,5,6300216977,"""Ordinary People"" has got to be one of the most moving films I've seen in quite a while.  I have to say, some of the issues and events depicted here struck uncomfortably close to home for me.
This was actor Robert Redford's directorial debut, and it won the 1980 Oscar for Best Picture.  It tells the story of an upper-class family living in a quiet country town.  The family of three are trying to come to terms with the accidental death of their older son in a boating accident.
The main focus of the film is on the guilt stricken younger son, Conrad, very well played by Timothy Hutton.  Conrad has spent several months in a mental institution after attempting suicide.  Now he must try to pick up the pieces and go back to school.  Unfortunately, things aren't that easy.  Conrad finds it difficult to fit in with his roudy and obnoxious friends, and many people are now avoiding him.  Conrad's swim coach  regards Conrad with a mixture of fascination and disgust.  To make matters worse, his mother seems to hold Conrad responsible for his brother's death, causing a lot of tension at home.  An emerging relationship with the girl at school seems to be the only bright spot in Conrad's life.
Donald Sutherland is effective as Calvin, Conrad's well meaning father.  Calvin wants to help Conrad, but doesn't seem to know exactly how.  Calvin's a nice, essentially non-confrontational man who tries to act as the peacekeeper of the family.
Mary Tyler Moore is also very good as Conrad's mother, Beth.  On the surface Beth is your picture-perfect mother and wife.  Yet there's something off, even selfish about Beth.  As we learn, she openly preferred Conrad's older brother Buck who was better at everything.  Now that Buck is gone, Beth allows her hostility towards Conrad to come to the surface.  Besides blaming Conrad for Buck's death, she despises him for attempting suicide, which, as she sees it, ruined her reputation in the community as the perfect mother.  Beth will never forgive Conrad for doing this to her, and Conrad's father doesn't want to face up to Beth's essentially cold nature.
The somewhat weaker part of the movie for me was Conrad's sessions with Dr. Berger.  Dr. Berger uses psychoanalysis to help Conrad deal with the root of his guilt.  I'm not very big on psychoanalysis as I think much of it is outdated, based on the now debunked methods of Dr. Sigmund Freud.  Nevertheless, while these scenes don't add much to the movie, neither do they detract.
I've wondered a lot about why Beth is so hostile towards Conrad.  Well, maybe it's because she senses, correctly, that Conrad sees past Beth's cheerful facade.  Beth despises Conrad for seeing the selfishness to her character that she has so effectively disguised from others.
The place the film is set is quite beautiful.  This is the kind of suburban town we'd all like to live in, with beautiful houses and lots of trees and shrubbery.
I liked the way the film wrapped up.  It shows how some people can confront their difficulties and character flaws, while some people cannot.  This seems quite true to me.
I'd highly recommend this film for anyone who likes moving dramas.",1031097600,,3158,4.767955801104972

261091,5,6300216977,"The subtle masterpiece and academy award winner for Best Picture of 1980, ""Ordinary People"", is Robert Redford's surprising directorial debut. Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising though, when recognizing how Redford's delicacy and quiet appeal on screen greatly reflects and triumphs in ""Ordinary People.""
This heart-wrenching, character-driven film, based on Judith Guest's novel, evolves around the lives of an upper-class suburban family in Chicago. The story centers on the troubled son's perspective, Conrad Jarrett (played astoundingly by Timothy Hutton), who is painfully struggling to assimilate into high school and home life after months in a mental institution for attempted suicide. His transition is awkward and difficult as desperate and agonizing efforts to connect with his heartbreakingly distant and broken mother, Beth, (played by Mary Tyler Moore) seem tragically hopeless.  His father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) tries hastily to assure his son, but is hindered with denial. Conrad's lonely quest is an endless search for belonging and normalcy at school and at home, which appears unachievable in the shadow of his recently dead older brother whom his mother deeply favored and his grave depression and self-conscience recovery. However, his helplessness is lessened as he begins to attend weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Berger, (Judd Hirsch) who slowly unlocks the boy's mysteries and inner torment.
""Ordinary People"" is carefully crafted and refreshingly raw, yet thoughtful study of an `ordinary' type of family falling apart at the seams. The plot may appear classic - the troubled upper-middle-class teenager who can't live up his parent's standards, set by another more favored child - and perhaps it is, certainly told more than once - as illustrated in great coming-of-age movies like ""Stand By Me."" However, this is an absolutely original endeavor - revolutionizing the `family drama.' For ""Ordinary People"" is truly about ordinary people, portraying the downward spiral of the Jarrett family with such honesty. Now, when you read the word honesty, you probably imagine people losing control and you probably imagine harsh reality - perhaps you are under the impression that ""Ordinary People"" is an `in your face' portrait of rampant emotion. And it is to some extent - except you, the observer, may not pick up on that. And that's what distinguishes this film from its peers. And that's why I'm going to let you, the intelligent viewer, decide what you can get from watching it, instead of pointing out to you what my interpretations are of the various themes.
The melancholy and subdued, yet suspenseful and heartrending approach is un-comparable and so well tackled by Redford. He certainly accomplished the task of gradually developing so many layers to each character without unrealistically shoving it down the audience's throats. And the ensemble cast each gave memorable performances, Timothy Hutton at times revealing more through body language than words, Mary Tyler Moore giving an un-characteristic, almost chilling portrayal, and Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch also incredibly engaging. So often, we as movie-goers begin to label certain characters on the huge cinema screen as like us, when in fact it is very rare that a film comes along in which the characters are so truly like us that it is almost as if one is experiencing rather than just watching. And fortunately, this is one of those very rare films and I STRONGLY recommend adding this powerful, touching story to your video collection! Because it is art like this that makes you realize that less really can be much, much more! And I will hint to you that the basic plot is only the simple surface of this intriguing story, so I beg you to buy it and discover all its exciting layers.",1025654400,4,3794,5.260726072607261

Donald Sutherland is spectacular and so is Mary Tyler Moore.  The whole cast is brilliant using Canon in D minor touches you while you watch this film.
This film deals with family lose and the different ways people cope and how it tears families apart.  Mary Tyler Moore character Beth refuses to forgive Conrad (Hutton)for the death of Buck (her favorite son)  You can tell in this how she really does hate Conrad and wished she had Buck instead how cold that is it and the truth. People just do not want to face it and that is what this movie really brings forth. Sutherland character worries and cares he tries to mend the family he does ""see"" what is happening to the family but is tyring to figure out what to do about it.  The only part that I did not like was when Conrad's best friend on the swim team starts to be mean to him and towards the end Conrad says it is too painful to be around him and his friend just tells him to get lost.  Then at the same time it shows how different poeple just cannot handle the tragedy and instead of trying harder he just lets him go.  The scene where it all comes out on what happened to Buck is the hardest part to watch.  Again Dr. Berger is brillant!  A must see movie.  The whole main cast should of gotten Oscars.  Still 20 years later it effects people it is timeless.",1020556800,2,1837,4.229226361031519
261094,5,6300216977,"In his directing debut Robert Redford hits a home run with this story of a family on the edge. Timothy Hutton plays Conrad 'Con' Jarrett a young high school student who's trying to cope with the death of his brother in a boating accident. After an attempted suicide he is hospitalized and the movie picks up a few months after he's been home. Donald Sutherland plays Calvin Jarrett and Mary Tyler Moore (in an amazing proformance not just by a comedic actor but any actor)is Beth Jarrett. Sutherland is trying very hard to help his son but at times seems only to try not to push him too hard. Moore is still morning the death of her son Jordan 'Buck' Jarrett in the accident and seems to both blame Conrad and is afriad of him at the same time. Judd Hirsch plays Dr. Berger who Hutton see's to help him cope. The supporting cast is very solid like Adam Baldwin,M Emmet Walsh, and Elizabeth Magovern, but he movie belongs to the four main actors and as well it should. This is a heartbreaking movie about loss.coping, and love. Redford pulls out all the stops in this dramatic masterpiece. This is human intrest at it's best and all areas of the typical American family is seen. In the end the movie is about just what the title suggest's Ordinary People like any other on the surface but under the face's there are problems. The work of all the actors is just superb. Hutton won and Oscar for the role and both Hirsch and Moore were nominated. The movies biggest surprise comes from Moore. Best know for her work on the Mary Tyler Moore show and known mostly for her comedy is a real gem in this movie as the cold and distant wife and mother. You will never see a better movie about denial and the Amercian family or just plain Ordinary People.",1017532800,,1744,4.419254658385094

Her depiction of the mother of a family was so credible that you were iron filings and the picture was a strong magnet.  After seeing MTM do so well in comedic roles, seeing her do so well in a strong dramatic role demonstrated how versitile and powerful an actress she is.  She depicted a Mother whose main goals revolve around the mother's three strongest goals: status, status and status.  This is why I hated her....she was so credible !!!

Watching it makes you realize Redford's passion for Independent films(and why he started Sundance)and why they are so much better than what hollywood usually has to offer.  This film takes it's times to unfold and lets you get to know the characters and WHAT a payoff.  This is explosive stuff and you won't soon forget, hell you won't be able to shake Mary Tyler Moore's actions off your own mind for a while.  One Problem,  this DVD has no special features and for me that is what DVD is for.  A making of would be excellent and a commentary, for inspiration Redford could look at DePalma's recent foray into DVD with his excellent ""Special Editions"" for both Carrie and the also underrated Dressed To Kill films.

261107,5,6300216977,"This movie profoundly affected me when I first saw it 20 years ago, and watching it today its impact remains undiminished.
In the wrong hands, this could so easily have become yet another dreary family drama in the TV Movie of the Week tradition, but first-time director Robert Redford skillfully avoids all the cliches. His restrained direction ensures that the movie never descends into melodrama, and the big moments are superbly realised without the use of soaring strings or other Hollywood devices. Consequently, there is not a single moment that does not entirely ring true, and the movie is all the more heartwrenching for Redford's honest approach.
He is helped by a uniformly excellent cast. From all accounts, Redford is (as you might expect) an actor's director, and here he draws superb performances from two actors in atypical roles. Donald Sutherland is deeply moving in the difficult role of the father unable to comprehend why his family is falling apart, and Mary Tyler Moore is equally good as his emotionally repressed wife. The latter's performance is all the braver when one recalls that Tyler Moore's role mirrored her own off-screen turmoil at that time. For like the character of Beth in the movie, she too had recently lost a son, and was struggling to come to terms with her loss.
Judd Hirsch and Elizabeth McGovern are also impressive as, respectively, the psychiatrist and choirfriend who try to help Conrad, the troubled younger son of Tyler Moore and Sutherland. Conrad is played by 20-year-old Timothy Hutton in a mesmerising performance that will leave few viewers unaffected. Perfectly capturing the suicidal anguish of his character, Hutton rightly won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this pivotal role. (Though why he was not nominated for Best Actor is beyond me; his is, after all, the central performance in the movie). Given the degree of Hutton's talent, one can only look in dismay at the downward spiral of his career in recent years.
Ordinary People was one of the finest American movies of the 1980s, and its themes are as relevant today as they were two decades ago. I highly recommend this genuine classic.",1009670400,7,2159,4.983379501385041

I first saw this film about 4 years ago on the recommedation of my theater teacher, and fell in love with every single aspect of it. Aesthetically, it's so beautiful, with glimpses of gorgeous town and saturated with rich colors. I love the muted colors, the earth tones and grays and dark browns that surround Tomothy Hutton's cahracter, and how they contrast so sharply with the bright and crisp colors assigned to Mary Tyler Moore's Beth Jarrett. The strings of ""Canon in D Major"" are a perfect complement to the movie; it's the one piece of music repeated throughout the film. The writing is meticulous and intelligent, but never pretentious. It's also beautifully moving, without being melodramatic. The acting is magnificent. There's this one scene between Timothy Hutton and Elizabeth McGovern sitting in a restaurant that I love...I love the look of shock and empathy on her face after the camera reveals Hutton's healing wrists.

I was kind of skeptical about Redford (the 'gorgeous guy') as a director at first, but 10 minutes into this movie, those 'worries' flew far away.
This is simply a brilliant film that deals very honestly about a family (although 'Ordinary' still seems odd to me, as we all don't live in affluent Chicago suburbs!) that is trying desperately to deal with a family death, and all the denial and emotions that surround it.  Judd Hirsch is simply awesome as the psychiatrist that deals with the troubled Timothy Hutton, and they develop a very special relationship - one that ends up integrated with the father.  The breakdown of the relationship between Sutherland and Moore is heartbreaking, yet all very believable in the context.  It has me reaching for the hankies to this day!
Overall, this is still the BEST movie to date that I have ever seen that deals head-on with family tragedy, and does it with passion, class and honesty - not overblown drama and lots of songs and 'face shots' to cover up what the script could not deliver.  I cannot say enough positive things about this great movie - get it or see it if you have not already!",1008288000,,1293,4.461864406779661

261112,5,6300216977,"(... This movie) won a Best Picture Oscar, so I figured it would be good. I had no idea. Ordinary People is an astonishing movie where nothing is as it seems. The title itself is ironic, because although the Jared family seems like your typical American family, they are by no means so. Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth, the emotionally retentive mother who would rather not face the unseen demons that are rapidly tearing their family apart. Her performance captures the inner coldness and turmoil that is necessary to the character. Donald Sutherland is also excellent as Calvin, the sociable father who feels somewhat responsible for the problems of the family and wants healing. The regret and sadness of his character shine through, what an excellent job. Judd Hirsch is Dr. Berger, the psychiatrist who helps the family try to heal. But the movie is stolen by Timothy Hutton, who plays the young son Conrad, who had previously attempted suicide. His portrayal of the anguished, emotionally dead Conrad is a virtuoso performance. Eventually, through the help of Dr. Berger, Conrad is able to stop blaming himself for the death of his brother and move on with his life. Perhaps the most tension-filled scene in the movie for me was when Conrad found out that his friend had committed suicide and he goes into the bathroom and turns on the warm water and we see the scars on his wrists, and we can only wait to see if he is going to try it again. Another thing, brilliant direction by Robert Redford. Instead of using indulgent film shots or camera tricks, he just allows the camera to focus on the action, the right approach, even though he might have been tempted to try that kind of thing to prove himself in his first film. This is a great movie, one of the best ever made. Make it the next one you see. However, the DVD version is a little plain (...).",1006819200,43,1855,4.624242424242424

But look what happened in the end, Raging bull is the 20 in AFi top 100 films and Orinday People is far behind.",994636800,8,369,4.242857142857143
261114,5,6300216977,"The subtle masterpiece and Academy Award winner for best picture of 1980, ""Ordinary People"", is a heartbreaking, character driven tale that evolves around the lives of an upper class, suburban family in Chicago. The troubled son, Conrad Jared (played by Timothy Hutton), must make an awkward and difficult transition into high school and home life after months in a mental hospital for attempted suicide, greatly due to the loss of his older brother. He is still haunted by his past and desperately longs for a connection with his distant and broken mother, Beth (played by Mary Tyler Moore), as well as a sense of belonging and normalcy, which he searches for during his weekly interactions with his psychiatrist (played by Judd Hirsch), who slowly unlocks the boy's inner pain and mysteries. The concerned father, Calvin (played by Donald Sutherland) tries frantically to assure his son and piece the family back together; however the emotional struggles the family must endure brings out each member's true colors and weaknesses, including the fathers.
""Ordinary People"" is carefully crafted, incredibly honest, and touching. Each character is depicted with great depth and sincerity. Hutton delivered an intense, thoughtful and true performance, receiving a well-deserved Oscar for best supporting actor, although the title, best actor, would have been more suitable... the role was made for him, and he owned it with such care, often speaking more with his eyes and body language than words. Another highlight is Mary Tyler Moore, who tackled her first dramatic role amazingly, surprising audiences with her profound, Oscar worthy and most memorable portrayal. Hirsh (who was nominated for an Oscar for the film as well) and Hutton also had great chemistry together -playing off of each other very naturally - certainly a plus for fans of  ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""Good Will Hunting"", and Sutherland gave a notable performance as the lost, but hopeful father - which led him to an Oscar nomination.
The characters of this film are surprisingly real and easy to relate to, even the adult friends of Beth and Calvin, as well as Conrad's friends are so believable -making ""Ordinary People"" one of the greatest character studies of all time. What I really loved about this movie is that it gave nothing away - it trusted the audience to figure out what each character's motives were and what they were thinking, a refreshing change from the regular, Hollywood movie of today - in fact another aspect which made the film so refreshing was that unlike other family dramas it was very unpredictable. Watching ""Ordinary People"" is a very inexplicable experience, not relying on anything but truth to get its message and entertainment across - its almost like looking into a mirror... bravo to the writers and actors who depicted each character with such layers and candor, possibly paying more attention to detail then the creators of ""The Sixth Sense"" and other acclaimed mysteries. And not only that, but this movie leaves audiences with a new perspective and a lot to ponder.
This is Robert Redford's directorial debut and by far his greatest. The winner of four Oscars, ""Ordinary People"", is a classic that cannot be missed, proving once again that the average person is more interesting than a love triangle or action sequence! It is a breakthrough, flawless film that is true to reality, yet is well balanced with comedic relief, suspense and a little romance between Conrad and a girl from his high school. However, we view this relationship realistically and we feel the anxiousness and nervousness between the two without the glamour and lines that could only have been created by a screenwriter or James Bond. Although the movie may appear to be simple on it's exterior, accompanied by only one instrumental piece, Pachelbel's ""Canon in D"", it has many heavy layers that are thrilling to explore. I feel this film, among other things, is about humanity; what regular people are capable of doing to others out of fear.

Stodgy, square and reeking of respectability, it nevertheless has an undeniable emotional pull.  If you'll meet it half way, you can expect a good cry.  But it's crap just the same.
Aside from a few memorable performances (notably Judd Hirsh's affable shrink and Meg Mundy's subtle, hilarious turn as Mary Tyler Moore's dragon of a mother), the acting is almost uniformly bad -- obvious, self-conscious and ""Serious.""  (Worst is MTM, who gives a performance of surpassing obtuseness.) Timidity and solemnity inform every camera angle, prop, set decoration, line of dialogue.  Redford's idea of seriousness, of tastefulness, leeches the vitality out of everything he touches.  ""Ordinary People"" is so dreadfully tasteful that it achieves its own form of vulgarity.  (Marvin Hamlish did the score; the main theme is Pachelbel's Canon; it is SUNG during the opening titles.)
Redford records events as an outsider; he's a diligent, uninspired anthropologist:  his method is clinical, bloodless, but not especially observant.  He tells us little enough about these people, none of it new, but manages nonetheless to get it all wrong. Yes, of course, many ""nice"" upper-middle class families are emotionally crippled -- nobody would disagree that the price of gentility is a certain amount of emotional repression.  That's what good manners are all about.
As an outsider, Redford attempts to remain above the fray, but at the very end, succumbs to the disastrous urge to choose sides:  these aren't real people after all -- they're heroes and villains, just like in the movies.  His heroes, to be sure, have a few attractive warts to give them a becoming vulnerability, but his villains are entirely bad -- evil, dishonest, selfish, narrow-minded, callous, dangerously psychotic liars.

It's a film that uncovers the facade of middle-class America, and reveals the emotional distance and spiritual emptiness that plagues families who seem to have it all. What makes it work so brilliantly is the richness of the emotional nuance, there are countless moments within the film that resonate deeply with truth about the dynamics between husbands and their wives, parents and their children, it's virtually impossible not to connect with the story and the characters portrayed. Donald Sutherland and Timothy Hutton are both exceptional in their roles, but I was really surprised with Mary Tyler Moore's enormously affecting portrayal as a woman whose aloof facade is slowly starting to dissolve.

But all actors in this film do justice to the fine script, photography and direction.  Basically it tells the story of the devastating effects loss can have on  what to all appearances is a model middle class American family. Ms Moore's  meticulous dedication to her house duties, her obsession about place  settings at dinner for example, reminds one of the mother in the film THE  DAY AFTER who goes upstairs to make the bed when she realises the world is  coming to an end -literally. It's a powerful moment, because the viewer is  reminded of mothers as the givers, the nurturers, the builders of family,  the ones who seem at the centre of civilised life. Thus the tragedy in  ORDINARY PEOPLE to me turns very much on Ms Moore's role as the mother.  Because she cannot come to terms with loss, her falling, her failures -  loving too much perhaps, caring too much for one son over the other - is  the tragedy wrought on the family unit.

Donald Sutherland was also excellent as the  father who really wants to see his family kept together, and try to be  happy again after losing a loved one.

Oh, and don't forget the kleenex...cuz it jerks  those tears right out of you.",954460800,4,1419,4.731404958677686
261131,2,6300216977,"I rented this because I am trying to meet my goal of seeing all the Best Picture winning films. I sat watching it waiting for something to happen! What was it about? What was the point? Who cares? Why the depressing story  of a dysfunctional family, trying to get over the death of their son is  entertainment, I'll never know. I didn't think that Mary Tyler Moore did an  overly good job, nor did Donald Sutherland. Judd Hirsch did an excellent  job, but he was the only one who even came close to Oscar quality, and he  didn't even win! All I can say is, that it's a mildly interesting movie,  shot in a beautiful area, and it posesses wonderful direction.",952732800,4,658,4.396694214876033
261132,5,6300216977,"Redford has given us one the most remarkable films of our time.  Put down Tuesdays with Morrie.  Put down The Road Less Traveled. This film tells us all we need to know about living honestly.  Just buy the darn thing.  Trust  me.  Um, where's the DVD?",952646400,2,251,4.3478260869565215
261133,5,6300216977,"Robert Redford brings Judith Guest's novel to the screen with razor-sharp eloquence.  This movie, a keenly observed portrait of an American family dealing with the loss of one of their own, has no fat.  The Oscar-winning screenplay by Alvin Sargeant sounds utterly true on the tongues of these  talented players, each of whom is drawn with empathy and humanity.  The  WASPy ambience underscores the central conflicts, both for Conrad (Timothy  Hutton), who battles his own guilt/demons, and between him and his  emotionally devastated mother and father.  Mary Tyler Moore deserved the  Oscar (she lost) for her portrayal of Beth, a woman who exists as a veneer,  and Dinah Manoff haunts you as a fellow suicide survivor whom Conrad  befriends.  Too, Elizabeth McGovern is awkwardly charming, like a new-born  fawn about to grow up; Donald Sutherland does a memorable turn as Conrad's  awakening dad.  Judd Hirsch brings a surprising but unaffected warmth to  the key role of psychiatrist, and while the movie stays within the confines  of its own fragile, upscale but emotionally crippled world, it makes a case  for therapy as a universal healing.  Set on Chicago's North Shore,  virtually no detail is without its own peculiar gravity, from the sound of  Beth's expensive shoes on the rich carpeting, to the jagged hair Conrad  butchers himself, to the shivery feeling Conrad engenders in the  uncomfortably real swimming scenes. Everything moves towards the revelation  that will unlock Conrad's heart at last, from the seasonal change of autumn  to winter, to the score -- a choral Pachelbel Canon whittled down to a  single key stroke on the piano -- to the psychiatrist's office becoming  darker, darker, darker still - until we find ourselves in the middle of a  painful Christmas night.  Ordinary People remains as powerful today as it  did when it was first released, a testimony to the power of honest  elegance, and to the spare, stripping away of the layers we often bury  ourselves within. Heartbreaking.",945993600,7,2017,5.0920245398773005
261134,5,6300216977,"I cannot comment of the greatness of this film enough. Robert Redfords directorial debut deserves something to be admired. While Timothy Hutton also in his first role recieves the Oscar (as does Redford for directing,  and the film for best picture). The story of a young boy, after attempted  suicide and the loss of a brother, tries to get along with his parents. The  mother is cold and distant, while the father attempts to bridge the gaps of  love. A tender film so well told. One of the most realistic films I have  yet to see. If you are taking psychology, be sure to enjoy it, you will see  it quite a bit as it demonstrates many psychopathologies and family  therapies that are involved. I highly suggest this film with a box of  Kleenex.",945216000,2,747,4.522388059701493
7806381,5,6300216977,This film blew me away with how good it is! Just excellent all around. It pulls you in and doesn't let go. I love how realistic it is about people's feelings of loneliness and frustration when dealing with grief and how it highlights how difficult it can be to keep going in a world that keeps on blithely spinning when it feels like yours has stopped. A very cathartic and healing movie. The acting is great!,1526169600,,409,4.394736842105263
