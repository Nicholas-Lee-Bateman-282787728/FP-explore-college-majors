8073127,5,B000A2X60E,"We have all of the Brain Candy videos released so far...and have just acquired this new series.  I can't express how fun it is to watch my children (4 1/2,3 and 1) devour the rotating scenes...dance with the children in the video, respond to the characters...laugh out loud...and talk about Bruce Brain and Ivy Eyes for days afterward!  Even better - the music in the videos is catchy as are the characters' voices...which we, as parents don't mind listening to!

We actually don't allow our children to watch much tv at all, but on the minimal occasions that we do, it's important to us to choose something that we feel will be BENEFICIAL to the kids...stimulating their little brains, prompting questions about what they've seen on the screen, learning to be kind, gentle and fun with others.  Rather than set our kids in front of the tv to become complete zombies...we'd like to see that they're getting something out of their occasional tv down time.  The Brain Candy videos fit this profile for our family, and we feel pleased to have these as a prominent part of our (otherwise small) video library at home.  Buy this video!  Your kids will love it!",1193097600,,1155,4.688118811881188
