8368234,5,6304698844,"This George Strait concert was recorded new years eve 1986 and the music is excellent, his band The Ace In The Hole was phenomenal that night as they are for every performance.  George Strait was in great voice and he smiled and intertained as best as any singer could or ever would.  As it was pointed out by another, he had lost his daughter that year.  And if you've seen that man perform before you'll notice there is not the usual spark in his eyes.  I'm sure his heart was breaking the entire time, longing to face the new year with his daughter still in his arms.  But even so, his performance was classic Strait, energy in the swing tunes and breaking those women hearts as he sang the romantic ballads. There has been and always will be just one George Strait.",1184976000,3,769,4.387323943661972
8368235,5,6304698844,"I just searched for this tape on Amazon, and for some unknown reason it said it came out in 1959. That is so wrong, it came out in 1997..the poor guy just lost his daughter and he jumped on stage and did a concert that New Years Eve. The part that brought me to tears was at the end when Norma jumped on the stage to hug him happy New Years. It must've been devastating to him. But it was so nice after all these years to watch it again..buy this VHS and see what George is all about. You won't be sorry! He will mesmorize you!",1139961600,4,527,3.9345794392523366
