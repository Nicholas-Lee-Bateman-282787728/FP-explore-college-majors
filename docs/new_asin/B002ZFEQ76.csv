4017705,3,B002ZFEQ76,"This film worked as a study in grief. The characters were sensitive, tried real hard, and worked through some heavy stuff. The idea of a bestselling author/speaker running seminars on grief when he had a few not-so-hidden bones rattling around in his closet was very intriguing. And I really liked the way it all played out.

What didn't work for me was the Eloise (Aniston)/Burke (Eckhart) romance aspect. I didn't understand why, in the midst of his struggle/depression, he became so passionately fascinated with her. I also didn't understand much of their relationship overall and why there was such interest on both sides. Many of their moments together just felt painful.

There was no sex but there were a few token comments. Overall pretty clean with some moderate language. If you like introspective relationships or exploring the fascinating world of mourning, or Eckhart or Aniston you might like it. I'd suggest a rental first if you are unsure.",1267056000,8,956,5.044303797468355

There was so little spark, so little believable dialogue and/or character development, that I found myself just wishing it would end.  I waited for a long time for it to get better, but by the time I realized that was never going to happen, I probably had ten minutes left to go.  To make it worse, those last ten minutes were painfully slow and insultingly stupid.  DO NOT RENT.

4017708,4,B002ZFEQ76,"""Love Happens"" is the perfect name for this true turn of heart film.

Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart star as florist (Eloise Chandler) and self help guru (Dr Burke Ryan) as they slowly run through each others' emotional defensive shields.  Dr Ryan, is a successful self help speaker who helps people deal with grief and loss, but cannot deal with his own issues.  Eloise Chandler is a florist with several 'lost' relationships.  Through the film both main characters dodge what is happening, and when they least expect it, love truly happens.

So much for the summary.

Unlike man films with truly predictable outcomes and even dialogue, Love Happens, falls just outside the envelope.  It is not predictable, but more believable as far as scripting goes.  Not sappy, but sappy enough for the lover of chick flicks, it strikes the right chord.

Both Aniston and Eckhart are believable in their roles.  Their onscreen chemistry is remarkable and renders this film one of the best in current memory.",1265760000,22,1000,4.969879518072289
4017709,3,B002ZFEQ76,"Love Happens is NOT anywhere near a great movie.  Nor is it anywhere near a terrible one.  It falls someone in between.

I'm very pleased that the powers that be approached the topic of death, loss, and finding and accepting new love in one's life.  Far too often in films the characters seems to exist in a magical land where nothing ever really hurts and when it does, that hurt doesn't last for long.  Unfortunately, the previous promotional campaign made this seem like a film which was far more slanted into a Romantic Comedy that a Romantic Drama.  Anyone sitting back to watch Love Happens who expects a rom-com will most likely be a bit disappointed.  Had those same powers that be promoted this film properly it probably would have had a bit more box office success.  But, on to the film itself...

As I said, it's not bad or good, just sort of average.

I quite liked Jennifer Aniston's work throughout the film.  Aside from Friends, and a few movie roles, she really had never impressed me much, but in Love Happens, she plays the part of Eloise very well.  Indeed, her performance is understated, but that's just how it should be.  The story isn't about Eloise, it's about Burke and his struggle to allow himself to move on after his wife's passing.  Aniston plays Eloise well enough not to detract from the Burke Ryan character, but instead add that little something extra and offer the push that Burke needs.  She's the love interest in the film, not the star.

My main problem with Love Happens lies in Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Dr. Burke Ryan.  The storyline is so rich with heartache and apprehension, yet I didn't really feel any of that within Eckhart's performance.  He seemed far too wooden and ingenuine in his emotions to effectively portray someone in the grips of a year's long inner crisis.  I get the fact that he's supposed to have bottled all that hurt and agony up within him, but Eckhart doesn't bring it out at all until the scrip call for him to completely break down on stage and even then it just doesn't seem believable.  There's no inner struggle, no genuine sorrow, and no real pain.  Overall, his performance was just sort of... well, blah.  Had either Mr. Eckhart or some other leading man been able to dive into the emotional depths that the role required, Love Happens could have been a very, very good film.  As it is, it's just okay.  Certainly worth watching once, but there's simply not much value in repeated viewings.",1265241600,2,2468,4.620689655172414
4017710,4,B002ZFEQ76,"It is not often that 'popular romance comedies' have the courage to tackle issues like death and grieving and make the story work, but such is the case with LOVE HAPPENS, a good little film written  (with Mike Thompson) and directed by Brandon Camp.  And it helps to have a solid cast of popular and well-schooled actors to pull off a subject that might make a few people uneasy.

Dr. Burke (Aaron Eckhart) is a seminar man who runs a business with his colleague Lane (Dan Fogler) based on helping people cope with grief - a group called 'A-Okay'.  Burke is a popular guru, more so because of his reason for ministering to grievers: his beloved wife died three years ago in a car accident so Burke can speak about grief from experience. But it seems he is running away from something, too.  Most of his followers don't notice, but one man Walter (John Carroll Lynch) is a particularly needy client and seems to pick up on something missing in Burke's seminars.  Burke is currently in Seattle  (his deceased wife's home) with his manager Lane (who is cooking up all manner of marketing tools and opportunities for the A-Okay team). Burke happens to literally bump into Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) who owns a flower business catering to the hotel in which the seminar is being staged. Eloise seems addicted to losers, and is freshly apart from her latest affair: she is comforted and supported by her sole employee,  the somewhat dingy Marty (Judy Greer in a terrific cameo), who encourages Eloise to look for some stability in her next mate.

Burke is attracted to Eloise but is so out of practice in the dating game that he comes across as vulnerable - a trait that makes Eloise wary at first and attracted later.  The odd things the two do in the mating dance finally result in the uncovering of the secret problems Burke carries.  Refreshingly enough the film does not sell out with a happy-wappy ending, just a few thoughts that are particularly tender.

Eckhart and Aniston are a terrific team on the screen: both are lovable without resorting to being sappy and repetitive.  Fogler and Greer are excellent as are such fine actors as Martin Sheen and Frances Conroy in memorable cameos.  There is a lot to like in this film that makes it a step above the usual 'chick flicks' that were more popular in theaters.  Perhaps audiences, sadly, have difficulty hearing about grieving, but death, as well as Love, happens!  Grady Harp, February 10",1265241600,46,2442,4.697183098591549
4017711,3,B002ZFEQ76,"It is not that I would say this is a bad love story film, just run-of-the-mill with Eckhart at the helm (and I enjoy his movies). Technically it was a mess though.

The story follows a self-help guru as he travels to Seattle (Vancouver subbed but the large volume of CGI shorted both of the cities). As he performs his schtick, we are made aware of his tragic back story, family issues and other assorted concerns. Aniston appears as the random love interest that wants to fix him all whilst dumping her current boyfriend.

The Blu clarity is solid throughout, to such a point the CGI was almost irritating. They green screened every single outdoor shot, sometimes using horrible pictures of Seattle blown up outside hotel windows (so poorly done that the same window over two scenes had two different views of the American skyline). The DTS was uneventful with the exception of a few crowd scenes in the meeting halls. The special features were bittersweet and include:

* Giving Romance a New Look, 3 minutes. Essentially an ad plug for the FX company - helps one realize how much CGI was in this story.
* Deleted scenes, 6 cuts totaling 13 minutes, in HD. They cut out the majority of one character's role (Aniston's loser boyfriend) - glad they went, nothing worth watching unless you are a fan of Joe Anderson (Amelia, Across the Universe).
* Commentary, these guys were so self-congratulating I called it quits at the 16 minute mark.
* BD Live, only feature is to save clips and share them with your buddies, nothing else.

The performances are fine, but the story just felt forced. When you see the Vancouver skylines it feels like a waste that they screened them out (beautiful mountains). The Seattle shots look miserable at times so there was definitely no location chemistry. To me, this BD is a renter as you will get a clear pic and sound, but lame supplements with a fair amount of plot misery make for a lower rating.

4017713,3,B002ZFEQ76,"""Love Happens."" I can't think of a title that better encapsulates the conventions of a Hollywood romance. In stories like this, love just sort of happens, usually between people who seem so different yet magically have a lot in common. Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) is a widowed author and self help guru who tries to deal with everyone else's problems but can't seem to deal with his own. Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) is a florist whose track record of bad relationships has hardened her heart. They eventually meet, and ... well, it doesn't take a degree in cinema to see where this is going. ""Love Happens"" isn't an especially bad movie; in all honesty, there are aspects of it I thought worked well. But on the whole, it's really no different from any of the countless love stories released year after year, the characters broadly drawn, the plot sappy and hopelessly predictable.

Taking place in Seattle, which may or may not be a reference to the fairy tale romance of ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""Love Happens"" is at its best when the focus shifts from falling in love to coping with loss. The most interesting relationship is not the one between Burke and Eloise, but between Burke and Walter (John Carroll Lynch), a former contractor who lost everything after the death of his twelve-year-old son. Burke, whose wife died in car accident, understands Walter's pain. But because Burke has omitted a few details, understanding is not something he projects; for the most part, he sounds like your average self help celebrity, spouting generalizations and prefabricated messages for improving your life. What great conflict--we have two men unable to move forward, yet one behaves as if he has. Because of that, he thinks he can instruct other people on how to do it.

But that's not what this movie spends most of its time on. Burke meets Eloise by accidentally bumping into her in the hallway of a hotel, where she has just written the word ""quidnunc"" on the wall behind a painting. (In case you're wondering, ""quidnunc"" is a real word. It means a busybody, or someone who interferes in the affairs of others.) She has a tendency to write out long, obscure words like that, although for the life of me, I have no idea why. This is, quite frankly, a very peculiar quirk, and yet it has virtually no bearing on the rest of the plot. So why bother bringing it up? Even if it was a vital plot point, what would it ultimately prove? That she's both pretentious and a vandal? Fortunately, she does have more redeeming qualities, such as collecting and copying sentimental Thank You and I Love You cards sent with flower arrangements.

What's easy enough to understand is the fact that she has finally broken up with her rocker boyfriend after he cheated on her yet again. Her cynicism and distrust reaches a new level when Burke approaches her and asks if she would like to have a cup of coffee or something; in response, she pretends to be deaf by mimicking sign language.

Needless to say, they will meet again and slowly begin the process of building a relationship. In order for it work, however, Burke will have to let go of the past. A large part of this involves working up the courage to confront his father-in-law (Martin Sheen), who sees Burke for the hypocrite he is. Is Eloise the one person who can give Burke the nudge he needs? Is Burke finally ready to let the healing begin? And what about his career? His agent, Lane (Dan Fogler), has introduced him to powerful media and marketing people who want to see him on television pitching various products. Of course, he will be paid handsomely for it. So it becomes a question of whether fame and fortune are more important than lifelong happiness.

I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I do give this movie credit for telling the occasional joke without resorting to desperate comedy, which is more than I can say for recent Hollywood romances like ""The Proposal,"" ""Made of Honor,"" and ""27 Dresses.""

The unfortunate tradeoff is that ""Love Happens"" is at times weepy and melodramatic, more so than necessary a story about trying to move forward. The most intense outpouring of emotion comes near the end of the film, when Burke and his father-in-law finally say what they've been meaning to say for a long time; it's a cathartic moment, no question, but at the same time, it isn't even remotely plausible. To be fair, the entire premise isn't even remotely plausible. As I said earlier, love just sort of happens in stories like this, which is probably why audiences tend to favor them. In the case of ""Love Happens,"" most will be drawn to Eckhart and Aniston, who have surprising onscreen chemistry despite completely different performances. Still, when a non-romantic relationship between two grieving men is more compelling than a blooming romance between a grieving man and a distant woman, your goal of making a classic Hollywood love story has yet to be achieved.",1253318400,3,4931,4.7345750873108265

the plot

Dr. Burke Ryan is a national icon for self-help therapy on how to get over recently deceased loved ones in our lives.  He gives weeklong seminars on the subject all over America, and is a household name thanks to talk show personalities like Oprah Winfrey and the like.  Burke had written a book named A-Okay! about the steps he had taken after his wife had died in a tragic car wreck three years ago.  The country loved it and this resulted in his well-known celebrity.

Burke has come back to his hometown of Seattle to deliver his latest seminar.  This is the one town he'd like to avoid most of all, but on this trip he had met the beautiful and interesting Eloise Chandler.  Burke hasn't dated since his wife's death, but he can't help but to pursue Eloise.  She is resistant at first, she is unaware of his celebrity status, and is somewhat involved with some dude who cheats on her.  Burke's persistence wears her down and she agrees to go out with him and give it a try.

Eloise begins to feel more than a friendship for Burke, but she accidentally discovers that he has a deep dark secret that could ruin his business, but if he doesn't fix things, they could destroy any chance the two have at finally getting together.  What will happen with Burke and Eloise?  Will they finally become a couple?  Find out when you watch Love Happens.

the breakdown

This film covers all the basics with what any romantic comedy would need; an attractive lead couple, quirky flirting, some past flaw or secret that annoyingly keeps them apart even though they should be together, and a climatic ending where we see the two get over their baggage and become one.  I think it's pretty safe to say that Love Happens incorporates this basic formula, and it even goes that extra mile as they throw in a couple of ""shocking"" twists to throw the viewer for a loop.  Love Happens even includes some very touching scenes that tug at your heartstrings from the supporting cast, so...how come this film doesn't work that well?

Primarily, the writing didn't figure in any heat at all between these two main characters.  For the majority of this film, the two are basically new friends who decide to hang out together for a few nights.  Aaron Eckhart's aloof behavior for the majority of the movie needed to be understood a bit earlier in the movie for the two to do couple things together.  They weren't believable as a couple, yet it's mainly due to the poor writing and direction.  It appears that Jennifer Aniston did not get the direction she needed from Brandon Camp and therefore threw a good deal of her own personality into the Eloise character which made her seem slightly stuck up, totally disinterested and detached enough that she could never take a guy like Burke Ryan serious.

Dan Fogler's character (Lane) is somewhat reminiscent of his Stu character from Good Luck Chuck.  As Lane, the sidekick agent, he is not as overtly sleazy as Stu, yet there is a hint of it brewing underneath somewhere.  Lane is perhaps the most likeable character of the movie.  And in sharp contrast there is Marty, the obligatory selfless girlfriend to the female lead who has no life of her own, and therefore needs to live vicariously through Aniston's Eloise.  Judy Greer, who now seems to have been typecast as this supporting cast role plays Marty with the usual results.  You can catch her playing pretty much this same role in other films such as 27 Dresses, 13 Going On 30 and The Wedding Planner.  My problem with actresses like Greer playing these roles is that she is too attractive and her character comes off as implausible.  She is just as attractive as Aniston and this forces the viewer to overlook this fact in order to swallow that she couldn't have a love life just as interesting.

Although I don't think that the kids would appreciate this one, I'm sort of surprised that this film was rated PG-13.  The language wasn't out of control, and the sexual content was at a bare minimum.  The only scenes that maybe warranted this rating were the ones that dealt with the stories of death that the partakers in the seminar would tell.  Yet even these weren't so bad as to earn the PG-13 rating.  PG would have fit a little better.  This film is fine just to pass the time for one night, not recommended for multiple viewings.

4017760,2,B002ZFEQ76,"Review of Love Happens
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

In Love Happens, a motivational speaker helps people in support groups come to terms with their grief. Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, a romance must be thrown into the plot. The promotional poster makes it look like a strict romance, and the title itself tries to distract from the drama of the actual plot. The romance is not only unnecessary, but it actually harmed my overall enjoyment of the film. If the Jennifer Aniston character didn't exist, I probably would have wanted to watch it again. Once Americas sweetheart, she seems to be typecast in girlfriend roles, where if her character were completely eliminated, the story would plod along just fine. Lets hope she finds a leading role soon.

The reason the movie has any redeeming quality is because of the actors in the small roles. I don't know where the casting director found these actors; it feels like they were secretly taped during a real grief seminar. How do you walk onto a Hollywood set for your one and only scene in the movie, and deliver a powerful tear ridden monologue about your dead child? These people who had five minutes of screen time made the entire movies viewing worth it. It was truly incredible to watch such talent flit across the screen, however brief the scene. As my grandpa always said, you can find talent even in the smallest town.",1497225600,,1392,4.677551020408163

4017858,5,B002ZFEQ76,"It's funny that movies with titles like ""Love Happens"" tend to show that love is the magical elixir to human dramas. I totally agree, but love is not only being with somebody special, love is also to be happy with your life and the person you are, putting aside, errors, guilts, regrets and remorsements of the past. This movie is not about a great romance, it's about a human that says everything is Ok, but sadly, it's not. He needs to accept his reality, that there is no way to be entirely happy if you are not congruent with what you say and do. This is the main subject of Love happens, you cannot transcend in life if you forget of being honest with what you did and who you are. If you want a new perspective of life, see this movie with your a heart open!",1449705600,,764,4.204081632653061

At least Aaron Eckhart has a better range.  There were a few glimpses of the PNW weather and sites, but not done  up like a Chamber of Commerce ad. Not bad overall.",1426896000,,470,4.318181818181818

4017908,4,B002ZFEQ76,"The only reason I couldn't give this movie five stars were for some of the bad language (which was only a few words towards the end), some of the partying, and the suggestive language the one friend uses. But that's just from someone who doesn't like hearing the bad words and such. Otherwise this movie was touching. As a life coach I enjoy stories with a look inside how people think and cope with things that happen to them; this movie is centered on that. A man who teaches other people how to move beyond grieving the death of a loved one finds himself barely coping when having his own flash backs, regrets, guilt, and grief. I love the friendship that builds between these two and how much she is willing to help him out. It's something that is inspiring for me; how often does one go out of their way to help people they barely know or people they may only know for a short time? The portrayal of someone dealing with grief and trying to hide from it stays true to its nature, and there are plenty of truths taught throughout this movie of how to deal with it. The end was a tear jerker for sure, but was a happy and beautiful ending as well.",1422403200,,1150,4.279816513761468

4018028,1,B002ZFEQ76,"I'm shocked that the majority of the reviews are positive.  For me, the story was ridiculous, boring and disjointed.  There were so many contrived moments and unsympathetic acts by the characters that it was impossible to engage with the narrative.  Jennifer Aniston's character's (""Eloise"") daily presence at the hotel Eckhart's character (""Burke"") was conducting a seminar in didn't make any sense;  Eloise's rejection of Burke's initial attempt to ask for a date and his reaction was faintly repulsive (she pretended she was deaf and he freaked out and ran off); the seminar Burke was running seemed to be on at random weird times during the day and night; the content seemed like completely baloney (it all revolved around dealing with death and required participants to scream out ""I'm a-ok"" often); the seminars were a plot devise used to ultimately show Burke himself wasn't dealing with his wife's death despite the junk he was peddling (which made him a very unsympathetic since he had up until that time been profiting by being a charlatan - and profiting in the worst way - taking money from really vulnerable people who are struggling to deal with their grief at loosing a loved one); the extent of thought and effort put in by Eloise for the second date didn't make any sense with the relative contempt she'd been showing Burke up until that point.  The movie had the cringe worthy unfunny best friend - I assume her complete inappropriateness as well as her incompetence at her job was supposed to be somehow endearing, but I thought she added another unappealing layer to the entire mess.

There was absolutely no chemistry between Aniston and Eckhart so that on top of a poor plot just made the whole movie work to watch and impossible to suspend belief.  This movie has popped up on a few `top romantic movies' lists (which is why I looked it up and watched it)... I have no idea why since there are many many more fantastic fun movies out there (eg ""Ever After"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Once"", ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"").

I just watched this on DVD with my mom, and having practically zero expectations, we both liked it a lot. I believe it was Brandon Camp's directorial debut (as well as screenwriter), and we were curious to see the film that was so promoted by his father, Joe Camp (since we both subscribe to his blog). We both feel that if the movie had been promoted for what it is, an engaging drama with a few moments of light comedy to even things out, it would have done much better at the box office. Even the title was way off base - this movie is not about their romance, but rather about grieving, denial, and finally healing.

From the opening scenes, the fantastic cinematography captured our attention, and the pace of the unfolding story kept us interested.  We both cried buckets at the end, but were given a parting chuckle to lighten things up. Sure there were some contrived moments, but it's not a documentary - and we were entertained. I know the Camp family must have put their hearts and souls into getting this film made, and I wish the public's expectations had been set properly so that the film could have succeeded on its own merits, instead of being compared and coming up short, to the lighter, fluffier rom-com genre. We thought it was a winner.",1304812800,3,1342,4.51440329218107

Chemistry.  There is a legitimate chemistry between LOVE HAPPENS stars Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart; they're not cookie cutter one-dimensionals that populate so many other films of this genre--these characters are believable, interact believably, and harbor true anguish and pain.  Eckhart, playing self-help guru Burke (who has penned a bestseller about how to deal with pain and loss), by fate meets Eloise (Aniston), who is the florist for the Seattle hotel where Burke is conducting a seminar.  Even though Burke is helping others cope with their grief, it becomes more and more obvious he's bottling up some pain of his own.  (His wife having died in an auto accident some years before.)  Meanwhile Eloise has been in one disastrous relationship after another, but she has a heart of gold and is willing to help Burke--if Burke will first help himself.  All of this rushes headlong to a climactic scene featuring an interaction between Burke and his former father-in-law (Martin Sheen is very special); this scene was so compelling and poignant and tender I had to keep reminding myself I normally don't like movies like this.

Sure, much of the film is sappy and contrived, and Eloise's habit of leaving obscure words behind paintings at the hotel struck me as more than annoying, but overall I very much enjoyed LOVE HAPPENS.  Dan Fogler and John Carroll Lynch stand out amidst a solid supporting cast.  There's pain, there's humor, there's romance, there's anguish--in short, there's life.  Why?  Because LOVE HAPPENS.

4018100,2,B002ZFEQ76,"If there are two people on the planet with less chemistry that Aaron Eckhart and Jennifer Aniston, the British monarchy would already have found them. A shockingly poor pair for a cop-buddy movie, let alone a morbidly obsessed quasi-rom-com, it makes you long for the days when Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan would fallen in love... again.

The Script-o-rama quality plot goes something like: a widower who finds success as a self-help guru, dates a flower shop owner and comes face to face with an inner truth he has been suppressing. If this sounds like a book, that's probably because it's a book. To spice things up, however, the story has been set in Seattle - mostly near the space needle thing, since that's the only part of Seattle that exists in the movies, unless you include Samara's well. In lieu of a plot, the writers have been kind enough to give us corny cliches every 5 minutes or so, and I'd recommend taking a shot every time one rears its head in yet another clunky scene.

Here were my favorite groan-inducing, and yet potentially shot-slamming, moments:
- The lead lady is a good-as-gold flower shop owner - a passion of her's to be sure - who's only customer is some crazy old lady who probably pays in coupons from the back of parking tickets.
- Her only employee is a idiosyncratic poetry-slamming hipster, who fails at maintaining flowers effectively but exists to provide fortune cookie-quality advice to her.
- The hero's dead wife made a last request that ""he set her parrot free"", barely realizing the irony of the metaphor for his guilt. And the irony that parrots largely like to sit still and would rather imitate a car alarm that go for the this whole freedom gig.
- Eckhart's audience of self-help followers respond to his ""telling the truth"" initially with a slow clap, developing into a standing ovation, and then ""I love you, man"" rousing support. All while Martin Sheen is clamped around his shoulders like a possessed limpet, bawling his eyes out, and apparently wearing the same jacket as he had in The Departed.
- There's a retail therapy scene where everyone shops at Home Depot, in a very poor and distant imitation of the Pretty Woman montage. Buying hardware apparently helps one of the main characters overcome his son's death. And that actor is the scary guy from Fincher's Zodiac Killer.

There are many more, but then there's also some plain nonsense. Such as Aniston's old vintage car that reveals her old-fashioned and solid character values. Or that she graffitis barely-understood words behind pictures, presumably for one lucky man to find, thus enabling our hero to learn more about her by searching for the words (yes, really). Then there's an old lady who makes cookies out of her husband's ashes.

I'm suspecting that this was originally a fairly dark script about dealing with death, then the studio injected a romantic subplot because a major star got involved. Or it was a passable romantic comedy that got toned down due to a test audience screening. Either way, what's left behind is a romantic half-plot that is completely dishonest with itself and a ""dealing with grief"" lesson that mixes random half-truths with utter phoniness. Add a bunch of underused characters, a parrot, shake and bake, and you're done. The drinking game has potential though.",1284249600,3,3307,4.827160493827161

4018125,1,B002ZFEQ76,"This movie reminds me a lot of other films in the same genre.  It resembles a trainwreck.

The saddest thing about the whole pie is that it took two knuckleheads to actually write it.

By the end, I didn't really realize that love happened, I just kept thinking that it was a really long seminar in Seattle and that nothing was resolved at all...and what kind of seminar is this, anyway?  I couldn't tell if he was a motivational speaker, a grief counselor or a lying hypocrite.  Maybe the answer is All of the Above.

Aaron Eckhart plays a motivational counseling hypocrite who has lost his wife in a devastating car accident.  Don't worry if you miss the flashback the first time because it's rehashed at least eight more times throughout this masterpiece.  They just speed up the film rate (aka slow motion) of the dog on the rainy road for maximum impact...but it honestly just makes you laugh the more they show it.

Anyway, Aaron sees a pretty flower girl who sure lounges around this hotel lobby an awful lot.  It seems like she should be in housekeeping as opposed to a florist.  Her name is Jennifer Anniston.  He asks her out and they fumble their way through scenes for about an hour + where nothing really happens and neither character is remotely interesting.

A bad sign for a romantic comedy is when neither character has any redeeming quality.  Eckhart sits around, drinks vodka and feels sorry for himself regarding the loss of his wife....yet he runs a seminar on trying to help people how to cope with a loss.  There's a bumbling character that wants to quit the seminar, who lost his son, and the filmmakers stumble their way trying to make this some sort of subplot...thankfully, all Aaron has to do is to take him to the Home Depot and give him a shopping cart.  Huh?

This movie almost lost me at the very beginning when there is a montage of artsy compositions of lemons being cut up into wedges.  The scene ends where they say something along the lines of, '...you have to make lemonade.""  The camera pans to the right and there's a bottle of Grey Goose.  Whah?

It definitely lost me about four minutes later when we are introduced to who Eckhart is as he gives an introductory speech at his seminar where you're just scratching your head thinking, what the hell was that and what sense did any of it make?  ""He wins the National Championship Game, goes home, and shoots himself in the face.  OK, we're gonna have a great week, I'll see you all very soon!!""

What is Martin Sheen so ticked off about?  He hates the bird, he runs to the closing ceremony to yell at his son in law about the bird, he makes up with him, he...what the hell is going on?  And who cast Eckhart's sidekick who has a perm mullet and just seems completely out of place the entire time?  I do think the best part of the movie is the dramatic confession by Eckhart at the end and they show mulletman in tears.  My wife and I were both cracking up.

My husband continued to watch it and at the end I heard Martin Sheen greet the parrot home. What a bunch of ____ing nonsense. As one person wrote, ""It's not a homing pigeon!"" That parrot would have died long before it would have found its way home. I don't know if it would have frozen to death first or died of starvation first but I'm certain it would not have survived. They ruined an ok movie.

4018146,2,B002ZFEQ76,"My wife and I just watched this movie, and we agreed that it was a very weak effort. We both like this kind of movie, we both like Aaron and Jennifer but there was just no chemistry between them at all, and we did not come to care about either character they played. Neither character seemed to have any substance to them, just one or two obvious traits for the plot to develop. It's a barely passable movie. If you're really desperate for another romance movie, I suppose it can pass the time OK, but I can't recommend it. John Carrol Lynch, Dan Fogler, and Judy Greer were all more interesting to watch than the leads, who seemed to be going through the motions.",1270598400,3,664,4.362903225806452
4018147,3,B002ZFEQ76,"Starring Jennifer Aniston and Aaron Eckhart in a romantic love drama with a twist this movie is set on a bizarre premise.  Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) is a widower who happened to be in the car the night his wife died in a tragic crash.  He took his feelings, wrote a book and turned it into a themed talk show on the circuit of lost souls.  Who in the hell visits these talk shows anyway.  The oddity, or I should say one of the oddities in this movie is he doesn't even follow his own set of rules on how to embrace life once you have been faced with the death of a loved one.  He can't even ride in an elevator.

I should state at this point for the record that I like this movie a lot.  It got terrible reviews and my guess is that people in the world today like all of their romantic comedies tied up in a neat little bow.  If anything veers from the cookie cutter template that is implanted in everyone's generic brain we label it bad and move on.  This movie in my opinion deserves better than that.  It takes a shot at real life problems and the psychological quirks that somebody might develop when the love of his life is prematurely taken.

Burke Ryan makes his way through life helping people deal with death.  He holds workshops on how one might take the next step after the loss of an 8 year old son, how do you move forward after your husband dies, how do you face the next day after your mother passes away.  One elderly lade even made oatmeal cookies out of her husband's ashes because he loved them so much.  She kept the cookies in an earn and brought them to the seminar.  I might have lost my lunch if Burke would have taken a bight but lucky for us he passed.  In the midst of all this death he finds himself through a quirky flower shop girl (Jennifer Anniston) who has her own issues but maintains her positive outlook by writing obscure words behind paintings in hotels.

Getting a little scared at this point.  Again, if you are looking for a romantic comedy that follows Meg Ryan or Sandra Bullock down a preordained path this is not for you.  If you want to watch a movie about sadness, death and how love and hope can evolve this is worth a shot.  I am not saying that the storyline and acting was top notch.  It isn't the best movie that I have seen but I have seen far worse movies that have gotten far better reviews and ""Love Happens"" deserves its spot in the interesting movie section.  I liked it but then again I have a demented pessimistic outlook on life.  My girlfriend says if it weren't for her there might not be any positive energy in the house.  haha

Sometimes I feel like a nut and sometimes death is a catalyst for life if we open a window and let at least the smallest ray of light inside.  Who knows, you might even be able to make a batch of cookies out of the damn thing.",1269907200,,2821,4.187384044526902

4018150,3,B002ZFEQ76,"Burke is a motivational speaker who's book about dealing with grief is a best seller. His wife died in a car accident three years ago. He's in Seattle to lead a week-long workshop on healing and to negotiate a major multi-media deal. But something's amiss: he's a closet drinker, he won't ride elevators, his moods swing, he's estranged from his wife's father, and he's very much alone. In a hotel hallway, he bumps into a woman arranging flowers, tries to chat with her, and gets the brush-off. She's Eloise, a local florist who's just broken up with a boyfriend. He's persistent and they eventually go to dinner and it goes badly. There are some smiles during the movie, but it is actually a light drama dealing with bereavement and grief. I thought this movie was ok. I thought Aaron's character was interesting. However, Jennifer was just Jennifer.",1268179200,2,852,4.802721088435374
4018151,1,B002ZFEQ76,"This is not a good movie, the characters are tedious and hard to care for.  The plot is formulaic.  Okay, so are at least half the romantic movies, but they usually don't include the completely irresponsible and cruel treatment of an animal.  A tropical cockatoo wouldn't survive for long in the cold and rainy Northwest.  Outside of the simple fact that the bird would freeze, a tame bird is not able to forage and find food, if there were any appropriate food readily available in that area.  Animal cruelty is not funny, charming or cathartic and those who were involved in this movie's making should have done their homework and at least cared a little bit about the message they were putting out there about letting tame birds go.

I even fast forwarded through some of it just to make the movie end sooner. Disappointing.,1267833600,,374,4.357142857142857

This film started out with much promise but devolved into a formulaic and not very interesting yawner. The main problem, I believe, was that there just wasn't any chemistry between Jennifer Anniston and Aaron Eckhart. The both give it the old college try, as does Charlie Sheen, who was convincing in his role. Maybe it was the script. All I know is that the gears never meshed in this. It would've been better if someone had taken the money it took to create this and sent it to Haiti instead!",1267660800,2,638,4.508620689655173
4018154,1,B002ZFEQ76,"I'm a fan of Jennifer Aniston and I thought her performance was great in this movie. I would probably have given the movie 3 or 4 stars.

But just as I was enjoying the movie there is this scene with setting his dead wife's parrot free. I'm thinking what? Setting a tropical bird free in Seattle to fend for it self? Yes I know the bird used in the movie was not harmed or set free for real. But what kind of message is that to give your audience. It's ok to send a tame tropical bird out in nature. A bird who has lived it's whole life in a cage. It would have no chance of surviving in the wild. Especially not in a climate it does not naturally belong to.

I think they could have left out the thing with the parrot, and used something else for their plot the parrot was used for.",1267315200,9,783,4.012820512820513

8384740,1,B002ZFEQ76,"I watched this movie years ago but just saw it alongside other older films to rent or buy, and I have to say something. How anyone could give this irresponsible and ridiculous attempt at humor anything other than a one star really saddens me. As I said, it's been awhile, though I did write a review on another site (and I rarely leave negative feedback). I'll mention the least important annoyance first. It's my memory of Jennifer Aniston's character following Eckhart's character into the men's room in order to tell him off. Gosh, how original! And now I recall something about Eckhart's immensely obnoxious character leading his acolytes into busy Seattle traffic for some New Age, self-help reason I cannot recall. Finally, and most serious and deeply irresponsible is the treatment of a pet cockatoo. First we see the bird being kept in a tiny cage in a grouchy man's house (Martin Sheen), and believe it or not, Jen and Aar decide to release the pet bird, a tropical bird with no survival skills, into the woods of the Pacific Northwest in Autumn. And they do so. If a viewer couldn't care less and just wants to see Jen kiss Aar, or if confirmation of the fact that humanity as a whole truly is a useless species, then this might be a good choice.",1527897600,,1256,4.611607142857143
