8071439,5,B000A0GPNG,"One of the most beautifully photographed and well acted films from Mexico's so called Golden Age of Cinema. This is a stark film about revenge and it's consequences. The perfect casting of some of the era's best actors together with an great script and beautifully directed by one of the world's best directors, Ismael Rodriguez, make this a must see for those who truely appreciate great movies or have interest in cinematic history. The story of two half brothers raised by a vengeful mother and trained by a an expert gunslinger to avenge the murder of their mother's first husband is a story that goes to the very heart of what revenge can do to the human spirit.  It also continues in the long tradition of revenge stories from Spanish history and literature which has long influenced Mexican culture. While the DVD quality is not the best it is very watchable and well worth your time.",1281312000,2,891,4.711538461538462
8071440,5,B000A0GPNG,"The genius of Ismael Rodriguez can be seen in every frame of this exquisite masterpiece, which he adapted from a story by Ricardo Garibay. With a star-studded cast, and breathtaking cinematography by Rosalio Solano, the perfection of this film make it a prime example of Mexico's Golden Age of cinema. The film begins with the voice of Arturo de Cordova, saying: ""Una historia antigua, que occurio en las llanuras del norte de Mexico, cuando la paz era buscada a travez de la violencia, y la justicia tenia las formas de rencor,"" and goes on to weave a complex, heart-wrenching tale of violence, revenge and remorse, in a cycle that can only be stopped by sacrifice.

Two brothers, who witness the shooting of their adoptive father as children, are the main characters. The older son, Reynaldo (Antonio Aguilar), is strong and tries to refrain from seeking vengeance, but his brother Martin (Julio Aleman), traumatized by the event, and goaded by his mother (Columba Dominguez), seeks out the killer, Don Velasco (famed director Emilio ""El Indio"" Fernandez). The scene between Reynaldo and Don Velasco is pivotal, and shows how history will repeat itself, as the two brothers fall in love with the same woman.

Julio Aleman (whose career is still going strong in telenovelas) is riveting as the deranged but charming Martin, and in smaller parts are Pedro Armendariz as El General, Eduardo Noriega as Reynaldo del Hierro, el padre, Patricia Conde as the young Jacinta, David Reynoso as Jacinta's older brother Manuel, and Ignacio Lopez Tarso (who played the title character in the classic film ""Macario""), as the wandering El Pistolero. Antonio Aguilar's Reynaldo is unforgettable, with the scene of him helping milk the cow forever etched in my mind (""Ay Jacinta...Jacinta!""). Though some say the Epoca de Oro ended in 1959, this film, which has not received the acclaim it deserves, certainly extended it, and is one of the the best of the best. Not to be missed, and should be released with subtitles so it can be appreciated by a wider audience.",1175040000,7,2049,4.970845481049563
