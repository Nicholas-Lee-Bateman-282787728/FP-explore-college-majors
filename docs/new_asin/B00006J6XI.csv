1780311,5,B00006J6XI,I don't care what people think of Robert Blake. This is a must have for having A complete 70's Tv Hits collection!,1258070400,8,114,4.2272727272727275
1780312,5,B00006J6XI,"Robert Blake is ""Tony Baretta"", a tough detective who always gets his man on the street, and the women too.
  Robert Blake was in his prime in ""Baretta"" which aired on the ABC Network, January 17, 1975 to 1978 (80 episodes).  The tv series was a re-working of another ABC tv series ""TOMA"" (1973-74), that starred Tony Musante, based upon the real-life detective who made special appearances on-screen from time to time.
  The first episode on this DVD is the test pilot episode ""He'll Never See Daylight Again"" that was broadcast Friday night, January 17, 1975. Regulars: Dana Elcar, Michael D. Roberts, Tom Ewell. Guest stars: Joseph Mascolo, Madlyn Rhue.
  ""Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow"" is episode 10, broadcast April 9, 1975. The title of this episode is also the title song of the theme music that plays during the opening credits. In later seasons, Sammy Davis Jr. would sing the title song. Guest stars: Burt Young, Jerry Hausner.
  ""The Secret of Terry Lake"" is episode 11, broadcast April 16, 1975. Guest stars: Margot Kidder, Nick Colasantro, Allan Rich, Joe Santos, M. Emmet Walsh.
  Darn those boy scout meetings and flthy camp-outs I had to go to. I always had to miss ""Baretta"".
  Mr. Blake knew it was time for the series to end when he was filming a scene where he was sleeping and the Cockatoo bird pecked his toe. Blake in such pain, wanted to kill that bird.
  Robert Blake (MIckey Gubitosi) was the ages of 41 -44 when he played ""Baretta"". He ended Baretta and decided to get himself together.
  In 1985, he returned to television in the NBC tv series, ""Hell Town"". He played a priest, ""Father Noah 'Hardstep' Rivers"", who wanted to help the people in his community.  He wasn't exactly playing Baretta, but once in a while, their would be an in-joke.  After only 18 episodes, he decided to depart the show because he needed to take care of himself.
  In the 1990's, he appeared several times on The Late, Late Show with Tom Snyder, talking very candidly and frankly about things that had happened in his life.  In return, he learned that the fans still appreciated him.
  Currently, Robert Blake is raising sheep and likes to travel on his own free will.

This DVD only contains 3 episodes. No specials, No extras. Option of subtitles in English, Spanish, French.

If you really like the Best of Baretta, you can now buy the entire Baretta: Season One DVD set. The background music really sets the mood.

That damn cockatoo!",1172188800,17,2444,4.676056338028169
1780313,5,B00006J6XI,"The humor of Starsky and Hutch and the attitude of Miami Vice rolled up into one solo package. This is one grungey cop show. Tony Beretta grew-up on the wrong side of the tracks but trust him to use his streetwise antics to bring the bad guys to justice. This was my favorite police show when it was syndicated in the latter 80's. Just don't confuse this guy with Columbo. Beretta dosen't fight fair. Buy this if your into gritty street cops and keep an eye open for season 2, there's no word on it but there is hope.",1116028800,5,517,4.232323232323233
1780314,2,B00006J6XI,"I give this two star, ONLY BECAUSE....and I mean this....WHY BUY THIS DVD SET WHEN THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON HAS THESE SAME EPISODES? I give the FIRST SEASON DVD SET about 10 stars, because I love watching Baretta. It brings back some great memories. Truly just ""one"" of the best shows from the seventies. So any fan of this show would know, why waste the money. I'm not sure why the companies do this. JUST PUT OUT THE OTHER SEASONS. Then we'll be happy.",1078444800,54,455,4.428571428571429

7970230,1,B00006J6XI,"First of all I want to say that I LOVE Baretta the television series. The ""one star"" rating is for this particular DVD. Three episodes for $15.00 -- I think that is just a tad too much.

The one-star rating is also for the ""EDITORIAL REVIEW' section of this product page. It says that Baretta lasted for three seasons -- it lasted for four seasons with 24 episodes. Check IMDB for the listing about the fourth season.

So could you PLEASE make ALL four seasons available. I would absolutely buy a Complete four-season set. Or if you want to make it available by individual seasons, I would go for that as well. If you folks read the reviews, it looks like I wouldn't be the only one who wants this full product. thank you very much.",1490572800,,732,4.375
