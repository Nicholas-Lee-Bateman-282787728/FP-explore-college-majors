2323857,3,B0009VBTOG,"I watched this with my eleven year old son yesterday.

He was a little apprehensive with the PG-13 rating but his face brightened when he read the criteria for the rating. Stylized martial arts violence, he mused. It should not be too bad.

We began watching as we have with movies of this genre before, expecting the imposiible to happen which it frequently does.

My fiftenn year old daughter wandered in just as the hero is saving a panda cub shortly after the start. Oos and aahs soon ensued but she wandered off in disgust soon after when the hero, not in disguise, meets her chief protagonist from the local law enforcement agency who she recognises as a school chum but he, in return, consumed in his own ego trip does not recognise her.

My son soon found fault with the plot. The police chief is seen in retrospect advising the little orphan girl he has taken under his wing (no pun intended) to fight with a bag over her head so she will not get into trouble, yt he has difficulty recognising the now adult girl as his contemporary even though he is reading a magazine article about her at the time.

And so it goes, and so it goes. Michelle Yeoh is in a class of her own with regard to the martial arts form and continues to be here. There is plenty of action, silly dialogue, oddly two-dimensional relationships etc etc. It seems trite but did we not see the error of not recognising Clark Kent as Superman without glasses years ago as being a major drawback?

This film is a pleasant piece of escapist nonsense guaranteed not to tax the brain or even wake it from a stupor. However, compared to current television it is in the major documentary class. I feel the rating is too harsh. Parental guidance yes as it seems to me, judging from the reaction of my own family, that this is the sort of thing which should be directed at under elevens rather than older. Even the presence of adult themes does not diminish my argument as they are treated in a supercillious fashion.

I had a reasonable time watching this for the ninety minutes or so with my son but at the soccer match afterwards he discovered that when you fall you do get hurt and you cannot get back up half as quickly as these very fit thugs can.

The cityscapes and interiors had a futuristic look to them, though many seemed to be shot in real buildings (lots of glass, lot's of white and pale hues). Beautiful women are everywhere. If anything, even with the action, it's practically G rated, so t's ok for kids.

But it's the friendly banter between the brother and sister (Silver Hawk) that keep it fun. The actors speak english, it doesn't look overdubbed, but I wonder if the film was made with the actors voicing over their lines later, rather than using a microphone on the physical locations. The subtitles are garbage and useless. But you don't really need them.

I either could not stop smiling or laughed my dupa off through the entire flick.  Countless killer one liners and lots of great gestures.  There is an even creepy James Bond type villain globalist message embedded in it, to boot.  Check out the info in IMDB:[...]
This is cinema that comes out of Hong Kong, and is great to see. Things like visual set dressing, goofy dialog and music, choreography, and the not so fictional mind control angle, plus a kitchen sink of other elements are all in there.  Not to mention, the silly English overdub of Chinese dialog.

Like Napoleon Dynamite, or Sideways, this is the kind of movie that will make you laugh later for no good reason.  You might even start quoting lines out of the blue.  Too bad it isn't in BluRay format.

It was probably intended for teens in Asia, but I would not be surprised if it showed up on a kid's channel here in uS of A.

Maybe I'm wrong and it's just silly, but a whole cast of big name actors took a chance and showed up in it, so it had some appeal to them.  We need some silliness in this dystopian world from time to time.",1361750400,2,1267,4.2510460251046025

Frustratingly glossy and superficial, this is one for folks who can take style over substance, even when said style isn't presented very well.

The story: a martial arts superhero (Yeoh) pits herself against the organization of a criminal mastermind (Luke Goss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B00005JKWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>) looking to enslave the world through a mind-controlling phone headset.

It isn't supposed to be, but it still leaves a lot of questions unanswered as far as the superhero aspect of the picture goes. It's established that Silver Hawk was a martial arts prodigy as a child, and the origin of her mask is somewhat explained, but how the heck she got ahold of that cool motorcycle of hers and taught it to fly over the Great Wall of China is unexplained. I also don't know how she got her boomerang throwing blades or why she's even called herself ""Silver Hawk."" Oh well. The movie opens with her rescuing a baby panda from poachers, and if she had continued with such humanitarian missions, the film may have been a bit more interesting, because the ""mind control headset"" angle is pretty uninvolving. There's a standard side-story about her being involved with a policeman who's determined on arresting her alter-ego (Richie Ren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-News/dp/B000E0ODEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking News</a>), and that's not very interesting either. Ho-hum.

""Silver Hawk"" has a very superficial gloss to it, and looks a bit too sleek for its own good. The entire movie sports an overexposed lighting effect, so most scenes look like they're part of a dream sequence. There are a few fun sets, but nothing to blow your mind. This carries over to the fight scenes, which are a mix of wire-fu and grounded fighting but almost routinely stink. Action choreographer Ailen Sit generally delivers good stuff, being a veteran of Jackie Chan pictures and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-Soccer/dp/B004XVMCPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin Soccer</a>, but I think that director Jingle Ma (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulan/dp/B003ATD7OO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulan</a>) approached the action content with the notion that western audiences actually enjoy a lot of jump-cutting and camera close-ups. Buddha preserve us, are the fight scenes ever mucked about with these atrocious techniques! Nine fights are to be seen - three featuring Michael Jai White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Bone/dp/B002FU8JTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood & Bone</a>) - and only two of them are worth watching. These include the showdown with Luke Goss, who fights with metallic ""prosthetics"" attached to his arms, but even this one doesn't rise above so-so.

On the bright side, Michelle seems to be having fun with her role and is entertaining to watch, and a couple of minor tangents are enjoyably silly (e.g. excusing herself from dates to fight crime, Silver Hawk encourages a rumor that it takes her four hours to dress herself). However, in the end, the biggest plus the movie has going for it is that it's only about 99 minutes long - I don't think I would've stood for much more than that. I'll definitely be checking out more Michelle Yeoh flicks in the future, but this one deserves to be forgotten.",1353715200,,4346,6.1080196399345335
2323959,4,B0009VBTOG,Michelle Yeoh as always is a great master.  Her fighting and her handling of her bike are superb. The actor that plays the policeman that is after her plays it sort of on the corny side thinking he is a gift to women but in the end he comes thru.

Armed with ancient fighting techniques and high tech hardware, Lulu is a beautiful masked millionaire battling to defeat a greedy entrepreneur intent on enslaving the world. Based on a comic book, Silver Hawek, is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, packed with cars, gravity-defying martial arts fights, and, at the center of it all, one sexy heroine. Two final comments: (1). Michelle's major photograph at the back of the DVD shows what a sexy and voluptuous Michelle is. In fact I feel aroused for a long time after seeing this photograph; (2). There are too many laughs toward the end of the DVD which degrade Silver Hawk's overall value. I prefer Michelle from the Bond's movie or from Supercop movie. Maybe this is the reason why Silver Hawk is a fiasco in the USA and Europe. That's why I gave this movie 4 instead of 5 stars.",1256083200,,966,4.932515337423313

2323972,3,B0009VBTOG,"Like most other reviewers have stated Silver Hawk is a entertaining movie with great stunts and fight sequences but with a weak story. The movie is about woman (Michelle Yeoh) who leads a double life, by day she is a popular model and by night she is Silver Hawk, a vigilante feared by most criminals. The story gets in gear when Yeoh must save a man who was kidnapped by some crazy villain. The man invented an Artificial Intelligence program that he intends to use for good but his nappers want it to take over the world. Now already the movie sounds like a comic book clich and trust me it is in every way but somehow Michelle was talented enough to keep interest in the movie until the very end. I knew Michelle had skills but man she really killed this movie, the fight choreography was amazing and the stunts were also nice. One notable scene is when Silver Hawk is in the middle of a warehouse full of guys hanging from the sealing on bungee cords trying to hit her from every direction. Sounds like Tomb Raider but I like this bungee scene a lot more.  Basically the best way to put it is Silver Hawk is worth seeing but only for its great fight and action scenes because at the end it's the only thing you'll remember.",1162857600,2,1227,4.334782608695652

Michelle Yeoh looks better than ever and her fighting is gorgeous. The movie has a bit of a campy feel to it, which I loved. Martial arts movies that take themselves too seriously can be so excruciating. There is a lot of kindness and tenderness in the movie. The characters are adorable in their deficiencies and even the bad guys have real love relationships. I don't think anybody is actually killed in the movie. Silverhawk is a great heroine, subversive and generous. I love it that she seems to have so much fun kickin a**-- do all crime fighters need to have such grim attitudes?  And she has a fantastic superstar wardrobe.",1152662400,3,743,4.586466165413534
2323974,2,B0009VBTOG,"Someone else said they were embarassed to see Michelle Yeoh in this film. I would have to agree. What's worse is that she produced it too(with her production company Mythical Films). I'm quite a fan of Michelle, and I love her movies, but this was indeed pretty painful to watch. I've always believed she was such a great actress, but the acting in this movie really suprised me: it was terrible. It was very forced, even Michelle's. I felt like I was watching a High School play where everybody had just learned how to memorize and read lines! I was shocked, because Michelle has done a great job in her other movies(see ""Ah Kam"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", and ESPECIALLY ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""), but this was just not good. Plus, if I have to hear the wonderful Michelle say a line like ""Totally fab!!"" again I'm going to pull my hair out.

Michelle herself did say that this was no award winner. It was a movie that you could watch without having to think(that's what she said!). I would have to agree with you there, Michelle. I think if I was 10 or 11 I would have enjoyed this a little more.

The stunts and fight scenes were okay. I've seen better. Michelle is like no other woman on this planet, however, when it comes to kicking ass and doing her own stunts. She is incredible and an absolute Legend. Anyway, back to the film...

The outfits Michelle wore were just...wow. Like someone else said, the cheese is laid on very thick. It's corny as all get out, and again, the stunts were nothing special. If you want to see Michelle really kicking ass, go for ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" or some of her Hong Kong classics like ""The Heroic Trio"" or ""Wing Chun"" or something of the sort.

The only saving grace to this film(other than the fact that Michelle was in fact in it) were the two children who played young Lulu and young Richman. They were absolutely precious beyond words and did such a fantastic job! I wished the movie would have had more of them in it, because I think it would have been better! The panda was pretty cute too, although it only appeared for a brief minute or so at the beginning of the movie.

Was it worth the $7 that I spent on Ebay to buy this? Probably not, but as a fan of Michelle I feel compelled to watch as many of her movies as I can, even the crappy ones. This would probably be one of those decent movies to watch when you're watching it with a bunch of friends and you feel like poking fun at it and making sarcastic commentary.",1143849600,5,2485,4.37012987012987
2323975,3,B0009VBTOG,"Between `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and `Memoirs of a Geisha,' Michelle Yeoh has done two action films - Indiana Jones-like action `The Touch' (2002) and `Silver Hawk' (2004). Michelle Yeoh stars (and even co-produced) both of the films with English-speaking cast.

Of these two action films, probably `Silver Hawk' is better, but not still good enough. One good thing about `Silver Hawk' is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a comic book action, in which the titular heroine Silver Hawk (Yeoh) saves a stolen animal from the smugglers, and then she can save the day too. Clad in silver costume, wearing a long silver cape, masked Yeoh plays Lulu, beautiful celebrity businesswoman, who leads a secret life as Silver Hawk. Luke Goss (`Blade 2') plays `Dr. Evil' type baddie while Richie Jen Hsien Chi plays Detective Rich Men who happened to be little Lulu's friend in their childhood.

The film is set in near-future, but the main attraction is the actions of Michelle Yeoh, who shows her stunts in an acrobatic (and often comical) way. As she did in Jackie Chan's `Police Story 3' she shows her considerable skills in death-defying motorbike riding, jumping over the Great Walls of China. It is not CGI, and unlike her previous film `The Touch,' (which suffered from overloaded special effects), the stunts themselves including bungee kung-fu battles are very good.

However, these good materials are sometimes ruined by slow motions and choppy editing. We know Michelle Yeoh is doing her own stunts - and she is over 40 years old, remember that - but except the two I mentioned above, Director Jingle Ma (`Tokyo Raiders') has no creative ideas about how to show the actions. The characters' histories could have been more interesting with more detailed episodes about their personalities, and decent dialogues, but the childhood memories shared by the hero and the cop remains half-baked idea. It is a pity because the two child actors are so adorable.

It is regrettable that `Silver Hawk' could have been much better. It is a kind of Hong-Kong made `Tomb Raider' with more tongue-in-cheek moments. It has good stunts and Michelle Yeoh too, but it is the story that uses them poorly.",1136592000,6,2207,4.956756756756757

2323977,1,B0009VBTOG,"There is a place fearful to those of us who enjoy good and solid films.  This is a place where a person can watch a film and after about ten minutes desire to pull their own eyes out.  Truly Silver Hawk is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  After the first 10 minutes I truthfully felt like jumping out of a window for wasting 5 dollars at Blockbuster.  I later found the will to live by watching Spiderman 2, Blade, and Batman Begins.

I have no idea what the director or the actors were thinking of when they took on this assignment.  So as not to rant and rave forever about the emotions I felt upon watching this.....horrible thing called a DVD here are my problems with it.

The movie is basically a take off of the whole Bruce Wayne style hero who is wealthy aristacrate by day hero by night.  In this case though Michelle Yeoh's character, Lulu aka Silverhawk fights crime ONLY in broad daylight.  I don't think that night time even exists in this movie.  The action scenes are overdone and never present themselves as really anything of danger.  At one point Silver Hawk saves a bride at an outdoor wedding by catching a falling peice of plywood with her fingers.

There really is no plot, and Silver Hawk's war on crime seems really like pretend to begin with, as the film never presents itself as something that can be taken seriously.  What is also disappointing is the fact that Michelle Yeoh, Michael Jai White, and Luke Goss have played in major films before.

My best advice for anyone even considering watching this film is.....life is to precious to loose time on a movie this bad.",1135555200,,1605,4.4520547945205475

There are a number of martial arts action sequences which pay homage to the Hong Kong wire action sequences. The scenes and locations are well chosen.
