7908300,1,B00000FDUT,This video is no big deal.  One episode with Curly and a bunch of other stuff that is just not funny.,960163200,11,101,3.8095238095238093
7908301,1,B00000FDUT,"Thank God it only cost five bucks...this video is a turkey.  If you're  looking for original Stooges (Larry, Moe & Curly), you'll be  disappointed with this one.  Two hours, only one Curly episode in there.  Three Shemps (second-rate), and the rest is 3 Stooges cartoons (need I say  more?), and other filler.  Can anybody recommend a video packed with  original Stooges?  Please drop me an e-mail...thanks.  And even if it's  only five bucks, don't waste it on this",924393600,41,466,4.846153846153846
