8675523,5,B00N15RSLU,"I was skeptical about this Blu Ray DVD ... one of my favorite movies I have been waiting for in High Def. But it has delivered!!

It IS High Def (Blu Ray ... good quality, obviously from the original HD filming) with the original sound tract when you select ""Ingles"" (my Spanish is not so good).

It is well worth the cost (shipping was fast) to get such a great movie [I'm a retired Army Officer and a Survivalist]. Works perfectly on my US zone Blu Ray Player :)",1444176000,9,464,4.202247191011236
