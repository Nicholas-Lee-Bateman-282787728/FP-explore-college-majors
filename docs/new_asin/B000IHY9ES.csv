8145831,4,B000IHY9ES,"If you think there are some exciting cars on the streets today, you won't believe some of the incredible cars that are being designed and created for future markets.  `Extreme Concept Cars' is a showcase of amazing engineering and technology.

Sprinkled in with all the video of different cars are interviews with designers from major car corporations and their thoughts and ideas regarding up and coming concept vehicles.  Two different but prominent organizations are looked at in this feature.  One is the world famous Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.  This is a nice look at how scale models of prototype concept cars are envisioned and then built.  The time and effort put into these endeavors is quite extraordinary really.  The second area looked at is a concept car maker in Switzerland with some terrific ideas and models of his own.

With oil being a finite natural resource, innovations in new power methods are shown here also.  Looked at are vehicles with Hydrogen internal combustion engines and natural gas powered motors and their importance in the future.  One vehicle is even shown that has completely recyclable body panels, soy based materials in the interior, and tires derived from corn based substances.

Here is a taste of some amazing vehicles featured in this program:

Toyota Pod - designed to respond to occupant's emotions

Mercedes-Benz M-300 Life Rocket - an extreme 3 wheel design

Chrysler Air Flight - art deco type body styling

Chrysler Tomahawk - 4 wheel motorcycle with 10 cylinder, 500 horsepower Viper engine (theoretically capable of 300 m.p.h.)

Cadillac `16' - 16 cylinder / 1000 horsepower engine, eight thousand dollar crystal inlaid steering wheel, incredible good looks

These are but a few of the fantastic creations this documentary will show along with possibilities for even greater machines in the years to come.  At only 48 minutes long, they pack in as much as they can in the duration of this program but you might end up wishing it were longer like I did.  Still, for what you get to see and for entertainment value in general, this is a decent production even if you don't have a strong interest in automotive subjects.",1180828800,10,2197,4.96986301369863
