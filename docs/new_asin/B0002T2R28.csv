8031581,5,B0002T2R28,Why are the sonic x series dvds so damn expensive? My 3 year old loves Sonic X and he watches what dvds I could find for him constantly and thats all I care about.,1331769600,2,163,3.823529411764706
8031582,5,B0002T2R28,"I would have to say it's probably one of the best Saturday morning like cartoons I have ever seen.  There is kind of a sad ending to the series though, leaving a lot unexplained.  Some say that the series is complete, but I think they planed on having a lot more personally.  Oh ya, and good job on the prompt delivery.  It was in good condition too :)",1290556800,,352,4.132352941176471
