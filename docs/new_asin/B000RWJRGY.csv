8202850,1,B000RWJRGY,"Not a movie but a short 30 minute ""documentary.""  I think our resources would be much better served trying to make those who have been through the trauma of abortion feel whole again, than to shame them and take puritan stances beforehand.",1466985600,,239,4.690476190476191
8202851,4,B000RWJRGY,"Norma is honest and vulnerable as she recounts her life story and history about how she was drawn into the abortion debacle.  It should certainly give someone pause to think (and think again!) about having an abortion, and there is a lovely forgiving and compassionate tone about it for women who have experienced abortion and have to live with that decision.",1397260800,,359,4.885245901639344
8202852,3,B000RWJRGY,"I am very strongly pro-life, but this documentary did not add anything to the conversation for me. It's basically an explanation of how the woman who came to be the ""Roe"" in Rose v. Wade came to regret her involvement in the case. The documentary would have been strengthened by sharing the views of women who made the decision to keep their children and why they did so.",1357344000,,371,4.470588235294118
8202853,2,B000RWJRGY,"Only 30 minutes in length, I was pretty let down with this ""movie"".  I was expecting more background information, and a bit more exciting narrative rather than watching Norma McCorvey speaking in a dull tone for about 20 minutes.  This movie didn't really go into detail about the life of Norma and why she decided or how she came into the case of Roe v. Wade.  Overall, 2/5.",1293321600,3,375,4.485294117647059
8202854,5,B000RWJRGY,Very moving and chilling document regarding Norma McCorvey (Roe vs. Wade).  I have an admiration for TRUTH and it is told on this DVD boldly and emotionally with heartbreaking details of MURDER.,1269302400,4,194,5.0625
8202855,5,B000RWJRGY,"I am so glad I purchased this movie. It brought me to forgiving Norma McCorvey for what she had done, & helped me to know she saw what she had done was wrong & came to Jesus for forgivness. I've shared it with many others who have shared it with their teenagers & it is helping them to know abortion is murder. I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to be informed about abortion.",1252627200,8,385,4.1466666666666665
8202856,5,B000RWJRGY,This is an excellent video that explains how Norma McCorvey became associate with Roe V Wade and how here experiences working in abortion facilities haunted her into becoming the pro-life advocate she now is. Very moving testimony. Everyone should watch this video to see the truth of the damage that abortion does to all women.,1212192000,14,328,4.9818181818181815
