Pulitzer is a middle aged bachelor who seems to want to just sew himself from one woman to another, and not have anything to be responsible for except his fortune. Enter Roxanne who's a struggling insurance salesman who meets Pulitzer when trying to sell him a insurance policy, and even though it looks like Roxanne flubbed the sale Pulitzer is interested in her, and takes her on a skiing weekend, and after a whirlwind relationship it's marriage time. However, Roxanne learns that it's all about Herbert, and if Herbert is allowed to have his way Roxanne can have whatever she wants. Pulitzer exposes Roxanne to the heady side of being rich with non-stop parties and cocaine. However, when she starts hanging out with the wife of his best friend Pulitzer becomes possessive, and forbids the two to see each other except for a menage a trios( Pulitzer has sex with both ladies). When Roxanne feels enough is enough she begins to assert herself, but at a price as Pulitzer tries to have her committed to a drug rehab hospital. Then when that didn't work Pulitzer tries to divorce Roxanne, and buys her off with a deal, but then comes the trial, and this is where Roxanne learns the hard lessons of how the rich try to keep the outside of the cup clean, but F#%K to the inside being dirty. Roxanne tries to enlist help from Pulitzer's best friend's wife, but learns that she can't because she'll be dammed if Roxanne will pull her down because she's no longer part of the fake, plastic, and hypocritcal moral world of the rich and famous. Roxanne loses custody of her children, and that was the hardest of all because that was her life. Pulitzer didn't care about his sons; it's ""The nanny's job"", so any other woman by this time would just either slink away quietly, or kill themselves, but Roxanne takes a job at a health club for the rich, and makes a name for herself even when Pulitzer tries to woo her back. However, this movie while it has a rather hot Chynna Phillps in it, and is a rather interesting story just has too choppy an ending to it, and not even the courtesy of an epiloge tell us whether she won the appeal to get custody of her sons. This is a movie that makes me want to re-examine my own values especially if I become rich beyond my wildest dreams. If I was Pulitzer I would hope that I would not expose my Roxanne to cocaine, or endless parties where there are endless ************* kiss kiss people there who don't care about you as a person, and not expose her to a Menage A Trios. However, appreciate Roxanne as a very hot looking woman, and be happy that she's married to me. However, I won't lie I love my money, and especially spending it; I love the power it gives me, and so did Pulitzer. I could picture him dressing up as Ulyssees Grant flashing all the Roxannes in the world $1,000 bills while singing ""Don't You Want Me?"". I guess that's why I'm not in any hurry to go visit Palm Beach.",1117238400,,3045,4.468581687612208
