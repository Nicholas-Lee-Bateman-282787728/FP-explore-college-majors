5140850,1,B0084NZECY,"I never thought I'd ever go to amazon to write a one star review, but after watching this movie, I felt compelled.  Most one star reviews are full of capital letters, misspelled words, and childish insults.  I'm going to try to make this more intelligent than that.

I rented this movie because the back of the box made it sound awesome.  It described the lead actor, Zheng Liu, as ""the next Bruce Lee"" and an ""international martial arts star"".  If this is true, then this wasn't the movie to show it.  It also said, ""No CGI.  No Stuntmen.""  One of the first things you see in the movie is an explosion that looks like it belongs in a youtube video.  A few scenes later, you see Zheng Liu throwing needles that look like they were made by Pixar.  I don't have a problem with CGI, but I don't appreciate being lied to.  As far as no stuntmen, that may be true, but there's not any big stunts anyway.  When I see something specifically say, ""No stuntmen"" I think, ""Oh cool, this'll be like Jackie Chan or Tony Jaa.""  Nope, not the case.

As far as the plot, there's not much to talk about.  I'll admit I'm not a fan of the gangster/drug genre in the first place, but I just thought it was boring.  The main character seems to be dealing with some personal demons, but what they are is pretty vague.  By far the biggest problem I had with this movie is that some characters are raped(or implied to be raped), and then it's never brought up again.  These characters don't have any lines of their own.  The people who made this movie either hate women or just don't know how to tell a story.  I can't think of any other explanation for this.  Now I'm not one of those people who like to throw around the word ""sexist"".  In fact, I resent people who do that.  But if you're going to treat rape like it's some small thing that isn't that big of a deal, well, I have a problem with that.

I'm prepared to think this is one of those movies where the plot's just an excuse for the action.  Honestly, I wouldn't have a problem with that.  But the fight scenes are so few and far between, and you have to wait so long for these gangsters to get done talking to each other for an ass to get kicked.  The fight scenes are pretty cool, maybe the one redeeming thing about this movie.  But even then, it's not anything you haven't seen before.  The only real, ""Holy crap!"" moment of this film is when Zheng Liu wraps a metal bar around his fist and then goes to work on a guy.  I'll admit that was pretty cool.

So basically, it's just a bad movie.  Boring plot, not enough fights, and even the few fights it has aren't anything special.  And if you really want to see them, I'm sure you can find them on youtube, no need to actually sit through the movie.  Maybe Zheng Liu really is as good as they say, but if he is, I hope he chooses better roles from on.",1346803200,6,2842,4.201851851851852
5140851,3,B0084NZECY,"Wow, this is a tough one. The movie itself was actually fairly good, with multiple players, artistic execution, good direction and good use of modern technology for a foreign film. We had Colombian drug lords against Chinese, against Australian, etc. and in the center is a Chinese hit man. The problem with this movie is that it was sold as a great martial arts flick with the actor being the next kung fu god. However, the fight scenes were B-O-R-I-N-G, Lazy and amateur... horrible choreography. Most Jason Statham fight scenes are waaaay better although I'm no fan of his movies (that is to say how bad these fight scenes are). A martial arts film failed to deliver in the martial arts, but was pretty good in terms of being a straight-up action movie... if that made any sense.",1346544000,,782,4.673913043478261
5140852,2,B0084NZECY,"The plot didn't make a lot of sense. The Chinese mafia want to deal Colombian cocaine in Shanghai. They travel to Miami to make a deal with the Colombian cartel. They claim the street value of cocaine is twice what it is in the US. The Colombians balk, ethnic slurs are exchanged. People die. The next thing you know drugs are being shipped to Chinatown in Sydney, Australia via Miami.

When a woman is kidnapped, Zheng Liu is hired to get her back. At this point the film becomes a free for all. For some reason Latinos can't work with the Chinese.

The acting left a lot to be desired as it is in most drug/crime movies where everyone plays the ultimate tough guy. Zheng Liu, the star of the film is a subplot for most of the movie. He uses high tech gadgets and old fighting techniques. No CG fighting effects. There are better films to watch.

5140853,5,B0084NZECY,One of the best martial arts revenge movies to come along in a while. Acting is top of the line and you can feel the pain and anger due to great character portrayal. Drug king pins and yakuza at it's best. This is a must see movie!,1346371200,2,231,3.9361702127659575

8526209,4,B0084NZECY,"Cusack barely made it into the ""Acceptable"" category with this movie.  Hollywood ship must be sinking very fast these days",1519257600,,122,5.1
8526210,3,B0084NZECY,"Blood Money,"" according to publicity information, is a modern retelling of 1948s Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It stars John Cusack as a dangerous criminal who will stop at nothing to retrieve a huge sum of money after a robbery gone wrong.

It is stolen money that wound up in the river when embezzler Miller (Cusack) intentionally crashes a small plane in the forest to fake his own death, parachuting with four heavy bags of loot. He lands in one place, the bags of cash somewhere else. In the vicinity, three friends  Victor (Ellar Coltrane, Boyhood), Jeff (Jacob Artist), and Lynn (Willa Fitzgerald)  are on a camping trip. When Lynn discovers the money floating in the river, the dynamic among the friends changes dramatically. Meanwhile, Miller is determined to get the money.

The bare bones of the story echo Treasure of the Sierra Madre, but the film lacks the sharpness of writing and the memorable performances of that classic. Blood Money is an OK action thriller, but lacks distinction. Cusack looks lost and fails to give a consistent performance, sometimes coming off as oddly pleasant for a thief, at other times creepy and frightening. He should be menacing throughout in order to keep a decent level of suspense.

The portrayal of Lynn is not at all believable. When she finds the money, she changes from a nice college kid into a fiercely mercenary monster. Where does this come from? Its an abrupt change that comes about unnaturally  more to serve the story than to deepen character. A romantic triangle of sorts is an awkward contrivance to add more conflict to the story, but only serves to slow momentum and take focus away from the main plot, which is similar to 1998s A Simple Plan, a far better film. The theme is that money can shatter friendships and corrupt ideals

Rated R for language, violence, and sexual references, Blood Money is directed by Lucky McKee. Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include the featurette Blood Money Uncovered. A digital HD copy is enclosed.",1513728000,,2007,4.850877192982456
8526211,5,B0084NZECY,"Excellent action movie and out lead actor has potential to be a top martial arts/action star,but what else does he have lined up???? He's supposed to be ""The Next Bruce Lee "" ? He's gotta prove it and that means many more movies and against stronger competition. Also he needs to work with better,more well known actors and actresses. I wish him luck in all that he does.",1417737600,,371,4.470588235294118
