8648100,2,B00J4LMLX0,"This is another low budget Canadian film shot mostly in the woods. It is twice as good as ""Battle Earth"" but then again, twice nothing is still nothing.

The film opens on remote Archer island in the Pacific NW. A small group of US forces are testing out a chemical weapon which causes a person to go into a berserker mode and see the world through a red filter. Some unspecified years later. John Paxton (Douglas Chapman) boards a charter flight that fate demands crashes on said island with expected results.

There is quite the cast of characters on board which made the film enjoyable to a certain degree. Also the metal music added to the production. Clearly this is one of the better low budget productions. The film has character, a zombie-ish plot, minor humor, decent sound track and plot holes , yet at the same time its short 72 minutes seemed like an eternity. The main problem was the lifeless John Paxton character who was secretive about something we already knew. At the same time, the attacking creatures looked like.. well regular humans.

Low end rental.
