326570,3,6301348281,"I like this movie!  I say it with a little bit of guilt & slight shame, because as an Asian-american, I shouldn't!  First, for those who are thinking of getting this film, I should explain the plot!
Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre), member of the International Police Force, is sent to the Middle East to foil a plot by saboteurs led by Ricardo Cortez (as a ventriloquist/mercenary) & George Sanders (""Mister Freeze"" from the 1960's ""Batman"" tv show!) to blow up British ships on maneuvers. The bad guys are working for an un-named foreign power who want to strain relations between France & Britain, so that their alliance will crumble, clearing the way for the European aggressors (Germany & Italy?) to commence their territorial expansions.  With the help of a double, a British agent (John Carradine), various disguises, his detective skills, & his martial-arts ability (jiu-jitsu!), Mr. Moto foils the plot!
This movie, made before America's entry into World War Two, hints at Nazi Germany's growing aggression in Europe.  That's one of the things that's...strange...about this movie.  The protagonist, ""Kentaro Moto"", is supposed to be a Japanese national.  The fact that Mr. Moto is working with the British (to secure their relations with France), in essence, would have been contrary to his own country's interests, since Japan in the 1930's was itself an expensionist nation (making incursions into China) & was negotiating an alliance with Germany, an alliance that was realized in September of 1940, with Japan's joining with Germany & Italy to form the 3-party ""Axis Alliance.""  Japan went to war with Britain (after this movie was made), so Mr. Moto shouldn't have been on this particular mission.  (Charlie Chan or Mr. Wong, on the other hand, being Chinese nationals, would have worked for Britian.)
Another aspect that makes this movie strange to watch (for today's audiences) is the fact that Peter Lorre's ""Mr. Moto"" character is an example of ""a white actor in Yellow-face.""  That's the reason why I shouldn't like this movie.  By today's standards, the character is ""racist"" (or at least, politically incorrect!)  However, I think the writers were aware of this peculiarity, because Mr. Moto, in order to throw off suspicion to himself, takes on the identity of an ""oriental"" antiques dealer, speaking in forced ""ah-sos"" & ""thank you very much, please"" types of phrasing.  Later, however, when talking to his collegues, he speaks in perfect, intelligible English!  (Robert Coote's character even says, ""I say!  You're talking different!"")
Alright, I said I shouldn't like this movie, but I also confessed that I do!  Peter Lorre does a good job of playing Mr. Moto with a very subtle, but clear, satirical sarcasm.  I really get the feeling that he was aware of the stereo-typical nature of the role.  He actually seems to be satirizing (Hollywood's) racial attitudes with his portrayal.  (It's kind of hard to explain with words.  You need to see it!)  The martial-arts (""Very simple, judo, often mispronounced by foreigners as jiu-jitsu!"") is faked, but Peter Lorre does a good job of faking it!  The pacing for the film, being an espionage thriller, is decent (for the 1930's), & Robert Coote provides excellent comic relief as a bumbling English tourist.
The film-makers seem aware of the political peculiarties of the story by hinting at, but not naming, the Germans.  At the end, the other characters ask Mr. Moto which country was behind the plot.  Before Mr. Moto can answer, his collegue states, ""You better not answer that, Mr. Moto.  Otherwise, you'll be out of a job.""  Is this collegue implying that Mr. Moto, being a national of Japan, (a country who's interests are basically the same as Germany's), could be punished by the Japanese government for exposing the treachery of the Germans, potential allies of Japan?
Oh well, I would have rated this movie 3 & 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.  The reasons why I didn't rate it 5 stars are as follows:
1.  Lack of suspensful incidental music for key scenes.  (Typical of the 1930's.)
2.  I wanted more of Viginia Field's character!  She's Ricardo Cortez's girlfriend in the film.  The story touches upon her feelings of betrayal upon finding out what Cortez plans to do.  It was real interesting & I think the makers of this film should have expanded upon that relationship even more.
3.  Needs more close-up reaction shots for dramatic effect!  (Typical of most movies in the 1930's.)
4.  James Cagney should have given Peter Lorre judo lessons!  (The fight scenes are exciting, but using real martial-arts techniques would make them even better!)
It's worth buying, so check it out!
By the way, the actor playing Mr. Moto's double is a Japanese actor who I've seen in both ""The Delicate Delinquent"" (Jerry Lewis' first solo effort) & ""You Only Live Twice"" (the 1967 James Bond thriller.)  He's not credited in this movie (Hollywood racism in the 30's!)  Who is he?",1013385600,17,4943,4.968369829683699
326571,5,6301348281,"It is sad this movie is not available. Peter Lorre made a series of Mr. Moto films, and this is the only one I have seen in any format. I've owned a VHS copy for years, and have hoped someone would wake up, smell the coffee, and put out the  Mr. Moto collection. I mean, Peter Lorre is the star.
Mr. Moto's Last Warning is an excellent thriller containing a great script and superb acting. Doesn't anyone in the industry think that his films should be saved? Well, I hope someday, someone, will put them out. Im sure they will sell. If you get a copy of this one, it is a great film, but you shouldnt be suprised by that. Im amazed no one else seems to care. Well, here is hoping.

There are references to Mr Moto in other Hollywood films, similar to saying, ""So, Sherlock"" you could say, ""So, Mr Moto,"" and figure it out.  Made in the 1930s, his character is a heavy ethnic Asian stereotype of a shorter man with spaced, soft teeth, but he uses Ju Jitsu and outsmarts the dark side. The stereotype was part of the implicit racism of the day.  Could movie makers make good on Mr Moto in an updated series?  I think they should remake the Mr Moto series with Moto as a handsome, sophisticated Bond type Japanese who is posing as a business executive while fighting global crime.  Give the new Moto a nice smile, state of the art ocean and space technology, and beautiful sleuthing and crime solving.  I think an updated Moto could be a hit.

They don't make them like that anymore! Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, etc - the great character actors. Peter Lorre as International Police investigator Mr. Moto doesn't look the slightest bit Japanese with his goggle- eyed glasses and somewhat sinister teeth. Actually it doesn't matter. You can't keep your eyes off him when he's on stage in the movie.

326895,3,6301348281,"It has been a long time since I saw any of the Peter Lorre/Mr. Moto series and I am not certain if I ever saw ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning."" Mr. Moto is investigating bad doings going on in Port Said. A group of saboteurs are planning to blow up a French naval ship and blame the British (or is it the other way round? It actually does not matter.) Anyway.

Mr. Moto is undercover as a Japanese antique dealer (in Egypt, no less!) trying to uncover the group. The saboteur leader is a ventriloquist named ""Fabian the Great"" played by Richaro Cortez  He is aided by a suave, sinister and vaguely Slavic George Sanders and various other minions. There is the British undercover agent, John Carradine, the goofy British tourist, Robert Coote and the sexy, which side is she on British night club owner, Virginia Field. Enough of the plot--look at that cast! Peter Lorre, George Sanders, John Carradine & Robert Coote, I only wished they had more and better material. Cortez and Field are quite good too; but . . . Well, it is what it is and it moves quickly and is fun. Norman Foster's direction is efficient and tidy; and there is a good b-movie foreign atmosphere. I do wish that there had been a bit more Mr. Moto/Peter Lorre. Fabian/Cortez I think actually more center stage.

I should mention at this point, if you did not know already, that Mr. Moto is a Japanese detective on the ""International Police Force"" (or something like that) and is based on a character in a series of novels. There would soon be no more Japanese heroes in American films for quite some time. I should also say, if you hadn't guessed already, that there are definitely cultural stereotypes in the film. I take these things a product of their time and respond accordingly. Anyway, I like these kind of things and ""Mr Moto's Last Warning"" is entertaining  little movie.

I will say that ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning"" obviously fell into Public Domain as this source copy shows--it is pretty murky and duped looking. But at least I was able to watch the whole film, which wasn't the case of ""The Woman in Green""  the Universal Holmes that fell into PD--it cut off 2/3 of the way through the film and would go no further.

Peter Lorre, already solidly established in film, nonetheless gained many new fans as John P. Marquand's Japanese detective of the International Police, Mr. Moto. Born Laszlo Lowenstein in what was then Austria-Hungary, he shot to fame when Fritz Lang cast the German speaking actor in the now legendary film, M. Born into a Jewish family, he fled Germany in 1933, taking refuge in Paris, and then London. It was there that Ivor Montagu spotted him, and talked Hitchcock into giving him the colorful role of the assassin in The Man Who Knew Too Much. The rest, as they say, is history. While the stunts in the Mr. Moto series were not to his liking, Lorre was perfect in the role, and offered moviegoers a jam-packed hour of fun. Fans enjoyed watching Mr. Moto use both his brains and athletic ability to get over on the bad guys. While it didn't have the charm of Fox's other big franchise, Charlie Chan, it often had more action, and always a good cast of supporting players that kept the story interesting.

Mystery writer Philip MacDonald, responsible for so many mysteries during this period, helped write the screenplay with director Norman Foster. This one takes place in exotic Egypt, and has a very nice look to it, lending the goings-on a nice atmosphere. When a ship docks at Port Said, Mr. Moto of the International Police is keeping an eye on several of its travelers by means of a fellow agent, posing as Moto himself. When he is murdered, Moto must figure out which one of the group looking to strain relations between friendly countries as the world moves towards war has knocked off his friend. With George Sanders in another deliciously despicable role, this time wearing a monocle no less, and Ricardo Cortez as a ventriloquist right in the thick of the plot, this one is quite fun. Virginia Field is very nice as Cortez's girlfriend, who is unaware of his actions. Once she learns what he is up to, she makes a stand which may cost her dearly.

John Carradine is along as well a British agent embedded with the bad guys, but it is Robert Coote as nerdy mystery writer Rollo Venables, donning glasses and a bwana hat, that adds some humor and zip to this one. In a critical moment, he tries to help Moto and ends up bringing the bad guys instead!  Moto has some fun as a dealer in oriental antiques in this one, and gets to do both judo, and show off his underwater skills in a fun climax. A topflight entry in this long-running ""B"" series which entertains in exactly the way it was intended. Bolstered by nice sets, a good story from MacDonald and Foster, and the presence of Peter Lorre, as Jon P. Marquand's Mr. Moto, this one is a fun one. Be on the lookout for a brief Warner Oland nod in this one!",1285027200,3,2813,4.518664047151277
326917,4,6301348281,"As originally created by author John P. Marquand, Moto was an icy and distinctly lethal Japanese agent; 20th Century Fox, which had earlier created the extremely popular Charlie Chan series, toned down his more deadly qualities, cast German actor Peter Lorre in the role, and between 1937 and 1939 made eight films featuring the character. Although they did not really challenge the Chan films, they were popular in their own right, and it was not until American sentiment began to turn against the Japanese that 20th Century Fox dropped the character.

Made in 1939, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING is the sixth film in the series, and it finds Moto (Lorre) working to foil an attempt to set the English and French against each other by blowing up the French fleet as it enters an English-controlled canal in the middle east. Although the film has a slow start, it is graced with a gifted cast that includes George Sanders, John Carradine, and Ricardo Cortez, and it soon comes up a snappy pace and proves unexpectedly watchable.

Over the years the Chan films have drawn considerable condemnation from Chinese Americans due to the fact that Chan was never played by an Asian actor; somewhat curiously, the Moto films have escaped the same degree of politically-correct derrision. This is all the more odd because Lorre is even less of Japanse than Oland and Toler were Chinese. Even so, Lorre is always interesting to watch, and his unexpected physicality (Moto is a master of judo) drives the film remarkably well.

MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING is the only film in the series presently in public domain, a circumstance that seems more accidental than intentional. The Alpha release is very much in line with that: the picture is shaky, particularly in the opening segments, and the sound is quite weak. Fans of the series would do better to go with the series editions now in release through 20th Century Fox--but no matter which copy you lay hands on, you'll find the film an enjoyable bit of flyweight fun. Recommended to fans of 1930s mysteries, thrillers, and espionage movies.

LAST WARNING takes place in Port Said, Egypt.  A scrum of scoundrels are scheming to surreptitiously blow up Allied battle ships and foment distrust between France and England.

  Chief scoundrel being Ricardo Cortez, here playing a foreign agent masquerading as a ventriloquist - Fabian the Great & Alf is the name of his act.  Rounding out the cast is a number of skilled Fox contracts players - John Carradine, Virginia Fields, and George Sanders being among the more recognizable names.

  To the best of my knowledge, LAST WARNING is the only Mr. Moto title in the public domain, so this is the only chance most of us will have to catch the Moto fever.  Even though Lorre's Moto is an intelligent character,  Moto's usually undercover, disguised behind thick glasses and a sing-song, Good evening, preeze, persona.  I doubt the title-holder of the other five movies featuring such a politically incorrect character will be releasing them anytime soon.

The film tells us that it is based on the idea of Mr. Moto, but it does not say that it is based on any novel about him. John Carridine plays a bearded British agent, but has a small part, of no great consequence to what is transpiring. He got third billing. Similarly, George Sanders received fourth billing as a villain, but he was not the primary villain. The film is 70 minutes long. It involves the attempt by the French and British governments to form an alliance, and some person or government, not stated who or what, is doing all it can to disrupt the alliance.
In the film, Mr. Moto is an ""oriental Sherlock,"" a member of the International Police who was assigned the duty to find out why someone or some government is trying to sabotage the alliance and stop the sabotage. He is helping the British. He is portrayed as a smart man with abilities to disguise himself with fighting skills.
