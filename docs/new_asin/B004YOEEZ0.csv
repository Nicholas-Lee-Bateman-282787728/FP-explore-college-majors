I'm a music teacher, and I LOVE this DVD! All the stories are musical, and 3 of them have very useful information for kids! They've even found ways to make the credit sequence for every song interesting!

""Dem Bones"" has great animation, and is very easy for little ones to sing along with. It starts with the song, then has an interlude where all the bones from the song are described (bone name and functions). Then during the credits the song plays again, with ample opportunities for singing along. If you're worried about the skeletons being scary for kids, I think most will enjoy it; they do a good job of making the skeletons appear funny instead of haunting.

""Dinosaur Bones"", illustrated in the same fashion as the above, starts with the informative part at the beginning. It talks about the history of fossils, and the different kinds of bones and what each bone says about the dinosaur it belonged to. Then during the credits, the song comes in. It's a simple song that any kid could pick up easily, especially with the read-along function.

""Hush Little Baby"" is from the 1968 publication illustrated by Aliki. From the video and sound quality, it appears that this story was filmed around the time the book was first published. The voice of the singer is very soothing, and the pictures are cute. It sings through the whole song twice, the second time with the words at the bottom (but, of course, on the read-along function the words appear both times). The pictures aren't animated, the camera just zooms in on the pertinent parts of the picture.

""The Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night"" is based on the folk sing, with illustrations from the 1961 book by Peter Spier. ""Animated"" as with ""Hush Little Baby"", the music that accompanies this story is beautiful! It's a pretty slow version of the song, with a female voice and a folk band, featuring a beautifully played mandolin.

""The Erie Canal"" starts with a very brief history of the canal itself, then launches right into the song. Like with the other Peter Spier illustrations, this story is just close-ups on pictures, but the pictures are so detailed that it's hard not to be drawn in. Again, a folk band plays the song, and this time features the steel guitar (among other folk instruments). During the credits they begin the song over again, but only get through the first verse and chorus.

I can't speak highly enough about this DVD, it's SO interesting and well put together! I learned from it, and I can't wait for my students to do the same! I love that most of the songs are folk-derived, it's a great part of our culture!",1330646400,12,2860,4.671968190854871
