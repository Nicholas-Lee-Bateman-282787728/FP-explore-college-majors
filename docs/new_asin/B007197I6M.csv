8508034,1,B007197I6M,"Felipe Cazals, the last ""cult"" cinematographer from the Echeverra years, has made a life-long career trying to break away from the platitudes of Mexico's official history (oh yes; there's an official history in Mexico, and no elementary school is permited to stray from it!). Unfortunately, his revisionist approach is just as biased, trite and predictable as the one he tries to confront. Sometimes it's even worse, since all his movies are looooooong boring snorefests, where actors whisper in monotones their leftie mantras during endless scenes where nothing happens (except clichs)!

Take ""Chicogrande"", for instance: Noble Poor Peasant helps People's Hero Pancho Villa escape from Sadistic Gringo Invaders who look and talk like UNAM sociology students from the 70's trying to learn English: ""Al seyit forde las tyme: hoo-eriz Villa? S-PEEK YOO BASTARD!"" (whips the poor peasant -who, of course, remains defiantly silent).

8508037,5,B007197I6M,"Mexican intellectuals and writers are constantly re-examining their history. And for good reason, as history is always written by the victorious and many ugly truths are conveniently ignored and are subject of cover-ups. This movement was more evident during 2010, when Mexicans celebrated the bicentennial of their independence. ""Chicogrande"" takes an illuminating and riveting look at a piece of Mexican history, which involves the United States.

On March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa attacked Columbus, New Mexico. As a result, President Woodrow Wilson sent 5,000 men, under General Pershing, 600 Km into the Mexican State of Chihuahua, in what was referred to as a ""punitive expedition"" to capture Villa. We initially meet Villa (Alejandro Calva) somewhere in the mountains, his leg wounded, and in need of medical attention. He is surrounded and protected by no more than five persons. He sends Chicogrande (great Mexican actor Damian Alczar) to look for medical help in town. The town happens to be under control by Major Butch Fenton (Daniel Martinez), who is merciless and will not rest until he captures Villa. He is racist and sadistic and tortures men and women to accomplish his goal. He is also under pressure by the Carrancista Mexican army and the government to get out of Mexico. So Chicogrande has the difficult mission to get a doctor for Villa under these dangerous circumstances.

Ably written and directed by veteran Felipe Cazals, with great cinematography by Damian Garca, ""Chicogrande"" captures an interesting -- and unknown to many -- part of Mexican history, another chapter of Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa's saga. Also starring in the film are Patricia Reyes Spndola, Tenoch Huerta and Juan Manuel Bernal. This one goes for the books, for sure. (Mexico, 2010, color, 95 min).
