8437376,4,B004OZRPH8,"I don't know this opera and don't remember hearing any of the music.  The only singer in the cast I recognize is Giorgio Surian, a Croatian who I've heard sing at the Metropolitan Opera.  According to the notes in the DVD booklet this was Donizetti's fifieth opera and premiered the same year as his Lucia Di Lammermoor.  Marino Faliero was the 55th Dodge of Venice who was beheaded when he declared himself Prince.  This is strictly a park and bark opera. There simply isn't any action.  A duel is declared but takes place off stage and the chorus sings about a grand ball that you never see.  The same set is used for every scene but works quite well due to the imaginative lighting.  The costumes are very colorful and the staging is adequate. That being said we come to the music.  The overture is very thin musically but once the curtain goes up, the music keeps getting better and better with each scene.  Memorable is the Chorus of the Maids and aria of Elena, the Dodge's wife, which opens the second act.  There is also a very stirring duet between the two basses in the first act.  Most of the best music is reserved for the men.  The women are short changed musically and dramatically.  Bruno Cinquegrasi, the conductor, keeps things moving along without over powering the singers.  The running time for the opera is 152 minutes. In my estimation they could have put the entire opera on one disc and charged only $25.95 plus free shipping instead of the $41.48 price tag for two discs.  I had enough points on my Amazon/Visa card so my cost for the DVD only set me back $2.  I listened to the opera on the DTS 5.0 setting. The picture and sound was very crip and clear.  Would I recommend this DVD?  I'm a die hard opera fan and I just had to find out what Marino Faliero was all about.  I wasn't disappointed.",1314316800,9,1821,4.430722891566265
