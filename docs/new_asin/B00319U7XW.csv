8386795,2,B00319U7XW,"Pranks (or the Dorm that Dripped Blood- whatever you prefer to call this!) is a really bad horror.  The problem lies in several factors- the acting is entirely B-quality and not in a laughable or charming kind of way either.  It's getting to the point that B level horror is a considered a compliment if approached entirely for the laughs and giggles.  This is bad all around.  The character of Joanne Murray acts snotty and pretentious not necessarily because she's a college girl who desires to achieve good grades so it's only natural she'd act that way, but because the early 80's time period this movie was made demanded that younger star actors and actresses talk in such a phony way.

The story is about a group of college kids who explore an abandoned dorm building late at night and eventually everyone dies one by one, but the movie never once tries to make any of the characters enjoyable.  They're all passable in their roles, but ultimately we don't care about them because the story never gives us a reason to care.  We don't feel bad when they die.  We don't sympathize whenever the killer strikes... and when he strikes he uses really unsatisfactory means of killing his victims (usually resulting in just smacking them over the head with something generic, or cutting their arm).  This is all subpar stuff.  Even worse is that we don't see the deaths- we see the look of surprise in the victims eyes when they encounter the killer, then we briefly see an attack, and in the next scene they're lying dead on the ground.

The soundtrack is really bad too.  It relies heavily on ambient sound effects and overdramatic orchestration that jumps from loud and quiet whenever ""tension"" builds.  It's just a way to disguise weak writing as far as I see it.  Surprisingly the amount of nudity is kept to one brief scene- you'd think with a movie devoted to college kids and considering the early 80's when this movie was made, nudity would be everywhere.  With forgettable characters, weak simplistic deaths with no creativity behind them and a storyline that's been done a thousand times even back in the early 80's, it's no wonder nobody remembers the Dorm That Dripped Blood.  Even the amount of blood isn't as high as the movie title would suggest!  You'd think blood would be dripping everywhere but sadly no.  The movie does have a minor twist near the end, but it's a clich by this point.  Very very obvious.  Avoid.",1423612800,,2431,4.675294117647059
8386796,4,B00319U7XW,"This dimly lit, unassuming film may at first look like just another college slasher, but it is so much more. Good characters we actually care about, well-done dialogue, atmosphere out the ears, Pranks has it in spades. Red herrings, claustrophobia, and a cold, brilliant killer lead to an ending that will send shivers down your spine. If you want an intelligent, artistic horror movie, look no further.",1398816000,,403,5.029850746268656
8386797,4,B00319U7XW,"if you want the full uncut version, and not a s***** transfer, go with the Synapse release, and using the title ""The Dorm that Dripped Blood.""  Looks great and sounds great on blu ray.",1370217600,,184,4.411764705882353
8386798,3,B00319U7XW,"When I bought 'P R A N K S' -aka- 'The Dorm That Dripped Blood', I was expecting to witness the worst of the worst in the slasher genre.  The below average, run-of-the-mill, whodunit, 80's slasher.  I thought it would be a film that consist of one or two unoriginal kills, slow pacing, plot holes, laughable acting (which I personally enjoy), annoying music score, bad lighting, and the standard ending that most 80's slashers have.  Seriously, I thought it was going to be the typical-two-steps-below an 80's slasher like, 'Graduation Day' for example.  Well, yes, my gut instinct was MOSTLY right.  There are several unoriginal kills.  My problem is not that the kills are unoriginal, it's that when I expect to watch a B-Slasher, I want GORE.  It doesn't have to be realistic gore.  It could be cheesy gore as in '100 TEARS'-style gore.  There are only two scenes that gave me the gory goods.  Most of the kills, the camera pans away.  Also, 'PRANKS' does have somewhat of a slow pace but the parts that are slow, seem interesting to me.  However, it would seem to be in the films favor if there was a plot hole. Haha.  That's right. You heard me.  Mainly because I don't understand why the killer becomes THAT nuts!!!  It just seems out of nowhere in an uncool kinda way.  Somewhat goofy.  The acting isn't the best but again, I'm proven wrong on my prediction.  I've seen much much much worse acting than this.  Believe me.  The music score is decent.  Some of the sounds used for ""fright"" scenes worked for me.  Yes, some bad lighting is a problem but it isn't as bad as some other Horror flicks like, 'HUMONGOUS' or 'The DEMON'.  'PRANKS' just needs better treatment because this edition is copied strait from VHS.  At least it's a decent VHS copy.  Doesn't have quite the Grindhouse look. Haha.  The ending to 'PRANKS' is AWESOME!!!  This is what makes it all worthwhile.  It surprised me.  All in all, I was entertained and am glad to have it in my Horror collection.

 'PRANKS', in my opinion, is a slasher that doesn't rank up there with 'Graduation Day' or even 'Slaughter High'.  Just as 'Graduation Day' and others I've mentioned don't rank up there with other 80's slashers such as 'MANIAC' or even 'Intruder'.  'Friday the 13th' being a perfect example of being right at the top level of 80's slashers.  'PRANKS' does rank with 'Girls Night Out', 'Night School', 'Honeymoon Horror', 'The SLAYER', 'Blood Hook', and 'The PREY'(1983).  I do find 'PRANKS' to be far better than 'Don't Go in the Woods...Alone!', 'The FOREST', and 'Scalps'.  I do like 'Don't Go in the Woods...Alone! and those others i've mentioned, but for different reasons.  I hope this is a helpful way in my part by using the ""slasher grading system"".  A nutty system in my head when comparing to other 80's slashers.  I know I'm not the only one that does this.  Let's just say that if you didn't enjoy 'Prom Night' and you think that's a boring flick, than you better stay far away from 'PRANKS' and other slashers I've mentioned ranking on that same level.

I'd say you should have a wide variety of Horror in your collection because you never know what your going to be in the mood for.  Plus, your attitude towards certain Horror titles may change in time.  I actually enjoyed all of 'Don't Go in the House' for the first time tonight.  I remember not liking that one but now I love it.  But that will be another ""review"".",1266969600,12,3411,4.593023255813954
8386799,5,B00319U7XW,"I LOVE this film- with all the reviews I read before I bought the actual DVD- everyone made it sound as if the DVD quality was EXTREMELY BAD. It was in some ways a little bad- but when it first came on my tv screen I thought it would be heaps worse! Its okay for me but the dark scenes (night) are often hard to see. It is heavily cut which kinda sucks- but all in all I still love it. I wish they finally came to their senses and made a normal DVD version from a company like CODE RED or ANCHOR BAY. They should keep all the gore intact and have it as the dorm that dripped blood which sounds more appealing with full original cover art! This movie rocks and if you're a slasher fan like I and an 80s one at that, then you should love this film! CHEESY at times and ""different"" acting but good. If you ever come across this on video BUY IT it'll be uncut and great! If you even find a DVD R uncut version then BUY THAT as well. However I still do recommend this to everyone. I loved it heaps!",1265068800,10,993,3.945273631840796
8386800,2,B00319U7XW,"This is an ok low-budget slasher from the early eighties which takes place in an abandoned dorm building, has who-done-it plot, and co-stars Daphne Zuniga from The Initiation, Space Balls and Sure Thing, and also has some good, bloody deaths! Only problem is the good stuff is cut and the only way you can see this cheese fully un- cut & un-censored,, you'll have to stick with the  VHS WHICH IS UNCUT !!!",1252713600,4,405,4.5479452054794525
8386801,5,B00319U7XW,"This is my 2nd Favourite College Slasher besides ""House On SOrority Row"". Impressive Gore, creative dath scenes and an early performance by Dathne Zuniga!",1128643200,4,154,5.458333333333333
8386802,4,B00319U7XW,"Another 80's college film in which all the ""students"" look older than expected.  College girl Joanne Murray takes on the unenviable job of readying the student housing building to become apartments, which includes selling the unneeded furniture, etc.  This takes place during a break, so a mysterious psycho is stalking the nearly-empty premises on campus.  Need more?
Who's the killer?  Is it weirdo John Hemmit from Room 25, an older resident of the dorm with a fuzzy Bozo-the clown balding head?  He's played by ""Woody Roll,""  by the way.  Or is it jeans-jacket wearing redneck Bobby Lee, who hits on our heroine?  Watch it and see.
As you can imagine, this is typical slasher stuff, with overly dramatic music that sounds ripped off from ""Psycho.""  Don't expect anything earth-shattering; you do get a cheapie, yet solid release for fans of 80's slasher/horror.  No real extras on the DVD, however, save a biography of supporting actress Daphne Zuniga in her film debut, amazingly she went on to 80's moneymakers like The Sure Thing, VisionQuest and Spaceballs.  After that...Toxic Avenger 3, anyone???
It's not like the grainy print is retouched or anything...who's gonna bother? 80's horror fanatics will still love this cheesefest that was like a poor man's ""Pieces??""  I don't know, it's not as gory and weird as Pieces, but it's in that same mindless yet fun stalk n' slash vein....
Expect a low budget, some bad acting, and if those are things you are able to tolerate then Pranks ain't half bad.  Best served with lots of beer and a roomful of friends.",1082937600,12,1563,4.897338403041825
