Wallander isn't a who-done-it film. Instead, it is the film about a person who is doing a job that is required by society, is done by few people, in reality, and is actually pretty horrific.... It is The Story of Wallander, and it is done very, very well. Try it.",1476403200,2,411,4.35064935064935

3595033,5,B001G3ENM6,"We liked it, but not as much as the Swedish versions(s).  Sometimes it gets a little melodramatic.  My own scandinavian descent tells me that their humor can be a little deadpan, the Swedish Kurt Wallander, could say a lot with a look that was skeptical with wit.  The Swedish has humor in it here and there.  Kenneth Branagh is a great actor and his work carries the show.  The music is great too.",1464912000,,398,4.397260273972603

3595035,4,B001G3ENM6,"Very good writing, acting and direction. Episodes are self-contained with a little overlap of characters for continuity. Of greatest enjoyment is the attention to details such as gestures of hands. This close-focus filming enhances the notion of intimacy and the psychological shifts of the lead characters. In contrast to that are the distant overhead shots of expansive landscape. The relationship of father to son, father to his art, son to his work and daughter to father are complex. Tom Hiddleston is great...a star in the making.",1464480000,2,536,5.244186046511628

3595063,2,B001G3ENM6,"This series was not entertaining. I actually wished that one of the evil doers would kill Wallender just to put him out of his misery. Really, really awful. The Mankell source material is exceptional, Ystad is scenically breathtaking and Wallender is played by Kenneth Branagh; so what happened?
 This BBC version of Wallender is awful, I can't say it enough. Wallender, as played by Branagh, is an ineffectual dolt. As evidenced by his detective abilities, I can not see how he rose above the rank of traffic constable. It is painful to watch him bumbling about, putting himself, his colleagues and untold innocents in the line of fire.
  Branagh certainly does a lot of acting, from hand-wringing angst all the way to righteous zeal. He cries, he pouts and he shouts. Ugh. Branagh is the biggest problem with this production. As a viewer, I was painfully aware that he is constantly acting, he never becomes the character and it is uncomfortable watching him thrashing and gasping about like a huge Flounder fish.
This Wallender series is not recommended.",1455580800,3,1057,4.926966292134831

3595088,5,B001G3ENM6,Outstanding. I watched all of the Branagh series then all the others in Swedish. I was surprised at the number of murders in Sweden.,1444521600,,132,4.541666666666667
3595089,5,B001G3ENM6,"Who knew?  I didn't know: that Henning Mankell is currently the most popular Swedish novelist, having produced about 11 crime fiction books centered on the fictional detective Kurt Wallander.  That they have sold 25 million or more copies in some 20 languages.  That they were more popular in Germany than the Harry Potter series?  Or that the BBC and the actor Kenneth Brannagh made a first series in 2008 based on 3 of the novels?  That, as usual, the BBC managed to best any American TV hands-down with this mini-series, which was brought to the US courtesy WGBH Boston, Masterpiece Theatre and Warner Brothers?  That although all the dialog in this series is in English [and very understandable to an American audience at that], it really was filmed in Sweden?  That Kenneth Brannagh read all the novels and loved them?  Best of all: that so far there is a second and a third and a 4th series?  Sadly, Mankell apparently passed away just 2 days ago, so additional series certainly will be limited.

I didn't really know Brannagh before I watched this series.  All of the acting is good and his is superb.  His Wallander is perfect [as far as I can tell].  Interestingly the signs you see on the streets and in stores and newspapers are all in Swedish (since it was filmed in Sweden, as I mentioned) but the dialog is English.  But more interesting: they managed to throw in a few strictly British idioms, which are probably just as unfamiliar to the Swedes as they initially were to me [not hard to understand really, once you get used to them].

The Sweden which is the setting for the stories is a somewhat-troubled paradise.  For decades it had the highest average standard of living of any country in the world.  A land of beautiful lakes, forests, mountains, flower beds, and women.  A land of tolerance.  A land which hasn't been involved in war in 150 years.  The oldest continuous nation in Europe.  Yet just south of it are the seething Baltics, and also nearby is Denmark, also viewed with some suspicion.  Theres been some increase in alcohol and drug abuse, less-idyllic rural areas, and a growing suspicion of immigrants, as in the rest of Europe.  Now drop into this land of contrasts a lad whose mother deserts the family when he is six.  His father, from a long line of musicians, has to abandon his first vocation as it is insufficient for a single parent.  Instead he takes up the law and becomes judge in a rural town.  The family live upstairs from the courthouse.  So at an early age Mankell is exposed to the difficulty of a broken home and then intimate familiarity with the world of crime and the legal system.  Some time before puberty he reads the Swedish version of The Old Man and The Sea.  He is so smitten with it that from then on he resolves to be a writer himself.  Age 15: he meets his real mother.  He finds he had constructed a mother in his imagination, and when he met the real person, abruptly realized that he preferred the imaginary mother to the real one.  Impact: a dramatic example of the power of imagination in mental life.  Now it is not hard to understand some of the origins for his engaging detective novels.  His wife is the daughter of Ingmar Bergman.  Perhaps that explains some of the visual power of the novels, which is certainly present in the series.

The most I will say about season one is this: this is no Law & Order series.  This is genuine art, using as its particular subject detective stories, and its medium, film and television.  I find the cinematography in particular to be superb.  I give this an A.  I recommend it to anyone age 15 or older.",1444176000,,3617,4.547286821705426

3595092,5,B001G3ENM6,"Branagh's ability fully to occupy a character is on ample display in Wallander.

Given the competition, such quality is a high accomplishment indeed.",1439251200,,403,5.483870967741935
3595093,5,B001G3ENM6,"I bought this after checking it out the other two seasons from the public library. There is not a set formula that is followed, so there is an element of surprise with each story. Wallander is not an invincible superhero.  He is a regular guy who is good at his job. He is vulnerable, he makes mistakes, he often looks rumpled, and he suffers real consequences from bad choices.  The themes presented in each episode are often difficult and sometimes brutal and so I would use caution in watching it with children. I am intrigued by the exploration of Wallanders relationships with othershis father, his daughter, his coworkers. I like this series because I prefer to watch shows that give me something to think about after they end and this series provides a lot of material to contemplate.

Branagh really nails the character, but surely even he gets depressed by him?  Find I can't watch more than two at a time without switching out to something more cheerful for a break.

3595101,1,B001G3ENM6,"This series has so many flaws I don't know where to start.
It is mystifying why Bramah even took on this project when the Swedish Wallander series is so right and seamless and flowing; it is a pleasure to watch.
But the Branagh series
1) seems to have put itself through a Swedish strainer -- there is nothing recognizably Swedish about it.
2) The directing is very poor. With many speeches the actions don't jibe.. Two people are waiting for a missing woman and are in her house without permission. They would be expected to be a bit tense and to both turn quickly when the door opens noisely behind them. Branagh turns, slowly, but the woman with him takes a couple of beats before turning around.
3) Why is Branagh so frequently speaking in low, almost - whispers?  And there is a blond woman with him, maybe an assistant, who speaks in whispers too. It is supremely annoying! Why direct in this way?
4) Branagh doesn't seem to know who he is as Wallander.
I tried watching this with an open mind, twice, with years in between.. I was ready to appreciate Branagh as a new, interesting character. But he didn't have a cohesive grasp of it. He couldn't be more bland in his choices.

5) So much about the directing doesn't compute. At one point 'Wallander' is seen creeping up, with a gun, on a suspect ' s house when, suddenly, 3 swat team guys rush up, guns blazing, windows shatter, and Wallander, shouting at them to stop, ultimately treats this violent intrusion much the way he would treat the annoyance of a sudden swooping flock of birds. There is no explanation for this cartoon - like interruption, and no discussion about it ensues. The scene changes and we move on.

I tried to watch two episodes, got through half of each and said 'Bleah! ' I hate it and won't try again. It is a waste of my time.",1428710400,,1811,4.448795180722891

3595104,4,B001G3ENM6,"I watched entire Swedish Wallander series and both are excellent film. In many ways I prefer this series with more suspense and sudden twists of plot. My only complaint, and I have this with many, many Brit films made in the past 20 years, is a reliance on pissed-off secondary characters. People respond in so many more ways to tragedies - and these stories do remind me of Greek tragedies. Yet in each episode, I can now count on accusations and angst from every friend and relative of the murdered. What's up with that view of life, Brits? Very tedious after a while. But perhaps Americans are more stoic. Or suppressed. Or more civil?  I'm not sure that I've ever seen anyone respond to death, and I've seen lots of violent desth, in that churlish way these characters do.

3595128,4,B001G3ENM6,"Well tried (done)! I have been sitting here reading the 1 stars shaking my head in disdane! I never write reviews (yes, another one) But I stand FIRM on the attempt. the cinematography was superb, Henning Mankell was ON SET as they filmed these to bring it to a wider audience. In Euro this author is more popular than J.K. Rowling. Why? Exactly what you complained about. He is imperfect, drinks too much at first, had heart problems can be depressed and me to his colleagues. Have ANY of you experienced a bad day? Well Kurt is going through Divorce, His Daughter is actually much more complicated and his father will be slowly dying. Well with that and work I would say; That's a pretty full plate. Branagh Does play him differently, frankly, he plays Branagh, Long pauses and sighs at times (I keep waiting for a soliloquy -To be.....or Not...you get the idea) he does fine for UK/US Now my BIGGEST PROBLEM is Hiddleston (sp) season 1 after goes poof! if you watch the real Swedish version, it shows the Entire Thread! and why he 'actually' disappears. It was unreal how it was never explained! You need to see the Swedish first to understand the (BIG SPOILER) child porn epi. AFTER watching those only then can you really enjoy the UK versions. Is that bad? No, not really because each episode stands alone. You just need to understand who Kurt is, he's an ""evreyman"". So don't go looking for slick stylish can't possibly be true Sherlock (though that is #2 fave to Doctor who series 1-7). Just my IMO b/c I felt Kurt need to be explained and defended.",1421452800,,1557,4.564285714285714

3595232,2,B001G3ENM6,"The first episode in this series featured a good mystery, decent performances, fine production values and was beautifully filmed, but way too much footage was devoted to detective Wallander's tortured existence.  Crime books, films and TV shows can be enriched by exploration of the leading character's personal history, but to be true to my expectations for the genre, the investigation of the mystery and its solution must come first.  In this show I felt the crime story was subordinated to the character study, rendering it less than gripping.  In fact, my husband dozed off about 20 minutes into the episode.  We won't be watching any more of this series.  The quality of the HD stream to an Ethernet connected Roku was excellent.",1418860800,,735,4.991803278688525

3595312,4,B001G3ENM6,"It's an interesting approach on how to adapt a foreign series to your own country. Rather than moving from the original Swedish setting to Britain, they instead took a British cast to Sweden. Only the dialogue is in English.

I've been watching the Swedish version (the one with Krister Henriksson) and while I'm leaning more to Henrisson's portrayal of Kurt Wallander, Kenneth Branagh is very good, but on the other hand Henriksson had some 32 episodes with which to develop his character. Like many British cop shows, the pacing can strike some as slow (compared to American TV), but stick with it and you'll find yourself thoroughly engaged.

One thing that makes this worth viewing, even if you don't like detective/crime shows, is that the photography is absolutely stunning. The BBC used a newer digital system for imaging this series, and I don't think I've ever seen a TV show where the picture has such range and depth in both the reproduction of color and the resolution. If you have a good HDTV, and don't have Amazon Prime, spend the extra couple of bucks for the high definition version.

Wallander is not your typical detective story.  The length od=f the episodes are long enough to develop the story and characters.  There are twists that keep it interesting.

3595333,4,B001G3ENM6,"I have watched all three shows in the first season.

The two stars are Kenneth Branagh, who is extraordinary, as always; and Sweden.

The plots are a bit uneven, and don't have the cool hard logic of the best crime/detective novels. And, the unrelenting British accents of everyone in the casts of all three shows I have seen so far seems a bit odd considering the stories are about Swedes in Sweden.

But don't let that dissuade you.  If you are looking for a good (not great) hour and a half long mystery/character study/virtual trip to Sweden, try this series.",1415836800,,563,4.6

3595360,5,B001G3ENM6,"Branagh is an amazing actor - so versatile and talented.  But his character, Wallander, simply cannot catch a break.  It gets worse for him in following seasons.  By season 3, epi 1, I was chuckling at the epi description.  Conflict and disaster make good roles for actors like Branagh, and he convinces me every episode.  But if Wallander has any more really bad luck, the character won't be believable unless he's drooling in an institution somewhere.  I'd love for Branagh to break out in a Gilderoy Lockheart smile, but Wallander hasn't got much to smile about, poor guy - he's a train wreck - morbidly fascinating so that you find you can't look away.  This series is well worth watching, if only to see a superior actor once again excel in his craft.",1413072000,,756,4.639097744360902

8303692,3,B001G3ENM6,"Noting first, that this is a British remake of a successful Swedish series.  Noting second, that I like British procedurals as a rule.  That said, I think this series rates fair at best.  Though Branagn has his admiers, I found his performance here to be lacking.  As Brit procedual fans, we all love our tortured detectives with baggage.  In this though, Branagh was simply self involved to the point of being narcissitic.  Some excuse was provided in the reveal of Branagh as a type 2 diabetic, but, otherwise, his performamce is as a classic, stumbling, functional alcoholic.  He also over-exaggerates, a common trait of stage actors.  Perhaps most damning, there is pitiful use of the seemimgly competent ensamble cast.  Tone down the lead, tune up the supprting cast, and you could have a hit series here.  As it is, it's a quick watch and forget, if at all.",1508371200,,863,4.77027027027027
8303693,5,B001G3ENM6,"Wallander is a British television series adapted from the detective novels of the acclaimed Swedish crime author Henning Mankell. Wallander is essentially a combination of a detective procedural and a personal drama, the first iteration of which is a Swedish language version with English subtitles. The story line is centered around Kurt Wallander, who is depicted as a tired and troubled veteran Swedish homicide detective, whose personal life is totally dysfunctional, and who seems to be suffering from elements of severe job stress, burnout, and PTSD. He has recently separated from his wife, and he has a complicated relationship with his adult daughter, who often comes across as the supervisory parent, rather than the child, in her interactions with her father. Although Kurt Wallander usually looks scruffy and disheveled, and often displays an extremely volatile demeanor, his unkempt appearance and his obvious emotional distress belie his exceptional investigative skills and acumen. When he is able to focus, Kurt Wallander is a masterful detective, who is hyper-observant, systematic, and methodical, with an uncanny ability to solve complex homicide cases. Wallander is characterized by excellent writing and plot development, with murder mysteries that are exceedingly intriguing, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. Kenneth Branagh delivers an absolutely outstanding performance with his brilliant portrayal of Detective Kurt Wallander, and the acting performances of the supporting cast are also stellar. Wallander is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining detective series from BBC America, which certainly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1499644800,4,1738,5.900793650793651
8303694,3,B001G3ENM6,"The shows were good, not great.  I'd watch Season two because it's better than network tv, but Very disappointed that there are only three shows in a season.  I should have looked closer.  Other series have twice the number for a similar price.  I may purchase the next season--but not right now.  Too much other good stuff online.",1497830400,,331,4.637931034482759

8303697,5,B001G3ENM6,"I read all of Henning Mankell's detective novels and enjoyed them very much. Usually, as most people know, the film versions are not as good because the time available does not allow the same depth as contained in the books. This is by necessity true also of the Mankell novels. However, that said, the films are still great, and Kenneth Branagh, one of the great actors out, captures the character of the head detective and with the writers of the script, gives the stories depth. It is a pleasure to watch this series. While there are a limited number of plots involving crimes, the series is done in an attention grabbing manner.",1486684800,,632,4.651785714285714
