7906123,5,B00000F0JZ,"Jeff Fahey is one of the 80s and 90s most underrated actors. This 1991 mystery has been one of our favorites, but we never saw it for sale. When we found it at Amazon we just had to have it. Fahey and Bridget Fonda are very good in this movie considering it's slow and at times corny script.",1371945600,,291,4.0344827586206895
7906124,3,B00000F0JZ,"The time - the late 80s.
The place - a Pennsylvania steel town in the grips of a recession.
Against this less-than-pleasant backdrop is set a story of jealousy and violence. Who did what to who? Why did who do what to who? Who is telling the truth about what who did what to who and why who did what to who?
Although this movie should have been good, it comes across as mediocre. The acting is so-so, some sections of the movie seem to wander, it leaves you with the feeling that it should have been better.
Ah well, that's show business!!!",1007596800,7,540,4.252427184466019
