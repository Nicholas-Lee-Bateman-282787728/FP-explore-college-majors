1707084,5,B000065AYU,"Well I had already seen the the three episodes in the subbed form, and found that these were sort of the slow point in the series.  The first part with Naru becoming a pop star had some good music in it, will be interested to see what the english version has.  The second episode with Su turning in to her adult version when the red moon is out is rather entertaining, and you get to meet her older sister and her white alligator.  The third episode with Motoko trying to act like a girl was entertaining just because of the premise.  The fourth one with the giant turtle that Su built was good in just watching Motoko's reaction to it.  Most of the episodes (except the second one with Su) are not really needed to be viewed to understand the whole story, but they are still entertaining.  The english still sucks, but it sort of builds on you over time, or you just get numb to it.",1024876800,3,883,4.25748502994012
1707085,3,B000065AYU,"Love Hina is a good anime. But, this DVD is not so good. For one, the dub voices are all wrong. Urashima sounds like he's holding his nose. Su-chan sounds like she's indonesian when clearly she's an alien. Mutsumi doesn't have that soft voice. And Motoko doesn't scream the same way. Anyway, the first time I saw these certain episodes it was really cool. However, I'm gonna have to say that I am passing on this DVD and waiting for the 4th one to come out. Sara and Seta show up then!",1023753600,2,485,4.282608695652174
7960803,5,B000065AYU,"I'm a huge collector of anime. I started to read the manga a few years ago and got hooked. Unfortunately Suncoast went under years ago, so I couldn't buy the discs from them. Our blockbuster also went under, so I couldn't go and see if they had it for cheap, and everywhere else that I looked would've charged $29.99/disc--providing that they even had individual and not box-set of it... Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,784,4.451388888888889
7960804,5,B000065AYU,Wow after viewing the dvds so far I personally like this one. This dvd introduces a new character. Turns out that Kaolla has a older sister and she is even crazier than kaolla. Naru becomes a pop star in this dvd and the music that she sings is just awesome. I just love the two songs that she sings and I would personally recommend finding those two songs on your own. Aside from that this dvd was well worth the price of getting!!!,1116201600,,433,4.228915662650603
7960805,5,B000065AYU,"Love Hina volume 3-
The missing rent money, Kaolla Su's adult form, The new popstar--Naru, and Motoko in feminine clothes! Cotains episodes 9-12, both subbed and dubbed (Also cotains an interview with the director)
Highly recommended if you enjoyed the first two discs.",1086566400,,269,5.27906976744186
7960806,5,B000065AYU,"The rent money has disappeared, a mysterious woman who looks like an older verison of Kaolla is running about at night (with a alligator), Naru may become a Pop-Idol and Motoko is dressing up in normal outfits for once!
Who took the money?  Who is the woman and how is she linked to Kaolla?  Will Naru become rich and famous and leave the apartments?  Will Motoko ever find her pride again?
Add a giant robot, that looks like a turtle, Kitsune dressed up like Sherlock Holmes, and lots of extras and what you have is a great DVD!",1079136000,,529,4.377551020408164
7960807,5,B000065AYU,"This disc starts off kind of bad. The first episode really isn't very good, and I wasn't particularly interested by it. However, the second episode is easily one of my favorites. When the moon turns red, Kaolla transforms into an older version of herself. Kaolla's sister, Amalla Su, shows up at Hinata Hot Springs to deal with her little sister's transformation by getting rid of the man who is causing it: Keitaro! (he reminds Kaolla of her older brother) Amalla Su has a white alligator named Shiro as a pet. Yes, you heard me, she has a white alligator!
The third episode has Naru becoming an idol singer (and she sings a nice song in the episode). Sure, it's wierd when you watch an English dub and the singing is still Japanese, but at least the songs are there even in the English version
The last episode has everyone learn that Motoko is afraid of turtles, including the resident flying and talking Tama. This leads ultimately to a giant robot turtle attacking the Hinata Apartments.
These are mostly filler episodes, but entertaining nonetheless. If for nothing else, buy this for the Red Moon Kaolla episode!",1041552000,3,1119,4.743589743589744
7960808,5,B000065AYU,"In episode 9, Keitaro, the manager of the Hinata Inn has all of his money in a little case. When he comes back to his room, the money is gone! So, Kitsune and Su start seeing who the thief was, but it was nobody at the Hinata Inn. Then, Kitsune says she did. And she has a very clever way, too. To find out who she did it, buy this DVD! In episode 10, Everytime the red moon comes out, there's a mysterious woman with an alligator. Kentaro Sakata is going to give flowers to Naru, but on his way, he discovers the girl, and gives them to her instead. She refuses the flowers, and her alligator beats him up. We discover that Kaolla Su turns into an adult version of herself when the red moon is out. Kentaro says that that girl is Su, but she is not. Instead, she is Su's sister, Amalla Su. She wants Su to come back with her, but Su refuses. This is also another one of my favorite episodes. In episode 11, Naru becomes a pop-star. She gets tired of singing, so she decides to go back to her normal life. In episode 12, Motoko's clothes have been washed, and she has nothing to wear. So, she ends up wearing girl clothes, which she does not like. That episode was really cute!",1041120000,,1177,4.14410480349345
7960809,5,B000065AYU,"This is another hilarious Love Hina adventure
In the first episode the rent money ends up disappearing and Kitsune ends up attempting to find it, in the meanwhile Naru ends up getting accused of it while trying to hide something that was in her room that she lost (something from DVD 2 :)) and trying to make sure nowone sees
In the second episode Kaolla transforms to an adult form and ""stalks"" Keitaro, and her sister Amalla, comes for a visit, providing some humorous moments...
In the third episode Naru becomes a pop star idol with Kentaro as her manager, she enjoys it for a while untill Keitrao reminds her of some things...
The fourth episode is hilarious, Motoko ends up having to dress feminine, and in the process, ends up inadvertantly attracting men to her (something she disapproves of) until she (reluctantly) has to ask Keitaro for a favor so she will be left alone by men :)
Overall its a good DVD, if your already this far into the series, don't stop it only gets better :)",1038096000,,991,4.5418994413407825
7960810,5,B000065AYU,"The first episodes were awesome, but then it diverges from the main plot with a series of episodes full of wild antics having little to do with the main story. If you bare with these the last episodes are even better than the first, and the two specials are absolutely amazing. And when someone releases Love Hina Again, the OVA, in America and one gets to watch those, one can't argue against Love Hina being one of the top 10, if not 5 greatest anime of all time.",1026172800,4,465,4.295454545454546
7960811,3,B000065AYU,"Volume 1 remains the high point of the series, and although this volume is better than volume 2, it is still too dopey. The redeeming  aspects of this anime derive from the charming characters, and in this volume we do get treated to some interesting character development despite the silly plots. I like the dub, even if the voices do not match the Japanese very well--if Shakespeare can withstand different voice treatments, why not an anime?  Now if Shakespeare were only available to consult on the plots we'd really have something.",1025568000,2,536,4.8791208791208796
7960812,4,B000065AYU,"Part 3 in the Love Hina series...it's still funny, but the story can get a bit silly. This release shows the Hinata turtle flying, a tame alligator named Shiro, a giant metal turtle that tries to eat the apartments, and magical girls transformations.
We see that Kitsune is a prankster. The relationship between Keitaro and Naru grows with Keitaro voicing his feeling outright and Naru showing that she likes having him around. Su's background is covered vaguely as her sister arrives in town and we learn that Su left her homeland to get away from something. We learn that Naru can sing. Motoko learns that her ""chi"" (inner strength) is only defeated by her own fears.
Unfortunately, the english dub is still the achilles heel. (I'd stick to the Japanese track and use subtitles.) Other than that, this installment was not a disappointment. It ties into the previous episodes, and it still brings out a laugh.",1025049600,8,910,4.839743589743589
