  This DVD presents an up-close look at the mobster who lived his life at nothing short of full-throttle. Examine Siegel's greatest lagacy as the founding father of glittering Las Vegas,Nevada.

Having traveled to Las Vegas during the 70's 80's 90's I am very interested in the history of the town.

  Bugsy Siegel played a major roll in developing Las Vegas to what it has become today.

  I viewed part of this movie on one of the cable channels and decided tom purchase a copy.

  I search the net to found the best price and delivery at Amazon and purchase a copy for my home library.
