There is a Japanese DVD but I'm pretty sure it has no subtitles.  Too bad, this movie could use a wider audience.",1359331200,,253,4.319148936170213
7846859,5,6303435572,"This movie captured so much of the joys and hardships of a real family man trying to serve his company, wife and children, and parents, in modern Japan.  Having lived in Japan for a bit, it seemed quite on the mark.  The frustrating moments were often quite hysterically funny, sometimes quite painful.  A wonderful movie, even for  someone with no Japan background, capturing the struggles and joys of trying to be a man with heart.",975715200,4,433,4.733333333333333
