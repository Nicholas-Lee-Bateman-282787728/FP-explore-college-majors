8061399,1,B0009IWGD2,"SELDOM DO I SEE SUCH A DEPRESSING PRESENTATION.
Nearly everyone featured is morbidly obese and
seemingly devoid of ideas for living normally.

Particularly terrible are opening and closing scenes showing fat old-acting ugly obese folks traveling around in so-called RVs towing another vehicle behind. After driving their very expensive monster-sized gas-guzzling gigantic bus around  and staying in ""RV Parks"" with others like them. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! The food shown in the film is VERY unhealthy - ideally suited to getting and staying fat and sick. A woman tells us about her quadruple-bypass husband with no mention that he caused this himself by eating like the others in the film. Give me a break!",1318982400,,701,5.1946902654867255
8061400,5,B0009IWGD2,"I bought this on a friend's recommendation, and have just seen it. The comments from different people who are about to leave a job after many years, and comments from others who are active now in new ways after leaving jobs(some say that the word ""retirement"" is not in their vocabulary) - are interesting. I especially liked seeing Mort Walker, who draws the ""Beetle Bailey"" cartoons - he's 80, and still lively, active, and humorous. The only negative comment I'd have is the price tag for a one hour DVD. A bit high.",1154995200,10,519,4.591397849462366
