8331281,1,B001OSC4CY,"I saw the original movie on VHS and thought it was really hot.
Great scenes with lots-o-nudity.
Got the DVD.
WHERE ARE THOSE SCENES?
Rip off.
Don't get this DVD if you liked the scenes from the original VHS, because THEY AREN'T THERE!

8331282,1,B001OSC4CY,"I'm a huge fan of ""Fugitive Girls"" (aka ""Five Loose Women"") and have anxiously awaited the DVD release for ten years or more. While this DVD is superior in audio and video quality to the multiple VHS versions I own, it is missing a total of five minutes! The sex scenes are cut down to nothing, which is a real shame because they contain some magnificently cheesy dialog and acting, and their absence really takes away from the powerfully trashy experience that is ""Fugitive Girls"". It is likely that the best-looking source print this company was able to find was missing these scenes, but I would have liked them to say so somewhere on the DVD. It's a rip-off.",1243555200,21,662,4.571428571428571
