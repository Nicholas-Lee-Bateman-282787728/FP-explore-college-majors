7910662,3,B00000ILBW,"After watching the first two chapters of this series, I was looking forward to this third one, but although it was pretty good, the story lines just couldn't compare with the episodes from the first two tapes.
The banter among the characters was still good, and there were some good lines, and the potential was still there, but it just wasn't fully realized this time.  Unfortunately, that's what sometimes happens in a series, the middle episodes sometimes start to bog down the series as the writers struggle to keep the storylines fresh.  Still, there is hope, and I'm optimistic about seeing the next episodes, and hoping that they can pick the pace back up.
The first story on this tape, while having a slight charm, doesn't really explain enough about what's going on.  Some cat like spirit, we are told, is possessing stuffed animals, and slowly destroying a town, although not maliciously.  How or where this spirit came from is never explained, and what was going to happen, and where it was going to finally end up was just too much of a dead giveaway.  I had it figured out about ten minutes into the episode, which really isn't a good thing.  The second episode was a bit better, at least it finally explained just how the trio managed to end up in this parallel world where magic and elves exist.  I thought it got just a little too mean spirited though, where the elf is set afloat down the river, tied naked to a log.  That's only my opinion though, you may want to check the video out and see for yourself.
Still, I look forward to the next volume, and hope that the lightheartedness of the earlier episodes comes back.",972432000,,1636,4.578767123287672
7910663,5,B00000ILBW,If you think The Slayers was funny then you will think Those Who Hunt Elves is funny. I rented this from the video store last week and it was the best anime I ever seen it has action comedy and much more. In other words  buy this tape because this maybe the best anime ever made.,960681600,,279,3.982142857142857
7910664,4,B00000ILBW,"Those Who Hunt Elves is not for everyone. This is extremely obvious from the first moment it appears on the screen, but I thought I'd like to make  that clear for those who haven't seen it. However. For people who want to  watch something that gives up characterization and plotline for gags and  goofball humor, I would really highly recommend this series. I've only seen  as far as this volume so far, but I'm eagerly waiting until I can get  volume 4.
I would like to note, though, that I very much prefer the  subtitled version of this series. It has some of my absolute favorite voice  actors from different anime series - such as Tomizawa Michie (Sailor Mars  from Sailor Moon) as Airi, Mitsuishi Kotono (Sailor Moon from...well...duh)  as Celcia, and Seki Tomokazu (Chichiri from Fushigi Yuugi) as Junpei. This  series is quite a treat, if you just want to giggle.",960595200,,871,4.671052631578948
