7878630,4,6304852673,"For a wild action film, First Option features unusually accurate tactics and weapons-handling.  This is likely due to the real-life SDU members consulting on the picture.  Also, unlike John Woo and his other famous Hong Kong contemporaries, director Gordon Chan has always leaned towards authenticity in his action scenes.  You can see the pinnacle of this approach in ""2000 AD"", a more recent Chan film that features stunning shootouts.  But First Option is certainly an action-packed film as well.  Definitely a must-see for fans of military/specops movies.
One note about the casual wear outfits: They are realistic.  If you ever bother to research beyond glossy promotional photos, you'll see that real military and SWAT units can and do often wear civilian clothing during operations.  Whatever works best for the situation.  That's the whole point of these unconventional units!  In this case, they're operating in a tropical, urban environment.  Jeans & t-shirt are comfortable, sturdy, inconspicuous and a lot more appropriate in the heat than full hooded flame resistant jumpsuits.  And they are not missing any of their important gear (assault vests, pouches, holsters, weapons, etc).  It's funny that when a film tries to be LESS flashy and movielike that it gets accused for being unrealistic!
As for the SEALs being beaten in the film, I disagree that they were beaten ""easily"".  In fact, they defeat the SDU at one point and there's a scene where the SDU discuss the fearsome reputation of the SEALs.  When the SDU finally triumph, it's far from ""easy"".  But last I checked, no training in the world makes men bulletproof.  Just because the SEALs have a superhuman reputation, you shouldn't start believing that only kryptonite can bring them down.  The ultimate triumph of the SDU is quite reasonable given the way the scenarios are set up in this film.",1018137600,2,1868,5.092105263157895

Your beloved SEALS wore them in Vietnam.  Swat teams and special units need to be big.  That is not in the least bit unlikely.  SEALs are probably the best at DA (direct action).  They are young, tough and pumped full of macho Hooyah ism.  However, against a trained numerically superior force they would be forced to evade or be over run.  And they really didn't do all that bad.  They caused more cassualties than they took.
Most unlrealist thing was the size of the seals.  Being that big and pure muscle you sink like a ruck.  Seals a buff, but they are built for endurance along with strength.
In the end this a a movie, the CQB was well done and alot of things were technically correct.  However this is a movie.",981849600,2,865,4.33125
7878632,1,6304852673,"I rented this movie basically because of the flashy box cover with the elite units on the cover with their masks and HK's. This movie is not what  i expected. I thought this movie to be fake and unreal. I also thought that  the dubbing on this film was extreamly horrible. The story is about ex Navy  Seals who turn drug running and the Flying Tigers must stop them. The movie  had plenty of shoot outs with plenty of neat firearms to show but doesn't  make up for the rest. The tigers got a gang of guys running around shooting  things. The seals die like their nothing and its just funny to me how a  bunch of guys running in jeans with guns can kill off some ex navy seals so  easily. The tigers come with plenty of soldiers wearing their masks, vest,  and weilding their HK sub-machine guns while in their jeans. What kind of  SDU (Special Duties Unit) would come with about 20-25 guys and some with  their jeans on? Most tactical units come with limited number of people who  wear better gear and more trained to handle the job unoticed. The seals are  also one of the most highly trained Special Force in the world so how would  they die so fast. The tactics are weak and some of the acting is shallow.  The only reason this film got a star at all was because of the shoot outs  and all the flashy weaponary. If you really want to see some Hong Kong  action movies rent some John Woo films other than that stay clear of this  film and for the price stay far far away.",966816000,,1473,4.218637992831542
7878633,4,6304852673,"First Option is a much larger-scaled prequel (actually, even the term ""prequel"" is used loosely here, the only real connections between the films being the Michael Wong character, here called ""Don"",  and sidekick ""Joe"".) that ups the ante on the action sequences  but isn't as nuanced an exploration of life in Hong Kong's elite police  SDU.  Nevertheless, First Option contains more than enough character depth,  tension, and expert pacing to rank among the best films ever made in Hong  Kong.
This story focuses much more on the Michael Wong character.  He is  once again physical, edgy, and charismatic, a beefier and less romantic  version of Chow Yun-fat, if you will (and English-speaking, for the most  part).  Gigi Leung does well as the pseudo romantic interest.  Director  Gordon Chan, the John McTiernan of Hong Kong, is again the master of pacing  and dialogue, his lines ringing out crisp and intense, and his eye for  detail in action sequences intoxicating.  The only dud in the writing  department is the final exchange between ""Rick"" and  ""Don"" -- sounds like a rhyming game or something!  Small dent in  an action-film masterpiece that keeps things moving and respects its  characters.",957484800,2,1203,5.066666666666666
