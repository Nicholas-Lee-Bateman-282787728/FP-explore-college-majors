8002225,3,B0000EMYBM,It's an ok performance. I've seen better by Busta. If your a fan of Busta then get it! Lot of cursing!,1360368000,,102,3.9047619047619047
8002226,5,B0000EMYBM,"I've been a fan of Busta Bust since the Leaders of the New School days. I've purchased basically all CDs Busta Rhymes has put out throughout the years. Made it a point to get tickets to each concert Busta would be apart of when performing in California. I've seen clips and short performance video in documentaries or other musical artists videos or dvds but did not know Busta Rhymes had a concert DVD of his own. Once I found this.....Sh*t I had to make this purchase and I could not be in anyway shape or form disappointed. To view Busta in concert live is no comparison but a good piece of musical history to have at home and add to anyone's musical DVD collection. Busta has done alot more since 2004, so I'm looking forward to the next DVD to be released of his current contributions to add to my collection. Enjoy the DVD but make it a point to go watch Busta perform live in concert. Definitely worth the admission price.",1348444800,2,929,4.406976744186046
8002227,5,B0000EMYBM,"Are you kidding me? This was on sale for under 2 bucks and it's the quintessential Busta Rhymes dvd. Great performance with Spliff, comes highly recommended!",1328918400,,157,5.076923076923077
8002228,4,B0000EMYBM,"This is Busta Rhymes's one and only Live DVD, giving a solid concert performance in 2003 in Phoenix, Arizona. As a rapper at the mainstream level, Busta Rhymes has impressively established himself as one of the best MCs out there with 6 studio albums under his belt and many classic hits. His unique voice and style makes him a thrill to listen to, and this concert shows him flying through old hits while also performing the material from his latest album alongside Flipmode man Spliff Star. His best performances include a nice, shortened performance of ""Tear Da Roof Off"", ""Woo Ha! (Got You All in Check)"", ""Gimme Some More"", ""What It is"", ""Dangerous"" and ""Break Ya Neck"" where he is flowing at unbelievable speeds. Although this live performance came after the release of arguably his weakest solo album ""It Ain't Safe No More"", Rhymes goes back into alot of his older repetoire, playing classics from all his albums and also including a performance of ""Scenario"" by Tribe Called Quest. The Extras on here are great too as we get a look at some interview footage and learn about the Flipmode Squad. This DVD is highly recommended to any fan of Busta, who is now set to release his latest album ""The Big Bang"" in May.",1145491200,8,1220,4.67906976744186
