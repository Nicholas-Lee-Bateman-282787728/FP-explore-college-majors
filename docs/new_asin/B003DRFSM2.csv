8394900,5,B003DRFSM2,This is such a well done documentary and an interesting account of an important event in Seattle History.  To see the early years of some of the landmarks those of us raised in Seattle have grown up with is fascinating and informative. I first saw this aired on TV and was so happy to see that amazon.com had it available for me to add to my DVD collection.,1342224000,,357,4.25
