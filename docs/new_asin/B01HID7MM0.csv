7787543,5,B01HID7MM0,"Potent, magical and dreamlike.  One of the most powerful programs I have ever seen about humans and their relationship with the physical world. Even when humans aren't the main topic, their presence is always there.  Some of the best moments aren't highlighted in the narration.  You have to watch and see for yourself.  Each episode is made up of vignettes, more than a few are unforgettable.  I was confused by the title though.  I was expecting a program with lots of physics, scientific explanations and some lovely cinematography.  Instead I found a program with some physics and some profound things to say about humanity. I was left asking questions and I don't usually do that with most nature/science documentaries.",1476316800,9,724,5.033613445378151
7787544,5,B01HID7MM0,"This is a four-part television documentary series that was co-produced by BBC Studios, PBS and France Tlvisions. Fifteen years ago BBC started their EARTH series documentaries and every few years they have produced different documentary as part of EARTH series that covers Planet Earth from its inhabitants to the natural forces that impacts it all. These are very educational documentaries where you will witness cultures in the most remote locations of Planet Earth that you will never find in any other documentary. It offers so much knowledge that it can easily be overwhelming so I watch each series more than once and on the second run, I stop the video and do my search on the Web for the locations in order to relate to each segment accordingly and learn properly. Watch it with your kids since they will learn so much about other cultures without leaving their home and with its dramatic cinematography and high quality video production, every location that they visit can easily be considered in ones bucket list. A must see documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1475884800,10,1068,4.972067039106145
8765510,3,B01HID7MM0,"This is a BBC production, edited with American voice-over for PBS.  The good: as is always the case with the BBC, the photography is outstanding, and the science is done accurately.  The bad: the information is rather banal.  Most of the science here is very basic, and seems designed for viewers who never read a textbook.  Also, the narrative tends to wander. There are too many digressions into peripheral topics like primitive cultures in Africa and New Guinea.  As a result, the presentations drag in places.  This documentary series would have been better if it had been more concise, and stayed on point.",1527552000,,611,4.883495145631068

8765514,3,B01HID7MM0,"I should have looked more closely. (Really, it was obvious). This is not the incredible BBC original, but the PBS 'remix' that's been neutered of Brian Cox's energetic, honest and engaging hosting. The cinematography is there, but it's just another semi-boring Nova miniseries now, with a bland voiceover narration. What's next? Replacing Sagan in Cosmos with a public radio voiceover? I'm sure there was some silly legal reason for it, but still.

Brian Cox is not just a narrator, he's the real deal. A physicist with the power to make complex things understandable by all, and removing him from this series should never have even been considered.",1500163200,4,649,5.065420560747664

8765516,1,B01HID7MM0,"I'm still shaking my head at this bizarre documentary series. Imagine that you live in a alternate universe where discussing any scientific fact is forbidden. Then imagine you are asked to produce a science/nature documentary in that universe. You might come up with something very similar to ""Forces of Nature,"" which goes out of its way to avoid discussing the actual topic of each episode.

Take, for example, the episode about elements, titled ""Elements."" At the start of the program, you might expect to learn something about elements over the course of the next hour. Like what an element is, or what makes one element different from another. Nope!

You do get a lot of footage of Costa Rican children playing with water, and there's some cool-looking film of people in Indonesia putting out a sulfur fire. You learn that water is made of the elements hydrogen and oxygen, and that sulfur is an element. (What's an element? Who cares!) Later, there are mountain goats in northern Italy that lick salt off a dam. That footage is pretty cool, since the goats have to climb an extremely steep wall to get to the salt. But what does this have to do with elements? I guess the salt and the goats are made of elements, but that's true of literally everything in the universe; there's no indication of why these particular images are being shown. Then there's a section bout mayflies, in which, again, no elements are mentioned by the narrator. Finally, there is some discussion about the possibility of life on other planets, I kid you not. Once again, elements are not mentioned in this segment.

Wait, I think I just figured out the reason why this series exists; I'll save that for the end.*

Speaking of the narrator, I should mention that the narration is unexpectedly poor for a BBC series. Most of the time, it seems to go far out of its way to avoid mentioning elements by name or discussing anything about them. (There are quite a few uses of the word ""alchemy,"" which is here used as a synonym for chemistry. Since alchemy was a pseudoscience that denied the existence of stable elements, I was confused by its frequent use, with a positive connotation, in a show about elements.) The narrator reads every word with the same emphasis, as if he was reading them off flash cards shown to him one at a time.

Let me be clear: I'm not saying that the show did a bad job of explaining what elements are. I'm saying it didn't even try. I feel like I know less about the universe now than before I watched this show.

Don't miss the episode ""Shape,"" in which we learn about the concept of ""round"" by interviewing people in Florida about manatees. Apparently manatees are round, or close enough. In an ideal world, they would be perfectly spherical, the narrator tells usbut sadly, ""nature doesn't work that way."" I guess nature abhors a sphere. Also, manatees are vegetarians, they have bad breath, and they like to hang out near power plant water outlets for warmth. And that's just about all you need to know about shapes.

*Here's my realization about this show. The producers at BBC must have tons of unused nature footage lying around, stuff that didn't make the cut at the real nature shows. Apparently the bit about mayflies wasn't exciting enough for Planet Earth. But this footage (along with the manatees, dam-climbing goats, diving Korean grandmothers, etc.) was expensive to produce. Why not make a whole new series out of this second-rate footage? Great idea, but what is the series about? Let's find some themes that could pertain to anything, properties that almost everything has: Color, Shape, Motion, Elements. Add some vague narration about ""the alchemy of life"" (and don't bother to have actual scientists vet the content), and this rejected footage is now a brand-new BBC/PBS documentary series.

Congratulations, BBC: you've just devalued your brand! I'll be less excited about future BBC/PBS documentaries after wasting my time with this one.",1483833600,8,3968,4.80791788856305
8765517,3,B01HID7MM0,"As someone who enjoyed past series of BBC documentaries that featured Prof. Brian Cox (Wonders of the Solar System, Wonders of the Universe, etc.), I was quite excited to see the newest of this series titled ""Forces of Nature."" I was a bit surprised to discover that this documentary was to be released in the US by PBS, instead of the usual BBC. But so long as there is Brian Cox, what difference does this make? Quite a lot, actually.

At its core, the PBS release of Forces of Nature takes the original BBC release, and edits out all of Brian Cox. So while most of the wonderful BBC cinematography and scrip has been retained, the wonder-filled narration of Brian Cox has been replaced by a flat, stilted American narration. And nowhere is Cox to be seen.

For fans of Brian Cox's work, I would recommend the BBC release of Forces of Nature instead of this lesser PBS version.",1483747200,29,879,4.522012578616352
