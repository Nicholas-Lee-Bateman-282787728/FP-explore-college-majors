7979814,3,B000087F1H,"Fu Manchu... legendary criminal mastermind. He has spies and saboteurs throughout Asia and devious plots which would take a genius to unravel.

Of course, in this TV program he seems to be a guy in a dress who hangs out with a midget and a woman who could USE a good dress. The accent he speaks sounds like the one used by Peter Sellers in Murder By Death, when he played detective Sidney Wang (not a coincidence, maybe?). And the plots! Resurrecting Hitler? I can't imagine a scheme more likely to fail. Germ warfare? OK, except Fu Manchu depends on a ship captain who is not in on the plot and has no reason not to betray him. A plan to cause distrust among members of an international conference? I hardly think they would have needed the Fumaster for that.

I halfway expected Fu Manchu to come up with a plan to make money in the real estate market. Or with junk bonds.

And what was with watching a TV watching Fu Manchu playing chess?

Still, an interesting example of early television.",1374451200,,993,4.43956043956044
7979815,4,B000087F1H,"1st, outstanding service and great product, exactly as described.
2nd., amazing piece of early TV history and a welcome edition to my Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee interpretations of this wonderful pulp character.",1264896000,,217,5.606060606060606
7979816,1,B000087F1H,I remember this back in the 50's as being scary. My sister and I had nightmares over the evil genius of Dr. Fu Manchu. Looking at it now I realize how silly it was and the awful acting!  Also the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.,1168300800,2,242,3.84
7979817,5,B000087F1H,I thought this was a pretty good series from the waning days of Republic Pictures.  I enjoyed Glen Gordon's portrayal of Fu.  Somewhat over-the-top.  I liked it.,1072742400,2,161,4.888888888888889
7979818,3,B000087F1H,"Here we are presented with several episodes revolving around the infamous Fu Manchu. Considering the age of the show the picture quality is quite good and the plots are serviceable, but as has been pointed out before, anyone expecting to recognize the Fu Manchu of literature will be sadly dissapointed.
Hopefully, one day soon we will see the series of Fu Manchu movies made in the 1960s find their way onto DVD, Based on the actual books and given a decent budget those features would easily find a way into my collection.
UPDATE 11/27/04: All of the five Christopher Lee Fu Manchu movies are available on DVD. From Region 2 the first three (Face of.., Brides of...and Vengeance of Fu Manchu) are available in a box set (can order from Amazon's UK site) and the final two are available in Region 1. So, if you haven't already purchased a region free DVD player, the message is simple.",1049068800,10,886,4.649681528662421
7979819,3,B000087F1H,"First off, let me say this is a nice dvd. The picture is quite good considering the age of the show, there are a few rough spots to the prints used, but overall it's a pleasing picture. The sound is ok, too. There are no extras to speak of, except for a catalogue of other Alpha Video titles to look through. Now for the shows themselves. This is a terrible show! The acting is amateurish and the stories are dull and boring! Which is a pity. Sax Rohmer wrote some great novels featuring the devil doctor (""THE BRIDE OF FU MANCHU"", ""THE HAND OF FU MANCHU"", ""THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU"", ""THE ISLAND OF FU MANCHU"" and ""SHADOW OF FU MANCHU"" being the best) but no film producers have ever adapted his stories for the screen. With this series (produced by Republic Pictures) it appears the writers had never read the books and are only vaguely aware of what Fu Manchu is all about. For example, in one episode on this disc, Dr. Fu joins forces with Adolph Hitler to wreck vengeance on the world. Now anyone who has read the books knows that in ""THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU"" (published in 1939) we find out that Fu hates war and has a plot to assassinate Hitler, which good old (or dumb old) Nayland Smith tries to stop! But the hack writers of this show, probably unable to read, were not aware of this fact and just figured, well heck, Fu is evil, Hitler was evil, let's have them join forces. DUMB! Still, if you enjoy Rohmer's work and Fu, you might enjoy this disc. It's good for a few laughs anyhow and it shows what a good writer ole Sax was and how lousy many of Hollywood writers were in the Golden Age of TV. - George Bauch.",1048204800,17,1621,4.249190938511327
