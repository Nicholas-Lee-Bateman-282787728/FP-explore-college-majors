8634165,1,B002WERRG2,"Very poorly done video.

There is a lot of talk about kinetics of skiing fast but never once is there a step by step analysis of technique.  There should be slow motion analysis showing a skiers CG along with proper body angles.  1/2 of the video is a ski footage montage with no commentary.  You are better off buying some world cup footage instead of this DVD.  Wish I could get my money back.",1323907200,,395,4.283783783783784
