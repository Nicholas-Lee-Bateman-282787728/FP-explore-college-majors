4690345,5,B005GD0074,This is the best explanation of the Bible for kids that we have ever seen.  We have even learned some things ourselves.  Great transaction.  Thanks!,1367625600,,148,4.84
4690346,5,B005GD0074,"The kids love this vid - and it has plenty of adult humor, too!  If you've been down the ""Veggie Tales road"" these videos are a fantastic next step",1367452800,,147,4.068965517241379
4690347,5,B005GD0074,"I recommend this product to anyone wanting to teach their children the foundations of the Bible.  The series goes beyond just cartoons and entertainment.  It covers tricky subjects as well as information that can easily be overlooked in Sunday School.  I grew up in Christian Schools and the ""What's In The Bible"" series taught beyond what I learned in K-12.  It doesn't just cover the stories and issues, but also provides background information and clarity on things that kids and Adults might have about the Bible.  I would even suggest that Christian Schools adopt this series into their curriculum! We were VERY impressed with WITB.",1367020800,3,637,5.0285714285714285
4690348,5,B005GD0074,"Oh Veggie Tales.  Nothing could warm the hearts of children and adults like a tiny asparagus playing the role of David the shepherd or a giant cucumber starring as King Nebuchadnezzar.  Nothing could fill a half hour better than a row of singing peas. Though not entirely accurate, this series was absurdly funny, and let's face it, Phil Vischer is a genius with his writing.

When I heard that Phil Vischer had embarked an another grand project called ""What in the Bible?"", I knew it had to be something good.  So, of course, I'm thrilled to be part of the Race to the Finish blog tour.  This tour covers every book of the Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi.  I had the privilege of taking a look at Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

If you've ever read through the books of Leviticus and Numbers, you know they can be... a little dry.  There's not much you can do to spice up an entire book of rules, but Vischer did a great job keeping the audience engaged with the help of some really fun characters like Buck Denver, Sunday School Lady and Preacher Man.  They took on the tough task of explaining the difference between ritual rules and ethical rules, mapping out the meaning of holiness, and showing how these books fit into the big picture of the Bible.  The songs were lively and fun (I especially loved the Pentateuch one on the boat -- you can see it on the promo video) The information in these videos seems easy enough for kids to understand, but also informative for parents as well.  For example, I love the parallel of the Israelites wandering in the desert to a really LONG time-out!  The Bentley Brothers were fabulous, performing creative and fun songs to coordinate with each weeks lesson.  I can see kids really liking these guys!

In the church edition DVD pack (I don't think this is the church edition listing, but I couldn't find that one -- SORRY); you get the DVD to watch as a group (with 4 weeks worth of sessions),  a DVD-ROM with audio and video files (including bonus out-takes), as well as Print Materials for each week.  Some of the print materials include worksheets or templates for small group activities, prop lists, and take home papers. You could easily use the DVD without the print material, but it's nice to have if you want to add a few extras each week.

Overall, I'm impressed with the content and Phil's courage to take on the tough issues in the Bible.  I've heard a lot of good about this DVD series, and I'm in complete agreement.  Be sure to check out the others stops along this blog tour and enter the grand prize giveaway (a complete set of the Old Testament curriculum!!).

4690349,5,B005GD0074,"This video is fantastic.  My children love it, as do I.  I found myself singing the songs during the day.  It's actually really funny, in some parts - enough to keep adults interested too.  I always learn something new about the Bible when Phil Vischer puts out a video.  I cannot WAIT to buy every single one in the series.  Upon getting in the car, not much can warm a heart more than ""mommy, can we watch the Bible movie?""",1348185600,3,425,4.25
4690350,5,B005GD0074,"For anyone who is critical of children's Biblical videos/books because either the author is not a Christain or their theology is very liberal, this will be refreshing. The videos may be a little boring for kids under 4. It is very educational. Will end up purchasing entire set.",1324598400,,278,4.8125
4690351,5,B005GD0074,You can tell these folks love their work by the effort they have put into this video. I have shown it to various children in my congregation and they all want to see it again and again. A clear presentation of the Scripture story and I can't wait for when more are produced.,1322179200,,274,4.188679245283019

4690354,4,B005GD0074,"I'm finally beginning to see how the What's in the Bible? series might make it through the Bible in 13 episodes.  After getting through Genesis and Exodus in the first two videos, we actually tackle three books in volume 3: Wanderin' In The Desert.

Okay, so maybe getting through Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in one hour isn't quite as amazing as it sounds.  After all, much of the content in these books are laws about how the Jews were to conduct their lives as God's chosen people.  This is a pretty easy area to summarize.

For those not familiar with the series, it's a collection of DVD's designed to teach kids not only what is in the Bible but how it relates to our lives today.  The series was created by Phil Vischer, the man behind VeggieTales.  This time, he hosts along with a bunch of giant puppets.  There are songs, there are jokes, and there are some pretty serious discussions in all of this.

Each hour video in broken down into two 30 minute segments.  The first focuses on Leviticus, the largest collection of laws in the Bible.  Along the way, we learn the difference between ethical laws (don't lie, don't kill) and ritual laws (don't trim your beard.  We also learn what Holy means and why mashed potatoes might or might not be Holy.

Part two covers Numbers and Deuteronomy, focusing on Israel's 40 year punishment for not trusting God to give them the Promised Land.  It also tackles the big question of whether or not we can trust the Bible, even talking about some of what those who don't believe the Bible offer as counter arguments to what the Bible says.  The video ends with a nice recap of the first three videos in a song about the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) set on a river boat.  Yes, it does make sense in context (or at least to new stage manager Marcie).

A couple of times, I thought this might video might not live up to the first two.  I mean, how do you really find much of anything entertaining in these three books?  As Phil said in an interview, there is a reason we normally skip over these books when planning stories for Sunday School.  But just as it was getting a bit dry, they'd throw in an unexpected joke or song and they'd have my interest again.  The songs also snuck up on me.  I was at first skeptical, and they are a bit simple.  But I found myself smiling at how they were weaving serious truths into a catchy melody before they were done.

These videos are a great resource for parents or kids' leaders at churches.  They may not retell the familiar stories of the Bible in the ways we are used to, but they continue to put them in a theological context that is solid yet explained simply enough for kids to understand.  Heck, I'm learning a thing or two myself while being entertained.

Wanderin' In The Desert really did have a lot going against it.  While not quite the most entertaining video in the series to date, it does continue the incredible series What's in the Bible?",1429660800,,2957,4.446096654275093
4690355,5,B005GD0074,"If you want to get some good stuff into your kiddos noggins and hear them wildly laugh- this is for you! The kids at church like this, aged up to the tween ages. This is just well done all around. We hope to get the whole set!",1427328000,,226,3.8297872340425534

I am very impressed with it's content, it is definitely the right mix of education and humor. The kids love it and learn much from watching it. I hope they continue to make more- I would love to see Jesus' parables, for example.",1422144000,,319,4.161290322580645
4690358,5,B005GD0074,"Excellent product. Bought for a nine-year-old girl  -- shared information in an entertaining and respectful way (much more clear than Veggie Tales, yet still well-received by a young audience). I appreciate the reverence and loving spirit this producer has. The content is accurate. A great series to partake in. Every family could benefit from this material -- a uch more worthwhile use of time relaxing in front of the TV.",1421798400,,424,5.057142857142857
4690359,5,B005GD0074,"Covering the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, these two 25-minute episodes are full of questions about the rules of Leviticus--why is death a punishment? Are we supposed to follow them today?--and it has great little songs.

Magical are the appearances by the comic-song writing team of Rhett McLaughlin and Lincoln Neal as ""the Bentley Brothers."" They wear what look like 70's tuxedos and wearing wigs,and every song they do in this series is delight. They are in the earlier disks.

Yet another highlight is the ""Pentateuch"" song, sung by seven puppets on a cartoon riverboat.

A couple of things worth mentioning:

This series' creator is Phil Vischer, who already created the ""VeggieTales"" series. His autobiography, ""Me, Myself, and Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables"" tells how he founded--then lost--that company. The irony is that losing his company freed Phil Vischer to find a greater dream. Perhaps a dream God had planned for him. This series is part of Vischer's new work. It highlights major ideas from the Bible, and gives a bird's eye view of the whole thing. Every disk is a hit, and #2 including the ""Bentley Brothers"" is informative great fun.

At the top of the credits of each disk in the ""What's in the Bible?"" series, are the simple words ""Written and Performed by Phil Vischer."" Every puppet and it's voice, right down to the movement of it's arms, plus what the puppet says--and sings--because all songs (except the handful by the ""Bentley Brothers"") are also written by Vischer. Unlike the VeggieTales series, he only used three or four animators per DVD. A small team has meant lower costs. That is one reason these DVD are more easily affordable.

When he owned VeggieTales, he started the ""Silly Songs"" that have been extremely popular. Same guy who wrote songs like ""The Water Buffalo Song"" (there are ""Silly Songs"" videos) also wrote the Pentateuch song, here.

The material in this part of the Bible is tricky. ""Leviticus"" is a hard book in the Bible. ""Numbers"" has much to do with counting numbers of people. ""Deuteronomy"" is a summary.

Anyone who can help people get something of great value from these challenging books, and make it fun, and yet not avoid some tough questions, and do it all so a 3-year old can enjoy it, and so someone familiar with the Bible can learn something from it, and that is full of details that make it worth watching time after time, is a creative genius.

This DVD, like others in the series, can make it easier to understand the vast material in the 66-book Bible.

There are more bonus features on this DVD than on most of the others, and all the bonuses are fun.

Imaginative teaching combined with clever songs fosters understanding.",1418342400,,2741,4.835470085470085

It is from the creator of Veggie Tales, Phil Vischer.  He uses creative music, a fun cast of puppets and some cartoons to share the timeless truths of scripture to a new generation. I have purchased the first 4 dvd's and our family has enjoyed watching them together.  I will definitely buy the rest of the series!

8471474,5,B005GD0074,"I love all the information packed into these DVDs.  Some of the things the kids are learning are things that many adults never learn.  It's a great tool for teaching kids (and adults) about the Bible.  The kids consider it funny, love the songs and characters, and like that I'm using it as part of their Homeschool Bible class this year.  It has to be viewed multiple times for it to really sink in (since it packs so much information in some episodes) but that's ok.  It make for good conversations and teaching.  I extend the learning with hands on activities in our Bible Interactive Notebook.  Just have a few more DVDs to acquire and watch.  One improvement that could be made is to have the characters speak more slowly.  The content is hard so slowing it down would be great.  Younger kids may not understand the content but will with time.",1502755200,,848,4.519736842105263
