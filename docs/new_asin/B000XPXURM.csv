8229046,1,B000XPXURM,Misinformation.  Do not buy into this,1514332800,,37,5.166666666666667
8229047,1,B000XPXURM,"Terrible, inaccurate movie.  Ends do NOT justify the means in their minds, and this is beyond idiotic.  The quality is like what you'd expect from a high school students amateur documentary, and that will be the intelligence of the people who watch this and believe this to be an accurate representation of reality.

I used to be LDS and am now agnostic, and this was just deceptive, which even if not an outright mistruth is lying in my book.  Mind you I don't even believe in the Bible and my morals wouldn't allow me to make a video like this and sell it as though it were truthful.  Absolutely unbelievable.",1298678400,5,611,4.5181818181818185
8229048,5,B000XPXURM,"I agree with the other reviewer, that most Mormons are wonderful people. But, living in Salt Lake, I've encountered several who think that their church is the only way to God. Many of them don't respect the religious views of other faiths. I love Self Realization Fellowship's Church of All Religions. Now there is a religion that loves any religion that leads to a God that loves unconditionally. All institutional religions should take a bite of their apple. Love to all and respect to the Mormons who are charitable AND understanding.",1269907200,,537,4.912087912087912
8229049,1,B000XPXURM,"Where are these guys getting their information? ""They don't have to repent for their sins"" Honestly! Mormon repentence is one of the hardest things I've ever seen, it can take up to a year! Where as saying ten hail marys can be done on what? A coffee break? Why are there so many groups determined to bring Mormons down? Mormons don't teach their congregations that any other religion is bad or false. On the contrary they teach that each religion has some basis in truth. If you really want to know seek out something non-biased like Mormonism for Dummies. Or better yet just ask a Mormon because you sure as heck aren't getting any truth here!

Seriously people! Get a life and quit trying to ruin other's. The Mormon church is one of the most peaceful and generous institutions I have ever known and if you think that is a bad, evil thing to you then you need your head examined.

P.S the only reason there is a star on this review is because I couldn't continue to the next screen without marking something",1227916800,15,1010,4.483695652173913
