8068427,4,B0009WKG4Y,This movie was okay. I just feel what was said could have been said in a shorter period of time. I have no qualms with lenght but if you are going to use length then make the time less repetitious and more quality. Just say something more than what you have already said. Again the music and acting was good.,1183507200,5,308,4.15

The South Korean mini-series LOVE LETTER unites three of that country's most popular young actors for a sensitive melodrama of warring personal desires. Andrew (Hyun-jae Jo, UNTOLD SCANDAL) is a bright, orphaned teen who is saved from an abusive foster home by his kindly priest-uncle, Father Peter (Hyeon-ju Son). Deeply religious and determined to become a priest like his uncle, Andrew finds his resolve tested by a platonic friendship with his beautiful classmate, Eun-ha (Aeh Soo, A FAMILY), herself an orphan. Completing the love triangle is the pair's mutual friend Woo-jin (Jin-hee Ji, DAE JANG GEUM), whose growing attraction to Eun-ha sparks Andrew's jealousy and makes him further question his choice of a religious life. Amply displaying the strong acting, gripping storylines, and well-drawn characters for which K-dramas have become known, the romantic mini-series is presented in its entirety with this collection of 16 episodes.",1167609600,8,993,5.490196078431373
8068429,5,B0009WKG4Y,"This is a Korean drama Masterpiece. This drama is soooooooo good. If you are Catholic and Love Jesus and Mary, you'll love this production. If you are a Priest, you'll love your Priesthood evenmore after you watch this. And if you are thinking of the Priesthood, this may well give you the final nudge to it. Its the best Korean Drama production ever because of its fine storyline, artistic portrayal, and heart wrenching music. It gives anyone who ever wanted to become a Priest a good ""simulation"" of the road to the Priesthood. I simply cant get over its beauty. Winter Sonata (The other Korean Masterpiece) is number 2 for me. It reminds me of the storyline of Superman 2 where Clark Kent has to give up his superpowers to be with Lois Lane. I won't spoil your fun so go get it now and find out that the REAL SUPERMAN here is fighting for souls!",1129161600,11,849,4.448717948717949
