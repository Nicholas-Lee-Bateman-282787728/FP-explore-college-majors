4401505,5,B004LO0AJM,"I saw the movie on TV, but this movie was the best movie I have seen in years; and nobody but Betty White could have played the part so perfectly. It is definitely a movie to watch and treasure through the years.  I saved it to my DVR, but if the DVR box happens to go out, and have to be replaced, I will lose the movie.  Getting a DVD copy seems the right thing to do for this movie.  Netflix doesn't have it yet, and doesn't know when they will.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, you've missed a LOT!",1299456000,,505,3.9215686274509802
4401506,2,B004LO0AJM,"Amazon charged me $40 for ""collector's edition"" and all it was was just the DVD that says ""collector's edition"" on it. Nothing special to over charge people when Hallmark.com is charging only $20 for the same movie! I want a refund for this ASAP!

The movie was great and touching, but just don't buy it from AMAZON if they are going to continue charging double the cost for the movie.",1297123200,9,385,4.5
4401507,5,B004LO0AJM,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen! Betty White is an incredibly talented woman.  Whether a comedy or drama, she always brings it home and never disappoints. I went through a dozen tissues while watching this wonderful story that was so well written and well acted. I'm going to buy it for my Mom for Valentines Day. However, I found it to be cheaper on the
Hallmark website than on Amazon. If you like the Notebook, you will love this movie! Buy it, own it, watch it, treasure it! Enjoy but don't forget the tissues!",1296950400,37,529,4.3979591836734695
4401508,5,B004LO0AJM,"As the latest addition to the Hallmark Hall of Fame Library, this movie does not disappoint. Hewitt plays Susan Allison, a young woman who is a human interest reporter. She is assigned to cover a story about a woman named Caroline (Betty White) who sent her husband, Neil, off to WWII on Valentines day many decades ago. As she was patiently keeping the home fires burning she gave birth to their son. When her husband was reported MIA a year after shipping out, she initially hoped to find him among the returning wounded in the veterans hospital, but in time she just visited every week to read to the soldiers, a tradition she had continued through the years. She had also continued to visit Union Station, where she had said goodbye to Neil, every Valentine's Day, for 60+ years. The story of her courtship and marriage is told through flashback as she is being interviewed for the news story. Susan was initially hesitant about the whole thing, but as she becomes involved with Caroline, she also becomes involved with her grandson. He is a handsome young physical therapist, whose perspective on life is a stark contrast to that of her own boyfriend, Andrew, who recently proposed. As Susan becomes more immersed in the story of Caroline Thomas she puts her job on the line in order to try and discover what happened to Neil Thomas all those years ago.

The story is a great tribute to those who served in WWII, and to those left behind that rallied together to support the troops. It is an emotional journey as you follow Caroline's memories from ""love at first sight"" to the last sight of her love. Betty White is incredible and believable as the woman who had faced life with courage in spite of her suffering. The entire cast does justice to this moving and inspiring story. It is family friendly, though the scene of some of the war action near the end of the movie may be too intense for small children.",1296604800,64,1915,4.599415204678363
4401509,5,B004LO0AJM,"Hallmark has produced magnificent TV shows over the years, but this has to be one of the all time best. It was magnificent, touching, patriotic, and a 'national treasure'.  I hope Hallmark releases it on TV again - but earlier than 9:00 EST or PST so the younger generation can watch it.  It was on a Sunday night.  Betty White was just superb.  An Emmy for sure.  It should be sold in Hallmark stores and through other outlets.",1296604800,24,428,4.435897435897436
4401510,5,B004LO0AJM,"I watched this on CBS last evening and it was a beautifully made movie about a newly married Navy man who had to leave his young pregnant bride to fight in the Philippines during WW II. It was especially meaningful to me as my dad, who died this past August, served in the Philippines during that same war. While the young wife kept busy with their new son, she was troubled by the too often times letters were delivered to some of her neighbors informing them of the death or mia of their loved ones, always grateful she wasn't among them. But then the unthinkable happens when she, too, gets one of those letters. I don't want to give away the whole story but suffice it to say, I loved it and it brought tears more than once. Near the end was especially meaningful and emotional for me. Betty White and the entire cast were superb.  Following the movie, I immediately went to the Hallmark web site and ordered it. I highly recommend the film.",1296432000,23,945,4.4

Must see because it is the story of a truly devoted wife who still has hope keeps a commitment to her military husband who went to war but ""was missing in action.""  Ms. White truly an incredible, quick, spry actress showing no slow-down due to age.  Ms. Hewitt is engaging in her role as a passionate reporter who gives all to help the wife find out what happened to her husband.  Tearfully, I watched as I was a military wife whose husband almost died because of Desert Storm and feel similar longing and desperate hope for him.

4401557,5,B004LO0AJM,"The Lost Valentine absolutely surprised me with how good it was. Let's face it, you put in a Hallmark movie into your DVD player, you're expectations are only expecting acting, props, and the script to reach an entertaining but mediocre level. But The Lost Valentine pulled on your emotions (the main part of the story anyway) better than any other missing soldier with a wife or family back home film does. You're tearing up as you empathize with Betty White's character.  I can't think of a high budget movie about this subject that worked better making you feel the pride an the loss at the same time that the main character does, than with this film.  White's acting is brilliant, but it's not just her, it's the supporting minor actors who are the military character people, or even in the flashback era, the Western Union telegram deliverer that just make the film work.  The younger version of Caroline (White's character) was also really well acted by Meghann Fahy.  I admit I've never heard of her before, but she was brilliant too. The writing is good in the main story.  You felt the dread everyone in the street had, when the Western Union guy turns up on bicycle. As we meet other characters in the present with information on what happened to Caroline's husband, they are well written too.

The film isn't perfect.  Unfortunately you're reminded it's a Hallmark film with the grandson and journalist unnecessary and weak believablity wise minor storyline.  It's like some idiot at Hallmark saw the script and went, we've got to have a romance story in there too, our key demographic won't be happy if we make a film without one.  Someone should have pointed out that we already had that, with the Caroline character and her missing husband.  There is no greater romance story, than that one.  The journalist (and there's some spoilers here) could simply have realised as she talks to Caroline, that her suspicions were correct, she didn't feel the way about the guy who proposed to her (Will Chase - Luke Wheeler from Nashville) like Caroline felt love for Neil.  That was all the film needed. She could have been motivated to get to know Caroline and in turn help her find out what happened to her husband by simply being embarrassed and ashamed at her comparison to Caroline waiting at the train station to Hachi (also a very good film by the way) in front of the grandson or even the son.  We don't actually see much of the son as an adult, considering he was important in the flashback parts of the story.  The grandson character was a bit unrealistic. Why was his best friend his grandmother? What did she do in his childhood to make him so? He's got a non fiction book and somehow a bookstore has I think it was a three day signing session that has long lines.  Even with famous big name authors, you're pushing your luck with more than an hour, sometimes no one even turns up.  I found that very unrealistic and I just thought the so predictable storyline between him and the journalist was just detracting from the overall film.  Plus the initial making life difficult for the journalist interviewing Caroline wise made no sense other than shining a lot on, hey he's being difficult, that means these two will eventually hook up, since the grandson was the one who went to the TV station wanting his grandmother to appear on the show.

But it only detracted it half a star in rating, for me the main part of the story was so good that it carries that weak side story.",1499472000,,3489,4.609046849757673

4401563,5,B004LO0AJM,"Very different from other Hallmark movies. It doesn't follow the standard format. A young reporter goes to interview an elderly woman who goes to sit in the train station every year on Valentine's Day. Her new husband had left on Valentine's Day to serve in the Pacific Theatre in WWII. She received a telegram that said he was MIA. She immediately grabbed hold of a thread of hope and declared, ""Missing is not Dead."" So for the next 70 years she went back to that same train station to wait for his return. The young reporter manages to use her connections to try and find out what happened to the missing soldier all those years ago. I won't tell you what they learned or how things transpired from there. Don't want to ruin it for you. I'll just say that Betty White is a lived it.fabulous actress, except for the most crucial scene. She didn't have to act that one - she's lived it, and I think relived it for this movie.
This is by far my all time favourite Hallmark film.",1493683200,2,978,4.3791208791208796

4401568,5,B004LO0AJM,"SPOILER within this review!

I must admit that I bought the DVD of ""The Lost Valentine"" mainly because one of my favorite Hallmark movie actors, Sean Faris, is in it! However, with the rest of the cast, including the remarkable Betty White, and what I'd read about the storyline, I knew I would like it. This (liking it) proved to be an understatement because I LOVED this movie, and will undoubtedly re-watch it many, many times! I sometimes have trouble following movies that go back and forth between the present and the distant past, but this movie did it so seamlessly that I had no trouble whatsoever following it. Betty White is simply an amazing actress; her scenes in this movie were riveting.

Although I found the break-up of the reporter (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt) and her boyfriend Andrew (played by Will Chase) realistic and well done, the subsequent romance between the reporter and Caroline Thomas' (Betty White's) grandson (Sean Faris) seemed a bit rushed. A little more time should have been spent building the chemistry between these two characters.

However in no way did this take away from my enjoyment of this movie from beginning to end.",1490054400,,1167,4.8542713567839195

ALL Americans should subscribe to the values represented in this drama.

The actors got their character right.

4401599,5,B004LO0AJM,"I just watched this movie which I had recently recorded from the Hallmark channel to my DVR.  Without a doubt, it is one of the best movies I have seen; the subject matter is deeply moving - lost loved one due to war, yet it remains in the heart of the widow for decades - and it not only tugs at our deepest feelings about love and longing, but it shows, at least partially, the great grief of losing a loved one and the inability of some to let go of that deep love.  Betty White is at her best in this movie, and a scene toward the end (no spoilers here!) shows her great talent as a deep, emotionally mature actress.  Tears ran down my cheeks, and I was filled with the kind of appreciation that only comes to me when I see or feel something truly worthwhile, something that helps make me a better person.  It is not always easy to delve into the kinds of emotions that are shown in this movie, but if you are willing to, this movie will verify to you that tender, romantic love can truly lasts throughout a lifetime - and, according to my faith, beyond this life.

Kudos to the director and actors for masterfully bringing to life the this widow's love story; special kudos to the director for showing how a reporter (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt) grows to appreciate that long lasting love in her interview subject.

And THANK YOU to the Hallmark channels (both the regular one and the mystery one) that bring us great movies without the gore, violence, bad language and sexual content that are so common in today's theater and movie worlds.  While some Hallmark movies are a bit questionable in regard to the quality of the acting, directing and editing, many Hallmark movies are keepers and of a high quality; this Betty White movie is one of the best among the latter.

And, finally, I am even willing to pay $23 here on Amazon for a DVD copy of this movie; this truly is a keeper.  :-)",1469923200,,1897,4.351274787535411

4401650,5,B004LO0AJM,Excellent movie! If I have a weakness it is love stories in war settings. If I have another weakness it is those types of movies set during World War ll and accompanied by music of that era. The Lost Valentine contains all of this but something else as well. While Betty White's performance was excellent I feel that the performance of Meghann Fahy stole the show. Meghann played the role of young Caroline and her performance was believable and then some. That scene where she receives the dreaded Western Union telegraph is one of the best scenes in the history of film. And it didn't hurt that the song played during that moving scene was sung by the armed forces sweetheart Vera Lynn. A well done flick!,1441843200,,707,4.574803149606299

4401670,5,B004LO0AJM,"Bottom Line Up Front as the military, like Neil (who is in the Navy) would say: ""This is what Hallmark Hall of Fame Movies are All About.""

Deeply Moving story that makes everyone feel - in the special features they say how when taps was played on the bugle, not a dry eye among the cast - and it will be the same for you. Caroline tells how she is from a generation that prized service (and duty and honor) - and slowly that becomes a part of Susan's life - her being if you will - and that makes the story all the more precious. It isn't just about love, although that is the central theme, it isn't just about being faithful, although that is also part of the same theme (i.e. through love), but we learn how Neil gave of himself, and as the story unfolds it really makes sense how much Caroline keeps coming back, although her head knows Neil is gone, her heart says something deeper.

From the Porter, who comes by each year to say hello and compliments Caroline, to Susan's boss who is all business but in the end is all excited about the value the story (although he isn't a deep person like the main characters, he ""gets on board"" in his own way) to the friends and family around both Caroline and Susan to the senator whose staff helps dig up the critical information that lets them find Neil through one of the Filipino men who found Neil and his friend and helped them get back to health, it is a story that unfolds in such a way that I felt like I was living it along with the actors. When Caroline  sees the Navy uniforms come up the walk to her house, and has a near PTSD like flashback to the Western Union man delivering the bad news so many years ago, only to find that they are bringing some of his personal affects and tell her that he has been awarded posthumously the meritorious service medal (I think that was the 1st one mentioned), a purple heart and the Navy Cross - you can feel what Betty White in a suburb acting scene, so subtle yet so powerful, feels that mixes grief with joy, sadness with pride. From the moment you see the uniforms, if you didn't have the tissues ready, you should pause and reach for them, for the rest of the movie.

This was a story that just kept on giving. Don't miss it.

I have a few dozen Hallmark Hall of Fame movies, all rated at least 4 stars, and this is right at the top. The special features are wonderful as well, and this ""Making Of"" is very much worthwhile as it seems they have all been on Harmark DVDs for the past several years. It tells how those are real people the Navy provided including the honor guard. You'll learn how when filming at the home, the real neighborhood learned that Betty White has a soft spot for animals so people kept coming by with their pets, Betty would want to see and hold the pets and thus the locals got to meet Betty White. Funny, actually.

My other Hallmark favorites: ""Away and Back"", ""Have a Little Faith"", ""The Magic of Ordinary Days"", ""Candles on Bay Street"", ""Ellen Foster"", ""The Piano Lesson"" and ""The Love Letter"".",1427587200,,3026,4.2907180385288965

4401709,5,B004LO0AJM,This movie is one for the ages!! I cannot remember ever sitting on the edge of my seat with tears streaming down my face for any other story. This truly touched my heart! The story is amazing and I wish more and more people were able to find this type of love that not only brings people together but shows each and every single one of us that no matter where in the world or no matter the time or distance someone still loves you. I definitely plan to watch this movie over and over again and also get the book that it was based on. I couldn't imagine going to the same place for 66 years to wait on someone then come to find out that they died a hero ten times over. Truly a fabulous movie for our military men and women. Get a box of tissues ladies and gents! Definitely worth more then 5 stars in my book!!!!!!,1412380800,,814,4.062111801242236
4401710,3,B004LO0AJM,"This movie seems to be made up of platitudes.  That's not all bad.  Helping others is good.  Being faithful in love, and keeping promises, is good.  Facing danger to save someone is good.  Building a spiritual foundation out of which we can do these things is good.  Recognizing that we need to be like this is good.

And the conventions of movie making are good as a framework if they are well used. But, well --

I shed tears as I often do, but this movie didn't move me the way it did lots of other people.  I missed fine and subtle detail in the way Susan gradually realized what she needed.  When Neil (in flashback) had to make his hard decision, I didn't see him experience the conflict that must surely have been there.  So it was, for me, a bit flat.  Some movies with which I agree a lot less, are much more rewarding.",1411689600,,828,4.237179487179487

It's not that I'm a huge Jennifer Love Hewitt fan, or that guy that plays the lead (I remember him from Smallville and I didn't like him then) but this movie is so worth watching. I cried the entire time. No lie. And that doesn't happen often. Betty White is fabulous, the flashbacks are wonderful...the music, the costume design...everything. The storyline is original.

I loved Betty White's portrayal of the war widow who bravely waited - and hoped- for many years.  She finally was there when her beloved husband returned, but not the way one would have hoped.  It is a real testament to the great Americans who served, and those who waited for their return at home.  Although I bawl like a baby each time I see this movie, I absolutely LOVE it.

After we received our copy, it then became more readily available online and in Hallmark Stores and drugs stores that carry Hallmark movies. Both my daughter and I were in tears at the end of the movie. They were kind of half happy, and half sad tears.

4401782,4,B004LO0AJM,"Forever love, that is the heart of this story. When Susan, a TV reporter who conjures of feel good stories to tug at the heart, gets roped into a byline from her boss about Caroline's story of her MIA WWII husband that she still waits for, every Valentine's day when he left, and never came back home. Fraught with her own lackluster love life, Susan does her job because she has to, but ends up caught up in Caroline's story, and the unfailing support of Caroline's grandson, Lucas. Both which makes her realize what's really missing in her life.

God, really. Why don't guys like Lucas exist??? I digress...so okay, anyway, the movie did what it was supposed to do. Make us swoon, tear up a little and expect what we want: a feel good romantic movie with all the right lines and scenes. The Lost Valentine does it all, from beginning to end.

There is enough background to make it plausible but doesn't go in that deep. However, that's your basic romance movie for you and it was done well enough. The cast is great, especially with seasoned actresses of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Betty White. Each actor gave us a character we can relate to and with just enough without it getting over the top or cheesy. They're believable and you feel for them. The pacing and editing was seamless; the production didn't feel stagey and even the music was great. My only complaint is that it ended too quickly!

The last Hallmark movie that had me glued in and smiling like an idiot was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Letter/dp/B00004WI57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Letter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sarah-Plain-Tall-Collection/dp/6305613532/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sarah, Plain & Tall Collection</a>.

4401808,5,B004LO0AJM,"This movie was a gift and we watched it for the first time this afternoon; my wife and I were both deeply moved by this movie and inspired by the solid values it so ably presents. This is the story of a WW II romance that tracks the experience of so many young couples of the era. The flashbacks to that time were effective and brought back many memories.

During the Second World War my wife and I were still in public school and both of us recall the various activities that involved the civilian population during that time. The music was all very familiar as were the references to collecting scrap metal for the war effort, the victory gardens that almost everyone in our neighborhood had, and the flags with stars draped in the windows showing the number of family members away in the armed forces.

All of this is firmly engraved in my memory and this movie brought them back with force as this tender love story was told. The settings, the ambience, the music are all effectively done to give the viewer a small glimpse of life in the 1940's.

The story focuses on a WW II widow who had a special method for remembering her missing husband; this comes to the attention of a TV station who decides to feature her in a TV program. The widow is marvelously played by Betty White who brings a tender and touching conviction to the role. The young TV reporter, played by the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt, is at first skeptical of the assignment but begins to develop a loving concern for the elderly widow and decides to carry the assignment on to its conclusion.

The movie switches from the contemporary story to the WW II romance with a series of flashbacks. It is these flashbacks that so effectively convey the feelings of the WW II era. The director, Darnell Martin does a fine job of coordinating the various parts into a most remarkable whole, creating a glimpse of the past as well as a tribute to the love between a man and his wife.

This movie is grand family fare and worthy of repeated watchings; it has moments of emotional intensity which will move the great majority of viewers. I recommend it highly.",1322611200,12,2120,4.496103896103896
4401809,5,B004LO0AJM,"What a smart, moving movie about the lifelong ties of love.  Betty White is (as always) an amazing actress and very believable in this part.  Get the tissues out - this one will get you.  The story is predictable, but I don't watch movies like this to be surprised - I watch for the acting and very moving storyline.  It's just a good wholesome movie about life.
I bought this movie for my 85 y/o Mother (her request) and we watched it together.  She could relate to the the clothing, era and war times as a very young woman.  Very nice to watch with someone that lived through such a tough time.",1319673600,,596,4.276785714285714
4401810,5,B004LO0AJM,"I had seen this movie on the Hallmark channel on t.v. I had recorded it with the DVR service because I love a good romance story. I also have a few family members currently serving over sea and alot of friends serving overseas. I thought this movie was really well played out. I love that Betty White goes to the train station on her anniversary with this soldier in the hopes of his safe return. She goes to this bench in this train station for many years. Then Jennifer Love Hewitt comes to interview her because her boss wants to know the story behind why Betty White waits at the train station. Along the way, Jennifer meets the nephew of Betty White, and unfolds another romance. It turns out that the nephew also wanted to know the story about the romance. I really liked how the movie flowed, it was very realistic. Jennifer, does find out the true romance story and helps to bring closure to Betty White's questions about what happened to her soldier. I thought this was an excellent movie! It's definitely one of those movies, that you can curl up with a blanket in your favorite chair or on the couch, while it's raining outside and watch it. I also like that it's ok for children to watch. There is no bad language or graphic scenes. I really enjoyed this product and I enjoy the story. I hope to find more romance stories like this one.",1311984000,6,1348,4.417670682730924
