5439274,5,B00AIZ2LR2,A funny as hell anime about two policemen! The violence and sex are over the top and that is what makes this series a must have.,1415577600,3,128,3.9615384615384617
5439275,4,B00AIZ2LR2,There is a lot for people to find offensive about this anime. And the animation quality is quite dated. But the it's over the top and the crazy sort of anime we used to watch back in the day.,1413676800,,191,3.923076923076923
5439276,1,B00AIZ2LR2,its s*** and you should not watch it because it is shit this is honestly one of the worst anime ever and you should never have to sit through this garbage,1394496000,,154,4.0
5439277,5,B00AIZ2LR2,"Not for kids due to violence and nudity, definitely adult but not Hentai. Wish it was longer but story line was simple and had a satisfying ending.",1380844800,8,147,4.481481481481482
5439278,4,B00AIZ2LR2,"Mad Bull 34 is a portrait of gritty 1970s NY policing as portrayed by several Japanese anime writers who'd likely never been to NYC, clearly watched too many Dirty Harry movies, and did far too many drugs. The story barely matters as it's mostly an excuse for violent action sequences, various incoherencies, and rape, but it involves a straight-laced rookie cop and his new partner, Sleepy Estes - who ""doesn't play by the rules"".

MB34 is somewhat notorious among anime collectors for its misogyny and extreme violence. There's at least 3 rapes per episode and one of the 4 episodes in the 4 part OVA is called ""Hit and Rape"". Sleepy actually runs the town prostitution racket too. The level of violence borders on Fist of the North Star levels. Despite Sleepy shooting about half the unarmed criminals in every episode, in the head, before even announcing he's a cop, he only gets investigated once ""for excessive force"". None too shockingly, this anime was brought to you by many of the same people as Crying Freeman, which makes sense because it's basically like Lethal Weapon if it was made by the makers of Crying Freeman, on drugs.

That's not to say this is at all bad. In a certain bizarre way, despite the rampant to the point of hilarious misogyny, outrageously bad localization, it's a very fun anime that reminds you of why you watched anime as a kid - it was comics for teens and grownups before comics had grown up. It was when anime was fun and didn't take itself too seriously.

Recommended for 80s anime buffs.",1374537600,16,1529,4.676579925650557
5439279,5,B00AIZ2LR2,This 1 is for fans of early -old school anime-it is set in a NYC that no longer exists back before Guiliani cleaned up Gotham. It is a gritty cop tale & worth it for fans of this genre,1373328000,8,184,3.7435897435897436
5439280,5,B00AIZ2LR2,"Everything you would expect in an anime.  Blood, guts, sex, and violence but this anime is not good at all.  I should have known since I did not find the anime entertaining.  I don't know, but the Japanese must have a different opinion about life in a big U.S. city and police in a big U.S. city.",1367280000,3,296,4.157894736842105
5439281,5,B00AIZ2LR2,I remember seeing a preview from Manga Video a long time ago and is one of the most awesome shows I have ever seen.,1364169600,9,115,3.8333333333333335
5439282,4,B00AIZ2LR2,"I have been trying to get this full feature for more than 20 years.

This is the full classic and it is classic goodness.
Now for those who have not watched classic anime there are some things you should be aware of:
1. There is plenty of graphic violence. This is well beyond what you standard get in modern anime.
2. There is real fan support. This means nudity not today's ""the beach episode"" and ""the hot springs swimsuit episode"".
3. The dub is not good. People trying to do New York accents to laughable ends. Don't worry you will get used to it and may even like it. The voice acting also just plain feels different that what you get today.
4. Computer software is not used to match the dub to the mouths so it sometimes is off.
5. And yes, it is classic hand drawn animation. It has a warmth we do not get in the soulless computer assisted stuff we get today. However being hand drawn it will not be as smooth at time as what a new viewer expects.

Needless to say this is not an acceptable substitute for Nemo or Monsters Inc, when trying to keep kids out of your hair.

This movie follows a tradition that many classic anime did back in the day, rip off American cinema/TV (just like today Hollywood now feeds off Japan).
You have the badass American cop with a heart of gold and his Japanese partner. There is comedy, unintentional comedy, and blood shed galore. There is fan support like the traditional shower scene and there is enough additional nudity and risque scenes to make the creators of Queens Blade blush.
Exploding heads? This anime has got them! Concealed hand grenades? You bet! A hilarious view of America? Oh yeaaaah!
Plot wise the feature is terrible and we expect that. In fact we crave the cheese. This is 8 year old cheddar quality cheese at times. Episode 4 revels in it where you see American features from Aliens to Airwolf ripped off, it is glorious. You will cringe, you will laugh, you will cry.

Features like this are what helped make anime popular in America.

The Discotek/Eastern Star has beautifully cleaned this up like the other releases they have been putting out. They are doing really great work that is aimed past the American anime fan all the way to the American anime Otaku. If you have the old VHS release just closet it and pick this one up.
The only problem is that Discotek/Eastern Star do not put good chapter skips in their stuff. While this is an additional star worthy plus when it allows you to skip the FBI warning at the beginning it loses that same star when you try to skip over the production company to the feature or just try to skip from one chapter's end credits to the next chapter and have to scan back to where it actually started. My opinion is that not having to waste 30 seconds of your life on the FBI warning you have seen thousands of times makes having to scan through end credits worth it.
The prices of ~15-20 dollars for each of their features is also a steal to put these new high quality release classics on your shelf.

I did not give this 5 stars because while it is a classic that any real fan should own, it is not in the same league as the greats like Cowboy Bebop, Akira, Perfect blue, Voices of a Distant Star, etc.",1362009600,44,3208,4.374161073825503
5439313,3,B00AIZ2LR2,"I have to say this anime is so overrated, it portrays crime in the dangerous underground world of American life in New York cit. I just wish the action was better, but other than that I did like the sex scenes in it.",1465516800,,216,4.046511627906977

8552373,4,B00AIZ2LR2,"Ok so I got this for brother, and we watched all four episodes of the OVA. First off this anime is terrible in bad in the it's so terrible it's bad it's good way. This OVA is full of holy crap insane moments, stupid plot, stupid moments, and at time funny bad voice acting. Truly a anime that would come out in the 90's to the English language. This anime is wildly inappropriate and holds back no punches with violence. If you don't want nudity this is not the anime for you.  There is way to much nudity in this thing. However if you can look past it's crazy, inappropriate, and stupid nature you will see this is a piece of crap that was squeezed so hard it turned into a nice shiny gem that puts it into the it's so bad it's good territory. I suggest looking up the plot and then go from there.",1485043200,,798,4.115384615384615
