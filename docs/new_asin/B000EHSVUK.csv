2520250,2,B000EHSVUK,"Slow story that I had trouble keeping interested in it. Pretty bad script and dialog and nothing to make you care about the characters.

This was probably a movie to hype the career of Jimmie Rodgers, but failed.",1384992000,2,212,4.578947368421052
2520251,2,B000EHSVUK,"Saw this on TCM the other day.  OK, for what it is, but not all that good.  A low-budget war flick. Watching Nicholson is somewhat interesting.  As far as the comment on Play Dirty (excellent flick)  check this one out:

2520252,2,B000EHSVUK,"""Back Door to Hell"" is a 1965 low budget war story about the days leading up to MacArthur's return to the Phillipines. The main notable feature is the appearance of Jack Nicholson pre ""Easy Rider"" (1969) and one of the few films of pop singer Jimmie Rodgers (not to be confused with the country singer of the same name).

This was Nicholson's 10th film, all of them well within the low budget genre and undistinguished. Some were worse than others (e.g., ""The Terror"") but none suggested the talent they would later be displayed in ""Easy Rider"" (1969) and, as they say, the rest is history/

Director Monte Hellman (1932) was one of several directors who grew up under Roger Corman in the 60s. Hellman did several films in the 60s (""The Terror"", ""The Shooting"", ""Ride the Whirlwind"") many of them featuring Hellman's good friend and sometimes collaborator Jack Nicholson, himself a protg of Roger Corman. This particular film was one of two Hellman, Nicholson, and co-star and writer John Hackett did in the Philippines, financed by Robert Lippert who specialized in low-budget double bill films.

The top grossing films in 1965 were ""The Sound of Music"", ""Dr. Zhivago"", ""Thunderball"", ""Those Magnificent Men..."", ""That Darn Cat"", and ""The Great Race"". The big Oscar winners were ""The Sound of Music"" (Film, Director), ""Cat Ballou"" (Actor Lee Marvin), and ""Darling"" (Actress Julie Christie). Other notable films that year were ""The Collector"", ""For a Few Dollars More"", ""The Sons of Katie Elder"", ""Battle of the Bulge"", and ""A Patch of Blue""

Take it for what it is - a low budget war film.",1365984000,2,1590,4.899628252788104
2520253,3,B000EHSVUK,"Hey I like that idea about releasing Play Dirty, wheres it at????? I think that movie is awesome, of course it looses its punch after the first viewing but man what a great film for war film buffs. No clue about this movie with the Jackster but its never on TV so it must be pretty bad. Jack was just starting so you can't blame him.",1162425600,3,333,4.0606060606060606
2520254,1,B000EHSVUK,"Boring movie, with very wooden actors.

Give this one a pass over, it took me 3 separate viewings to get through the whole movie. The acting was so monotone it kept putting me to sleep.

It would be nice if they could get some movies on DVD that deserve to be there.
