5974697,4,B00FBRCXKC,"(For those who know about The Good Night Show, feel free to skip to the 3rd paragraph).
This disc from Ncircle Entertainment is quite an interesting addition to its lineup.  To explain WHY it's interesting--well, you might need a little background.
The Goodnight Show (GNS) is the evening offering on Sprout, a 24-hour cable network for preschoolers.  Its name is a bit of a misnomer though, because it's not technically a SHOW, but rather a block of programming--much like Disney Junior is a block on the Disney Channel.  Sprout, however, does something decidedly different with this and other blocks it has, such as The Sunny Side Up Show for mornings, in that the segments between the shows actually have a continuing PLOT, if a loose one. In GNS's case, the block is hosted by a woman named Nina and her puppet pal Star, who live in an elaborate treehouse called the You and Me Tree, and spend their evenings discussing different things, such as camping, circuses, or the Spanish language.  In between episodes of various Sprout shows, Nina and Star do various activities related to the theme, which include yoga exercises, stargazing connect the dots games, and bedtime stories told through sand art. It was Sprout's first block, and is arguably one of its most famous.
This DVD is a collection of 3 GNS ""stories""--which translated means 3 collections of the Nina and Star segments of GNS blocks, with the themes of birthdays, shadows, and gift-giving.  On the surface, this seems like a cash grab on Sprout's part, but if you are a fan of GNS, of course,  you can now visit Nina and Star 24/7 and even  take the show with you on trips when you're away from your cable.  More importantly, for people who may be investigating Sprout, this is a GREAT--and very cheap-way to do it. As a bonus, the Sunny Side Up Show characters of Chica, Carly, and Dennisha make appearances after the Sprout-a-scope stargazing segment of each ""episode.""
There are two slight cons with the disc. One for GNS fans is that the Goodnight Game segment of each block did NOT make the cut on this DVD, most likely to ensure enough space for 3 episodes.  The other, at least for me, is that being an Ncircle DVD, the disc has no menu at all, not even an episode selection.  For parents of preschoolers though, this could very well be a pro--just put it in, and off ya go. :)
So, for Sprout parents--yes, after YEARS of asking, GNS has FINALLY made its way to DVD; in abbreviated form, of course, but it's there.  For those who've heard of Sprout and want to check out how it works, this is $7 well spent.",1392681600,16,2582,4.615720524017467

5974704,2,B00FBRCXKC,"I wasn't familiar with this show so the fact that it annoys me is my own fault for buying without watching a clip first. I find the hostess to be phoney and condescending in tone and that little star puppet just kills me. But the main reason I give this a low rating is this dvd has no root menu. You can't skip and select between episodes and you can't forward through the zillions of previews. Not cool.

Trying to think of something good here...I like that they introduce spanish and sign language. And they reenforce the importance of cleaning up your toys with a catchy doodly-doo song.",1453507200,,591,4.472222222222222

The poor kid started to tear up when it was over. She has autism and Nina and Star were such a big part of our night time routine. We sung the songs and practiced sign language together. She remembered it instantly. We are both so happy to have aninw and Star back. We also listen to ""Nina's"" YouTube books often.

8614204,5,B00FBRCXKC,"Great video for night time for my 1.5 year old. It helps entertain him without stimulating him to sray awoke. He eventually drifts off asleep after a while of watching this video (not because it is boring, as it is actually entertaining) as it is soothing. Even I find the video soothing to watch. The great thing about this video is that the play time is like 1 hour + of episodes and it repeats playing the entire dvd from the beginning automatically at the end of the video. So if I drift off asleep before my child and they somehow are still awoke (this happens occasionally if he napped too long during the day) than I don't have to worry that the video stopped and my child being bored. Great benefit. I wish there were more children's dvds like this.",1476489600,,757,4.375886524822695
