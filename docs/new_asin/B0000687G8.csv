7963959,5,B0000687G8,"Like some others, I watched this documentary mainly because of Susan Walsh's disappearance. I had seen her on an episode of Investigation Discovery's ""Disappeared"". Susan was a dancer and a part-time journalist who was reported missing days after she was filmed in this documentary. ""Stripped"" is much more than a part of Susan's story, as it shows the lives of other dancers and how they came into this profession, and how this job affects them both physically and emotionally. There are some funny moments and some truly sad moments in this doc. I fully recommend it.",1462838400,,569,4.9375
7963960,2,B0000687G8,"I could not watch enough of this to make an assessment of the quality of the documentary.  I am prepared to believe it might be fine, in an extremely gritty home-made VCR kind of way.

But the video quality was just horrible.  Granted, they shipped me a used copy that looked like it had substituted for a hockey puck for a few seasons -- without flagging it as a poor copy in Amazon (shame, shame).

But generally with digital media you either get the complete image or you get nothing, or severely pixelated or scrambled pixel images.  In contrast to that, the kind of horrifically bad video / audio I observed was the type you get from VCR tapes in general, and specifically from ones that have been reused way too many times, then stored near some source of EM radiation (like any cord or cable that carries much current), or else are copies of copies of copies of copies.

Suggest you avoid this one.  I returned it.",1352505600,,921,4.446428571428571
7963961,5,B0000687G8,"This documentary profiles several erotic dancers - most of whom I found to be very sympathetic. The very talented film maker, Ms. Jill Morley has done an excellent job documenting their prospective worlds. The young women are intelligent, educated, and I genuinely liked them all. For this reason, you grow to care about them almost immediately. My reason for purchasing this DVD was because I saw another documentary (on the History Channel no less.) It was about the history of vampires from long ago thru modern times. There was a segment about Susan Walsh who went missing in July of 1996 after researching a piece (about the modern day vampire subculture) she was working on for the Village Voice which they declined to publish. As it turns out,at the time Ms. Walsh had returned to erotic dancing, and she is still missing at this writing! There were numerous articles written speculating on her disappearance and Unsolved Mysteries also did a segment on Susan.  Those who knew her best were absolutely convinced that she would NEVER  just walk away and  leave her son, and based on my research I agree! Friends reported that she felt she was being followed, and she says that very thing in the documentary Stripped. Prior to the vampire project, She had previously done a story about Russian organized crime figures forcing young Russian women to dance in clubs in New York City in the early 90's. She was very apprehensive about her safety after the article was published. Her story was so compelling, I was hooked - hence my interest in Stripped. This is such a well made documentary, and I too saw the G-String Divas series on HBO (like one of the other reviewers)  and am sure this is much more true to life. The thing to come away with here, is that these girls are human beings, not just objects! Ms. Morley is a very talented film maker in my opinion. I was  grateful to have a glimpse into Susan's life after everything I've read about her even though it felt eerie knowing beforehand what was going to happen - except we do not know what happened! Only that she left her 12 year old son with his Dad supposedly for 30 minutes, left the apartment with nothing and never returned. Over the years a friend claimed to have seen her but I don't think this has been properly confirmed. She had begun drinking again, after many years of remaining sober, and was alleged to have been bipolar. If she had overdosed on drugs wouldn't they have found a body? In closing, let me say that this documentary knocked the breath  out of me at the end.  I was not expecting the scene with Angela and her dog to end as it did, and it broke my heart! The way it was filmed will stick with me forever! I am dying to say more but don't want to spoil it. Great Job, Ms. Morley. You have made something you should be proud of forever! If you enjoy documentaries that serve a real slice of life, then I  wholeheartedly recommend this one!",1336176000,,2929,4.544592030360532
7963962,4,B0000687G8,"I will have to say this documentary really is great.  It is especially great for anyone who is enamored with going to strip clubs to seek satisfaction from giving a woman their money in exchange for seductive acceptance.

These are the profiles of desperate women who are burdened by insecurities from their past, seeking to gain self-acceptance by proving that they have what it takes to be flamboyant, thereby eliciting shock to those that they've been close to.  Some of these women are older and very jaded, and it's apparent by the collective tone that they hate their career as a stripper but feel trapped and must milk it until they can no longer.  It's very apparent that they are desensitized and incapable of having a satisfying, normal monogamous relationship with anyone.  These dancers by and large- with the exception of Jill- are not really that likable, and it's difficult to imagine anyone giving them much in the way of their time or money.  I found it very difficult to empathize with most of the characters.  One woman who was interviewed with her boyfriend present recounted a time when she was dancing for her father, and she had to force herself to not touch herself in a sexual manner.  The boyfriend, who seemed like a complete moron, got a cheap thrill as he actually began telling the story.  Another dancer talked about how men's hands felt to her like sandpaper without money in them, and how she would advise her clients to keep her at ease by making sure that if they did touch her, that it was with the paper currency in their hands.  She seemed to infer that her breast cleavage was a cash register slot.

I sort of chuckled at the overtones expressed by the interviewees in this documentary; how they aren't right for the corporate world, tried to make a living as an artist but could not, or dignify their predicament by saying that they are in school and just need the money.  They blame their desperation on having been ostracized by their conservative fathers, or on having experienced rejection when they tried out as a Broadway dancer, leaving them with no esteem in either instance.  The common denominator across all of the women profiled in this documentary is that they are deeply flawed in some way, and are desperate to make a quick buck at the expense of some suckers who think these women are all about them.  The dancers actually ridicule their clientele, joking about the facade they present to get the most money they can.  It's ironic that these women work in a profession that caters to the desires of men, yet they mock them with contempt.  Of course the angle of the documentary isn't to show how these men they speak of, their customers, are classy upstanding family men, but rather to show how they are in fact exploiting these women who pretend to want them, and how these clients are perpetuating their everyday return to this godawful profession.

The best thing this documentary does is shine a bright light on a sick and delusional industry.  The profession itself- a sexy woman seductively exposing her breasts to a man in exchange for money- really is not.  It's more so the portrayal of these women working as strippers as normal people who have normal families and are in normal committed relationships.  It's the delusion that stripping is a great career alternative to working in a corporate environment, and that the power you have while seducing a man as a dancer is far less demeaning than rejection on Broadway.  It's the delusions of the women who believe that this is a great way to fix financial woes quickly.  And most of all, it's the delusions of the poor sucker fishing a dollar bill through the G-string of some jaded broad who couldn't care less about him.",1277078400,2,3737,4.699386503067485
7963963,5,B0000687G8,"I've seen this film several times and every time it's made me laugh...and cry. Director Jill Morley gives us honest-as-hell, fully rendered portraits of 5 dancers who emerge as funny, smart women dealing with different degrees of emotional damage. Along the way we meet the male characters that populate this world, from the illusion-free sweetheart who drives his ""girls"" to and from the clubs to the tipsy customer who tells Jill, ""I would never sleep with a go-go dancer...I'd bleep her and go home!"" A very entertaining and insightful film.",1141171200,4,544,5.055555555555555
7963964,4,B0000687G8,"Since Jill Morley worked as a dancer she tells the true story of the profession. If you don't want to spoil the illusion or fantasy about women in this profession then this isn't the film for you. It is about women on the job and like most jobs some hate it and some love it but mainly they are there to make a living just like everyone else. This film is not about the titilation you get from most films on the subject but about real people with real lives. (Some of which are tragic.) So if you are interested in a truthful look behind the glitter this is for you.
 Now I can hardly wait for Ms. Morley's next film which will be about the neo-burlesque movement.",1066867200,7,664,4.1875
7963965,5,B0000687G8,"Finally, a doc that tells the truth about strippers!!!
I used to dance, so this film really appealed to me.  The women were sexy, fascinating, and intelligent.  It was cool to see how articulate women view the industry.
Last year, I watched G-String Divas in horror!  There was not one ounce of truth in it.  Just a softcore service for its viewers.  STRIPPED drives home the reasons why women dance, why it's soooo hard for them to quit and how it can be quite addictive in so many ways.  Very moving and insightful.
Thanks for making a movie like this!!!!  If anyone wants to be blown away by truthful storytelling abut this industry, BUY STRIPPED!
Bravo Jill!!!
