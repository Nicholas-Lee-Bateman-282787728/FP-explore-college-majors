3489884,3,B001BEJ4J2,"I got this because N. Reedus was in it and in that regard it does not disappoint.  The rest however was just not engaging.  Maybe I am not deep enough but I never cared about the characters and what happened to them.  They could live or die, he could get the girl or not, I didn't even care what was in the box.  It's supposed to be a slightly mistical journey, but I wasn't rooting for anyone to get there.
I enjoyed the sets, made me wish I had lived in a train car, still time for that I guess.  If you have the super power of making mountains out of mole hills, your gonna love this.",1370822400,,587,3.982905982905983
3489885,4,B001BEJ4J2,I ordered this for someone else so I'm not sure how good the movie is. The case and disc were both in good condition and were delivered on time.,1342396800,,144,4.0
3489886,5,B001BEJ4J2,"I think most reviews have stated what this film is about, so all I have to say is that when I found it I just had to have it. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed, I really enjoyed it. Norman Reedus performance was great as I had only seen him in ""TBS"", it was nice to see him in this.",1278892800,,293,3.6666666666666665
3489887,5,B001BEJ4J2,I'm so happy this movie has come to DVD. I've told numerous people about this film only to have to tell them it wasn't out on DVD. It is poetry on celluloid. Norman Reedus as Nick Nero and Mark Boone Junior as Nick Beat how could you possibly go wrong. Not to mention Eric Roberts can play creepy like nobody's business. There wasn't a single role that wasn't played to perfection. Nor was there a shot that wasn't beautiful. Add in the great soundtrack and you've got gold. You won't find a movie quiet like it. You should definitely give it a try you won't be sorry.,1271289600,,568,4.317757009345795
3489888,4,B001BEJ4J2,"This movie was filmed some time ago b ut just recently released for public consumption. Definitely worth checking out, Interesting to see how much the actors have changed. Eric Roberts is characteristically creepy. Norman Reedus does a great job as the main character.",1270512000,,268,5.255813953488372
3489889,5,B001BEJ4J2,"As a huge fan of ""The Boondock Saints"" I assumed that I would also love ""The Beatnicks""...and my assumption was right! Norman Reedus puts on a great performance - definitely made the film a great one. This film highlights the struggles of two young men trying to make it in Los Angeles. This film is extremely enjoyable and fun to watch. You end up rooting for the main characters as if they were your friends. Not only is the movie extremely laid back and cool, but it also has a great soundtrack! This film is sure to develop a strong cult following.",1268956800,,552,4.421568627450981
3489890,5,B001BEJ4J2,"Its no surprise that The Beatnicks finally gets a home DVD release in the year that Jean-Jacques Beineix's director's cut of Betty Blue finally gets the attention it deserves. Some times the good things take time, I guess.

A quarter of a century later traces of Jean Jacques Beineix's Diva and Betty Blue can be found in The Beatnicks exquisite cinematography, luscious composition and rich, atmospheric perspectives.  With a suave anti hero in the shape of Nick Nero played by a louche Norman Reedus and the sexy, evanescent Elodie Bouchez as Nica (foxy kohl eyeliner - check; hot French accent - check) get ready to reset your parameters for this engaging and expansive, arthouse caper.

Reedus is outstanding in his role as Nick Nero. He possesses that rare ability to superbly deliver a well placed comic turn with existential angst and seduces us with his wise-beyond-his-years whisper of beat poetry, ""I walked into your ocean, freed like a slave, Lay down in your waters, like a shallow grave"".

There's some wonderful Buddhist weirdness going on too involving ice cold baths for Mark Boone Jnr. where we get to glimpse the deathless nature of the ultimate. Then Eric Roberts turns up waving a gun around and generally bossing folks around in his dressing gown in the Frank Lloyd Wright house from Bladerunner, yep, THAT Frank Lloyd Wright house. You begin to suspect that this film is potentially more self referential than Blue Velvet - and that's a fact that only recommends it yet further.

This is such a beautifully made film created very much in the European cinema tradition but with a story that is firmly rooted in the slightly altered but seductively sublime united states of The Beatnicks.",1268352000,,1709,4.920138888888889
3489891,5,B001BEJ4J2,"The Beatnicks is one of the strangest and most unique indie flicks I've seen in a long time. Its dreamlike sequences and quirky characters definitely makes it a must-see for anyone who's into great independent comedies.

The film stars both Norman Reedus and Mark Boone Jr. as Nick Nero and Nick Beat, respectively. Both are struggling artists looking to hit it big, and risk becoming homeless in the process. Down on their luck and struggling to find that one special gig, they find a hidden treasure buried by a strange little monkey.

This treasure chest of infinite beats gives them the chance to turn their life around, but Nero could lose it all when he becomes entangled with Nica (lodieBouchez), the fianc of mafioso nightclub owner Mack Drake (Eric Roberts).

One gig at the Monkey Club can decide their fate and the true origin of the treasure chest.
Both Reedus and Boone Jr. deliver phenomenal performances early in their career, considering the movie was made in 2000. Check it out. It's well worth it.",1268265600,6,1015,4.82183908045977
3489892,5,B001BEJ4J2,"With an underground fanbase of thousands of people, the star power of people like Norman Reedus, Mark Boone Jr., Elodie Bouchez, and Eric Roberts, ""The Beatnicks"" is one of those movies that exemplifies a ""cult hit"".

""The Boondock Saints"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, so when I heard that Reedus was in another film that came out around the same time, I knew I had to see it.

It's a really cool film with a laid-back feel about two guys (named Nick) trying to make it in LA. They finally get their big break, encounter some romance, and begin to see their true purpose in life.

Eric Roberts is great as Mack Drake, a hardened LA club-owner, and Elodie Bouchez plays his wife who gets a little too close to one of the Nicks.

If you're looking for an entertaining independent film, with a lot of great star power and an awesome soundtrack, ""The Beatnicks"" is definitely for you.",1268179200,4,890,4.509316770186335
3489893,5,B001BEJ4J2,"This is a great movie definitly different from other movies. Norman Reedus did an amazing job in this movie. This movie has a dark feel to it and so do the characters.

The Beat Nicks are musician Nick Nero(Norman Reedus) and poet Nick Beat(Mark Boone Junior), a pair of self-styled truth-seekers who'd better find a gig or they'll be out on the street. Their luck begins to change when they find a box on the beach, a treasure chest of infinite beats that will set the stage for the ultimate success, a gig at the Monkey Club. But when Nick Nero falls in love with Nica(lodie Bouchez), the club owners captive bride, he learns that they are some truths better left unsought. Hard knocks and a trip to rock bottom reunites the Nicks to preform the gig of a lifetime, and return the box to its source.

I'd recommend this movie to others definitly.",1260748800,9,847,4.4935064935064934

8282774,4,B001BEJ4J2,"I enjoyed this movie, but I think you need a really artsy, creative vibe to get the full effect. Reedus does a fantastic job, as always, but the pace of the movie was a little slow for me at times. If you're looking for a fast-paced, entertaining film that you can just sit back and enjoy without engaging your brain, this is not the movie for you. It provokes thoughts and feelings on so many different levels and demands that the viewer engage with the character and the storyline. Maybe have a couple shots of bourbon before you hit play.",1423872000,,541,4.42
8282775,1,B001BEJ4J2,"Wanted some Norman Reedus in the off season and I enjoy quirky and offbeat independents but this was a waste of a movie night. Maybe I didn't read the description closely but the box is some weird mystical/magical thing and the story is really 2 plots of the 2 Nicks.  Strange and bizarre new age/Eastern philosophy/hippy stuff that really goes nowhere.  They aren't musicians, persay, rather poetry set to music.  None of it was really cohesive and it just went around back to where they started.  I tracked this down through an interlibrary loan and feel even the drive over to the library was a waste of gas and time. It's only redeeming qualities were Norman Reedus and if you like poetry there are some good lines in the couple performances they do.  Otherwise, it feels like a bad trip, which I think whoever put this together was on.",1421625600,,840,4.610738255033557

8282778,2,B001BEJ4J2,"I thought that the plot of this story fell flat. I did not care for it, so my advice is do NOT spend your money on this movie. I do like Norman Reedus and his is always easy on the eyes to watch, but the movie itself was NOT good.",1379721600,,230,3.62
8282779,4,B001BEJ4J2,The movie in general was okay. It had good performances from Norman Reedus and Mark Boone Junior as the two Nicks but in all it really felt like the movie was just lacking something. The ending really wasn't an ending in my opinion. I think it would have done better for me if it hadn't been for that fact.,1374451200,,306,4.203389830508475
