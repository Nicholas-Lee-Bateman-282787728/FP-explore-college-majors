8719611,5,B00Z8DVWWY,"This is the best film by Joe D'Amato who made some really good ones. Grief, greed and jealousy can be a toxic mix, and nowhere more toxic than in this film. A killer  goes on the rampage and the first victim seems to have supernatural undercurrrents, as the cosy existence of a small Italian town should be turned upside down. The most striking thing about this movie is the acting by a relatively undiscovered cast who involve you emotionally in every aspect of the pretty realistic horror. Rumours that this film caused theatrical walkouts are not just rumours, the timing in one scene in particular backs up what I have always thought, that slow steady  clear camera work and selective repetition are the most sure ways of frightening an audience. There are not many extras, but they are all educational  if you are a gorehound or scream queen,and the sexy menu indicates what ingredients will be in the film. If you enjoy this title try Antropophagus, Inside(A L'IInterieure), Maniac(2013), and No One Lives. And someone please, please, please bully Warner or MGM into releasing the longest negative of Fistful Of Dollars on Bluray. It will be a great moneyspinner because audiences are now ready for it.
