According to the product description (and the back of the DVD case), ""All the character and color of the 19th Century Oberndorf Germany comes alive...""

The problem is that it's Austria; not Germany so that's the first thing wrong with the DVD before you even begin to play it.

The story puts a lot of emphasis on the Alpine roads between Oberndorf and Salzburg. They don't exist. The film features riding up and down the Alps in a horse-drawn sleigh, an avalanche, mountain climbing, and skiing. It looks nice in the story but there's no mountain between the two locations and no hill big enough to have a ski slope. Those Alpine roads simply don't exist anywhere near Oberndorf's flat river plain.

The story insists that Gruber never wrote another piece of music. He wrote hundreds, included carols, hymns, and masses. The choir is shown singing ""Silent Night"" with no instruments playing. The carol was actually written to be played on a guitar. There's no guitar in sight in this fairytale.

I have no problem with fairytales, but when a children's story is based on real life, it should state the true story.",1168473600,,1136,4.746192893401015
