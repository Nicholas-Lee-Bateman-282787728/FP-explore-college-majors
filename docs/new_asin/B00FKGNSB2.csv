8616298,4,B00FKGNSB2,"This is a film that will make you think, maybe reaffirm unconscious stereotypes or prejudices and possibly question your liberalism, or that might just be me. Based on the real life accounts of an all black boy crew who mugged other children on around 40 occasions in 2006 - 2008. They used the little brother scam, saying that the phone the other kids had was one of their little brothers and then using the whole group to act good cop, bad cop and eventually fleece their younger and less numerous victims of what ever they could get away with.

The shots are all static; it takes a while for you to notice; the action all takes place within a single framed shot, often with action taking place outside of the camera but with all the main events happening in the actual frame. It sounds disconcerting but actually adds to the sense of voyeurism and the documentary feel as sometimes dialogue is either muffled or over lapped. The entire scenes seem to have been done in one take which must have been challenging; little John Ortiz playing John is particularly good, but all of the young actors put in excellent performances.

Music is minimal but when used it works to great effect, the Native American dancers and singers being particularly wonderful. Some shots or even whole scenes seem disjointed but I think that is because the whole film is a collage conveying messages about immigration, racism and the aforementioned stereo types. It is a hard watch in places as the little kids are bullied, but they do make it seem very real. In Swedish and a running time just shy of two hours it is not an enjoyable film, but it will stay with you and it will, probably, make you think.",1386115200,,1683,4.588039867109635
