4188087,2,B003SFKT5U,"Some nice scenery, but really too brief to provide much detail on so many rivers.",1415318400,,81,4.466666666666667
4188088,5,B003SFKT5U,This is an OUTSTANDING European River Cruise Tour Guide. Burt Wolf takes you to the places that are most seen on the River Cruises. This was very helpful in deciding if we were going to go on extra excursions.,1402963200,,209,4.384615384615385
4188089,5,B003SFKT5U,Burt Wolfe makes me want to pack my bags and join his trips. The scenery is breathtaking and his narration very interesting.,1398297600,,124,4.681818181818182
4188090,3,B003SFKT5U,"Nice scenery, some good information, but seems just a step above a good amature. Not the least bit exciting. We have this trip planned, and this video is not something that is getting me excited about going. Maybe it shows the best the trip has to offer, but I have been told differently.",1397606400,,288,4.452830188679245
4188091,5,B003SFKT5U,"Burt Wolf's River Cruises DVD is an excellent way to see the sights along the great rivers of Europe without the expense.  You are introduced to the major attractions at the stops along with Burt's humorous, offbeat commentaries thrown in.  My wife and I are planning to take one of these river cruises so we used this DVD to decide which river cruise to take as well as the cruise line that offered what we wanted.  Great investment we can use over and over for enjoyment.",1389052800,,473,4.476744186046512
4188092,5,B003SFKT5U,"THIS will be enjoyed by everyone. On this wonderful river cruise, you are shown everything that there is to see. Walk the narrow streets of the quaint little villages of Germany. Be amazed at the medieval castles you will be seeing, some of these castles have evil historys. You will also be seeing plenty of colorful delicious food and drinks while on shore. The scenery is magnificent. The water is blue. The places most interesting.  You will be wanting to get up and go too. I was very interested in grand buildings i saw. Many were very medieval looking, and took me back in time. The photography in the DVD was just beautiful. I wished to see more of the ship-board life on these special cruise boats. After all, isn't that half the fun of the cruise? Not too much was shown of life on board the boat itself.  This documentary mainly concentrated on all the shore excusions. Sadly, the luxury cruise boat was mainly left out.  For everyone interested in travel, this is a must see. I found it to be a great experence. And after watching GREAT RIVER CRUISES OF EUROPE. I will be saving to make a booking, and cruiseing the great rivers of Europe too.",1353456000,7,1155,4.516746411483253
4188093,3,B003SFKT5U,"It's not that Burts travel DVD is bad.

It's just I expected more river cruising views....like views from the ship as their cruising along.

Sipping from a glass of wine on deck at sunset while coming into the next port. With lights beginning to shine in the port city would have been so cool.

Then, of course, show whats in the city during the day.

What we have here is BOOM....were in the city....then BOOM.....were in the NEXT city. Kind of boring to me maybe BECAUSE it wasn't what I expected and was in a disappointed state.

Missed opportunity to create a great mood to traveling.",1348531200,16,588,4.509433962264151
4188094,5,B003SFKT5U,Burt Wolf makes you want to cash in your savings and book a trip to Europe.  He is charming and informative about the history of his destinations.  The photography is stunning.,1344988800,6,176,4.645161290322581
4188095,5,B003SFKT5U,"We are considering a river cruise next spring in Europe. This DVD was both informative and enjoyable. It gave us a little peek into what we will be experiencing next year. Great color, clear speaking, no technical problems with the DVD. Appeared currant and not dated. Burt Wolf has a wonderful sense of humor. We'll probably watch it again.",1333497600,13,341,4.796610169491525
8404235,5,B003SFKT5U,"I love travel videos, it's the best way to get myself to ride my exercise bike faithfully!  This one had great photography and made me want to take a cruise vacation (and I get seasick - so maybe I'll just bike my way along those river cruises)",1528243200,,244,4.191489361702128

8404239,1,B003SFKT5U,"This DVD is mostly about eating and drinking.  If there were no more to Europe than shown in this video, I wouldn't have a reason to go.  While Mr. Wolf did spend 30 seconds in the Musee Dorsay, and he does a quick walk-by of as few opera and classical music venues, his affection is obviously reserved for chocolate, beer, wine, pastries and hard liquor, which occupy most of his time.  Of course his escapades are peppered with pseudo-jokes that fall completely flat.  If all you want is alcohol and high calorie deserts, raid a bakery and a liquor store and pig out  while watching a competent stand-up comedian on your DVD.  Cruising European rivers would be completely irrelevant.",1480464000,,685,4.714285714285714
