5968815,4,B00F6WXPD6,Will take several times to actually get this down unless your already a dancer. But it's fun and you certainly work up a sweat.,1407196800,4,127,4.333333333333333
5968816,4,B00F6WXPD6,"I have a large collection of workout DVDs, but the most ""dancey"" one I had was Paula Abdul from the 90s (it's pretty great, really!).
Anyhow, I purchased this for something different. It is challenging, but after several attempts you start getting the hang of it.
I appreciate the difficulty; nothing is worse than a bland routine! Of course I felt ridiculous while doing this because I am not a dancer by any means.
I also like the fact that there are 4 workouts in one. They are short, appx 20 minutes each, and you can customize, choosing however many you want. The music is peppy, so that's a bonus.
The things I don't like are that it's pretty obvious the kids are not professional instructors. The dude is better at it than the gal.  They don't know how to really *teach*, they just sorta *do*. Don't get me wrong, they do try, it's OK, it's just not the best.
 Also, during the final breakdown, it is music only with no verbal cues.
There is no warm up or cool down, which is fine by me, but I thought I'd throw that in there :)
The ""bonus"" is them facing the other direction so you see them from the back, and they go thru just the dances a few times without the step-by-step guidance. This way, you can get a pretty good workout once you get the dances memorized.
It was very frustrating at first, but overall I really enjoyed it. So much that I ordered a few more Dance-style DVDs!",1395446400,20,1391,4.325670498084291
5968817,4,B00F6WXPD6,This is a good follow up exercise DVD to the first Step Up DVD.  I was sweating during the first dance break down.  I add the dance DVDs onto my workouts at the end because I generally don't get a good workout just doing the dance DVD workout...hope that makes some sense.,1392508800,2,272,4.211538461538462

5968820,2,B00F6WXPD6,"The dance moves are fairly complicated for someone as uncoordinated as I am!  I thought this would be more of a work out, but after learning the moves I hadn't broken a sweat.  This could be fun for someone looking to learn some new hip-hop moves, but it's not a good workout.",1426464000,,276,4.288461538461538
5968821,5,B00F6WXPD6,My daughter loved this Christmas present! Great price. Fast service.,1423180800,,68,5.9
5968822,1,B00F6WXPD6,"If you work out very much, you will be very frustrated with this DVD.  Most of the DVD is instruction, learning the dance moves.  You don't burn a lot of energy or calories doing this.  The ""dancing"" part is only about two minutes long.  So, after you learn the moves, you are left with about 10 useable minutes, when I was hoping for at least an hour workout.  Very disappointing!",1422921600,8,381,4.385714285714286
5968823,4,B00F6WXPD6,"I first borrowed this DVD from a public library
to use in my class at a non-profit youth organi-
zation after-school program.  I ended up keeping
this DVD out for over 6 weeks because the boys
and girls of every grade (1st thru 7th) loved
exercising with it. So I purchased it.
The youths look forward to working out
with this video. The steps are explained,
practiced and repetitive,giving viewers the
opportunity to learn the steps.  It was
a good investment. I even use it
for personal workouts at home!  Please
keep in mind it is an exercise/workout video.",1421712000,,560,4.636363636363637
5968824,4,B00F6WXPD6,"Nice Video steps. A bit to fast to follow sometimes but well, it is hip hop but definitely, length is too short",1419638400,2,111,4.090909090909091

I just bought this and it didn't work there is a problem with the product",1490745600,,79,4.0
8612752,2,B00F6WXPD6,Only 2 star from me only cause i didn't like it...to hard to follow,1486252800,,67,3.857142857142857
8612753,4,B00F6WXPD6,Just wish the workouts were longer (35-45 minutes would be great).,1485302400,,66,5.090909090909091
8612754,5,B00F6WXPD6,"Great way to get in some exercise throughout the day.  Quick 15 min. sessions are a breeze, yet effective and just downright fun!",1461715200,,129,4.608695652173913
8612755,3,B00F6WXPD6,Fun video but for me it was hard to follow. My friend who is much more coordinated did way better.,1458259200,,98,3.95
8612756,5,B00F6WXPD6,Quick shipping and as described!,1455062400,,32,5.6
8612757,5,B00F6WXPD6,The DVD arrived quickly. The packaging was perfect. I brought out the whole family to try it. The dances aren't for beginners but the music and moves are fun if you can keep up,1453939200,,176,4.205882352941177
8612758,4,B00F6WXPD6,"If you aren't really coordinated or don't have a dance background you may struggle since the explanation part is very fast and then the segments build on each other (like most exercise DVDs). I was able to pick up the routines with only a little rewind but as the linked/looped sequence got longer and longer, towards the end (last 20%?) I would forget what came next.  It would probably take 4-5 times before you would have the sequence fully memorized.

But this is definitely hip hop and the routines have definitely been designed by a hip hop dancer. It was fun, challenging and after I mastered the routines, it was fun to run through.

The only negative issue is I was only lightly perspiring by the end and not panting and out of breath so if you are trying to squeeze in a heart pumping short exercise session, this isn't the right DVD for you. It is for someone who wants to get some mid-level calorie burn exercise while learning hip hop.",1448064000,,948,4.5
8612759,1,B00F6WXPD6,"This is not what you think.  This is a DVD to teach you four dance routines and nothing else.  It does not provide any type of exercie routine. If you're looking for a hip hop dance routine that is also an exercise routine, this is not it.",1430697600,3,239,4.0638297872340425
