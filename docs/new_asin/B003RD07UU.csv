The end of the 19th century was marked by many assassinations by anarchists and other political driven societies. Could there be an organization that kills people for hire? Sonia Winter, a reporter, visits a small business to investigate it and hire it for a job. A marvelous idea? A bargain price? 20,000. She meets the price. The owner assembles the Board of Directors and tells of this commission. Is the Board expendable? Who would be Ivans successor? Hardly the act of a gentleman. [Yes, its a comedy.] They accept this sporting proposition. Sonia talks to her publisher. [Surprise!] They show an old movie from that era. The scene shifts to Paris and a Pleasure Palace, a place of assignation! Is there a misunderstanding? Shots are fired! Carry on, gentlemen. There are comic scenes.

All problems are capable of solutions says Ivan. The police raid this respectable hotel. There is an explosive event. The young women there are taken for a ride. Sonia and Ivan go on a train ride. Ivan meets Popescu, there is another surprise. In Zurich an old peddler brings a small trunk to a bank (for more comedy). Sonia brings a small briefcase to the director. The Assassination Bureau is a political weapon to control governments. Elsewhere in Vienna there is a parade of cavalry in the Emperors plaza. The Crown Prince is shot! People dance and celebrate while were young. A waiter brings a black blood sausage, but Ivan passes it on. He now knows how he was followed. They travel to Venice. Ivan visits a man, but he has gone. He watches the wife and drinks some wine. Then something happens! There is another surprise for Miss Winter. Later she learns he has drowned and identifies the body.

There is a funeral. Lord Bostley arrives. So too General von Pink. Has Miss Winters outlived her usefulness? Not yet. Lord Bostley inspects the coffin. Another surprise! La Signorina gets paid off. The effect of the assassination is to start a general war. The crowned heads of Europe assemble in a castle for a conference. Can anyone set off an explosive bomb in this remote and well-guarded castle? Yes, from a Zeppelin! It takes to the air with an extra passenger and heads towards the castle. Can it be stopped? There is a saber fight aboard this ship! A pistol shot causes a fire and the Zeppelin burns and crashes! (Flammable hydrogen gas was used.) Will Ivan be rewarded for his good works? There is a happy ending for the good guys. Life is a precious thing.

This is based on a story by Jack London. I didn't read the story but doubt is it was a comedy. This is worth watching as a comedy based on the historical events of the early 20th century. It is not a commentary on the origins of the Great War, its too silly. It makes the point how an organization can be controlled by the powerful men of a country and used to further its policies. For a better story about an assassination bureau watch The Parallax View, a drama based on actual events. The book Seven Men at Daybreak tells about an historical assassination.",1427673600,,3060,4.661111111111111

8403564,3,B003RD07UU,"This movie is not a bomb, it's a movie about bombs and bombers. And it should pique your curiosity because The Assassination Bureau offers adventure moments (bombs and chases in London, Paris, Venice and Vienna), action scenes (zeppelin versus castle), comedy parts (disguises and inventive assassinations) and, at least, eroticism (Diana Rigg with Victorian underwears and the visit of a brothel in Paris). A very good surprise. Recommended.",1322179200,,442,5.514705882352941
