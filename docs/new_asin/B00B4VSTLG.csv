8562511,1,B00B4VSTLG,"Cindy Reese (Valerie Bauer) is in trouble with the law. She tells her story to Dr. Robbins (Tisha Tinsman). It seems our lovely blond was an ugly brainy unpopular high school student who had to go to community college. Here she meets her only friend in the world, Bella (Katherine Mesa) because Bella always means trouble in the movies. Bella is into drugs, prostitution, night clubs and has mafia connections. Cindy is obsessed with Bella and gets drawn into her world.

The film actually sounds better than what it is. The production has that Super VHS look to it. The opening credits were done cheaply and the sound wasn't crisp. Valerie Bauer couldn't deliver her lines and when she ""cried"" it was terribly fake. There isn't a lot of good excitement and I have no idea what the DVD art work has to do with the film.

Might have some chick appeal. I thought it bordered on MST bad.
