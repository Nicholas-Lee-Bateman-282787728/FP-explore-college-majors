8415946,4,B004479ECU,"This is the Portuguese language release of Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" aka Book 2 of the Millennium Trilogy.  Yes, I'm a Millennium Trilogy elitist: I read the the three books well before they became a publishing phenomenon (ordered each hard-cover direct from Amazon UK well before the US publications); I was a big fan of the first movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo/dp/B003FBNJ4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</a>) and saw it on the US release day; I think Noomi Rapace is the perfect Lisbeth; and I regularly harangue people that it's absurd to re-make the movies in English because they deserve to be seen in their native Swedish tongue.

However, I'm not blind to the fact that the cinematic adaptation of the second book falls short of the standard set by the first movie.  Perhaps the change in directors had something to do with that.  Though the three films were filmed back-to-back-to-back, Denmark's Niels Arden Oplev helmed the first installment, while Swede Daniel Alfredson took over for Parts II and III.  Oplev's 'Dragon Tattoo' crackles with suspense, makes great use of technology (love how Mikael pieces together the parade photographs) and portrays the sadistic violence perpetrated against Lisbeth in no-holds-barred, nothing-left-to-the-imagination fashion.  And when Lisbeth gets her stunning revenge against her erstwhile guardian, Nils Bjurman, Oplev stages his single best scene.  Watch the veins pop out of Rapace's neck as she (how to say this?) turns the table on her sodomizer.

Maybe Alfredson has less to work with: Book II has a slightly transitory feel to get to us to the third installment, and Lisbeth's 'crawling out of the grave' thing is a bit over the top.  But the movie feels listless compared to thrill ride of Oplev's finished product.  Alfredson's movie is a bit over two hours.  Oplev's was over two-and-a-half (the domestic Swedish release, in fact, clocked a full three hours).  I would have liked an extra 30+ minutes to take more time on any of Larsson's famous deep dives.  One thought would be to play up the misguided police manhunt railroading Lisbeth and prejudging her as member of a lesbian sadist cult.  This police malfeasance foreshadows ""Hornet's Nest.""  Instead, we get rat-a-tat-tat: murder; Lisbeth fingered (literally); Lisbeth sought; Lisbeth goes underground; Lisbeth tries to clear her name.

I do like that we got more of Lena Endre here.  Her Erika Berger was shortchanged in Oplev's take, and she steps a bit more to the front here.  And for the first time, we see that Erika and Mikael have a personal as well as work relationship.  I felt like Oplev neutered his Mikael, winnowing his relationships down only to Lisbeth in the film while in Larsson's tale he juggles three.  Alfredson makes the relationship clearer.  It's important because Erika plays a major part of Book III.",1287792000,,2976,5.2760084925690025
