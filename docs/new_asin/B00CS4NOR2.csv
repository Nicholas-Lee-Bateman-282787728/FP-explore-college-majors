5737271,5,B00CS4NOR2,"I have tried several different types of indoor training DVDs. These are my favorite. The workout is great, the instructors are motivating, the video/scenery also keeps my mind off of my dark, dank basement. While not quite like the open road, it gets the job done when there is three feet of snow outside my window. I own the France, Italy and Hawaii DVDs.",1374537600,,356,4.578125
8585535,3,B00CS4NOR2,"It's okay, but there are better virtual cycling DVD options out there.  I disliked the fact that the camera crew is mostly too close to the group in front, which prevents view of the scenery ahead.  Also, why look back?  I don't ride looking back.  Film quality is not the best.  Music is pretty good.",1409702400,,301,4.4
8585536,3,B00CS4NOR2,You can't ride double sided on the roads in Kauai. They don't ride safely. Need to sjow that even filming videos.,1391904000,,113,4.428571428571429
8585537,3,B00CS4NOR2,Lovely scenery. Good quality CD's. Good narration. It may be enjoyed by casual cyclists but not for a serious cyclist. My husband watched it once - ironman is a whole other level. I make use of it occasionally as I ride 30 minutes on a Kiser resistance cycle each morning so it is not wasted in our collection. Sorry for the mediocre rating - not their fault - important to know what you are purchasing.,1391472000,,403,4.386666666666667
8585538,3,B00CS4NOR2,"Expectation:  like cycling class with clear instructions and inspiration, but with nice scenery at home.

Reality:  great scenery (definitely a plus!) but the audio tracks are pretty bad...there is no clear instruction for at home resistance setting on any of the three tracks.  One track is focused on outdoor riding tips (wtf? I'm watching this at home...) and the other two are echoing, muffled, and minus any actual instruction.

Alternatives:  although not in DVD format (and kindof cheesy) the Sufferfest videos are much more clearly articulated, are cheaper, and also feature scenery and group riding video.",1386633600,,614,5.34375
8585539,5,B00CS4NOR2,"Weather you are a beginner looking for inspiration or an advanced rider who loves to crush endless hills, this video is a must see!  Too busy riding outside this summer?  Get it for your indoor rides which are only a few months away.  The scenery is amazing.",1375920000,,258,4.446808510638298
8585540,5,B00CS4NOR2,What a great ride.  Lots of scenery and the music keeps me on pace.  It really feels like I have been in Hawaii and completed a terrific ride a the end of the video.  Will purchase others.,1375747200,,188,4.027027027027027
8585541,5,B00CS4NOR2,I only wish it was twice as long and went into the hike at the end.  Just fantastic!  I look forward to the others.,1375574400,,115,3.75
8585542,5,B00CS4NOR2,Amazing ride with Global Ride. Images breathtaking. Climbs burning legs. Turns and runs amazing! WOW! Thank you for taking the tmeps create these visual delights to inspire us in our internal training!,1375142400,,201,5.3125
8585543,5,B00CS4NOR2,Global Rides did an excellent job with this DVD.  It's quickly become one of my favorites due to the great coaching and engaging music.  The scenery is great and it is an excellent work out.,1374624000,,190,4.4
8585544,5,B00CS4NOR2,This Cycling virtual ride is very well done. Good cues and directions. The scenery is wonderful and my classes were absorbed right into the screen as if they were there with the riders!,1374537600,,185,4.636363636363637
