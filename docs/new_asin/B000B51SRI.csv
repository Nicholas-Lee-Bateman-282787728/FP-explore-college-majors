2399670,3,B000B51SRI,"The videos are very specific about each topic but the instructor is a bit hard to follow because sometimes he speaks too fast and keeps making references to other video lessons. This makes it hard to follow because the students have not seen the previous videos, and if so, often they do not remember it all. This is a good video for people using it as a refresher, but not for a classroom to support a lesson. I tried them in the classroom and the kids were lost after a few minutes and I had to keep stopping and repeating the sections for them to just follow the whole lesson. The honor classes didn't have a problem with it though, neither did I.

The video and sound are very clear, the picture is stable, and you just listen and watch while a teacher who knows his stuff and knows how to explain it takes you though the subject matter.  You can pause, rewind, and watch parts over as many times as you want.  You can pause and try stuff on your own with pencil and paper, or search the web or your own books for other explanations to complement what he's saying.  That's one of the great things about self-paced learning.

It's a great alternative to Kaplan, Princeton review etc for Standardized test prep etc.  The problems he selects are excellent and he does a great job of taking things step by step.  I have looked at siminlar products and text books - and they all assume that you know too much and they skip steps or neglect to explain entire portions of method.

2399680,4,B000B51SRI,"The DVDs in ""The Trigonometry And Pre-Calculus Tutor"" show Jason Gibson solving mathematical problems from those courses.  Jason works the ""crank-turning"" type of problem.  He doesn't explain the conceptual basis for the mathematics.  (This isn't like a high school math class taught by Dr. Millbee; it's like a class taught by Coach Glonther.)  Jason's terminology may originate with secondary school teachers who are desperate that their students acquire some capability with the material, but some of it is not correct mathematical terminology.  For example, he promotes a concept of ""opposites"" instead of speaking precisely about ""inverse functions"".

The entire video uses one camera angle, which shows Jason working at the marker board.  There are no fancy computer graphics to illustrate mathematical ideas.  Jason is well prepared.  He speaks clearly.  His presentation is spontaneous. It is also very organized and smooth.  He has the habit of saying ""OK?"" every few seconds, but even good lecturers have their idiosyncrasies.  You can see his work clearly; he doesn't stand in front of what he is writing.  He erases problems quickly after he finishes, but you can use the ""pause"" function on the DVD player to take a longer look.

Jason doesn't solve any problems that require finding the unknown sides of a triangle using trigonometry on these DVDs  He doesn't cover the Law Of Sines or the Law Of Cosines.  He doesn't cover the trigonometric form of complex numbers.  When trigonometry or pre-calculus is taught in college, the course usually requires the use of a sophisticated calculator.  These DVDs have no examples of using one.  (Jason does have another DVD that covers the TI-84, which I have not yet watched.)

Accepting the limited scope of the material,  I rate this set of DVDs as four stars out of five to indicate that is an excellent set of marker board lectures on rote problems.  Understanding only these problems won't get you an A+.  However, if you don't know this material, you'll have a hard time passing.

Synopsis

( I use the customary notation ""x^p"" to mean ""x raised to the p power"".)

Disk 1

1) Complex Numbers  ( about 40 minutes )
He considers the equation x^2 = -25 and shows how it can be given a solution by defining
i = square roof of (-1).
Thet three types of numbers are: real, imaginary, complex.
He explains a graph of the complex plane.  (He doesn't make any further use of the graph.)
He explains how to add complex numbers.
Simplify (3 + 2 i) +  (-5 + 4i).
Simplify 7 - (3 - 7i).
He explains the multiplication of complex numbers.
Simplify ( 4 + 3i)(-1 + 2i).
Simplify -9i(4-8i).
Simplify 1/(3 + 2i).
Jason says ""Mathematicians don't like to have square roots in the denominator. Well,they don't like to have imaginary numbers in the denominator either.""  (That's a slander on mathematicians.  It's educators and graders who don't like this.  They want everyone in class to get the same answer and to perform a little extra work by modifying such fractions. )
He defines the complex conjugate.
Simplify (4 - 3i)/ (2 + 4i).
Solve x^2 - 3x + 10 = 0.  He applies the quadratic formula and obtains the complex roots.

2) Exponential Functions  (about 21 minutes)
The exponential function is f(x) = a^x.  He says the notation ""f(x) ="" just means ""y="".
He explains general form of the graph of f(x) = a^1 for the case a > 1 and the case 0 < a < 1.
He defines a^0 = 1 for ""any number 'a'"".
He does a ""qualitative"" graph for each of the following functions:
f(x) = 3^(-x).
f(x) = -2^x.  (He should have mentioned  that  (-2)^x  denotes a different function.)
f(x) = 2^(3-x).
f(x) = (2^3)(2^(-x)).
f(x) = e^ x.  He introduces the number 'e'.  ""e is just a very special number.""

3) Logarithmic Functions  ( about 30 minutes)
""The opposite of an exponential is a logarithm"".  (Jason never talks about ""inverse functions"", he likes the term ""opposite"", but doesn't define it rigorously.  He approaches this topic as a kind of ""cancellation"".  If you have  a^(log base a of w), the 'a' and the 'log to the base a'  will ""cancel"", leaving you with the 'w'.  )
He defines ""y = log to the base a of x"" to mean ""a^y = x"".
Find log to the base a of 100.
He lists the significant properties of logarithms without proving them.
If  a= e then  ""log to the base e"" is  written as ""ln""
""log"" = ""log base 10"".
Write the equation 4^3 = 64 as an equation that uses logarithms.
Write the equation 10^(-3) = 0.001 as an equation that uses logarithms.
Write ""log to the base 10 of 1000 = 3"" as an exponential equation.
Solve:  log to the base 3 of (x-4) = 2.
Solve : log to the base 5 of x^2 = -2.
Solve:  log to the base 6 of (2x-3) = log base to the base 6 of 12 -  log to the base 6 of 3.
Solve:  log to the base 10 of x^2 = log to the base 10 of x.  He explains why 0 is not a solution
Simplify: log to the base a of ( (x^2)(y)/ (z^3).
He graphs a logarithm function by asserting the fact that it is a reflection of the corresponding exponential graph about the line y = x, which he calls a ""45 degree line"".

4) Exponential and Log Equations (about 18 minutes)
Solve 10^x = 7.
Solve 3^(4 -x) = 5.
Solve 3^(x+4) = 2^(1-3x).  He takes natural logs of both sides.
Solve log x = 1 - log(x-3).  ( He eliminates x = -2 as a solution ""There is no such thing as the log of a negative number."")
Solve  log(5x + 1) = 2 + log(2x -3).

5) Angles  ( about 42 minutes )
The best Jason can do to define an angle is ""an angle is the measure of how much space there is between two lines"".  (I forgive him.  It's actually very hard to define an angle rigorously.  The usual approach in secondary education is to confuse a redundant system of parameterizing  angles with the angles themselves.  For example, 0 and 2 pi are ""coterminal angles"" (plural) but they are ""really the same angle"".  Jason uses this approach and students will survive such contradictions. )
He defines ""acute angles"" and ""obtuse angles"".
He shows negative and positive angles drawn about the origin of the xy plane.
He shows the angles 180 deg. angle, 270 deg., 360 deg.
He shows angles greater than 360 deg.
He explains that a 450 deg. angle""is really the same measurement as 90 deg"".
He introduces radians by declaring that  360 deg = 2 pi radians.
He shows angles of pi/2, pi, 3pi/2.
He draws special angles on an xy graph: 45 deg and multiples are  drawn in red, 30 deg and multiples
are drawn in green.
He repeats the drawing, using radians.
He motivates the attention to special angles by saying their trig functions have simple values.
Find two positive angles coinciding with a 120 deg angle.
Find two positive angles and two negative angles that coincide with a 120 deg angle  He introduces the terminology ""coterminal angles"".
Find two positive and two negative angles coterminal with a -30 deg angle.
Find two positive and one negative angle coterminal to an angle of (5 pi)/6.
Convert 150 degrees  to radians. He explains the cancellation of units when using a conversion factor.
Convert -60 degrees  to radians.
Convert 225 degrees  to radians.
Convert (2 pi)/3 radians to degrees.
Convert (11 pi)/6 radians to degrees.

Disk 2

6) Finding Trig Functions Using Triangles  (about 27 minutes)
He defines sine, cosine as tangent as ratios of sides in a right triangle.
He defines cotangent, secant and cosecant as reciprocals of the previous three functions.
He hints about the relation of sine,cosine and tangent to coordinates in the xy-plane.
Find all the trigonometric functions of the angle theta that is adjacent to a side of length 3 in a ""3,4,5 "" right triangle.
He mentions that  tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta).
Find all the trigonometric function of the angle theta that is opposite to a side of length 2 in a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 5.

7) Finding Trig Functions Using The Unit Circle (about 53 minutes)
He writes a table that shows the values of the sine,cosine and tangent of ""special angles"", pi/6, pi/4, pi/3.  He says to memorize the table.  (Jason doesn't derive these values.  The usual way to do that would be to analyze an equilateral triangle with an altitude drawn in it and a square with a diagonal drawn in it.)  He draws the unit circle in Cartesian coordinates.
He explains that the sine and cosine of an angle are coordinates of a point on the unit circle.
Find sin( (5 pi)/6 ).
Find cos( (5 pi)/6).
Find sin ( (2 pi)/3).
Find sin ( (4pi)/3).
Find cos ( (5pi)/6).
Find cos ( (7pi)/6).
Find sin(0).
Find sin ( pi/2).
Find cos (pi/2).
Find sin ( (3pi)/2).
Find cos ( (3pi)/2).
Find sin (pi).
Find cos(pi).
Find sin( -pi).
Find cos(-pi).
Find tan( (-5 pi)/4).
Find tan ( (-3 pi)/4).
He explains the notation ""sin^-1"".
Find  inverse sin(1/2) ).
Find  inverse sin ( (square root of 3)/2).
Find  inverse cos( (- square root of 2)/2).

8) Graphing Trig Functions (about 51 minutes)

He explains how to see how the sine and cosine of an angles change as the angle changes by visualizing this on a unit circle.
Graph y = sin(theta).
He defines the amplitude and period of the wave.
Graph y = cos(theta).
Graph y = 2 sin(theta).
Graph y = sin(2 theta). (He writes the problem as ""y = sin(2x)"".)
Graph y = sec(theta).
Graph y = csc(theta).
Graph y = tan(theta).

9) Trig Identities (about 39 minutes)

He writes the trigonometric identities cot = 1/tan, sec = 1/cos, csc = 1/sin.
He writes the identity sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = 1.
He explains the notation ""sin^2"".
He explains the identity using the unit circle and the Pythagorean theorm.
He writes the identity 1 + tan^2(theta) = sec^2(theta).
He writes the identity 1 + cot^2(theta) = csc^2(theta).
Verify the identity: cos(theta) sec(theta) = 1.
Verify the identity: sin(theta) sec(theta) = tan(theta).
Verify the identity: (1 + cos(theta))(1 - cos(theta)) = sin^2(theta).
Verify the identity:  sin(theta)/csc(theta) + cos(theta)/sec(theta) = 1.
Verify the identity: sec(theta) - cos(theta) = tan(theta) sin(theta).
Verify the identity (sec^2(theta) - 1)/ sec^2(theta) = sin^2(theta).
Verify the identity sec^2(theta) csc^(theta) = sec^2(theta) + csc^2(theta).
Verify the identity (cot(theta) -1)/(1 - tan(theta)) = cot(theta).
Verify the identity:  (sin(theta) + cos(theta))/(tan^2(theta) -1) = cos^2(theta)/ (sin(theta) - cos(theta)).
(Jason uses the careless approach to verifying identities that is traditional in secondary education.  For example, in one problem he multiplies both sides of ""the equation"" by cos(theta) without worrying about whether cos(theta) might be zero.  Coach Glonther wouldn't count this wrong.)",1282435200,7,10520,4.680653950953679
2399681,4,B000B51SRI,"Bought this DVD for my 9th and 10th grade sons, initially had to coax them to ""check it out"", after watching the first few minutes they agreed that it was a solid review of trig. The professor provides easy to follow instruction. This will be a great reference tool.",1271635200,,266,4.448979591836735
2399682,5,B000B51SRI,"I am a ""non traditional"" student in my 30s going back to school to obtain am electrical engineering degree.  I had been away from math for approximately 12 years before starting school last summer.  Because of that I had to basically start over with math (intermediate algebra in the summer, college algebra last semester, and currently in pre-calculus).  While looking for study aids to get ready for classes I came across this series of DVDs, and they are the best ""non required"" investment I have made.  I have the fractions through algebra tutor video all the way up to the calculus 1 and 2 tutor.  I will be purchasing the advanced calculus and physics DVDs as I need them.

I want to say a couple things about the videos overall, and then about this specific one.  The videos are meant to be a supplement to a textbook and class.  In none of the DVDs I have purchased so far has Jason covered every topic that was discussed in class.  He focuses on the foundation topics from which others build.  If you think you can just study the material on the DVDs then show up for quiz and test days and get an A in the class, you are greatly mistaken.  The best you could hope for with that plan is probably a C.  If you know the core/fundamental material well, which this will give you, you will be well prepared to tackle the more difficult concepts that will be presented in class.

As for this DVD in particular, it focuses almost exclusively on the trigonometry, and less so on the algebra.  The way most college level pre-calculus classes are set up, including the one I am in, is you do a review of algebra then get into the trig.  The only algebra presented in this DVD are exponential and logarithmic functions and complex numbers.  I am sure that Jason did not want to be too duplicative with the material on his algebra DVDs, which is probably why he focused more on the trigonometry.  I know one of the reviews for this DVD said something along the lines of ""this does not cover all the material in a pre-calc class."" That is most likely the reason why.

As I said in a review of one of the algebra DVDs, this is a no frills presentation.  It is a guy in front of a white board doing multiple problems.  It is not exciting or flashy.  Whether you are going to find this useful depends on your learning style.  If you can learn just watching a lecture style presentation, but one in which you cannot interact and ask questions of the instructor, these will be very useful.  If you are someone who learns more by asking questions and interacting and find the idea of watching someone do math problems on TV mind numbing, then you are not going to find this useful and would probably benefit more from a tutor.

*****Update*****

Now that I have finished my class I wanted to provide an update to this review.  As I said in the comment to one of the other reviews for this product, and somewhat above, there was no perfect way for Jason to make this DVD.  That has about as much to do with how many pre-calculus classes are structured as it is anything else.  If you use this along with his advanced algebra tutor set, you will get about 90% of all the material covered in most college level pre-calc classes.  You really have to look at those as one long DVD set.  Most of what is in the trig/pre-calc DVD will not be covered in college algebra, but a lot of what is covered in the advanced algebra DVD will be at least touched on in pre-calc.  That is not even to say everything in the trig/pre-calc DVD will be covered in every pre-calc class either.  In my class for example we did not spend any time on imaginary/complex numbers.

As for what is included in the trigonometry portion, Jason does go through all the fundamental concepts you need to learn to do well.  It is the stuff that if you do not understand it, you will be hopelessly lost when you get to the more advanced material.  The one change I would have made to the DVD is I would have included more of the trig identities like the double angle and half angle identities, and included a section on conics.  That said, the information he does give about manipulating the trig identities are the most used, and the most important ones to memorize.  Finally, you have to keep in mind this is a five hour DVD set.  There is no way to distill 10-15 weeks worth of information into five hours.  It is imperative to look at this as a supplemental tool, not a replacement for going to class and doing homework.  Anyone who looks at this as a replacement for those things will fail miserably and have no one to blame but themselves.

*****Update 2*****
Jason has released a second part to this set that fills in many of the gaps in what he did not cover here.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Trigonometry-Pre-Calculus-Tutor-Volume-2-6-Hour-Course/dp/B008GV690U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Trigonometry & Pre-Calculus Tutor - Volume 2 - 6 Hour Course!</a>&nbsp;It covers more of the trig identities like the half angle and double angle, even-odd, etc.  There is also a section on covering trig equations and a lot of material on the law of sines and cosines.  As I originally said in my review it covers the things that should have been in the original release with the exponential, logarithm and imaginary number stuff taken out.  Personally I think those subjects would have been better served to be on one of his algebra DVDs.  It had to be a judgment call though, and due to the fact that there is not a lot of uniformity between how and when trig is presented in a school's curriculum there was no perfect way to do it.  If you go to a school where trig is presented as a single class than this set will be better, especially when added with volume 2.  If however your school does a review of algebra then goes into trig then this will seem very lacking.  But, given that Jason had already put out two advanced algebra DVDs, it was not practical to put all that material on this one as well.  Nor should he have to apologize for referring people back to the other set if they need to brush up on algebra concepts.  In all, if you have this set, volume 2 of this set, and his algebra DVDs, the only thing you will be missing is the material on conics that you will hit at some point.  Those are really about using algebra to study circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas.  They are not something you will use trig for, so if your algebra skills are good you will be OK. Some pre calc classes also start introducing you to the concepts of vectors (to get you ready for physics), but Jason does cover those extensively in his physics tutor DVD set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Physics-Tutor-11-Hour-Course-2-DVD-Set-Learn-By-Examples/dp/B000FTJ2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Physics Tutor - 11 Hour Course! - 2 DVD Set! - Learn By Examples!</a>.",1264204800,30,6937,4.653530377668309

Unfortunately, I'm losing faith in this authors instructional experience/ability.

The author didn't do that in this case, and he relies too much on the audience having ""previous"" experience...

The author also seemingly becomes confused/distracted too easily by what he is doing, or is intending to do...

If you are completely unfamiliar with Trig or Pre-Calc then I suggest you not start with this DVD. If you have some past experience you may be able to ""muddle"" through along with the author...

Because as you know, most math books are written by brainy math folks, and they are not the easiest to follow.",1212192000,,544,4.093457943925234
2399691,5,B000B51SRI,"Great Product! If you are taking college level Math courses this product is a wonderfull resource. You still need to take the classes,but  add these to supplement your studies and improve your comprehension and grade. I love it because its straight forward; just the examples ,the walk thru to solution, and a few nuggets of insight. the subject matter is easy to referance and the moduals short enough to reveiw (which will become so valuable nearing finals)...Thanks for the help Jay",1207353600,,485,4.987654320987654
2399692,4,B000B51SRI,"The man has a very simple, memorable way of explaining things which is helpful. However, I didn't give the last star just because he looks like he's miserable. He could attempt to look like he's a little less miserable, although I've seen much worse.  I saw that people said my review wasn't helpful, so I decided to add a little more detail/explanation.  What I was trying to convey is that you may require your own enthusiasm to help you make it through these videos.  Would I still purchase the video?  Of course, because I sincerely need/want to learn this information.  In the earlier part of this paragraph, I was trying to warn that you may need to get yourself excited, because this teacher isn't going to help with his lack of enthusiasm.  I recommend the Great Courses ""Secrets of Mental Math"" video and associated book.  That professor is very enthusiastic and energetic.  I watch and get some degree of enthusiasm from his teaching methods.  Perhaps Professor Arthur Benjamin has a book or video on Trigonometry as well that may trump this one in enthusiasm.  Overall, I'd still purchase.  My review was hoping to forewarn others.",1201219200,,1142,4.805128205128205
2399693,2,B000B51SRI,"[Full Disclosure: I have some experience teaching math, physics, and technology at the high school level.  I have also taught film and video.]

I ordered this for my son who is in college.

Clearly this video series is a home made product, which is fine, but given what even an amateur can do on a Mac with iMovie and iDVD, the production values are, to be kind, non-existent.  Talking head ad nauseam.

Also, these videos are obviously ""lifted"" from within the series, with no attempt to make them a stand-alone product.  These is made evident by an opening line making reference to previous material.

I was disturbed to notice some ""reviews"" posted for some of the titles in this series which appeared as if they were placed by shills, if not by the producer himself.  This almost caused me to select something else.  Honesty counts.

Overall, the material covered is covered acceptably, provided you can stare at a white board and watch a talking head while remaining receptive to information.  For many students who are having trouble in the classroom, there is a need to support other learning modalities.  Unfortunately, this video simply replicates the traditional classroom experience, but without the option of asking questions.  And, as others have pointed out, these titles are not comprehensive.

One last complaint. When the package arrived, I was upset to discover that the discs were floating around loose in the case, and they had taken a beating equivalent to giving them to my dog for use as a chew toy.

I haven't ruled out ordering anything else in this series, but I am going to order something from a competitor for comparison before I return to this series.",1199836800,10,1681,4.849122807017544
2399694,2,B000B51SRI,"Id recommend this DVD for someone who has taken pre-cal and needs a little brush up on some basics.  I didn't find this DVD to be very in-depth at all, and not suited for what I was looking for.  I tried to use this DVD in conjuction with my class and it really didn't cut it.  I would recommend the Teaching Company's High School Algebra II for those about to take or who are taking pre-cal.",1197676800,10,392,4.131578947368421

The instructor is great pointing out every step in the solution.  I wish I had this crutch when I took Trig.  A great buy and sure to work specially if you, like myself, do not have a natural ability in mathematics.

One major caveat.  Significant aspects of pre-calc are not mentioned in this set.  So don't think that just by reviewing this set you will be ready for calculus.  Not by a long shot.

I am looking forward to getting into the ""Calculus Tutor"" set by the same instructor.",1179100800,13,735,4.299270072992701
2399698,3,B000B51SRI,"This is a VERY incomplete ""precalculus"" course that is essentially just a guy standing in front of a white board for five hours. The material is very basic, though it is taught fairly well. The target audience is high school students with basic algebra knowledge. As far as being sufficient prep for calculus? No way. Just take a look at any modern pre-calc text and then ask yourself if the material can even be scratched in five hours. Not even close. Also, the course has no written practice problems/answers for the student to use. A more accurate title for this course would be: ""Review of basic trig principles"". It also includes a basic intro to logs and exponentials, but that is about it....",1166054400,5,700,4.699186991869919

I buy items like this because I cannot tutor my kids in math because I can barely add. Based on the responses from my husband and teens, fast forwarding through this video set.
