8019651,5,B00020NL72,"I have been using Dalton's system for 16 years now.  I am a scratch golfer.  I will tell you that this swing is easier to understand than any other but it like all the other still requires practice.  One benefit to this swing is that after a few years and the muscle memory takes hold then it is pretty easy to take off sometime and still be able to stripe it.  You need to follow all of Dalton's steps exact though.  Also, you need to move the ball back in your stance just a little.  Maybe an inch or less.  The rollling of the LEFT HAND ONLY is the key.  You must learn to keep the right hand out of the swing if you are going to do this swing.  It will work but you have to put in the time.  I think this swing is easier to practice than any other.",1355961600,2,752,3.888157894736842
