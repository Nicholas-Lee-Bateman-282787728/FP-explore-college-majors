839293,5,6304312113,"In the movie ""In A Childs Name"" Valerie Bertinelli played the role of the sister who had a feeling that her sisters boyfriend was not who he was letting off to be and she knew something wasn't right but she didn't know what, She tryed to talk to her sister but she would never tell.  It wasn't till it was to late that they could do something about it and they had him investigated and thats when they found out what kind of monster he and his family really was after he was sentenced for his crime that his parents tried to take Andrew away from his family and was soon taken to court and fought for the custody of the baby and that was a long drawn out battle that they proceeded to try to trick another Judge into letting them adopt the baby by saying that his father was just off somewhere and that his mother died of natural causes and that plan fell through when the sister found out what was going on she put a stop to it and they got it where the father was not aloud to visit the child at all he was stripped of all parental rights and the grandparents was also stripped of all rights and the custody was ordered to the sister and he was legally adopted by the Cimarelli's.",1101254400,9,1182,4.139130434782609
839294,5,6304312113,"While this movie is incredibly long (was a three-part TV movie), it is brutally honest in showing the terminal flaws in our legal system. This film shows a sister (Valerie Bertanelli)seeking justice for her sister, and trying to follow her sister's wishes to raise her son rather than have him be a 'reward' to the man she knows murdered her sister in cold blood. Sadly, this film is so typical of our legal system! If you can stand the brutal honesty, it shows a great investigation and the doggedly stubborn Italian family doing what it does best; fighting for family. This film - by the way - did win an Emmy nomination; quite an honor for a film.",1082505600,17,650,4.516949152542373
839295,5,6304312113,"This is the movie based on Peter Maas' book - In a Child's Name. I viewed the movie after reading the book and what makes this movie exceptional is that it is one of the few movies which depicted an accurate version of the book. A few names were changed and the focus of the movie was on the victim's sister portrayed fabulously by Valerie Bertinelli. The movie is very effective in producing a lot of emotions in the viewer just as the book was. There is a lot to be learned from the movie - family love and support, the tragedy of domestic violence, communities pulling together for a good cause, the power of journalism in influencing court decisions, the judicial system ignoring what is in the best interests of a child, doing a thorough investigation of a person before jumping into marriage and finding out that they are a monster and finally - good does triumph over evil.",1049932800,12,880,4.50625

7867629,4,6304312113,This movie is from the classic television movie era that just isn't the same anymore. One of the most chilling scenes in this movie was when the husbands parents are asleep in the bedroom where the crime happened and when they turn out the light and the blood just glows. It's a dark tale about a woman killed by her husband and you will be entranced by the battle of the husband's parents trying to keep their grandchild. Valerie Bertanelli plays an excellent role as well as Louise Fletcher. I got this as VHS which several years later is still in decent quality.,1423267200,2,565,4.495145631067961

7867632,5,6304312113,"Great Movie, but not worth 90.00 on VHS. That's just plain greedy, it isn't even on a DVD version, and it does not matter that it is ""rare"". The movie cost more than what VHS  are worth. It would have to be in pristine condition, never ever used in a clam shell box to justify what the seller is asking. I'll contact my Canadian sellers because they would not cheat their customers knowing the age of the movie, that it was shown on television. Granted, a very good movie, the best and only decent work for Bertanelli, however, her supporting cast is what make this movie a winner as well. SO in all fairness, the movie is excellent, but the price is not right. It is better to shop around, too many of these sellers are either trying to score rent money or a dime bag party and this just does not justify what we already pay in shipping. It's just a greedy price for something that isn't on DVD with extras. Rare movies can be found for much less. I have found them, but was quite annoyed to observe such greediness. No one can justify that for a VHS in early 1990s. Sorry.",1388707200,3,1074,4.264705882352941
7867633,5,6304312113,"all the reviews on this wonderful TV movie are accurate and very detailed.  just want to add my two cents on how wonderful the entire cast is in this gem.  Valerie Bertinelli just shines as the tormented sister who feels guilt for not knowing/seeing the abuse of her murdered sister. Christopher Meloni is so good as her supportive, loving spouse.  it's nice to be reminded what a good actor he was before he began playing the bullying, smug, jerk that's he's perfected into a career now.  the movie is sad, moving, terrifying in it's reality, and stays in one's memory for a long time.  but what really makes it stick is the wonderful acting.",1317254400,,643,4.605263157894737
