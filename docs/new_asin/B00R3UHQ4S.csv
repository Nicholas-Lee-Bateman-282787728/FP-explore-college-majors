6898567,3,B00R3UHQ4S,Very fun movie about teenagers doing a sort of normal bad thing and spinning out into a super horrendous thing.  Very entertaining!  Comes off a little made for tv but it's a good movie with good acting.,1448496000,,203,4.45945945945946
6898568,5,B00R3UHQ4S,"Despite some moments where they say some stupid things, (I just can't get over Jordan saying his name was transgender when he meant unisex) it was a good movie, relatively suspenseful and the acting is good for Lifetime.",1445558400,,220,4.815789473684211

8693988,5,B00R3UHQ4S,"Laura Slade Wiggins portrays a mousey, ""bookworm"" student named Meredith.  She is apt to mind her own business, but her classmates become envious of her when she aces her college entrance exam.  She is offered a bribe to take the test for a former friend.  Ethically, she is opposed to the idea, but she obliges in order to use the $$ to help with the medical expenses of her disabled brother.

Soon after, a wealthy character straight out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mean-Girls-2004/dp/B00AEFYM2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mean Girls (2004)</a>&nbsp;tries to blackmail Meredith into taking the exam for her as well.  From there, things spiral out of control quickly.

This is a prescient film about bullying, especially when we have a bully in the Whitehouse who will say whatever number of lies he feels he needs to in order to push his agenda.  There has been an uptick in bullying since the last election, what has been referred to as the ""Trump effect""  This film brings to light the fact that there are real-world consequences for abandoning our ethical standards.  As Thomas Jefferson has said, ""Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.""

Cynthia Gibb portrays the mother of one of the students involved in the scam and it was good to see her again.

8693996,5,B00R3UHQ4S,"This was very good for a lifetime movie.  Most lifetime movies I am able to poke holes in all over the place, because they don't portray things realistically.  When police are in a lifetime movie or there are court scenes or hospital procedures or social service procedures, lifetime presents such scenes so unrealistically I get disgusted.  In this one, the police procedure was a little loose, but It was an excellent movie otherwise.  I was caught up in the characters ( well portrayed for the most part) and truly empathized with them.  This movie kept me engaged through out it.",1448668800,,583,4.79
