Follows the migration of the Edmontosaur and Pachyrhinosaur herds, while also keeping tabs on the Troodons, Gorgosaurus and Edmonton that stayed behind through the winter. Excellently done with insightful narration, commentary and valuable information.",1416096000,,366,6.196078431372549
8492496,4,B0064EGQ8G,"With The Great Dinosaur Escape, NatGeo makes a bid to join the BBC and Discovery dinosaur documentaries, covering Arctic North America.

In it, we follow two very different dinosaurs through winter.  Patch, a young Troodon, joins others of his kind buckling down for the season and contending with the local Gorgosaurus and Ankylosaurus.  The young Edmontosaurus Scar, on the other hand, faces a migration south - running a gauntlet of Albertosaurs on land and even worse things in a forced crossing of a tributary of the Western Interior Seaway, developing a sometimes ambiguous relationship with the Pachyrhinosaurs migrating along with his clan, and worst of all trying to muddle through the geological upheaval of the birth of the Rocky Mountains.

Doesn't sound like much of an escape, does it?

The Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurs are quite scary, and this is to my knowledge the first of these kind of documentaries to address the fact that evidence of cancer has been found in dinosaurs.  There are a few commentary breaks with paleontologists, but they felt less intrusive to me than those in the Discovery documentaries.

The Walking With series has no fear of being dethroned, but these are two hours that won't be out of place next to When Dinosaurs Roamed America and Dinosaur Planet on your shelf.",1327276800,6,1308,5.027777777777778
