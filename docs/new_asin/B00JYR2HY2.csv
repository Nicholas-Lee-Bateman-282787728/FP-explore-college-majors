6397237,4,B00JYR2HY2,"Great sci-fi fun which stands on its own, but it also lampoons other movies.  Plenty of fan reviews elsewhere, so I move on to a disk issue.  When the blu-ray arrived, I saw that it was ""Region B"".  Turns out it was produced in Region B, but its playback was unrestricted.  I happily learned that it would play here in ""Region A"" (which includes the U.S.) although part of the menu was dysfunctional.",1423094400,9,400,4.438356164383562
6397238,4,B00JYR2HY2,"Regarding the Australian ""Region B"" release:

The movie and special features play fine on my ""Region A"" equipment (nothing fancy, just a cheap Samsung player).

It's a great transfer with the exception of the 2 frames of pixelization that exist around  53:44. It's a ""blink and you'll miss"" it glitch but definitely noticeable if you're looking for it. This glitch is also present in the German release.",1422057600,6,403,4.985074626865671

The movie plays just fine in 1080p24 format on a US-market Sony Playstation 3.

The director's commentary audio track plays fine.

The video special features (alternate ending, outtakes, making of) do not play on the system above.  However, they do play just fine using Cyberlink's PowerDVD 10 software on a Windows PC.",1405382400,16,412,5.104477611940299

I listened to all the behind the scenes interviews and they kept stating that people couldn't really explain the movie or get into the movie. Why???? If they meant what genre to put it into, then that is the hard part, it doesn't fit into anyone one, it fits a few, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, drama, etc...it doesn't fit the mold which is why I loved it!!!",1473120000,,476,4.3

As a kid I loved the action and look forward to watching this and checking out any deleted scenes I missed. Plus the aliens and john Lithgow was very good at being the bad guy in this movie getting his first acting career taking off on the big screen. So check this movie out if your a major science geek fan why not!,1463270400,,510,4.0
6397255,1,B00JYR2HY2,"This review is for ""Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension."" released for region B by Umbrella Entertainment.

Blu-Ray disc - Even though the disc states that it is region B I took the recommendations from Amazon reviewers that said it would work on Disc players from the United States. They were correct. It worked with no problems. The transfer is about average for a 1980's movie.

Extra's - There are plenty of extra's including a commentary track by the director and writer. There is an alternate opening, a trailer and deleted scenes.

Plot/Summary - Banzai (Peter Weller) is a modern day renaissance man. He is a brain surgeon, rock star, race car driver, physicist etc. At the open of the movie is driving a vehicle that is supposed to go faster than the speed of sound. He drives it straight into the side of a mountain, or so it appears. He arrives on the other side unhurt where he discovers he has picked up some alien matter which is wedged under his vehicle. Apparenetly Banzai has gotten through to the 8th Dimension. Simple enough at this point. However from here on out I was lost and had to rely on getting a synopsis from the internet in order to understand what was going on.

We find out that there are two alien races here on earth battling over Planet 10 in the 8th Dimension....I think, I'm not so sure. Banzai and his band, the Hong Kong cavaliers have to assist the Black lectroids in defeating the red lectroids or they will start a nuclear war on earth. That is as much as I'm willing to write about the plot as it may not be correct.

THOUGHTS - This is the type of movie in which you either have to keep going back and repeating scenes or you have to watch multiple time in order to understand it (or do as I did and just read the synopsis on the internet!)

Quite frankly, I thought this movie was awful. I would have given it two stars for having lots of extra's but I can't in my right mind recommend it to anybody. It is almost pure camp. Even if you are a fan of camp this is not easy to follow. I know this movie has a cult following and a legion of fans but I'll have to agree do disagree with them.

Recommended for fans of the Batman movie with George Clooney.",1463011200,,2215,4.335748792270532
6397256,5,B00JYR2HY2,You need to be a Buckaroo Banzai fan for this to be what you hope for.  It is of the same vintage as Doc Savage.  Good fun.,1462838400,,123,3.5185185185185186
6397257,5,B00JYR2HY2,"Nice transfer of a great cult classic. I haven't taken notes on every detail of the presentation, but it's a fine looking 1080P transfer, does not seem overly processed (e.g. exhibits the comforting film grain as you'd expect of a movie from this era). If you like the movie, this would be a fine addition to your collection.",1462838400,,325,4.620689655172414

But I still bought it thinking there would be some space travel in it. (there's very little, just shots of alien ship near earth. The script is a mess, a totally incomprehensible story. Listening to John Lithgow(3rd Rock from the Sun - a show which I loved) go on a rambling speech about who knows what.  The acting is terrible. The only thing good about it was a rocket propelled truck going 500 mph. Ellen Barkin in a nothing role, but it helped her pay a few bills I guess.

6397272,2,B00JYR2HY2,"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend, and while he usually recommends some good stuff, I wish I would have passed on this one. There's something about this movie that ruins it for me, and I think it might be the attempts at humor. In reviews I had read where this movie is supposed to be funny, and my friend said the same thing. But I didn't laugh once. I struggled to watch the movie at times, as some of it was cringe worthy. I thought the movie was horribly written, directed, and acted.

I  know that their are some movies that you have to ""get"" to like, and from what I've read and been told this is one of those movies, and I didn't ""get"" it. I would honestly not recommend this movie to anyone, but, I do see why some people would like it as it is a very quirky, and unique, movie. I can not remember ever seeing a movie like this.",1446854400,3,850,4.083832335329341
