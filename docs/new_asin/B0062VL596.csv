4933923,3,B0062VL596,"La Fuerza del destino (The Force of Destiny - 756 minutes)

This telenovela is an average soaper with a sweet sister, an evil sister, and ""Who's Your Daddy"" all over the place. Little (illegitimate) Ivan (David Zapeda) has had a crush on the older sister ever since his mother became a maid at their house. He never noticed the sweet younger sister.

Time passes, the older one is out of control so her frantic parents send her away to a finishing school in the United States. When she comes back she is VERY worldly and sweeps Ivan off his feet. He's trying to become an engineer but when she turns up pregnant, he wants to marry her. Instead her family ships her off for an abortion.

Heartbroken, he becomes an illegal in the U.S., where he is adopted by a kindly wealthy Mexican man.

Biggest shocker is when the sweetheart's baby is tested and her DNA proves she is NOT the nice guy's daughter. The nice young mother is flabbergasted.

Lots of sub-plots but the bad guys are punished, the good guys survive and at long last we get our happy ending. See it from Amazon.",1372982400,,1073,4.454081632653061
4933924,4,B0062VL596,"Okay, my Spanish isn't perfect, but it's good enough that I watched this as it was airing. I then purchased this as soon as it was available. The editing on this isn't perfect, but it's good enough. As I was watching, I noticed there are some key scenes missing that make some of the plots hard to follow. On the other hand, most of the main plot isn't lost in the editing and thats a plus. I would personally still try to watch the whole novela if you can, but the editing on this one is good enough.

As far as the soap itself goes, I really enjoyed it. This was my first time watching Sandra Echeverria in anything and I thoroughly enjoyed her character. She was kind, but tough. I particularly enjoyed her relationship with her grandmaother (who did not play!). I'm a big fan of David Zepeda and I enjoyed his acting here. The chemistry between the main couple was great. I enjoyed all of the twists and turns and the side characters. I'd definitely recommend this one.",1372636800,3,973,4.405555555555556
4933925,5,B0062VL596,The actors are great and so is the plot of the story but they seemed to have rushed through the story.,1357084800,,102,3.9047619047619047
4933926,5,B0062VL596,"I saw bits and parts of this telenovela when it aired on tv, so I wasn't a stranger to the story. However, I was afraid that the editing would be so bad and I won't understand a thing like it happened with ""Fuego en la sangre"". Luckily that wasn't the case. The editing was more than good, it was almost perfect, although I wanted to see more of David's storyline, but in general the editing is great. A person who has no clue about the story will be able understand everything that's going on. Another great thing about this DVD set is that it has original soundtrack including main theme ""La fuerza del destino"" sung  by Sandra Echeverria and Marc Anthony. The original Entrada/Opening is also there.
Now as for the story itself. It' about  a man called Ivan, who after spending many years in the United States, returns to his home town in Mexico and seeks revenge for the death of his mother, and instead he falls in love. The lead couple Ivan and Lucia is played by David Zepeda and Sandra Echaverrie. They both have amazing chemistry! Then there's the evil Lucia's sister Maripaz played by Laisha Wilkins. Rosa Maria Bianchi is also great as Lucrecia, the estranged mother of Maripaz and Lucia. Although the cast member whose acting i enjoyed the most is Kika Edgar whose portrayal of the blind girl Carolina is incredible. She acts so believeable and emotional.
The show has all the factors that addictive telenovela: romance, betrayal, murder, revenge, handsome lead guy, crying protagonist, scheming villain, etc. So if you are a fan of telenovelas, go check this one out.
I recommend it!",1342828800,6,1596,4.696428571428571
4933927,5,B0062VL596,"Compre esta Novela para mi mama que le encantan y tiene 80 aos. Generalmente no me gustan porque las editan mal y se pierde el hilo de la trama. Sn embargo esta, a pesar de que no sabia nada de la novela, tengo que reconocer que esta muy bien editada y se entendio a la perfeccion. Quizas hay partes, para aquellos que la vieron en TV,sientan  que les falte algo, pero para mi estuvo excelente y la actuacin fue magnfica. Hace siglos que no veia una novela y cuando mi mama empez a ver el DVD me interes tanto que la tuve que ver.. La recomiendo sin reservas y espero la disfruten tanto como yo.",1334275200,12,595,4.173913043478261
4933928,5,B0062VL596,David Zepeda is a great actor. Rest of the characters too.  I have enjoyed immensely this telenovelas.  'Amores Cruzados' in which David Zepeda is a character was much more fun though.  Telenovelas in which diversity of nationalities are involved are really much more entertaining.  I would like to thank if possible to the author and screenplayers to these marvelous telenovelas.,1333756800,6,380,5.283333333333333
4933929,5,B0062VL596,"Son excelentes las actuaciones de David Zepeda,Pedro Armendariz, Juan Ferrara, Laisha Wilkins y  parte del elenco.

6/1/2012: Me Regalaron el Dvd (Edicin Mxico, Regin 1 & 4) para Reyes, Me Lo Importaron de Mxico por lo que tube la Oportunidad de verlo 1 Mes Antes que Salga a la Venta En Estados Unidos. Fue un Logro Muy Importante Poder Conseguir este Dvd ya que En Mxico Se Promociono En Television por el Canal de Las Estrellas pero No Se Puso Oficialmente En Pre-Venta En Ninguna Tienda Online, Salio Sorpresivamente el 16 de Diciembre y Nadie Sabia Nada al Repecto, ni siquiera en la Pgina Oficial de la Produccin de Rosy Ocampo En Facebook, y Hasta El Momento Solo Esta Disponible En Una Sola Tienda de Mxico.
El Dvd Es Exelente, Contiene un Muy Buen Resumen con Lo Ms Importante de la Historia, estan casi todas las Escenas que queria que tubiera. Me Encanto!!!
Tiene una Duracin de 12 Horas y 35 Minutos, la verdad Lo Recomiendo Abiertamente, Comprenlo!!! No Se Van a Arrepentir!!!
Lo Unico que No Me Gusto Fue que No Incluye Ningun Material Extra, Ni Fotos, Ni el Videoclip de la Cancion, Ni Detras de Camaras, Ni el Trailer Oficial de la Novela, Ni Promos ni Nada de Eso. Podrian haber Puesto algun Extra ya que Fue la Mejor Telenovela de Televisa En el 2011 y La Ms Esperada Por Todos. Ademas En La Fea Mas Bella y Las Tontas No Van al Cielo Rosy Ocampo Incluyo Material Adicional a sus Dvds. Este Dvd Solo Trae la Telenovela.",1320624000,14,2016,4.4959128065395095
