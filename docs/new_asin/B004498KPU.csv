4260462,5,B004498KPU,GREAT!! Nice to have all his short films in one place to watch over and over again.  This is a great gift or for those of us who feel we lost The Best Iconic Entertainer we'll ever see in our lives.  Fabulous!!,1290038400,3,210,3.9761904761904763
4260463,4,B004498KPU,"I emailed SONY to ask if there would be a Blu-Ray release of ""Michael Jackson's Vision"".  Their answer was that they only had info on products on their web site and thanked me for my interest.  In other words... no answer.

I already own everything (except ""One More Chance"") on DVD so won't be buying this unless a 1080p version with uncompressed HD audio is released.

I'm very surprised a Blu-Ray option isn't being released day and date (as this is SONY after all), but I sure do hope a Blu-Ray edition is coming soon as that would be an absolute must own release!",1289779200,7,568,4.4326923076923075

The younger generation now needs to experience the magic that was Michael Jackson. It's a shame they missed out on the MJ experience...the greatest entertainer/artist to ever live...and who will ever live. We were so lucky to have him the short time we did. Thank god we'll always have his music, voice, video, live stage performances and dance masterpieces.",1289433600,11,467,5.0

4260468,4,B004498KPU,"Hard to absolutely believe it has been almost a year and a half since the world received the devistating news that The King Of Pop, Michael Jackson had died. That June 25, 2009 hit everyone like a massive sledgehammer pounding the nails of life away. He tried to make his way back into the music industry, after years of heartbreaking moments of his life, from being accused of being a child molestor (which he was later acquitted from in 2005,) to battling bouts of racism with his label, after the way he felt not being promoted as a artist from the lackluster 2001 Invincible. He had lost his ways, and it wasn't until his death hit, that people were reminded of why Michael Jackson was definitive not just as a artist, but through the ways he pushed the envelope in his music videos. But, there hasn't been a definitive reflection of Michael Jackson's music videos, but this is a great start.

Michael Jackson's Vision, the first project Michael Jackson's estate released after singing a $250 million deal, is a DVD reflection of Michael's greatest music videos, past and present from the beginnings with Off The Wall, all the way to Invincible. The DVD includes Michael's biggest music videos from the definitive Thriller, to the way he strutted his walk in Billie Jean, to being a part of the most expensive music video ever with the $7 million video Scream with his sister Janet Jackson. Every definitive reason why the world still loves Michael is here. There are a few delights that also are strongly here including Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, and the never-before issued One More Chance from his 2003 Number Ones hits collection. The collection is very strong, but there could've been a few more videos that could've been a part of the reflection down Michael's memory lane, like the videos for Butterflies from Invincible, and the video for what was suppose to be his 2001 charity anthem What More Can I Give? to help the victims of 9/11, which neither were released to the public due to the strifes he had to deal with through his label, and the posthumous This Is It which Spike Lee directed the music video for, as a strong remembering of why the world loved Michael Jackson from the This Is It documentary.

All in all, Michael Jackson's Vision is a great buy for die hard fans of The King Of Pop. If you've ever wondered why he was strong into his music videos, than you'll see it so strongly through this DVD anthology of Michael Jackson's biggest music videos. It is a great buy for anyone whom not just misses Michael Jackson, but anyone that has never seen a simple music video from Michael Jackson's library at all. He really showed all of his life why his music was a delight, and his videos were more of a treat through Michael's vision. I absolutely recommend this as a great buy.

4260469,5,B004498KPU,"I'd like to order this in Canada, but Canadian Amazon still does it not have this amazing box set even listed for order! Amazon UK has disabled its site for MICHAEL JACKSON'S VISION box set pre-orders.  What seems to be the problem?  Very odd developments....

Regardless of what Oprah says or does, she won't change the minds of people who think Michael is ""guilty"" - they are stubborn mules.
Eventually these old mules will die off, and the future generations will discover the genius of Michael Jackson - they won't give a tinkers damn about some ancient allegations 40 years before!
Take Charlie Chaplin for example. Chaplin faced all kinds of controversies and scandals in his life, but is this remembered today?
The straight answer is ""no"", Charlie Chaplin is remembered as a comedic genius...
History will be far kinder to Michael than his contemporaries were... and his artistic genius will be his gift to humanity which will grow in strength in the coming decades...
So relax, Michael's legacy will continue to thrive.... What Oprah thinks or does will not even be a ripple in a pond in the eyes of time...",1287273600,15,1115,4.796875
4260470,5,B004498KPU,"No one can dispute Michael Jackson's dominance over pop music and his far reaching influence; music, dance, fashion, video, humanitarianism, generosity -- he was at the forefront of it all and remains unmatched.  Like any true legend, even in death, MJ continues to be a force of creativity and inspiration to millions.  And now, finally, his revolutionary short films are available for all to own and enjoy on DVD, and I for one, am thrilled!

I've been looking forward to this DVD box set ever since Michael died.  It doesn't take a genius or clairvoyant to know we're in store for many wonderful projects to come, headlining the King of Pop.  Some call this opportunistic; bleeding MJ fans for money.  But I don't see it that way -- the estates and legacies of Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, etc. continue to live on with various merchandising deals, and so too, will MJ.  He has MORE than earned his place in history, and I for one, look forward to all that's yet to come.  In the meantime, I scoured the internet for rare gems like ""Ghosts"" and the controversial prison version of the video ""They Don't Care About Us.""  But the quality of the unofficial footage out there is pretty terrible, so I'm really excited to finally own all these great masterpieces, fully restored and re-mastered to look and sound better than ever before!  With over 40 videos totaling 4.5 hours of wall to wall MJ, and 10 previously unreleased short films, this is the one and only, truly definitive MJ collection on DVD to date.

I only hope that someday, they also release this on a USB flash drive, like they did for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THIS-IS-IT-USB/dp/B00332GA8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THIS IS IT (USB)</a>.  I have that one on both Blu-Ray and USB (which I transferred to my hard drive) and I really enjoy having the video file on my computer for fast and easy access.  If I want to sit and watch the whole movie, I pop in the Blu-Ray; if I just want to watch a particular moment or song on impulse, then I simply click on the video file on my computer and instantly go to the song I want.  It's really awesome to be able to do that, so I hope they release something similar for Michael Jackson's Vision on USB.  I would love to have the same instant access to all MJ's videos just sitting there on my computer hard drive!  Who needs DVDs; they're so yesterday!  But they are ideal for archiving, which is exactly what makes this DVD so special.  I consider owning this treasured collection to be the same as possessing personal mementos and photos of my own life; both are part of my past and conjure fond memories, yet remain as real and alive today as when I first experienced them.

Speaking of archives, it's worth mentioning that Michael's ""Thriller"" short film is the one and only music video to ever be inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress; an honor bestowed on only a handful of films to date, and MJ is the only musician to receive such an honor.

Along with all the great videos, both classic and unreleased, this box set comes with a 60 page glossy collector's book featuring the King of Pop; adding yet another treasure to enjoy along with the DVDs themselves.  This is truly, a one of a kind box set that any fan will be proud to own.  And it's a fitting tribute to such a rare and special man.

That's quite a collection of short films!  The only one really missing is Disney's Captain EO!  Which BTW, had the help of none other than George Lucas.  No other artist in history has worked with so many top A-List people in their videos.  Only Michael could reach such a wide spectrum, break down all barriers and make something like that happen.  The man remains a rare and special anomaly.  Bravo Michael!

Bottom Line -- if you're a fan of Michael Jackson, then you can't go wrong with this beautiful DVD box set.  And it's even reasonably priced, considering who it is and all that's on here!  I know this is something I'll treasure forever.  The words ""special"" and ""genius"" are bandied about far too freely, but in this instance, the man truly lives up to the meaning of those words, and then some!  Thank you Michael, for all you have given, and continue to give us all.

MJ Forever!",1287100800,346,8056,4.636492220650637

In my younger years, I was a dancer. Thus, for me, there is no modern male performance artist who has ever danced more originally or well. Even Fred Astaire called Michael Jackson the greatest of all dancers. I would add ""male."" The song writing and singing done for the videos are beyond what words can convey. Only viewing the videos themselves can explain that the artistic performances of Michael Jackson are in a class above and beyond the scope and range of all others.

It was missing ""One More Chance"" ""We Are the World"" ""What More Can I give"" ""Hold My Hand"" ""Hollywood Tonight"" and the version of ""Blood on the Dance Floor"" was the slow version...(?) The ""Refugee Camp Mix"" is by far the best version of that song.
I was also bit let down by the fact that ""Ghost"" was a shorted version. The full-version of Ghost is amazing!
But what is really missing from this is behind the scenes and bonus footage. Michael Jackson was known for his behind the scenes footage and showing the ""Magic"" behind his short films. Would be nice if this included just a bit of that, maybe not for every video, but for more popular ones, such as Thriller, Ghost, Scream, Smooth Criminal, just to name a few.
Otherwise, the quality of the short films and the short films themselves are wonderful.",1441152000,,1055,4.415384615384616

I would only watch Disc 1 with the first set of videos with Michael Jackson singing and performing, because I already have another DVD with some of the videos with Michael Jackson from this DVD set. And some of the newer videos with Michael Jackson singing on Disc 2 is what I don't like, and the video with Michael Jackson singing, ""You Are Not Alone,"" is one of them. So, l would do without the videos with Michael Jackson singing on Disc 2 from this DVD set, and just stick with watching Disc 1. And I really like the look that Michael in his first set of videos from 1979 to 1982, and l would also like to know remember the Michael Jackson from that era and before the Bad era.

4260593,1,B004498KPU,"I'm a rabid MJ fan but this collection made me furious! Do not believe the product hype! Quite simply ""Michael Jackson's Vision"" promises a lot and delivers very little. There is no mention of the fact that almost all the videos are presented in 4:3 aspect ration, so if you have a television that was manufactured ten years ago, you won't have a problem. In addition, the claim that these short films have been remastered is a gross deception. As you'll see from other reviews, there are few videos that are actually in HD.

I already own various DVD releases of MJs short films including the Dangerous short film collection, the two volumes of his HIStory DVDs, Moonwalker, and his Number One compilation. I even own one of the few good versions of ""The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller"" on VHS, so when I complain about this box set, it's because there's so much to get upset about (one reviewer describes Michael Jackson's Vision as a disrespect to the memory of the artist and I couldn't agree more).

One of the reasons I bought this collection is because it boasts the inclusion of the ""rarely seen 'Ghosts' directed by Stan Winston"". I own the only officially released version of this amazing short film when it came out on VHS back in the '90s. There have been illegal transfers of the 38 minute film from VHS to Video CD that are pretty low quality (like a schmuck I bought one) but currently there are no other legal version formats available. Thus my excitement to read in the product description that the short film had finally made its way to DVD - and remastered no less!! Don't you believe it.

Instead of the 38 minute short film, what we are given is a 5 minute montage accompanying  the song ""Ghosts"" from MJ's ""Blood on the Dance Floor"" EP. Someone has actually gone to the trouble of butchering and reducing the original 38 minute remarkable short film down to a meaningless parade of nonsensical images. This ""limited release"" is nothing but a very expensive and poorly presented rip off. Even the booklet is lame and does not improve the quality of the product - merely a photo book of stills from the short films with scant production info. If I sound furious, it's because I really am. It's difficult to believe this was released by Epic because it smacks of the worst sort of opportunistic piracy - that is how poor the quality is! My advice: save your pennies and wait for an actual official release.",1391040000,5,2431,4.607390300230947

Buy this collection for most of Michael Jackson's videos. It isn't truly complete but it is the biggest collection on video. Essentially the big losses are the cut versions of Ghosts and Moonwalker (uncut versions are sold separately). Some have disputed the quality of the remastering but this remains a good collection until a Blu-Ray release. None of MJ's previous video releases were this packed with content.

Limitations:
We only get a 4-minute edit of Ghosts.
We don't get the entire Moonwalker for Smooth Criminal.
One of only two shorts for Who Is it? is included.
Captain EO, Human Nature, Ben, We Are the World and Heal the World (Super Bowl Version) are missing.
We get the remix of Blood On The Dance Floor instead of the original.
The Black or White short has been revised.

Buy: Michael Jackson's Video Greatest Hits: HIStory Volume I - Original Black or White short.

4260638,3,B004498KPU,"This is a pretty great collection, the case, booklet, and bonus disk are all awesome;
However, I definitely have some complaints. I was really looking forward to owning this set because I'm a huge MJ fan, and it claimed to be the definitive video collection. It was not.
I was very disappointed that it did not include the complete ""Ghosts"" short film, (which also included a dance number for the song '2 Bad' ) instead they slapped together the song with various clips from the movie, and called it a music video.
I was also disappointed that it did not include the whole ""Moonwalker"" film for ""Smooth Criminal"".
What downright upset me though was the ""Black Or White"" video. It included the extended ""panther"" version, which was good, but for some reason, they edited out the most important thing about that video. When it was originally released, it was considered controversial because of the racist graffiti on the windows that Michael detests, and smashes in a fit of rage. But, they edited out the graffiti, so Michael just looks like a jerk smashing up some random person's car for no reason. They included the extended version, but negated the whole point of it. On the plus side, it did have the complete versions of all the rest, including ""You Rock My World"" which I was happy about, as well as both versions of ""They Don't Really Care About Us,"" a big plus. To truly make your MJ video collection complete, I also recommend owning History Vol. 1 + 2, Moonwalker, and Ghosts separately as well, because sadly, I think this is as complete as it's ever gonna get. That being said, I definitely recommend this set for any MJ fan.",1356739200,,1638,4.651724137931034

4260650,5,B004498KPU,"This DVD package covers Michael Jackson's entire solo career with Epic Records from 1978/79 to 2003 with the music video for ""One More Chance"".

Sadly enough, Mr. Jackson's personal life seems to over shadow his musicial career. But, we must always remember, it was the music and the creative genius that made the world first love Michael Jackson.

All of these videos look great and have even been remastered for better video and audio quality. Bear in mind, most of these were filmed on video tape (480p/480i) so really they look the best that the possibly can here. Therefore, I'm not sure why people are complaining about the video and audio quality. The bottom line is that this is the best package of Michael's short films to date. Unless this set is released on blu ray (which it eventually will) this is the best that we have now.

The highlights for most are obvious - Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Thriller, Bad, Remember the Time, Black Or White, Beat It and You Rock My World. My favorites though were ""One More Chance"", ""Can You Feel It"", ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" (Prison Version) and ""Why"" by Michael Jackson and 3T.

Don't hesitate to buy this set. It is absolutely brilliant, and if you are a Michael Jackson fan, you won't be disappointed.",1328486400,2,1267,4.642857142857143

Another reason:  the publicized release of ""One More Chance"".

""Another Part of Me"" (by Sony) is fun to watch.  I recall seeing this on T.V.

""They Don't Care About Us"" is interesting. (Shot in a real prison environment?)

""Bad"" is good.  MJ could have made more movies based on his character Daryl-Home Boy.
Maybe about transforming those thugs he called friends.
I wonder how the guys who killed the real Daryl feel watching MJ doing their story?

Only having just gotten into Michael Jackson's music a little while ago, I can't call myself an all-the-way fan (even though most of his stuff came out before I was born). Still, for someone who wants to watch his films without reading terrible comments on YouTube, this was worth my money. I was really happy with the extended version of ""Bad."" I really only knew the songs on the first disc, but since this purchase I bought three more albums that had those songs. I can't stop listening!

For starters, They Don't Care About Us (Prison Version) is hard hitting and just plain brilliant. Next, Speed Demon was really fun and entertaining to watch.  So cool to see Michael's creative imagination in overdrive here.

I was also pleasantly suprised to find Say Say Say included.  I have always loved this song. A way cooler duet with Paul McCartney than The Girl Is Mine in my opinion. You can tell they had a really great time making that video.

Finally, I thought including the video for 3T's Why was a nice touch. So nice to see Michael so happy, smiling and singing with his handsome nephews.

My only regret is that he never got to create videos for any of his songs from the Invincible album. With the exception of You rock my
world. Butterflies, Unbreakable, Threatened, Break of Dawn, and 2000 Watts had so much video potential in my opinion. What a shame.

This video collection is a MUST HAVE for any diehard Michael Jackson fan period!",1316044800,,1154,4.590243902439024
4260658,4,B004498KPU,"Let's face it. Michael was one weird guy (hanging his infant over the hotel railing as an example). However, there is no denying that he was definitely the king when it came to music and dancing, and this DVD set showcases all of his talents!

This set has both pros and cons as far as I can see. More pros than cons though. I'll start with the cons:

CONS:
GHOSTS, as others have pointed out, this is not the full version.
Most videos are NOT in widescreen format, which means those of you with ""wide"" TVs will have black bars on the left and right sides of the image for most songs.
There is NO option to play a 5.1 or DTS soundtrack. So no 5 channel sound on this one.
It's missing at least 2 of Michael's videos (even if they would have just included them on the ""bonus"" disc it would have been nice). Those songs are WE ARE THE WORLD and BEN.

PROS:
The picture is definitely sharper than the HISTORY DVD I previously purchased.
The sound (even though it's only 2 channel stereo) is crisp and even sounds better than the past DVDs released.
You get a lot of video for the money with this one. Not just one, but 3 DVDs (the first 2 are more than 2 hours in length each).

4260662,4,B004498KPU,"First, I gave this set 4 stars based on the set and what was included. I will mention what I feel should have been added but that had no bearing on why it got just 4 stars. First off, put aside Michael's personal/legal issues, this is about the music/performances only. First I actually got to see videos that I have never seen before (I didn't have cable back in the day, so usually when I was at a friend's house I would watch mtv/vh1 (or should I say the john mellencamp channel as vh1 loved him..which isn't bad since I love his music as well) So anytime I get to see anything new is great for me. (new to me is still new) the performances/videos are as great as I remember them and the audio sounds great. However, there are times I feel like I'm watching an old video countdown show or looking at a vhs copy. The set says remastered (and formatted for widescreen televisions, though when played through my pc on cyberlink power dvd, I had a hard time making it appear as widescreen, but it worked find on my console) The intro clips etc looked excellent, and consider how popular Michael was you figured someone would have worked harder and keeping this stuff in more pristine condition, unless it was, and this isn't sourced from first generation film. To be honest, I have not seen many of these videos that much (except on the history on film collections) so I have no clue what was left out, if anything was. The Bad video etc seems to be the full version. (as I've seen more than one version of that one) and of course the stuff that was edited for tv (as they would show some videos in between saturday movies, if they had extra time to kill) seems to be unedited here.

the things I would have loved to see though, would have been Captain EO (which I have seen online before, and it's a bit cheesy but a good cheesy) and I would have liked to see the full version of the Moonwalker video (which had more involved scenes for Smooth Criminal) I know that they include a lot of the videos from that release, but I wanted them in a single cohesive package...it could have been a bonus on the dvd. I own the deluxe version of Thriller that Includes the Motown performance where he showcased his Moonwalking ability. and would have loved to see  that here just to have it in the same package. Also I own the Ultimate collection (I love those collections, I also have one with Billy Joel, and I love how they include rarer songs/b-sides/alternate takes/soundtrack songs..so I can have everything) and it included the live in bucharest (hopefully I spelled that right)and again, it would have been great to have it here as well. Basically I would have loved to have all the main performances included and not just short films. Just so that I can have one complete collection.

This set is better than the History on film volumes (two) as far as I'm concerned, but one of those was a flip dvd. meaning you had to flip it to see the rest of the videos. So anything is a step up from that lol. Also, one other thing, about the packaging. I am ok for the mostpart that this is a flip open case (though those are hard to maintain in my opinion) but it does have a slip cover to help with that. However, I wish that the slip cover had a spine to it. cause it keeps sliding off the dvds and book. A minor gripe. But, I have a huge collection of dvds, and cds, so I just wish that they would take time to look at this stuff to see how functional it is in the real world. There was a third disc to this set, which I think they could have added the missing stuff to, even in bonus footage/form. But it was great to see Say Say Say again, that video came out right when I was still totally amazed with Michael's music...and I loved the snake oil salesman theme, where in the end you kind of find out why they do it. Eighies videos were over the top or even cheesy but not in a bad way. Very creative though. and Michaelw was at the forefront.

One last note, the prison version of They don't care about us, is included, directed by spike lee, and well I think it detracts from the song. By showing civil unrest and man's inhumanity against man (though I am not sure if they were saying it was ok for them to beat up on white women because of how black people were treated, as I am often confused by spike lee's politics, he does more harm than good, and well I think music is one of the things where it can bring everyone together.) But you got to see all the violence (real) and it seems to diminish the song, because when you hear michael's issues it really doesn't resonate alongside everything else going on in the video (it makes him seem more self-centered, that the song is intended to be) But why did the censor the audio? I understood why he used those words, such as ""jew me"" as in context it's not racist at all, just graphically illustrating a point. But, I still prefer the orginal version of this vidoe. I like the inclusiveness of it, also the mix of the song sounds great. As for the booklet it's beautiful, but I wouldn't mind having it give you a little insight into the making of the video. But the pictures are great, some behind the scenes pics. Very nice, I just love reading info about my favorite songs/albums/videos. These are minor things though. I do like how they incorporate most of the videos released before and they do look better than they used to, but I don't know if I'd call them remastered. Most look pretty good though. They did remove some of the dust/dirt as it's called but not as much as they could have. But, Overall I'm quite pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it.",1313020800,2,5621,4.315042573320719
4260663,5,B004498KPU,"Was very disappointed with previous greatest hits collections on DVD of Jackson's film clips such as Number Ones which never mentioned anywhere on the cover that their tracks were shorter edited versions of the clip you saw on MTV and other music TV shows when they first aired.  Whilst there are still a few big Jackson songs missing from this, especially if you're including the Jacskon Five era, the really big success wise songs and film clips are on here in all their glory.

There's a lot of great intros to the songs which are interesting to see.  Granted on repeated viewings you may skip (fast forward) through some of them such as Bad where Michael travels on a few trains from university to whichever slum suburb in New York his character lives in, but they are interesting to watch. Maybe they could have made the intro and where the song begins as separate tracks, which you wouldn't notice if watching but if you chose later to just want to have playing from when the music began you could have picked that option on the menu.  I liked how Smooth Criminal gives the extended version where Michael shoots a lot of people (although you can still get a longer one if you're including the whole Moonraker movie).  I like how this collection hasn't edited the clips to make them family friendly or avoid the backlash of the moral extremists, and that we still have the smashing up the car, turning into a panther realising quite a while after transformation back to human that his fly is down scene at the end of Black of White.

The collection is divided into three DVDs.  Granted you are probably going to spend most of your repeat watching time on the first one where, Thriller, Bad, Man in the Mirror, Smooth Criminal, Dirty Diana and the other first half of his career songs when he was at the top of his fame and talent.  It also includes the Leave Me Alone film clip where Jackson made fun of the tabloids as well as Liberian girl which, although not a good song is interesting to watch with others where you guess the celebrity when they were younger, as the premises of the video is that Jackson has brought along heaps of 80s TV and movie stars to the set where they did not know about the others and they are all wondering why they are there.  They are pretty much just making fun of themselves.  I wrongly assumed one guy was Lionel Richie, all their names are given at the end in I guess a thank you for participating inclusion, so it's a fun game to play.

The second DVD is the 90s onwards era, like me you may even be unfamiliar with some of these clips such as Ghost, an average song but interesting film clip where Michael rips of his skin and dances around a mansion as a skeleton in a milder less blood wise similar sort of thing to which Robbie Williams did in one of his own song's videos.  There's an interesting video with Chris Tucker for the Song You Rock My World where a lot of the lines from 80s songs such as Bad are used by Tucker and other characters in another dance fight type scenario where Jackson and Tucker are trying to get with a really sweaty woman in a skimpy black dress.

There's also a third (called Bonus) DVD with three Jacksons songs, Blame it one the Boogie, Enjoy Yourself and Can You Feel It.  I'd never even heard of a song called Say Say Say, but it's a very listenable to song with a good film clip where a young Paul and Linda McCartney, and Michael operate a snake oils men type scam/entertainment company called Mack and Jack.  The trio along with a muscleman con locals, visit an orphanage and do a magic/clown show sort of performance at a tavern with the police in pursuit. It's a lot of fun to watch and looks like it was to make as well.  A better film than on the second DVD for They Don't Care About Us (called Prison Version although there's only a few prison scenes) is also on this disc.  There's also a previously unreleased track called One More Chance but it's nothing special.",1306627200,2,3956,4.412087912087912

The weight of the box set give a impression of that this DVD set is expensive.

I brought this for Rs. 3,500.00 (about us$37.00).

One thing I was really dissapointed was that all the music videos plays with two black bars (left & right). Only 3 or 4 music videos plays with the full screen length. I am using a Panasonic 37"" widescreen LCD with a JVC 5.1 home theater system. I would say the sound quality has been improved alot comparing to previous music video DVDs released for Michale Jackson.

Overall I am happy with the DVD, but I would be much delighted if the videos were in 16:9 screen size to suite any TV, LCD or LED.

4260668,2,B004498KPU,"First things first, we all know Michael Jackson is a great musician and artist.  There's no denying that.

However this compilation is a disgrace. Yes the sound is great (at 24-bit Linear PCM I would sure hope so), but the quality of the VIDEO is atrocious! And with this being a compilation of MJ's music VIDEOS one would expect pristine quality from one of the world's greatest entertainers.

The fact that the quality of some of these music videos has been better on DVDs released 3-4 years prior (not to mention the option of 5.1 Surround Sound) is depressing. Not only that, but some of the videos are incomplete!

So all in all, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money on something that is obviously a quick cash-in, especially when there are far better options available (Number Ones, HIStory on Film I & II, Dangerous - The Short Films to name a few).

Wait for a Blu-Ray release or get the other titles mentioned. Until then, avoid this thing at all costs.",1301529600,,971,4.589595375722543

It's got all the great songs (including the REAL Smooth Criminal, not that MTV sped-up, edited crap) as well as some that have probably been forgotten (I LOVE Who is It the video and the song and feel it's one of the more under-rated MJ songs). It's nice to have all the videos in one place instead of having to buy each video set in order to complete the collection (for example, every DVD set before this one has Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean on it but only one has Dirty Diana).

My one and only complaint about this set is the 3-minute Ghosts. I want the whole 40-minute mini-movie not the edited down bit. Ghosts is one of the best MJ works and it's not available in any form (that I'm aware of) other than this 'music video'. PLEASE release the whole thing on DVD/Blue Ray.

If you don't own any DVDs of MJ videos, this is the (as yet) best collection. If you do own other DVDs, this is still worth getting.

4260672,4,B004498KPU,"Since I'm late catching up with all things of Michael Jackson, this collection of his work helps me to not have to buy many others packaged separately. Most of his work, but not all, is here and a great collection to have all in one place for a fan getting caught up collecting Michaels vids. This is not everything I know he has done more than this and I will probably purchase a few other items to make the collection more complete. I must say that I feel the 3rd DVD in this set is not necessary for me. I purchased Michael's work only and not the ""Jackson's"" or his Nephews work. I don't care for Say, Say with Paul McCartney and the last vid that is supposed to be new by Michael all you see is the back of him mostly. Which I guess was his intent but not enjoyable to me like the first and second DVD in the set.

I also see the 3rd DVD as a way for his family to get their hands on some of the money from this set. Why include the Jackson's & his nephews in Michael's exclusive collection as a solo artist except to get the ""family"" in there so they get a piece of the pie. To me Disc 3 is not necessary at all. I also don't like the ""prison"" version of ""They don't care about us"". Even though it has a statement saying before it is played it isn't meant to be offensive to any race, etc. well to me it was very offensive. So that is not my favorite version of this song at all. And this is the reason I rated it with a 4 instead of 5. I purchased ""Michael's"" solo work. Not the work of others.

I do love the first 2 Discs and I have little collected so far since I'm getting caught up with Michael's work. So I am very happy to have this to get my little collection started for now. He is a ""one of a kind"" performer who's talent was simply amazing. You just don't see talent like his come by very often. A person who was so very uniquely gifted. He was a Masterpiece for sure. He will be greatly missed and I wish I would have caught on sooner to the talent that was before me all those years I was very busy with life. Now I have time and now I'm catching up and so very sorry that now that I can see the amazing talent he had now that it's too late.

4260681,1,B004498KPU,"The main reason I wanted to add this product to my collection was because it was rumored to include MJ's ""GHOSTS"" - previously unreleased in any form here in the states.  While ""Thriller"" is certainly the deserving landmark piece of work it is, I believe GHOSTS is MJ's modern day masterpiece - the Thriller for the new century.  The make-up by Stan Winston studios, the costumes, dancing, Michael's acting, and killer music and singing - all combine to make this a feast for the eyes for nearly 40 minutes.  All I could previously get my grubby eyes on was a grainy NTSC version converted from PAL.

The fact that SONY would release an edited music video version of this short film is a travesty.  All I can assume is they plan to release this as a stand-alone some future Halloween and make a killing from it here in the U.S.  Whatever.  Then they shouldn't call this his complete short films. I'm not one of those who complains that every last performance like those on the Super Bowl should be here (as if they were his short films).  By that logic, every television performance he ever did would qualify.

However, too much of this set has been previously available on various dvds...and what they did to GHOSTS is unforgivable - plain and simple.  And it is this sole act that has earned this collection 1 star.

4260692,5,B004498KPU,"Happy! Surprise! is what I felt when I finally, finally decided to open and watch MJ's Vision.  I think this set is very nicely done and though it may not be comprehensive enough for some, it proves more than satisfactory.  I'd say that if you can't own anything else, but you've got this, then you're good because it provides you with the many facets of Michael Jackson.  I love that they threw in the bonus CD and we get to see pumped up, excited Mike in Blame It On The Boogie and the Enjoy Yourself piece is both classic and priceless!  Such a good job was done in putting this together.  I'm impressed with what all you get for the price.  How good of them to include She's Out Of My Life.  I like how MJ is just sitting on a stool, no bells and whistles, dressed in everyday clothing, singing that song so beautifully and what appears effortlessly, yet you see and feel his emotion.  That, too, is priceless.

Many of my favorite short films are the ones that every MJ fan adores, so I'll skip those, and tell you about one of my favorites that I don't consider a short.  That woud be the Blood On The Dance Floor video.  I think of this one as a true music video.  What I really like about this one is that it almost seems as if Michael is at a real club, and though he is telling a story with his song, he's rocking a french braid and eyelashes and managing to look androngynous and sexy masculine all at the same time, while working it out on the floor with Suzie in a very un-choreographed way. This video has been extended and I like that I get to see Mike dancing in this natural form.
I want to add, that it also seems that the song was remixed; it didn't need that but like I said it extends the length of the video and therefore, Michael's dancing with a partner is also extended.

I won't go on and on, but you will if you get this.  The 3 discs provide tons of entertainment and I will be watching over and over again.  Of course, it's a great gift for any MJ fan, that really goes without saying, but the packaging is attractive and these discs are well worth more than $29.99.  And, yes, there will be more MJ stuff available in time, but this is what is happening right now.  Oh, and this far out matches Michael Jackson Number Ones.",1294444800,,2253,4.202325581395349

The only thing I'm not to fond of is how the videos don't fit the entire screen lol. I was aittle bummed to find that out lol :( Other than that, very happy that I have this dvd to add to the collection! I recieved Michael's ""Vision"" as a gift for Christmas, so Xmas turned into a Michael Marathon for me lol. I wish the dvd had like behind the scenes of his videos and interviews with him. I've been waiting along time for more concert dvd's to be released from Michael's past tours, idk if that's ever going to happen tho :( Michael is the only person I think I'll ever give ""5 Stars"" for everything that he does lol. I'm that much of a huge fan lol. Michael has set the bar soo high for enterainers like me and that's why I love him soo much. He has been such a huge inspiration in my life since the age of 5 and he will continue to be an inspiration for me for the rest of my life!

It is on everyone's must have list.  Michael didn't have a chance for the big come back he was planning before his death but we have this amazing box set to allow us to remember the genius that was Michael Jackson. Watching this reminded me of so many great songs and performances that I had forgotten about. I cannot get Man In The Mirror out of my head.

With over 4 and a half hours of Michael Jackson, this is truly a fan's paradise. My kids have no idea who Michael Jackson was but they enjoyed the few videos I showed them. Including, Heal The World, Smooth Criminal, Say, Say, Say and Come Together. I heard my daughter singing Smooth Criminal in the car this morning. Cute!",1294185600,,826,4.35064935064935

It is some poor montage of the full version. If you never saw the original it would make no sense. Also, just like the MJ dance game, they used the LP version, not the video remix. #2 I have other MJ DVD's and many have poor editing quality and menus that don't work. The same on this set. The biggest pain being this is one of those DVD's that do not let you fast forward or rewind. You are forced to watch the video through completely. No skipping stuff you don't want to see, or rewinding your favorite part. I just wanted all MJ's videos, full and unedited, menus that work, good quality, and use of the simple RW and FF funtion.

4260701,3,B004498KPU,"i am one of the many, many mj fans. after he died and the estate signed that deal with Sony, i was all ready to purchase anything that came out. so far i was doing good, buying the mj opus, mj's moonwalk autobiography, (still debating the 'Michael' cd)), and this vision box set. i have both ""HIStory"" dvds, the ""dangerous short films"", and the ""number ones"" dvd. to be honest, i really didn't have to get this set, but obviously i ended up changing my mind. so as far as my actual review for this set: it's bittersweet. on one hand, i'm glad i have it, but on the other hand, i wish i hadn't gotten it. overall, the collection as a whole, is great. it is something very satisfying to see all of mj's videos in a set. although i think some of the videos that are on this set shouldn't've been on here.

like take ""speed demon"" and ""come together"" for example. these two should not have been on here. those two films are from ""moonwalker"" so that's where they should stay. it was a waste of 15 min of space, space that could've been used for ""captain eo"" or something. also, i think the ""smooth criminal"" video should've been the ""album version"" which was the blurred, sped-up video, and leave the long version of ""smooth criminal"" on ""moonwalker"". ""will u be there"" should've been the ""free willy"" footage version instead of the ""dangerous short films"" version. ""blood on the dance floor"" should've been the original and not the remix. the remix is on ""HIStory vol. 2 dvd"", so why put it on here? now a lot of people had a problem with ""ghosts"" in it being not the full-length version. me personally, if the estate/sony plan on releasing it on its own dvd, then the short version on this set is cool. and of course, as other people have mentioned, other videos could've been present like ""torture"" (mike wasn't in the video, but still...) ""2300 jackson st"", ""we are the world"", ""what more can i give"", the video with eddie murphy (can't remember the title), and the one video that would've closed out this entire box set perfectly; the ""this is it"" video.

now the quality could've been a better too. some of the vids look good while some look grainy and zoomed in too much (ex: ""remember the time""). there's also people talking about the whole woulda/coulda/shoulda been in 16:9 widescreen format. people say it can't be in widescreen because of this and that, it wasn't shot with widescreen cameras or some mess, which i find odd because there have been movies that were made in the 40s, 50s, etc. that have been restored and remastered on dvd and are in widescreen format, whereas jackson's videos were made in the late 70s, 80s, 90s, 00's, so if there was a way to widescreen them, then yeah, it should've been, but i don't know. i'm not bothered by the black bars on the sides of the screen. would've been cool though in widescreen. well, all i know is if i was in charge of this ""vision"", i would've did his videos justice and made the fans proud. put me in a technical room or however the hell they do it and leave me the hell alone. i would've done it to perfection. so... all in all, this is a good collection, but could've been better with a few minor changes of taken out some videos, putting in some videos and a little bit of better quality.

p.s. i forgot about the intros to each video. i like. :)",1293840000,,3312,4.417348608837971
4260702,4,B004498KPU,"Having never owned any previous MJ video releases, this was a set worth owning. I spent all day playing the first 2 DVD's of all the mini movies. I forgot how many he had, and was surprised by a few that I had never seen before.

I am not going to list all the videos, Amazon and several reviews have done that a lot better than what I could do here. I read people complaining about quality, and the definition of what ""remastering"" is. I am never surprised at what people complain about. I feel that being able to have all these videos in one place on 2 dvd's is awesome. The quality is excellent on my TV, and the upscaling my Blu-Ray player does, makes the images pop.

I had this one while my kids were watching (5 & 2) and I was trying to explain to the 5 yr old how important he is to music. He watched many of the videos without saying much, he did get scared of ""Thriller"" But just being able to play his entire visual body of work to my kids makes me happy.

I only give it 4 stars because it is incomplete - it does NOT contain all of his music videos. The two that are missing are ""Captain EO"" (my favorite of his videos, even above Thriller), and the ""We are the World"" video. I assume that has something to do with who's got the rights to those - Captain EO is Disney's domain, and We are the Worlds - not sure but it wasn't Michael Jackson alone who made it.

The other reason I give it 4 stars is that it does not have subtitles. Wouldn't that be cool, to be able to see the lyrics via subtitles? I love Michael, but sometimes his lyrics are hard to understand!

Even if you own previously released DVDs with MJ short films, this one is worth buying if only for the following gems:
- ""Once More Chance"", ""Say Say Say"" and prison version of ""They Don't Care About Us"";
- ORIGINAL version of the ""Black or White"" panther dance - as conceived by Michael, without Nazi graffiti, just pure symbolic dance;
- 16:9 format videos finally made real 16:9, instead of being trapped in a letterbox.

Unfortunately, this DVD-set does not include the full version of ""Ghosts"" film, but I'm hoping it will be released separately someday. Being one of Michael's most profound works, it's only available on VCD now. Seriously, how has that happened?!

4260730,5,B004498KPU,"I've read multiple complaints here about people being upset over not including certain videos, but here's my take on it.

Human Nature was not an official video, nor did he, his record label, studio, estate or anyone with connections to him whatsoever make, approve or consent to the video.  I won't go as far as say it was a ""fan video"", but it's in the same category.  I don't care if MTV or VH1 has shown it... they show a lot of things.  Therefore, while I think it's not only his best song on Thriller, but one of the best 3 songs he's ever recorded; I'm not in the least bit sad or upset that it wasn't included here.

Also, We are the World wasn't an official Michael Jackson video, it was a side project.  So I can understand why that's not included either.  If they were to include it, it should also be included in DVD sets of videos from every other artist in the video (yes, even Dan Aykroyd).

When it comes to Smooth Criminal, which is one of the to 3 songs I mentioned above, I love the version they included.  I think they wanted to include the most complete version that's considered an ""official"" video, and not that actual official video (plus, I HATE that the dance is sped up in the ""actual"" version, because I can't enjoy it).  But I'm also one that thinks the full second verse included in the Moonwalker is the best verse/part of the song, so I'm happy that it's there no matter what the rest of the video looks like (I'd even deal with the nasty blur effect as long as the full verse is there).  I had something else to say here but forgot what it was... I think my point is made though.

I'm a little upset that the full version of Ghosts isn't included, but I realize DVD's can only have a certain number of GB on it, and/or only be a certain length of time.  They probably got really close to that with the second DVD so I can completely understand why the 40 minute movie isn't on there.  However, there was room on the third disc for at least the 9 minute video version of the song with the intro and outro.  I mean, I know they wanted to do them in order, but Ghosts isn't exactly an ""official album track"" of his, is it?  It could and should have been on the 3rd disc if they wanted to do it right.  Including the full 18 minute movie version of Bad plus the 11 minute version of Black or White (with the banned 6-7 minute dancing outro) but not the full Ghosts is just unacceptable.  However, I don't really care for Ghosts anyway (the song is mediocre at best, and the video is a disappointment to everything he's ever done... it's so unlike him).

I don't really have any other complaints... everything is as it should be.  The boxy format doesn't bother me, because when his videos were shot they didn't have big screen or wide screen, so in order to blow them up to be formatted to fit our televisions, they'd have to sacrifice some quality.  And I know that's what remastering is for, but I'd rather see the videos in their original untouched format/quality (which I've learned is not how some of his early ones are in this set).

Overall, as a lifetime fan of Michael Jackson (for 22 years now) and never having owned any of his sets, except for albums (no DVD's, no concerts, tours, behind the scenes, collections, etc.), I have to say I'm very pleased, impressed and excited at this over-the-top collection that I can sit and watch together, as a whole, for the very first time.  Some videos (4 or 5 to be exact) I didn't even know existed... but some shouldn't have, and I can understand why I'd never seen them before (in the case of Speed Demon and Liberian Girl, for example).

So, all-in-all, this set amazes me, and I'm glad I bought it.  Because I now own one of the greatest, if not the greatest, collection of music videos ever filmed and compiled.  I just wish they would have waited a month and then included the Hold My Hand video.",1291766400,,3884,4.3227586206896556

Even more strange, no other fans on here are making a big deal out of it's absence either. Even though it is not anything spectacular or perhaps not an ""official"" video, I do remember seeing it on MTV many years ago (and it can be seen on Youtube) and had become accepted as the only music video made for the song. There is no reason why it could not have been included on disc 3 with the other bonus videos. Also, I was disappointed to learn that the full version of ""Ghosts"" is missing, as well as the normal version of ""Blood On The Dance Floor"", the montage of ""Dangerous"" and ""We Are The World"". Plus it would have been neat to see ""This Is It"" (the song). Otherwise, I was pleased to see my favorite, sinfully underrated song (""Give In To Me"") was actually on this set, along with all the others.

Both should be on here. In fact, I'd even go so far to say that ""Captain Eo"" should be on here as well.

The black box on the screen seems to be a big issue for many people, however, it does not bother me.  I am too engrossed in the VIDEO to worry about a black box that is not dominating the picture.  I like having the option of watching his videos repeatedly to study his creative movements/ideas, passion, and sense of direction in the form of art.

Watching ""One More Chance"" gets me teary eyed.  To know that this is the last video he worked on and never completed is heart breaking.  From what I see of his face in the video he looked so happy!  We all know what happened the next day after the shoot so I will not discuss it here because this is a review.

I'm also not going to sucker folks into buying something just because of the NAME. This set was made very sloppy, from GRAINY, DARK scenes, that I didn't recall in ""The You Make Me Feel"", to the annoying letter box, in every single video. I have 3 different videos of this song on DVD, not EVER did I see that grainy, horrible scene on those other DVDS. The other BIG problem are the LETTER BOXES. What the hell was the point to do that? Yes, the AUDIO is great, if I just cared about that, I would just BUY the ALBUMS, you get me?

 Let's not ""praise"" this set, as the FIRST reviewer did, BEFORE the set was even released. So I don't know why he has so much positive feedback, or people that ""agree"" with him. When clearly he didn't even WATCH the set before he posted his review. He just wrote the information down for each Music Video, what kind of REVIEW is that?? We want REAL CUSTOMER reviews, to tell us the truth about the products. It seems the First Reviewer might of worked for Sony, or just really doesn't  know the meaning of ""review"", and why so many people agreed, I don't know. I got suckered in by his review as well, thinking everything was fine, before I purchased the set last week. Don't be fooled MJ FANS!! Don't listen to the FIRST REVIEW, its not that GOOD AT ALL.

But if your comfortable with watching a ""TINY black bar screen box, inside a BIG black bar screen box"", then this set is JUST for you.

I just ordered BOTH History On Films 1 & 2, Dangerous (The Short Films), and Number One's.

This Box Set is only worth the unreleased videos, HONESTLY, thats it. Again, I really don't care about the ""sound"", thats what the MJ CD'S in my STEREO or COMPUTER are for. So if you're like me, and you expect the FULL experience of these classic films, in its FULL entirety, your NOT going  to get it by purchasing this box set.

4260745,3,B004498KPU,"When it comes to music videos one man who had a strong influence on them was Michael Jackson. There were considered promotional tools (and that's kind of what they are) but Michael changed the way the world looked at them and HIS videos are some of the most memorable ones. Who can forget a young MJ in the red jacket he wore for ""Thriller""? Possibly the most iconic music video there is. Or how about Michael dancing along criminals in ""Smooth Criminal""? And that lean? How about that Black or White video when... I think you get it by now; Michael's influence was not only felt on music itself but also on music videos. It's hard not to think of Michael without remembering one his classic short film. It's great that Michel Jackson's Vision, a DVD collection containing each music video (or short films as Michael liked to call them) made by the king of pop was released. The packaging itself is very nice (I love the 60+ pages booklet and the gold box looks very good) and the idea of having all of Michael's music videos in one place for the fans who want to own them on DVD (some are just fine with YouTube and don't feel the need to pay for this release) is a no-brainer.

Visions sounds like a great release and something that fans would be interested in owning, however, the video format is a big issue. Watching them, many of the videos have a black box surrounding them ruins the experience a little I have to say. I wish Sony would have done something about this because it ruins it for many fans and is unfair to them. I won't say more because other reviewers have done so here and gave good descriptions. I also don't quite understand why Visions is not available on Blue-Ray, to me it's not a big deal but I know there are plenty of fans who would have preferred/wanted this on BR (it's Sony who releases this but it's not available on BR?).

One of the most unfortunate thing is that the version of Ghost here is the 5 minutes edit and not the full version; it would have been nice to have it here in its entirety and it would've made sense since it's hard to get hold of (there will probably be a future release) and there was enough space. It would also have been best if the original ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" was included instead of the mediocre remix. On the other hand it's certainly nice to have the bonus disc with the prison edit of ""They Don't Care About Us"", the unreleased videos for ""One More Chance"", ""Say Say Say"" with Paul McCartney and more along some classic video with Michael's brothers (then known as ""The Jacksons""). Getting unreleased content is always a bonus and it's the case here as well, I think it's good to finally have some of this stuff released, yes there was room for more but this is strictly a collection of MJ's videos. Some of the videos look better than ever whereas others look as if you're watching as VHS tape, for instance ""Billie Jean"" and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"". Like other fans, I would have expected better quality from a DVD release but I'm glad to have them (and the video quality is still better than YouTube for me).

While it's great to have all of MJ's videos in one place the format issue is simply too big to be ignored : 3/5 stars.",1290902400,5,3208,4.361204013377926

He is found in our hearts for a reason and that is to LOVE and REJOICE in his work, and remember he has always loved us no matter who we are, or where we come from this I know to be true.

When you watch these videos you can see a master at work, his loyalty to the fans, his artistic creativity and moves that only he can do. He has inspired us, made us laugh and cry, awakened apart of ourselves to know ""we"" can make the difference by looking at the ""man in the mirror"" I am greatful that love was put into this DVD collection, it is remastered, and is high quality. There are clips I have never seen before, ""The way you make me feel"" extended, extended version, and 'Gone to soon"" I have over three hours of MJ videos at my finger tips, and yes the new one of ""one more chance"" This video shows a different side to MJ, in fact you verily see his face, but it still has a powerful message in it has do all of his videos.

For instance, ""bad"" tells a story of how hard it is to get out of a gang, for one boy wanting to get on with his life, but the gang pulls him back. ""Beat it"" also shows how gangs life tends to bring about hatred, bigotry, and prejudice all for the sake of territory, and beliefs. ""heal the world"" this tells the story of healing pure and simple and the importants of putting our swords down, and embrace each others as if we are ""One"". It doesn't matter if we are ""Black or White"" we are all from the human race.  And my favorite ""Will you be there"" a story how our faith helps keeps us strong through the many storms in our lives, who better to relate this message than MJ himself. Trials, and Tribulation will you be there..""Come together"" as much as I like the Beatles, Mj done this song his way and to me grabs your heart, and soul to watch a very sexy talented man bring together the gift of love. By honoring MJ is to honor his gifts, talents and message of hope, peace and joy..This collection is worth it in some ways it is a gentle reminder of who we are, and how MJ single handedly brought us all together to rejoice in his music and one another..Mend the wounds of hatred, bigotry and prejudice by uniting to one solid force..MJ soldiers of love...",1290902400,3,2407,4.095338983050848

I didn't experience the grainy effect that others have, but in the fact that most of the videos (especially disc 1) were encased in this thick black box which in turn causes the video to look very small. Michael was meant to be enjoyed in a large view, whether it was a short film or in concert live. Michael would not have cheated his fans if he was allowed to oversee this project and Sony basically ripped off the fans with this project. Now I am not so sure if I wlll get the album ""Michael"". The one song I did hear, which was ""Breaking News"" definitely sounded like someone else was singing the song with snippets of Michael in the back. Michael should never be in the back on his own song and if this is the case with one song, what about the other songs. There was a reason why they were unreleased in the first place. This video project with all of his short films in one set was a good idea but was poorly executed. The fans should have been surveyed beforehand on how they wanted the short films to look (clarity vs format). One would think that with today's technology they could have delivered on both fronts.

I expected a much better quality picture and sound coming from Sony. This is not remastered, in any way shape or form. It doesn't matter if you're viewing on wide-screen or a regular 4:3 ratio format, this is crap. Sony should be ashamed of themselves. This here, is the equivalent of those bootleg video's some guy sales out of the trunk of their car. The only thing missing is the audience sounds and the bouncing heads of people moving around in the theater.

I'm just really disappointed. In addition to the slightly jittery frame rate, the picture quality is poor and the video size is ridiculous. To add insult to injury, I can't play the set on my surround sound because there are no  sound options. This is a product of, pure corporate laziness. Sony where is your pride?

If this is what we loyal fans can expect from Sony's suits (a total disregard to quality assurance), then I will hold off buying anything else in advance from them.  I'm watching this, feeling totally PUNK'D...Anyone defending this is setting a precedent that says to SONY, ""just slap Michael Jackson's name on anything and I'll blindly buy it.",1290816000,30,1272,4.64
4260750,4,B004498KPU,"The top reviewer said it all best and others have talked about the aspect ratio, so I won't delve into that, even tho they are major complaints and do ruin the enjoyment. But I feel compelled to comment because as a long time Michael Jackson fan it was and has been extremely difficult to deal with his loss. He was a true work of art to the world and was never appreciated the way he should have been. People hated him for such horrid reasons--they hated the way he looked, he loved being child like, he loved kids because he never got to be one, he was black (yes, that is a reason) and he had incredible influence and power.

That said, Sony *cough* money mongrel murderers *cough* had a chance to really give their fans a true testament to the genius of Michael Jackson. This set is very pretty, I love the cover and such, but sadly you do feel a little bit of the disinterest that Sony has in giving us a real 'Vision' of his talent. Michael is gone now, so for them to come out and boast another box set we should get the most ultimate that we can get.

There is no excuse for 'Ghosts' being in its short form. None at all. Not only is that a very overlooked and mostly unknown piece of genius, it spoke a lot of what Michael was going through being mocked and humiliated, and now more than ever we need something in his OWN words. Even with the obvious undertones in the short film, That short film is brilliant, I only saw it once and it deserves to be seen again.

Somehow, some making of videos should have been included, where is the making of Thriller?! and I'm sure there is something on 'Scream' lurking around. Oh sorry, that's coming later to get more money.

Anyway, all versions of BOTDF should have been included as well. And the true cut of 'Black or White' should have been in there--with racial slurs and all. That was Michael's 'Vision' in the beginning and we all know the back lash he suffered from that fall out.

THINGS I'M GRATEFUL FOR:

I'm happy to see the prison version of They don't really care about us. That is a great video and it was pretty much banned and forgotten.

Love seeing 'Say, Say, Say' I know a lot don't care for it, but I love the song and Michael is a cutie in the video. It is hard to find elsewhere.

'Can you feel it' is another gem. I know some may think why pull this one song out of nowhere to be included, but it is another hard to find video with him and the brothers. Not to mention a really great song. Happy to have it.

""Who is it"" The vision of David Fincher still has us scratching our heads. I don't think people cared for the abstract expression this video left us with. Nor did they care for a Michael Jackson video where he half appeared and did no dancing whatsoever. This video is confusing, but Michael looks luscious and it is a rare one indeed.

Also, as someone mentioned, some video quality is not as good as others, yes, this refers to 'Billie Jean' and 'Don't stop till you get enough' Sad but true. I'm not 100% sure why, they couldn't transfer it properly, not sure, but it's not as sharp. Sound is great however.

While most already have #1s and the 'History' DVD's one might say 'why do I need to rebuy all his videos again?"" Well, you don't. Which is why this set is a hit and a miss. I have one History DVD and that gave me a handful of videos I have already. There are some goodies, which includes the lovely thick booklet with delightful photos to go along with every video including the names of the directors and production date which (for me anyway) I found useful.  This still does not make me feel like I am holding a 'lost treasure.' Even with 'One more Chance' which was hard for me to finish.

That video felt rushed and incomplete and it is just difficult for me to enjoy it, even if he does look happy.  Michael was well on his way to giving us so much more of himself and this is proof of that, he was working on new music and it was coming, so I'm sorry but I can't go into that video, it's hard for me to watch it more than once to give more of a review.

The biggest selling point is really just having all his videos together for safe keeping. I will say that--for now--this is a really good video collection for him and pretty much the only true one out there. If you want all his vids in a one stop and shop get this, it's not too pricey either. If you have all his vids spread out over other DVD's don't bother unless you really do just want them all in one place. I just can't say that the extras warrant you picking it up. Beautiful set but leaves a lot to be desired if you already have all of his videos already.

Overall, it makes me sad that Sony screwed him and his fans--AGAIN. But at the same time is wonderfully packaged and pretty to look at. Very convenient to own. I'm not trying to deter anyone from buying, but I think we have all done enough re-buying of his music already. Just think about what you already own and what you really want.

And as always, keep loving Michael!",1290816000,4,4994,4.212565445026178

I mean the Man had already changed the course of Music as a Kid artist and then as a Adult artist with both Off the Wall and Thriller albums.  thing is he took the mini film of Music video to a whole different level. His vision took a cool song and gave it a whole new life.  his dance moves and creativity came together as one.  there was nothing with Creativity that the Man could not do. he truly had that Once in a Lifetime ""IT"" that combines and connects.  bottom line and I might add the songs stand up well regardless of a video or not because Don't Stop til you get enough is a Jam period. that video looked like it was shot at the local carnival, however MJ made it cool rocking the tux. same with ROck with you where MJ was doing the dance the Rock.

Beat It good combination of modern and West Side Story. THriller was cool and on point.the Break down of dancing and the instrumental are cold. the Billie Jean Video was cold and it worked with the Mystery and Aura. to me the Bad era was where the MJ Video Pioneer era truly took off,he really stepped up the game from there. He Brought the Streets and everything else in between to the stage.

he influenced all acts that came after him with the music and the visual concepts and images. remember the time  was a great concept and the laid back feel of Stranger in Moscow.  so much irony for the video for ""One More Chance"".

i Miss the Brother and he made me a Music fan and not a day don't go by when I don't think about him,because he was that Dude. Trendsetter, Ground-Breaker, Creative Knight and the Jackie Robinson of Modern Music he truly paved the way and opened a whole lot of doors for so much.

4260752,2,B004498KPU,"I am a life-long Michael Jackson fan. Over the years I had been waiting for him to release a fully comprehensive, remastered set of his brilliant short films. Unfortunately, this project came about posthumously. Apart from the beautiful golden packaging and overall concept, I am not pleased with this product. Before ordering this product I was aware of some of its shortcomings such as the very shortened version of Ghosts being included but believed that the pros will outweigh the cons: wrong. The way his videos are presented in this set is a shame: the very thick black frame around many of the videos is the most irritating aspect. I don't really believe that the quality of these videos is better than others that I have previously seen. Blood on the Dancefloor is the remix version which is horrible compared to the original. Too many complaints to list here. This set could have been more than incredible if they had just put more effort and thought into it. MJ's videos are a huge part of his life-long career and very important to his artistic vision and legacy. If they truly cared, they would've done right by MJ and his fans.",1290729600,10,1140,4.705

The case says the content is formatted for Wide Screen, but I did not see any way to change the display ratio with my DVD player. So I am happy with the content and to be able to see it, but disappointed with the presentation size - I expected it to at least fill a standard screen :-(",1290729600,7,500,4.112244897959184
4260754,3,B004498KPU,"This DVD set is really a fantastic collection of some great work by the late and great Michael Jackson. The reason I rate this 3 stars is because, On the box it clearly says ""ALL 35 SHORT FILMS IN FULL"".  Lie.  ""Smooth Criminal"" Is the 10 minute version. Smooth Criminal in it's full version is more around 30,or 35 minutes.  ""Ghost"" Was always my favorite short film! I think it was a wonderful amazing peice of work. However the DVD gives us a edited 4 minute version of the film. Originaly 35 minutes. Ghost was never released on DVD so when I read that this had Ghost in its full I WAS SOO EXCITED, I got home clicked play and it wasnt. Guys and gals, don't be fooled as I was. If you don't care about those 2 wonderful videos then this set is super fantastic. Just to let you no, don't buy it for Ghost like I did.",1290643200,3,819,4.138364779874214
4260755,5,B004498KPU,"Michael Jackson's Vision is truly worth buying for any fan of MJ. It has superior visual quality and sounds perfect. It's presentation is worthy of that of Michael Jackson and his estate. I'm only a bit dissapointed in a few aspects. For once, it doesn't have the full version of ""Ghosts"", which has a longer storyline and this collection just shows a standard video. The video for ""Once More Chance"" isn't really worth watching, not is ""Cry"". ""Once More Chance"" only shows Michael filmed from his back, and you never see his face and doesn't have any storyline - same for ""Cry"" - Michael isn't shown at all. It's just people holding hands across America. The reaminder of the showcase it the best Michael has to offer and much restored and superior visual quqlity like never seen before.

Note to the Michael Jackson Estate: Please release concert video's of Michael Jackson in Concert, but digitally enhanced. You'll make millions for the estate!!
I would live to have Videos of the Victory, Bad, Dangerous and History tours as part of my MJ video colletion.

Thanks in advance.",1290643200,2,1080,4.801075268817204
4260756,4,B004498KPU,"""Michael Jackson's Vision"" looks like an incredible purchase on paper... ALL of Michael Jackson's videos housed in 1 box on 3 DVDs!
Sure, there are a few exceptions (which I will mention in my review) but overall the content in this box set is amazing.
Michael Jackson's music videos are always entertaining to watch and to have 4 and a half hours of pure MJ magic is worth any price in my eyes!
Now here are my gripes with this box set..

1) Widescreen format?
It says on the box that all the videos are formatted to fit your widescreen television..but this is LIES!
Nearly all the videos bar the more modern ones (You Rock My World, Cry, Remember The Time, Will You Be There - these are the only ones-) are all in a 4:3 format..which is fine because nearly all of these videos were made before the 16:9 widescreen format age begun. HOWEVER they appear on the screen in a small ""postcard"" format! A small box in the middle of the screen surrounded by 4 black bars! Not 2...but 4!
Not gonna lie, this is a really crappy way to watch MJs music videos.. all of his previous releases were in 4:3 but were formatted to fit the screen. On my DVD player in the living room I had to continuously change the setting to 'fit the screen' which was annoying but I could deal with it. On my player in the bedroom I have no such feature so I am stuck with watching it as a small square in the screen!

2) Remastered?
Some of these videos look amazing and I will give credit where credit is due.. ""Black or White"" in particular looks the best I have EVER seen it! So does ""Smooth Criminal"" and ""Don't Stop Til' You Get Enough""..but some videos still look like pure crap! Namely ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" and ""Will You Be There""...the transfer is grainy, fuzzy, blurry and VHS like! This proves to me they couldn't salvage this footage at all to qualify a Blu-Ray high definition release. But most of the videos look halfway decent and as I said some videos really shine so I can look past this more than I can with the widescreen issue.

3) Inclusion/Removal of videos?
My main issue is with the ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" video..why the hell did they include the lame remix? The original video/song doesnt even compare to the subpar remix version they include on here! It doesnt even say on the packaging that its the remix! I was disappointed by this...but I guess I have my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Number-Ones/dp/B0000TB014/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Number Ones</a>&nbsp;DVD to watch that on..but it makes this set far from what it claimed to be.
And finally the ""Ghosts"" video.. It would have been really nice to include the 34 minute version..there was so much space left on the 3rd disc so it would have been easy to include it! Why not? I can see Sony selling it sometime in the future on its own which would be very very money grubbing to the fans who thought it would be included on this ""concise"" box set.

However the box set apart from these (in my mind huge) flaws, is a really special thing to own! Its inclusion of never before released videos ""Why"", ""Say Say Say"", ""One More Chance"" and ""They Dont Care About Us (Prison Version)"" is a definite plus.

The packaging is incredible with the lithographic images on the front with the transparent metallic gold case and the cool gold box and 60 page booklet. This is definitely one of the highlights.
The DVD box is smaller compared to standard DVD cases..Its around the size of a Blu-Ray box so don't be fooled that this is a High Definition release, there are only DVD discs here.

The videos in themselves are amazing and will always stand the test of time, but I had to deduct 1 star for Sony's false information on the box about the screen format, the ""Blood on the Dance Floor"" and ""Ghosts"" video and the so-called Remastering.",1290556800,30,3859,4.577424023154848
4260757,3,B004498KPU,"I've got to say, I'm rather disappointed in this set. My main complaint is that more than half the videos are presented in full-screen format even though the packaging states the set is formatted for widescreen. I guess they mean it will display full-screen properly on your widescreen TV and not necessarily that all the videos are PRESENTED in widescreen. The videos that are presented in widescreen are fuzzy and seem out of focus. This review is coming from someone who is spoiled by the quality of blu-ray and whom hasn't bought a standard DVD in over 2 years. So maybe what I am complaining about is just standard DVD quality that I've long forgotten about, 6x less the resolution than what I am used to viewing. Either way, the video quality (for something that was supposed to be remastered for color) looks like laserdisc quality at around 420 LTV, with that old VHS-looking screen jittering and linear block-like fuzz. I actually compared the quality of these videos to my VISIONARY set, and sure enough, the quality is identical minus dirt specs, so obviously the color remastering they are boasting is strongly attributed to dirt removal. I guess that alone is an improvement, but just know the videos do not look any better than they ever have as far as resolution goes. People used to DVD quality will probably be more than happy with it and not notice a thing. Again, maybe I am so spoiled by 1080p blu-ray quality that my expectations were set too high for 480p resolution, but honestly most of the videos look like laserdisc with 420 lines of TLV and not even 480p. I've seen some decent 480p DVDs upconverted on my 1080p set and look close to 720p but this set just disappoints my every expectation. I know these videos are old, but come on! Jazz the quality up a little and don't sell us something we already have! I traded in my Greatest Hits 1 & 2 DVDs as well as my Dangerous Short Films DVD for $1 each preparing for this set to replace them, but technically this is the same exact thing I already had, just in one box. I'm really disappointed, and when I emailed Sony about a blu-ray release, I got no response. It is what it is I guess. This is still Michael Jackson and I still am glad to have this collection on my shelf. The book is cool, but beware it's cardboard covering and not hardcover.. I thought ""hard-bound"" meant something thicker than cardstock, but what do I know. It's worth $28 on Amazon but I wouldn't spent anything more than $30 on it anywhere else. I think my biggest complaint is I just want to see Michael in all his amazing glory, and the quality of this set doesn't allow for that :( Come on Sony, where is my Blu-Ray?",1290556800,8,2668,4.503092783505155
4260758,5,B004498KPU,"Omg, this is the best Michael Jackson dvd collection ever! It truly captures what a an amazingly talent man Michael Jackson was! I get chills just watching him perform! As soon as I got this on Monday, I played all the dvds for hours. Again, this is the best MJ collection ever.",1290556800,,278,4.365384615384615
4260759,4,B004498KPU,"I just received MJ's Vision and have a widescreen HDTV (1080p) and agree with the previous reviewer - the black bars are on both sides of the screen (in 4:3 ratio), which I found annoying - so I changed the ratio on my TV to 16:9, and the black bars are thinner - but you still do not get the true widescreen display.  When I re-adjusted to full widescreen on the TV, the resolution becomes diminished and the picture somewhat distorted.  Also, the film ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is quite grainy and at certain spots actually fades.  I've only viewed Disc 1 so far so can't comment on the rest of the films.  I don't understand why VISION's remastered short films are not released in true widescreen movie format.  Sound production is fantastic though.  Anyone has any ideas?

Update: I finished viewing the remainder of Vision, and the following are a few additional comments:
  1)  ""Man In The Mirror"" - video comprised of collage of newsclips of major/important events.  This great song was Michael's anthem, and I would prefer to watch this from a live concert film because he sang it with such meaning and desparate urgency.
  2)  ""Another Part of Me"" - live concert footage.  Michael in full stride and at the height of his magnetic powers.  I've seen this on YouTube, but on a big TV screen, it blows you away and fully demonstrates why his fans go nutso at his concerts.  Sheryl Crow, who toured with Michael on the Bad concerts, said that she will never see talent like this again.  His executors really must see to it that all Michael's concerts are released on DVD.  The guy was awesome!
  3)  ""Gone Too Soon"" - a different version from the Dangerous short films, which I've not seen before.  Extremely poignant, and at the end, in the final photograph, your heart stops.
  4)  The Jacksons' videos (""Blame It On The Boogie,"" ""Enjoy Yourself"") and ""Say, Say, Say"" (with Paul McCartney) - Michael in his youth - exuberant, fun-loving, exploding with energy - a real treat (and you will find youself watching only Michael - not his brothers).
  5)  I wish there were more . . .

All in all, a magnificent collection to have - and we are reminded again how great and expansive was his genius.  Someone like Michael Jackson comes only once, and it is our great deprivation that we lost him.",1290556800,,2298,4.5588235294117645
4260760,3,B004498KPU,"For anybody that was fine with the quality of the videos on other collections, you'll be okay, but if somebody is expecting pristine, hi-def quality remasters of the videos, prepare to be disappointed.  I don't know what qualifies as remastering the videos (as the sticker on the front of this proclaims), but I was disappointed.  Some of the videos look better than others, but I fail to believe that they went back to source materials to remaster many if any of these.  I have the previous DVDs and don't really see much of an improvement.  Also, all of the clips from Moonwalker look like they just ripped them from a VHS copy.  In fact, at the end of Speed Demon, there's even some good old fashioned tape stretch distortion at the bottom of the screen.  A really half-assed effort.

To be fair though, the audio sounds better than before.

Also, aside from the missing full-length Ghosts mini-movie that others have already advised of, this collection is far from complete.

In fact, this is not even just the Ghosts segment/dance routine as many, including myself, assumed it would be.  This is an edit of footage from the Ghosts mini-movie set to the song.  It's mostly the dance number, but throws in other footage in such a way that, unless you've watched the original version online or through imported copies, it will make little-to-no sense at all.  They didn't even keep the footage of Michael doing the Rihanna ""Single Ladies"" walk/dance move that he did first.  A real disappointment.

4260761,3,B004498KPU,"I went to play the dvd on my standard tv (I do not have a widescreen TV) and noticed black bars on the the sides of the screen.  I am used to black bars appearing on the top and bottom of my screen (widescreen format), but not on the sides.  I attempted to adjust settings on my dvd player, but nothing worked.  I looked on the packaging and it says ""Formatted for Widescreen Televisions"".  Are you kidding me?  I now have to watch all of the videos inside of a large black box or buy a brand new TV?

This makes absolutely no sense.  Even largely released moves might be ""Enhanced for Widescreen TVs"", but not specifically formatted for them.  This is dissapointing as I cannot enjoy these videos as intended, because they are not being presented as intended.  I could understand if this was a Blu-Ray release, but it isn't, it is just dvd.

I gave 3 stars for it being the most comprehensive collection...to date and I'll eventually get a widescreen TV.  I still think it is absurd that these dvds were released like this.",1290470400,7,1024,4.422459893048129

If I had realized that this set wasn't goung to be a COMPLETE set of the FULL MJ video collection, I would have saved my money and at least waited for a Blu-Rey version.

I already have all of these brilliant short films (Except for One More Chance) on vhs tapes from years of taping everything Michael premiered on MTV, VH-1 BET ect....I am very proud of my personal collection and recently did my best to put them on dvd. So why purchase this package if I have everything? Well its a simple answer: I am a true to the heart Michael Jackson fan and I knew it would be put together in a way I could never accomplish. I was right! this is a beautiful package and its something any true fan will cherish. The only disappointment is that GHOSTS was drastically shortened from the original 30+ minutes to a little over 4 minutes...luckily I have the original full length version in my own collection.

4260768,5,B004498KPU,"I have and always will be a true die hard fan of Michael Jackson. On June 25th, 2009, I can honestly say i've never really been depressed over the death of a celebrity, but his death effected me. I don't just love Michael as artist, but I loved him for his personality. He was a true humanatrian and very humble person. He cared about his family, friends, the planet earth, and last but not least, his loving fans. I was very eagerly excited that he was going to tour in 2009 and eventually tour in the United States. Unforunatley, my dream of seeing him live was crushed but I am glad he in a better place now.

Well, I will get to the review of this DVD box set. I am glad they decided to release all of his music videos all in one set. They are all released with restored color and remastering sound. I am proud to see they finally released the ""One More Chance"" video, which Michael was working on in 2003. Also I see they have included the hard to find ""She's Out Of My Life"", which you can see Michael at a very young age in 1980 singing with such passion. Of course, you get all of the classic videos, ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", ""Bad"", ""Scream"", ""Remember The Time"", ""Smooth Criminal"", and need do I mention ""Thriller"", and many many more of his classic videos. Also including three videos with ""The Jacksons"". The duet video ""Say Say Say"" with Paul McCartney and the duet with his three nephews ""3T"" for the video ""Why"".

There's just a few things that bothered me with the release of this DVD. The first thing is, in which I know alot of fans are mad because of this but they released the short version of ""Ghosts"". They released the 4 mintue video instead of the 38 minute video. If they could of included the long versions of ""Bad"", ""Thriller"", ""You Rock My World"" & ""Smooth Criminal"", they could of included the full 38 minute video clip of ""Ghosts. The 2nd thing is that they are missing a couple of videos. Where is the rarley seen video of ""Human Nature""? Also, if they included both videos for ""They Don't Care About Us"", why didn't they include both videos for ""Who Is It?"". The second video is for ""Who Is It?"" is a video of all of Michael's video shown together in diffirent clips. An the 3rd thing is why did they release the remix version of ""Blood On The Dance Floor""?, they should of just included the original version of the song just like all the rest of his videos.

Besides for that, this is a great release for Michael Jackson. If your a die hard fan, new fan, or a seldom fan, I would recommend this box set to you to see the King Of Pop at his best. I am also eagerly excited for the new album next month, titled ""Michael"". Even though the songs are being released without his blessings of perfection, we get something new & fresh. The album will no where be in the standards of ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"", & ""Dangerous"", but i'm sure it will be great!
