It would be safe to assume that only a small percentage of people who get a chance to witness this film will actually be able to finish it. Even though I didn't enjoy it, I felt obligated to finish it to further assert its disgustingness. The director is keen on extending the most disgusting scenes of the movie to an unbearable point. You will turn your head away. The film contains bestiality, cacophagy (eating excrement) and some scenes of dead animals and animals being abused. There is no dialogue, just a man alone with a bunch of farm animals.

This film has interesting points to it, the ambient/Gregorian chant soundtrack was nice, the camera work and setting shot in high contrast B&W definitely create an uneasy atmosphere. The film itself struck me as sort of the story of a man with no contact with the outside world and how he simply lives primitively, impulsively like an animal himself.
