3053038,3,B0010X746O,"I got the REBUS series on DVD from Amazon after reading the Ian Rankin novels.  While there are differences, I enjoyed Kan Stott in the title role, more so than the other actor in earlier adaptations.  I thought I would try this show because of Mr. Stott.  I like it, but it is a rougher type of situation as you would expect being about a Vice rather than a murder squad.  Still, I found it better than watching  Law and Order SVU.
If you like British police show, try the REBUS series and GEORGE GENTLY and JACK TAYLOR and VERA as well as the old standard PRIME SUSPECT.
If you have been watching DOWNTON ABBEY, it will be fun to spot some of the actors in earlier roles!
There are a whole lot of other interesting British mystery/cop show aside from the MORSE, INSPECTOR LINDLEY, INSPECTOR LEWIS and the new SHERLOCK which you can find if you have seen these on PBS and liked them.
Some are more humorous than others - don't miss A TASTE OF FROST, PIE IN THE SKY and THE LAST DETECTIVE. Usually when you get one of the DVDs there is a trailer showing clips from other shows which is how I got hooked on these.  There are others as well.  Of course, don't forget the MIDSOMMER MURDER series which is  now into set 23 as well.
Once you find you like this type of  show, it is like eating potato chips - you can't stop with just one.  It is fun finding new (and old) shows, watching various actors in different roles over the years ( Inspector Foyle of FOYLE'S WAR as a jewel thief or a conman, Downton's Duke as a serial killer, Mr. Bates as a police chief superintendant, a drug smuggling nightclub owner or again a serial killer).  Have  a good time investigating !!!",1395446400,,1670,4.300319488817891

3053040,4,B0010X746O,"I've just re-watched this series and season (I'd seen it in 1999) and, like  most good drama, it's even better the second time. The acting is excellent, the script strong, the stories and their pacing highly professional. The main character, Pat Chappell (Ken Stott) is worldly, realistic, but sympathetic, often feeling akin to those working within an industry (i.e. sex) with many grey areas and based on aliases, fantasies, deceptions and (not-always) casual encounters: It's the exploiters he detests. The proceedings, though dealing with sex, are quite unerotic, and one is left depressed, perhaps how the vice squad as portrayed here may feel at the end of the day.
Note: it is interesting, given era the series was made, to compare nineties' high tech with today's. And if any commerce has benefitted from technological advance, it's the oldest one.",1388448000,2,856,5.158273381294964

3053045,1,B0010X746O,I'm hooked on British dramas and mysteries but this one let me down. It's much too gritty and dark. I didn't come to care for any of the main characters. I don't know if it's true of all the seasons but series one ended and left me totally hanging. I'm not interested enough to pay for season two to see what happened. I can't say I care for that at all. Stott is very good and I really like Caroline Catz but not in this. Sorry but I didn't like it.,1348099200,7,450,3.956043956043956
3053046,5,B0010X746O,"If you like Ken Stott in Rebus, you'll like this earlier effort.  The subject matter is pretty seamy, particularly for American TV audiences, which is probably why it never made it to PBS or A&E.  It does have a little of ""The Wire"" feel to it, but it's clearly Ken Stott's vehicle as DI Pat Chapel.  Stott plays Chapel like a younger Rebus who still feels a certain degree of devotion to the job and not just to the crime at hand.  But, like Rebus, Chapel is a flawed character constantly flirting with on the job disasters, mostly of his own making.  His subordinates are affected by the nature of the work and his less than stellar management style, but in the end they catch the bad guys.

The series has a few unusual twists and turns with one of the stars coming to an early end in Season  2 which, apparently, is all we're allowed to see of the generally excellent series.  The show ran for 5 years on British TV, but so far only the first two seasons have been released on DVD.  Since the show originally ran starting in 1998-99 I don't hold out a lot of hope for the balance of the episodes.  Again, the subject matter is rough with all the expected violence and nudity, but the acting and scripts are first rate.  Just don't expect ""Midsomer Murders"".",1261612800,32,1261,4.369098712446352

3053107,4,B0010X746O,"I'll be honest -- I bought it because it was $5 at the time. But I enjoyed it right from the start. Ken Stott plays Pat Chapel, head of the Vice Unit, whose job seems to be less about arresting prostitutes than catching the pimps and pornographers that make license possible.  In episode 1, a prostitute is murdered, and it's the Vice Unit's job to determine why and by whom.  It's a great introduction to the ensemble cast -- Chapel himself, his right-hand man and moral pillar, the naive rookie, and the experienced-but-slightly-jaded officer.

In episode 2, the Vice Unit is trying to reopen a cold case involving a murdered underage male prostitute while preventing another such young man from ending up the same. In episode 3, the rookie goes undercover to expose a combination prostitution/drug ring, but his feelings for an ""escort"" might draw him in further than he should go.

If season 2 ever drops to a reasonable price, I'll plunk down for it.  My only complaint that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the subplot concerning adultery.  I suppose it's there to show the flawed aspect of our ""heroes"", but it's a disappointing fallback.",1441497600,,1147,4.738693467336684

Although there is an ever so slight lean to the left politically, the show gives a very unique and reasonably balanced view of the subjects they cover.  I have now seen all of the episodes up to current date, and will continue to watch.  I like how they break up the episodes into two topics, and although they are short, they cover each subject rather thoroughly.

If you are into culture, world events, and an alternative view to what the mainstream feeds you, I would highly recommend this show.  Although I am a libertarian, and I could see a few points of political leaning, it wasn't enough to deter me from enjoying and being educated by the content they put forth.

From terrorists to poaching, children armies to extreme dictators. Drug wars to Religious wars. VICE is an amazing insight into what is going on today. (i must warn that it does show graphic content, which although horrible to see adds to the truth of what is happening)

also, do not listen to any of the other comments that talk about it being a British show over 15 years old or being a drama packed series. They are obviously referring to the series THE VICE. Not this series which is called VICE.",1402358400,,859,4.506410256410256

It's a great introduction to the ensemble cast -- Chapel himself, his right-hand man and moral pillar, the naive rookie, and the experienced-but-slightly-jaded officer.

In episode 2, the Vice Unit is trying to reopen a cold case involving a murdered underage male prostitute while preventing another such young man from ending up the same. In episode 3, the rookie goes undercover to expose a combination prostitution/drug ring, but his feelings for an ""escort"" might draw him in further than he should go.

If season 2 ever drops to a reasonable price, I'll plunk down for it.  My only complaint that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the subplot concerning adultery.  I suppose it's there to show the flawed aspect of our ""heroes"", but it's a disappointing fallback.",1441497600,,1147,4.738693467336684

Although there is an ever so slight lean to the left politically, the show gives a very unique and reasonably balanced view of the subjects they cover.  I have now seen all of the episodes up to current date, and will continue to watch.  I like how they break up the episodes into two topics, and although they are short, they cover each subject rather thoroughly.

If you are into culture, world events, and an alternative view to what the mainstream feeds you, I would highly recommend this show.  Although I am a libertarian, and I could see a few points of political leaning, it wasn't enough to deter me from enjoying and being educated by the content they put forth.

If anyone really wants to understand what is going on outside of the US. i would recommend watching VICE. Although gory, it holds many truths and reveals many evils that are still present today. From terrorists to poaching, children armies to extreme dictators. Drug wars to Religious wars. VICE is an amazing insight into what is going on today. (i must warn that it does show graphic content, which although horrible to see adds to the truth of what is happening)

also, do not listen to any of the other comments that talk about it being a British show over 15 years old or being a drama packed series. They are obviously referring to the series THE VICE. Not this series which is called VICE.",1402358400,,859,4.506410256410256

I've been addicted to VICE ever since they first started!
Now they are a big shot HBO show but they have preserved their originality and their authenticity.
If you're not familiar with the concept - they sent out their reporters onsite. The reporters mingle with the protagonist of the reportage - that could be ISIS soldiers, drug dealers, illegal immigrants trying to cross the border. The result is an exceptional firsthand account of this totally different world that otherwise you would have never caught a glimpse of.
The standard media normally reports the facts and drowns you in analysis and opinions.
