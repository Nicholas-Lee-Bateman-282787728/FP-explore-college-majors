8463038,4,6301827732,"This borderline documentary of George Michael's career starting from WHAM! up until his Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 release is informative but not necessarily entertaining.  If you are a George Michael fan it is probably  already in your video library.  The video covers George in the studio as  well where he talks about how he generally writes and records his tracks.  Now that we know so much more about George Michael's ""private  life"" this video seems to be a bit out-dated, however it's worth your  buck if you can't live without a hot brit with a hip sound.",923184000,3,568,4.73469387755102
