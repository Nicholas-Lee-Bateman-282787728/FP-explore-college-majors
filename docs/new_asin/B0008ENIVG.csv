2258059,5,B0008ENIVG,"To begin with, I have all 3 sets. There has nothing on TV that comes close to this show in composition and thought. The actors,

well, they are perfect for the roles they have been chosen for and they evoke the emotional response that they set out to do.

La Femme Nikita rises above the rest like they did not even exist! I just wish there were a Season 4!!!!",1135123200,7,360,4.128571428571429
2258060,4,B0008ENIVG,"I had videotaped all of the programs live, but that included the commercials, and the quality of the tapes were not near as clear as the CDs.  It's a great package for true La Femme Nikita fans.  Hopefully the shortened ""Fourth"" season will be available in the future.",1123632000,11,268,4.5625
2258061,5,B0008ENIVG,"Thank goodness they decided to release this series on DVD! I had heard rumors that they wouldn't, but thankfully they were just rumors! If you are a fan of this series or just like kick butt woman you have to get the series! Hooray!",1123459200,7,232,4.295454545454546
8055763,5,B0008ENIVG,Peta is wonderfull to watch and listen too.  She is evolving as a killer but still remains true to herself at not killing in cold blood.  Micheal is finally acting more human.,1365292800,,175,4.4375
8055764,5,B0008ENIVG,"I bought this series for a family member, and she said it was just great!  The price was much better at the time I bought these;  but I think we siblings split it anyway.  The DVDs played like they were supposed to; and the whole kit came in on time, if I remember correctly.",1355961600,,275,4.055555555555555
8055765,4,B0008ENIVG,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00008ZL4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita: The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;I don't have season 3 yet but I do plan on buying it eventually.  I absolutely agree with those that say the video presentation is very poor on DVD but that is not Amazon's fault.  However this spy series is one of the best I've ever seen and I enjoy watching it over and over.  The characters are diverse and rich and ""Control"" is everything an autonomous ""black bag"" operation should be about.  Power and control.  Michael is sometimes scary he is so cold and somber.  Nikita is the only human aspect in the Section and of course Madeline would eat her own kids if need be.  Perfect for her role in this made for TV ""spy"" series.  Overall, regardless of the poor quality of the DVD presentation which again I mention the fact that this is the fault of the production company and not Amazon; the series is entertaining, for the spy buff and what can I say about the two lead actors, Peta Wilson is fine as frog's hair and Roy Dupuis is a lady killer, no pun intended.  I wanted to give this 5-stars but the video is again very poor and in this day and age, good video on a DVD is not that hard to do.  So enjoy, escape for a while and enjoy these episodes if you are into the genre.  By the way, this series plays somewhat better on a plain DVD player than on a Blu-ray player, I've tried both.",1265673600,,1500,4.797665369649805
8055766,5,B0008ENIVG,I have always enjoyed this show when it was on TV.  i am just thrilled to death to know that I can now watch this series whenever I want to.,1215129600,,140,3.6666666666666665
8055767,5,B0008ENIVG,"I have always loved this series, better than the two movies, and bought all the DVDs available.  When a friend of mine raved about Alias, I watched a few episodes and got so irritated at their blatant plagerism of this wonderful series.  Plus Peta Wilson has Jennifer Garner beat hands down.",1213747200,,291,4.686274509803922
8055768,5,B0008ENIVG,"This series was written, produced, and acted at a level of quality far above most other TV shows.  Few episodes of the best current TV shows come close in quality.  Owning the season sets on DVD enables me to re-view them in a better format than video and to store them in a small fraction of the space my videos had required.  I am so glad I bought them!",1154390400,,355,4.115942028985507
8055769,5,B0008ENIVG,"This has got to be one of the best shows that was ever on TV.  Yes, it is dark and has an element of despair, but the plots, characters and acting is top-notch.  You can see why other shows like Alias pale in comparison.

And for the people who asked, Season 4 will be out on July 25th.  See http://tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=5468 for more info.",1145145600,4,355,4.587301587301587
8055770,5,B0008ENIVG,I have watched all the episodes and they are fine.  Every season gets better and better.,1138406400,3,88,4.5
8055771,5,B0008ENIVG,"Ahead of its time when it began in 1997, La Femme Nikita is ""Mission Impossible,"" ""Alias,"" and ""24"" wrapped up in one show that transcends political and cultural boundaries. During its run, it also broke ground for its hip selection of alternative music.

The show provides well-developed and overlapping story lines; intelligent characters with complicated and wounded souls; cutting-edge wardrobe and set design; and the realistic portrayal of a world in which conflicting Western values, not just American ones, are weighed against one another.

LFN draws attention to the moral ambiguities we face in a global war on terror. Still ahead of its time today, it asks us to weigh the consequences of actions we choose in battling terror -- consequences for our own moral standing, our liberties, our very lives.

The DVD set is worth buying for the original series alone, but it includes numerous behind-the-scenes extras and commentaries that add even more value.",1137283200,9,964,5.2064516129032254
8055772,1,B0008ENIVG,I am extremely disapointed. the quality of the video was terrible the outdoor scenes are dark and the darker scenes  such as a warehouse or nightclub the actors are almost invisible a terrible way to treat such a great series.,1135468800,,226,4.65
