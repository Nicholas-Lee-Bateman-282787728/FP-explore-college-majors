8275583,2,B0019X3YSW,"Remember in DiCaprio's ""Titanic"", they looked at the rotting ship at the bottom of the ocean once, but the movie was about human relationships and special effects that would get people's attention now.  This DVD is more than two hours of looking at corroded ships and planes.  So they spice things up by showing the war footage of why the vehicles went into the waters.  They interview the modern divers frequently who are filming these sunken warships in order to add a human touch.  They speak about sharks and bombs and carbon monoxide poisoning and many other matters that illustrate how difficult the dives are.  This work was a little too long for my test, but I think many viewers, mostly older men, would simply love it.  Also, they focus on WWII and WWI vehicles.  I think I would have been more interested if they looked at even older ships, especially if they could have pulled some gold or ancient maps from the ruins.  See the documentary on the Antorcha for something more exciting.",1220659200,4,996,4.683908045977011
