8455426,5,B0053O8AUA,"This is a two part PBS special on the Mexican Revolution that took place in the early part of the 20th century.  Most Americans barely know there was a revolution, really a civil war, in Mexico, or that the U.S. had an active military part in this conflict.  The documentary is very well produced, and immensely informative. This documentary is one view, to be sure, and it necessarily had to somewhat limit its scope of an incredibly complex military and political struggle that had many sides (not just two) and many shifting loyalties.  Nonetheless, it is a great way to start to learn a little of the history and culture of our southern neighbor, and forth largest trading partner. The Mexican Revolution was an important to Mexico as the American Civil War was to the north.  The DVD was available from the PBS website at one point.",1400457600,3,837,4.673469387755102

8455428,5,B0053O8AUA,"Yo vi este documental por casualidad, mientras se ve PBS de Boston. Slo en muy raras ocasiones lo hace los medios de EEUU informe completa y precisa sobre Mxico. Por lo general, los informes se centran en el caos, la violencia y el sensacionalismo. Este documental es una rara excepcin. Viva Mxico.

By chance, I watched this documentary last year on PBS out of Boston. Very rarely does the US media report accurately on Mexico. Usually, they are focused on chaos, violence and sensationalism.  This documentary is a rare exception.",1343260800,4,532,4.9
8455429,5,B0053O8AUA,I am a cultural anthropologist and teach Latin America survey course at a University.  My field work was conducted in Mexico and so Mexico is my primary country of interest.  I use documentaries for my classes when possible.  I can't wait for this one to become available.  I am currently designing a course devoted to Mexico because of its special--and important--relationship to the United States.  This documentary will make my job much easier as it will give the students a strong intellectual and visual impression of the real Mexico.  I thank all of those who made this documentary--it is truly a wonderful accomplishment.,1328227200,6,628,5.048543689320389
8455430,4,B0053O8AUA,Very concise...interesting...& enlightening.  A new respect for Mexico has replaced many preconceived misconceptions.  Of particular interest was their immigration policy in regards to exiles during WWII.  It made me wonder if the Statue Of Liberty should have beem moved to Veracruz?,1316908800,7,284,5.878048780487805
8455431,5,B0053O8AUA,"This feature documentary was first broadcast nationally on PBS in May 2011 and should have several other broadcasts on PBS in the next 3 years, including the one I saw tonight.  Lots of interviews in Spanish with English subtitles, which makes it easy to miss some of the story, so I would enjoy seeing this again and eventually purchasing a copy when it is available.

The two hour program is divided into two parts:  Part 1 begins with the overthrow of dictator Porfirio Diaz in 1910 through ten bloody years of armed conflict, which is a complicated history but well told.  Part 2 tells the story of the legacy of the revolution and ends with the shocking 1968 massacre at the Tlatelolco housing project in Mexico City.  Anyone with any interest in our southern neighbor will benefit from this excellent program by understanding better the turmoil they have been through these past hundred years.",1316476800,13,899,4.811688311688312
8455432,5,B0053O8AUA,"I had the good fortune of catching this when it first aired, and it was riveting. I have been on looking to purchase ever since. Can't wait for DVD to finally be released.",1307491200,11,171,4.212121212121212
