8035442,1,B000300QFQ,"Maybe I have a "" off"" copy. You are basically watching a class preform this art in a choppy no explaination fashion. The production is just pathetic, sound quality horrible.  The camera operator needs to learn how to film, If your wanting to learn this art like I am , theres no way to learn from this set. Dont waste your money. This is the second awful production by Mr Alexander that Ive had the misfortune of buying. He needs to quit charging people for this. If I could return this I would. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS.",1287964800,,517,4.329896907216495
8035443,5,B000300QFQ,"Professor Ferreira makes it very easy to understand the movement, breaking it down step by step, then full speed, and then how you would do it in a roda. Plus, there's amazing footage of his students in the roda. I would recommend this set to EVERYONE.",1203120000,,252,4.5
8035444,5,B000300QFQ,This three volume set is awesome. The whole set brings together all of Caooeira for me. It has lots of demonstrations that show fully this exotic art. It breaks down each move in detail so that it can be easily leaned. This is what I was really looking for and it is much cheaper to buy the set than individually purchase them. A great deal!!,1095379200,,342,4.276923076923077
