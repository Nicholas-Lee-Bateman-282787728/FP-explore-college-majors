7812679,2,6301555996,"This is a wonderful, exciting, moving rendition of Mahler 2, the picture is crisp and two of the three speeches are included.  The most dramatic and important speech, by then Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was taken out for reasons beyond my knowledge.  If you're interested in listening to the music, buy the CD.  The sound on the video is perfectly awful.  The level is absurdly low and turning up the volume only amplifies the hiss, behind which there is a muddy, indistinct shadow of the music.  I only bought the video, in a moment of maudlin nostalgia, because I happen to be in it, playing my trumpet as a bright-eyed kid.  I don't understand the point of producing a music video without paying attention to the sound.  This technical incompetence is an embarrassment and a disservice to the musicians not to mention the listeners.",1213315200,,837,4.770833333333333
7812680,4,6301555996,"Despite what the other reviewer has said about the technical aspect of the video, which is correct...there is some hiss, but furthermore I have to say that this is an excellent live account of the ""Resurrection"".  There is about a 15 minute talk at the start of the video, by two famous individuals that talk about the significance of the date of the performance and about Mahler and Mehta...It was the day Israel celebrated its freedom from something I can't remember right at this moment.  All you have to do is read the cover of the box! ""The concert that became a Legend""!...Mr. Mehta is quite well known for his readings of Mahler's Second, he has numerous recordings of it.  This interpretation is so hot that it's really a spectacular event your witnessing.  It was filmed on a mountain in the desert, they show footage of the set up of the stage and seating and talk about the importance of the setting of the performance. It's really quite amazing to see all the work that went into this famous historic day.  The hiss isn't really anything to worry about...What matters is the Resurrection of Spirit over Matter.",1047168000,,1122,4.675126903553299
7812681,1,6301555996,"Such a pity.  Mehta, a master in interpreting Mahler's scores, does a sterling job of conducting the Israel Philharmonic, which does an equally sterling job of playing.  The picture quality is razor sharp.  And then along comes a sound track that has, throughout the tape, a background hiss that cannot be ignored (it's not the speakers---I'm running a Bose Lifestyle system.)  The hiss is particularly noticeable and grating during the symphony's quiet passages, and dominated every bit of enjoyment I was trying so hard to maintain.  Don't buy it.  Wait until it comes out on DVD (if it does), and then check the reviews (if any) to see if the hiss was edited out during VHS/DVD transfer.  Bottom Line:  A major disappointment and a mark of technical shame on whatever sound studio was responsible for cutting the master tape.",1011052800,8,828,4.906474820143885
