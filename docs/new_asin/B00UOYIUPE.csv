7066966,1,B00UOYIUPE,"Olive films are one of those Independent blu-ray Distributors that don't bother making any effort
to give old classic films the respect they Deserve
most Olive films blu-ray's have no new special features at all
all you get is supposely new HD transfer with typical 2.0 stereo mix
and maybe an Audio commentary by the films Director if your lucky
but there's no making of featurettes, no archive featurettes carried over from the dvd versions
No theatrical trailers, no Photo gallery, what an incredible insult
Erik the viking is definitely one of those Great comedy classics from comedians like John cleese,Terry Jones, Charles McKeown
tragically Olive films didn't give this film any respect which is not surprising
no new special features, no nothing completely barebones,
the HD transfers are average and so is the sound quality just 2.0 mono sound, no new 5.1 mixes
their blu-ray's are not worth buying at all waste of money
but if you are a big fan of Erik the viking
then buy the 2 Disc dvd set from U.K. Arrowfilms which is ALL REGIONS DVD anyway
no need to worry if your player is region 1 locked
on this 2 disc set you get both Theatrical version & the new Directors cut version which is shorter cut than the Theatrical cut
both in 1:78:1 widescreen on this 2 disc set you get lots of special features
you get interviews with Terry Jones, John cleese
plus many featurettes, Making Erik the viking, casting of a comedy adventure, special effects of erik the viking, evolution of a director
plus Archive vintage TV promo of the film recorded during 1987 when the film was made
also an Audio commentary by Terry Jones
you can easily buy it off amazon uk and get it shipped to the U.S. or see if amazon has a listing of it
at least Arrow films have made an effort for this classic 80's film, so buy the Arrowfilms dvd instead
5 stars for the film, 1 star for this new blu-ray version, 5 stars for the Arrowfilms dvd",1432684800,9,1921,4.554913294797688
7066967,4,B00UOYIUPE,"My review is for the Blu-ray by Olive Films:

Here is a wonderful forgotten and silly comical movie, lovingly brought out on Blu-ray for the first time by the wonderful company Olive Films. This is in my viewpoint a must own Blu-ray for any lover of wonderful comedy. This is jam packed with an all star cast of actors and actresses.

Comedy, adventure and most of all fantasy come together in full force upon the viewer as one gut busting comical banter after another, showcases itself.

This is written by Terry Jones who also directed it, and starred in it. Jones is most famous for Monty Python fame. This movie is basically on that same type of humor. Fans of Monty Python will love this film and take to it. And it also has many other Python members throughout this film such as the wonderful, laugh out funny, hysterical John Cleese. Terry Jones also directed the comical Python masterpieces of silly humor, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life. So you can understand the humor that Erik the Viking will have.

Erik your main character is suppose to be a Viking. During one of the Viking groups, Rape and Pillage ordeals, he ends up accidentally killing a woman who made him start to question just what life is all about, whats the point of the, Rape and Pillage. Soon Erik starts to question everything, seeking answers and more out of his so called Viking life. So beings his adventure to find the Gods. He convinces the other Vikings on a journey to the mythical plain of Asgard. This brings forth Giant Sea creatures, legend and folklore around the pacing of silly comedy.

The British comedy lingers with you long after its over and you find yourself giggling hours later at moments in the film that stick with you. Now this film has had many versions. There are three different versions of this film. This Blu-ray is the full 107 minute version. The VHS release was 89 minutes. Also Terry Jones son edited it to a 75 minute version for the DVD. This Olive Films Blu-ray version is the full length, unedited version, which I think is solid. This film is not for everyone, its geared to fans that enjoy silly comical over the top ridiculous humor. As I have stated, fans of Monty Python will find this humorous. Those who love cinema of the comedy, or weird comedy reality will love this film. Cinema lovers will absolutely love the Blu-ray. The audio and video are good. Vibrant in color, crisp in sound. A wonderful example of a new outlet for this older film.

This is also being released on DVD. So you have the option of DVD or Blu-ray. I am reviewing the Blu-ray.

I watched the VHS version for years and years until the tape broke, then bought it on DVD only to be horrified that it was cut to shreds (including the omission of the best line in the whole movie).  It's too bad there are no extra features but the restoration of ""the line"" makes up for it. I love you, Terry Jones, and I know you wrote the book for your son Bill, but he butchered your movie version.",1452643200,7,469,4.043010752688172
7067010,5,B00UOYIUPE,"Best/Worst Python Movie Ever!

Only one problem, its not a Python film but rather one that has Python components. I gave up keeping track of how many edited cuts this movie has produced, but this has to be much closer to the full monty.

I will say that I can also empathize with viewers polar response. It brings to mind a quote from John Oliver, one of the truly great & calmly rational minds of our times. He once said:

When you take a classridden society with no ability to address its emotions, and let it simmer for a thousand years, you frankly have the perfect recipe for drama.

Drama, and also comedy. British comedy is definitely for those born with a genetically skewered look on life (like myself) or it is an acquired taste. Sort of like Miller beer. Makes you want to puke at first but after about 810 bottles the humor does reveal itself.

And then you puke!

And finally, kudos to the creators for the attention to Old Norse mythology while also avoiding that Hollywoodinspired historical inaccuracy of putting horns on the Vikings helmets. My dear Old Norwegian grandmother would have approved. (*sniffle*)

7067012,5,B00UOYIUPE,"'Erik The Viking' is a silly, Python-esque comedy for Terry Jones, based upon his book of the same name (created for his son).  The plot has been covered in numerous other reviews so I won't rehash it.

As for the blu-ray release:  The picture is superior to any previous release, without a doubt.  The sound mix can sometimes be uneven at times (sometimes when the characters speak softly the mix puts their dialog so low its necessary to turn up the volume a bit).  But that doesn't detract from the main plus with this disc:  For the first time since it appeared in theaters you get the full, 107 minute version of the movie.  The original videocassette Jones edited down to 89 minutes, then when the film debuted on DVD he cut it further (he still felt the film dragged too much) down to just 75 minutes.  With all due respect to his comic genius I totally disagree with Mr. Jones - the 107 minute version I originally saw in the theater was my favorite.  I personally felt the pacing was just fine, and that the 75 minute edit ran so quickly it was like watching an extended advertisement and not the actual movie!

Now if (like me) you have the 75 minute DVD - don't get rid of it!  The DVD contains some extras on it (such as a vintage 1989 'Making of' special) not on this blu-ray disc.  This release only contains the trailer as a bonus.  I myself had an extra 2 disc blu-ray case, so I put this disc artwork in the case and put the 75 minute DVD in the extra slot for convenience.

Missing bonus features aside, this is a very worth while blu-ray.  Enjoy the FULL adventure of Erik The Viking!",1440979200,12,1603,4.332214765100671

8707833,2,B00UOYIUPE,"This is not another Movie review.  If I didn't absolutely love this film, I wouldn't have bought it.  That being said, this is now the worst Blu-Ray transfer I own.  No special features, No commentary, and worst of all... NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!  The only ""extra"" you will receive is an inserted paper advertisement that shows all the other movies from OliveFilms that I now know NOT to purchase.  This should be a $5.00 Blu-ray, at best.

The main menu is a typical DVD style menu with the box art as the background.  You get three options, Movie, Chapters (of which there are only nine), and Trailer.  I'm giving this 2 stars as the transfer itself looks great... still grainy in some spots, but with a higher contrast and clarity overall.
At least it's presented in widescreen; unlike my old VHS copy.

This is a great satirical film, I only wish it had a better presentation.",1496361600,2,877,4.606451612903226
