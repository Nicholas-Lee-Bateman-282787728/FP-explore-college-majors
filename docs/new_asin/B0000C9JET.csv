7998295,5,B0000C9JET,"Kirika and Mirielle are assassins for hire. They'll rub out anyone for enough money. Kirika has anmesia. All she recalls is the skills she has as an assassin. A mafia organization has sanctioned them and sends hitmen to test their skills. What they don't know yet is that they are candidates to take the title of Noir, an ancient team of killers that is feared by the underworld.

Noir is a very stylish anime. The colors and the soundtrack create a very unique mood. The series has a lot of action and plenty of mystery. It's a very cool series. The characters are compelling and keep you wanting to watch more. I definitely think anyone, anime fan or not, can get a lot of enjoyment out of it.",1353974400,,695,4.4296875
7998296,4,B0000C9JET,"To me, Volume 6 of Noir was probably the most powerful installment of the series, so Volume 7 comes almost as an anti-climax. I had read reviews and heard rumors that this final Noir ended depressingly, but to me, it had a happy ending for some of the characters.

After learning, or rather remembering, that she killed Mireille's parents years before, Kirika seems to finally accept her fate that she is the true Noir, along with Chloe, and accompanies her to the Manor where the mysterious Altena is trying to purify the Soldats and bring them back to their original purpose. She seems to think that reviving Noir will have a rejuvenating effect on the Soldats, who she sees as having strayed from their original purpose of protecting the weak and oppressed. Ironically, the Soldats are now the tyrants of the world.

Meanwhile, Mireille, who also was a candidate for Noir, tries to get on with her life without Kirika. She is contacted by another faction of the Soldats. A faction that is against Altena. They want her to throw a wrench in the system. They want her to become half of Noir by killing one of the other two girls and becoming their agent, and maybe kill Altena in the mix. So Mireille, wanting to finally rid herself of the past, and also, in part because she cares for Kirika, also travels to the Manor. Who knows who will be standing at the end of Volume 7? You'll just have to buy and watch!

Well, I know it's a bad joke, but the series does end on quite a bang. Actually, this volume was a little slow-moving. I especially thought the character of Chloe was not allowed to develop much from a bloodthirsty grinning killer. Kirika really shined in the last couple of volumes. As always, the action sequences are very fine, with the usual shooting Noir theme playing in the background. Highly recommended.",1090972800,8,1825,4.609230769230769
7998297,5,B0000C9JET,This is a very good series. I just picked this up in at fye and wasn't disaponeted. Theres not bad dubbing in this series eather. This has very good animation and a ok storyline but its kinda of weak but cool. You get the choice of Japanese and english lang. eps 24-26.,1074816000,2,269,4.1923076923076925
7998298,5,B0000C9JET,"I really liked this series. The underling story line develops an unstoppable momentum as we move from chapter to chapter. By ""Then End of the Matter"" the viewer can hardly wait to get his hands on the next DVD to learn who will survive to become the ""True Noir.""
What I especially liked was the lethality of the players, unlike alot of Sci Fi, great rivers of firepower are not on display. Instead each shot fired is potentially lethal, and the tension in the movies of Sergio Leone is recaptured. Also like Sergio, extreme close-up's on the character's eyes, and facial features are often used to build the tension. The artists come through beautifully in terms of rendering  what must have been a challenging vision on the part of the director.
I'm in my 40's myself, and have no problem recommending this series to an adult audience. The story telling is that good, far beyond the level of most ""Prime Time"" offerings in the states.",1071100800,4,935,4.666666666666667
7998299,5,B0000C9JET,"""Noir, it is the name of an ancient fate, two maidens who govern death, the peace of the newly-born, their black hands protect.""
Noir was one of the greatest anime series I have ever seen. The animation is wonderful and is used to really illustrate the mood and scene. The show is also one of the most depressing series I have ever seen. The end has some hints of a happy end but it is just overshadowed by all the has happened in the seires. The end poses the question, "" If love can kill, can not hatred save?"" This question is the main focal point of the end of the series. The series may end with the vision of a brighter tomarrow, but it is easily looked over by all the prior events. All in all the series is very depressing, but so are the end to a lot of the shows that I watch. The end, as well as the entire series, may be depressing, but it is just an excellent show and is one of my personal favorites.",1069113600,3,914,4.05524861878453
7998300,5,B0000C9JET,"When a series is progressing predictably, one of the things a director must struggle with is finding new ways to bring about a satisfactory conclusion.  We have known all along that a strong inner conflict was developing between the three 'saplings of the Soldats - Kirika, Mirielle, and Chloe.  Nor is it any surprise that it would come to a head violently.  Yet withing this thematic architecture there is quite a lot of room for plot manipulations and character development, and director Kouichi Mashimo seizes the opportunity to leave not stone unturned.
Kirika has returned to the spiritual home of the Soldats, coupled with Chloe for the final rituals that will refine them into Noir, the deadly assassin sisterhood of the Soldats,  Cloaked as if they were nuns, Altena and her consorts prepare the final tests.  The goal in hand is the return of the Soldats to their original character as truthseekers who follow the deadliest path.  Altena's opponents are the new Soldats, who prefer the status quo of ruling a vast financial empire.  The conflicts are inevitable, and all revolve about the three women.
Almost as an afterthought Mirielle, who was left behind at the end of the last DVD, reappears.  But this is no afterthought, but the completion of the circle.  Only two can survive the tests, the other must die as a sacrifice.  Will it be Kirika, who has come to be repelled by what she has done.  Or Chloe, who suddenly shows a  surprisingly delicate human side, couched in the frame of the deadliest of killers.  Or perhaps the victim will be Mirielle, abandoned by the Soldats, left behind by Kirika, and fiercely loyal to her truest friend.
The theme for these last episodes is 'if love can kill then hate can save,' a question which receives many answers.  Even at the end, we are left to answer this for ourselves.  The series reaches a point where an exquisitely open-ended conclusion is possible and the last dialog leaves the viewer wondering, with Kirika, ""What are we going to do now?""  And the only answer is ""Go back to Paris and have a hot cup of tea.'",1068508800,5,2078,4.730555555555555
7998301,5,B0000C9JET,"What a remarkable series this was!  As far as I am concerned, this is one of the finest anime series ever produced. The voice talent, the music, the stories were all well crafted and heck of a lot fun to watch.
Noir is a female centric anime about three beautiful young women placed in various cosmopolitan settings all throughout Europe who make a living; and the world for a better place for that matter, by assassinating very bad men.  With choreographed, John-Woo-like, action scenes, immense details paid to the type of weapons used, a compelling story line, and a wonderful soundtrack, Noir is a true rush to experience.
In the first episode there is a consummation, so to speak, between two female characters hence this may not for suitable for children; you decide. In the last two episodes we witness all three characters, Chloe, Mirelle, and Kurika tear into each other to determine which two are the True Noir and it is very compelling to watch.
My favorite show-stopping scene is in the second episode of this DVD. Its a point blank, in your face, shooting sequence between Murille and Kurika that takes place by a statue. This scene is amazingly animated, directed and edited. Every time I see that scene I replay it just to get the whole nuance. (Watch Kurikas shadow after her first shot at Mirelle.)
I hope we see more for even if a sequel is marginal, the music and the characterizations alone would be worth the time and money.",1067731200,,1445,4.68503937007874
7998302,5,B0000C9JET,"Okay, so now it's the end of Noir.  Sad but true.  Well the end was very nice, emotional and oh man, the music!  I want to music so bad!  And hey wouldn't it be cool to have the music from the watch as a ring tone?  Anyway, there're a couple sad parts, good action and it wraps up pretty well.  The only problem is that I wanted to see an epilogue to the series, like what happened to the characters after everything was over.  I won't say whose alive or dead since I don't want to ruin it.  But watch and find out.  Oh and the little red box on the back of the insert actually makes sense if you've watched the second episode, and it's funny.  Anyway so long!",1067212800,2,660,4.007692307692308
