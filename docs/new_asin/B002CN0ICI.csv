This book is good for young girls around the ages of 4-8. My only concern is that these books are so short! But that's fine,as long as other people like this book.",1474070400,,347,4.421875

8364296,1,B002CN0ICI,"So, this DVD has a professional ballerina and a young girl showing you the dances from some of the Barbie movies.

They do a great job going slow and showing the dances intermixed with the movie to keep my daughters attention.

I only give it 1 star, though, because all the instruction is done on a dance mat, and the dance mat is not only NOT included with the DVD, but I can't find a spot to purchase one anywhere.  Without the mat, it's impossible to fully copy the dancers moves as they reference it constantly.

Great idea that falls way short by depending on a prop that isn't available.",1363910400,7,594,4.372727272727273
