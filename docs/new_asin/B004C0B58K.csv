A lot of it is straight up fighting, which is pretty intense because I know I haven't seen anything like it in a movie before (I tend to watch comedies more often).  I feel like many people reflect on the fact that it doesn't have a huge plot.  I agree that it's not a complicated plot, but there is one.  I feel it's more about human interaction, human choices, and human nature.  If you look at it from that perspective, it's really interesting.  I recently watched this for the second time and found things I hadn't seen the first time through.  Also, the actors play their parts really well.  I found it a really good film.  Hopefully you will, too.",1331942400,2,692,4.428571428571429

4322649,5,B004C0B58K,This was a gift so I can't comment on the actual product. I just wanted to say it came quick and packaged well. I do know it was a hard to find DVD locally so was happy to find it quick and reasonably priced.,1324252800,,208,3.75
4322650,5,B004C0B58K,"after i saw the first one i was thrilled to see zero 2 - but had to wait 2 years (austria)!!!!!

the 2nd is a bit better, funnier, more fights, more blood and more boys!

not only a boy movie! girls will love it too, because of shun oguri, miura haruma, and the others.

miike's movies are great!!!! no doubt about it!",1321920000,,318,4.096774193548387

8422625,5,B004C0B58K,Loved it as much as the first one. Miike-sama never fails to impress.,1414972800,,69,4.384615384615385
8422626,4,B004C0B58K,A nice follow up to the original but the subtitles aren't very good. Inaudible speech that has writing on the screen isn't translated and many works are misspelled and spelled correctly two lines later. Not enough to make me dislike the viewing but enough to stand out as a minor annoyance.,1413504000,2,290,4.705882352941177
8422627,5,B004C0B58K,great movie shipped fast,1405814400,,24,5.25
8422628,5,B004C0B58K,The movie is of very good quality even though it is an obvious burned movie. The cover on the case and dvd are obviously printed. That aside the subtitles and video clarity are great. It was a good deal for the price.,1389571200,,217,4.190476190476191
8422629,2,B004C0B58K,"The video quality was not very good, the color was slightly off and it was blurry on some scenes. Their was a lack of a quality in the dvd menu; it only had ""play"" and ""subtitles."" The subtitles are alright with minor spelling errors. The quality of the overall dvd was bad. I was hugely dissappointed because I spent money on movies that seemed ripped.",1384992000,2,353,4.446153846153846
8422630,5,B004C0B58K,I could not stop watchin this movie when I first bought it. I love everything about it. The fact that Oguri Shun & Haruma Muira are both in this are a bonus to me.,1374278400,2,163,3.823529411764706
8422631,5,B004C0B58K,"Just got it, Popped it in, fell in love with the movie. The acting is so amazing, and I love the hairstyles, OMG",1355961600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8422632,5,B004C0B58K,I loved this movie. Great story and lots of action fighting scenes. I wish there was a blu ray version.,1335052800,3,103,4.2
8422633,5,B004C0B58K,I enjoyed the first Crows and was hoping that the second one would be good. In my opinion it was even better than the first one and the fight scenes were done so well that it was hard not to think they were real. The story was good and it had a few flashbacks to remind you why some things were happening. Miike does it again with Crows 2 as he always seems to impress me.,1334707200,,372,3.9078947368421053
