Also, to get more in-depth analysis of Palestine, Iraq and the rest of the Middle East, there's a grass-roots media project called ""Justice Vision"" that offers DVDs of lectures by people like Noam Chomsky, Robert Fisk and the late (and great) Edward Said.  ""Justice Vision"" offers their DVDs, at cost, and each DVD contains 3 or 4 lectures.  You'll learn more in those 7-8 hours than you will during a semester at most schools.

8047523,3,B0007II14C,"this documentary was done in the 90's but is an accurate portrayal of what palestinians go through. narrated by casey casum which seemed an odd choice to me, as im used to his doing the top 40 music hits sunday morning, the feature is nevertheless a good overview of the situation, though a little older version. i strongly recommend people to view more than just this film to get a good portrait of what the situation is overall in palestine/israel. there is a huge situation going on and it deserves to be investigated by everyone. i have come to recognize cencorship of materials locally, as i was searching for many items relating to this conflict in chain stores locally, and found NONE WERE AVAILABLE. i was told by several people that titles were out of print or not even available for special order. that to me reeks of censorship of the truth, and i was heavily disappointed. thanks to amazon, these are available to be purchased, and i recommend everyone do so, because you will not find them in stores, and the truth should be known. also check out, brothers and others, gaza strip, tragedy in the holy land, jenin jenin, jenin-massacring the truth, i think you will find these titles will help in addtition to this title here.",1108684800,35,1238,4.657534246575342
