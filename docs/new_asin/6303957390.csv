BTW- the marching band song is  ""Am I Wrong?"" by Love Spit Love. It's a very cool song, and it  took me awhile to find it, too.",937872000,,385,4.175675675675675
749561,5,6303957390,"I am a 35-year-old female who absolutely loved this film, proving that although this film centers around a high school Freshman, it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  Most touching are Angus' relationships with his  small, close-knit family, as well as his quirky best friend.  Kudos to the  film's screenwriter(s) who successfully portrayed all of the characters in  a realistic light (read: no two-dimensional villains in this film).  ""Angus""'s original dialogue delivers a super message of  enthusiasm and courage for anyone who has ever had self esteem issues...and  who hasn't...without the typical ""route for the underdog cheesy  ending.""  I plan to use this film in a forum for my staff members, and  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be thoroughly entertained.",921110400,,784,5.142857142857143
749689,4,6303957390,"Angus Bethune (Charlie Talbert) is an overweight teenager with a crush on Melissa Lefevre (Ariana Richards), a pretty cheerleader at his school. Since he was in grade school he has been bullied by Rick Sandford (James Van Der Beek) the good looking kid that can do no wrong in the eyes of pretty much everyone. And if things couldn't be worse, Melissa is Rick's girlfriend.

This inspirational movie with lots of great lines and lessons is narrated by Angus who we quickly follow from grade school to present day as he copes with his weight by being tuff instead of walked over by his peers. He breaks Rick's nose numerous times in an attempt to stand up for himself but Rick keeps getting prettier and Angus becomes more and more frustrated. I not supporting violence as a measure of handling our problems but Angus doesn't let his weight get in the way of the things he wants to do like play football and get into a specialized Science school. By the end of the film he resolves his violent tendencies as a way of coping with confrontation.

Rick's current punishment involves getting Angus voted King of the Winter Ball in an attempt at embarrassing Angus. Angus knows this, but he also sees it as an opportunity to dance with Melissa who is of course the Queen. Now if only he could get a black tux that will fit him and learn to dance.

The talented Kathy Bates has a small role as Meg Bethune, Angus's supportive and loving mother, who had her own kind of torments to live through as a child. Her greatest fear is that Angus will be as scarred as she feels. George C. Scott is his intelligent and wise Grandpa Ivan. He's ""the big kid down the hall"" getting married to a beautiful and much younger woman despite what everyone around him says about it. His motto? ""Screw 'em!""

Angus and his grandfather have a funny nattering relationship that is hilarious. Angus could come across as disrespectful of his grandfather but its part of their relationship and if you look deeper it's obvious they love one another. He receives lots of advice from his grandpa on girls and life although he doesn't necessarily take it immediately into account. When Angus is concerned about being normal he rallies with: I'm big, I'm normal. When Angus threatens to break more noses he counters with: You can't go around beating everyone up 'cause they don't like you. Use what you have in here (points to head).

Even though this film is over ten years old its message is still relevant to plus size teenagers and adults today. Don't give up and don't hide away. There are a lot of embarrassing moments Angus has to live through and the viewer can't help but feel for him and maybe even relate. It's a fun film with a great message for living life and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It even has a lively soundtrack with artists such as Goo Goo Dolls and Green Day. I highly recommend seeing it at least once. Check your local video store or watch for it on your local specialty network. Hopefully someone will release this one in DVD soon. Reviewed by M.E.

749692,5,6303957390,"""Angus"" is a movie about a shy 14 year old who doesn't fit in. He is humiliated and picked on by others at school, and spends most of his time hanging out with his friend, another outsider named Troy, and his grandfather, and dreaming of being with the school's hottest cheerleader, Melissa Lefevre. One day, his dreams come true, somewhat, when he is chosen to dance with Melissa at the Winter Ball. However, the set up was planned by Melissa's boyfriend, and Angus' arch nemesis, Rick Sanford. Angus decides to finally stand up to Rick, and lets him know that he prefers to be different.

""Angus"" is a great film for teens that says it's okay to be different. The acting is great, particularly Charlie Talbert's performance as Angus, and James Van Der Beek as the pain in the butt Rick Sanford. This is one of the most underrated films of all time, and a classic in the teen genre. Unfortunately, it STILL isn't on DVD, BUT according to a recent chat with Warner Home Video, they are the controllers for the video rights for this film.

Take the time to see this movie, then take a stroll to the local Wal*Mart and check out the DVD value bin.

749696,5,6303957390,"I think this is one of the few films that I actually remember being in the theaters to see. Not for the movie specifically, but for the fact that it was pretty emotionally gripping at the time it came out (I was really young when I saw it... and it was my first real exposure to Green Day), and that it made my father cry the first time (and several times there after) during the wedding sequence.

Now, my gripe is, I know for a fact there is an abundance of Special Features for this film, at least in deleted scenes terms. there are several scenes that appear on the Television edit, but, as per the original short story this movie was based upon, the Grandfather wasn't originally in the movie at all; Angus' father (who was homosexual) and his mom (A lesbian truck driver) were the two parental figures, yet for some reason, the studio decided to replace the father (after the film rapped shooting) with the grandfather, and have specific scenes reshot entirely.

So essentially, somewhere out there is an alternate work print with Mr. George C Scott, and we're missing out on what could be a really awesome DVD- maybe a Theatrical/Director's Cut, maybe?",1118016000,2,1159,4.594202898550725

it's very funny the way that angus' awkwardness is portrayed; from him being the only kid at the pep rally in red while everyone else is in blue, dancing with a blow-up doll(it's not as vulgar as it sounds, trust me!) kids running his underwear up the flagpole, and the hideous plum colored tux. this movie also rocks an amazing soundtrack with the goo-goo dolls, weezer, and a great song by green day. check that out too.",1113436800,,678,4.512195121951219

The soundtrack for this movie is also excellent - I used to listen to it all the time before I sat on it. Oh, well. I'll get another one.

749753,5,6303957390,"Angus is real. It is not a movie that seems like it is a movie. It seems real. It is not one of thos teen movies where the dialogue was obviously written by some college dropout who was majoring in Creative writting, and is trying to prove that s/he can write realistic dialogue. The teenage characters don't speak like adults, they speak like kids, and that is how it should be. This is not to say that the dialogue is borish or simplistic. The lines delivered by George C. Scott are real tremendous.

The movie is also extremely well put together. It has a load of foreshadowing and symbolism that I didn't pick up on until I had seen it many times (Angus wears Red to the pep rally when everyone else wheres blue. His experiment consists of a Red dot in a sea of blue.)

This is a really amazing movie that doesn't fade in value as time goes on, it grows richer and richer. One of my favorite movies of all time.

And to chime in with the crowd, it is really horrible that they havn't come out with a DVD for this yet. Special Features would be awesome, but just a simple DVD would make me just as happy.",1104710400,3,1107,4.212264150943396

It encourages and reinforces that being popular isn't everything, and in fact, in the end, it's nothing.  Angus is is fat, and his best friend is a goof-ball.  But, he stands up for what is right, defends those he cares for and has the strength to follow his own path.  And in the end, the girl realizes that, although he's no handsome football star, he is kind and intelligent and funny.  Angus is an inspiration for those who have been slighted and made fun of because of our looks, or lack thereof.  It teaches good values, loyalty to friends and perserverance.

749857,5,6303957390,"In general, the best of films evoke many emotions.  However, can a film actually be life-chaging, or perhaps even life-saving?

I remember hearing about this film when it first came out in theatres. It never occured to me that I should see this; I was a 14-year-old who was just starting high school. In that manner, the opportunity passed up. I wouldn't think of the film for another six years, until a reccomendation at this website rekindled my interest. I rented it, saw it, and was blown over. Angus Bethune, good at science and at fooball, is the punch line of school jokes. Rick Sanford, American can-do-ism at its worst. I thought I was seeing myself in that film, in the character of Angus Bethune.  Yet, I didn't have weight problems, attitude, or bullies like he did.  Why then did I sympathize?

Indeed, Angus is not like the other glut of teen films that came out well after it. In fact, one could argue it's the perfect anti-teen-film. It doesn't resort to superficial conventions nor does it go for the underlying cynicism. It takes the issues of alienation, loneliness, determination, and the need for direction in a world full of ideas and ideologies with heart, wit, humor, and accessibility.

Patrick Read Johnson (who did a marvelous job directing this film) did the right thing to deviate from the teen film construct and focus on the character-driven narrative. In an interview I read, he explained that teens were not pleased with this film, but older audiences enjoyed it.  He then gives the reason:  Teens want to be entertained; they don't want to be EXPOSED.

Many non-teens who have seen this film would concur. They remember those tumultuous, confusing times in high school, where they felt alone and ashamed.  This film was a testament of those feelings. The director himself was approached by teachers that have used the film to describe these tribulations and the importance of understanding each other, in light of these times where ""high-school-shootouts"" are all the fashion. Several films present Columbine-like events; could Angus have prevented it all-together? Who knows.

I don't think I'll ever see another film that's this moving. Perhaps after time to reflect, we'll appreciate this film as a revelation of courage and hope.

EDIT:  Why is there no DVD?  This film should not be disposed of along with the increasingly forgotten VHS format.  A DVD for this great film is a must!",1013126400,6,2421,4.8995098039215685

It is a terrific movie for young teenagers going through  Jr. High & High school.  It's just really great, I can't think of how  to put it!",946771200,,298,3.725806451612903

ITS NOT THE DESTINATION BUT THE ROUTE TAKEN. I ENJOYED CATHY BATES IN THIS MOVIE,  AND I'M NOT A BIG CATHY BATES FAN AS FOR GEORGE C. SCOTT HE IS STRONG IN  ANY ROLL HE HAS TAKEN ON. EVEN THOUGH IT IS A CLASSIC UNDERDOG MOVIE. THIS  MOVIE HAS FEELING FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY RATHER THAN JUST THE MAIN CHARACTER  ANGUS.  ITS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T HAVE HIGH ACTION OR A TRICKY ENDING, BUT  YOU'LL WALK AWAY HAPPY AND SATISFIED.

I love this movie, and bought it and it's soundtrack ( which is the best ever ). I don't usually go for the movies that blend  unbelieveability with teenagers, they mostly stink, but this one grabbed me,  and i now love it. Buy it and the soundtrack, NOW!

I hope someday someone will release it on DVD with the deleted scenes. I only saw them on TBS once, but the one deleted scene was cool.",1442707200,,233,4.2
7857997,5,6303957390,Angus is one of those movies that's about high school and only having one friend and it's also about how he can't get the girl of his dreams but most important it's about family it stars Kathy Bates as his mom and plus i don't want to spoil to much of the movie if you didn't see it it's got a good soundtrack to it i have it i got it when it just came to theaters but i didn't get the chance to see in a theater but the movie is good and heartwarming.,1405036800,,452,3.768421052631579

Instead of relying on gross-out humor or painfully awkward situations that are beyond ridiculous the strength of this movie is how real the characters, situations and interactions are.  If you want to see growing pains, comedy, heart and strength of character done right this movie is for you.  I don't know how this movie got lost in the shuffle in the mid-90s, but everyone should see it.",1295740800,,491,4.809523809523809

First- the movie is real. It's laugh out loud funny and break your heart sad. I don't think it's possible to not relate to this movie somehow.

The soundtrack is amazing. Weezer's ""You Gave Your Love to Me Softly"" stays high on the most played list on my ipod.

Buy the movie in whatever format you can find - even if you have to hang on to your VCR until some executive decides to make this movie available to people living beyond 1995. I think when our generation looks back at movies from our past, this will become our ""Sixteen Candles"". Seriously.",1245456000,,756,4.347517730496454

I love the movie and the music as well so definitely i already own the soundtrack CD but why is the movie not released on DVD? Based on the other reviews here, i found out that Angus has a lot of fans and i'm sure everyone are waiting eagerly to buy the movie on DVD. For years i've been checking Amazon.com for the DVD release of Angus and also Woodstock 94. I really hope that New Line Home Entertainment knows about the demands for this wonderful and truly memorable movie. My DVD collection always seem to be incomplete without this movie. I'll be among the earliest customers to purchase the DVD if it will ever be available soon.",1238976000,,822,4.675862068965517
