2561269,5,B000FDEVAC,"Kellie Martin fans will love this warm and fun series of mystery films. ""Snapshot"" is a good entry with just the right balance of whimsy and murder. While they are a bit pedestrian, the look and setting of the series and a great cast make for an enjoyable time.

Samantha Kinsey (Kellie Martin) owns the Mystery Woman Book Store and seems to always get involved in some very real mayhem, much to the chagrin of Chief Connors (Casey Sander), who would rather not have her nosing around his cases. When her friend Barbara (Patty McCormick) claims to have been swindled out of half her brother's fortune upon his death, then is shot down while entering her home, Chief Connors thinks it was just a burglery gone bad.

Samantha, however, has other ideas, and with the help of her mysterious pal Philby (Clarance Williams III) sets out to discover why her friend was killed. A roll of film Barbara entrusted to Samantha with a picture of her brother's vintage Bently may hold the clue. Philby's mysterious past comes in handy, as does her other pal, Assistant D.A. Casandra (Nina Siemaszko).

Kellie Martin's abundant charm and a nice supporting cast drive this as much as the mystery itself. There is a fun side story and some amusing moments as Philby, for once out of his element, tries to fix some very old pipe problems in the store. George Stanford Brown, familiar to television fans as one of ""The Rookies"" way back when, directs this one quite nicely so that the most is made of what's here.

Created by Michael Sloan and written by Joyce Burditt, it's hard to go wrong with pretty Kellie Martin in the middle of it all. Mystery fans will find this a very pleasant distraction on a Saturday afternoon.",1177286400,13,1704,4.651162790697675
2561270,3,B000FDEVAC,"MYSTERY WOMAN: SNAPSHOT details the murder of one of Samantha Kinsey's book club members.  Barbara Sommers, one of the town's wealthy, has always been a conspiracy junkie, believing in UFOs and coverups.  At the reading of her late brother's will, she finds out that she's left with none of the family company.  Barbara insists that a conspiracy is in play, that she's being robbed of what's hers, and that her brother was murdered.  After leaving a roll of film with Sam that Barbara tells her contains a clue to the murder, Barbara goes home and is murdered.  Sam and Philby, the ex-CIA agent that was her father's friend and who shares her love of doing investigations that aren't quite legal, take up the chase for the murderer.

Kellie Martin (E.R.) stars as Samantha Kinsey.  So far, A&E have made eight MYSTERY WOMAN movies, but not all of them have made it to DVD.  The series was created by Michael Sloan, a staple in the mystery/adventure TV field.  Georg Stanford Brown stars as Philby and even directs this one.

As a mystery, SNAPSHOT was so-so.  There weren't enough suspects and the field narrowed pretty quickly once the initial murder kicked the play off.  Still, Sam and her cronies are endearing characters and it was fun to watch them work.

Some of the usual confrontations with the local police was missing, and the stakes never truly rose above the solution of the murder.  Philby even has his own little mystery to solve while he works on the pipes in the shop, but the solution comes out of left field and the viewer never had a chance at it.

MYSTERY WOMAN: SNAPSHOT is another great little mystery to watch in the casual comfort of home with a fellow sleuth.  Perhaps the mystery will solve too quickly, with even the twists and turns telegraphed, but the characters are fun to watch and still worth the price of admission.",1150761600,20,1850,4.66358024691358

2561281,4,B000FDEVAC,"Kellie Martin plays Sam, who owns a bookstore. She's best friends with the Assistant District Attorney and helps the people of her town solve mysteries.  This series is a little dated - you can tell it was filmed before cell phones and digital cameras came on the scene. But I liked it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.",1405814400,,346,4.40625
2561282,5,B000FDEVAC,Another good entry in the Hallmark Channel's series of Mystery Woman movies. Get it while you can. Only three of the 11 were released to DVD. I would love to see more of them.,1403481600,,175,4.176470588235294

2561286,4,B000FDEVAC,"At least in this entry of the long running series we actually get to see customers come into the bookstore.  No wonder she can't afford to pay a real plumber, she's too busy running around grilling suspects and annoying the witless chief of police.  This time there's two murders to solve, suspects galore.  (Where did a bookstore owner learn to pick locks?)  Sneaking and snooping seems to be the order of the day.  It's quite fun.  Nothing strenuous happens; even the murder of a friend doesn't put Samantha Kinsey (Kellie Martin) off her game.  Love the exchanges between her and the mysterious Georg Stanford Brown who also directed this made for TV movie.  Very agreeable, I'm keeping it to watch again.  Wish they'd release the entire series.",1384992000,,748,4.826771653543307
2561287,5,B000FDEVAC,"Ok this move was a great movie, I am so glad I have it in my Collection! As I could not imagine it without it!",1372809600,,110,3.44
2561288,5,B000FDEVAC,"I really like Kelley Martin and her movies are great entertainment. ""Snapshot"" was fun to watch as are the other two offered by Amazon, but I know there are more than just these three.  Waiting for others . . .",1361836800,,210,4.25

2561290,5,B000FDEVAC,"This mystery movie stars Kellie Martin as Samantha, a bookstore owner who assists her friend after a death in the family. Questions abound, and Samantha figures out that the death wasn't an accident, but murder. If you love a good mystery with great characters and a plot that will keep you guessing than you'll love this movie.",1355702400,,328,4.771929824561403
2561291,3,B000FDEVAC,I am a Kellie Martin fan.the stories develop slowly but seeing Clarence williams III is enjoyable. But enjoyment can only go so far. The plots were juvenile and very easy to figure out. don't waste your money. Amazon has better films to choose from.,1350691200,,249,4.681818181818182
2561292,5,B000FDEVAC,I have bought several DVDs on line through Amazon and the descriptions of the movies are very accurate.  They always arrive quickly and in very good condition.  Only one time did I have to return a movie but that was a simple error of which area the movie could be played in.  The one I received was only for Great Britain but the seller was able to refund my money as soon as I returned the item.  Unfortunately he didn't have another one but I was able to find one on Amazon.  It's great to be able to buy older movies through Amazon and their sellers.,1349568000,,554,4.188679245283019
2561293,3,B000FDEVAC,"The same key characters seen in Mystery Week-end reappear in this second TV movie of the Mystery Woman series. There is the same block-headed cop for comedy relief and also to frustrate the legal efforts of the heroine, who owns a mystery book shop.
As usual, her best friend, the Assistant District Attorney, has to warn her that her illegal ways of obtaining information are not admissible in Court and, most importantly, her shop assistant uses his unknown connections in government to get information anytime needed. In this case a friend was murdered after raising objections  to a Will which she thought to have been falsified. Our heroine sets out to right the injustice after her death (by solving the murder). With no insurmountable difficulties and the help of her assistant she takes the law into her own hands and finds the information needed to break the case ( I think I violate no oath of secrecy by revealing that fact). Along the way, another  completely unrelated problem is resolved as well.
All in all, a pleasant diversion to be taken lightly.",1324771200,,1064,4.84065934065934
2561294,5,B000FDEVAC,"Kelli Martin is a great actress in this series and perfect for the part.
Alot of twists and turns and a interesting conclusion.  I hope you will
make more of her DVD's available.",1275609600,,178,4.393939393939394
2561295,4,B000FDEVAC,"Typical slower paced mystery plotline . Kelly and Clarence are the Odd Couple of MYSTERY and a nice fit . The small moments define these movies as much as thee larger events . Towncop adds comic relief as the strate man gone wrong . MANY specific things are out-of-place : the ""plumbing"" scenes are a joke!! HOWEVER , doesnt ruin the story line . The writer/producers did well in bringing 'feel' of a ""book story"" to screen .  FAST ACTION people just pass on to something else . HOWEVER , I do think anyone looking for ""unwind the day"" entertainment can enjoy the ""bookstore"" snoop and her partner unravel the WHOLE STORY .....",1271635200,,627,4.548672566371682
2561296,5,B000FDEVAC,"I loved this and the other Mystery Woman movies when I first saw them on the Hallmark channel and was thrilled when I saw the dvd. My only disappointment is that Hallmark chose not to release all of the movies in this series. It is hard to find a good mystery movie that isn't full of sex, swearing and blood. This is one to can share with the whole family.",1264809600,2,357,4.114285714285714

2561298,3,B000FDEVAC,"Mystery Woman is a nice series which proves you can have a crime series without people firing rounds of bullets, offensive language, and lewd behavior. It is a tribute to Kellie Martin, whi is known to play strong and wholesome charecters. She is the type of person you would want to bring home to meet the parents and the parents would like her.",1189382400,10,346,4.507936507936508
