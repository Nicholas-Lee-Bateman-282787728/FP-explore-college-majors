8044964,1,B00076MXMU,"This is a trilogy set with a few nice twists for the low rent production addicted crowd (like me). I went for it for the Lurking Fear and Jeffrey Combs, perhaps THE Lovecraft actor based on his role in Reanimator. I had a pleasant ""bonus"" in finding a supporting actress in that piece who bore a more than passing resemblance to Jane Sibbett who was in Reanimator (a nice 80's adaptation of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward). Alas it wasn't Ms. Sibbett and Combs was a supporting actor as well. Bottom line if you like made for TV grade horror and get this cheap enough and just can't live without absolutely every adaptation of everything Lovecraft has a passing nexus with go for it. I thought the accompanying stories were better written and produced but not where I live.",1374624000,,774,4.535714285714286
