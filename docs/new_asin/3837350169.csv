7802270,5,3837350169,"I cannot find any fault with this movie. It is a wonderful adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's Madicken stories. The cast are all absolutely perfect for their roles, and the film is beautifully written, acted and photographed. I had no problem with the dubbing: certainly, the lip movements didn't always match the sound exactly, but you have to expect that when a film is dubbed into another language. The differences were not bad enough to be distracting, and the lines were always spoken and recorded with the utmost clarity.  Others have mentioned the nudity. I can't see that this would be a problem for any sane person. It is just two scenes, taking up a total of maybe two and a half minutes, with the two main girls, 7-8 years old, enjoying themselves in the perfectly natural, exuberant fashion of innocent children, firstly in their bedroom, then later in an outdoor setting with two of their friends.

The only improvement I could suggest would be to provide optional subtitles in English and a few of the other common languages. Without any subtitles, this German-dubbed version of the wonderful movie will be of limited appeal to those who don't understand German. It is preferable, however, to another foreign movie I bought recently, which had subtitles that couldn't be turned off.

With that minor proviso, I would heartily recommend ""Madita"" to all children of all ages, and to anyone who enjoys good story-telling and beautiful images.",1367971200,4,1450,4.958847736625515
7802271,5,3837350169,"The main review for this item pretty much
says it all. However if nudity offends you the prequel Madita und Pim has none. The versions sold by The Book Depository where I got mine through Amazon are recorded in 0 region which means they will also play in the U.S. without special equipment. They will also play in region 2 (Europe etc.)

7802272,5,3837350169,"""Madita"" is a delightful children's period film from a more innocent era, based on Astrid Lindgren's book ""Du ar inte klok, Madicken"", concerning the adventures of a young girl in a quiet Swedish village in the early twentieth century. Like Pollyanna, her compassion and thoughtfulness win friends from the most implacable of enemies, such as the poorer girl who resents Madita's wealth.

Contrary to the previous reviewer's claim, there is nothing wrong with the synching in this film - it has simply been dubbed from Swedish into German for this German-released edition and the German dubbers did not take the trouble to make the dialogue match the lip movements. It is unfortunate that they did not include the original Swedish track as an option (there is no English-language option either, so you'll have to be able to understand German to appreciate the film). It has however been remastered and the visual quality is exquisite.

This film was followed by a sequel, ""Madita und Pim"", which is however a prequel, based presumably on an earlier book in the series, so you might like to view this later film first.

The disc is region 2 and may not play on all players. I was unable to play this disc in my region-locked Blu-ray player but it played in my region-locked DVD player (both region 4), so I guess its ability to play will depend on the individual machine.

The DVD comes in a case that resembles a children's picture book and has an accompanying booklet (in German) about the film. In case you don't understand German, I have provided a translation below:

""Did you know that ...

there was a real-life Madita? Her name was Anne-Marie Ingestrom, but she had the nickname Madita and was Astrid Lindgren's best friend for eighty years. They swore an oath of ""blood-sisterhood"" in school and called each other ""Swift Stag"" (Astrid) and ""Strong Arm"" (Madita).

Astrid Lindgren's little sister Stina is also immortalized in the film? She served as the model for Madita's sister Lisabet.

false teeth were prepared for Jonna Liljendahl (Madita) and Liv Alsterlund (Lisabet) prior to filming? Many children lose their milk teeth around their seventh birthday. And what happened? Liv lost her front teeth during filming and she spent the rest of the film with the 'spare teeth'.

[caption to photo] Director Goran Graffman discusses the next scene with Madita - alias Jonna Liljendahl: the family outing by train.

in the morning the two young actresses Jonna and Liv could hardly wait for the day's filming to begin? No wonder, since they got to wear dresses fit for a princess, had their hair done each day, and got to run around in wild abandon - a little girl's dream.

for filming even the flight schedule of a flight group from Uppsala was altered? They were flying directly over Jorsta gard, the 'Birkenlund' from the film. The film crew managed to convince the crew to temporarily alter their flight route and times. Production chief Sven-Gosta Holst remained in contact with the tower and gave the green light when the scene was in the can.

Cast and Crew

Goran Graffman, a successful actor and director with the Royal Dramatic Theatre of Stockholm, took control of ""Madita"" by request of Astrid Lindgren's favourite director Olle Hellbom. The latter did not wish to take on another film so soon after completion of filming of ""The Brothers Lowenherz"" and therefore was active as producer. Goran Graffman did not remain behind the camera but appears in a small role - as the photographer Backman.

Jonna Liljendahl says today that it was an honour for her to play Madita. After completion of the two ""Madita"" films however she did not remain an actress. Like Inger Nilsson, who played Pippi, people could only ever see her as Madita. Nowadays Jonna Liljendahl is project leader in an advertizing agency and has two children.

Liv Alsterlund plays Madita's little sister Lisabet. She continued as a child actress after the two ""Madita"" films, working in various television series and appearing on stage before doing media studies at Stockholm University.""",1332028800,13,4272,4.9125
