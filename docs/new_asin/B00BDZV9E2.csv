8566823,5,B00BDZV9E2,"The Third Girl From The Left stars Kim Novak and was released in 1973 as a movie of the week. A campy tale about a chorus girl, and her lover. Good support from Tony Curtis. Fans of Kim Novak will like this the most.",1450051200,,216,3.9318181818181817
8566824,5,B00BDZV9E2,"Had to get this as I was one of the dancers in this Movie of the Week. It was actually shot at the old MGM Studios in Culver City. Miriam Nelson choreographed it. We're in several scenes, dance number, rehearsal time and dressing room scene. 3 of us didn't have any lines so we don't have credit. A week of work though and lots of fun ! Kim Novak and Tony Curtis were lovely people ! Glad to have a copy of this !! Campy and fun to watch !",1438646400,4,439,3.888888888888889
