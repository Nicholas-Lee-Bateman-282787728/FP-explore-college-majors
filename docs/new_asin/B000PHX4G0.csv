2822333,4,B000PHX4G0,This DVD is great.  No breaks in between each of the Caillou cartoons which is wonderful.  My kids loved it.,1264982400,2,108,4.35
2822334,5,B000PHX4G0,This is a great movie for Caillou lovers. My daughter stays in front of the TV from start to end. No commercials with puppets or any other anoyance. 100% Recommended!!!,1262304000,4,168,4.633333333333334
2822335,3,B000PHX4G0,"We love Caillou and have seen all the episodes on this DVD on PBS Sprout. My two year old son insists he is four, just so he can do all the things that Caillou does in his show. And, he has learned an amazing amount from how Rocket Ships fly to how to help out around the house.

However BEWARE that the DVD is English only and not in English AND French as listed in the descriptions!  I am VERY disappointed as we get Caillou with our TV subscription, so I ordered this DVD purely to be able to watch it in French. For example, we often play my son's Curious George DVD in French, to help him learn a second language. There is not a menu option for Language nor does it mention French being an option on the cover.",1260403200,16,715,4.0638297872340425
2822336,5,B000PHX4G0,"My son is crazy about the Caillou cartoon.  Decent dvd.  I personally don't care too much for Caillou, but since my son likes it I bought it.  However, there are some great lessons included for small kids.",1259712000,,205,4.486486486486487
2822337,5,B000PHX4G0,This is a great video with various episodes of Caillou.  My child really enjoys it.,1206662400,,83,4.533333333333333
2822338,1,B000PHX4G0,I don't think Caillou is a good role model for kids he is very disobiedent and bratty. Kids already are bratty they have don't need extra help with that. One day I paid attention to the cartoon then I realized that is where my niece is learning this brat behavor,1202688000,5,262,4.26
2822339,2,B000PHX4G0,"I purchased this video because I'm trying to teach my son French and trying to increase his exposure to the language.  The description says the languages are English and French.  Well, there is no French option, so for me, the dvd was a disappointment.",1202688000,5,252,4.704545454545454
2822340,4,B000PHX4G0,"The product that I received from ordering this item does not match the description. There are no puppets on this disk, the description must be a generic one. My daughter did enjoy the episodes though.",1201478400,9,200,4.742857142857143
2822341,5,B000PHX4G0,I purchased this video along with others for my twin 2 year old daughters to bring with them to Disney.  I knew the television down there would not keep them occupied so that I could cook meals.  They watched it over and over again  rotating with their other favorites. If you child loves Cailou they will certain love this video.,1194480000,7,330,4.466666666666667
2822342,5,B000PHX4G0,"My son loves Caillou, this is a nice cd, good chapters, it came fast in the mail, I needed them because we were going on vacation.",1428969600,,130,4.038461538461538
2822343,5,B000PHX4G0,my son love it,1416787200,,14,2.75
2822344,5,B000PHX4G0,"If you've ever watched Caillou over & over, you're familiar with all the episodes...so pretty much these are all repeats with the later ""matured"" Caillou. However, there are NO puppets, which is what I was looking for..yay! There are ads for other DVDs at the start of the DVD but what DVD doesn't have that. The only way to bypass them is fast forward. I'm happy with this purchase & happy my 2 year old will be happy with her favorite show.",1412467200,,442,4.402439024390244
2822345,3,B000PHX4G0,i had these for my 2 year niece.  she loves all of them.she asks to watch caillou as soon as she arrives,1391472000,,104,3.727272727272727
2822346,3,B000PHX4G0,if you have some Caillou already you may own this. I have several of the newer DVD's and this was just a repeat of older episodes. I couldn't find the episode list and bought it and i just wasted $$ i have them all.,1389571200,,215,3.909090909090909
2822347,5,B000PHX4G0,Great for our 2yr old granddaughter. She loves Caillou! Color is clear and bright. Listened to it so much I know the song by heart.,1378771200,,131,4.28
2822348,1,B000PHX4G0,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

These episodes (same as shown on Sprout) show Caillou using good manners, going on fun adventures, and not whining (episodes shown on PBS Kids show a very whiney Caillou & I don't let my daughter watch those).
