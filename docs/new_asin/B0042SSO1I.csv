4251939,5,B0042SSO1I,"This series just gets better and better with every season. The writing, acting,and directing are very good, and the plots for the third season are more exciting. The characters are becoming more caught up in the intrigue of the Arthurian legend. Merlin and Arthur are on the path that will lead to the fulfillment of their destinies. The growing maturity of both characters is a delight and the strong friendship that they have developed now adds to the great plot twists in every episode. The addition of Gwain, Elyan, and Lancelot to the story (as well as the other new regulars) makes this show all the more interesting to watch...I can't wait for season 4!!!",1310342400,23,662,4.765217391304348
4251940,5,B0042SSO1I,"I like the new spin on an old legend. There is good acting, great special effects for a series like this and a good balance during the series between humor, tension and pacing. The development of the relationship between characters has gone well during the first three seasons. If you like a re-start on the Arthur legend with some interesting twists this is a fun series to have.",1309392000,13,380,4.602941176470588
4251941,5,B0042SSO1I,"I found the first 2 seasons on netflix and loved watching them. I was lucky to have found such an entrancing arthur series. I have always been a fan of Boorman's Excalibur and have been disappointed with most shows when held up to the Boorman standard. I did find this series exceeded all my expectations and actually was better than Excalibur in almost all aspects. The only thing that gives Excalibur an ""edge"" is it is a single movie and this Merlin series is more like an ongoing daytime drama. I could see all the aspects of Merlin made into a three movie trilogy and blow away Lord of the Rings, but one can only hope. All SEASONS of MERLIN are available on ITUNES in the USA. You can rent or buy them there. If you plan to rent I suggest watching the first two seasons on netflix. Please give me a positive rating if this helped you, thanks :D

4251942,5,B0042SSO1I,"Season 3 is a lot darker than the previous 2 & we join it when Morgana has been missing for a year & Uther is distraught at her disappearence little knowing what will follow during the series. When she is found wandering in the forest Merlin & Gaius become suspicious at her behaviour & realise that she has become a witch who will use her powers for evil.

The first couple of episodes deal with Morgana trying to send Uther mad using magic with the help of her sister Morgause. As usual there is a comedy element with a goblin inhabiting Gaius's body who then moves around the court moving from one body to another causing mayhem. Merlin is shown what will happen if he does not stop Morgana, & is torn between trying to protect Arthur from all the usual dangers he faces & now the prospect of evil coming from within the castle itself. Morgana turns on Guinevere trying to ruin her relationship with Arthur, which makes Merlin have to use his magic to protect them both from never seeing other again, & for the first time you see the face of Merlin that we know from the legend with a long flowing white beard. You also meet Gwaine for the first time who is a bit wild but useful with a sword in a fight! 'The Fisher King' gives Merlin a phile of water from the Lake of Avalon telling him that he will know when to use it, which becomes apparent at the end of the series. The series finale is absolutely fabulous with the drama of Uther finding out what Morgana has been doing & Arthur trying to protect the kingdom from her. This is also where we see Lancelot again & meet Sir Percival for the first time. You then have the beginning of the legend of Arthur, Excalibur & The Knights of the Round Table.

(It doesn't matter that they've taken their own ""spin"" on the Arthurian tales - don't compare, take it for its own worth.)  The show is very well done. Everything about the show is first rate. Lots of magic and action. Very entertaining. A little pricey for only 13 shows but amazon does run sales.

It's a tv series, so there are some plot gaps, cliche moments, and repetition that I have to ignore or then I wouldn't be able to enjoy the show. Bradley James, Colin Morgan, Angel Coulby, and Anthony Head again are impeccable, while I'm not so sure what is going on with Katie McGrath. She's not a bad actress, but I question the exhaustive use of evil smirks. Could just be a comedic gimmick that an American (well, at least this American) doesn't understand.",1359072000,,623,4.672727272727273

4252058,5,B0042SSO1I,The lump in the throat gets larger. You see more of what truly lies in the heart of Morgana and Uther is no help. The love between the future king- Arthur and a servant girl- Guinevere  is shown more as well as the deceit of Morgana and the wicked plans of her sister- Margos.  Merlin continues to fight evil in secret while becoming more powerful and Arthur shows how he truly might just make a good king. I also enjoyed the forming of the Knights of the Round Table. I can't wait until I receive season four.,1346112000,,510,4.247422680412371

4252061,5,B0042SSO1I,"I must say, with this last season, BBC has finally found their niche with regards to how they plan to do this series. There is finally a decent, long-living plot with plot twists that you know are going to come back to bite. They are finally diving right into the thick of things and I can see much more forward-movement beginning now. They have quit making the series as episodic, like the early episodes of Dr Who, and have created a more intriguing, connected, season, like David Tennant's last season was. I'm so proud of them, and I do hope that this change endures through the remainder of the series.",1344297600,,607,4.527272727272727
4252062,5,B0042SSO1I,"Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.

What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.

Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the ""threat of the week"" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.

Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.

Overall, if you like Harry Potter, definitely check this show out.",1343692800,,1998,4.850439882697947
4252063,5,B0042SSO1I,"Have been following this series on Sci-Fi.  While it is not classic Merlin lore, the stories are great, the acting is excellent and the effects are superb.  I now have all 3 years & look forward to the new tales.",1343347200,,212,4.275
4252064,5,B0042SSO1I,"I was pleased silly by the price and the quick delivery. I highly recommend this source for purchasing DVDs.
The series is fun to watch and the graphics are well done, best wishes to all...",1341619200,,189,4.428571428571429
4252065,4,B0042SSO1I,"I liked seasons 1 & 2 because I am interested in the Merlin/Arthur tales, but I wasn't sold on them because they were definitely NOT in the style of the Once and Future King. Lots of things were changed without good reason and without improving upon the story. A year has passed since I saw those. I have also been to a couple of the spots where they did some filming for season 3 (Ragland Castle & Puzzlewood). I think both of those things helped to prepare me to appreciate season 3 more... and I did.

In the second season, I felt like the writers were playing up the teen idol, sex appeal, bad as* quality of the characters. As a mature person, I didn't see any of them in that light, so that was a complete turn off. This season has more of a grown up, serious, and even dark at times, feel to it. I like that.

I didn't like Bradley James (Arthur) at first, but I find that he's the perfect actor to play this character as he's now being written. His expressions and actions feel genuine. However, I am glad that he has less screen time and Merlin isn't just being shown through his interactions with Arthur.

Katie McGrath (Morgana) is the weak link. I think the writers have made her flat and uninteresting... or at least that is how she's being played. She has the same dumb smirk on throughout season 3. You really have to suspend reality to believe that nobody is on to her switch in loyalties.

Guinevere doesn't have much to do. That's fine with me. She's not that interesting either. The chemistry between her and Arthur is nonexistent.

Colin Morgan (Merlin) has come into his own. His part is richer and his acting is better. You can see the maturity in his character. He is becoming more willful and wise. It makes for a much more interesting story. And since the series is called MERLIN, what could be more appropriate?

So, it's still not the Once and Future King, but it's a fun filled fantasy that all ages can enjoy. It's got magic, dragons, wizards, legends, and good triumphing over evil. I will probably buy this season and will look forward to season 4.",1340496000,,2079,4.415143603133159
4252066,3,B0042SSO1I,"As I mentioned in a review of Starz Camelot series, I've been an Arthur fan since my teen years.  Now on S3, I yearn to enjoy the Merlin series more than I do.  To me, it just seems like a kids' version of the Arthurian legends, with all the hokey faux Old English incantations, CGI monsters, unrealistic scenery, and teenagers playing the important roles.  Several characters in S1, ep 1, had so much heavy & fake makeup on that I almost threw in the towel right then!  Having Merlin himself be a young servant rather than a bearded wizard and Arthur a self-involved youth with a boorish streak is an original concept--but it amused me that they still felt they had to throw in an old geezer (Gaius) to take the place of the elderly sage that the Merlin character usually fills!  With Guinevere also being a servant in this version, that's two key characters they've ""demoted.""  One thing that really bugs me is the way they've plucked names of significant characters from the legends and applied them randomly--sometimes to characters that get killed off in the course of one scene this series--just to get the names in there, I guess.  As for Morgana, Katie McGrath does a decent job with her descent into wickedness until you compare her with Eva Green in Camelot, and, well, there IS no comparison, although, as with the latter series, she is largely the most interesting character.

Uther Pendragon is more involved in his children's lives than in most versions, and I do like the dynamic and the actor who portrays him.  As far as the eps themselves go, I definitely prefer the serious ones over the ""comical"" ones.  The one called ""Changeling"" was embarrassing even to watch!  I don't quite ""get"" the relationship between Merlin and the dragon, or why Merlin let him loose in S2 to wreak havoc on the country.  Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention.

I know this series is wildly popular and has a huge fandom, and that there will be plenty of people who disagree with me, which is fine.  I just wish it was more what I wanted!  As it is, it just doesn't seem fair in the scheme of things that Starz Camelot folded after one season and this one is approaching its fifth!  As it goes on, I find my attention wandering more and more as I watch.  But the great thing about the Arthur legends is that they CAN live in so many forms and variations; I'm likely to keep watching as I do find the series mildly entertaining and I love everything Arthur (except the movie:  ""Excalibur""!), so, ""Merlin,""carry on!",1340323200,4,2517,4.580357142857143
4252067,5,B0042SSO1I,"This is one of the few shows that I cannot stop watching! It's absolutely amazing! The plots are never repetitive. Of course, one can see who lives and who dies at the end of each episode, but along the way, there's always something shocking. The series definitely got a little bit darker, and even better than before! I cannot recommend this TV show enough. Every character is well written. I only wish that it was still shown on NBC. Now I'll have to wait for almost a year until it comes out in the states.",1339977600,,509,4.368421052631579
4252068,5,B0042SSO1I,"I'm really enjoying the direction they're headed with this series. Season three spends a lot of time revealing new depths to each character, and it was time well-spent. Uther's story in particular is taking some interesting turns. We learn more about his past and find him to be so much more complex than the simple tyrant we met at the beginning of Season one. Arthur is forging ahead towards becoming the great king we all know is coming (although there is still plenty of good-natured/immature ribbing going on between him and Merlin!). It's also a treat to see the beginning of the Round Table, as well as the old and new friends that accompany it. My one complaint is that Morgana turns out to be a rather incompetent villain. Oh yes, great ambitious deeds of evil are accomplished, but one gets the feeling that without Morgause, Morgana would have to settle for sitting around glaring at people instead of actually doing anything. Ah well, I guess the poor girl has to learn some time. That aside, it's an excellent season, with great stories, some clever surprises, and of course, more of the epic bromance that is Arthur and Merlin.",1339891200,,1141,4.738693467336684

Watch it to see!,1332892800,,281,4.226415094339623
4252081,5,B0042SSO1I,"A couple of years ago I got Merlin seasons one & two from the library to watch with my boys (now 13 year old).  We quickly became addicted!  It is a great story based on the legends of King Arthur but a totally different and original retelling (it is a legend after all).  In particular Merlin (Colin Morgan) and Arthur (Bradley James) are perfectly cast as are Gaius (Richard Wilson) and Anthony Head (Uther) and indeed all of the other main characters are great along with the special guest actors.  Before season one was over I decided we had to own this compelling series so we could watch it again (and we have).  I ordered them from Amazon and as always the service was excellent.  I used to tell my boys if they got their homework done right away we would have time for an episode of Merlin - it always worked but it was hard to stop watching after just one episode! I loved it as much as the boys did and looked forward to that special time with the boys.  I told my 20 year old daughter about it and she loved it too (and several of her college friends are now watching it).  On Christmas day the 4 of us huddled around my computer and watched the final episode of season 4 online with much excitement and we are eagerly awaiting season 5 which is being filmed right now. Each season gets better as the characters grow and develop, the story gets more intense and the anticipation increases.  It goes without saying that I intend to buy seasons 4 & 5 once they become available on dvd in the US; there are special features in each dvd set which are very interesting and entertaining viewing.  I am from the Uk and know season 4 is already available there but it will not play on our US dvd player being a different format.  I have told several friends about Merlin as it has not had the publicity it deserves in the States (we just found it by chance) - it is a great pity as it is far superior to so many of the tv shows/movies which are suitable for family viewing and it entertains all age groups.  It is a shame that lots of people will miss out on seeing Merlin. We particularly love Colin Morgan and Bradley James and how the relationships have evolved between Merlin/Arthur and Merlin/Gaius. During our visit to the Uk this summer we will be going to the Merlin exhibit at Warwick Castle and we'll get our photo taken with the wax figure of Merlin!! I would describe Merlin as a fantasy adventure which is full of excitement and magic, intrigue, tons of wonderful humour (British spelling!!, magical creatures (which are created by the same guys who worked on Harry Potter) and some very emotional moments too.  As Arthur says in Season one (episode one) ""There's something about you Merlin"" - that really sums it up! There is something truly special about this series - it has captured our hearts!  The soundtrack cd's are excellent too!  Well done to the BBC and thank you for adding season 5 (I read that only 4 seasons were planned but due to its immense popularity they added another season).  It will be hard when it is over - like the sad (but satisfied) feeling you get when you finish a great book!  Note: I just want to add how much I dislike those reviewers who insist on telling the whole plot - it just spoils it for those who have yet to enjoy this great program

Knowing he has a destiny intertwined with Prince Arthur's future while trying to keep his magical talent secret because magic is forbidden by Arthur's father is no easy task for Merlin and makes for some challenging and comical scenes.  Morgana plays more of a part now that she is aware of her magical capabilities, but chooses to use it in more of an evil way.  The characters are great and the acting is very good.  There are episodes that leave you routing for the good side, episodes that add to the mystery and episodes that make you laugh.  I recommend it for older children that aren't afraid of a few mean looking characters.  My teens love it.

I am a huge fan of the Arthurian legends because they are nothing like this life, they take you to a place fraught by similar situations but with very different players with very different powers. Merlin continues the tradition, and its feel good episodes do not disappoint. Unlike Starz' Camelot, Merlin is appropriate for the whole family, there are no gratuitous sex scenes, or intensely violent acts. Your kids can watch this but you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. As an adult I fully endorse this show. I've recommended it to others and they've become hooked as well. Buy one episode off of iTunes if you are a skeptic, it's $2 you won't regret.

Certainly, the story of king Arthur and his knights of the round table have quite a bit of mileage on them, so it's very refreshing to see and hear the story from a youthful point of view. Much like the series of Smallville, where we get to see Clark Kent as a teenager facing the challenges that will help him to grow into the fine man and hero to the people of the earth. The story of Arthur, Merlin, King Uther, Gwendolynn and Morgana depict the romance, the chivalry and the brutality of those times. It provides a means to escape into the story and forget about what's going on all around us in these, our times. I just found out that there will be, according to the internet, a fifth season for Merlin, and I am eagerly awaiting those episodes with much anticipation.",1329868800,,857,4.430379746835443

The idea of a T.V. series based on Arthur and Merlin as ""Young Adults"", and how their friendship began, is fun and interesting.  Over the past three seasons, I think the acting has just gotten better.  I'd recommend this series for anyone who likes the stories and ideas of Camelot.

4252093,4,B0042SSO1I,"Season three of Merlin follows Morgana's further descent into villainy. Merlin struggles to protect Arthur and King Uther from Morgana's evil plans, while trying to keep his magic a secret. From goblins, changlings, and fantastic quests - to the introduction of the knight Gwaine, Merlin is kept busy in his fight against evil and anonymously saving Arthur from countless near-misses.

This 13-episode season is more exciting, suspenseful and action-packed than ever. As Merlin continues to mature and grow in his powers, his relationship with Arthur only grows stronger as well. The highlight of the season is certainly Morgana and her sudden turn to evil and revenge. The beautiful sorceress gains power quickly and soon becomes a formidable foe. Fantastic characters, exciting monsters, magic, and romance make Merlin one of the best reimaginings of the Arthurian legend. With plenty of humor, heart, and adventure - fantasy fans won't want to miss this incredible season.

This season is stock full of interesting twists and turns while still keeping it light and playful. We see Arthur and Gwen's relationship blossom into a more realistic and heartwarming love. We get to see Merlin and Arthur have even more bro-mance moments. We still get those heart-touching moments between Gaius and Merlin. We meet some great new characters that provide comic relief as well as interesting new plot twists. We even get some great laughs (the episode with the goblin is hilarious...). We also see a much darker side to Camelot, which is the continual thread throughout the season. My only qualm with this series is Morgana's portrayal - my friend and I counted the evil smirks throughout the season and there are just too many of them. The series begins and ends with some of the best episodes, and it's definitely a show that is continuing to grow and blossom - and I can't wait to see what's in store for the rest of Season 4 as well as the bonus features that will be on the DVD!

This is definitely a show you want to check out with your family and friends. It watches almost like a movie at times, and even though I've seen the seasons multiple times, I still love watching them again (and getting new friends hooked on them!).

In this case, ""Merlin"" is based on the evolution of its four main characters: Merlin (Colin Morgan) as he grows from inexperienced youth to wise mentor, Arthur (Bradley James), who progresses from prattish prince to noble king, Morgana (Katie McGrath), whose fall into darkness provides the show's most tragic arc, and Guinevere (Angel Coulby), a young servant girl who will one day be Queen of Camelot.

Rounding out the cast is Anthony Head as King Uther, an uncompromising ruler whose persecution of magic provides the main conflict of the show (for Merlin must keep his innate powers a secret at all costs) and Richard Wilson as Gaius the court physician, who lends support and advice to Merlin. It is these characters and the range of complex relationships they share, whether familial, romantic or antagonistic, that make the show so appealing. The entire cast is immensely talented, share amazing chemistry with one another, and are backed up by reoccurring guest-stars as other familiar characters from legend: Emilia Fox as Morgause, Santiago Cabrera as Lancelot, and John Hurt as the voice of the Great Dragon. With beautiful visuals and surprisingly good special effects, ""Merlin"" is suited for a family audience. There's nothing here that's too traumatizing for young viewers, though it does get darker as the series goes on.

SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Nothing too drastic, more character-related than plot-related, and most of it pertaining to the first two episodes.

The third series picks up a year after the season two finale, during which the main cast has been diligently searching the kingdom for Morgana. Spirited away at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/series-two/dp/B003ES5JII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">series two</a>&nbsp;by her half-sister Morgause, only Merlin knows the true reason for her disappearance and his culpability in it (it's a bit of a long story, and obviously you'll want to watch the first two series before jumping headfirst into the third one). Arthur and Merlin are searching for her in enemy territory when a familiar figure stumbles out of the mist: Morgana! She is whisked back to Camelot, much to the joy of her foster-father Uther, but Merlin is not so sure she can be trusted. As an army marches upon Camelot at the behest of Morgause, it becomes apparent that there is a traitor within the walls of Camelot, a discovery that sets up the arc of the entire season.

With thirteen episodes in all, season three of ""Merlin"" is a bit of a mixed bag - mostly good, but with a few missed opportunities that prevent it from being truly exceptional entertainment. But first, the good stuff. The series opener and finale (""The Tears of Uther Pendragon"" and ""The Coming of Arthur"") are both two-parters, and are the best that the show has ever been. These four episodes are filmic in terms of the storytelling, visual effects and emotional punch on display. We get our clearest glimpse yet of the future that it to come, what with the reappearance of Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake, the introduction of the Round Table Knights, and that glorious final shot of...well, I'd better not give it away. It's wonderful, stirring stuff.

Between our four young actors a great dynamic is at work. Arthur and Guinevere's love story begins to develop from puppy love into something more serious, and if you thought that the pairing was a little rushed in the second series, give it another chance. Here the writers allow the couple to flirt and laugh and enjoy each other's company, and as a result Bradley and Angel's chemistry feels much more natural. Meanwhile, Colin and Katie channel a very different kind of chemistry as former-friends Merlin and Morgana draw their line in the sand and find themselves on opposite sides. Their scenes together are nothing short of electrifying as Morgana strives to bring down the Pendragons and Merlin attempts to oppose her at every turn whilst protecting his own secret.

Among the new characters that are introduced this season are the future Knights of the Round Table, providing heroics and eye-candy in equal measure. There are also some great episodes such as ""The Crystal Cave"" and ""The Eye of the Phoenix"" which do a great job of melding elements of Arthurian legend with the show's own vision.

But...there's a downside. To my mind at least, there are two major problems at work in season three that prevent it from getting a five-star rating.

The biggest disappointment of season three is what was meant to be its trump-card: Morgana. A prequel's success lies in the journey that characters take to predetermined destinations. We all KNOW where Merlin, Morgana, Arthur and Guinevere end up. What we're interested in is HOW they get to those places, and Morgana's fall from a spoilt but essentially good-hearted young woman to the evil enchantress of legend undoubtedly held the most potential for a dramatic character-arc.

Morgana had been established as a brave, impulsive, passionate woman who was frightened by her growing powers and terrified of Uther's hatred of magic despite his love for her. We had seen for ourselves how dangerous she could be when crossed and how gifted she was with the art of manipulation. Hers was a personality that could quite easily be corrupted by fear and hatred, whilst still remaining sympathetic and defensible given her circumstances - after all, Morgana's main goal is to destroy a genocidal tyrant. For any writer, this set-up would be considered pure gold.

And so it is a bitter disappointment to discover that the Morgana who returns to Camelot is not a dangerous and intelligent adversary with justifiable goals, divided loyalties and complex motivation, but rather nothing more than a petty caricature of evil. Her plans are illogical and convoluted, and thus fail without exception. She turns on Arthur and Guinevere without hesitation or remorse, taking sadistic pleasure in tormenting them for no apparent reason. There is a perpetual smirk on her face that nobody ever seems to notice. Despite the terrifying prospect of a traitor within the walls of Camelot, she poses no viable threat whatsoever and is continually thwarted by Merlin with almost laughable ease.

Katie McGrath plays the part with relish, but for reasons best known to them, the writers took their most fascinating character and turned her into their most one-dimensional, void of any kind of sympathy, reason, or consistency. Not only has Morgana's past nuance been obliterated, but the events that could have explained this shift in personality took place entirely OFF SCREEN in the missing year between series two and three. It's a baffling creative decision, especially when one considers how fascinating her character-arc could have been.

The other big disappointment of season three is the writer's steadfast refusal to move their plots forward. Much of the season is simply filler, and the stalling tactics are enough to wear the patience of any viewer. Every time there seems to be some sort of forward momentum in the story-arc, the writers veer off into irrelevant side-plots, skipping over what could have been fascinating material in favor of comedic farce, recycled plotlines, and one-shot guest stars. This has the added consequence of making the characters seem remarkably stupid, as they fail to follow up on leads or to ask questions that would have pushed the stories forward into new and interesting territory. For instance, it's ridiculous that neither Morgana nor Morgause think to question the fact that Merlin was able to escape the magical chains that they bind him with; or that Arthur and Uther wouldn't try to discover the identity of the traitor after the magical sabotage during the siege on Camelot.

Why don't they do these things? Simply because if they did, the writers would be forced to move the story forward into places they (for whatever reason) don't want to go yet. Unfortunately it really achieves nothing except to make their characters seem dense, and waste a lot of good material. Other times ideas are raised only to be ignored - there was a chance to explore Gwen's character further what with the introduction of her brother and her discovery of Morgana's magic, but nothing ever comes of these plot-points.

The status-quo is finally shaken up at the end of the series, but by exorcising all the filler throughout the series, the events of ""The Coming of Arthur"" could have easily been stretched out over five or so episodes. We could have seen more of Morgana's reign, more of Gwen in the role of a spy, more of Uther's suffering, more of Arthur living rough in the woods, gathering his allies, and planning a counter-attack to win back his kingdom, more of Merlin and the future knights training and getting to know one another and working as a team to create La Resistance - you know, all the *interesting* stuff that inexplicably happens off-screen.

Am I being too harsh? Maybe. ""Merlin"" has never pretended to be anything but fun and frivolous family entertainment, and in that it does the job. But so often it misses out on being something very brave and different, held back by the writers' (or producers') reluctance to give up the pointless standalone episodes in favor of a larger, more complex arc in which their characters can behave logically and develop naturally. With season four due to start very soon, I'm hoping that the show is finally ready to grow up and realize its potential.",1316822400,3,9881,5.116553006819591

She turns on Arthur and Guinevere without hesitation or remorse, taking sadistic pleasure in tormenting them for no apparent reason. There is a perpetual smirk on her face that nobody ever seems to notice. Despite the terrifying prospect of a traitor within the walls of Camelot, she poses no viable threat whatsoever and is continually thwarted by Merlin with almost laughable ease.

Katie McGrath plays the part with relish, but for reasons best known to them, the writers took their most fascinating character and turned her into their most one-dimensional, void of any kind of sympathy, reason, or consistency. Not only has Morgana's past nuance been obliterated, but the events that could have explained this shift in personality took place entirely OFF SCREEN in the missing year between series two and three. It's a baffling creative decision, especially when one considers how fascinating her character-arc could have been.

The other big disappointment of season three is the writer's steadfast refusal to move their plots forward. Much of the season is simply filler, and the stalling tactics are enough to wear the patience of any viewer. Every time there seems to be some sort of forward momentum in the story-arc, the writers veer off into irrelevant side-plots, skipping over what could have been fascinating material in favor of comedic farce, recycled plotlines, and one-shot guest stars. This has the added consequence of making the characters seem remarkably stupid, as they fail to follow up on leads or to ask questions that would have pushed the stories forward into new and interesting territory. For instance, it's ridiculous that neither Morgana nor Morgause think to question the fact that Merlin was able to escape the magical chains that they bind him with; or that Arthur and Uther wouldn't try to discover the identity of the traitor after the magical sabotage during the siege on Camelot.

Why don't they do these things? Simply because if they did, the writers would be forced to move the story forward into places they (for whatever reason) don't want to go yet. Unfortunately it really achieves nothing except to make their characters seem dense, and waste a lot of good material.  Other times ideas are raised only to be ignored - there was a chance to explore Gwen's character further what with the introduction of her brother and her discovery of Morgana's magic, but nothing ever comes of these plot-points.

The status-quo is finally shaken up at the end of the series, but by exorcising all the filler throughout the series, the events of ""The Coming of Arthur"" could have easily been stretched out over five or so episodes. We could have seen more of Morgana's reign, more of Gwen in the role of a spy, more of Uther's suffering, more of Arthur living rough in the woods, gathering his allies, and planning a counter-attack to win back his kingdom, more of Merlin and the future knights training and getting to know one another and working as a team to create La Resistance - you know, all the *interesting* stuff that inexplicably happens off-screen.

Am I being too harsh? Maybe. ""Merlin"" has never pretended to be anything but fun and frivolous family entertainment, and in that it does the job. But so often it misses out on being something very brave and different, held back by the writers' (or producers') reluctance to give up the pointless standalone episodes in favor of a larger, more complex arc in which their characters can behave logically and develop naturally. With season four due to start very soon, I'm hoping that the show is finally ready to grow up and realize its potential.",1316649600,29,9882,5.116553006819591
