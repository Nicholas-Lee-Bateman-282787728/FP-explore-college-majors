7830396,5,6302741424,It's a great tape to learn basic steps.  Donald is his charming self  and his partner is very down to earth. I was not intimated by this program.  Great tape for folks who remember Donald O'Connor,1507248000,,196,4.388888888888889
7830397,5,6302741424,"If you love to dance or you just love Donald O'Connor,
Here is  a great tape to own.
Not only does it give you the basics  but it also gives you a
chance to see one of the greatest tap dancers of all times.
A must for your collection.",1234137600,5,234,3.7551020408163267
7830398,4,6302741424,"This video is great for a beginner, and very amusing for a Donald O'Connor fan.  Especially amusing bit with Debbie Reynolds when they allude to their interactions with Gene Kelly during Singin' in the Rain.  Debbie Reynolds also does some very funny impressions (but not of Gene Kelly- haha).  Mr. Donald shows off occasionally, but lets his lady co-host do most of the teaching.  Still lots of fun.",1165276800,4,400,4.838235294117647
7830399,5,6302741424,This is such a fun video!  Great exercise and easy to understand.  Donald O'Connor is so personable that it's fun to just watch him having fun.  It has 4 lessons and they even color code them so that you can fast forward to the one you want.  It's like a blast from the past with video out-takes and his guests.  He has Debbie Reynalds and several others on it.  I got it to learn a basic tap step for a play and I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaing it was.,1071619200,10,465,4.054945054945055
