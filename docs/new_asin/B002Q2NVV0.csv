8377456,4,B002Q2NVV0,"Blu Ray train videos make all other train videos obsolete by comparison.  Railway Productions has a magnificent video of Union Pacific's 3985 Challenger in this DVD.  This is a video I watched for the first time this morning and it is now my favorite steam video.  I will leave it in the Blu Ray player to watch over again on my 50 inch Pioneer Plasma.  So what makes this video so great?

1. The pacing shots are dramatic and some of the best I have ever seen.  This video covers Union Pacific Challenger No. 3985's September 2008 departure from Railfest in North Platte, Nebraska to St. Paul, Minnesota and return to Cheyenne, Wyoming.  The camera remains very steady on the pacing shots and carefully focuses and zooms on the major parts of the locomotive.  Upon leaving North Platte at the start of its journey, the high definition footage shows the locomotive in a gleaming like new condition as it heads east through southern Nebraska.  Upon return from St. Paul, the Challenger starts appearing somewhat weathered and the high definition zoom in the pacing shots documents this transition.

2. The stationary camera shots are carefully staged to capture the beauty of this engine in the communities it passes through.  Old stations are captured and rural country crossings are on display to give the video a scenic quality.  The Challenger is also captured going though Buttermilk Curve in Nebraska and making the Des Moines River crossing in Iowa.  Kearney, North Platte, and Cheyenne are pictured and there is a neat shot of the train traversing the Wyoming and Nebraska state line from US 30.  Missing, though are Grand Island and Omaha.

3. Narration is kept to a minimum - THANK YOU!!!  So leaving narration turned on is not much different than watching this Blu-Ray in the without narration mode.

4. For the most part the videography is first rate but there is one great shot near Fremont, Nebraska, on the return where too much zoom blurs a great scene though much of this scene is captured.

5. The video takes some risks with the night time scenes but by far most of this was shot in daylight hours where the power of high definition makes for fantastic clarity.  There is one dramatic night scene where there is a long view of the Challenger's headlight and you see the tower of smoke and then suddenly the entire locomotive comes into view.

Suggestions for improvement:  Feature Grand Island and Omaha in the run (these are not insignificant locations for Union Pacific); Shots of the Challenger running along the scenic Platte River should be prominent in the program and not played during the credits; Train videos should always feature portions of the rail line that run parallel to rivers.",1323475200,2,2713,4.803879310344827
