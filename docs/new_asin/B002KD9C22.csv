3939943,4,B002KD9C22,"I suspect that viewers will either really like or really dislike this series. As is the case with most Japanese anime, the story is bizarre. It's about a group of women, for the most part, who hunt monsters in a medieval European setting. These monsters are called Yoma. The women hunters are called Claymores. The Claymores have special abilities and traits that derive from the fact that they have some Yoma blood. Using these abilities causes them to run the risk of ""awakening"", i.e. transforming into monsters of extraordinary power. If they do so, or if they violate the rules of the group, they in turn will be hunted, though they might not be easy to kill. The story is quite violent, depicting gushing blood and severed limbs and heads, but it is also a well-told and intriguing one that is unpredictable and depicted in a wonderful graphical style with a great soundtrack. I can't report on the quality of the English voice acting in this series as I very rarely view any anime in its dubbed version. For me, a great part of the magic of the anime medium is how the Japanese voice actors/actresses bring their characters to life and through their skill endow them with individual personalities.",1250899200,18,1204,4.738095238095238

3939961,3,B002KD9C22,"After reading extensive reviews on this blu ray set I finally decided to judge for myself whether it is better than it's dvd counterpart.

The show is really great, dark storyline with good mysterious characters. It is criticized by many due to it's deviation from the manga, which is fine in my opinion as I don't want a movie or tv series to be an exact copy of a book. I decided to mainly rate this on the quality of the blu ray instead of focusing on the storyline, manga differences etc.

What I've heard so many times is how Funimation does dvd upscaling. Sadly, I found this is true with this one. I put my dvds up against this and (sorry no pics) it really isn't different, to say that I am disappointed is an understatement. It really looks almost identical, hazy, slightly blurry, bit washed out picture in the same spots. In the end, SHAME ON YOU Funimation!

Hopefully this will help someone else who is on the fence whether to upgrade or just keep the dvd set.",1492041600,10,973,4.394444444444445
3939962,5,B002KD9C22,"Claymore is a very well made and entertaining anime sourced from an absolutely amazing manga. The mysterious medieval world where the story takes place is familiar but alien enough to keep things interesting. I love the claymores themselves. Each one has particular personality traits, some of which make their job of killing man eating monsters easier and some that make it more difficult. The main character is unusual for a claymore in that she seems more human and caring compared with her sometimes more sadistic comrades. The story of Teresa and Clare is genuinely touching and memorable which is kind of rare in an action anime like this. It has to be said that if you like the anime by all means check out the manga. The artwork is incredible, the pacing allows for better character development, and the depictions of awakened beings are super cool. The DVD set is nice with seperate cases for the discs. Nice artwork throughout along with a decent little insert with production drawings and factoids. Highly recommended.",1491955200,4,1029,4.953757225433526

The only thing I didn't like as much was its all female warriors and that's ok it don't hurt the story. But I would like seeing one or two males in it some how.

3939971,5,B002KD9C22,"- Synopsis: This anime showcases a land plagued by monsters that are hunger-driven by one thing: humans. Fortunately, they have one common enemy. A hybrid of humans mixed with the very same monsters' blood controlled by a mysterious organization that oversee and cast judgment on these warriors. These female warriors move from skirmish to skirmish; delivering fear and death wherever they tread. Regardless of where they go, one thing is certain: death and carnage always is a constant companion.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is reasonably violent. However, if you are a viewer who doesn't like seeing excessive blood or violence in general, it might be wise to avoid this. Fan-service is almost nonexistent in this anime. The story and plot is much too serious for fun and games, it would seem. There is plenty of fight scenes, suspense, and the strong desire to maintain one's humanity in this anime. A trait that is overlooked by the ""normal"" people; who see no differences between these warriors and monsters.

- Analysis: The female warriors typically generate plenty of sympathy from the viewer, since they put their lives on the line for the very people that considers them monsters. I imagine even female characters typically take offense to being compared to the very demonic and monstrous creatures that they hunt. It does address an interesting concern as to whether or not these warriors would be considered humans. At least depending on one's perspective.

It's respectable and admiral of the warrior's resolve to maintain their humanity. Similar to certain animes such as H.O.T.D., many characters choose to die in their human form, rather  than to be slain when their humanity is taken over by their Yoma side. This also emphasizes how much these characters consider themselves as humans. Though they typically don't talk much, perhaps they just want to be accepted by humans.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. It's about 10 hours long and includes 26 episodes on 3 Blu-ray discs. Rated TV-MA for blood and gore, as well as some fan-service.

- Conclusion: This is a violent but interesting anime regarding female warriors that use sheer will-power to hold the monster blood inside them to fight against the very monsters they might one day become. All at the orders of a mysterious organization that collects the rewards from the warriors' efforts. These warriors are constantly accompanied by allies, foes, and death.

3940009,5,B002KD9C22,"This is my favorite anime of all time. I do wish they had continued with at least another 26 episodes after this season, but overall I was left speechless the first time I finished watching this series. The first 5 episodes are like an intro to the main characters and world, the next 5 episodes (approximately) show what happened in the past that helps lay the groundwork for understanding the main character and what is to come. The last handful of episodes are an incredible climax. The battle with Rigaldo was nearly as interesting and entertaining as the last battle with Priscilla, if not possibly more so. I want to know more about the unnamed Creature of the Abyss and also about the top 2 ranking Claymores that were mentioned but never shown. This is one of only 2 anime where I will seriously consider buying the manga to continue or re-explore the story (the other being Bleach). Further the muted colors fit the series perfectly, and whomever was in charge of adding musical elements into certain scenes did a remarkable job both in terms of timing and the style of music. I cannot say enough about this show. The mythos is highly compelling. Also the fact that the ""heroes"" are non sexualized women, and the main male character is in a role you would
normally see a female put in is highly unique. I would give this anime 10 stars if I could. This is a must see for any serious anime fan - I believe most women anime fans would highly appreciate this series - that's why I am giving it as a gift to two ladies this year for Christmas.  Thorne's review claiming that this is extremely overrated is his own opinion - as each review is our own opinions. He is entitled to it, but the claim that you are being mislead by a bunch of hardcore Claymore fans is odd. How does one become a hardcore fan - by loving the anime in the first place. The key to this is to read the verified purchase reviews only, as these are people who either saw and liked Claymore somewhere else and decided to buy it themselves, or people who are paying for something they have never seen before and then writing their review (I don't put much stock into reviews that are not verified purchase reviews).  I think all the positive feedback and comments speak for themselves. I have watched anime since the days of Voltron and G-Force (Gatchaman),  first seen Akira and Vampire Hunter D and Demon City Shinjuku back when they played Anime Films on the Sci-Fi Channel,- watched Crest of the Stars back when there was a ""Tech TV"" (remember that!),  and I own numerous anime series of various  kinds. I am curious what he considers stellar anime if not this. But to each his own and all that, weigh the reviews for yourself, and don't be swayed by the manga/anime critics who come off sounding like self-righteous elitist bungholes. This is anime - they analyze and describe what they perceive to be short comings like they're IV league art critics or something. I throw disregard in their faces just as Jackson Pollock created his art.",1450396800,11,3018,4.540441176470588

3940018,5,B002KD9C22,"This series is well-animated and the the mid evil setting just fits. Having not read the manga before buying this, I just went off the reviews I read on Amazon and decided to buy it. I couldn't recommend this series more: it has action and a mostly female cast, but they treat each woman with respect (no pervy camera angles); there is a depth to their characters (especially Clare, the main character).

In one word, I'd describe this anime as sophisticated. The only drawback is that most of the bad-guy dialogue during battles feels cheesy I.e. ""Stop it!"" or ""Hang on!"" or ""You'll pay for that!"". That was distracting and pulled me out of the show, but most of the writing is well-done and thoughtful.

Plus, the complete series is available. That's way better than buying it in parts. And it comes with a cool booklet with bios of many characters as well as interviews with some of the creators. Totally worth it.",1445990400,2,917,4.619631901840491

3940026,5,B002KD9C22,"Claymore is by far one of my top 5 favorite anime's of all time. I recently discovered this anime on Youtube last year or so and my only regret from discovering this is that I didn't discover it sooner because it really is a gem. It's dark, it's mysterious, it has some nice plot twists in it, and overall; it's one of the best woman powered anime's ever. Not that many anime's now these days demonstrate the woman power in characters, especially; with an anime that's entirely made with female warriors. It's badass!

Claymore is about a group of female warriors called; what else, Claymore's who are half human and half yoma who are demonic creatures. By using their yoma half they are able to track down full-fledged yoma and kill them. The anime has only 26 episodes in it which makes it less then tweeeelve hooooooourrrrs. I usually go on a big rant with an anime that short because to me the standard length for an anime is at least 40+ episodes. However; Claymore is one of those few exceptions because of just how good it is. The Blue-ray is pretty good and I do recommend it if you wanna add this to your collection hence why I went and bought it to add it to my now growing anime collection. If you wanna see some badass females at their finest and don't mind some major blood and gore as well as some creepy dark stuff that Claymore offers. Then I highly suggest you buy this cause it's definietly one for your collection.",1439424000,4,1433,4.428030303030303

My copy seemed to be a bit fuzzy at times. I originally bought the DVD copy, and the first seven episodes were extremely fuzzy. The Blu-ray quality is an improvement, but it's still a tad bit fuzzy. Am I just being extremely picky? Or has anyone else had a problem with fuzzy picture quality? Other than that, it's a great series.",1439251200,,469,4.340909090909091
3940029,5,B002KD9C22,"I don't know why it took me so long to ever write a review on this wonderful series! Claymore is one of the best anime I have ever seen!!! The story is incredible and there is plenty of action too. I can watch this series over and over again, its just that good!

Claymore are female warriors who are half human and half yoma. They were created by a group called the organization to kill yoma. Yoma are humanoid shape-shifters that feed on humans.

It gets better than that cause if a Claymore uses too much of their power and goes over the limit they fully awaken and become a Awakened Being! There power is much greater than a Yoma and they can take on crazy forms.

For some reason this reminds me of Attack on Titans in a way, I think it might be the humanoid part cause they don't get that big!

Claymore on Blu-ray is not good at all. The video quality looks the same as DVD. I don't see no change in quality and that's not good. I wish they could of used a different source or animate the series again in a new way but I know that would probably be to expensive to do.

Well either way Claymore is still a wonderful anime series and should not be missed!!!",1439164800,,1163,4.151111111111111

3940036,3,B002KD9C22,"I'm not really gonna say anything good about Claymore here because I feel like it is being EXTREMELY overpraised. You are being mislead by a bunch of hardcore fans of this show. There is nothing special about Claymore, and in that sense I wouldn't say there's anything especially bad about it either. It's typical shonen with a bad ending in tow. However, there is no fan service. Both in the sense of nudity, and (more disturbingly) gore. I'm not saying it has absolutely no violence, but no where near enough to be listing violence as a reason to buy/watch it. When a human in the show is struck during a fight you see a splash of red, maybe some red drips. It isn't bone crunching or gut-wrenching. And rest assured that in typical shonen fashion every fight will be put on pause for a 5-10 minute dialog. Also in a very cliche' fashion, we have one main character who's a crybaby, and the other that's a robot. Claymore isn't what I would call terrible, but check out reviews of it elsewhere before you buy it. Or even better, watch the first 3 episodes online (nothing really changes throughout the whole show), then decide if you want to buy it or not.",1433980800,5,1158,4.492890995260663

3940065,5,B002KD9C22,"If you've ever found yourself in the mood for an anime that's dark and atmospheric, look no further than Claymore. Unlike some other anime where you have an overall dark plot but comedic relief to break it up, Claymore retains its feel throughout the entirety of the story.

The story takes place in a European-style medieval land where bloodthirsty monsters called Yoma terrorize innocent people; scarier yet is the Yoma's ability to shapeshift into human form. To combat the Yoma, a mysterious organization creates female half-human, half-Yoma hybrids who are referred to by civilians as ""Claymores"" for the swords they wield. While they fight for humanity, they are feared for their half-Yoma nature. Our hero, Clare, is one such Claymore who has a painful past she's trying to put behind her.

The show itself is animated quite fluidly with some great fight scenes throughout. There are some sequences where it seems like the animators cut corners, but by and large, the fight scenes retain a high standard of quality. The only real downside to the show is Racki, a young boy who accompanies our main heroine for a good deal of the series. He's really quite annoying and does little for the plot, but I think the show has a lot more to offer than him and his whiny nature; it can be hard, but I guarantee you'll be able to get used to him. Overall, it's a great show, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.",1422662400,,1406,4.73469387755102

3940073,5,B002KD9C22,"In this world, there are monstrous creatures known as Yoma.  They are always hungry, and their appetite can only be sated by a single taste: that of human flesh.  The only one thing preventing people from noticing them until it it too late is their ability to take human forms, sometimes even the forms and memories of those humans they have eaten.  These forms are so convincing that not even close family of the victims are able to tell the difference in time to save themselves.

Into this world come warriors known as the Claymores, half-Yoma half-human hybrids with the ability to detect a Yoma's presence even in human form.  These individuals, which for some strange reason are all female, are humanity's only hope for survival, but instead of being accepted as saviors, they are resented as abominations.  This series focuses on one such warrior, Clare, as she travels the world, seeking not only to rid the world of the Yoma, but also vengeance for someone she has lost...

Summary aside, this is one of my personal favorite anime/manga works that I have seen.  I have watched the anime almost 6 times, in the subtitled version and the English dub (done by FUNimation, for those wondering), and have read the entirety of the manga.  This box set includes all 26 episodes on 4 disks with both subbed and dubbed versions available.

Also, a slight warning: although the anime is very good at replicating the manga up until around episode 21-22 (one of the names was changed for some reason, and a couple other nitpicks that really don't matter to terribly much), beyond that it uses an alternate ending which isn't nearly as good as the one recently used in the manga.  I recommend that those interested in the true outcome of the final battles read the manga starting at volume 10.  They can be viewed online, but I'm purchasing them from amazon as I write this.",1419897600,,1870,4.7024539877300615

3940107,5,B002KD9C22,"Without giving any spoilers, this is one of the few action anime's that features a female protagonist who is not overly sexualized or a damsel in distress just waiting for her man to come save her. there is a lot of bloody action, much to make the average viewer feel sympathetic to the protagonist, and in the end the series reminds us just what it truly means to be human.",1403395200,,374,4.357142857142857
3940108,3,B002KD9C22,"I love this series, but the case isn't like most Blu-Ray box sets. It doesn't shave the paper slip-cover that some products like the Soul Eater Blu Ray, but instead it has a ""book case"" style DVD box sets usually come in (first kind of box set style). This would be fine if the outer paper case was like that thick almost-cardboard-like material, but instead, we get a HORRIBLY paper-thin case with 2 Blu ray cases inside and an art book.

I might stop complaining here. But it gets more lame. Blu-Ray cases are usually pleasantly thick and solid but these border along on-sale DVD case thickness and feels thinner than it should (it's not a thinpack). The art/paper inserts serving as the cover of each Blu ray thingy looks cheap and like it was printed off an upscale home-printer...but not a real industrial printer. I honestly wouldn't even care if the entire case holding these 2 cases was a real one but it's not :/

I don't usually buy anime, but when I do it's because i want the physical version for my collection. I'm lucky my ""case"" wasn't horribly bent (a small crease), but I still hate even looking at it.

Whyyyyy can't all cases be like soul eaters? A good SOLID case...?",1402876800,,1187,4.511627906976744

This is definitely one that's a keeper to re-watch, and to recommend to others. I loved the premise (no spoilers here), and the main character is someone that you can embrace. The storyline moves along very well, and the graphics were spot on for great anime. It's a great combination of action and story, without too much gratuitous of anything. It was nice that as you moved along, the back story on the characters would fill in.

I just wish this was an anime that last longer than it's original run. I don't own many anime DVDs, much less, BRDs, but this was one I was willing to splurge for.

It's a great watch!",1401580800,,753,4.258741258741258
3940112,5,B002KD9C22,"Okay, so where to begin. I purchased Claymore: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] back in 2012, but I never gave it a review. For anyone who reads the Claymore manga, you will see that for the most part it's true to the manga in everyway, except for the ending, because the show was cancelled before the manga finished (the manga is still ongoing as of now.) That was a little disappointing for me. However, even if you've never read the manga before, Claymore is an exceptional anime. The anime (and manga) is about female warriors named Claymore, who hunt demon like monsters who feed on humans. The Yoma, as they are called, have no threat from the humans, but the Claymore, who not only have to be female, are half human and half Yoma, which puts them at a slight advantage over their Yoma prey. Now I know, female warriors, that has only been done a million times. And it has. But Claymore is different. The females actually have a strong backstory, and it is explained as to why men can't become successful Claymore (though I won't spoil it for you.) The main protagonist, a Claymore named Clare, begins a very dangerous journey to find Priscilla, an evil ex-Claymore who took the life of someone very precious to her (again no spoilers here.) With a human boy Raki who has tagged along as her personal chef, she embarks on a journey of revenge, but discovers somewhere along the road that all is not what it seems within The Organization, the group who rents Claymores to defend the humans.  Although the ending never actually happens the way it's portrayed in the manga (which is still ongoing), I think it ends off in a way that will satisfy everyone. I give it 5 out of 5 stars for having an incredible story, amazing characters, and music that intensifies the whole Claymore experience. I highly recommend Claymore to anyone that loves a good, action filled thriller with touching moments interwoven beautifully!",1400716800,,1918,4.691394658753709

3940123,5,B002KD9C22,"I like to think I'm pretty familiar with any good anime out there. So when I came across this one that I had never heard of I took an interest in it. I watched one episode and I was hooked! The story is about women demon hunters called claymore. The demons are able to take the form of people and then feed on other humans, the claymores have been altered in a way that allows them to have supernatural reflexes and abilities to detect the demons. The characters in this anime are well thought out and you find yourself really caring for them. There is a lot of emotional depth, great storytelling, and intrigue throughout the series. I definitely recommend for anime lovers out there and for anyone interested at getting into watching anime this is a great start.",1393891200,,764,4.503597122302159

3940125,4,B002KD9C22,"This anime is great, and just a standalone, classic genre-blend that deserves better than this.

I won't digress into the story, rather, I'll highlight the Blu-ray set and how it compares to what I saw online (subbed by Eclipse).

There is some noticeable digital banding when there is either too much action, or diffusers like smoke and the Claymore's yoki. This isn't enough to knock off any stars, for the anime is great nonetheless, but it is noticeable and can get annoying if you focus on (looking for) it.

The subs aren't bad; I just wish they were on par with Eclipse's, because these aren't.

Yoki has been changed to Yoma aura, for whatever godawful reason. Certain sentences lose deep meaning with the re-arrangement for ""typical anime"" english dialect. Even nice words like obfuscation are gone from these subs, replaced with simpler, unimpressive words of close equivalence.

All in all, this is worth buying if you love the series, as I do. However, I almost feel as if I would have been better off buying the DVD set instead of the BD set. The sound is ten times better from what I first heard though, and that does improve the animation overall. I just wish subbers would check out fansubs before feeling their oats and thinking they can change connotations so freely.

Minus one star for subs, digital banding, and for giving this a skimpy box with an insert when it deserves more.",1392768000,,1399,4.7366255144032925

3940129,4,B002KD9C22,"Claymore is one of the best anime series of the last 5+ years.  Like all great anime series, it develops a cohesive plot, building up conflict episode to episode with attention to pacing and world building.  While the story quite as developed as say Full Metal Alchemist, it is very meaty, and surpasses most other serials in terms of sustained quality storytelling.
The basic conflict is between the Yoma, mysterious monsters who are a cross between zombies and vampires, and the eponymous Claymores, a society of female knights who take on the Yoma's properties to fight them and protect regular humans.  The existence of the Yoma makes for great mystery that unravels as the show progresses, and their enhanced physical abilities make for many great action sequences.
Overall any fan of anime or fantasy should definitely give this series a go.",1390608000,,847,4.99290780141844

(Got this for Christmas, by the way.)

Anyway, awesome series! No problem at all with the series itself or the quality of anything I received.
I recommend this series to anyone who likes action anime with a bit of drama and a fairly interesting back story. No comedy in this show, like, at all.....so don't get it if you think there'll be any humor in it. I also don't recommend the manga, as it's not quite as entertaining. It goes way too slow.

5 stars on the anime, but 4 stars on the crazy amount of discs required for a Blu-Ray version of a 26-episode anime series.",1388620800,,727,4.338235294117647

Normally manga/anime video's tend to deviate from one another but this anime stayed very true...and then it starts to shift around episode 17 or so. It's not a bad shift but it did feel like it was rushed around the end. Still I enjoyed it and have watched it with friends who like and a few who don't like anime and they thoroughly enjoyed it. If you want a synopsis of the anime then check other places for more in depth information as I'm just giving my two cents here.

3940148,4,B002KD9C22,"Claymore is a very beautifully animated series with some tight action sequences. (When they aren't several episodes long, injected with needless monologues about power levels and special techniques.) The soundtrack is minimalistic and a little weird, but it fits in with the overall atmosphere very well. The show starts off really great with a keen narrative, and unfortunately loses momentum halfway through and never quite gets back into the groove. After the charm and mystery wears off, Claymore starts breaking it's own rules. Which is fine, at first. But after a while, it stops being surprising and cool to being boring and predictable. Many of the characters are either totally annoying or virtually vacant. Clare (the main character) is likable, but there's not much else, apart from a few supporting characters who come and go.

Bottom line: Check this anime out if you're into fantasy and don't mind a lot of really drawn out action sequences and corny monologues. Stick to the first half of the anime for the best experience.",1381363200,,1038,5.0701754385964914

3940159,5,B002KD9C22,"This is possibly one of the best anime ever.
The music is upbeat and fast paced just like the action in this anime. I personally think it probably has the best in track I have heard.
The action is nonstop. The beginning is a bit slow but it only gets better through the series. It is not like that series that's the same amount of blood with ever scene. It faster and more upbeat with ever episode.
Minus the fact the anime leaves off far to soon, I still had to give it  a great rating. I have read all the manga and I tell you it only gets better there. I don't feel they did an absolute horrible job in ending this. It ends at the end of an arc and right before a so many year split in the series. I have seen much worse where they leave the anime in the middle of no where. I hope to see the rest of it come to my television. Overall the ending didn't upset me, and its only because the company ran out of funds, yet I hope for much more.

It's worth ever penny.",1373846400,2,966,3.923469387755102

3940162,5,B002KD9C22,"I received a copy of the first 3 Mangas of Claymore for my birthday. After reading them I became addicted and searched for more in the searies. I came upon this dvd copy of season one and had to try it. As an avid reader, I generally do not enjoy any movies that are baised on literature. In this case, I am proud to say that I am.

Claymore is a mature manga, and is a mature series. So even though it is a ""comic"" or a ""cartoon"" as many of the older generation would say, it not a show I would alow a child or a younger teen watch. It is a series based in the main character killing and slaughtering the evil demons called Yoma.

I have searched for season 2 on dvd, but fear they never made one. :'(",1372982400,,702,3.936619718309859

3940180,5,B002KD9C22,"I've watched a lot of anime before and after this one, but this is the one that got me into manga. There are loose ends in the anime, but that's because it covers less than half of the manga. The DVD itself has english sub and dub options. With a few features like the trailer for the series. Box is sturdy so the discs won't fly around loosely when shipped.

It's a very dark fantasy, but for those who normally like other genres there's no magic, and only really 3 different species.

The anime and manga are the same until episode 24. 24 and 25 sum up the anime but are not like the manga at all.

Definitely recommend for anime enthusiasts and casuals alike.",1366329600,,662,4.28

Claymore has to be one of the better Fantasy type animes to be out in circulation. My big reason for starting this series in the past was that the story revolves around several female warriors and their fierce struggle against yoma (demons).  Then there was the given Fantasy world that is prevalent in Claymore.  When Claymore begins Clare the main female protagonist is trying to discover where a yoma she has been assigned to kill by the organization she works for. In the village Clare is whisphered about as a ""silver-eyed witch"" since people like her who are half human and yoma attain silver eyes and also usually carry huge killer silver swords.

On her assignment she saves a young boy from the village named Raki who despite everything soon brings her a small piece of happiness and raison d' etre (reason for being).  Raki on seeing Clare as a real hero who is willing to fight a yoma quickly follows Clare around and eventually becomes her traveling cook. So it is in this way that we set out into a intrigue cased world full of danger with Claymore.

Claymore delves deeper into Clare's past and her reason for becoming a Claymore. The anime is very well developed overall in plot and world construct which is fascinating though deadly. We also see into the workings  of The Organization to which Clare belongs to that contain some awry experiments through the years. Claymore's animation is very clean cut and full a gray gradient tint to it. Some places when watching in the anime are yes injected with color but on the washed out side for a gloomy and Fantasy theme effect. In terms of anime you're getting a unique and original experience.

The best of Claymore is the generation interconnected relationships and heroism aspect blended which draws out the question of ""what's your reason for being?"". Even if not taken in that serious light Claymore will leave viewers with an obvious sense of having an extraordinary aspect.
