534603,5,6302999642,"Moral of the story? Love occurs in the most unlikely places neither can we help who we fall in love with. Always been a fan of Barbara Eden since I dream of Jeanine days. She does not disappoint in this movie either.
Shop girl who falls in love with society man. Society man who wants a woman who wants his for himself. He lies to her that he married to a sick wife. An affair commences. Society madams all want the hero, so exposes heroine's lies that she is a shopgirl.
heroine finds out the hero is not married and while referring to his wife, its actually his dog.",1397174400,,568,4.220183486238532

534607,5,6302999642,"This movie is one of the few reasons I still hold onto my VHS player.  When I need a lift and a laugh, this is one of my go to movies.  I don't think it will ever be transfered to DVD format...so I guess I just have to hope the tape doesn't break.

534608,1,6302999642,I have had very good luck with items I have ordered on Amazon thru independent dealers - until now.  I ordered this video on 2/15 and as yet have not received it.  I contacted the merchant thru e-mail and haven't heard from them either.  I will hesitate to order from someone else who is not Amazon itself from this time forward.  It's a shame.,1269043200,,344,4.328125

7834400,2,6302999642,"I'm a big Barbara Eden fan, so was excited to find this.  It started out cute and enjoyable, but then partway through the two main characters hopped into bed together--this AFTER Eden's character was led to believe her love interest was already married.  I really hate it when Hollywood ruins good movies with immoral crap like this.  It was completely unnecessary and ruined what was a fun, sweet movie.  Boo.",1453507200,,410,4.814285714285714
