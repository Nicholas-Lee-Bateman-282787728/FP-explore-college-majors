8609572,1,B001IB2ZFI,"This DVD is like a promotional video more than an exercise video: I was hoping to have more than the five minutes worth of exercises at the end after wading through a long lead up of boring testimonials. Horn has followup videos, which might have more actual movement, but after viewing the first and feeling cheated, I don't want to take the bait for what I consider a limited exercise program.

I asked for a refund, which took several weeks before even I heard back from them.. Once I got the UPS return sticker, Amazon refunded quickly after that.

A far better video is Yoga by Anne Pringle Burnell, which is chair exercises for the mind and body and is part of the Stronger Seniors Workout Program. All age groups can benefit from the get-go any of Burnell's videos which offer an excellent demonstration of many more exercise than Horn did with his.",1354924800,5,856,4.588235294117647

I rented this dvd from Netflix, and loved it.  I felt better before the end of the video. My leg pain was gone, and I was so relaxed, I felt like I had a glass of wine.

The movements are very slow, but engage a lot of muscles, and you feel it. I felt like napping afterward.  I suggest using in afternoon or evening if you work.

My entire body responded to the upper body video.  I also rented the lower body, but for my condition, the upper body was more for me.

I bought copies for a friend who works at a hotel front desk, and a relative who had back surgery and cannot do certain movements.

There is about a 3 min reflexology section for your hands that is wonderful. My teen used that after playing hockey.

It really is for everyone. Relieves STRESS!!!!!!",1349740800,2,940,4.230337078651686
8609574,5,B001IB2ZFI,"This is the second DVD in the Michael Horn DVD set, ""Sit and Get Fit."" The first concentrates on upper body exercises
that can be performed while seated; this one includes lower body movements. Each would be of interest for seniors, people
who cannot stand while exercising, or anyone looking for a low-impact, gentle fitness program.
  Please see my review of ""Sit and Get Fit Upper Body."" My mother purchased both these DVDs and enjoys using them regularly; she is eighty years old and finds them very effective and suitable to her needs and recommends them highly.",1293840000,3,567,4.835051546391752
8609575,5,B001IB2ZFI,"My mother was interested in a fitness/exercise video that was suitable for her needs. At eighty years old, she wasn't
too satisfied with many of the ones she sampled, most of which consisted of models in leotards smiling maniacally and
shouting with overenthusiastic glee as they jerked their bodies around to the beat of loud, obnoxious music. Few of these
contained the kind of fitness program she would enjoy repeating on a regular basis.

  She was pleasantly surprised by this DVD, which provides a set of gentle, energizing exercises for the upper body
(a second DVD, sold separately, is also available: ""Sit and Get Fit Lower Body."") Host Michael Horn demonstrates the exercises
and movements clearly and in a relaxed manner, allowing the viewer to follow along easily without strain. He also instructs
viewers how to breathe properly during and in between movements (some fitness DVDs tend to forget this important procedure).
The program is low-impact and effective, without straining the viewer. My mother views this and the Sit and Get Fit Lower Body
DVD on a regular basis, as she finds the routines and pace perfect for her.

  This and the Lower Body DVD make a great set of fitness programs for senior citizens, people who cannot stand up to perform
exercises, or anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with the frenetic gyrating movements featured on many fitness DVDs. (One of
the testimonials included on the DVD is by a one-hundred-year-old lady who enjoys the exercises.) These would be of special interest to visitors of senior centers, residents of nursing homes, people going through physical rehabilitation, or anyone
looking for an energizing, non-strenuous fitness DVD.",1293840000,3,1692,5.134545454545455
