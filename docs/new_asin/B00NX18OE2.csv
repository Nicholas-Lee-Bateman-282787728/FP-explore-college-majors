6684145,5,B00NX18OE2,"While it was sad to see Inspector Lewis Erskine's ""sidekick"" replaced by a different actor, this season, thus far, has not failed to disappoint.  Like all previous seasons, this lives up to its reputation in terms of acting and scripting.  ""The FBI"" stands out as a real classic in law enforcement-related TV series (and any and all TV Series for that matter).  Our family absolutely loves this series (now owning all nine seasons).  I never watched it much, if any as a kid, although it was a contemporary TV series during my childhood.  However, we decide not long after they started releasing this on DVD to take the ""plunge"" and buy it.  After only the first episode of the first season, we were ""hooked.""  It's too bad this did not run longer than nine seasons, as this ranks right up there in quality with ""Gunsmoke"" (also a favorite of ours) in my opinion.  Now that we're on the last season, we're already talking about doing a ""reset"" and watching all nine all over again after we're done with this first round!",1427500800,,1020,4.596685082872928

6684148,5,B00NX18OE2,"Always enjoyed this series but have been holding out for a complete series release in a compact, book shelf friendly box-set, at a bargain, rather than the individual volume releases. Most series ultimately come out in one complete set, like Dark Shadows, for fans who have waited.",1423526400,,281,5.0
6684149,5,B00NX18OE2,"I love this series. The only downside is that I am nearly at the end of it! High quality, although the storylines are somewhat repetitive. If you love 70's Ford, Lincolns and Mercurys then you'll enjoy this. RIP Efrem.",1420848000,4,218,4.615384615384615

6684152,5,B00NX18OE2,"This is the final installment of this great series. The entire set is well worth getting. All of the episodes are full of action, suspense and actors who later became quite famous.  All episodes are in great locations and in color. This was the series which really allowed Efrem to showcase his great talent. He did a great deal of his own stunt work which gave him knee problems later in life.  Efrem had three different sidekicks during the 9 seasons.  The last one was a former San Diego Charger who passed away at a very young age a few years after the series ended. If you love crime drama this is the one that set the stage for all the current shows. Good quality and we'll worth the money.",1416528000,5,696,4.338461538461538

8680891,2,B00NX18OE2,"In hopes for a complete all season release in a boxed set which has not occurred (despite approximately almost two years since the final Season 9 release), I've opted to pull the trigger and begin the expensive acquisition.

Though there is no remastering or cleanup of any kind (to the best of my knowledge although one season shows Dolby mono but not the others best I can tell), the plain film transfers are quite good.  Our Blu-ray/DVD player did a great job on the output presentation with very minimal if any noticeable noise or artifacts even on a 78"" screen where just about every anomaly appears .  The picture format was also set to 16:9 vs 4:3 ratio which also maintained very enjoyable (albeit slightly stretched) watching quality.  Optimally we set our audio receiver to ""Mono"" which is a match for the audio output on these discs.  The audio was not muddy and rather clean but of course it lacked much dimension.  Both the music score and voice could be heard clearly without strain (we have a Denon receiver 5.1 sound).  Additionally I had also performed an additional satisfactory test by playing one DVD (disc 1) on our computer (non Blu-ray) to a 50"" plasma TV screen and it too appeared quite good as well as the audio which was listened to via good quality closed ear (non ear buds) headphones.
Setting the performances and episodes aside (which I would rate between a 3.5 and 5), all things considered, this would get a 5 star on the straight film transfer to digital on Warner Brothers part.  Perhaps for the small ransom they are asking though, surely something else could have been included such as bonus material, interviews, outtakes and so on as with the Quinn Martin ""Invaders"" series where Roy Thinnes has multiple introductions and the unedited pilot was included.  The FBI film transfers show minute bits of dust, scratches and other anomalies only on rare occasion. The color prints held up quite well without any noticeable fading or color degradation overall.  If you have an audio receiver I'd suggest flipping through your sound modes and check out the mono option if it exists.  Overall I would certainly recommend this Season 9 except for the MODS - continue reading.

UPDATE:  The packaging itself is a different story.  Since we all don't play the disc right away I opted after a few days to inspect all the discs and found markings on Disc 6.  Well it gets worse from here.  I ordered Season 8 which of the 6 discs, 3 have circular machine like markings.  Season 4 all seven discs had fine small scratches, two had blotch stains.  Season 3 all but one disc had markings. one was acceptable, the others all had small scratches and or circular markings.  These MOD discs are unacceptable especially at this price.  It's hard to blame the reseller.  Season 3 and 4 I had ordered from deepdiscount.com, a different vendor though they resell here on Amazon also.  It's difficult to buy another FBI disc until WB remedies this issue.  I have written to them with my receipts and evidence of purchase and photos.  They have agreed to replace season 8 and 9.  Awaiting a reply for Season 3 and 4.  I've included a sample image of what you can expect with these discs.  I am confident this is clearly a handling issue at the WB plant where they are burned and packaged.",1470441600,,3301,4.675909878682842

8680896,5,B00NX18OE2,"This was the final season for this classic TV show.  While many shows had pretty much gotten ""tired"" by the time they ended the F.B.I. wasn`t one of them.  The action is fast and furious right from the first episode of the final series right down to the very last episode.  Be sure you get the first 8 seasons of this classic TV show from an era that is now gone forever.",1434931200,2,371,4.125
8680897,5,B00NX18OE2,"My review is more of a question. So please chime in with answers. I put five stars, because I love the series, but I'm wondering if I should buy all nine seasons now (including the season 1-3 in two parts each) or wait in hope that a cheaper complete series box set will come out.
Does anyone know if the production company has any plans to release one?",1434240000,,353,4.205882352941177
