272455,5,6300250164,"This is probably my favorite of Bruce Lee's movies.  It's a shame that his untimely death prevented him from creating a larger body of work. I expect  most people looking at this item are already familiar with his films and  I'm sure other people will provide synopses in their reviews.  So I will just adjust the quality of the disc itself.  In short, it is excellent. The image quality is great and the supplemental materials are very interesting. Shout has done their usual  excellent job. The Shout Select series is one of my favorite ongoing collections.",1497916800,,559,4.770833333333333

272478,4,6300250164,"This is on the new 4K blu-ray release. Picture looks good but I don't see a remarkable improvement from Shout! Factory's previous release. Same goes with sound. Though, the film was originally released in Mandarin, the sound quality is much better in Cantonese (which is Bruce Lee's native language anyway). The case cover art is reversible, showing the original poster art for The Way of the Dragon. Very nice feature.

Still a good buy for Bruce Lee fans!",1489449600,,457,4.858974358974359

272485,4,6300250164,"I saw Way of the Dragon recently on Netflix the terrible English dubbed version.  The story is pretty hokey but seeing Bruce Lee on screen is a real treat.  He had such charisma about him and is fascinating to watch.  The fight scenes are very well done especially since this was in the early 1970s.  The Chinese actress was very pretty as well, but the film steers clear of any real romance scenes and focuses on action over mush.

The film is a little bit slow to start out, it takes awhile before the main story really gets going.  Those that give the film a chance will be rewarded Bruce Lees fighting scenes are incredible and the battle with Chuck Norris is very epic.
There are several fight scenes of Bruce mopping the floor with thugs harassing a Chinese restaurant .  You would think they would get the point and just look for another business to buy out or extort money from.

I loved the part where you see Bruce and Chuck stretch and warmup before the confrontation, very few films actually show the heros stretching and loosening up before a conflict.  It gave off a feeling of authenticity to the movie.  You can tell the final fight scene in the coliseum looks like a sound stage with props intercut between the real coliseum shots in Rome.  But that didn't hurt the film in the least.  The film isn't as good as Enter the Dragon but it is definitely a lot of campy fun.

If Bruce had not died so young he was bound to be as big as Clint Eastwood or any of the western superstars, that is real tragedy.  Bruce oozes charisma onscreen and seemed like a great person.  He could have been the premier action star of his time rivaling big names like Burt Reynolds, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis etc etc.

Overall I would rate the movie a high 4 stars.  I am sure the Chinese subtitled version makes a lot more sense.  It is quiet funny seeing them say Chinese boxing and Chinese Pork as other reviewers have pointed out.  I recommend the movie just don't take things to seriously while watching it makes a really good popcorn movie",1462233600,,2069,4.469333333333333

I was extremely excited after getting this as a present.  I'm quite pleased with this movie.  Bruce Lee has a certain it factor that draws your attention to him every time he's on screen.  Every fight he is involved in is pure entertainment.  This is of course capped off by his legendary showdown with Chuck Norris.  That moment is a memorable one for fans of martial arts movies.  The scene where Bruce Lee used a set of nunchaku against a group of thugs was also a personal favorite of mine.  If you're a Bruce Lee fan this movie is highly recommended.",1436400000,2,627,4.391304347826087

272593,1,6300250164,"Love the movie but unfortunately the copy for sale under Bonzai Media is a bootleg.  According to IMDb, Miramax is the official distributor in the USA.  I ordered this for a library collection and am now out of luck because I can't catalog it and the timetable to return it has expired.  Please know that if you buy this version you are contributing to the DVD black market.  Amazon needs to do a better job at vetting it's Marketplace vendors.

Update:  After contacting Miramax, I found out they are no longer distributing this film.  The sales rep suggested I purchase one of the Bruce Lee boxed sets from a reputable distributor if I wanted a legal copy.  There's another version available as a double-feature from SHOUT!, but there's at least one reviewer who thinks that's also a bootleg.",1410825600,7,794,4.702898550724638

272632,3,6300250164,"This is really the movie that shows you that given more time, it's completely plausible that had Lee lived, he could have become a huge action star in America. A cut above anything other than Enter the Dragon in terms of story, acting from the whole cast, and cinematography. Not brilliant, certainly, but quite interesting as a mix of kung fu cinema and American popcorn action.",1403136000,,379,4.757575757575758

272635,5,6300250164,"More than any other single man, Bruce Lee brought appreciation for martial arts into the consciousness of the West via cinema.  There was intense interest in it for many years after his untimely passing, with the torch probably being carried most visibly by Mr. Norris.  I was a little surprised by how silly this movie was in places, but even those parts were entertaining to me because of the charisma of Lee (you've got to love his insulting dismissal of opponents by merely shaking his head or his finger ""NO"" LOL...).  Thin plot aside, the real reason to watch any Bruce Lee movie is for the action, and this one does not disappoint. More than just a martial artist and movie star, Lee was also a philosopher and all-around fascinating human being (check out the book Bruce Lee - Artist of Life).  He was extraordinarily well physically toned and mentally focused, and as he once said, you should ""be like water"" and adapt to your situation, whatever it may be. His graceful, fluid movements were the result of intense training, but he made it appear totally natural and effortless.

The overall plot has already been discussed elsewhere here, but in the end, the baddies tire of losing every confrontation and resort to flying Chuck Norris to Italy to eliminate the pesky Bruce Lee do-gooder character.  The epic end battle is, appropriately enough, staged at the immortal Roman Colosseum.  It is the highlight of the movie and must be one of the best fight scenes either of them ever did (and I believe the only time Chuck was both the bad guy and was defeated). This is a legendary scene and is the kind that inspired movies and video games of the '80s and beyond. I've always noticed how incredibly rigid Chuck's posture was while fighting, with an upright torso and abdominal muscles that were doubtlessly highly conditioned, although he didn't have the rippling muscle definition of the hyperactive Lee. By contrast, Lee's style of was fluid and graceful, almost catlike, with Norris being more of a pale, hairy ogre of great strength and discipline.

This movie and one of Chuck's earliest and best starring roles in A Force of One (another epic battle, this time vs kick boxing champion Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace"") are the two best places to see Norris as more of a true martial artist fighting another great martial artist rather than just being an actor.  It's a shame to think of the great movies we missed as a result of losing Lee so early....I have to think he would have been in others with Chuck at some point.....",1400371200,4,2534,4.727891156462585

272788,4,6300250164,"Way of the Dragon(1972) was the only film starring and directed by Bruce Lee. Lee played Tong Long, a Chinese guy who travels to Italy to help relatives who run a Chinese restaurant. The US English dub deleted scenes such as a nude scene with Italian starlet Malisa Longo or Tong Long trying to use a toilet! Some prints of the movie are called ""Return of the Dragon"". The film mixes kung fu with slapstick humor. In one scene, a bad guy hits himself with nunchakus! Nora Miao is quite lovely as a Chinese woman living in Italy. Chuck Norris played a martial artist who is hired to challenge Tong Long. The non-Chinese in the film are portrayed as stereotypes and there's some homophobic humor aimed at one of the bad guys! The music score is quite good. It mixes smooth jazz with bombastic Chinese music! The cinematography is really good. You can clearly see Tong Long fight the bad guys. There are many kung fu films that suffer from bad camera work. Way of the Dragon also looks and feels like 1972. Way of the Dragon is a classic left behind by the late Bruce Lee.",1360454400,,1069,4.431472081218274

272791,2,6300250164,"It may have Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris in it - but those are the only bright spots on an otherwise laughable film.

Was this film made by an Italian tourism board? On the way to the restaurant at the heart of the film, they happen to drive past every Roman monument. Furthermore, the film is terribly lit and shot. More than once, the film is out of focus. There are needless zoom-ins and zoom-outs. These film techniques work in fight sequences but not more low-key scenes.

Maybe humour is just lost in translation, but the jokes where Bruce Lee has to go to the toilet (which ceased to be amusing quick) are laughably embarrassing to watch. The pace of the movie is very bad. One of the aforementioned toilet scenes has the girl of the film waiting for Bruce Lee while he's in her bathroom. I also fail to see how any assassin would use a shotgun for taking someone out from afar. The cinematography is also very poor.

Thankfully, the fighting scenes deliver and Bruce Lee is on form. His fight scene with Chuck Norris is the film's highlight, but even that is filled with nonsense. Why, exactly, is there a little cat that the director feels compelled to cut to every 30 seconds? When there is a dramatic zoom-in, zoom-out on Lee and Norris, we get another close-up of the cat, ZOOMING IN AND OUT OF IT! Why?! (And thankfully, Chuck Norris would realize he looks better in a beard, and spare us shots of his hairy shoulders.)

In terms of fighting, Way of the Dragon is a good watch, but so many pointless shots could simply have been, and should have been, cut. I'm almost positive the makers of The Hangover watched this film, as the main henchman could very well be Leslie Chow's cousin. He adds some comedic elements, but apart from him and the fighting scenes, Way of the Dragon isn't even an unravelled patch on Enter The Dragon.",1344729600,,1840,4.483582089552239

272829,5,6300250164,"In Rome, a beautiful Chinese girl inherits a restaurant which soon becomes infested with thugs and hooligans. The local mafia boss wants her to sign over the restaurant to him. Business plummets like a mother. In desperation, she pleads for help from her uncle in China. But, in his stead, her uncle sends Tang Lung, a bumpkin from the Chinese countryside. We see Tang Lung demonstrate his rusticness in metropolitan Rome, and we note the girl's chagrined reaction. She doesn't think he can help her. Boy, is she ever wrong.

As a side bar, let me mention that should you ever frequent this restaurant, don't for the love of Buddha order the Chinese spare ribs. You really won't like it. Anyway, because of all the thuggery, the restaurant has hosted so few customers lately that the staff now has all the time in the world to train in karate, these guys hoping like mad that they could fight off the goons. Tang Lung comes in with his Chinese boxing, and these waiters, with their urban cool, regard him with disdain. Initially. But since Tang Lung is being portrayed by Bruce Lee, can adoration be far behind? No. Tang Lung is soon proving his mastery of the nunchuk and doing that thing where the dragon is whipping its tail as he inflicts his dazzling Chinese boxing on the mafia henchmen. The restaurant staff is soon begging him for martial arts lessons, their white karate keikogi (or 'gi') discarded on the floor.

Tang Lung exhibits his naivete when he orders the mob boss to back off and then expects that to be that. The mob boss, naturally, doesn't back off. His local muscle outmatched by Tang Lung, he contracts elsewhere for better muscle. And, so, enter Colt, the formidable American karate champion. And so now will Tang Lung's Chinese boxing hold up?

Given, there's not that many to pick from, but as seminal as ENTER THE DRAGON was, my Bruce Lee film of choice is this one, RETURN OF THE DRAGON. Three things inform my choice. First, it's refreshingly set in scenic Rome, Italy. For martial arts cinema, this qualifies as exotic locale. It plonks our provincial lead character in curious situations as Eastern and Western cultures clash. This movie also finds Lee at his most humorous (and it's rare that Bruce Lee is humorous on screen), especially during the first half of the film. He smiles a lot in this one. Lastly, we get Bruce's mesmerizing death match with Chuck Norris at the Roman Colosseum (worth the price of admission alone). As far as Bruce's movie antagonists go, I'll take Chuck over beefy Bolo Yeung or that old dude with the metal hand or the guy who killed his teacher.

RETURN OF THE DRAGON (a.k.a. WAY OF THE DRAGON) was written and directed by Bruce Lee himself, and the man knows how to showcase himself and his skills. As ever, the Little Dragon is crazy intense and catlike graceful and so charismatic and, boy, does he ever love to show off his superhumanly toned physique. (And if I had dude's build, I would, too.) This is also the movie in which Bruce amazingly kicks up and shatters the ceiling lamp, a move that had my mouth all agape when I first saw it for the first time. But my favorite part of the film? Probably Bruce's tearing out a tuft of Chuck Norris's chest hair. And then Chuck's reaction to that. Oh, also, the unfortunate Robert Wall surfaces. But he survives Bruce's wrath in this one. Guy ain't so lucky in ENTER THE DRAGON.",1289692800,,3392,4.6202321724709785

272833,5,6300250164,"I saw this film when it was first released in the Philippines.  My ship, the Francis Hammond of the US Navy, was in port in Manila and being a film lover, I wanted to experience a film the way the Philippinos did.  A friend and I went to a theater and this film was playing.  I was not an martial arts fan, but I knew martial arts films were very popular in the far east so we bought our tickets.  Did I say popular?!!!  The theatre was as large as a large theater in the US.  The seating was made of continuous rows of wooden benches, no backs, stretched out in curves like a Roman theater, and people were squashed in.  The isles on the sides were filled (no fire code?) and people spilled out the entry double doors.  We had to stand about four feet outside the entrance.  However, we could see the whole screen.  I was ready to leave, not looking forward to an hour and a half of standing.  BOY, was I glad I stayed!  Bruce Lee plays a country boy from China, who is looked on at first as a bit of a bumpkin by his cousins whom he is visiting in Italy.  The dialog is in Mandarin, Italian and English.  We had two sets of subtitles, Tagolog (the national language of the Philippines), and English.  Most of the humor comes from the various groups not being able to understand each other.  The audience loved the film, laughing, cheering, and tensely silent in all the right places.  The story has great charm as well as great action.  By the end, we all liked Bruce Lee's character so much that when he is losing to Chuck Norris we were desperate for him to come back and win.  This was one of the best film experiences of my life.  So, when I came back to the US, I discovered that the US distributors had dubbed the film.  It was a disaster.  The film was brushed off as being bad except for the marvelously choreographed fight scenes and for Bruce Lee.  I have since seen all of Bruce Lee's films since then, and with the original sound track, this one is one of the best.  Watch it with the original soundtrack.",1265155200,3,2019,4.225130890052356

This is the Hong Kong version which I actually did see once in the US once many years ago and it was most likely on television. Anyway, to have the original Manadrin makes the dialogue work with the lip movements and is an excellent addition. I recommend watching it this way. One little thing missing is that when Bruce gets a bloody lip in the final fight, he tastes his own blood before continuing the fight. If you look closely there is a cut at this point. Parts of the country had that in the original release and parts didn't. Enter the Dragon stillhas this blood tasting.

As a result, he called the shots on ""Way of the Dragon"" (1972). In his third starring feature, director-writer Lee emphasizes humor and characterization. Bruce plays a resourceful martial artist named Tang Lung who arrives in Rome to protect his relatives from mobsters. The highpoint is a climactic battle between Bruce and Chuck Norris in the Roman Colosseum  perhaps Lee's most brutal fight sequence. Though enjoyable, the remaining action scenes lack the bravura of ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Fist of Fury.""

But I must admit, the face-off fight between Chuck Norris and Bruce is classic.  This is the main reason to get this film.  It shows how adaptable Lee's Jeet Kune Do fighting style was.  Bruce used Mohammad Ali like foot work and feinting to wear down his opponent, then attacked with his lightening speed and power.

272927,5,6300250164,"Set in Rome, Return of the Dragon (ROTD) is the last of Bruce's Hong Kong-produced films.  Unlike Hollywood-produced Enter the Dragon, the English is dubbed, the production quality low by comparison. Yet, this movie is highly entertaining.  Enter the Dragon was Bruce's biggest film, but there's something about ROTD that makes it his most exciting.

The fight-to-the-death showdown with martial arts legend, Chuck Norris, elevates ROTD to cult-classic status.  Any kid that was a fan of the martial arts in the 1970's and 1980's wanted to see Bruce ""beat"" Chuck.

Like all of Bruce's movies, ROTD's fight scenes are brilliant, amazing, things of beauty.  Though the fights are (obviously) staged, the athleticism displayed is otherworldly.  They're quite funny, too.  Bruce's charm and good sense of comic expression come through, particularly in the sparring/training scenes in the alley.

Enter the Dragon is really a James Bond film with lots of martial arts.(See my review.)  ROTD, by contrast, is more in the tradition of Hong Kong kung fu films in which battles are fought for justice, honor, revenge, protection of family and loved ones, etc.

If you like martial arts films, ROTD is essential viewing.  It's fun even if you're only mildly interested in -- or can just tolerate -- martial arts.",1149120000,4,1302,5.147619047619048

If you're looking for a serious kung fu flick like ""Enter the Dragon"" you will only be disappointed by this movie.  Of course, if you just want to see Lee or your like Jackie Chan style movies that are action-comedies, then this film might be for you.

The plot here is a little hard to follow, probably because the movie has been cut and subtitled for this DVD.  Basically, Lee ends up in Rome and he's helping a guy protect his restaurant from mobsters.  The movie consists of several scenes where the mobsters attack, they do some damage, and then Lee shows up and puts everything back in order by destroying the bad guys, even when they come back with more men and guns.

Finally, the bad guys resort to bringing in a hired gun--an American champion played by Chuck Norris.  Norris doesn't utter a word in this film, but he does look pretty cool until the unfortunate moment when he takes off his shirt and revolts everyone with his out of control back hair.  The climactic fight takes place in the Colliseum.  Of course, it's to the death.  It's definitely a well-choreographed scene with a bit of artistic vision in the cinematography.

273027,4,6300250164,"After the phenomenal success of Bruce Lee's first two martial arts films ( ""The Big Boss"" & ""Fist Of Fury"" ), Bruce broke free of the past fiery relationship with director Lo Wei, and formed Concord Productions to handle the next step in his skyrocketing film career. The influx of funds from the success of Bruce Lee's two preceding movies, allowed Bruce to budget for more exotic locations (Rome, Italy), more accomplished oppenents ( hapkido expert Ing-Sik Whang, karate champion Bob Wall, and seven times US karate champion Chuck Norris) and an overall better production quality.

Bruce Lee wrote, directed and starred in ""Way Of The Dragon"", and the plot line does not drift too far away from his first success (""The Big Boss""), as Lee once again plays a seemingly, simply country boy (Tang Lung) who travels to Rome, Italy to work in a relatives restaurant. Upon arrival, his cousins all assume Tang Lung to be a rather meek & naive character, until gangsters visit the restaurant to try to extort money from the Chinese owners. All parties head out into the back alley, and after a couple of his relatives are floored, Bruce hands out a punishing demonstration in chinese kung fu ( ""...dragon whips his tail..."" ) and throttles several of his bigger Anglo opponents much to the amazed delight of Nora Miao. The demoralised gangsters limp back to their boss, detailing about their shock loss, and the stakes are raised higher as the criminals try to take Bruce out of the picture using guns and hitmen. Their repeated attempts fail, and the thugs are forced to recruit three outsiders, all lethal fighters ( Ing-Sik Whang, Bob Wall & Chuck Norris ) to kill the unstoppable Tang Lung (Lee). The film, is of course famous for the incredible showdown between Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris at the Colisseum in Rome, as the two modern ""gladiators"" fight to the death in a well choregraphed fight sequence....with a small kitten the only witness to the action.

""Return Of The Dragon"" aka ""Way of The Dragon"" was another solid box office success for Bruce Lee in Asia, and further cemented his position as the number one actor in Hong Kong. Regrettably, only a year later, Lee would be dead and the world shocked by the premature death of such a rising star. Now concerning the DVD versions of this film, several people have commented on this site about the DVD version available on Amazon.com (Region 1 release by CBS/FOX with red tinted cover) detailing how it is missing various footage, only in Dolby 2.0 mono and other issues.

However all is not lost, so log onto the Amazon site in the UK, you will find the Hong Kong Legends Special Collectors Edition of ""Way Of The Dragon"", that (in my opinion) is the best presentation of this movie available on DVD to date. Hold your breath....here's all the great stuff included : a digitally remastered 2:35.1 Anamorphic widescreen UNCUT presentation (superb picture), plus Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio for both the dubbed English soundtrack and the original Cantonese soundtrack. ( Just wait till you hear the kicks and punches in the Colisseum fight recreated in Dolby 5.1 !!! ). In addition, there is an insightful feature length audio commentary by martial arts fanatic Bey Logan & actor Jon Benn, plus several excellent photo galleries, plus original HK & UK theatrical trailers, plus interviews with Andre Morgan, Anders Nielsen & Jon Benn  ! The DVD is Region 2, so you will need a multi-zone DVD player ( You do have one don't you ? ). Furthermore, there is another Region 2 twin disc Hong Kong Legends Platinum Edition of ""Way Of The Dragon"" (same high quality image and audio) plus, with interviews with Bob Wall, Ing-Sik Whang, Robert Lee and Pat Johnson. The 2nd disc is split into four menu areas : Interview Gallery, Promotional Archive, Information Archive and the Hong Kong Collection....each area is loaded with sensational interviews and biographical material that is both rare and of great interest to Bruce Lee fans. If you are a fan, then both these offerings are well worth having !",1113004800,11,4044,4.806034482758621

273029,4,6300250164,"This movie is a knockout and it was the first film Bruce Lee wrote and directed. The result: Better than ""Fist of Fury"" and better than ""The Big Boss"". I would give this dvd 5 stars hands down if it wasn't missing two very entertaining scenes. About a year ago I picked up the vhs version in the U.K then when I found out it was avalible on dvd I didn't think twice about buying it. When I watched it I noticed two scenes had been cut from the U.S dvd version. Here is a discription of both.

""Restaurant Scene"": Bruce lee walks into a restaurant at the airport and sits down. He places his luggage on the seat next to him. He asks for eggs but the old waitress either doesnt have them or doesnt understand him (its hard to tell with such dodgy dubbing). After asking her a second time and getting no real response he opens the menu and points at several things. Seconds later he is givin five bowls of soup which he heaves down then burps, then pays, then walks out, then burps again.
Total time: 3min.

""Topless Scene"": Bruce Lee is sitting on a public bench and a woman puts her arm around him. Then he goes back to her apartment and practices his martial arts in her mirror while she is in another room. She then stands behind him without any cloths on and Bruce Lee bails.
Total time: 1min 15sec

I think both these scenes give you more understanding of his charictor. Bruce Lee wrote and filmed them for the simple reason he wanted people to see them. Shame on whoever chopped them out!
My advice is if your a hardcore Bruce Lee fan go to [...] and not only will you find the uncut version of the film but there is also a bonus disk packed with extras and the film quality is so much better. However it is from England so you will need a multi-region dvd player to watch it.",1092787200,5,1780,4.214076246334311

The action in the movie is also pretty good. Not as great as some of Bruce's other films but still impressive.

Bruce is so fast with his feet its no wonder he is amazing on screen i love this movie and the collection and you should check them out.  The dubing isn't too bad but not great.

273032,5,6300250164,"Bruce Lee wrote, directed and stars in this masterpiece.. The original title was Way of the Dragon, but after the tremendous success of Enter The Dragon (1973), the title was renamed ""Return of the Dragon."" Lee is a country boy going to Italy help a family friend whose Chinese restaurant is being bullied by local gangsters.
The movie is nothing short of brilliant and it has several themes to it, and yes I'll explain everyone of them.
Bruce Lee in all his films managed to maintain a family element in his films. He is either fighting alongside family members against crooked politicians or Chinese gangs. In short, he comes to his family's defense when they need him.
Also unlike most Hollywood directors who use people for a film and throw them away, Lee always wanted to include his friends in his films (Chuck Norris, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Nora Miao and others).
The costar of this film, Nora Miao was in The Chinese Connection and Fists of Fury. She is a pretty decent actress in those films.
So Bruce comes in to help his family from these thugs threating their humble establishment and he beats the hell out of them. LOL
I remember the first time as a kid I saw Bruce Lee's movie in the U.S. not only were they good ,but soon after many Asian stars (Jet Li, Chow Yung Fat, Jackie Chan) saw there was a market for martial arts action and gave their best efforts to live up to the same high quality Bruce Lee had in his movies.
On top of that, the whole Martial Arts movement have inspired many people to take self defense karate courses and martial arts training. A kick can do much more damage than a fist sometimes.
Anyhow, soon the head crime boss (Robert Wall who is the godfather of Freddie Prince Jr.) enlist the help of a famous US martial artist named Colt (Chuck Norris) to eliminate Bruce.
The action scenes are incredible. To see Bruce go into his routine and execute his moves to perfection is inspiring.
Especially the fight with Chuck Norris, before fights him he goes into a mind boggling array of stretch exercises that were soon copied by bogus Bruce Lee imitators including Chuck Norris.
Without giving too much away, the film is jam-packed with flying fists, kicks and humor.
In one scene for example, an Italian thug tries to use Bruce Lee's nunchucks against him and ends up hurting himself!!!
The movie is a great buy for any action fan, and if you're a Bruce Lee fan, you should have this in you're collection.
More info about the movie:
On Amazon.com, the movie has gotten great feedback from it's viewers, including Leonard Maltin.
Chuck Norris was a student of Bruce Lee's martial arts school along with James Coburn, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and others.
Raymond Chow produced this film but it was Lee who wrote ,directed and starred in it.
Raymond Chow has executively produced other great martial arts films like ""Police Story"" by Jackie Chan and the Bruce Lee movies ""Fists of Fury"" , ""Chinese Connection"" and ""Enter the Dragon.""",1088553600,,2961,4.641904761904762
273033,5,6300250164,"This in my opinion is the best ""movie"" that Bruce Lee starred in. Not only did he star in it, but wrote it, and directed it also. This is Bruce's work, and in my opinion his best work. The fighting was great, Bruce's charisma was great, the characters were great, the story, the comedy, the final showdown with Chuck Norris...Everything..!! It is just a great film and showcases how talented Bruce was, not only in martial arts, but as a writer, director, and actor. A definate MUST SEE for all Bruce Lee fans!!",1080604800,,511,4.505376344086022
273034,4,6300250164,"Return Of The Dragon is best known for it's climatic fight scene at the end of the movie. However, what gets lossed is the excellent battle between Bruce and the various thugs in the flick. Like his previous two films, this has bad acting, bad writing, laughable voice dubbing, etc. It is watchable because of one reason: Bruce Lee.
Once again Bruce comes to a foreign land to help family. In Rome, some of his cousins are running a chinese resteraunt. They are being bullied into selling the land to a local crime syndicate. Bruce shows up to help them with their problem. I will give you one guess on how he deal with said problem. He kicks everyone's ass.
I will say the acting and dialogue here is way better than his first two films. You can tell the budget was raised for this one. But even if you hate this movie, you must see it for the end battle between Bruce and Chuck Norris. At the time, Norris wasn't in movies. He was an american karate champion. He does give Bruce his best challenge in any movie I have seen him in. Their fighting styles are quite different and it's cool to see these two marial arts icons on screen fighting each other. To my knowledge, this is the only 'bad-guy' role Norris has done. He does it well.
And setting the fight in the Roman Colosiums was a nice touch. You will notice, though that most of the fight is actually filmed in a cheap studio set made to look like the colosiums. It's a great fight and any martial arts fan owes it to themselves to see this battle. Just try not to get grossed out by how hairy Norris is.
The rest of the film has some very good fights. There are 3 big ones, where Bruce takes on like 10 guys by himself. They are quite impressive. I think this is the best of the first three films he made. It's the most well rounded, best acted, and has one of the best fight scenes in movie history in it.
Like the other movies in this boxed set, the DVD comes bare-bones. If you get the boxed set, though, it comes with a movie-style documentary, so it makes up for the fact that the flicks have no special features.",1073260800,,2078,4.263291139240506
273035,3,6300250164,"""Return of the Dragon"" (originally released as ""Way of the Dragon"") is no masterpiece, but it's a reasonably enjoyable kung-fu romp. The simple story involves Bruce Lee's character going to Rome to help out with his relatives' restaurant. When he gets there, he pretty much beats up the gang members who are terrorizing the restaurant one by one. The climactic fight scene has Lee duking it out with Chuck Norris, and is very memorable. The movie even has a few comedic moments early on, and this has the distinction of being the only movie that Bruce Lee ever wrote and directed (besides ""Game of Death,"" which was completed after his death).
The DVD has ""Return of the Dragon"" in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The opening scenes are a little scratchy and there is occasional distortion, but for the most part, it looks as good as you could wish. The only audio is the English dubbed track. The voices are very wooden, and it makes one wish that the original track had been included with subtitles. Unfortunately, besides some extremely brief liner notes, there are no extra features. A theatrical trailer is advertised on the box, but it is nowhere to be found.",1072915200,,1167,4.753694581280788

273106,4,6300250164,"[Note: The UK DVD version from Hong Kong Legends has (1)The best DVD quality. (2)The best DVD extras. (3)The proper TITLES for Bruce Lee films (The US titles are very muddled around).]
Much of the cast from Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection US title) are back in this Italian mobster / martial arts flick.  The story is quite simply a case of the Italian mob trying to get the daughter of a recently deceased restaurant owner to sell the property over with little success and so they turn to violently disrupting the restaurant's clients and employees. Bruce Lee arrives from Hong Kong to solve the problem which allows for various set pieces involving lots of fist and foot action.
Way of the Dragon (or Return of the Dragon US title) isn't a patch on Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection US title) in terms of story or Bruce Lee kicking bad guys around the place but it does bolster some fine moments all the same including a very good final showdown with Chuck Norris in which both martial artists flex their wares before going at one on one.
Although Bruce Lee has improved on his technique since the latter films this may disappoint those who where expecting more action than what was in Fist of Fury. The nunchaku scene is certainly less graphic or intense than the one in the Fist of Fury but at least he has two of them this time! There is also a very good scene involving a test bag kick which sends the bag holder flying and an okay kick-about on some wastelands but the end fight between Lee and Norris is really what this movie is about and this is probably the only reason why you should want to watch this. So get this movie to see one of the great Bruce Lee one on one battles, but choose Fist of Fury if you want to see Bruce Lee scrapping virtually non-stop.",1063929600,2,1778,4.404255319148936

I mean that literally , because he's always off of his feet , kicking someone in the face. The alley scenes are hilarious and cleverly shot. But the definate highlight of this film is the showdown in the greek colosiums with a very young Chuck Norris. The filming was clever and imaginative , and there's an early attempt and a dolly shot (when Bruce is walking through the colosium). As for the showdown ? It's a classic fight that ends with even more class. I won't spoil it for you , but it goes to show that respect for an opponant is just as important as the actual fight itself. Ironic, that these philosophies are highlighted in Mr. Lee's overseas films , but not so much in the american one(s).

273217,5,6300250164,"This GREAT action flick, written, directed, & produced (and starring) Bruce Lee is one of my favorite martial-arts films of all time.
The plot centers around gangsters in Italy trying to force a Chinese restaurant to sell out.  When they refuse, the mafia pushes & the restaurant owners ask a friend of theirs, a ""country bumpkin"" from Hong-Kong's New Territories to help out.  However, THIS bumpkin is no ORDINARY bumpkin, because he just happens to be a kung-fu expert!
Mixing LOTS of subtle humor (by playing upon the audience's expectations about stereo-types) & breaking the conventions & rules of Hong-Kong martial-arts films of the time (for instance, filming in Italy!), this film is probably, in my opinion, Bruce Lee's finest film.  (That's no coincidence, since he had TOTAL artistic control over it!)
The fight scenes are also very realistic, as far as flashy kung-fu fight choreography goes.  The fight with Chuck Norris at the end, in the Roman Coliseum (to symbolize the two fighters as modern day gladiators) is one of the best ever filmed.  It still stands up today, even when compared to the likes of Jackie Chan & Jet Li.
And then there's the dialogue!  Most kung-fu movies from the 1970's have lines that are UNINTENTIONALLY funny, in a b-movie sort of way.  The lines in this film are funny, because Lee intended them to be!  (The ""Chinese spareribs"" line & the ""Chinese boxer"" line are examples of Lee's hip wit!)
If you can get this in widescreen format (& in it's original language format), the better.  If not, it's still worth buying.  Despite the ""R"" rating, there really isn't any gore or excessive violence, thus making ""Return of The Dragon"" (or ""Way of The Dragon"", as it's originally titled) appropriate fare for the entire family.",1026345600,,1763,4.885906040268456
273218,3,6300250164,"The master of Kung-fu and originator of Jeet Kune Do (Way of the Fist) tries his hand at making his own martial arts masterpiece. Bruce Lee wrote and directed this film, as well as stars as Tang Lung, a student of 'Chinese Boxing' in Hong Kong. Tang travels to Rome, Italy to help out a friend's family who has opened a restaurant there. The family has been harassed by the local crime boss and his underlings, who threaten to destroy the restaurant if they don't sell it to the mafia. Tang helps out by training the restaurateur's five sons in the ways of 'Chinese Boxing' to fend off the thugs, and when the crime boss actually shows up, throws himself into the fight. The boss later enlists the aid of a Japanese, a European, and an American karate master to deal with Tang and the boys, which leads to a final showdown between Tang and the American master (played by none other than a young Chuck Norris!).
Needless to say, there's not a lot of plot here. This is mostly a Westernized version of any episode of ""Kung-Fu Theater"", with some attractive sights of surrounding Rome thrown in. Bruce didn't necessarily do a bad job with this film, but he wasn't exactly a master storyteller, either. The biggest draw for me, personally, was seeing Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris, and was what made me want to buy the DVD. Don't get me wrong; Bruce does kick some major ... in this one, and shows off quite a bit of his legendary martial arts and weapons skills, particularly with the nunchaku. There is a little bit of comedy in this one as well (the dubbing alone was comedy enough for me), and a little plot twist near the end, though that does little more than warrant a few head-scratchings. The final fight between Lee and Norris is...well, decent, taking place in the Roman Colisseum, but it could've been a bit better. Seeing the two warm up before the fight ups the anticipation meter a little and shows off some of Chuck's skill, too. As far as DVD extras, there aren't any, but since this is an older film (and not a well-known one), I'll let that slide.
Yeah, it's no ""Crouching Tiger"" by any stretch, but as a straight-up,...kung-fu flick, it does the job well enough. Hey, it's Bruce Lee, after all, and fans of his should get their money's worth. Just try not to take it too seriously...",1022630400,,2296,4.4952153110047846

If u want to see his best this is the one baby! There are some people who don't know their movies. Chuck was in Return of the Dragon not Enter. Another response is to the person who said that he doesn't hit close enough is wrong he only does one scene where his kicks lands short. Bruce is not degrading Karate, it is from kung-fu.

273302,4,6300250164,"ENTER THE DRAGON was Chuck Norris' first movie part, and he did it as a favor for his friend, Bruce Lee. This movie contains the only fight scene to my knowledge in which Lee is decked by an opponent. While the fight scene between Norris and Lee is somewhat stiff on NORRIS' PART(he hadn't yet learned the art of movie fighting), the exchange between the two reflect the two classic styles of solid rock-hard karate versus fluid, graceful kung fu as it was practiced at that time. The plot and acting may have been less than first rate, but the fight scenes are some of the best filmed up to that time and well worth seeing.",995846400,5,624,4.387931034482759
273303,5,6300250164,"This is perhaps the best martial arts (from a basic, pure karate perspective) movie, from the man who had started the whole martial arts revolution on screen and made it a household name.  There are probably many martial artists who are, and were better than Bruce Lee, but no one compares to him when it comes to understanding the arts and how to project it on screen.  His sense of choreographing fight scenes is still unmatched in the world of cinematic martial arts.  This is the one simple reason what makes 'Return of the Dragon' the best of Lee's movies.  The climatic battle scene with Chuck Norris remains the best-choreographed karate demonstration on screen, so far.  He was perhaps the only true movie martial artist who could take of his shirt and have the male audience want a body like him.  Like, 'Enter the Dragon', this movie didn't have a host of big-name martial arts stars like Jim Kelly, Yang Ze, and others.  It had a relatively unknown Chuck Norris (to the rest of the world) after his reign as a seven-time US Karate champion, but the movie did make Norris a household name.  Return of the Dragon remains Lee at his best, without all the glamor and high budget extravaganza of Enter the Dragon.  If you like Bruce Lee, and martial arts, the buck stops here.",995587200,8,1282,4.612334801762114

273306,4,6300250164,"This movie, originally titled ""Way of the Dragon"" is a classic.  This movie was written, directed, produced, and of course, starred by Bruce Lee.  Bruce Lee, after his first two martial arts movies, gained enough financial clout to start his own production company and therefore, called the shots on this picture.
It is witty, a little campy and unlike modern versions of love interest stories - this is pure.  The most outstanding element however, is Bruce.  He throws in a little ""fighting"" philosophy without resorting to ""preachiness"" and is perfect as the homespun and green hero.
The fight sequences are fun and honest.  The climated scene pits Bruce Lee against Chuck Norris, batting it out in the Roman Colessuem (and its staged set counter-part).  This battle is also an expression of Lee's philosophy on a smaller guy battling a bigger-stronger opponent.  This last battle is still the runnng favoriate among movie fight fans.  An entertaining movie for most, but especially for martial arts enthusiast.",991612800,3,1013,5.134146341463414

Bruce Lee is in my opinion the greatest martial arts master of all time. Bruce Lees performance in this film is awesome. All sorts of martial arts maneuvers ar shown. Also Chuckie Norris is included in this film, where at the ending of the movie he must battle with Lee but you will have to purchase the movie in order to see who wins :). All through the movie he shows us a fantastic array of fighting. He must fight several opponents which are mediocre in martial arts but they are no match for Bruce Lee.

273409,2,6300250164,"A few things are obvious from the start, the movie is boring except for the few martial art scenes. I get the feeling that Bruce Lee is putting-down Karate, this starts when a Karate student is easily beaten by a boxer (one punch), then at the end of the movie Chuck Norris (Karate world champion) is easily beaten by Bruce Lee. There is no way the Chuck Norris would have been so easily beaten if the fight was real. Until Chuck Norris enters the movie the movie is boring. I also think if Chuck Norris had seen the final movie he may never had been part of it. The movie appears to be an attempt by Bruce to advertise his Chinese Boxing, while putting down Karate at the same time. The worst acting/plot I have ever seen.",983318400,2,723,4.2846715328467155
273410,5,6300250164,"Bruce Lee is The Man, The Dragon, a loving father, and in this movie, he not only beats the crap out of the Texas Ranger, but done a good acting job  in his terms.  Bruce Lee, unlike martial arts posers like Chuck Norris and  Steve Blackman, (WWF) he is a real martial artist and his speed,  determination, and power in his jeet kune do skills is inhuman, and it  shows in the movie.  Although he doesn't have the stamina and endurance of  Jackie Chan, since Jackie does crazy stunts with broken bones as a living,  but Bruce Lee is one of the few people that will beat you down if you  challenge him and make it look good.  When he fights, it looks like he's  dancing with grace!  Return of the Dragon is my favorite Bruce Lee movie of  all time, it has lots of action scenes and is always fun to watch over and  over.

While the story and characters  may be weak, Lee knows how to provide excellent fight scenes in interesting  locations.  The best example of this is the final fight with Chuch Norris.  Lee makes it look as though he and Norris are two gladiators fighting in  ancient Rome.

273412,5,6300250164,"Bruce Lee directs and stars in this enjoyable and entertaining martial arts masterpiece. The fight choreography in this movie is probably the most realistic as it can get when compared to all of the other martial arts movies to date. Dropping the more traditional Wing Chun style, like in Lee's previous movies (ie ""Fist Of Fury"" [Chinese Connection]) - Lee uses, in what he thinks is the more superior fighting style, Jeet Kun Do, when he goes up against his opponents. The best fight scene was with Lee and Chuck Norris in the Roman colloseum. I loved it when Lee starts to warm-up before the fight, educating the audience on how to properly stretch before practicing martial arts or engaging in combat.  When the fight starts, Norris gets the upper hand at first, but when Lee initializes his Jeet Kun Do style, Lee systematically takes out his opponent with a flurry of punches and kicks, and then dismembering his arm and taking out his knee cap.  Lee then finishes Norris off with a neck breaking arm lock.  Bruce Lee is definately a capable street fighter, which he shows in all of his wonderful movies, especially in ""Return Of The Dragon"".
