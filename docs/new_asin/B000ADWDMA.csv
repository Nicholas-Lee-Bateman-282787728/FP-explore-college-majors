8324985,4,B000ADWDMA,von Trotta is a super writer and director. Hope to be working with her soon. In my opinion her very best film is 'Rosa Luxemburg'; However it's not available is the USA. Amazon.de has a few copies with the original German dialogue. And it's is PAL not NTSC which is used in the USA.,1375315200,8,282,4.2407407407407405
