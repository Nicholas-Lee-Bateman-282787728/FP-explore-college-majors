2800845,5,B000OVLBH6,"At LAST this 80s CLASSIC gets the DVD treatment it deserves!!

[minor spoiler alert!]

This was a wonderful show during the years it aired.  I fondly remember many of the episodes.  Some elements of this show still stick with me to this day.  When Jason Bateman left the show, my real-life best friend moved to another state.  Being a 4th grader at the time, this made the show and the whole experience really hit home.  This series was light-hearted, but still managed to present themes and situations that kids really went through.  As a 30-something adult, whenever I think of that time of my life, this television show instantly springs to mind.

On a side note, Rick Schroder will always be ""Ricky"" to me.  And Erin Gray is still incredibly beautiful to this day!  Long live ""The Ricker"" !!",1179360000,14,795,4.64748201438849
2800846,5,B000OVLBH6,I can't wait for this season to be released...growing up in the 1980's...this was one of my all time favorite shows...I really hope they release all of the seasons....,1175644800,4,167,4.793103448275862

It's also very funny! I love the cast and I don't care what is holding everything up, they should have already released the seasons years ago. I hate all this copyright stuff on shows. They do everything else! I was thinking how a lot of older shows are getting on Netflix...they have a long way to go! Silver Spoons should be released and enjoyed.",1481241600,,517,4.34020618556701

2800996,5,B000OVLBH6,I love this show. Im a huge fan of ricky and this show means a lot to me. The funny thing is i wasn't around when the show was on. I'm only 18 and i started watching ricky schroder films after watching his interview on johnny carson on youtube. I love all of his films and this show.

2801019,5,B000OVLBH6,WORTH IT.,1415318400,,9,4.0
2801020,5,B000OVLBH6,"There used to be such a thing as GOOD situation comedies! Best of all, they didn't feel the need to be profane in order to make people laugh! The characters were ones that we could many times relate to! This series, for instance, is a time capsule into the 80's and much of the style of what it represented!
Unlike the sitcoms today, families can sit and watch these episodes together! More important than that,
this series and many others attempted to teach people morals and values!
This is a funny series...and Ricky Schroder was such a talented young actor! The family portrayed in the series
seem like they could well be father and son! Though this family had wealth, young Ricky experienced much of the same situations as ordinary children!
I miss television shows like this one! If you enjoy this, check out Webster, Punky Brewster, Diff'rent Strokes and The Facts of Life!
Take a trip back in time with this series! You'll laugh...you'll cry...and you'll appreciate the innocence that
you USED to find in television sitcoms! Highly recommended!",1414022400,6,1052,4.85

2801025,5,B000OVLBH6,"I have loved ""Silver Spoons"" since I used to watch it religiously as a kid.  The price I paid for this season was perfect and I was able to introduce my kids to one of the best shows of the 80s.  They loved it just as much--or more--than I always have.  The jokes still hold up today and are just as hilarious.  I just wish they would get the other seasons out on DVD.  I hope the remaining seasons haven't been permanently shelved, as they deserve to see the light of day.

These kept them entertained and we were happy to see them watching something that we know was okay. The tv shows today are not like they used to be. You wonder why kids have problems when they see a carrot talking to a clam???? I mean really!!!! Their is a plot and you can follow it and it has a resolution with real people that is followed throughout. Good continuity to the stories and good humor.

2801094,5,B000OVLBH6,"Here they are, face to face. A couple of silver spoons. Hopin' to find, they're two of a kind. Making a go, making it grow together on DVD for the first time with Silver Spoons - The Complete First Season from Sony Home Entertainment. This 3-disc (single-sided) set features all 22 episodes in Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; English Dolby Digital audio; Closed Captioning for the hearing impaired; plus the following guest stars Robert Picardo (""Star Trek: Voyager""), Jason Bateman (""Arrested Development""), John Houseman (""The Paper Chase""), Mr. T (""The A-Team""), John P.

Props to Sony for preserving the show in a neatly packaged DVD season set which features decent picture and sound. Keep 'em coming, Sony!

Despite the lack of extras, Silver Spoons - The Complete First Season is a DVD set I highly recommend to devoted fans of the show. The show (thanks to a great cast) is still fun and it looks and sounds good on DVD.",1297814400,4,1407,5.14410480349345

2801127,5,B000OVLBH6,"'Silver Spoons' is one of those hidden 'almost forgotten' treasures of eighties television.  In a tv landscape that thrived on cutting edge shows like 'Dallas', 'Dynasty' and 'Magnum P.I.', family shows were often overlooked.  I had no idea it had even been released on video until it was recommended to me on Netflix.  From there, I rushed over here to purchase it! My only disappointment is that I can't get every episode!  There are some I've only seen ONCE!  I grew up with a pre-teen crush on 'The Ricker' and adoring Erin Gray as a strong yet feminine role model.  Simply put, this cast was terrific and had great chemistry with each other.  When I purchased it, I sat down with my 10 year old son and we watched the entire first season dvd in 3 evenings.  He absolutely loved it!  He picked up on so many good 'lessons' that the quality family series taught too.  I so want him to have a chance to enjoy the rest of the series and follow Ricky through teenage-dom as he and Edward and Kate figure it all out together.  Just wonderful, fun, clean television like we rarely see on any channel today!",1285027200,13,1104,4.47
2801128,5,B000OVLBH6,"Ricky Stratton(Ricky Schorder)is at a Military Boarding school and has a desire to live with his father, Edward Stratton the third(Joel Higgins). Ricky decides to leave the boarding school and move in with his father. Edward refuses to have him live with him at first-He sends Ricky back to the Military school. However, he changes his mind and goes to pick up Ricky himself dressed as a swamp creature!

Edward is an adult that never grew up. He lives in a mansion. His Living room is equipped with toys, video arcade games, a computerized chess set-and the ever popular mini freight train that is used to get to one room to another. The premise of this show(At first)was that Edward could teach Ricky to be more of a kid and Ricky could teach Edward to be less of a kid.

Ricky is a remarkable young man. He is very smart-and knows a lot about computers(This is 1982-Windows was still years away)yet he isn't a smart alec know it all. He has a self confidence and assertiveness to stand up for himself-whether it's the bully at school, or a 12 year old toy consultant that Edward wants to hire-she won't sign the contract unless he agrees to be his girl freind. He agrees at first-but things goes to far-Edward decides to let Ricky handle it his own way. HE doesn't allow himself to be bullied or taken advantage of. Ricky is such an adorable young man and he's so cute and has an infectious smile.

This doesn't mean that Ricky is a perfect too gooder. He gets into situations that any kid gets into. Like testing Edward to see how far he can go before Edward Puninhes him for bad behaviour-or sneaking out at night to search for a primate like creature rumoured to be in the area. Yet, he learns his lesson at the end of the episode.

There are some impressive guest stars on this show-Jason Bateman is Ricky's arogant pal-Derek, Erin Gray is Edward's Loyal seretary-Kate summers-who he eventualy marries. And John Houseman is Edward's Father-Edward Stratton the second-who is bitter and disaproves of Edwards lifestlye. I guess having assets of 30 million as shown in the pilot isn't enough for him. Ricky is caught in the middle of the conflict between Edward and his father.

I love the scenes Between Edward the second and Ricky. John Houseman and Ricky Schroder had great chemistry, that the writers have written long scenes between the two. Ricky has great respect for his grandfather-yet he isn't afraid to tell him the truth as he sees it. No matter how bitter he is towards his son-he is fond of Ricky-even if he doesn't show it. Deep down inside, he loves his son and Edward loves his father. The scenes between Ricky and Grandfather are quite remarkable-and well written.

Ricky Schorder is a lot more than just adorable-he is extremly talented. He is such a good actor and has shown he can do comedy as well as drama. So far only the first season is on DVD and has 22 episodes-including the pilot on 3 single sided discs-There are no special features but that doesn't matter-I'm just glad the first season is on DVD. Sony needs to release the other 4 seasons.

2801131,5,B000OVLBH6,"There are so many who want all five seasons out on DVD, isn't the purchase price enough to cover the production costs? If not, I'd rather see the cost of the DVDs go up, then not have them at all. If Sony doesn't want to put out Seasons 2-5, why not sell the copyrights to someone who will? Those of us, who have the majority of the series, have so, because we either kept the tapes from when the show aired or have made copies for our friends. While I'm glad to be one of those individuals, the quality (as you can imagine) is not that great and it's not fair to those who don't have access to these tapes. I'm not sure what degree of profit, Sony had intended on, but maintaining loyal (and not frustrated) customers should count for something.

 It's just such a shame. Season 2 is my favorite, not to mention the fact that Alphonso Ribeiro doesn't debut until at least Season 3 and it was awesome watching Ricky grow up, by Season five, he was gorgeous.

 Heck, a complete set would have made nice Christmas gifts for the kiddies.",1256860800,4,1034,4.314432989690721

In the first few episodes, one can see the Rubik's Cube, mentioning the movie E.T., classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, etc.  One can also see a VERY young Jason Bateman who was sooooooo cute on the show and even Gary Coleman from Diff'rent Strokes makes an appearance on ""The Great Computer Caper"" episode.  My favorite episode is ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"" mainly because Jason is seen throughout the entire episode!!  :D  SUPERB acting, Jason, for your character as Derek Taylor!!!  You've should've gotten just as much publicity as Ricky Schroder did if not MORE!!!  And also because I remember seeing this one when 'Spoons first aired.

I highly recommend this to anyone who's a Jason Bateman or a Ricky Schroder fan (like myself) or to someone who also likes shows such as Growing Pains, Who's the Boss, Punky Brewster, etc.  Please, Sony Pictures, bring us Seasons 2-4 soon.  Thanks.",1199577600,,1028,4.817142857142857
2801168,5,B000OVLBH6,"I got this set for christmas, and it was definitely my favorite gift this year!  Silver Spoons was one of my favorite shows as a kid.  I was the same age as Ricky when the show first aired, and I remember looking forward to it coming on each week!  Back then I never would have imagined I'd get to see it all again, some 25 years later!  I put the first disc in, and as soon as the intro started and showed the Silver Spoons logo and the house, it took me right back to being 10 years old again!  I didn't think I remembered the theme song, but as soon as it started I sang every word.  My 12-year-old son watched the first 5 episodes with me, and he laughed as much as I did.  With it being an early 80's show, I wasn't expecting it to be quite as funny for me at 35 as it was at 10, but it was.  They really had some good writers for the show!  Lots of funny lines that kept us laughing even today.  We can't wait to watch the rest!",1198713600,3,934,3.8684210526315788
2801169,5,B000OVLBH6,"I bought this dvd set, because it reminded me of when I was a kid and watched it on tv.  I just thought Ricky Schroeder was the best and oh so cute!!  LOL!!!!  Watching them, just brought back a lot of great childhood memories.  Of course the show is corny and watching it now versus then, there is a huge difference in how I perceive it.  I did enjoy it though.  So if you are looking for something that is light hearted and will remind you of some fond 80's memories, don't let this set pass you by!!!!",1198540800,2,504,4.091836734693878
2801170,5,B000OVLBH6,"This 1982-83 Season of SILVER SPOONS was a fabulous DVD as well as being the season that made SILVER SPOONS a big hit and made Rick Schroeder a star, plus I also liked that the 1st Season was the season where Arnold Drummond from DIFFERENT STROKES meets Ricky Stratton for the first time, which was a cast collide episode of SILVER SPOONS.
This season also brought back memories to me when I used to watch SILVER SPOONS at 8:30PM right after DIFFERENT STROKES at 8PM every Saturday night at one time from the Fall of 1982 thru the Summer of 1984, when they were both part of NBC's Saturday night line-up, especially since so many people have been anxiously awaiting for the 1983-84 Season of SILVER SPOONS to come out on DVD along with the fact that it's even better than the 1982-83 Season.

So now that I've watched every episode of SILVER SPOONS First Season on DVD, I can hardly wait till they put SILVER SPOONS-2nd Season on DVD, since I think the 1983-84 Season of SILVER SPOONS was even better the 1st Season was, but I don't know what's taking them so long to put the Second Season on DVD though, especially since it's been over a year since SILVER SPOONS 1982-83 Season has already been on DVD, but it would certainly make a wonderful X-Mas present for some people if they were to release SILVER SPOONS Second Season on DVD by the end of this year(2008).

It was also interesting seeing guest stars on this show
*Sharon Stone before she was even a star

*Joey Lawrence during his co-starring days on GIMME A BREAK

*Gary Coleman during his co-starring days on DIFFERENT STROKES

*Allison Smith before her co-starring days on KATE & ALLIE

*John Reilly during his co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN

*Jason Bateman's co-starring days as Ricky's arrogant buddy(Derrick Taylor) before his co-starring days as David Hogan on THE HOGAN FAMILY

*Bobby Beronsini and his skillful orangutang(Poppy)

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""Just Watch Us Now"", since that was their slogan on NBC from the Fall of 1982 thru the Summer of 1983, and when Ronald Reagan was president, and we had all those budget cuts from the recession we had, from 1981-1982!",1195430400,8,2197,4.627249357326479
2801171,5,B000OVLBH6,"Watching this show is like putting on a comfy pair of slippers. Sure, it's a lot hokier than what today's sitcom audiences are used to, but dare I say it's actually not as cheesy as I was expecting after all these years. Now that I'm older, I can see the heavy lifting Joel Higgins did to keep the show together - he really does a lot with the character of Edward Stratton III, elevating much of the material with his performance. And when they're not making Ricky cry on cue (which I think ebbed as the show went on), he does a great job of being cute and entertaining without falling into the ticks and obnoxiousness that did in so many other child actors.

If you're an 80s fan, in the pilot alone you'll get Pac-Man, the Rubik's Cube, and what appears to be a TRS-80 computer. A few episodes in, the ultimate 80s accessory, Mr. T, show up. It's nostalgia nirvana. For the kids of the 80s, this is home. Yes, people will still tease you for liking this show (that'll never change), but if you liked it before, you'll probably still like it now.

I just hope we get at least up to Season Four on DVD for the all-time classic ""Dexter Loves Whitney Houston"" episode.",1195344000,2,1166,4.344036697247707
2801172,5,B000OVLBH6,"I was so happy to see that this finally made it to dvd.  I loved this show when I was little.  I admit I bought this more for nostalgia, thought it might not be as funny as I remembered, but I loved it, young Ricky Schroder and Jason Bateman are great.  I was laughing out loud through most of the episodes, this show is still very funny today.  Great buy, well worth it at this price!",1193961600,3,385,4.026315789473684

The episode featuring ""Mr. T"" is absolutely hilarious!

2801199,4,B000OVLBH6,"There have been many disappointments along the way, we've been promised this DVD for several years now, but kept on hold because Sony didn't think the remakes would be a good seller.  I want all to know that it was well worth the wait.  The discs are better than anything seen on TV back in the 80's, the picture quality is superior to anything we could have expected on network TV back when.  I really enjoyed the pilot episode with Ricky and Derek when it all began, and it just keeps getting better from then on.  The part I really like is (NO COMMERCIALS), one can watch all 22 episodes with no commercial interruptions.  I hope Sony sells many copies, so that they will decide to remake the whole series from the pilot to the final episode.  This is a family program that everyone can enjoy and learn from.  Thanks Sony for finally giving us fans what we've been waiting for.  I highly recommend Silver Spoons to any parent who wants something wholesome for their children, there's nothing like this on TV today, and the price is affordable too.",1185667200,3,1050,4.518518518518518

2801203,5,B000OVLBH6,"I was so happy when I heard that they were re-releasing ""Silver Spoons"".  It was one of my favorite series growing up as a child.  I watched the entire first season in one day!

In the series premiere, twelve year old Ricky Stratton unexpectedly turns up on the doorstep of his father Edward Stratton the third, who had no idea that he even had a son.  It turns out that Ricky was a product of Edward's during his six day marriage to Evelyn. The mom had Ricky shipped off to military school after her second marriage. At first it looks like Edward who (according to him) doesn't know how to be a good husband, father, son etc.. is about to abandon Ricky too but he quickly realizes that having Ricky around is a lot better than NOT having him around - plus, now childlike Edward's finally got someone to play with!

Throughout the season, there are guest appearances that are made by other tv greats like Mr. T and Gary Coleman aka Arnold Jackson from Diff'rent Strokes.  Ricky's friend/foe is Derek (Jason Bateman) whom I think can best be described as a wolf in sheep's clothing.

This sitcom was a true gem in TV history.  I can't wait to see Season 2!",1182643200,2,1155,4.415094339622642
2801204,5,B000OVLBH6,"This TV show IS and WILL ALWAYS be my favorite show. I have all of these episodes taped from way back when I was a kid when the generation of the VHS (recorders came out). and that was not long after 1982 when Spoons began. I had to wait until reruns so I could tape them but it was worth all the wait. Now the tapes are dragging but (NO MORE). Sony did it! I know this will make Rick,Joel,Erin,Jason,Alfonso,Corky proud that this was released. Oh, and lets not forget the sly Christine Belford (Ricks Mom)..and, If only Mr houseman were alive. He made that show as well. He was (the greatest Grandfather). the bond between Rick and his grandfather was so great. ""Gotta love the learning to drive episode"". There are also some great guests on the show, Including Whitney houston,Mr T,Gary Coleman,Pearl Bailey and the ever so popular Menudo. This show makes you laugh,Cry,get angry like I did when Rick told freddy Lippincottleman that he wasn't his friend lol. The hardest thing in the world to see was derek leaving the show. That episode was very emotional. I was feeling at first that it wasn't going to be the same but the show was great from start to finish. For all you new people that are going to buy this....You are in for a real treat! Rick Schroder,(Ricker) you're an awesome actor!

R.I.P for two great actors franklin seales,John Houseman

PS: For those of you that worry that you have to buy so many sets that you might lose interest in this (do not worry) This show ran from 82 to 1987 so not many sets to buy. Please buy this so that Sony will continue to release them. I promise you won't be let down. Every season is great! of course the first three seasons are my favorite and rick grows in every season but all of them have a very good story!

(ADDED NOTE) I got the DVD set today and let me tell you...Brilliant picture quality. Fine remastering.  I am so pleased to toss out my first two VHS tapes that has the first season on them. I kept them because I was a little worried that they were going to edit the show's ending like they do sometime on tv for air time but sony did not butcher the show. silver spoons lovers will be very happy with what sony has presented us with this set. (Lets just hope they don't botch it up and leave people hanging for a year or so for each additional season release.",1180137600,12,2325,4.350230414746544
2801205,5,B000OVLBH6,"Silver Spoons was one of definitive eighties time capsule. This series was pure eighties, break dancing, big hair, music, posters. Ricky Schroder shines his title role, and he surrounded many well-remembered characters. Even legendary actor John Houseman appeared and Erin Gray really made big impression with her stepmother role. But, my favorite character is probably Rick's pal played by Alfonso Ribeiro. He was funny character. Everytime He appeared, there was some kind of funny things happened. Yes, by the today's standards, it's maybe cheesy but you certainly agree it's lot of fun, and I believe eighties will never duplicated.

I had many fine memories with eighties, and Silver Spoons was certainly one of them. If you're eighties growing-up kids, you'll love this dvd set. I can't wait to see those fun adventures with Rick and family, friends again after all these years. Thanks for reading.",1179878400,5,904,5.23448275862069

I watched this show when I was in middle school and it hasn't aged a bit.  Erin Gray is eye candy (I get to meet her in September at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention where she is a guest) and I only hope the rest of the cast helps with commentary or an extra documentary with the DVD.
