8224824,5,B000WOYSF2,"exactly what I was looking for.  If you're weak on legato, this is certainly one book you want for your library.",1437091200,,112,4.333333333333333
8224825,5,B000WOYSF2,"As always, Amazon delivers on time. I forgot I bought this dvd. I saw Stuart and Tom Quayle playing together and found this dvd in a drawer. Boy am I glad I bought it. I did not know what I was purchasing at the time and certainly did not know anything about legato techniques. I thought it was just an over used axe term. Now you are apart of my inside joke (laughing at myself).",1436227200,,380,4.08
8224826,5,B000WOYSF2,Awesome teaching for guitar learners from beginning to advanced- Highly Recommend,1432857600,,81,6.454545454545454
8224827,1,B000WOYSF2,"shows you five or six licks , moves them around the fret board and jams to a few tracks and thats it ??
Don't waste your money,,little or no technique except some basic runs,",1373932800,,174,4.147058823529412
8224828,5,B000WOYSF2,"I agree w/ Glyn Kidd above.  This is an excellent video.  While it delves in technique, it is far from dry.  When Stuart Bull demonstrates the lessons, he gives pretty much creative idea to even make the most rudimentary riffs interesting.  On top, he will lay out  some tasty  performances using the techniques learned from the lessons.
 Being a Lick Library DVD there is no tabs.  But the way Stuart goes over anything, tabs are Not Really Needed.",1296345600,,449,4.666666666666667
8224829,5,B000WOYSF2,"This is anohter Great Lick Libary DVD that gives you alot of cool licks and runs to add to your guitar playing arsnel. The way the instructor Stuart Bull presents the information was easy to follow.  The ""legato"" licks really spice up your playing. I would recommened this video to anyone looking to bring their guitar playing to the next level. Defently NOT one of those boaring Lead scales videos. Rated 5 Stars!!",1205366400,,415,4.684931506849315
