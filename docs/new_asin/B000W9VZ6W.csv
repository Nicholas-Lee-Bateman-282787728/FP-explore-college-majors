8221917,2,B000W9VZ6W,"I ordered this because I had visited Teotihuacan and wanted an informative DVD. I did not realize this was only ten minutes long. It does not have enough information and did not show enough of the site or its artifacts. It is not worth the money. I also ordered the other Teotihuacan DVD on Amazon: ""Teotihuacan: City of the Gods"" (EVN). This one cost more but is much better. It is almost 20 min. and although the commentary is somewhat ""dry"", it is very informative and more of the site an its artifacts are presented.",1232755200,3,520,4.484210526315789
