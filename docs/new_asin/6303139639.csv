7838564,4,6303139639,"This movie is within the same time an interresting overview of Russia during the nineties and a demonstration of the absurdity of racism. Pavel Lounguin has made an interresting movie that also allows the audience to understand the way the extremist's psychology may work. The actors are talented, and so is the director. It's just a pity that this film doesn't exist in a DVD format.",1142553600,,384,4.833333333333333
7838565,5,6303139639,"The story of two men struggling with their sense of identity: Nahum Heifetz, a relic of the failed Communist revolution, imprisoned in his apartment surrounded by memories of a Revolution that failed; Andrei,  young, angry and lost, trying to connect with the memory of a ""Holy  Mother Russia"" that never really existed. This unlikely pair are  thrown together by an unlikely possibility that they are related, and the  roller coaster ride is on as both men desperately try to sort out the  truth. Only by, literally, getting off the roller coaster of dreams,  illusions, regrets and folly and seeking refuge in a land usually  associated with exile, (Siberia), do both men find freedom and the ironic  truth. Excellent film-making by Pavel Lounguine. Oleg Borisov's portrayal  of Nahum is touching and hilarious; Andrei Goutine gives a powerful  portrayal of an angry, anguished young man. Loungine relieves the stress  and heartbreak of the story with humor; don't miss the curious explanation  the Young Thugs have for where the name ""Schwarzenegger"" comes  from, and Nahum's general slapstick will make you cry and laugh at the same  time.  Great film featuring great human beings, behind and in front of the  camera. Highly recommended.",958521600,6,1241,5.160804020100502
