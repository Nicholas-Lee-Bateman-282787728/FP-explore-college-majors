7835192,5,6303018181,"Great film from Iceland.  Since there is little dialogue, there are few distracting sub-titles.  We really can get into the two main human characters.  What plays behind them is the powerful character of the natural landscape of Iceland. Thus nature is a major player.",1492819200,,268,5.045454545454546
7835193,5,6303018181,I received my movie very quickly.  The condition of the tape was very good but I have not yet watched it to ascertain the quality.  I need to find a VCR so I can see how it plays.,1340668800,,179,3.6842105263157894
7835194,5,6303018181,"F Fredriksson's _Children of Nature_ clearly shows how much it is possible to say in cinema when a director chooses to focus his or her attention upon essentials, striving to tell a story without resorting to that sort overstatement and trickery all to familiar to audiences of typical Hollywood fare. There is nothing to find in its viewing which should have been left out. There is nothing wanted which must have been left out in its making that a viewer would wish he or she could see.
Portrayal of the elderly protagonists' simple human dignity did not preclude letting us come to know them through their foibles as well as their particular strengths. The spare and moving scenery of Iceland is not gratuitiously included. It is there to tell its part of the story. (One might even suggest that the landscape is one of the 'characters' in the film.) The situation which drives the story forward is commonplace enough, but it is given just sufficient push in the direction of the mystical and the humorous as to soften inevitable sorrow and grief with the only sort of hope an ironically 'post-modernist' era might bear.
Most of all, the story speaks plainly about the almost unbearable human cost of misplanned, onrushing change: Change now so commonplace, even in 'out of the way corners' of the world, that there is no escape, nor much hope of modifying its outcome, or negotiating a space to live even a brief span of years in peace--one can only refuse to go along, and pay the price of doing so.
(Of course we do not speak of how the wealthy must view the world, here. Wealth is to be understood, if it is to be understood at all, as the aberration it is, particularly when one marks the almost infantile renunciation of decency, restraint and responsibility displayed by those with the means to accomplish almost anything they could wish. Of course, with sufficient means, one can create almost any illusion of stability and sustainability.)
The scenes of embrace and of renunciation particular to the final moments of _Children of Nature_ bespeak of all that is best within the human spirit. The characters, from the first moments we see them, are anything but superficial or one-dimensional. The choices they must face are the choices we are going to have to face for ourselves.
I have not been so moved by a film in many years. This was so, even though I did not see it on the big screen.",1015804800,20,2401,4.691943127962086
7835195,5,6303018181,"Beautiful movie of how a simple dream can come true through love and dedication of ones life here on earth.  Photography is beautiful, story line is pure, lesson is true to the heart.
Two old souls who have become  prisoners to societies daily care, run away to find comfort in joining  there ancestors.  This will tug at your heart and soul, making you wish you  could find that one soul here on earth that is willing to grow old with  you.",962841600,7,441,4.382716049382716
