2525883,5,B000EOTF58,"A great, and often forgotten, American writer about American life on the praire.  Her style of writing is equisite, her words flow off the page and her stories extremely compelling.  She led a strong and unusual life and should serve as an example of the American spirit in that nothing can or should keep you down, that you can fulfill your destiny, everything is possible, even for a woman.  This American Masters program does homage to this exceptional lady in a wonderful way.",1183680000,24,480,4.759036144578313

8112369,4,B000EOTF58,"I found this 2005 PBS documentary on Willa Cather quite plodding and stodgy - especially regarding Cather's personal life - but it draws insightful parallels between her life and her books, and as such will be a useful resource for anyone interested in her novels, since Cather's best-known books are heavily inspired by her experience growing up in Nebraska. Unfortunately, it does fail to give us a good idea of what Cather was like as a person - in fact, the stodgy picture it gives is rather at odds with the personality that shines through her selected letters. The other thing that bothered me about the movie was the use of actors to reenact scenes of life on the Nebraskan frontier a century ago. I would have preferred being shown real artifacts of the time. But the movie does provide an excellent overview of Cather's most important novels throughout her life. Overall, I do recommend buying it. It will be a good purchase for anyone interested in learning more about Cather.",1488153600,,986,4.771929824561403

8112371,5,B000EOTF58,"I want this for Christmas as I am a lifelong Willa Cather fan and watched this when on PBS...BUT I am hearing impaired and need Close Captioning. Amazon site provides no indication on subtitles in English and/or Close Captioning.  Sorry, Amazon, you must research these issues as there are oh so many like me...folks with some hearing yet dependent on CC to fully understand dialogue.  I went to PBS website and found that it is listed as CC'd, and sent the info to Amazon w/website per your instructions. Now, I am hoping my husband will order for Christmas :)",1450224000,,561,4.656565656565657

8112375,4,B000EOTF58,"I wish there was more we knew about this woman.  The show was good and very detailed about her career, but I wish we knew more about her personal life.  No one knows if she was ever in love or had a lover.  It's a shame and yet I understand her need for privacy.",1392768000,,262,3.814814814814815
8112376,5,B000EOTF58,"The Willa Cather; The Road is All, documentary was wonderful. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Amazon purchases never fail to satisfy. I learned unexpected facts about Willa and gained a huge respect for the talented writer and woman that she was. Considering the times she lived, the courage she exhibited in her beautiful writings and how she indepentally lived her life was just amazing, brave and inspiring.",1376784000,3,424,5.159420289855072
8112377,5,B000EOTF58,"I have watched this DVD several times and think it is absolutely the best I've seen on an author's work.  The narrative helps you understand Cather through her writings, but also offers a very nuanced and wonderful account of the literary works in their own right.  I loved the way the consultants were able to bring in issues about Cather trying to find her own voice, the influence of the vast prairies on her psyche, the way she drew from her own experiences to write her novels, the role of her companions in her life, and her deep sense of loss as she lost them one by one.  The photography is perfect: lyrical, elegant, perfect for the works discussed. It matters that the photography was so well done to capture the texture of the prairies and canyons of New Mexico, the passage of clouds on the land, the billowing of grasses and the dappled sunlight on water in canyon pools because those all capture and parallel what Cather was trying to do in her writings about the land and the people in them.  I liked the fact that the film tried to bring to the fore Cather's struggle, indeed her love-hate relationship with the prairies.  I thought the consultants handled her nascent feminism and her sexual orientation very well without being heavy handed.  The way Cather challenged death and sought to know about it in her characters was also a striking feature of the elements brought out in the film.  I found the visuals, and the narrator, and the words of Cather read by Marcia Gay Harden altogether mesmerizing. The supplemental features gave me another level on understanding about Cather and her writings (how private a person she was, how she burned all her letters, etc), though they tended to demystify the visuals in a way I would have preferred not to know.  For example,(I am paraphrasing here): beyond this green billowing prairie shot is bustling Lincoln, Nebraska-- just over that hill there-- and it was extremely hard to find a patch of prairie to shoot. But this is a small thing in a work otherwise superb in every way.  An excellent purchase.  If you like Cather--or think you might--then this will really make you want to read her writings and to select which you would choose first. Her brilliance as a writer and the choices she made to offer an interesting narrative in her novels and short stories are all there in the film.",1365465600,12,2354,4.650602409638554
