8630842,5,B00H8EP9X4,"This is one of my favorite older pure barre dvd series - I also own mile high, lowry lofts, and flex. The studio series uses a towel only, which is quite nice for when you travel and don't want to bring any props. Very effective and challenging. I am comparing this to other dvds and not to the classes, since, as most reviewers have noted, the classes run 55 minutes longer and are much more diverse and difficult. I recommend this for someone who enjoys pure barre.",1505606400,,467,4.379310344827586
8630843,5,B00H8EP9X4,"I have to admit, it it feels a little silly using a hand towel as a prop, but it does an amazing job of helping to isolate the muscles you're working. This DVD has absolutely terrible production value, but it is VERY effective. Carrie NAILS good barre form, her instruction is great (upbeat, rhythmic, but not too perky or annoying), and the workouts waste zero time. She really crams in everything you need in the shortest amount of time possible. This particular workout is definitely challenging, even for a barre veteran.",1412812800,8,525,4.78021978021978
