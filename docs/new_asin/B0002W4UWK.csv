8100103,5,B0002W4UWK,"I found it in ""the bargain bin"" at the local store.  It was made on a low budget, however, I really liked this film and strongly recommend it for the whole family - our little Angelic friend tweaks us on the nose about about god, life and gives us a small dose of Puerto Rican politics hidden at the end.",1262995200,2,304,4.066666666666666
8100104,5,B0002W4UWK,"A little angel comes down from Heaven to search for God whom she believes has come back to earth. While here she encounters all kinds of problems from runaways to orphans to a woman that never leaves her room. She sees a world full of sadness and can't understand why God has let this happen. She keeps telling everybody she is an angle but no one believes her. She is adopted by a rich man who hopes she will be a comfort for his ailing wife. She begins to question her own sanity as to whether she is really an angle and if God really cares. At the estate she befriends an old gardner, a man she feels she has met before.

This is a beatiful film and very well done. Released on DVD by Image Entertainment the film is in spanish but you have the option of selecting subtitles in english. Photography and locals (Puerto Rico) are beautiful. A great film for the holidays or anytime of year, a treasure for the entire family. Enjoy!",1133913600,6,932,4.295454545454546
8100105,4,B0002W4UWK,"This movie is one that is very touching! Daniela Lujan (Luz Clarita) stars as an angel, who is looking for God. She does not understand why God is not in Heaven and she keeps on looking for him. She sings a few songs, and is just so very delightful. The movie is in spanish but there are optional english subtitles, which are truly subtitles that say exactly what is being said in spanish. This DVD also has a 35 minute behind the scenes special which is quite interesting and optional subtitles also for this. You will enjoy this movie very much!",1102032000,5,547,4.425742574257426
