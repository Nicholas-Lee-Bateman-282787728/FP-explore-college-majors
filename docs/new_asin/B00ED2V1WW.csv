As for the movie, the casting is spot-on.  The actors had a great sense of timing.  The script was written very well.  An alternate plot synopsis:  Our hero is a laid-back guy who meets the perfect woman.  She is a perfect cook, perfectly well-rounded, and seemingly perfect for him.  He soon realizes that she, though, has expectations (read nagging) that he simply doesn't.  She pounces on everything.  He prefers to let everything wash off of him.  He can't escape her, can't stand her, and can't imagine asking for a divorce.  A neighborhood Lothario might, however, help him get her off his hands, without any unpleasantness.  Hilariousness ensues.",1384300800,2,793,4.777777777777778

Given, on a flight that lasts 11 hours, anything will seem more entertaining, but after the fact, and a second watching, it stands up to proper scrutiny, and I feel comfortable recommending it.",1381536000,2,281,4.854166666666667
