5149751,5,B008CLI45M,"I got this movie for my sister as she is a big Sean Astin fan--but I liked it as well.  I've seen movies on the big screen that were not as good as this TV one.  Sean is outstanding as the ""average guy"" who encounters very NOT average events.  Everyone plays their parts really well. We've watched it several times, and have shown to friends.  Glad to have it in the family collection.",1353542400,,385,4.232876712328767
5149752,5,B008CLI45M,"I so enjoy thrillers like this one...gets the blood going and keeps you in suspense even though you may have seen plenty of movies of this type even on ""Lifetime"" the level of suspense is better. If you like suspenseful movies that do not present themselves as puzzles then you will enjoy this movie.",1350864000,,300,4.574074074074074
5149753,3,B008CLI45M,"Adopting Terror aired on Lifetime earlier this year, in which I didn't watch it because I don't care for most of the channel's programming. The movie was made by Asylum Home Entertainment, whom I have reviewed a few DVDs for this year, and they nicely let me view an online screening of Adopting Terror through Fordela.

The movie stars Sean Astin and Samaire Armstrong as Tim and Cheryl Broadbent, who are proud parents of their newly adopted daughter, Mona. Just when they are adjusting to being a family, a stranger shows up at Mona's first birthday party. The stranger is Mona's birthfather, Kevin Anderson (played by Brendan Fehr), who was released from prison on a technicality.

Kevin follows Cheryl while she is grocery shopping, he shows up at their house, and he even shows up at their friend's home to mow the yard. The police can't help them as there is no real proof that he is stalking them. The social worker, Fay Hopkins (played Monet Mazur), tries to give them advice on the situation, but nothing seems to helps as Kevin is determined to take back his daughter.

Desperate to protect his family Tim buys a gun despite Cheryl's objections, and he may have to use it as Kevin is not the only person who wants to take Mona away from them.

I can see why Adopting Terror first premiered on Lifetime before hitting DVD as it has the typical ""inspired by true events"" plot that most of the channel's movies are about, but the movie is slightly more intense than most. Typically Asylum's plots involve ghosts, zombies, disasters, sharks, or mockbusters, so I was surprised that the studio would release a melodrama thriller with actors that I have actually heard of. The movie started off slow for me, but the realistic plot kept me interested. There are a couple of twists that occur in the later half. I kind of saw the twist involving the social worker coming, but I didn't know if the writers would go that way or not. Despite a decent cast, the acting was average at best. There are of course a few plot holes that were probably caused by a rushed script. Like, why did the parents keep postponing the court date? And I guess the writers didn't know what a baby thermometer is. I'm still wondering how Kevin got out of the trunk of a car alive! Adopting Terror is not going to win any awards, but it is not as bad as you may think.",1348444800,5,2347,4.528301886792453
5149754,5,B008CLI45M,I saw this movie on lifetime and thought it was really good. I didn't get to see all of it and decided to rent it.,1388880000,,114,3.6
5149755,5,B008CLI45M,This movie is one surprise after another very suspenceful. I was deff thrown a curve ball when finding whom the child's true parents were.,1378598400,,138,4.791666666666667
5149756,1,B008CLI45M,"What a waste of time this movie was. I even regret the amount of electricity I used to watch this movie. This by far has to be the worst Lifetime movie I have ever seen. The character's were shallow. At first I thought that the adoptive mom had a speach impediment, but then realized it was just the way she spoke. Also, her hair was so thin that you could see the wallpaper designs through her hair. The acting was terrible - to the point that even the baby was annoying. This is one of those movies that you wonder who gave the movie the ""green light"" for it to be produced, and how drunk were they. The adoptive father was a complete twit. There were so many unrealistic scenes in the movie and just the whole storyline seemed absurd. No research was done. I would have rated this movie as ""0"" stars, but I had to put in at least ""1"" star - and that in itself is far too generous.",1371081600,,883,4.1395348837209305
5149757,5,B008CLI45M,"Really liked this movie.  Kept me on the edge of my chair.  Sean Astin was wonderful in his role, as were the supporting cast members.",1369267200,,134,4.32
5149758,3,B008CLI45M,I liked the movie to a point. It  will do if you like lifetime movies. And I do. So it will do for now. Save your movie and only rent at the redbox you'll be glad you did.,1366156800,,171,3.5
5149759,4,B008CLI45M,"I've always liked Ashtons movies, he was great in Rudy and great in adopting terror. First off, the picture quality is amazing , not all blu-rays are created equally, however, with this movie  it scores high on my list. Second, the plot was good as well; very suspenseful and a few twists in the film that made it interesting.  I did like the biological father as well, he kind of reminded me of a junior level terminator seeking his biological daughter.  However, the adopted mother could of played her role more intense, at times you kinda got the impression that she was imitating her expressions and emotions.

overall I would rate this a very good film too watch.",1364860800,4,668,4.635593220338983
5149760,3,B008CLI45M,"This movie was ok.  Seem like this plot has been done too many times.
Still worth watching if you have 1.5 hours to kill.",1360540800,,121,4.041666666666667
5149761,5,B008CLI45M,I really enjoyed this movie as it was full of suprises and drama. About half way through the movie I figured out the plot and still it did not take away from the ending!,1358640000,,169,4.0

5149763,4,B008CLI45M,"Many of the movies produced by Asylum are schlocky hodgepodges involving zombies battling sharks or some such ludicrous combinations, so I didn't have very high expectations for this film. But it's actually fairly well-done and starts from a realistic premise.

Sean Astin does a good job portraying the typical American father, bonding with the little girl that he and his wife have just adopted. Brendan Fehr is good as an ominous counterpoint, a dark figure intent on reclaiming the child that social services took from him.

The film has some surprising plot elements. These no doubt take flight from the ""true story"" that this material is supposed to be based on. But that doesn't matter. The result is an involving suspense story.",1356998400,2,736,5.024590163934426

8526783,5,B008CLI45M,I love the movie and i`m glad Tim & Cheryl adopted Mona and i`m glad the court granted custody of the baby to them instead of Kevin i think Tim & Cheryl are great parents to Mona & Mona`s so lucky to have such a good Mom & Dad who care about her and lover here and who adopted her and Mona loves her parents too and i can tell there all 1 big happy family the end.,1496620800,,364,3.6794871794871793

8526786,5,B008CLI45M,"With these budget DVDs that started out as TV movies, you never know what your going to get quality wise.  It's always a gamble, but you're only paying a couple of bucks so it doesn't really matter.  Some are terrible, some are slow and boring, most will have a former TV star or movie actor who is long between gigs, most will be watchable, but every now and then you come across one that is truely entertaining.  Adopting Terror is a fast paced nice thriller.  Granted it does have some unrealistic scenes, and factors like someone just won't die and keeps coming back like any staple horror/thriller movie from the 70/80/90's did.  But that adds to the fun of this type of genre.

Adopting Terror's most recognisable actor from the past is the adoption agency head guy, played by Family Tie's dad Michael Gross.  He's not time wise in this a lot but it's nice to see he's still around.  You'll also recognise Sean Astin if you were a child of the 80/90's (Goonies, Toy Soldiers), if you're a bit younger than that you might recognise his voice as belonging to a giant green turtle with ninja skills called Raphael.  Astin plays Tim, the new first time adoptive father of a baby that was rescued from a hotel room where the father shot the social worker.  Unfortunately for Tim and his wife Cheryl, that social worker entered the biological father's room without permission, so he's out of jail on a technicality, and he certainly doesn't recognise the decision of the court to give his baby to someone else.  Her new parents of course aren't prepared to give her up either.

I think this is a fun movie, it's a thriller where you can work out what is going on before it plays out, but that doesn't mean you don't enjoy the journey there.  There's plenty of stuff that wouldn't happen in real life such as the court scenes but that doesn't matter if the film is fun. It's also a film that has you thinking if you were in the adoptive parents situation what would you do?  You've got to wonder if at the first birthday party in the park if the couple had just said great to meet you (even if they weren't thinking it) we're happy to have you be a part of her life if you like, (knowing he'll probably end up in jail again soon anyway) if the whole events wouldn't have turned out safer for everyone.",1449360000,2,2300,4.432304038004751

8526790,3,B008CLI45M,"One of the things you can count on with Sean Astin is that he will give you a great performance no matter how lousy the script or dialogue. This is a made for TV Lifetime film with the expected quality. Tim (Sean Astin) and Cheryl (Samaire Armstrong) adopt a bay girl. The film implies Tim has some male issues.

Along with the baby girl, they also get as a bonus the murderous biological father (Brendan Fehr) as a stalker wanting his bay back, one that the state took away. The action builds as expected, including the Lifetime twist.

Lifetime fans will love it. I am less enthusiastic.",1401321600,2,589,4.4953271028037385
8526791,1,B008CLI45M,"I hate adoption because of what it does to real families.  Sicko movies like this make the real families look like nuts, crazies, lunatics, criminals, murderers...and that taking the baby of someone who is in trouble is ok.  People need to think!  Trash like this, brainwashes and removes the thinking that needs to be done!  Even if someone is in jail...in no way does that mean it is ok for the courts or whomever to take that person's baby and give the child to someone else!  Doing that creates a situation of lies, broken relationships, and severs the opportunity for the child to deal with reality, and for the parent and child to work out their relationship for better or for worse...as even marriage cannot compare to the bond that a mother/father and real child have.  Don't be fooled by this TRASH!",1389744000,,808,4.654929577464789
