8680057,5,B00NT964XG,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and just recently found out about Sid the Science Kid. Where have I been? The first episode I watched was the whale episode that discusses non standard measurement. Wow...perfect for classroom use! I love how with each episode, it gives the children (and adults) an easy way to experiment that episode's concept. The concepts are explained in detail on an appropriate level. The DVD itself came in great condition. Great series to introduce your child to scientific thinking!!!",1523750400,,505,5.096385542168675
