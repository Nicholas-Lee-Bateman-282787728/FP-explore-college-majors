8000757,3,B0000DE6A0,THe video was good but very short.  Too bad they didn't put more songs by the artists on it.,1481241600,,92,3.8421052631578947
8000758,4,B0000DE6A0,"THE ORIGINAL JUNIORS [minus DANNY] : R & R is here to stay / Twistin' USA / Sometimes When I'm All Alone [aka Sometimes] / At The hop.
LENNY WELCH: Since I Fell For You / Breaking Up Is Hard To Do
FRANKIE FORD: Roberta / Alimony / Sea Cruise
DIXIE CUPS: Chapel of Love / Iko Iko

Great video-audio; hard edits. Great camerawork. Wolfman Jack and pal on the scene with less than inspired patter.
All performances are worth revisitation as the singing, dancing, band is jut5s fine just fine > Nice surprises: Twistin' USA; Alimony; Breaking Up Is Hard To Do [not listed on jacket!]; plus extra nice, long set by the Dixie Cups.",1382140800,,625,4.387931034482759
8000759,1,B0000DE6A0,"When I received this tape it was not Bobby Vee & the Shirelles.  It was a tape of singers I was not too familiar with.  In 2007, I saw Bobby Vee in concert along with one of the original Shirelles and really wanted to see a tape of early performances.  The vendor did apologize and stated that the ID number showed the name as Bobby Vee and the Shirelles and offered to either take back the tape (I would have to pay return postage) or give me a discount on another tape. I kept the tape because the cost of my time and postage to return wasn't worth the effort.  This is the first time I was disappointed with Amazon.",1178668800,6,618,4.125
