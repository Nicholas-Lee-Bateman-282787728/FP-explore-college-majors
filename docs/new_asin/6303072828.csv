I ALSO THAT IT WAS LITTLE BIT WARD AT FIRST, BUT MORE YOU GOT INTO IT YOU LIKED IT. I THOUGHT IT A CRIME THAT PBS  STATIONS PULLED THE SECOND VERSION OF TALES OF THE CITY AND WOULD NOT SHOW  IT.

I myself live in San Francisco, I was a real life Mary Ann Singleton.  What I truly love about Tales is how  all these different character make you care about and want to go with them  to their life process.  I especially love Mrs. Madrigan, Olympia Dukakis is  wonderful.  Hopefully they will start doing the third installment with the  original actors from the first.

What makes this miniseries so awesome is that Director Alastair Reid adapted the story SO faithfully to film, that the there was NO reduction in story quality from the original newspaper series from the San Francisco Chronicle from the mid 70's. If you relate to, or have an interest in mid 1970's San Francisco (or the 70's in general), this is the best 6 hours you will spend following the characters in this story.
Unfortunately, I cannot provide anyone with a source for a better quality DVD but, this may be as good as it gets, since the DVD originates from the '90's. GREAT story line and ardent fans can even trace the places (on a map!) where the characters patronized.",1484352000,3,853,4.439490445859873

555503,5,6303072828,"This is the first of three installments of and amazingly well written, well acted and well represented story numerous characters whose lives intersect in a large metropolitan city (San Francisco) during the late 1970s. I did not live in San Francisco at that time, but moved there later in 1988 and I can assure you that this story and the amazing acting are as true-to-life as could be during that era. This was the most successful ever series originally produced by PBS... Which did not continue due to pressure from the radical religious right. Censorship from religious groups have interfered with creative expression throughout time and this has cost us dearly in losing original storylines, characters and scenes to accommodate a loud minority Mae West was another example of censorship which she claims helped her become famous (true), but we still lose because much of her true creativity probably fell in the editing room and we will never know the original stories, great acting and representative values of the era lost forever due to censorship suppression of The first amendment. Just the same, Mae West co-wrote or independently wrote much of the screenplay and dialogue for a number of her movies and you can see what a genius she was in braving the censors as far as she could. You have to admire her and this is only one small example. Definitely enjoy this great series Again and again!",1460851200,,1404,4.878661087866109

I still remember being shocked by the steam room scene.. I recommend it now and tomorrow. It's a great piece of drama... and who would have thought that the seemingly overwrought bit about race in america would play out in real life in 2015???

555509,5,6303072828,"A funny and heartfelt coming-of-age of story about people living and exploring free love in 1970s San Francisco. I bought two copies of Tales of the City as gifts for friends, and the miniseries is just as entertaining and fun as I remember it. The only downside I can give this is the grainy VHS look to the footage. I'm used to crisp and clear images on a DVD so it was a little odd seeing VHS quality footage for a DVD release.

Other than that, it's great! I love it! And I'm sure my friends are going to enjoy it as well. If you enjoyed Tales of the City I recommend checking out More Tales of the City and Further Tales of the City.",1443052800,3,638,4.104

555568,5,6303072828,"I loved the original Tales of the City all those years ago when it first appeared on PBS in the 1990s, but only saw it that once. I was delighted when I found I could purchase this set of DVDs. Twenty-plus years later, I found the shows just as charming and delightful! The series, of course, is based on Armistead Maupin's stories/novel set in the San Francisco of the 1970s, and is full of wonderful characters, quirky and not-so-quirky. All of the actors give great performances, although Olympia Dukakis as Anna Madrigal is my favorite. If you ever need a good ""1970s fix"", this, the first set of tales, you need to watch.  I also very much liked ""More Tales of the City"", although I saw shifts toward more gratuitous graphic sex in that series as it was apparently taken over production by Showtime. ""Further Tales of the City"" became even more sexually graphic, to the point of almost losing the humorous and quirky story lines, and I found it not as good. Oh, well, Tales of the City, the ORIGINAL, is still wonderful and I will watch it again and again in the future. I highly recommend it.",1432425600,,1098,4.517587939698492

I love this set, and despite what people are saying, the back of the video cover says ""unedited edition & Recommended for Mature Audiences"", and IT IS (unedited)..

I have to say, the packaging is a little disappointing but it's acceptable and as I have yet to watch it, I hope the swear words have not been dubbed over as in the original. They were left in the Channel 4 UK version but dubbed over on the USA version.

The shock I had was  the amount of customs/handing duty I had to pay. I have not had to pay this for a dvd before from the USA so I feel that the amount of 13.68 (including a Royal Mail 8.00 handling fee) was somewhat surprising.

555965,1,6303072828,"An excerpt from my review of this new Acorn 20th Anniversary DVD of Tales of the City:
full review here:  [...]
When Tales was first released, it was banned on many Southern U.S. PBS stations. It seems so tame now compared to reality TV. It has since been heralded as one of the best mini-series ever produced. It is a joy to watch and re-visit my friends at 28 Barbary Lane. Laura Linney in particular is a dream as Mary Ann Singleton. So many great guest stars and of course there is Maupin's world where gay, straight, bi, confused, black, white, transgender, rich, poor, old and young all thrive in a world he experienced in 70s San Francisco which we are a little closer to attaining in some places in 2013. I tear up every single time Mary Ann walks through the gate for the very first time and sees the house that is 28 Barbary Lane and will become her home for many years and the occupants her family.

All that said, you can imagine how disappointed I was in this edition when I realized Acorn not only hadn't spent a dime re-mastering anything, the new DVD actually looks worse than the VHS tapes did. We live in an era of larger digital televisions. But even the simplest of sets would show a grainy, washed out Tales of the City that looks more like it came from old Polaroid snapshots of the 70s rather than sophisticated television recording equipment of the 90s. I'm horrified they are marketing this version and suggest no one buy it unless you must have a copy of this and can't wait until another company decides to restore this masterpiece. I'm writing both Acorn to tell them how disappointed I am and Criterion to ask them to open a television division. Maupin's Tales deserves the Criterion treatment. Acorn's done him wrong. I'm still giving Tales of the City a 5 out of 5. Just be wary of this new version for poor picture quality.",1377820800,105,1855,4.469026548672566

I believe the VHS tapes that were released were of a higher quality.  I have all the versions that have been released on DVD and this is still the worst quality version.  Save your money on this version and wait for a company to secure the rights to this property and do it the justice it deserves.  I am a die-hard fans of Mr. Maupin's works and am terribly disappointed on this ""20th Anniversary Edition"".  SHAME YOU ""Acorn Media""!!!!",1377648000,15,661,4.615384615384615

Unfortunately this so called ""20th Anniversary Edition"" is nothing of the sort. It is the same horrible, washed out, noisy VHS quality that the original DVD's were.

This series deserves to be restored as it is one of the best mini series I have ever seen. From the story, acting, cinematography, to the score, ""Tales of the City"" engages viewers with an interesting, exciting, and fun ride. The film itself is 5 out of 5 stars.

This lame repressing of a badly transferred DVD does not however. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Blurry and noisy PQ, no black levels to speak of, washed out colors, and more (or should I say ""less""?).

Why did Acorn video even bother? I'll tell you why:

To try and sucker the true fans of this amazing series with the same unacceptable picture quality and sound as found on the original release of this series many years ago.

556034,3,6303072828,"I absolutely love this mini-series (as well as the book it's based on). When it first aired on PBS in January 1994 I was instantly smitten with it's zany cast of characters, overlapping plot lines, and wickedly wry sense of humor. So if I love this mini-series so much, why only give it a 3 star rating?

1.) Picture Quality
The 2003 release was on 3 discs and very grainy. This new 20th Anniversary Edition is only on 2 discs. No way the picture quality will be improved unless Acorn Media actually spent the money on re-mastering the original print.

2.) Bonus Material
Due to the grainy picture quality mentioned above, the only saving grace from the 2003 release was the behind-the-scenes location and rehearsal footage (as seen on the original PBS airings). This 20th Anniversary Edition features the exact same bonus material. Nothing new here except for the audio commentaries on episodes 1, 3, and 6; as well as an 8-page booklet. Could they not have done interviews with the cast and crew to honor the mini-series' 20th anniversary?

3.) Un-Cut Version vs. Original Broadcast Version
I contacted Acorn Media about whether or not this 20th Anniversary Edition would be the same edited cut (previously released on VHS in 1994 and DVD in 2003) or the original broadcast version (previously released in Region 2). Their reply was that Acorn Media only has the rights to the edited version (available in Region 1) and Channel 4 Distribution has the rights to the uncut version (available in Region 2).

At the end of the day, this 20th Anniversary Edition just doesn't have enough to make me want to ""double dip"" (especially since I have a region-free bluray player and the Region 2 release is just fine for me), however, for those who missed out on the 2003 Region 1 release -- which is long out-of-print and going for over $100 -- this 20th Anniversary Edition should be a nice treat.",1373760000,25,1890,4.735562310030395

I especially enjoy Mr. Maupin's ""six degrees of separation"" style. For the most part each character is connected to another even though they may not be aware of it.  This is even carried into his other books. For example in Night Listener, Mr. Noone's assistant originates in Tales.

I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the transfer.  Having played it through my HD projector and through my TV, the picture quality is dreadful, full of noise, highly visible in brighter scenes rendering it almost unwatchable.

I sat through the first disc and needed to rest my eyes.  I wonder if the company doing the transfer was using equipment from  the 1970's to transfer to DVD!!

Whilst I appreciate that these DVD's did not cost the earth, they should be of reasonable quality or there should be some notice of what to expect.  I have had better quality DVD's from the 99p bin at the local supermarket.

There is a brief appearance by Parker Posey, whose character exemplifies the ""gotta get some hot stuff"" attitude of the 70's.  There's a very typical relationship of a gay man and a straight woman in it that I thought had elements of realism to it, speaking from experience.

Tales of the City captures the flavor of the 70's in a fun, kitch-y, sensational way.  It also pokes fun at the fads of the 70's.  The plot has intrigue and mysteries, and the characters all have secrets.  It is very true to the books, so if you are an Armistead Maupin fan, you will most definitely appreciate it.  If you are not yet, try him out for a little brain candy.",1174262400,,1417,4.428571428571429

556264,5,6303072828,"""Tales Of The City"" is an honest and very entertaining story about life in the big city in the late 70's. This review contains a spoiler for those of you that aren't aware of the complete premise of the series.

Leading the cast is Olympia Dukakis as Anna Madrigal the very hip eccentric land lady with a secret. She grows her own marijuana , has a plethora of advice and loves her tenants like they were her own children.

Also starring 2 time Oscar nominee Laura Linney as the nave Mary Ann Singleton who moves to San Francisco from small town America.

Chloe Webb as the confused self proclaimed fag hag in love with the handsome gay Michael Tolliver a transplant to San Francisco from Orlando Florida (used for plenty of fruit jokes) played by the adorable Marcus D'Amico.

The cast also includes Thomas Gibson, Billy Campbell, Barbara Garrick, Paul Gross and The wonderful Donald Moffat.

The acting is fabulous, Dukakis is the shining star in this series, her portrayal of Anna Madrigal is so honest and heartfelt that you totally believe her in this role ,I personally never like it when a genetic woman plays a transgendered woman but she makes it work by not going over the top or exaggerating the character of Anna.

She gives her class, a sense of belonging and dignity while making her seem somewhat vulnerable yet giving her that slight rough edge that comes along with the journey she has traveled.

This series has a little of everything for everyone all amidst the beauty of San Francisco.

And whether it's edited or not it's one fun ride.",1165968000,7,1556,4.653284671532846
556265,5,6303072828,"Like many gay men, I've known of Armistead Maupin for ages but I still haven't gotten round to reading ""Tales Of The City"". It's on my wish list but for some reason or the other, I keep deferring it.

I was more keen to see the DVD though. I remember when it originally aired here on Channel 4 back in the day and again, for some reason or the other, I didn't get round to watching it then either. I'm sad to learn that the DVD may actually be edited in terms of the dialogue but then, since I never heard the original dialogue and am yet to read the book, I can't say it makes much difference.

It's a wonderful story. I know it's a wonderful story because, while I was rather surprised to find out that there are only six episodes on this DVD, I didn't feel short-changed. Indeed, I can't wait to get my hands on ""More Tales Of The City"" now. There is a dark side to the narrative but all in all, it gives a very idealistic view of what life might have been like for people, (especially gay people), in San Francisco in the late 1970s. I don't know if it's an accurate portrayal or not, I wasn't there, but I don't really care about that much either. ""Tales Of The City"" is first and foremost a work of fiction. So I can watch these characters, listen to their dialogue and observe their lives and wish. Wish that I had been there at the time. Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's the sunny San Francisco climes, maybe it's pure wishful thinking but I get the impression from watching this, that the 70s were a much more innocent and less cold time and that San Francisco was the place to be.

Olympia Dukakis is a phenomenal actress but all the principals here - Donald Moffat, Laura Linney, Marcus D'Amico, Chloe Webb, Thomas Gibson, Barbara Garrick, Billy Campbell and Paul Gross give heatwarming performances. Another purchase that is worth every penny.

It says ""Recommended for Mature Audiences"" on the back of the DVD box but I'm not sure why. There are no gratuitous sex scenes here whether they be heterosexual or homosexual and personally, I think this is why every gay man (or lesbian) should see this at least once. I think it's useful to know that great stories about gay people can be told without gratuitous sex.

Not that this stopped the outrage and hysteria that accompanied the original release of this mini-series in the US. Apparently, the sight of two men kissing on TV led to all kinds of nonesense up to and including a bomb a threat at a local PBS station. But that's another story.",1164499200,7,2505,4.413419913419913
556266,5,6303072828,"I first caught part of the series on Bravo during their ""Out of the Closet"" festival, so talk about dialogue being edited...all the curse words were bleeped out, so I was not aware of dialogue being changed from the original PBS broadcast to this DVD edition, until reading reviews by others here.

While it is unfortunate that the series was not presented as the original PBS broadcast, it was such a pleasure for me to see a full, non-bleeped out, commercial-free version of the series on DVD. I also enjoyed listening to commentary presented by Mr. Maupin, Laura Linney and Olympia Dukakis.

Interestingly, Armistead Maupin makes an Alfred Hitchcockish appearance in the film--watch for him. (Maupin is a fan of Hitchcock's; Hitchcock's influence upon Maupin's work is apparent here but especially apparent in ""More Tales of the City"", another great DVD.)

It is a loving portrait of 1970's San Francisco, a San Francisco that no longer exists. I find myself yearning to be a resident of 28 Barbary Lane every time I watch this series, as I would dearly love to live in San Francisco but can't afford it. The acting is superb, especially Olympia Dukakis as Mrs. Madrigal, Laura Linney as the wide-eyed naif Mary Ann Singleton, Chloe Webb as the spaced-out trippy hippy Mona Ramsey. Other fine performances include Thomas Gibson as the spoiled, manipulative Beauchamp Day and Marcus D'Amico as the sweet, looking-for-love Michael Tolliver. Donald Moffat is outstanding as the crusty but vulnerable Edgar Halcyon. And Stanley DeSantis manages to invent a new definition of ""CREEPY"" as the weirdo Norman Neal Williams. The cast of characters lend so much color and texture to this magical tapestry woven into the heart of 1970's San Francisco; you'll find yourself watching this DVD over and over again.",1154995200,6,1803,5.043624161073826

556330,5,6303072828,"This TV series and its sequel are the epitome of quality programing.  I loved Armistead Maupin's story when it first aired on television way back when with a dynamo cast.  Having arrived in San Francisco myself in 1975 I absolutely empathized with the series main character, Mary Ann Singleton (she is so naive!).  The acting is top notch and the character developments are thorough.  The various plots take twists and turns that will surprise the viewer, but in the end it all turns out well for the characters we have grown to love (Mary Ann, and the gays, lesbians, transsexuals and the other normals).  I absolutely adore this enchanting and sweetly mischievious ride through San Francisco's mid-seventies.  You will too!",1126828800,6,725,5.0
556331,5,6303072828,"Back in 1995, I was still in the closet. One night, flipping channels in the televisino in my bedroom, I happened upon what appeared to be a movie. Two characters, talking on a beach about life, were suddenly visited what appeared to be naked people. Of course, being young, my interest was peaked, and I was introduced to life in the late 1970's, in San Francisco. For the next few nights, I'd steal away to my bedroom and secretly watch the happenings on Barbury Lane, with awe and fascination. Thus was my introduction to ""Tales of the City"" and a watershed moment in my own life.

""Tales of the City"" is the ingenious brainchild of Armistead Maupin, who wrote it as a serial for the San Francisco newspaper. Mary Ann Singleton (Laura Linney), an Everygirl, moves to San Francisco from her sheltered life in Ohio, and has her eyes opened to the world. Moving into Mrs. Madrigal's (Olympia Dukakis) towering house of apartments, Mary Ann meets and mingles with the residents, a cross section of the best of San Francisco.

The story weaves and meanders through the lives of the people, and their intersections are often unique and surprising. The meetings of different characters are all within a believable context; and each develops more as a character upon these meetings. Whereas the story takes prominence in the mini-series, the acting is superb. Linney and Dukakis turn in incredible performances; Linney never falls into sappiness with her innocent Mary ann, and Dukasis is rich and layered as a landlady with a secret. Also, Marcus D'Amico performance as Mouse, one of the gay characters, is both heartwarming and endearing. Mouse has a heart of gold, fails to fall into any set stereotypes, and finds himself already on a quest for relationships and love in a time where those two words were vile.

Whereas the miniseries in and of itself is amazing, the effect on me was even moreso. Directly because of this show, I was able to see myself in a different light. I was presented with a positive images of gay people, and therefore, began to realize the importance of being myself. Maupin's work to dispel stereotypes, while entertaining us, truly was personally revolutionary for me.

Edited or not, the DVD collection of ""Tales of the City"" is one that will remain in my player for years to come. Every once in a while, when I'm feeling alone in the world, just pop in an episode of this incredible series, and visit my friends at Barbury Lane.",1123027200,11,2457,4.76056338028169

A. This collection is a lesson in fine, subtle, and overall masterful acting. The performers brim with intellect (their commentary shows their analyses and hard work) and psychological nuances.

B. It's wildly entertaining, with constant wit, some camp, mystery, and a whole lot of loving characters that are a joy to follow. I personally would readily marry any one of them: Mouse is incredibly cute, Mona is sweet, and Mary Ann is like the audience's bridge into the mythical world of 28 Barbury Lane.

C. It's an important statement on accepting who we are and who others are and finding that, despite our unique, perhaps, skin-deep differences, we all share common ground (symbolically as the tenants share their living space).

D. Laura Linney is one of the best, most convincing actors of her era. Olympia Dukakis is remarkable and gorgeous in her truly tour-de-force portrayal of Mrs. Madrigal.

E. It's a beautiful ode to San Francisco (with stunning location shots), the 1970s, and living out life in general.

F. It had me staying up 'til wee hours in the night so I could finish all 6 hours and, despite symptoms of sleep deprivation, it has been an immensely satisfying watch (despite brief falls into soap opera-ness that are redeemed by the dazzling performances).

There should be more TV like this; the world would be an infinitely better, more intellectual and loving place. If ever you get a chance to read or view this breathtaking work don't pass it up, it may change your life and your perception of other people's, but most of all you'll be compelled to dance in white boxer briefs to funky music and invest in an ornament for your, ahem, tree.",1090540800,10,1724,4.843537414965986

The package from Accorn Media is extremely well done and offers lots of extras.
The video quality is very good and exceeds the quality of my off air copies by a long shot. One can see the different film speeds on the DVD, where as on video, you don't due to the so, so resolution of VHS.
I like how they kept the three episodes seperate, like the original series, sans the American Playhouse intros. I liked the special features, especially the behind the scenes footage and the shots of the set being built for the first time. It's interesting to see how the set was constructed, much like a real place along with commentaries by Armistead, Laura Linney and Barbera Garrick etc.
But most of all, I enjoy the story tremendously and have the entire 6 book series in paperback to read at my leasure. Armistead's writing is supurb and I like how the first book was adapted, almost verbatim to the small screen - a rare feat in any case. I love the shots of San Francisco, how the story tells of the 4 main residents (a straight female orig. from Cleveland, a lesbian/dyke/former hippie/fag-hag, a gay male and a womanizing straight guy) of the fictional 28 Barbary Lane apartment and their Landlord, Anna Madrigal (a transexual male to female) and how they all struggle to make a family unit out of their shared experiences living there. I also like how the other characters, especially the Halcyons, who own an ad agency in San Franciso intertwine within the story and the trials and tribulations of Dee Dee Halcyon Day and her arrogant husband Beauchump. While the characters are both gay and straight, Armistead, who's gay himself didn't write just for a gay audience, but for ALL audiences.
I won't go into all the details but suffice it to say, it's a great addition to one's DVD library and is all contained on 3 DVD's in a fold out case.

Which is why I buy it, take it home and wait for one of my favourite scenes. Finally Brian picks up Connie Bradshaw at the Laundromat and I'm waiting for that wonderful post-coital confrontation.

556404,5,6303072828,"Thanks to writer Armistead Maupin, 28 Barbary Lane has become one of the most famous addresses in San Francisco; but it is fictitious.  The address is the location of an apartment building created by Maupin when he began writing a fictitious weekly serial called ""Tales of the City"" for a local San Francisco Newspaper called the ""San Francisco Chronicle"" in 1976.  After 13 years of weekly installments, Maupin converted them into a collection of six books.  The first book, named ""Tales of the City"", was turned into a 6-hour TV miniseries by the BBC in 1993.  When it aired on PBS in the U.S. in 1994, it caused quite a controversy not only for its honest depiction of gay characters, but also for showing men kissing one another and frequent drug use.  The story's main character is the eccentric owner/landlady of the apartment building, Mrs. Anna Madrigal, played by the very talented Olympia Dukakis.  Mrs. Madrigal is a free spirit choosing to live life to its fullest, including the growing of marijuana that she shares freely with her residents.  Her residents are also a very interesting set of people including Mona Ramsey (Chloe Webb), Michael 'Mouse' Tolliver (Marcus D'Amico), Mary Ann Singleton (Laura Linney), Brian Hawkins (Paul Gross) and Norman Williams (Stanley DeSantis).
Taking place in the mid-1970's, the story begins with Mary Ann deciding to remain and move to San Francisco while visiting from the Midwest.  She finds an advertisement for an available apartment at 28 Barbary Lane.  She goes there, meets Mrs. Madrigal and immediately moves in.  Mary Ann then finds a job as a secretary for the very wealthy Edgar Warfield Halcyon (Donald Moffat), who also employs his son-in-law, Beauchamp Talbot Day (Thomas Gibson).  Beauchamp's marriage to Edgar's daughter, Deirdre Denise 'DeDe' Ligon Halcyon Day (Barbara Garrick), is rather dysfunctional with both engaging in extramarital activities.  Mona also works for Edgar Halycon, but gets into trouble with her outspoken views.  Mona and Michael, who is gay, become very good friends and spend a lot time with each other.  Over the course of the story, ties between many of the residents of 28 Barbary Lane and their common acquaintances (but not necessarily known) are shown.  One of the common acquaintances is Dr. Jon Philip Fielding (Bill Campbell), who is De De's gynecologist, but also knows both Beauchamp and Michael.  Other well-known actors played minor roles in the miniseries including Ian McKellan (known more as Gandalf in the ""Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy), McLean Stevenson (known more as the bumbling C.O. Lt. Colonel Henry Blake in the 1972 TV series ""M*A*S*H""), Rod Steiger (known for many roles including Komarovsky in the 1965 film ""Dr. Zhivago""), Swoosie Kurtz (played in the 1988 film ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and Janeane Garofalo (played in the 1997 film ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"").  Armistead Maupin also makes a brief cameo appearance as a writer in a window.
Overall, ""Tales of the City"" was very well done by the BBC and I rate it with 5 out of 5 stars.  Sequels to the series were made later, but not all of the original actors reprised their roles to the disappointment of many fans.  The two actors most commonly missed in the later sequels are Chloe Webb and Marcus D'Amico, whose roles as Mona Ramsey and Michael Tolliver were replaced by Nina Siemaszko and Paul Hopkins respectively.  Admittedly, the chemistry that existed between Mona and Michael with the original actors in ""Tales of the City"" did not come across as effectively with their replacements in the sequels.  Of the two miniseries sequels, the first (""More Tales of the City"") is better than the second (""Further Tales of the City"").  Each is based on the second and third of Maupin's books.",1048636800,37,3780,5.0144

With time has come perspective, and this merry six-part adaptation is a faithful and funny rendering of the intersecting lives of the residents at 28 Barbary Lane -- and certain other denizens of San Francisco.  Loads of fun, this series boasts turns by then-unknowns who later became stars (William Campbell, Jeanine Garofalo, Ian McKellan), not to mention Olympia Dukakis, who plays Mrs. Madrigal to perfection.",1048464000,,791,5.124031007751938
556463,5,6303072828,"I've been waiting for this to show up on DVD since the format got introduced... as a naive gay man coming to S.F. during the 70's, I think Tales of the City is one of the most accurate descriptions of what it was like to be here during that time.  The people, the clothes, the music, the Quaaludes, the attitudes are totally right on target.  It's a great series and still leaves me with kind of a wistful feeling and a lot of great memories.  BUY IT, you'll love it!",1048032000,2,467,4.166666666666667
556464,5,6303072828,"The story begins with the first chapter - Tales of the city, as Mary Ann Singleton, a nave and young lady from Cleveland falls in love with San Francisco and decides to stay. As luck would have it, she finds an apartment in an old house on Barbary Lane, where the landlady Anna Madrigal welcomes her tenants by taping homegrown joints to their doors.
The story throughout miniseries (which contains 3 chapters: ""Tales of the city"", ""More Tales of the city"" and ""Further Tales of the city"") revolves around the carefree and chaotic lives of tenants residing at 28 Barbary Lane. As characters are slowly unraveled we discover all the happiness, all the sadness, darkest secrets and shocking relations that will keep you laughing and reach for tissue at the same time.  There is something for everyone. I have never meat anyone who watched this miniseries and did not love it. Hair, clothes, mood rings. Life so full and simple it will make you wish for it.",1047859200,2,954,4.712574850299402

A super movie. Buy it..you won't be unhappy with it. The only other thing I can add is Christopher Sullivan's review hit the nail on the head. Way to go Chris.",1046304000,,335,3.9411764705882355
556466,5,6303072828,"I remember back around the year 93 or 94 a co-worker of mine urging me to see this.  I resisted thinking I would hate it.  I finally relented thinking my co-worker and I had very similar tastes in film & television and if she liked it how bad could it be.  So I took the tapes home and one night when I was really bored I popped it in.  Well I cannot tell you how entranced I was with this story and its characters.  I almost couldn't stop watching.  It's very addictive....trust me.  In fact, the story is so good and its characters so true to life that it makes you yearn for a place like 28 Barbary Lane in San Francisco.  I wanted a landlady just like Mrs. Madrigal and friends like Mary-Ann, Brian, Mouse, & Mona.  And now finally the dvd release of my absolute favorite mini-series of all time.  I guess there is a GOD!!!  There are also some nice features included with the series which is great.  So if you find yourself on the fence debating the cost of this purchase allow me to steer you in the proper direction in making a decision.  Buy this dvd now!!!  You will not regret it.  And in case you need any more arm twisting, you'll also notice that of the 21 reviews posted every single one of them rated this a 5.",1045785600,6,1225,4.1752136752136755

I bought the other DVDs in the series as soon as they were released, and now I am so thankful they went back and did the original so I can add it to my collection. This series is a must-have.",1043971200,,360,3.628205128205128
556468,5,6303072828,"I have always have been a fan of Maupin's books so when they were made into movies, I was thrilled to see them.  They didn't disappoint.  The story is fascinating and well-acted with great cinematography.  It's a great adaptation of Maupin's words.",1002067200,2,248,4.857142857142857
556469,5,6303072828,"I can't believe its taken me so long to get around to seeing this classic TV miniseries! Based on Armistead Maupin's novel of the same name, the show  intertwines the lives of a diverse group of 1970s San Fransiscans, who all  gravitate one way or another to Mrs Madrigal's magical house at 28 Barbary  Lane. The early episodes are fantastic as the characters are introduced and  you want to know how they will develop. In later episodes the plot thickens  and it becomes imperative to know whether the goodies will attain their  heart's desire, and whether the baddies will get their come-uppance. The  final episode contains some great denuements, which are unpredictable but  entirely credible. The script, the acting, the filming and the theme music  all combine to create a sense of romantic melancholy which remains just the  right side of sentimental. This might well be labelled melodrama, but if so  its a shining example of the genre. My favourite details are the fleeting  glimpse of the real Armistead Maupin, typing away at a window overlooking  Mrs Madrigal's, and the cameo appearance of Country Joe McDonald, starring  as an aging hippy (!). He plays his famous Vietnam song completely  oblivious to being ignored. Priceless... For the information of those  reading the other reviews here, I suspect that one reason the show is so  good is that it's a co-production with Britain's Channel 4. No-one else has  mentioned this, so I thought I should. Its not just a question of  'commercial' TV versus 'publicly subsidised TV'. Channel 4 is a commercial  company, funded in Britain by advertising.  I guess it comes down to what  the public in our respective countries is prepared to accept on TV. In the  States it seems that 'good', 'moral' rubbish will get aired with no  problems, while creative programming that says something about the truth of  a diverse world runs the risk of censorship. In the UK Tales of the City  was certainly less risque than much TV drama. A recent example would be  'Queer as Folk'. Any chance you've seen that in the US? I think not. Must  finish this review now, in order to read all six of Armistead Maupin's  Tales...",965174400,10,2167,4.8283378746594
556470,5,6303072828,"Having been born and raised in the City in the 60's and experienced the sexual revolution of the 70's full blast, working in many of the clubs, mentioned or eluded to, this series was as close as one can expect from the  media to expect from the mainstream. Daily everyone in downtown amongst the  secretaries talked about Tales in the Chronicle. It was a time when we all  judged each other a lot less...and adventure awaited you each nite...for  better or worse...it all seemed so innocent...and it was. Some lived hard  during these times...and others like me are healthier and happier that I  was there in the 70's full blast in SF and I learned from it without it  wearing on me. I loved every day then as I do now. There was an air of  mystery every night just as Armistead expressed...and nothing I have ever  seen has seen even tried to communicate the MOOD of SF in the 70's...I  always called even unto today with friends there..the ""processing  center"" where burdened souls like Mary Ann come to blossom...a well  done portrayl...if your soul cries to relive this era for the joyous  freedom...without the bother of good and bad...but learning...or to see  what all the fuss is about the magical SF 70's...again without  judgment...this is as close as you are going to get unless you can rent  Stargate and reprogram it to send you to the 70's. Only those whose heart  lived in SF 70's know that if you were a nightbird in those days that this  for mainstream productions came close to expressing the way it was.",964742400,3,1523,4.598513011152416

Both of us spent the first 20 minutes wondering if we should change channels but found ourselve paralized to the screen. The more we  watched the deeper the spell of mystery and adventure. The occasional  graphic nature to sex and drugs only intensifies the spell. If only all  dramas could be so well written and acted.
We have purchased the videos  and enjoy them more with each viewing. It is amazing how much new material,  clues and adventure pops up with each showing.  This is our best video  collection. Let's hope the sequels continue.",958694400,3,627,4.636363636363637
7836796,5,6303072828,"Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City was serialized in the San Francisco Chronicle years ago when I lived in SF.  It's a much different city now, not for the better.  Even if you never lived in SF this is still a marvelously entertaining and beautifully produced kind of soap opera with a twisted, wonderful storyline and great characters.  The cast is first rate with Laura Linney, Olympia Dukakis, and others creating indelible characters in locations that I remember well, when SF was a hotbed of creativity.  I've watched Tales of the City many times over the years and still find it fascinating.  There's not a wasted moment.  What can I say?  S'marvelous!
