5879053,5,B00DYEBLY8,This is something that people that play world of warcraft will get a laugh out of. Found it to be witty and spot on.,1387756800,,116,3.875
5879054,5,B00DYEBLY8,"Although, I'm not a MMORPG Player in the traditional sense, I do write RP stories in thread forums. I think I have met all these characters online already, so watching this series is so apropos. I have to say I think Felicia Day (A.K.A. Codex) is hilarious. I think I have felt the frustrations she relays to the viewer often while in the online forums. This is a great series just for the cool geek factor and the screwball comedy aspects. I would recommend this to anyone who laughs at those taking online gaming a little too seriously and to fans of situation comedies. Thanks.",1387497600,2,580,4.533333333333333
5879055,5,B00DYEBLY8,"If you are like me and enjoy web shows this is the show for you. Felicia Day has created the perfect show that brings awkwardness and friendship and gaming all together in one great funny show. Now you can own all 6 series or seasons of The Guild. This dvd collection comes with tons of special features that will be sure to please the biggest fan of the show.

I highly recommend this show cause it's fun and deal with a lot of subjects from friendship to relationships to sticking together as a team. There are also a host of guest stars in the show as well. So if you are looking for a gift for someone that loves gaming and also loves to laugh, then this is the ultimate dvd collection for you or them.",1387411200,3,706,4.1911764705882355
5879056,5,B00DYEBLY8,"I was extremely saddened when I went to watch this on Netflix and they no longer have it available for streaming.  This is the kind of show that I love to pull out every once in awhile (mostly while gathering in my own MMO) and just laugh and enjoy.  I couldn't think of a thing I really wanted for Xmas, so this box set was my one request... I no longer have to rely on whether or not Netflix is streaming it, plus I get to support the creators.  Awesome sauce!  Can't wait for Santa to come now!

If you enjoy playing MMO's at all, you'll definitely enjoy watching these!

5879057,4,B00DYEBLY8,"Who doesn't love The Guild?  This is the greatest set ever for the money.  Wish they would put it out on blu ray.  I would recommend this set for anyone, but be warned it is very short.",1386115200,,185,3.945945945945946
5879058,5,B00DYEBLY8,"Love The Guild, Love Felicia Day, Love gaming?  Then this DVD set is for you.  All the episodes, music videos and behind the scenes and outtakes for anyone.",1385856000,,156,4.535714285714286
5879059,5,B00DYEBLY8,This is a great show. It is very well written. The casting is perfectly spot on. I highly recommend it.,1383955200,,103,4.2
5879060,5,B00DYEBLY8,"I'd known about The Guild for a while, but only recently got to see the entire show. Alright... so I binge-watched it end-to-end over two nights this week --- aaaaand also while at work... probably when I should have been, um, working. What can I say? It's a hilarious show, the cast is brilliant, the story lines and dialogue are funny, and everyone seemed to have great chemistry. This is the kind of show that you wish would just go on and on forever.

As a former professional game designer and producer and lifelong nerd (somewhat reformed-ish), The Guild has pure nerd authenticity written all over it, but you don't have to be a nerd to love its charm. Great shows have characters that people can laugh at and laugh with, and The Guild has it in spades. A true original, it's six seasons of laughs and fun.

And I probably shouldn't mention that I have a crush on Amy Okuda who plays Tink in the show - that'd be a really weird nerdy online thing to admit in a Amazon DVD review, wouldn't it? Yeah, that'd be pretty nerdy... ummmmm... (nervous look around)... quick! Go buy The Guild DVD box set on Amazon right now!",1382400000,11,1123,4.446601941747573
5879061,4,B00DYEBLY8,"This is a funny and well made romp through the lives of the players and their characters.  While ""The Guild"" has many references to World of Warcraft, anyone who has played online games will recognize the player types presented in these episodes.",1381104000,,246,4.857142857142857
5879062,5,B00DYEBLY8,"This is a MUST SEE for anyone who has played (or is still playing) World of Warcraft. Created from Felicia Day's true life-account of being formerly addicted to the game, it is chock full of WoW-type references. Not to say it isn't a GREAT show for any nerd/cosplay/video game addict/etc out there, you just may miss some of the World of Warcraft-specific references. Not that it detracts from the show, but if you get the ""inside"" jokes, it's even funnier. And I guess a fan of any MMORPG will get most (if not all) of the gaming references anyway. All of the characters are very believable (probably because Felicia says they were based off of real people she knew)and funny. Felicia's quirkiness and the way the series is shot in a sort-of webcam-like style fit the show perfectly. Rough edits/segways make the show even more believable. This is proof that not every AAA blockbuster-type show must come from some formulaic Hollywood studio. Felicia and Co. have truly pioneered this genre and I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this DVD set to support what they have done!",1380758400,3,1070,4.820652173913044
5879073,5,B00DYEBLY8,"I discovered this show in 2014 and was instantly hooked.  This show is a must for gamers, especially if you ever played any type of mmo. It's spot on for everything game related.  In one scene, they were in the game and a GM shows up and everyone just starts talking to the gm like you would see in an actual mmo .  Then the gm showed off his powers and everyone is amazed.  The show also covers all today;s current game problems such as mmo's going free to play, trolls on the internet criticizing the game, inflation in mmo's, etc.  I have to watch show at least once a year, sometimes twice.  It's very short, a total 6-7 hours.  You can still catch it on you tube but i wanted to get it on dvd to support the actors in hope that they will someday make the guild 2.  Highly recommend if you are a gamer!",1487203200,4,806,4.089171974522293

5879080,5,B00DYEBLY8,"If you have never had the pleasure of watching The Guild, stop reading this immediately and go purchase this box set. You can come back and post a thank you later. If you have already seen the series, what are you doing reading reviews?  Scoot. Go buy. Share with friends.
Felicia Day is her usual quirky self, making it impossible not to adore her. The show is funny and a neat peek into the world of role playing and role players. I myself am not a role playerI married into a very well established geekdom and several fandoms. I may or may not have been sucked into more than a few of them, this one included. And I am glad.
So, what are you doing still reading this? Go buy it. And while you're at it, pick up the complete season of Firefly. Again, you can thank me later.
PS I guess I do have a couple complaints....the day before I bought this it was $20 bucks cheaper. Sigh. I need it for a birthday surprise so I paid it, knowing that the series is worth every penny. However it ticked me off a bit. And the print quality leaves something to be desired, but that is a small concern. Lastly, there wasn't any kind of inserts in the box. Not a big deal, but I kinda was hoping for one for her to sign when we meet her next week.
Edit: We did meet Felicia and she is the kindest, funniest, sweetest person ever!",1460937600,,1316,4.1607843137254905
5879081,5,B00DYEBLY8,"I had not seen The Guild before this, and so for those who have also not watched this wonderful series before, here is my description: You know that book you like that you wish they would make chapter by chapter? That is what The Guild is like. Each episode is a short (maybe ten minutes?)  little blurb of action, and each episode begins with Codex (Felicia Day) speaking candidly into her webcam about what is going on in her life and that of her Guild members. Each season is 12 episodes long, which makes a nice little movie of the thing, so it was pretty good binge-watching material, in my opinion. I am not a gamer, but I certainly know people who are, and I feel as though I know understand their insanity much better.

These misfits characters will win you over, and I could not decide which character was my favorite. although I do confess that I don't have children because I feel as though I would be a Clara-type parent.

The bonus has lots of interviews and other goodies if you enjoy behind-the-scenes peeks.",1456963200,,1023,4.489247311827957
5879082,3,B00DYEBLY8,"I'm not a gamer so the premise for this series was lost on me. I do like Felicia from when I saw her in Supernatural so I took a chance. Gamers will probably appreciate it ,ore than I ever will.",1451692800,,194,3.875

5879088,5,B00DYEBLY8,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like The Guild, because I can't say I've ever played a RPG like World of Warcraft.  However, as a fan of anime and manga, I figured I would give it a shot.  I am so glad I did!  The Guild is a really great web series.

5879090,2,B00DYEBLY8,"So, the episodes are good.  Fantastic even.  If the DVDs worked, this would be a five!

The problem here is that the DVDs are nearly unwatchable.  2, 3, 4, and 6 all failed to play correctly.  The start of every episode would usually either freeze or go into fast forward.  So I had to rewind, and hit play again, and hope that my second (or third or fourth...) attempt to play would work out for me.

Even if it did work, I usually missed the first few words of her monolog into the webcam because the video was silent.

I eventually was able to make it through all the episoes, and I was happy the pain of the DVDs was over.",1425340800,3,626,4.115702479338843

Anyone who starts watching it doesn't stop. This series is awesome and you shouldn't pass up the opportunity to see it if you haven't already.

The earlier seasons were very much shoe-string but the production improved as it went. Even still the first season (which is only about 40 minutes long when cut together) is engaging and clever. Don't just take my word for it. You can watch all of the seasons through Felicia Day's channel Geek & Sundry on YouTube.

You can truly see how much momentum the original show picked up, as the quality of filming, acting, execution and elocution improves drastically as you progress through the show.
