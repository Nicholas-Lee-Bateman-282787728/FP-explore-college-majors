7761722,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The hero/villain, known only as V, is a modern `rendition' (pun intended) of Guy Fawkes, the man who was captured, tortured, and confessed his part in attempting to blow up the British Parliament building in 1605.  V recites the following poem amongst many others throughout the movie:  ""Remember Remember, the 5th of November, Gunpowder Treason and Plot.  We see no reason, why Gunpowder Treason, should ever be forgot!""  However, the movie is neither a justification for the Catholic rebels of 400 years ago nor a condemnation of the King James administration, which was also a target of the Gunpowder Plot.  Perhaps I can best summarize V for Vendetta as an examination of the proper place in this world of those who would say, ""We need hope, not buildings"" or ""Ideas are bulletproof.""  Are such idealists too dangerous to be tolerated?  Do natural rights or even constitutional rights prohibit pre-emptive prosecution of thought crimes?

Political philosophy is always a mix of the real and the ideal.  So what better venue than a comic-book inspired movie to provoke more questions than I could even enumerate in a simple movie review--questions concerning the role of citizens, the power of government, the justification of violence, retribution, toleration, propaganda, etc?  Moral issues presented in V for Vendetta range from unquestionable acknowledgement of the existence of evil in dystopian government controllers to more relativistic and difficult-to-grasp concepts that many viewers might never have even doubted before watching this movie.  Then again, much of what you take from this movie will depend on ideals you hold going in.  If you are only looking for narrow applications to specific current events, you will find them.  But if you limit yourself to such analogies, you will be missing out on the abundance of vital topics presented this movie.

A student of Zen training methods may appreciate the direct personal experiences that Evey (Natalie Portman) must endure, while other may resent them.  One familiar with Eastern concepts of `Self' may not be so concerned that V never removes his mask or rarely even his gloves throughout the entire movie.  The Self is no more a face or flesh and bones than a State is its capital building, is it?  An Existentialist may have a better appreciation for the ultimate freedom of overcoming fear and saying, ""No"" even to ones own existence when the alternative is decidedly intolerable.  If you appreciate philosophy in general, or political philosophy more specifically, or if you've enjoyed books like We, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, or Brave New World, you will enjoy V for Vendetta.  But of course no prior knowledge is required to enjoy this action-packed and thought-provoking movie.  I suspect it will stimulate many discussions and perhaps even an interest in further reading.",1142812800,,2845,5.170305676855895
7761723,4,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie in not so subtle tones explain how a government creates a fake terroist attack to instill fear and patriotism into its people.  Hmmm, just like the true story of 9/11.

50 percent of New Yorkers now believe that the government knew or was involved in the 9/11 attacks so they would have a reason to wage war and take away civil liberties.

7761736,3,B01GJQM5JM,"This is not classic literature. It's a lot of two dimensional comic book treatment of how to portray a would be early 20th century anarchist uprising in a 21st century world. It has a lot of the delayed adolescent anti-authoritarian anxiety like found in ""The Fight Club"" - enough macho violence, but not too gory to turn mainstream audiences off.  Oddly, it is anti-government, but not anti-capitalist. This will wait for the remake, Son of V, before Portman gets too old.",1533945600,,473,4.839506172839506

7761744,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I would give a six if it were possible. Not so much for the movie itself, but for the message that it brings. Tyrants exists because people allow it. We put our lives first, but in the grand scheme of things we are insignificant. What is significant is what we do. If you see that something is wrong, your duty is to do and say something about. By that I DO NOT MEAN attack someone just because you think that you believe is the only thing that matters. Pay attention to what the movie kept mentioning: a Civil War happening in the US. That was the first domino, in this movie, the direct cause of what happen in England. The true enemies of the people want that to happen. Don't be a puppet.

When we think we are standing up for what is right, are we in fact part of the evil, are we willing to see what is most important, even above our own life. Are we willing to share our world with those who feel strongly, but differently? Can we let others who see things differently be themselves, as long as they don't impose their will on ours?

Take heed. Though the story is from a graphic novel and seems completely imaginary, this is how the governments of the world in future will try to remove your freedoms. It's happening already. And 10 years from now, 20, 30, who knows how long but the government will want all of you.

 It may be under the guise of a terrorist attack, disease, complete monetary collapse, financial breakdown of civil order - maybe all of the above.

Your freedoms will be taken by an ever-growing government. Will the people roll over and sacrifice their rights for their perceived safety?

Today Romeo and Juliet is often cited as a love story rather than a ironic drama. V for Vendetta somehow went from being a movie about the dangers of anarchy and authoritarianism yet somehow became the poster child for both. There's a lot of cool and silly moments as to be expected from the people from The Matrix, yet there's also a deeper political question that is up to such interpretation that there are many different things to take away from the movie. That is both its high point, yet also leads to a very divided fan base.",1494633600,,710,4.427480916030534

7761877,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is another one of those awesome flicks that flew under the radar and didn't cause shock waves until it made it to cable. Although the cast does a kicka$$ job, it's the message that makes this rock. Ironically it came at the beginning of the Obama regime, and that's probably why we paid no mind. A socialist regime pursuing goals of ideological supremacy and political correctness, persecuting the opposition as instigators of hate crimes...sound familiar? Using man-made catastrophes to further their agenda, they establish themselves as society's only hope. What can we do but trust and obey?

Hugo Weaving is the anti-hero known as V, an anarchist waging a one-man war against the totalitarian government led by Adam Sutler (solid job by John Hurt). Outside of Evey Hammond (great work by Natalie Portman), the cast is full of two-dimensional stock characters reminiscent of those in ""John Wick"", good guys and bad guys who stand on either side of a hard line. There's the villainous Lewis Prothero, sympathetic Gordon Deitrich and face-turn Eric Finch (Roger Allam, Stephen Fry and Stephen Rea respectively), all of whom help build a great plot that grows on you until you stand and cheer at the magnificently orchestrated (!) final reel. V stands for Vendetta, and it's one man's crusade until the people of England decide that they're not gonna take it anymore.

It's a social statement that found its way onto the streets of NYC where Occupy Wall Street activists were wearing Guy Fawkes masks. You're not gonna find another cult classic that made this kind of impact in recent memory. Treat yourself to a cultural event and pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.",1484784000,,1681,4.957446808510638

Overall, I consider it an excellent movie.  However, it is quite violent, so it may not be appropriate for all audiences.

I do believe that  teens could benefit from many of the ideas presented here, possibly around ages 14 and up I would guess.  The world is way too full of brain dead zombie consumers.

And to make it worse,  I had to buy it through YOUTUBE to be able to make it through. Just terrible.
~Edit: After processing my review, Amazon Customer Service did refund me in total. This brought the rating up to 4 stars, from the initial 1 star. I won't give it 5 stars, just because I'm not sure if they can adjust the audio quality, though the Representative did say they would forward the note to those who are in charge of that.

7761955,4,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie is primarily an anti-government film. It takes place in London. So for those who think this is an anti-American film seriously needs to re-take American History, READ the Declaration of Independence, and understand WHY we celebrate the 4th of July!! This film is Very PRO-American considering our foundation is Liberty and Freedom from Government.

Unfortunately, this film reflects what Europe and (especially) America are struggling through right now. Corrupt Politicians, State (biased) Media, and a population of SHEEP!! So Scary!!!

Overall this film is entertaining. There are some ""campy"" moments but overall good.

I still don't understand why ""Anonymous"" would choose this character. The character ""V"" used violence to defeat his enemies...for example. (*However...to NOTE: It does reflect the age of this group of people considering cult movies are ""generational"". Mine was ""The Crow"")

Even though Anon has shed truth in Politics; sites like Wikileaks still fails to deliver on the significance that Revolutions (against a corrupt Government) are mostly won through actual WAR not ""Scandals"" which seem to be their only ammunition.

7761967,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I was hesitant to re-watch this for some reason but finally did and I did not regret it.

This movie is especially powerful right now as the premise is that England was scared of Muslims and gays and the whole nine yards and elected a power hungry, inexperienced, bigot and narcissist that turned the country into pretty much 1984. That's just the backstory, the movie mostly follows a dude that was terribly wronged by said leader and comes up with a 20 year plan to end it. Natalie Portman randomly gets involved.

It's a good movie for the message alone (which is, don't give power to a power hungry, inexperienced, weasel who's campaign feeds on hate and fear). Hugo Weaving does an excellent job as V (you never see his face) and there are handful of cool fight scenes and a few good explosions but nothing like you'd see in a blockbuster these days.",1477526400,,855,4.545454545454546

7761986,5,B01GJQM5JM,"A deliciously dark and bloody tale of revenge against the fascist establishment.....
The World is in turmoil, in America - Civil War - in Europe - ravaged by a virus....
Britain in the 2020's is ruled by force, it's a place where those that appose the system are imprisoned and indeed
executed......However there is one man 'V' (Hugo Weaving) who had in the past suffered the wrath of the system
but lived who is determined to fuel a revolution by his quest to bring down the totalitarian regime headed by the
uncompromising  'Adam Sutler' (John Hurt)
'V'
These days in Britain there is a curfew in place, 'Evey' (Natilie Portman) a TV-Station employee trying to visit a friend
the date 4th November is intercepted by the secret-police, however before they have their way with 'Evey' the masked
-avenger 'V' rescues her....after which he takes her to his home, where from the rooftop she witnesses  the explosive
demolition of 'The Old Bailey' accompanied by the '1812-Overture' blasting out throughout the capital and a dazzling
firework display.
'V' tells 'Evey' that in one years time he plans to do what 'Guy Fawkes' failed to do in 1605, blow-up Parliament, he also
insists that she stays at his home for the 12 months leading up to the event.
Strangely the unassuming 'Evey' and the sword-wielding masked avenger do develop a great understanding ....
Whist 'V' works through his list deserving his vengeance, Chief Inspector 'Finch' (Stephen Rea) comes under increaing
pressure to foil 'V's' activity.
'V' see's 'Evey' as an ally but will have a need to seek proof of her loyalty ahead of his intended finally ...will she prove
loyal ?
'Finch' will learn of the true nature of their glorious leader and will question where his loyalty should lie as he closes
in on the identity of 'V'?
Will 'V' achieve all he had set his sights on ??
A superb Comic-Book style blood-letting roller-coaster ride....well worth a re-visit or indeed a first viewing.

The movie itself is one of my guilty pleasures.  The story's stage is set to show the ills of an all powerful government.  That theme is something everyone should be aware of.

Anyone who supports free thought and is resistant to a tyranical government will enjoy the movie.  Everyone else will be annoyed and Natalie Portman's performance.  Her accent is a little annoying from time to time.",1472256000,2,696,4.68595041322314

7762057,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I have become addicted to this movie, more for the internal transformation that takes place in Evey, the Natalie Portman character, than for the wider social and political commentary it offers.  She begins as a fairly timid character who becomes absolutely fearless by discovering her ""last inch"", the only essential part of being fully human.  I've not read the graphic novel it is based on, and my nephews tell me ""the book is better"", but the story in the movie is absolutely fabulous and the performances are outstanding!",1459468800,,525,4.954545454545454

7762124,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Although this movie is centered around a highly skilled and intelligent rebel, it is hard to imagine one person capable of arousing a nation to revolt like this movie portrays. On the other hand, how else is a revolution fomented and the masses of the people catapulted into action? I think the script is excellent if a bit wordy at times, but the points made are telling. If for no other reason, viewers need to watch this movie and compare to what is happening in this country right now. This portrays an open tyranny yet it does show what one remarkable individual can do to enlighten the population to do something about it. Move over 1984, this movie is just as telling and clearly a warning.",1453507200,3,697,4.5396825396825395

7762143,5,B01GJQM5JM,"What everyone seems to overlook about this movie is the love story... it's a very subtle background story, but it's extremely powerful once you recognize it. Having seen this movie at least a dozen times, it is now openly obvious to me; however most people only see the main plot and never examine the beautiful relationship that builds between V and Evey. That he is willing to give up everything - even risking losing her - to give her what she most wants (""...not to be afraid""), and the depth of emotion in the final scene, how can anyone deny that part of the story...?

Yes, this is from the graphic novel... and no, it was never intended as a love story... but if Hollywood is going to mess with a story, then this is how it should be done... take a great story... make it real for the viewer... and add an almost hidden background story to reward the vigilant...",1450569600,,870,4.403726708074534

In comparing the film to the graphic novel, I much prefer the film. Even though the subject is ""dark"" the acting, photography, and overall presentation of the characters and issues was gripping and stunning.

I didn't resonate with the Matrix triology or Jupiter Ascending, but this is a film I find myself going back to repeatedly to harvest more insight into what a totalitarian regime looks like and the extent it will go to, to preserve its hold on the populace. I am glad I bought the Blu-Ray version. The extras and special features really add to the experience.

However, if we were to have a fascist state in the West, it would certainly be a left-wing police state, not a conservative Christian theocracy-like police state.

Voltaire  'To find out who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize.'

Virtually all the media in the West (except for Fox News and talk radio) propagates left-wing ideas. This movie presents a police state run by Christian conservatives who lock up gays, Muslims, ban the Quran, etc. The truth is that Islamic supremacists and leftists in the West are uniting to suppress freedom of speech by introducing hate speech laws.

Read Dennis Prager's 'Tolerance, Health and Fascism' short article, it will give you tons of examples as to how leftism is bringing us close to fascism today.",1445731200,,1036,4.830508474576271

7762231,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Although the man behind the Guy Fawkes mask is never actually revealed, James McTeigues V for Vendetta still captures the attention of any drama enthusiast. The film puts the viewer into a world where a corrupt government strips every bit of freedom away. The setting, characters, and plot of the film all contribute to the quality of the production James McTeigue creates. The terror and fright this film provides my yet come true in real life.
The film takes place in the late 2020s in a fascist England, where a supreme chancellor rules over the land. Due to a time of war and conflict, the people find security through their government. However, this government, corrupt with greedy officials, is all about power and dominance over its people. The pure complexity of the situation is enough to draw any curious viewer. The situation is relevant even in todays society. People all around the world struggle for freedom from their governments, and that exact battle is what James McTeigue puts it viewers through in this production.
There is no doubt the character we are all eager to meet in the movie is V, acted out by Hugo Weaving. The well educated, sophisticated, vile, revenge seeking, vigilante somehow comes across as the hero of the story. From the get-go, V introduces himself with the famous V speech. Hugo Weavings presentation stuns the whole audience with his verbose intellectual rant that, for those who do not know, mostly contains words that start with the letter v. V is a character that uses his words in a way that inspires others to join in his revolution. He acts in a sophisticated manner, however uses violent measures to obtain what he desires. This kind of behavior is exactly what makes V such a mysterious enjoyed character.
The puzzling plot unwinds in a manner that seems impossible for any viewer to disengage from the story. While the government continues to abuse their power and strip away freedom, citizens of this nation start to question their loyalty. The audience finds itself tangled up into this difficult situation as if they were actually going through what the citizens are. For example, when a majority of the nations citizens rally in their Guy Fawkes masks, any viewer dives into the action and roots for the revolution. All humans strive for justice and freedom and this is what the citizens and the viewers have in common. This connection between the mere idea of revolution and viewer is exactly what makes this drama film so great.
James McTeigue really did a number on this piece. Drama films are meant to capture the viewers interest and make them feel for the characters in the film. V for Vendetta not only interests the audience, it ends with a big bang and leaves viewers awed.  Even though we may never know what V actually looks like, this film still gets a big thumbs up.",1443657600,,2835,4.7975460122699385

7762252,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Superb on all levels, film making at its best. The dialogue, the cinematography, the philosophical themes, the suspense, the intricate plot. Themes of destiny/fate interwoven with the rise and fall of civilizations. Harkens a bit to the philosophy of Giambattista Vico (or at least reminds me of him; think about Vico's chaos stage of civilization and how it pertains to the chaos that V feels impelled to create in the film) This is a film that everyone in the 80s would have understood, but nobody in the 80s would have been able to make because things needed to transmorph beyond that era first.

Amazing and spectacular.

Of particular note are: John Hurt's face on a huge room sized screen, even the people in his cabinet never see him face to face, ruling with an iron fist. The occasional odd, futuristic gadget or weird thing that pops up, and the way this is potrayed with camera shots that are reminiscent of the movie Brazil. And the acting by Hugo Weaving was outstanding. Always covered in a mask and cape, he nonetheless through a tilt of the head, through posture and mannerisms was able to perfectly convey meaning. He made the mask assume its own personality.

I don't know whether to give it four or five stars. I feel it almost deserves five, but I tend to reserve 5 for such masterpieces as great potrayals of works of literature or groundbreaking films. So I'll give it  a 4 or 4.5",1441152000,,1402,4.641129032258065

7762256,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I would like to start off by saying that I do not think V for Vendetta is the perfect movie, it is far from that. What it is, however is a very enjoyable movie, of course adapting a movie from a revered source material is always fraught with peril. V for Vendetta due to the scale and the complexity of the narrative was going to be almost impossible to encapsulate into a 2 hour movie. The basic essence of the original comic I think remained intact and I thank the producers for that, the fact that Alan Moore wanted his name not mentioned is a mute point. His 2 works of genius Watchmen and V for Vendetta will always remain classics, the less said about the dogs breakfast The League of extraordinary Gentlemen has become the better! The complexity of his writing makes it almost impossible to do them justice and yes point in case From Hell and The League of extraordinary Gentlemen are testament to this point, they were abominations as movies!

I have always felt that V for Vendetta would have made a brilliant 6-8 hour  mini series, that would have given it the scope, the range,  to explore the complexities of the story and would have allowed the minor characters of the source material to have their time in the spot light.
With that I mind I beg you all to indulge me, after seeing the original movie I pondered who I would have cast in the series if I was one of the producers. For those who have read the original story bear with me, for those who have not then please do yourself a favour, go out and read it and then you will know who I am referring to.

Here goes : It would have to be a fully United Kingdom production so the BBC would have to be the producers.

Director Danny Boyle
Script writers Alan Moore (if his majesty agreed to do it ) and Jimmy McGovern.

7762260,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""Remember, remember, the fifth of November
Gunpowder, treason and plot.
I see no reason why gunpowder, treason
Should ever be forgot...""

Those words above have got to be some of the most dramatic, most combustible lines ever set to poetry. Each year I attend the Anarchists' Ball, an aphorism of V's remains the password to get thru the door (else it's a $10 entry fee): ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" I first read Alan Moore and David Lloyd's 1982 joint, V for Vendetta, when I was a kid, and I remember, remember it for the disorienting mind-fvkc of a read that it was. 2005 released the equally discombobulating film adaptation, and I remember, remember it for rendering me unsettled and fidgety and pondering. The plot has everything to do with an anonymous anarchist freedom fighter named ""V"" who strives like mad to ignite an uprising against the fascist government that suppresses a near future, dystopian United Kingdom. ""England prevails"" is how the High Chancellor, top-of-the-food-chain villain, ends his every speech, but V is about to test that. On a more personal, put-a-face-on-it level, it's everything to do with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a working class bird who unwittingly gets caught up in V's rebel movement.

Don't get tricked: this isn't an action picture, never mind that V does get to exhibit his flair for asskickery. No, this is more a subversive character study or a scathing social commentary or a provocative political allegory. Maybe you'll get lulled by how V cuts such a tormented, romantic, swashbuckling figure, and lulled by how magnetic and persuasive the voice, and how oh-so-mysterious he is behind the signature Guy Fawkes mask. The movie makes V more palatable for the audience than ever did the graphic novel. Alan Moore kept him an enigma thru and thru whereas the movie peels off some of the baffle. Ergo, the tie-ins to concentration camps and perverted experiments and mass torture and just all-around fvkcery. Man's hubris creeping up again.

Three principal actors rock this movie. Hugo Weaving is stupefying as V. The Guy Fawkes mask, you'd think, would hamper his ability to sway the audience. But he gives such an impassioned performance thru diction and thru sheer grace of physical movement that he easily becomes the film's most mesmerizing character. You sympathize with him even though he seeks to achieve his ends by means of murder, chicanery, and blowing sh-- up. Does he promote terrorism or provoke thoughts of liberty? V is perceived as heroic in part because his opposition - being the full weight of a police estate - is such a vast engine of oppression and censorship. The fingermen and the black baggers are some seriously vicious m0therefs. It's a miracle such  could produce such a thoughtful operative as Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), him what's been assigned to curtail V's activities. V is unquestionably the most showy figure, except the story actually revolves around Evey who becomes an even more pivotal character. Natalie Portman embraces an English accent and doesn't suck at it. She's our point-of-view person, and we track her evolution from pawn to victim to... something else.

The film resonates with its rich, sweeping visual palette. There's a dark, delirious, palpable neo-Goth vibe that I ate up. Couple that with an eloquent, tormented hero making bloody war against the might of a vile old England. There are mature themes and much exposition. There's Stephen Fry's small but memorable part. There's derring-do executed with operatic panache. V for Vendetta is articulate and disturbing and tragic and cautionary. Everything is presented at such a heightened scale that it's a challenge to relate to the characters, even Evey. Ultimately, its scope and ambition and sometimes dreary content may turn off a viewer or three. But I think it's a movie that you should experience at least once. It shouldn't only be anarchists and libertarians and malcontents who flock to it.",1439856000,,4035,5.079939668174962

7762268,5,B01GJQM5JM,"It's the future, and it's Great Britain. ""Undesirables"" have been purged from the country, to wit, in the words of the fictional, blowhard, government mouthpiece / TV personality envisioned by the Wachowskis, known as ""Lewis Prothero"", who pronounces to an audience of millions on TV, ""We did what we had to do. Islington. Enfield. I was there, I saw it all. Immigrants, Muslims, homosexuals, terrorists. Disease-ridden degenerates. They had to go."" In this nightmare future (although not that difficult to envision, unfortunately), America has economically failed, the Middle East went up in flames, and through nefarious methods, Britain has managed to survive, but at what cost(?), as the government is now controlled by a bombastic dictator. And how did that dictator manage to come to power, after all? And what does this have to do with the main character, a masked man / terrorist, known only as ""V""? The clever relationship forms the central plot of the movie, and, for any intelligent person, the details also suggest concepts that may be more firmly rooted in historical reality, than we'd like to admit. William Randolph Hearst once boasted ""You furnish the pictures, and I'll furnish the war!"" In that quote, some essence of the ""truth"" of this movie may be gleaned. This unique cinematic experience, from the minds of the geniuses behind ""The Matrix"" series, serves to remind us that, at times (maybe all too often), things are less of what we'd like to (conveniently) believe, than what they actually are.

7762284,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Critics call this movie unpatriotic or Anti-Christian.

This is the story of a Totalitarian Society. One where the Government can Black List anything. Where every career is a pawn of the regime. Where the regime can enter homes without cause or warrant. Where citizens can be imprisoned or executed at the whim of it's dictator.

V was captured and experimented on by that regime. Those experiments erased his memory and enhanced his physical speed and reflexes. Those experiments also created Bio Weapons that let the regime enslave V's country. After escaping V spent the next few decades planning and executing his revenge - his revolution against that regime. V was fighting to free his country. Nothing could be more Patriotic.

That regime destroyed most religions. What it did to Christianity was even worse. It reduced the Church to a Political Puppet, a farce of the Church, a Mockery of all Christ was. It even turned the Cross into a Symbol of it's political power, instead of a sign of Christ's sacrifice. Those who see Anti-Christianity in this are right. V was fighting it.

I was fifteen years old, I was a social outcast, and I enjoyed the idea of an ostracized, wounded man raising up against the oppression of the system. As an adult, I see suspenseful drama that takes itself too seriously, whose political propensities are so obvious that only a self-absorbed melodramatic teenager could miss them. The only vendetta this film has is against political conservatism; it replaces President Bush with a fictitious corrupt British fascist regime and uses emphatic arguments to make the point that conservatives have been making for a very long time: too much government is a bad thing. Some of V's points are valid, but they are lost amongst the left wing, redefine marriage message and the explosions.

In the late 2020s, the United Kingdom is the only last stable government in the world and is led by the oppressive Norsefire party. Under such a tight regime, the people are controlled at every turn. The exchange? Bow down and youll live in peace and safety.

From out of the shadows rises V (Hugo Weaving), a Guy Fawkes-mask-wearing caped activist who has a thorough plan meant to topple the present government and, over the course of a year, expose the Norsefire regime for what they really are and inspire the people to be free.

After being saved by V from an attempted rape, Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) goes into hiding in Vs lair and learns not only of Vs plans for the UK, but also about herself, her fears, and what it will take for her to rise from her own ashes to help him on his quest.

This movie was based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.

Hugo Weaving is insane in this. His acting is through the roof! I mean, come on, the guy had a mask on the entire time. You don't see his face, and yet with every nuance of every word, every expressive tone, every bit of body language, you didn't need the aid of a face to sell you on what he was saying or why he was saying it. No small feat and was truly amazing. And that V speech when he introduces himself to Evey? Go. Watch it. Now. Awesome.

Natalie Portman is the bomb as Evey Hammond. I love her in nearly everything she does and her performance in V for Vendetta is no exception, especially when her character starts going through the wringer and she starts to break down. That scene where she gets her head shaved? That happened in real life. That was really her hair and was a one-take deal shot with three cameras, and a very poignant scene in the film. Her journey from start to finish is the audiences on-screen link to V and his quest, and by the end, you're with him one hundred percent.

While there are some differences between the movie and the graphic novel, they by no means take away from it, in my opinion. There will always be differences when adapting books to film.

V in this flick is a kind of Robin Hood-meets-Zorro figure, but instead of having the people behind him, hes on his own with only Evey at his side. However, over the course of the year the story takes place, and as V unfolds his plan, the people start to get behind him, first in their hearts and then in their actions.

Speaking of action, I love Vs fighting in this, spinning his swords and holding his own against multiple opponents. Some of the trickery he uses to evade capture also reminds me of Batman-like tactics.

The movie is a strong one, interesting from start to finish, and one that not only inspires, but makes me grateful I live in a free country like Canada and not in a fascist state.

V for Vendetta also spilled over into the real worldour worldinspiring folks to wear Guy Fawkes masks during public demonstrations, like Occupy Wall Street. If that doesnt show the impact of a movie, I don't know what does.

This is a superhero movie with depth and is an important addition to any superhero fans library.

The story itself applies even more in our current times than when it was first printed in the '80s, and when Weaving does V's intro where every word starts with a V was nothing short of masterful.

Is it as good as the original books?  That's a matter of taste IMO, I have the original first prints and loved the story then.  I now have the movie and while it's an adaption, I still enjoyed it a great deal.  Either way its a thought provoking story, and while there's action to keep things tense the real treasure is the drama and it's message.

As far as the Bluray itself is concerned I had no problems with its quality or content.  However I did have a small beef with them saying it included the graphic novel.  Owning the prints myself, I can tell you that you're getting a incomplete copy of it.

7762385,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I read the novel first, which usually is a recipe for disaster, but this adaptation was well done.  Admittedly, there is a lot of subtlety missing in the film that I think adds to the overall story, but the film remarkably manages to catch the key points and not to actually misrepresent anything of substance...  I found several of the scenes very poignant even knowing ahead of time that they were coming, and that is quite rare...  I am a fan of Natalie Portman to begin with, and she does an excellent job of capturing our hearts...
I do not often recommend a film over a novel, and I still think the book is better, but I think this story is strong enough to be worth watching even if you never get around to reading the full story...
A powerful story that has had as much impact on our generation as 1984 in its time, I think it a story every person of our time period should familiarize ourselves with.",1424217600,,909,4.3352941176470585

7762401,2,B01GJQM5JM,"I really liked the graphic novel. So watching this movie, I enjoyed it but it just seemed... off. It seemed to miss the mark of what the graphic novel meant. (Or what I thought it meant, anyway.)

Before I proceed, I'll get it out here that I'm a liberal. I'm a left-wing skeptic, anti-religion, etc. Your world view influences what you take away from a movie like this, so there's mine.

Anyway, there were many changes added to the story, in an apparent attempt to make it ""relevant for today"". This had the effect of dumbing down the story, and turning it into a story about America. It should have been an English story about the dangers of corrupt government and the role of personal responsibility in maintaining freedom. Instead, we get a 9/11 whack job fantasy.

What do I mean? Here is some stuff that never happened in the book, but was added as an ""improvement"" over the source material:

1. Thousands of people die in a horrible tragedy, but it turns out to be an Inside Job done by the government, to gain power.

2. Big Pharma makes people sick on purpose, and the people who own it all grow rich on the backs of the common man.

3. A Koran is kept secretly by a gay guy, to appreciate the beauty of it, and hide it from the evil Republican government.

Nonsense! Stuff like this insults the intelligence of both conservatives and liberals. For one thing, the ""inside job"" thing was obviously added as a direct parallel to 9/11. That misses the mark for most intelligent people, as only the most ludicrous among us believe that conspiracy theory nonsense.

Likewise, the jab at Big Pharma was really stupid. The novel was not about left wing wacko conspiracy theories (yes, we liberals have our wackos - same as you right-wingers do). It was about fascism and what can be done about a totalitarian government.

There are important questions in the novel - questions that never get asked in the movie: What exactly is terrorism? Is it ever justified? Is anarchy desirable? Or sometimes necessary? And out of the ashes of the old and corrupt, can a good government arise?

But this movie never goes there. Instead it injects unneeded distractions like a love story subplot and a nice happy ending.

That was something else that bothered me too - the ending. I won't spoil it but what bothers me is the whole development of both Finch and Evey. Finch in the book isn't quite the squeaky clean good cop, and doesn't make exactly a 180 degree turnaround.

And Evey in the book becomes a leader, not just some girl watching fireworks. In the book, her future role is clear: to carry on V's legacy through rebuilding. In the movie, it's not clear what her role is.

There were things that the movie got right, such as showing the totalitarian state as corrupt. It didn't adequately portray a state religion in league with it, however, and I think this was a mistake. The book does not condemn religion, or even touch on it. It just shows a state-run institutionalized religion, which no conservative I know would ever support. The movie is not clear on this, which comes off as just condemning all religion except Islam. Crazy!

Likewise unexplained - though maybe they didn't need to - is V's superhuman reflexes and mental abilities. In the book, it is clear that he got those from the experiments done on him. In the movie, it just comes off as an excuse to look ""Matrix-ey"" with some slo mo.

The government in both the book and movie is anti-gay though. At least they got that right. For those complaining about this movie promoting ""the gay agenda"", realize that the intent is to show a totalitarian regime something akin to Nazism. In that world, homosexuals aren't welcome and neither are minorities. The book was clearer on that last point, describing a purge where all the minorities were rounded up. It wasn't just about homosexuality, and if that was your takeaway from this story, then I chalk that up to a terrible screenplay. One that again, misses the main point of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's novel.

The graphic novel is really great. But the movie? Although it looks great, and I like all the actors, I think it is a misfire. Great cinematography, wrong message. Not recommended, unfortunately.

If I hadn't read the excellent book first, I may have felt differently.",1422316800,4,4294,4.643799472295514

But the movie is too violent and unrealistic.  The hero tells his supporters to gather at the Parliament building, and then he blows up the building while his supporters are surrounding the building, yet no one gets hurt.  The pro-violence message of the movie really detracts from its appeal (unless you're the type that loves the Hollywood action movies that glorify violence and portray it in completely unrealistic ways). If you care about realism and truth, this movie at least fairly realistically portrays a police state, but it is very unrealistic and dishonest in the way it portrays violence.  You will not find truth in Hollywood.",1420848000,2,773,5.047244094488189

7762428,4,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie is powerful like only a movie of this nature can be.  At times, it feels like it is depicting current state of affairs in America.

The movie is well done and feels like there is a deepness to it.  It's an interesting movie even without the backdrop of current political realities.  It has a bit of a superhero flavor to it so there is a lot of action throughout the movie so it keeps you pretty gripped into it.  It's a movie that is worth your time if you like seeing parallels between art and life. (Weird for me to hear the exact same excuse on the part of those in charge of the torture in this movie - it was written in 2005  and the current  excuse for torture comments today regarding the torture report release in 2014.)

 The main character V was a political activist once tortured and escaped now sets his eyes on revenge not only from his torturers but of those in charge that created the torturers.  He happens to help EV (Natalie Portman) who grows to respect and love V.  I thought they all did a great job of acting.  Natalie Portman was spot on though I do have a criticism for her character in at least one moment in the movie. (POSSIBLE SPOILER- DON'T READ ANY MORE If you are planning on watching)  I don't know if anyone would forgive someone who tortured them at least not so quickly as EV seems to do with V.

The Police State. The Nanny State. Fear and the culture of it. Perception vs. Reality. and a zillion memorable scenes and quotes.
""The multiplying villanies of nature do sarm upon them. Disdaining Fortune with his brandished steel, which 'smoked with bloody execution.""
I've always had an affinity for red roses and I have them tattoed on me due to my equivalent fanship of The Dark Tower III. My dearly beloved died in an awful way as well, so you can imagine the reaction I STILL HAVE when Evey discovers that the woman from room IV, was real - and what it means to V; the reason for his Vendetta.

7762471,5,B01GJQM5JM,"It had been a while since I'd seen this movie, so the time was right to revisit it. While it has lost a little of its power in the years since, there's no denying that it is still one of the most entertaining and provocative movies of the 21st century. Recounting the plot is almost pointless now, as most everyone who's into movies knows it at this point. What I can say is that all of the performances are excellent, in particular Hugo Weaving as V. Despite having a mask over his face, or being obscured through darkness, he manages to give a performance with a lot of depth and nuance. He might represent an idea or symbol, but he brings humanity to his character and more than a little bit of wit (and wordplay). I still think that Natalie Portman is the weak link in the cast, but she isn't terrible, by any means. As far as the technical aspects go, most of the special effects still hold up rather well and the film, as a whole, is beautifully shot. There's also some variation on the bullet-time effect that the Wachowskis popularized with their Matrix trilogy (and who wrote this screenplay). James McTeigue, the director and long-time Wachowski collaborator, did his finest directing work with this film in my opinion. Overall, with an engaging, well-acted story that has still has relevant political themes, you can't get much better than this. And may this film never be forgot.",1417824000,10,1391,4.612903225806452

Guard: ""Then you have no fear anymore. You are free.""
The above dialog caused me to think about the fact that when you reach the point of no fear, you reach the point of possibilities.

It caused me to think about more than that. I love this movie for the questions it provokes, the thoughts it stimulates and the issues it confronts.
You could spend an evening debating any number of thoughts brought up in this film. But, do personalize it. Where do you fit in your thoughts in relationship to the film?  Is it ever right to do a wrong to correct an evil?
This movie was recommended to me by my son. ""You gotta watch this movie!"" And I did. Over and over again.

Now,  if you don't want to think or discuss  the movie afterwards because it feels like English literature class dissection all over again, just pop some popcorn and watch it for the enjoyment  a good movie brings. You don't have to 'get' anything out of it except the escape, but I dare you not to question something!
 Just beware that some of the action scenes, especially near the end of the movie  are a bit bloody, if you are sensitive to that sort of thing. I close my eyes at one point as after I saw it the first time I decided I don't need that image over and over again.

7762581,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Many of the critics and fans of the V for Vendetta graphic novel have a strong dislike for the Hollywood depiction of the story. It is mostly centered around the fact that the movie ditched the pure anarchist theme of the graphic novel. In the graphic novel, V is making actions purely for the sake of anarchy. The movie takes on a theme of overcoming totalitarian government and focuses more on giving freedom to everyone rather than anarchy to everyone.

Regardless of which you prefer, this is an extremely well done movie and it is worth buying. I have watched this movie countess times, with many people, as it is often a movie that I like to show others. And considering that many people have not seen it, it is worth owning.

One minor note, my blu ray that I received has no start menu, it goes straight to the movie. There is a small pop-up menu that comes up if you press menu on the remote. Not a huge deal but it just seemed kind of odd. Not sure if all the copies of the movie are like this.

7762588,5,B01GJQM5JM,This is a very well done film.  Hugo Weaving's performance as V is elegant and subtle.  I have not read the graphic novel on which the film was based but intend to soon.  I love films that make me think and inspire me to learn more about historical events.  I would have never known about Guy Fawkes and learned about that particular slice of British history that appears to continue to inspire many modern day activists and anarchists if not for this film.  It is unfortunate that V for Vendetta did not have the broad reach of The Matrix because I think there is a lot of thought provoking material in it and it is very well acted and orchestrated.,1408924800,,650,4.383333333333334

7762620,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie reminds us what can happen when a terrified nation trades away its personal liberties and freedoms for the illusion of security. History has shown, time and again, that the greatest crimes against humanity have been perpetrated by governments, not by individuals. In V for Vendetta, the central government is headed by a charasmatic and despotic leader, John Hurt. At first glance the criminals and victims appear to be different entities. But, upon further reflection, we see they are essentially one in the same; an obedient and largely apathetic populace. They dutifully comply as all political dissent is crushed and the ""terrorists"" are rounded up and sent to concentration camps. As ""V"" remarks to Evey Hammond, ""Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror."" V for Vendetta is a thought provoking look at a near-future dystopian society that has been imprisoned within a cell of its own making. Highly recommended!",1405468800,,1091,5.100558659217877

7762630,4,B01GJQM5JM,"The film is thought provoking and intelligent.  I had very high expectations going into this film as it has been on my to-watch list for many years and never got around to it.  Many people told me about how great this film is. This film came in slightly under my expectations but that not due to any fault of its own but of the consistent hype it was given to me over the years.  I plan to watch this film a few more times as the dialogue is lengthy, sometimes convoluted, but somehow still engaging and grips you.  There was a few times during the film that I had to pause and rewind to understand what was said in the dialogue.  It should be made aware to the general audience that this is by no means an action film.  It is heavier on dialogue which I respected and the action when it took place was well shot.  I would recommend this film to an audience that is interested in more than a summer spectacle and willing to put their brainpower to use.",1404432000,,952,4.197802197802198
7762631,4,B01GJQM5JM,"The movie definitely felt forced at times. It was good overall, but it tried to draw a parallel between Guy Fawkes and liberation of a people, when the Gunpowder Plot was really more of a religious thing. Also, a lot of the movie was stupidly cheesy, like the emphasized super-human ninja skills' sound effects. I guess it was good for what it was, but if I wanted to watch a movie about torture in order to 'free' a person, I'd watch Saw. Though I suppose I have a soft spot for vigilantes.

One thing the movie did fantastically was create a dreamy/sexy character without actually ever showing him. V in everyday circumstance has a really cute and playful personality, but powerful and commanding presence when he goes public with his vendetta (seriously, no pun intended).",1404432000,4,775,4.7407407407407405

7762633,4,B01GJQM5JM,"You know I have always found this movie a little confusing. This is the second, perhaps third, time seeing it and I must say that it was brilliantly done. The movie certainly makes people think about where they live and even how they live. The movie makes us look at our lives and the government that looms over us at all times. I am not a revolutionist, but this video made me feel like one because I agreed with it.",1404345600,,417,4.225

He spends he elects he ignors the the wishes of the country to push his agenda down our throught's.

Now here I am buying my third copy! It's one of the favorites that gets loaned out without an expectation of being returned, I love sharing it.
Evey (Natalie Portman) has a low level job at the state-run broadcast/media station. Being outside after curfew in an Orwellian England proves to be dangerous indeed, but a mysterious masked man known as The Terrorist (Hugo Weaving) comes her rescue. Within days, she is given the chance to return the favor, and protects him.
Over the next year, they continue to save each other, in every way that a person can be saved...physically, spiritually, and emotionally.
But it is also England and her people that need rescuing from a corrupt dictatorship, can two lone people possibly make a difference?

Wonderful uses of color and lighting authentically nail the feel of each scene. Get your own copy.",1401580800,,929,4.734567901234568

Thats the best he's got? He couldn't come up with something freaky deaky to do with Natalie P? No wonder he wears a mask and doesn't get along well with people.

7762710,1,B01GJQM5JM,"I did not read the graphic novel by Alan Moore that this movie was based on, but did hear that it was the story of a wounded anarchist whose goal was to bring down a crumbling dictatorship that was ruling Britain.  It was written in the 1980's and the movie likely had extremely little to do with the graphic novel it was based upon.

The Britain of the movie is under the control of a Christian theocracy...never mind that modern-day Britain is hardly a strongly religious nation.  Far from a crumbling society, things for the most part look nice and new and shiny.  Furthermore, the hero V, for having been badly burned in a fire, is able to speak clearly and very agile and quick for someone who had suffered such physical damage.  Besides that, even though everyone and everything is supposed to be closely watched, V is able to gather up and maintain a huge secret room full of antiques, and also is able to send dozens of Guy Fawkes masks through the postal system.

Other ridiculous parts also creep into the movie.  The society is strongly anti-homosexual (the product of evil Christianity presumably), and one homosexual man admires the beauty of the verses of the Koran.  Duh, that's like a Jew enjoying ""Mein Kampf"".

Worst is the ending.  The people get their Guy Fawkes masks and put them on and walk into the streets, walk up to armed guards...and suddenly walk right through them unmolested.  Then a train full of explosives blows up the buildings of Parliament and Big Ben...and that's it.  What happens next?  Anarchy?  Democracy?  Everything just ends right there.",1393632000,9,1582,4.7226277372262775

A progressive socialist by nature, in The Watchmen his villain turned out to be the left wing progressive, his heroic, self-sacrificing anti-heroes the right-wing zealots Moore claims to deplore. Sadly V for Vendetta was an earlier Moore comic book, written well before Edward Snowden revealed to the world that Obama's surveillance of the American people is worse than Bush on steriods (and W never used intel to demolish domestic political opponents and surppress the opposition vote as Obama and the IRS did), so all the bad guys resemble Rush Limbaugh,and the evil government is a bunch of Christian zealots. Yawn.

The hollowness of this argument is proven by the fact that the mask from V became an icon of the Occupy Wall Street Movement, but there was so little reailty to their vague political opinions and demands that, unlike the Tea Party, OWS completely died away.",1390003200,3,927,4.980645161290322

First of all, it has a really good story to it, but also a moral story about standing up and believing in a cause to fight against oppression and tyranny and how their strength in numbers. Guy Fawkes was a real person and there really was a gunpowder plot. Unfortunately, he was caught and put the death, but if you look at history and what Benjamin Franklin done, he was printing papers in a fictitious name and sending them out to the colonies to spread the truth about what was really going on and what was going to take place even when they are writing the Constitution that was considered treason and if that would be as of today it would be considered terrorism.

The story is so smart and really make's you think it gave my brain a workout, the first time I saw the movie in theaters just like the first time I saw the first Matrix. Hugo Weaving plays V to perfection, he is a hell of an actor and the fact that you never see his face adds to the intense nature of his acting. the fact that he has to do all his acting behind a mask and use body movements to really bring the character to life is a treat. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she gives a very strong performance and I love that she got her head shaved for the role even if they paid her to shave her head that's dedication to your art, cause women love their hair lol. john hurt is amazing as well he plays a cold sadistic dictator bastard to scary realism. there is not much action in the film but the action it does have is stylized and done very well with some cool knife and gun fights. this was my first review",1386028800,,1170,4.227678571428571

In a future society a caricature of a totalitarian state, a young lady's eyes are opened to its reality; but the story is actually about the interaction between the protagonist ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) and the lady, Evey (Natalie Portman.)

It is not just straight forwarded anti-government it deals with a cabal.

As we travel their path we too may have our eyes opened.

7762790,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I really enjoyed this well crafted film. 'V' is thought provoking and impressive as it delivers on multiple levels.

Set in near future London, 'V' creates a compelling story as it extrapolates current events within the dark, brooding themes borrowed from the original ""Phantom of the Opera"". However, 'V' is far from a reprise of the original 'Phantom': although remaining true to 'Phantom's' original tragic love story, 'V' re-purposes the personal to convey its broader, social/political statement.

If you're not put off by fairly graphic violence, I believe you'll enjoy 'V' as every facet of this film was well thought out and crafted to strengthen its theme. No clinkers here in the acting department. Natalie Portman, faced with a demanding role, renders a compelling 'Evey' and Hugo Weaving's mysterious 'V' was truly mesmerizing. Excellent support provided by Stephan Rea, John Hurt, and Stephan Fry: they also deserve considerable credit for delivering intriguing, believable characters.

A brainwahsed population basically nodding their heads in agreement to whatever their government or the news media puts out as the truth. One man cuts through the bulls*** to empower and educate the citizens to fight back and take control of their destinies. The operative catch line in the movie, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people"" has probably been adopted as a rally cry amongst Tea Party zealots in this country, although they'll never really grasp it's context. And maybe that's what writer Alan Moore wanted. Hugo Weaving plays the title character V with Natalie Portman as his reluctant accomplice in mayhem.

7762806,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Pros: Action packed, Thought provoking
Cons: Tackles mature themes (torture)

It is a great time of year to watch this movie. The opening scene flashes back to November 5, 1604 to introduce Guy Fawkes and his plot to blow up Parliament. This event lays the foundation for the rest of the film. The Wachowski brothers take us to futuristic Great Britian under a totalitarian government. They masterfully weave a tale of rebellion focusing on two protagonists- V (Hugo Weaving), and Evey (Natalie Portman). This film does a really good job of developing the characters and moving the plot forward at the same time. The dialogue is incredible - V has some of the wittiest and thought provoking lines/speeches I have heard in any movie. This film is great for people who enjoy movies that make you think. The themes it focuses on include - freedom fighter v. terrorist, rebellion, and fear and freedom.

With that being said this movie is not for everyone. It is violent and there are some scenes in a prison/torture that make some people uncomfortable. My wife doesn't really enjoy watching it. This movie is fairly intense so be sure you are up for that before you start it.

I enjoy this movie so much and I try to watch it every year around November the 5th. I always come away impressed with the quality of the story, the acting, and the effects. While watching this movie you will realize that V stands for an idea and the idea will be very clear by the final scene.

7762818,1,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie was bad on too many levels. I'll try to briefly highlight them below:

1. Sound Quality. It was not an error of the movie itself, but rather, you can hardly hear the ""V"" character talking at many points in the movie. He talks so quickly and at such a low tone, you can barely hear what's going on. His personality is corny.

2. Story line. The story line was confusing and even contradictory at times. For example, one man is gay, yet he cherishes a copy of the Koran in his secret chamber. Do people not realize the Koran condemns homosexuality? Why would a homosexual ever value the Koran? It makes no sense.

Plus, this movie gets overly dramatic at points when it is not necessary, and the plot drags and gets off track too many times. It tries to be dramatic and make you relate with the character's problems, but totally falls short at doing this.

3. Forces the gay agenda down your throat. I didn't see anything in the reviews that this movie would be basically pushing the gay agenda down my throat, but of course it did that too. Why? I have no idea, as it seemed like someone just threw that part in the movie at the last minute to get your sympathy and the support of the gay crowd. It failed at both counts.

4. Not family friendly. I wouldn't dare watch a movie like this with children. It is definitely not a ""superhero"" type movie, like the trailer painted it. This is NOT like Batman or Spiderman. Families beware.

5. Encourages government rebellion. I'm no fan of the government, and personally think our current government is wicked. However, this movie should not really be encouraging violence and anarchy against the government. It does just that unfortunately.

Overall this was a huge waste of time and money. It was the worst few dollars I've ever spent in my life, and I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back.",1381795200,10,1856,4.457227138643068

But I believe that this is a far cry from what America's government is and I cant help but think that those who have reviewed this film are paranoid about big government. In the U.S government is no where near as being evil and controlling. Now a days the threat is different there are nukes and biological weapons therefore we must give up a certain amount of ""personal freedom"" for our safety but we do that with haste and with restraints, the way our government system works a dictatorship wouldnt be able to take place.

7762848,5,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is a candidate for the overused imaginary award category of ""the greatest movie ever made"" simply because it is the greatest movie of its prescient time.  It was made at a time when most other media channels had been successfully censored and controlled by Corporate Big Brother (as they still are to a large degree), while a united cabal of Corporate and billionaire power dragged the United States to the precipice of fascism.  Movies were one of the few ways to get a democratic message across.  The success of the Wachowski brothers gave them a freedom of expression that few others in the media had, a freedom protected by their uncanny ability to make scads of money when left to their own creative devices.  The fear of killing the goose that laid the Golden Egg trumped the fear of freedom of expression.

""V"" builds on the concept created in ""The Matrix"", by far the greatest movie of the Matrix Trilogy: the notion of a totalitarian regime that exerts its control over the masses in part by carefully crafted and controlled reality creation, and then goes much further.  Unlike the Matrix, V clearly establishes connections to real life events and persons, both actual and projected, such as when it portrays the United States as having descended into anarchy as blowback for its initiation of illegal wars of aggression (deemed illegal by the ""quaint"" Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg trials), complete with demonstrations with protest signs expressly identifying then-president Bush.  Right wing corporate propagandists are accurately symbolized by a composite character (Dominic) that is an irritating amalgam of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and similar right wing corporate mouthpieces from England.  Second-in-Command ""Creepy"" Creedy is an inspired interpretation/extrapolation of America's then Second (?)-in-Command vice president Dick Cheney.  John Hurt comes full-circle from victim of totalitarianism in the movie ""1984"" to totalitarian victimizer in ""V"" as the inspired choice as a prophetic tie-in to George Orwell's ""1984"", complete with numerous spot-on allusionary warnings left to be identified by the viewer.  Hurt's character unites, leads, coerces, and bullies the futuristic right wing regime into a cohesive controlling unit of Fascist England with England being symbolic of the West in general, while simultaneously dealing with the opposition as brutally as possible to thwart the will to resist.

Although one could surmise from the movie's title that the hero, ""V"", utilizes his more-likely-than-comic-book-usual superpowers to become yet another avenger of the many wrongs perpetrated by Evil, a usually accurate conclusion that can nevertheless be quite entertaining, but quite wrong in this case.  For while V has some very impressive abilities attributed to nerve damage caused by his being the subject of biotoxic experimentation, he is merely the (barely) human vessel containing the means by which those held captive by fascism are freed.  V is the repository and transmitter of ideas, and it is ultimately those ideas which are the Hero of the movie, a very unusual cinematic proposition indeed.  And isn't that often a key component of great movies: unusual cinematic propositions?

PS  For more enlightenment as to how this whole scenario will play out, read the Pulitzer Prize Winning ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer, from which a startling number of similarities to modern events can readily been seen, and watch the great movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to see what generally lay in store for the surviving perpetrators.",1377648000,,3622,5.3169877408056045

Disfigured by his arrest and mistreatment of this government, he escaped to seek revenge on those responsible. He enlists the aid of Evey, played by Natalie Portman. Without to much explanation about the plot, the movie is about people having the courage to stand up to tyranny, and this is why I like it. I also like the 'V' character wearing the Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film. This mask has been adapted by protesters around the world who demonstrate against repressive governments, and also used by the 'Anonymous' group to hide their true identities. I would compare it to the '1984' novel and movies, except this time the good guys win.",1377302400,,818,4.892086330935252

7762865,1,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship. It tries to demonstrate this with four plots. The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.

The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.

The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.

It's a great idea.

But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:

Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is:
Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby:
V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courts
From there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules. This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V.

Great idea, just didn't work for me.

SPOILER ALERT

A well-made film will pull its audience in for its entire length. However, unrealities in this flim's plot jolt the viewer back to reality twice.

A young woman is captured, her head is shaved, and is held captive while being repeatedly tortured. All of these acts are accomplished by the same man yet film goers are expected to believe that this woman never once realizes that it is the same man.

And the filmmaker's abrupt intrusion with a sexual political agenda where people living the gay lifestyle are portrayed always as hapless victims is jarring. The flimmaker's unethical sexual views should have been left on the cutting room floor.",1371686400,,973,4.843373493975903

7762915,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta remains true to its source material while avoiding the pitfalls of a slavishly faithful adaptation. I'll be honest -  the movie would be dull and plodding if it included everything in the second book of the graphic novel. Slow and dreary sideplots do little to add to a film's experience and invariably end up causing viewers to glance at their timepieces.

Fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic. Hugo Weaving is exemplary as the psychotic yet compassionate terrorist V, and Stephen Fry adds black humour to a depressing film about power-hungry corporatists. The hypocrisy of fascist dictatorships is put on display in all its ugliness. High Chancellor Sutler is not content to refrain from enjoying music he does not approve of. He must also outlaw anything that has offended him or is used as a threat to his rule.

The plot is very similar to the movie, with Evey staying at Deitrich's house instead of that of a generous stranger. V's Shadow Gallery is recreated in extreme detail and faithfulness. Delia's atrocities are reproduced to a starkly realistic effect, and are alone worth the price of admission.

The tale behind the regime's rise to power (not detailed in the comics) is given the royal treatment, providing further enjoyment and deeper enjoyment for fans of the comic. The film's strongest point lies in Evey's incarceration, and although the ending doesn't quite follow the books, it is still powerful and inspiring.",1370304000,2,1524,4.988188976377953

The only real complaint I have (and it is a minor one) is that the ending is highly improbable in our modern society.

Everyone knows how great the movie is, what i am going too talk about is the audio and video presentation which is amazing!!  Video is crisp and sharp with no dnr too be found, which can sometimes be hard to obtain in a dark film, and this is a very dark film as a whole. Audio is presented in Dolby TRUE hd 5.1, which is very detailed in every area, this film is very dialogue heavy and every word is heard very clearly, when it needs too get loud it does and goes very low in the LFE department. Their is some very demo worthy material in here, just turn it up and select the chapter where big ben blows up and you will impress all your friends.

I bought the just released steelbook version and the front and rear artwork is stunning, but their is no inner artwork with this disc, it is also just the one disc, it does not come with a separate special features disc(i don't think the original did either)or a digital copy/ultraviolet disc or slip so i was kind of disappointed by that but as a whole it will look great on your shelf.",1368316800,,1219,4.855769230769231

7762938,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source-material and becomes a truly influential piece of work.  Set in a Fascist Great Britain following the victory of Germany in World War II, it shows the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving) taking revenge on all those government servants and employees who consciously used human beings for experiments, while deliberately creating an epidemic so as to encourage the people to support them.  Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure.  V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process.  With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire - in a deliberate reenactment of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 - V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so-called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power.

  The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase ""good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails"". Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying ""That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much."" The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a ""yellow coded"" curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.

  When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should.

The film questions what it is to be human - freedom to love, freedom to speak etc - and leaves you wondering what it is you value the most in this sense, what could you give up and what would you fight for. The fact that we never find out the identity of V is so important. The fact that at the end, all the characters that were supposedly gone, all showed up meant that we questioned what was real and what was all V's creation.

7763013,2,B01GJQM5JM,"I liked the graphic novel. For all its philosophical and historical cluelessness, you could see Moore was an artist who was really trying, although supremely confused. But I just re-watched this, thinking I had enjoyed it somewhat the first time, and it was much less impressive than I remembered.

It is so sad to see people praising this movie as ""thoughtful"" or ""smart."" It is a commentary on how badly our educational system has failed them. For those who are cognizant of actual current events and actual history know how muddled and confused this film is. The structure of the film itself is some action punctuating tedious sermons about the dangers of fascism and intolerance. It ""bravely"" casts Christianity as a danger and all others (including Islam) as victims.

So this movie is a kind of ""opposite day"" in spades.

To expound, anyone paying attention would see that, today, the only religion under constant persecution in mass media and actual, physical threat of death is, in fact, Christianity, from Hollywood to Burma, Africa, and various Communist states. They are routinely slaughtered by the villagefull with nary a peep from the press or the UN. The gay lifestyle is celebrated in the West. Apart from the odd exception, it is in fact Islamists who are burning the Bible and killing infidels. The media is not controlled by Rush Limbaugh, but his opposite numbers, and in staggering array. It is the Bible that gave rise, through long, painful birth pangs, to modern freedom, despite the failings and crimes of its followers, whereas anti-Church Darwinism, which Moore espouses, gave us the horrors of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Che, et al. and their collective massacres, tortures, imprisonments and injustices in the name of progress. (Yep, surprise: the Hitler-Darwin connection is historically unassailable.)

Opposite Day, indeed.

In this alternate reality, all this is unknown. Indeed, to enjoy this movie, you have to purge your head of these realities. But that aside, and supposing an alternate history to justify this narrative, this film should be tedious even to the most ardent believer of these fictions. It hits you over the head in ham-handed heaviness, over and over again, with these eternal untruths. Long stretches of yakkety-yak to ensure that you are well inculcated with Opposite History are sprinkled liberally. Plot holes abound. Bad guys have protection details outsourced to the Keystone Cops.

However, there is redemption. In their earnestness, the writers forgot to excise the pro-2nd Amendment message - governments should fear their peoples. The people should be armed to resist tyranny.

Think on this, even if you loved this movie. What if, per this movie, armed, government-backed Limbaughites were knocking on your door in the middle of the night? You would want to be armed. Yes, the 2nd is meant to foil any sort of tyranny, whether from the Right or Left.

The rest of this movie is self-righteous sermonizing and violent revenge fantasy. Bags of salt are advised. To those who still think this movie was ""smart"", I would suggest challenging your mind with something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-So-Great-about-Christianity/dp/1414326017/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's So Great about Christianity</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Delusion-Atheism-and-its-Scientific-Pretensions/dp/0465019374/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions</a>.

7763049,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Lots of action and an intense plot.  I liked it a lot and my 16-year-old son LOVES it.  It lead us into a whole discussion of Guy Fawkes and why it's relevant today.  We spent some time researching it.  When a movie leaves you (and your teenager) with that kind of curiosity, it's a good movie.  I was worried it would be too maudlin super-hero, but it wasn't.  It was anti-hero/heroine.  It has stayed with me and informed me in ways few other movies have.  I have watched it several times since our initial viewing and my son recommends it to everyone.  And Natalie Portman is fantastic!",1355356800,,589,4.429906542056075
7763050,5,B01GJQM5JM,"One of my all time favorite movies. Everything was great in this movie from the script, to the acting and especially the action. Some may say its a little heavy handed with the message of the movie. But I think that's the only way I could have been done. I got it on blue ray because the visuals are stunning and worth watching in HD.",1355270400,,334,4.153846153846154

7763052,3,B01GJQM5JM,Don't think you could get that many people to agree on anything no matter how important. Too camy for me. Maybe geared for younger audiences.,1355011200,,141,4.68
7763053,5,B01GJQM5JM,Awesome movie! Don't start the Revolution without.  Notice how your own Government RIGHT NOW isn't too far off from this one in the movie.,1355011200,,138,4.75

7763058,4,B01GJQM5JM,The story in this movie is very interesting and thought provoking.  It kind of parallels the way our societies have been moving lately with powerful governments and correuption.  I enjoyed the movie but wish it would have been less violent.  A good story can be told without so much blood.,1354752000,,289,4.74

7763060,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I never get tired of watching this film, and not just because Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are wonderful. It's one part revenge movie, one part politely uprising, one part love story. The story keeps you engaged from start to finish, whether or not you sympathy size with the premise (a re-enactment of Guy Falks day, complete with dynamite and fireworks). Its symbolism was not lost on me, and one could find similarities with the Wall Street protests in 2012. It left me, curiously, with a sense of hope. A great movie!",1354406400,,525,4.717391304347826
7763061,5,B01GJQM5JM,one of my moat favorite movies. I love the story line and if you never watched it your missing an amazing movie.  I bet you can't watch it only once.,1354320000,,149,3.966666666666667
7763062,1,B01GJQM5JM,"I left. The main character making V's over and over crushed me. I know this is a weak review; I just had to put in my one star on this one. I only hate one other action movie this much, which was Face Off with Nicholas Cage. He kept saying ""Face Off"" to make sure you got it. V for Vendetta? Are you sure? I was thinking it was an S. V? Really?  Can you repeat that again?  It was painful.",1354233600,,389,3.7901234567901234
7763063,4,B01GJQM5JM,"First, I will not compare the movie to the book.  Both have their own pros and cons, good and bad points, and while are close have different themes and come at those themes from different directions.
V the movie is about a terrorist who demands that the people of England make sure a totalitarian government is held accountable for its actions.  He is a terrorist trying to get back at those who harmed him in the past.  And in doing so he may end up freeing the people from a Fascist government. But the movie delivers its message of liberation in a wonderful way that could only be called a form of art.  Hugo Weaving as V is such a good actor he can project his feelings and emotional reactions from BEHIND A MASK.  Natalie Portman, while not as powerful or as skilled as Weaving still holds up her part of the story as Evey.
John Hurt as the leader was, for me, a great pick.  He was W. Smith from 1984's Nineteen Eighty-Four so I find it ironic.  Stephen Rea as the police detective is a good balance of smarts and loyalty to the government to make his character just THIS side of reality.  Stephen Fry's character brings a little more reality to the movie yet also adds the one moment of disconnect for me.  The idea that he would get away with broadcasting something on the telly that was not approved by the state-run media does seem a tad unbelievable.
Add explosions to the great characters, a solid story, important themes, great fight scenes, and what you get is a Four out of Five film.
Overall I enjoyed the movie even while I am also a fan of the book - to me there is no conflict.  Fan of the book or not I suggest, strongly, that you give it a try.  Rent it or get it out of the library.  I bought my copy and will very likely watch it a couple of times before my DVD gives out.
Just remember, it is Rated R, so not for kiddies.  And at 132 minutes you will want lots of yummy popcorn. Enjoy!",1354233600,,1909,4.211538461538462
7763064,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I'm not sure why I like this movie so much. The story takes place in England, as now the most powerful county in the world. A masked hero/villain who has a history with the main characters attempts to overthrow this new communistic government. There were many famous actors in this movie. It has to be watched more than once to fully understand everything that is said, and so that you can connect everything together. If you don't, you will miss a few things that help make the movie what it is. Happy to have added this to my collection.",1354147200,3,539,4.454545454545454
7763065,3,B01GJQM5JM,"The movie was good. But the DVD full screen edition was 4:3 scale. Not the 16:9 scale that I was looking for.

7763066,5,B01GJQM5JM,I considered it a great example of how people can get together for a common cause. This was done using an action based thriller theme. The mask was what caught my attention first.,1353974400,,179,4.454545454545454
7763067,5,B01GJQM5JM,This is one of my favorite all time movies. It is necessary to sit through it without interruption. A great movie. I will purchase it for my collection.,1353974400,,152,4.464285714285714
7763068,3,B01GJQM5JM,This is your typical and fashionable Euro anti-Americanism whereby all the dark forces of European historical absolutism of the left and right is blamed on America and all things American. Anything new here?  Hugo Weaving is great with the alliterative lines.  Yet the simplistic plot thick with overblown acting-- otherwise known as dramatic posturing or 'chewing the scenery' style associated with British acting schools--overwhelms the 'story' if one may even call it that.  Of course we forgive movies with simplistic bombast if they are also entertaining.  V the movie is far more interested in its 2-dimensional statement of 'blame the yanks if life is going to hell in a handbasket' than in any semblance of entertaining its audience or provoking new thought.  I give it a moderate three stars for a jolly good display of Euro acting 101.,1353801600,,845,5.094202898550725

V, a man who was brutalized by the government, sets out to kill those in power who carried out the brutality, as well as to create a chaotic situation which might release the people from the hold of their terroristic government.  In fact, this mythic drama raises the question:  ""What really defines terrorism?""  It depicts aggression in the name of freedom.  I liked this film very much.",1353369600,,463,4.666666666666667

7763077,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Critics call this movie unpatriotic or Anti-Christian.

This is the story of a Totalitarian Society. One where the Government can Black List anything. Where every career is a pawn of the regime. Where the regime can enter homes without cause or warrant. Where citizens can be imprisoned or executed at the whim of it's dictator.

V was captured and experimented on by that regime. Those experiments erased his memory and enhanced his physical speed and reflexes. Those experiments also created Bio Weapons that let the regime enslave V's country. After escaping V spent the next few decades planning and executing his revenge - his revolution against that regime. V was fighting to free his country. Nothing could be more Patriotic.

That regime destroyed most religions. What it did to Christianity was even worse. It reduced the Church to a Political Puppet, a farce of the Church, a Mockery of all Christ was. It even turned the Cross into a Symbol of it's political power, instead of a sign of Christ's sacrifice. Those who see Anti-Christianity in this are right. V was fighting it.

V for Vendetta is a masterpiece for all to love.",1353283200,,1137,4.875647668393782

7763083,5,B01GJQM5JM,"First, I got this movie very quickly. It was faster than I expected, but I am glad I did, because I watched it the same night. haha

I think the quality of the blue ray lent to the story a more vivid and stark picture of the world of the movie. I just love the story, but it is a conflicting story where you love the hero although he is a terrorist, but you understand why he is doing what he is doing because of the wrongs done to him and you feel his pain and the pain of the people in this story....very thought provoking....

Hugo Weaving is amazing as ""V"", his voice was made for this movie and he poured himself into the character. Natalie Portman was good as ""Evie"", she gave a true believeability to the part and although at times i was like really? with her, her reactions were spot on....

Get this movie, it will make you think aobut what we think is right and wrong and is the price for vengence worth the cost.",1352246400,,923,4.116666666666666

7763088,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a terrific adaptation of the Comic series to a movie and a story line. One would think it was developed from a famous novel on the peer level of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or Lord of the Flies. This movie makes one think past the wonderful story to the mirror being held to the face of the USA today. We are only one election away from creating a government similar to one depicted in this film. Witty lines and a great but horrifying story keeps one entertained from start to finish. It leaves you with hope that humans will make the correct choice in times of need and not be sheep to fear of a make believe superstition and made up holy books.

The film is super-hero thriller that builds until its explosive ending. Despite the sometimes depressive story-line and bleak undertone, which is purposeful, the story has a great plot and ending full of redemption. It keeps you guessing, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. By the way, this purchase is a few years old, so since this purchase, I've invested in a Play Station 3.

7763105,2,B01GJQM5JM,"This really looked like my kind of movie: a bleak, repressive future with a strange anti-hero protagonist. Unfortunately, the future just didn't look all that bleak, and the protagonist was not very compelling.
While there is some gratitous violence carried out by government thugs, the people in this dsytopian future seem more bored than repressed. The future is dark, but it lacks the grittiness and character of such movies as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, or even Brazil.
The protagonist remains too much a mystery and there are too many unexplained and unlikely details about his life to make him a believable character. And it is really hard to identify with a character in a mask. Even the best actor can't express much emotion using only a muffled voice.
The female costar also has issues of believability and motive. Her actions seem driven soley by the plot. Similarly, the character of the hard-working cop is such a plot driven role, he actually seems bored with the whole affair.

Some may feel it is trite or superficial, that it's story about an evil regime is single-faceted, but that, in my opinion, is not what this movie is about. Obviously it is on the surface a work of dystopian fiction wherein the citizenry rises up in the name of freedom at the call of an anonymous messiah, but for me, it is a character-driven romance at heart. And though the romance is subtle enough to not define the genre of this film, the slow growth of love, and its effect on the titular messiah's motivations and actions, are why I love this story.",1343260800,,654,4.32520325203252

7763110,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a review for ""V For Vendetta - Two-Disc Special Edition"", to give some information on the extras included with the movie.

This is one of my family's favorite movies. It's exciting and it's stirring. Comic book but complex. Superbly filmed and acted, but then it had an amazing graphic novel to follow. Here's comments from participants in the DVD extras on this 2-disc Special Edition that echo my feelings about ""V for Vendetta"":

Kevin Phipps, supervising art director: ""You don't really know where you are, in terms of time. It's almost as if creativity has stopped."" (extra #1)

Daniel McTeigue, director: ""I think it's a political thriller, first and foremost. It is in the superhero genre, but it's also a play on that convention."" (Special Feature)

John Hurt, who plays Adam Sutler: ""The themes are serious. I'm not sure the treatment is as serious as that. But on the other hand, if it was as serious as that, I'm not sure that it would reach the amount of people that it's intended to reach."" (Special Feature)

Stephen Fry, who plays Dietrich: ""This is a movie about a terrorist. The hero is a terrorist. It's a very good ethical point, because as we all know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" (Special Feature)

Indeed, though I root for ""V"", he is not perfect. He wants the populace to stir themselves, stand up for themselves, and take their government back. But not until after he's had his vengeance.

DISC NUMBER ONE:
1.  The movie. Spoken languages available are the original English and dubbed French.  Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.
2.  Special Feature, 31 minutes: ""Freedom Forever! Making V for Vendetta"". This feature and extras 1, 2, and 3 were made at the same time. That is, when someone, such as the director, appears in more than one, you can tell that they were filmed at the same time. The extras compliment each other, rather than repeat each other. Interspersed with the interviews are film clips and production clips, too.
Participants include James McTeigue, director, who says, ""I was the assistant director on the Matrix films. To live in the Matrix world is to know the graphic novel world.""

DISC NUMBER TWO EXTRAS:
1.  ""Designing the Near Future"", 9 minutes. Interesting stuff. The V mask was cast in fiberglass from a clay mold. It took the sculptor several tries. Most of the film was made at the Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. But there were crucial outdoor scenes that had to be filmed in England, such as at the end, where the mass of V's converge on Trafalgar Square on the 5th of November. It took 5 months to set up the 3 nights of filming; about 30 agencies/organizations had to give approval and/or co-ordinate.
2.  ""Remember Remember: Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot"", 14 minutes. The history of the original gunpowder plot and how it's grown into an annual celebration in England. One interesting comment is by Sinead Cusack, who plays Delia Surridge. She was born in Dalkey, Ireland, and they have a different view of Guy Fawkes there.
3.  ""England Prevails: V for Vendetta and The New Wave in Comics"", 24 minutes. This is about the comic book, or graphic novel. The camera-shy Alan Moore does not appear, but David Lloyd, who created the graphics for Moore's narrative, appears in several of the extras.
Karen Berger, executive editor of Vertigo, DC's edgier more adult-oriented company says: ""V for Vendetta is in a class of its own. It's a brilliant piece of work. It's a commentary on society. At the time it was written, there was absolutely nothing being done like that.""
The original comic book was published in black & white in England. Twenty-six issues were created before the publisher folded. Unfortunately, this was before V's story was finished!  Both Alan Moore and David Lloyd were subsequently hired by DC comics, who saw the genius, and published a complete version of ""V"" in color.
4.  Cat Power Montage. This is like a song video. Clips of the movie are shown while Cat Powers sings ""I Found a Reason"", from The Covers Album (2000)
5.  Soundtrack album info
6.  Theatrical trailer

7763111,5,B01GJQM5JM,"It took me years to finally sit down and watch it (like most movies), but now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. I had seen a couple minutes of it when it had aired on tv, liked what I saw and looked it up on Amazon. I loved the fact that Amazon lets you stream it for 48 hours while waiting for the actual blu-ray to arrive. I streamed it twice thru my blu-ray player, and then still watched it again when I got my shipment. I would definitely suggest watching it a few times as there were different things I would notice each time I watched it. The cinematography was amazing, and the soundtrack was beautiful and I purchased it the following day. Great movie, even better message.",1341014400,,688,4.3
7763112,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Originally I decided to purchase the movie because I heard one of the lead character's names was Evey, my favorite name. I'm rating this purchase with 5 stars because this movie, although used was in impeccable condition, also the movie was great. This movie tells a story of a Dystopian government, and a mysterious man, known simply as ""V,"" who is trying to knock some sense into the citizens. He wants everyone to realize what they already know, but are too afraid to say aloud. V believes that the government should be afraid of its people, not the other way around. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes books like 1984 or the Hunger Games.",1340928000,,652,4.629310344827586

7763118,5,B01GJQM5JM,"When I first saw the title, I thought this movie was about someone avenging someone else. My guess was half right. This unknown man in mask who calls himself, ""V"" tried to blow up the Parliament building, as the original Guy Fawkes tried and failed the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Other than this movie taking place in England, the time period of this movie is the near future in 2035. Somehow this movie shows how this world may turn into: People live under censorship and surveillance, the mainstream media is blurred from truth, no one is allowed to criticize their own government, and the protective government became the so called, ""Big Brothers."" I pretty hope that things will not be like this and turn out in better ways. I believe that this movie, to go back to the topic, tried to enlighten the people. This ""V"" was trying to open the eyes of people to stop being ignorant and stand up against their corrupt government and watch as V blows up the Parliament building as a symbol of ending their current regime. The lessons of this movie are certainly not to stand up as masked vigilante to blow up the Parliament building. The real lesson would be for people to actually act as people of democracy and stand up for their rights and freedom from those who wants to take them away.",1338422400,,1285,4.543103448275862
7763119,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I had no previous knowledge of the movie or the book behind the movie so I approached the whole thing with no preconceived notions of what to expect. The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original; I felt myself being drawn in to the mystery and the danger and became very curious how things were going to progress. The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.

Hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey. The scenery and overall ambience of the movie are effective in conveying the oppressive nature of life under the dictatorial control of Chancellor Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt.

This is a dark, serious, action movie which I believe more sensitive children and adults should probably avoid. It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.",1338336000,,1053,4.8121546961325965

Please watch it with a open mind, so you'll be a part of the solution, instead of being a part of the brain washed masses of people, who has no clue of whats going on in their faces.

7763124,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I heard this title for years, but knew almost nothing about it. I'm glad I finally saw it.

I didn't catch exactly when this story takes place, but I recall the date 2035 being mentioned, so it was at least that far in the future. Much of the world is in chaos, but England is under the iron control of a theocracy. An unlikely hero emerges who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a black cape, and all black clothes.

He calls himself V (Hugo Weaving), and we know of him primarily through the eyes of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who becomes involved with him in an unusual way.

Everything about this story is unusual, although there are clearly elements reminiscent of other stories, both movies and books. The flavor of 1984 is in it, as well as The Count of Monte Christo, Phantom of the Opera, The Wall, and Zorro at least; you may well discover others. It was a graphic novel (i.e., comic book) before it became a movie.

I can tell you almost nothing about it without spoiling some of the best surprises. I saw elements of esoteric initiation traditions, radical theories of mind control, political science, mass communication, and more. If it helps to understand what I'm talking about, let me just say that you may want to play it often enough to grab some of the best quotes. Or perhaps I'll look for the graphic novel.

A movie that will live forever as a cult classic.",1336694400,,1391,4.460629921259843
7763125,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I have heard much hate towards this film from parties expecting it to offer either a more political view, or more action. In short, the political ideals presented here are nothing revolutionary, but mearly meant to make you ponder about how quickly human beings are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Admist this out-lying message, and montage of revolution, there are several well thought out fight scenes and sly assassinations carried out by V, leading up to the films ""revolutionary"" climax and Matrix-esque slow-motion ending that everyone has been talking about. In a nut-shell, it attempts to be both political and violent. However, if you go into the movie with an open mind, I doubt you will be disapointed. I cant help seeing simularites between the film and what our goverment is doing to day in the name of 'Keeping us SAFE'!",1336435200,2,843,4.943661971830986

7763140,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I make love to women.  It is amazing.  You could talk to me all day long and spend every minute trying to convince me it's not amazing.  You would be wasting your time.

I've been to church.  They seems to think otherwise.  They have this terrible fear that homosexuality is a mental disorder caused by venereal demons.  Not to knock a hardworking venerable demon, but I think that people who love to love people with the same organs, just love to love people with the same organs.  They couldn't ""gay"" me, and I couldn't straighten them with medieval rack and an empty bottle of wine.  (I use empty wine bottles as rolling pins; quit wasting money you perverts.)

This movie focuses on homosexuality and a handful of characters.  If you wanted someone to translate the book you have already read into a movie, then you'll be five kinds of disappointed.  I don't fault the film for this though.  Alan Moore is an ascended master of the English language.  He took hundreds of pages of English gloom to slowly build a story out of texture in the negative space of his fully developed fascist nightmare.  That's because it took hundreds of pages.  I don't believe a film could do his book justice, any better than the justice served by his fictional, fascist, secret police.

The movie takes a few characters and a few good notes from Alan Moore's book.  Those notes come out a little loud and over the top.  The story isn't quite up to par with the material that inspired it.

I don't want to analyze the whole movie.  I want to speak just on the gay parts.  There are a lot of comments on here about how people think that it's too preachy.  It is preachy; that's fair.  There are also comments about some kind of evil gay agenda.  As if homosexuals were prancing across the park in pink furry boas and playing Queen on flutes to lead the Children of America away to some candy-coated, but ultimately poisoned by AIDS funworld of gay sex.

No one ever tells a dentist how to put his tool in his patient's mouth.  The dentist is clearly the expert, and the patient clearly wants the tool in their mouth.  Why then do straight fuddy-duddies feel comfortable telling gay men and women what they can put in whose mouth?  Aren't the gay folks a little bit more knowledgeable on the topic of gay sex?

I've known a few gay and bi folks that have really appreciated V for Vendetta.  Here, in Louisiana, there are people who think that one day God will bless America with a pharmaceutical cure for perversity.  There are people, under 16 and legally kids, in mental institutions, because their parents couldn't handle them being gay.  So, maybe the movie's tone is too preachy.  It's not too loud.  It might be stumble over it's words, but you cannot ask this movie to put down its megaphone because it's tongue is twisted.  What it has to say, should not be whispered.

Jesus was beautiful.  God is beautiful.  You can be beautiful.  You do not have to hate who you are.  God is love and truth.  I have intellectuals frown on me for saying that I'm Christian.  Why?  I have to explain to them that Bruno was Christian, Joan of Arc was Christian, William Blake was Christian.  I look into a glass darkly, but I want to and will one day see God face to face, as he sees me.  Christianity has turned so far away from this.

Fundamentalists cower together in darkness, huddled under blankets sown from complacency.  They burn broken dreams and forbidden books in a bonfire to keep warm.  They shut their eyes tight so truth, change, and decay can't intrude on their static world of crumbling fear.  They think in the darkness they found God.  They go to kiss him, but they've loved under the threat of hell.  They've loved at the end of the barrel of a gun.  And now they find their lips pressed to that barrel.  And before they pull the trigger themselves, someone has to wake them up.

You are not the contagious mental illnesses you've mistaken for your true self.

You are beautiful.

7763151,5,B01GJQM5JM,"PILOJ is the acronymn for ""Proscription In Lieu Of Justice"". Proscription means banishment. And, here, in ""V For Vendetta"", where govt killing is to be avenged, and where justice is impossible, V's penalty for banishment is death.

Until justice is done... We are, of course, in the twisty-turny world of justifying vigilante killings. When a govt does not protect citizens from murder, when a govt is instead responsible for the murder of its citizens; when a govt does not protect citizen rights, when a govt instead violates its citizen rights; when a govt's representatives act as though they live above the law and do not obey the Constitution, then justice must be considered to be impossible.  And, the vigilante may properly contend, if those conditions hold, then that govt's claim to the consent of its citizens is forfeit, and that govt is illegitimate until justice is done.

When authorities have made justice impossible, when they've wired down a society's pressure cooker's safety valve--stopping all possibility of change--and then have cranked up the heat by continually disobeying the Constitution, there's only one result to be sanely expected.

Americans are there, doing that.  Stories such as ""V For Vendetta"" give us a basis for discussion, a point of departure for speculation.

Vigilante killings, in some pure sense, are wrongful murders.  You cannot take the law into your own hands when you live under the rule of law.  If you do, then you must expect to pay the piper.

However--no matter how genuine the rule of law seems to be at the time--every era has many persons who think they live above the law, as well as many persons who live outside the law.  Such persons can always arrange circumstances in which their killings--their wrongful taking of lives--makes justice impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain.  It's the way of the world and has been since the earliest codifications of law.  Well--with the sole exception of Switzerland, the only nation in which democracy is directly in the hands of the people at all jurisdictional levels.

If we, as ordinary citizens, with no ability to make justice happen under our govt, banish a wrong-doer and his/her helpers from our society, we can choose any penalty for the banishment that we choose.  If the person is clearly guilty of robbery, not murder, we may penalize him/her by taking wealth--money and property.  If the person is clearly guilty of wrongfully taking lives, then killing that person and his/her helper(s) is arguably justifiable.

And so, into the twisty-turny world of vigilante killings.

The fictional man called ""V"" lives under a totalitarian govt that has proven itself to him to be guilty of many murders.  It's a fascist govt very similar to Hitler's Germany, the infamous 3rd Reich.  Under such govts, ordinary people cannot make justice happen.

After his near-thing escape from a research center--in which a lethal virus and its cure were developed, killing dozens--V watches as the politician-killers take many tens of thousands of lives with their own cureable virus.  He then prepares himself for about twenty years, and then jumps up his campaign to topple the totalitarian govt.

He blows things up and kills as needed to keep himself free.  Under the cloak of state-controlled news media, he kills men and women whom he knows are directly guilty of wrongful death.  He also kills their helpers, for example, policemen. Ultimately, he cuts down the criminal govt's topmost leaders.

Killing helpers is a bit of a stretch legally, but those who aid others in wrongful killing are themselves part of the ""felony murder"" conspiracy.  So V's killing of the regime's policemen--as with Robin Hood's killing of ""the Sheriff's men"" in the late 12th Century--is arguably the killing of those guilty of conspiratorial felony murder and therefore arguably justifiable.

You don't step very far away from Robin Hood in any dealings with vigilante justice.  The History Channel's priceless documentary, ""The Real Robin Hood"", should be on the viewing list for anyone chewing on vigilante justice.  Sure, it's probably a grautuitous hype for the Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe movie, ""Robin Hood"".  But it's the outlaw's backstory, no matter how far in the future the outlaw runs with his vigilante justice.  Surprisingly, Crowe's touchstone of Robin Hood's taking rights and liberties from the rich and giving those to the poor so that justice can be done is ""spot on"", as the Brits say, for today's needs.

In any event, the key here is that V's killings are punishment for murders done by a govt that protects itself and its cronnies and under which justice is impossible.  V's unsurprising intention is to take that liberty-set from the rich and powerful and then to give it to the poor and ordinary citizens.  Hello, justice.  Hello, Crowe and Scott.  Hello, Robin Hood.

That govt's self-protectiveness and illegal caring for its rich and powerful cronnies is, in fact, very similar to the US govt since the Reagan administrations in the 1980s.  (See especially, ""Inside Job"", the 2011 Oscar-winning Best Documentary of the Year, which covers the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown.)  The similarity of govts is what makes the movie, ""V For Vendetta"", an important topic of discussion and point of departure for ordinary Americans.

The movie is done in a ""filmatic graphic novel"" syle, according to the filmmakers themselves.  I didn't notice any filmatic nod to the graphic novel until V's final fight, you know, when he brings his daggers to a gunfight.  Then the filmatic comic book effects fairly jump off the screen at you.  The spun and hurled daggers are given the same visual after-images that you expect to see on a comic book's pages.  Yes, it's CGI to die for.

The film's story is based on a ten-issue comic book series and given the ""graphic novel"" upgrade tag.  It's writers, and certainly the adaptive filmmakers, want it to be seen as something more than comic book logic.

I'm not sure that the story makes it to that next level.  The story has many twists and turns that smack of disjointed, disconnected comic book logic.  Still, the story seems more engaging than something out of the straight, superhero, comic book genre.

Some of the film's core features are things that our today's revolutionaries need to digest.  Given the belief of enough people, V says, a symbol--say the blowing up of a building--can change the world.  When V's bomb blows up the buildings of Parliament at the end--punctuated by a great sprong from the airborne Big Ben clock--the implication is that he's successfully involved enough people to bring down the V-decaptivated govt.

Revolutionaries, make a note.  Rule one is seeing democracy done.  It's doers must be seen by its other doers--directly and beyond the reach of the sniveling superrich or their parasitic politicians.  All the great democracy movements share this seeing.  In the end, V-the-filmatic-graphic-novel shows the needed seeing of democracy done.

V For Vendetta has lots of great Orwellian type themes, but it still comes across as far too simplistic and dumbed down for the masses.

First of all, if you can get past the ridiculous mask and '60s mop top Peter Tork haircut of V (and why in the scene at the pub when this V guy first appears that not a single patron makes as wisecrack about the fop in the ridiculous mask is so beyond me it's mindboggling).

The action is definitely good. The casting is brilliant. John Hurt (hey, 1984 and all) as the Orwellian leader of Britain was perfect as was the SCTV-like telescreen he talks through. The Stephens--Fry and Rea--were inspired. Again Britain seems bereft of actresses such that yet another American must play an English heroine (Natalie Portman, come on down).

As far as the extras, all you get is a 15-minute ""Making Of"" which is good but spends a little too much time trying to tell us how there are parallels in this graphic novel to the post-911 world.

Movie review:
V for Vendetta has been probably one of the most influential films in the past 10 years. It has a very ""anti-government"" theme that resonates with many people; conservatives and liberals alike. Released during the second George W. Bush administration, this movie depicts the fascist state that England becomes if the Nazis had won WWII. It stars Hugo Weaving as the shadowy avenger known only as ""V"" and Natalie Portman who plays news reporter Evey Hammond. Evey and V meet when Evey is attacked by some of the state's henchmen.

7763179,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V for Vendetta at its core is a story about Humanity.  It is about the greed, corruption, and inhuman approach to civilization and the self-aware awakening of those whom once thought themselves too small to make a difference.

In short, the performances are almost entirely flawless, save for a few instances of dialogue that leaves something to be desired.  The production quality truly shows in fantastic environments and views of tomorrow's London.  James McTeigue paved the way for an outstanding feature with far too little recognition for what it represents.

You do not have to be an activist or part of the underground intelligencia to enjoy this film, but most certainly you will enjoy it more if you understand the message.  Through its action, its clever use of cunning dialogue, and its pro-Humanist message, practically anyone can get behind this modern day Zorro.

The film and book both serve inspirations to the ""anarchic terrorist"" organizations of the modern western world.  But make no mistake, the book, movie and dis-organizations inspired by the story are by no means pro-anarchy; they are pro-Human.  The message is change through crowd-sourced cooperation for the greater good, and to prevent the few from ruling the many.

And many people have a point - even 12 years after release, it is still an astoundingly good film on many levels.
However, it is not the Wachowski's best. For that you'd have to turn to this film: an often under-rated masterpiece.

I have watched this film 10 times and can honestly say that the dialogue is second only to Shakespeare (who is quoted in this more than any other modern film I've seen). Furthermore this film radiates soul and has enough raw political clout to have founded its own unintentional mass movement: Anonymous.

Like the Matrix, the plot revolves around a messiah/ hero figure in the form of 'V' and is told from the perspective of the appropriately named 'Evey'.
Having not (yet) read the graphic novel, I cannot tell how much of the basic plot comes from Alan Moore and how much from the Wachowski's. Indeed it is said that Alan Moore can't stand this film since 'V' is an anarchist in the novel and is more of a freedom fighter for democracy here (Alan Moore has said on record that 99% of problems are caused by 'leaders').

Despite the feelings of the author, I'd say the adaptation was first rate and the film stands tall as a testament to democracy and truth. The message is so clear that, even after George W Bush has gone and terrorist scaremongering has faded, the film still stands out as a classic.

It has certainly become my favourite film and I hope I've made a good case for it being the Wachowski's best. Still, if you haven't seen it, please do and make up your own mind.

7763185,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece! And, I really love how it just rips the whole fear fueled by the media/fascist government/terrorism by our own government wide open. It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a facist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created.

This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a facist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country! I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!

People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".

We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes!

This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast!

I didn't really care for Natalie Portman's accent, and her acting seemed really stiff at times, but the film looks beautiful and is enjoyable enough for its own merits.",1301529600,,549,4.288461538461538
7763191,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Since the ascendancy of Obama, I have used the title above to describe the vision of Obama and the totalitarian wing of the Democratic Party.  The ultimate expression of this vision is their rhetoric of Republicans as enemies of society, and the transformation of individuals from people into wasteful consumers of social resources in the form of healthcare, when such resources can be used to ""better"" society, a waste that the government must control.  (Betterment of society is a truth only the state can know).  The Obama vision of healthcare is well expressed publicly in Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel's graph of an individual's worth to society and corresponding worth for medical services.  Both babies and the elderly in Obama's vision will receive the least amount of healthcare due to their least value status to society.  To maintain infant mortality statistics, an infant will not be considered born for 24 hours and not contribute to mortality statistics unless dead after living into the second day.

The movie V for Vendetta is an amazing replication of the Obama, Pelosi and Reid vision for America.  Unbridled power by the state and the party that controls the state (explaining Obama, Pelosi and Reid's most violent opposition to justices and judges who do not believe in the Democratic Party totalitarian vision). The movie describes the sycophantic support of Obama, Pelosi and Reid by the mainstream media.  The movie makers anticipated  the future turn in American politics in the election of Obama and the control of the American federal government by the totalitarian Democratic Party.

Yet all is not lost, the movie also anticipated the Tea Party the grassroots up rising of ordinary people against the totalitarian vision of the Democratic Party.  Most amazing a movie.

It is OK, but very stylised and the story seems a little aimless in places (hence the 4 stars). Hugo Weaving does an admirable job portraying his characters sentiments whilst restricted by a mask throughout and Natalie Portman does a good job with a rather poor character that seems to change her temperament a touch too frequently to be believable. For fans of action movies and graphic novels this should keep you entertained, at least as you pick holes in it afterwards!! Worth a viewing, but don't expect too much and you should be fine.

But once I reread it in the late 90s...I got it! This movie is spot on, in regards to the book. And the director truly pulled off the look and feel of the book in this film. At times the movie may seem to drag, but what you must remember is, this was written at a time when people had patience to read, and a willingness to think. I'm not attacking the current Hollywood mindless romps, but they don't make thought-provoking movies anymore. This movie was based on a thought-provoking comic book, and loosely based on historical occurrences.

Natalie Portman is as delicious as ever (another plus for the guys) though the direction on the camera work was poor in that, as so many do for some reason, they kept cutting off her feet.  And often the top of her head too. She was barefoot in many of the scenes, but that opportunity was missed by the narrow camera angle.

7763209,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I haven't read the graphic novel (though I should) but the film is a masterpiece of execution, bringing together a tightly-knitted plot, a tremendous cast of actors and some truly memorable visuals. V is a cinematic giant that transcends the melodramatic elements that dog many comic book adaptations, and manages to tread the line of raising complex political issues while capably keeping the audience in suspense every step of way.

The main character, ""V"", is a model for every citizen - unchanged, unhinged, unwavering - he stands for ideas with a steadfast motivation that's both simple and admirable, against a backdrop of a totalitarian Great Britain as a portent of things to come. V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that. It's remarkable how Hugo Weaving manages to convey the entire character without the audience ever seeing his face. Similarly, Natalie Portman is perfect in her role as a scared citizen who overcomes her fear of the system and develops a sense of true freedom.

It's a great movie that's as important as it is well-made. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack from Dario Marianelli that just lifts the soul and underscores the transformative and inspirational message of the film.",1284422400,4,1282,4.985981308411215

Thought-provoking, intense, and confusing for the undereducated, this movie has its twists and turns, and if you're one of those paranoid people that's afraid the government is watching you, this is the movie for you. Originally Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel before this movie even came out, but he doesn't like the notorious hollywood all too well to have his name listed as the writer.

The two main characters share an interesting relationship, and government is in more of a national socialist form in this movie, yet it also constitutes stereotypes and ethnic hate, something...hmm... some governments do today! This movie will make you realize there are people out there that will rise up against the masses for what they believe is right and wrong, and let me tell you folks, the power that one vigilante can do to influence a whole nation, he opened their eyes to the corruption and immorality their government held with it.

It also makes us realize that the word 'terrorist' is thrown around excessively, if someone earns this title by simply standing up for what they believe in, and let's just say anyone hearing that word labeled to someone is not only a stereotype, but it makes a default hate for anyone who hears it about this person.

All in all, this movie makes me think of what could be, what is and what could have been of this world. And what creates the chaos and hate of this world. Watch it, it's an awesome movie.",1281571200,,1670,4.689419795221843
7763212,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I am a big fan of anything and anyone that asks WHY.  It is the type of question ridiculed, and least easily answered.  This movie brings to the forefront how a government can quickly go from the minimal required to ensure that free trustworthy citizens can go about their life, to an overprotective, lying, ends justifies the means tyrant system.

I do find it ironic that it takes place in England, a monarchy.  I thought for sure the only better setting would be the republic of the united states of america, or the republic of france.  That is my only critique, as the film does a great job at questioning what is worth losing freedom for...  Money, security?...  These will evaporate, and you will only be left with a tyrant society.  SO WHY do we allow it???

I think I know, but I don't want to be just another person using Amazon reviews to make a political point today.  All in all, it is a great film.  Enjoy...",1280707200,2,921,4.4226190476190474

We do live in a world where the majority of the people are silent, because they lack the conviction to say something.  We do live in a world where governments silently threaten the majority.  We are in a world where governments do not act on behalf of the people [who voted them in], but instead act on their own agendas.  We do live in a world, where sometimes a vendetta by those agrieved by political hurts is the only way of expression.  Hopefully this film wakes the silent majority up!

It is the same reason a demagogue like Adam Sutler (John Hurt) was elected by a landslide and why the British public, by a 95% vote, surrendered their rights and individualism.

 The cause of the fear was the direct result of the ""birth"" of the character ""V"" in camps established by the government where imprisoned ""different"" were taken for biological experiment. The result was a ""super virus"" which Sutler's ""spider"" planted at a school, a water supply facility, and a subway station that killed an estimated 100,000 citizens.

 Of the ""degenerates"" the character ""V"" survives to wreak vengeance of those guilty for both his metamorphosis, the death of a person he held dear, and the biological terror that brought the ""Norsefire Party"" to power.

Then agin, if you think Obama is losing his mind then you could just switch him in for the character running the governement and you'll be set.

7763245,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is a visually striking, politically challenging, memorable film. Natalie Portman plays Evey, a very vulnerable ""everywoman"" who gets caught up in forces she doesn't understand or appreciate. Portman is in almost every scene, and for much of the film is the only character you can truly see (there either are no other characters, or other characters are masked). For those who only remember her as Padme in the Star Wars films, she has a chance to show a much broader range of abilities, and is impressive.

The plot draws heavily on contemporary themes, including uneasiness over Britain's very highly developed video surveillance system as well as the US Patriot Act limitations on civil rights. Add in some not-so-veiled references to Guy Fawkes, and movie trailers that gave away much of the action, and you have a film in which you know how it turns out (you think), but are constantly wondering how it will get there.

Blu-ray definitely has better exponents of its image capabilities, but this one does not let you down, just do not expect something like you see in Batman The Dark Knight, it is more like Batman Begins in Blu-ray.

This film claims to be an update on said story. But aparently update means they must skew a balanced look at polotics as a concept into an onslaught on the bush campaign.

7763248,3,B01GJQM5JM,"For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel -- a ""comic book"" -- and they immediately write it off as juvenile. Some of us know better, though. The fact that the story a movie came from appeared first in another graphic medium has very little to do with anything. You have to evaluate the film on its own merits. This one is a combination of adventure fantasy -- bigger-than-life hero vs. superbad villains -- and political cautionary tale. It's a couple of decades in the future, the U.S. has collapsed economically and politically and is mired in civil war, and England has fallen into an authoritarian, fascist nightmare, largely with the acquiescence of its own people. Into all this steps a man in a Guy Fawkes mask with a vendetta against those in power for what they did to him in his earlier life. In the book, V's cause is anarchy; in the film, it's English freedom. (Alan Moore loathed the change in theme as ""Americanization,"" but revolution plays better in Hollywood if it's in support of democracy.) Though we never see the real, damaged face of V, the voice behind the mask is that of Hugo Weaving -- and a great voice it is, too. Natalie Portman plays Evey, the only survivor of a family that was wiped out piecemeal by the fascists, and the story also is about her climb up from constant fear. John Hurt is excellent as Sutler, the frothingly menacing Head Chancellor who glares out from an oversize TV screen like Big Brother in ""1984."" There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high-security places to commit his executions. On the other hand, the Wachowski brothers also were responsible for the ""Matrix"" films, so you know the sfx are going to be above average -- especially the final shoot-out in the tube station and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament as witnessed by thousands of Londoners in Guy Fawkes masks. Not a bad flick, and it's obviously destined to be a cult film, but it would have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book.",1257811200,,2125,4.522077922077922

7763250,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Accidentally it happens that an innocent and unsuspecting young woman is abducted by a masked terrorist who holds the nation's capital in his grip.  That's it.

And this screenplay was written almost ten years before its release.  The Warchawski brothers created THE MATRIX films first.  And in them all, Hugo Weaving; quite a step up, here, in my opinion, from those interminable, overwrought English pixie movies in elfin-babble starring Elija Wood and everybody else but him.

No, I don't need to have read any of the Lloyd/Moore graphic novels, I think.  There are so many of these masterpieces of literary comics around nowadays, and everybody's doing them.  But, a movie is still just a shadowplay.  Nevertheless, it is always an event to see John Hurt in anything: The inquisitive First Officer from ALIEN, or THE ELEPHANT MAN, or the distinguished seducer from LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND, or HELLBOY's adoptive earth-father from the movie of the same name, or as the victim/narrator from 1984.  That man's got something hardly any actor has; he can absolutely grip you and convince you of what he's doing within five minutes of any story.  And you absolutely cannot forget him.  Not even remotely attractive, but fascinating.

The movie V has (English) political and even historical overtones, based as it is on Guy Fawkes Day -- that's the annual holiday the English celebrate the attempted destruction of Parliament -- but the dotty Baroness Thatcher is gone, nonetheless, though not forgotten, and Britain is now Labor and the flow of cash out of England to Enron in Texas has ceased.  One hopes.  But nobody need be aware of any of that on first watching.  V is very skillfully written, in that regard, so that whatever might slow things down to political mud wrestling is avoided, and the action is allowed to move at a brisk pace.  All the elements of the story; the Dictator and his cronies; the police; the constabulary SWAT goons; the unintended female hostage/victim/accomplice (the sympathetic, winsome Natalie Portman) and her abductor/guru/hero (velvet-voiced Hugo, always in disguise) are in evidence and work as a team to reveal the story as it tightens and coils toward its inevitable end.

V is very easy to watch and understand.  Exciting to look at, the story, it seems to me, is a meditation on this proposition:  Cromwell liberated England from its Monarch and its aristocracy, but the Parliament, once it was free to do so sold the people to the nobility which has kept them enslaved ever since.  The pertinent question is, what a nation would England be were the English people free to work for their benefit alone?  And that causes us to wonder what a nation the United States of America would be, were this nation allowed to prosper for the benefit of all its citizens, equally?",1255910400,,2814,4.906976744186046

7763253,5,B01GJQM5JM,"When this movie first came out, we were still in the middle of George Bush's 2nd term and the war in Iraq was not going so well.  So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this ""fascist"" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.

As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is ""People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people.""  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit ""right-wingish"" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but ""right-wing""), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.

7763258,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I saw the movie first, read the book after, and then watched the film again.  The creators of this film took intelligence and delicacy into making a nearly flawless adaptation.  Reason Being?  Material that didn't make it to film is what would have destroyed it.  V for Vendetta is not a word for word translation.  V the film is a updated and different approach with everything that was the heart and soul of the book.  They snipped and cut what they needed to and added fresh material to give the film more substance.

I really feel sorry for Alan Moore after the LXG movie.  It really did no justice to him, and it did not display any of his writing talent.  V for Vendetta however is bleeding with Moore dialogue.  More than half of the films dialogue comes straight from the graphic novel, and it's really inspiring to see a hollywood movie do justice like that.  And even the new and different scenes compliment the Alan Moore setting like you never would have guessed.  Graphic novels like Watchmen and V are very cinematic but not everything can translate to film.  Although it was nearly the same, the Watchmen picture did have a entirely different ending.  This is simply because you can do different things in books that you can't in film.

Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman?  Who would have thought? This duo turned out to be the best idea the film had.  I'm not familiar with the other actors but they certainly deserve more and more screen time in their future.  Portman is significantly different from the girl in the novel, but it was a smart move for the film.  The independent and thought-provoking Evey in the film is way more interesting and inspiring than the girl in the book. Giving her a smarter role really gave the audience something more interesting.  And Hugo?  What can I say? Hugo has never basterdized a role in a film.  He was spot on with V.

V for Vendetta is one of the benchmark comic book movies that really got it right.  After seeing this I regained hope for all adaptations, because this one director thought to preserve the art of the book, and not just sell it.  We really take for granted how much these people work to make a film an artwork, when one can simply just sell it with action, effects, and sexuality.

7763265,3,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amuck in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers.  This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.  While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through.  Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.  The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel.  The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film.  ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered.  Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.

With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film?  To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly.  The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended.  Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.  The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character.  ""V"", with this film, became iconic.  Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded ""V"".  The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak.  ""V"" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control.  Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character - and then there was Portman.  While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.  Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding.  These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.

""V for Vendetta"" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals.  It is a thinking film.  It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments.  It will keep your mind occupied for hours.  McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting.  As mentioned before, what makes ""V for Vendetta"" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film - it moved it in a different direction.  Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought - but it isn't a complete masterpiece.  I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today - the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time.  Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.

""V"" wants revenge for what was done to him -- he was one of many experimented on by a woman doctor who thought she was doing viral research and could not understand why the patients (i.e., prisoners, undesirables, etc.) would ignore her.  Talk about being in denial!  Lakehill Sanitarium developed a virus that was let loose on the country, which helped bring The High Chancellor to power.  And power he has.

The surveillance trucks listening in on all conversation; the curfew police who have no problem attempting rape on any girls who happen to pass by.  The USA is into its Second Civil War, and so on.  Quite a society!

The very philosophy behind this movie is sick and twisted.  Of course, Hugo Weaving is a great actor even when he is forced to act from behind a Guy Fawkes mask (I think that's what it was), and Natalie Portman is good, but it's not her best role.

7763277,1,B01GJQM5JM,"If it were merely a precautionary tale about a society lulled into totalitarian rule, I could recommend this movie as a well made, fun bit of eye candy.  There are certainly a lot of elements here to like. Specifically, the story telling is extremely effective, and the visual effects are stunning.  Despite all this, ""V For Vendetta"" is wrecked by it's absolutley relentless ranting against nationalism, conservatism, and to a lesser extent Christianity.  In particular it is a soup-to-nuts diatribe against the United States war on terror, and is intended to inform us that supposed Islamic acts of terror were actually manufactured by conservatives in order to enslave the nation and exterminate homosexuals and artists.

I won't bother to enumerate the twisted parallels between the movie plot and the war on Islamic terrorism.  I'm sure they have been identified and argued to death already.  I would like to point out however, that as of the date I am writing this review, the world is now safe from George W. Bush, who has quietly ridden off into the sunset, just like all previous U.S. presidents.

A side note: The 1934 movie adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is referenced multiple times through out ""V For Vendetta"".  The 2002 movie adaptation is excellent and highly recommended.

V for Vendetta strikes me as a well-scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once. But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his ""quest"" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations. Aside from the obvious parallel between he and The Count of Monte Cristo, I particularly find the whole ""rebellion against authority"" theme to be a refreshing testament to the way certain governments can sometimes be a bit too controlling or ironically nave for their own good, which in turn can cause said revolution. This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long. And as history (or even science) has proven, for every action, there is indeed an equal and opposite reaction; authority <--> rebellion. But in one of the more unique twists, this revenge and rebellion is all catalyzed under the guise of a Guy Fawkes-masked vindicator whose actions also indeed can fit that of a textbook terrorist. 9/11 undertones are easily apparent when they mention the symbol of a building being destroyed and its ability to change the world for better or worse. I don't know when this graphic novel was written, but apparently the symbolism is justifiably and eerily accurate for what it's worth. I suppose it just depends on which side you're coming from and the amount of subjectivity involved when trying to observe such events. But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The only problems I had were a few pacing issues with the screenplay, that might've been better resolved with either a longer run time or more immersing musical score.

Video - 3.5

Presented in VC-1 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, I took a look at the bitrates (mostly in the high teens and low 20s) and it appears Warner Bros. used the exact same transfer from the previously released HD-DVD (aka the more inferior release). After reading the BD review of Batman Begins, I am now convinced that during the format war, some movies may have unexpectedly gotten the shaft in terms of a faithful transfer/encode. Because of the mere max capacity of 30GBs on a dual-layered HD-DVD, there wasn't as much space for as good a transfer/encode. The result: a few movies not quite meeting up to BD expectations LIKE a Batman Begins, V for Vendetta, and whatever else I might have in my library that was caught up in the war. Needless to say, while the BD presentation here is good, it's probably nowhere near as good as it could be. Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly-encoded, titles. Sharpness is around what you'd expect for an HD presentation, but some scenes looked a tad grainy and fuzzy (and not the good kind, like a Bourne Identity on BD, which by the way was re-encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates). Blacks aren't particularly deep either, which is a shame as it's a pretty dark movie. I'm disappointed, but it's better than DVD anyway...

Audio - 4.0

In addition, this TrueHD 5.1 track also seems to be a direct copy of the HD-DVD's. I don't have any HD-DVDs to compare, but I've heard other Warner Bros. titles with the same option, and they are remarkably more in depth than what we're given on this BD. Most of the film is dialogue and comes through very crisp (not that it should be hard), but the more action-focused scenes were lacking in surround usage. Music (one of the problems I had with the film overall) also seems less immersing than I'd like (where at least Batman Begins had a terrific score). LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes. It's not quite up to snuff with other BDs having only an average bitrate between 1.6 and 2.1Mbps, but it's better than regular Dolby Digital.

Extras - 3.5

I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind-the-scenes footage concerning production and writing, but I felt there weren't enough. The one segment making comparisons between V and a terrorist is especially interesting, though they could've offered a little more subjectivity to the ideas and overall concepts of what this could represent in society. All features are in SD.

Overall - 4.0

I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre -- to essentially portray the hero as a terrorist. Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film. But regardless, the plot itself touches upon many subtleties about authority, self-will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc. I highly recommend this for the great story. But with only an average A/V transfer thanks to HD-DVD's inferiority and the laziness of Warner Bros. studios to do a proper re-encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles.",1233705600,11,5294,4.7519042437431995

7763299,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Having not read the graphic novel on which this movie is based, I cannot (and would not) debate the faithfulness of the adaptation or its relative worth.  I also cannot divine what the Wachowski brothers' intent or motivations might have been, especially regarding the current political climate.  I can only relate what I witnessed and experienced from the film alone as an isolated piece of art, and it was good... profoundly so.

The film does not dabble with subtleties or nuances.  The regime in charge of Britain is clearly oppressive.  However they came to power and whatever their motivations (and the film ultimately reveals the back story), it is clear that they rejoice in their complete authority and enthusiastically abuse it.  The field agents or Fingermen violate the citizenry; the televised face of the nation self-righteously revels in the judgment heaped upon other nations spewing smug vitriol; the religious leaders fulfill their carnal desires; the communications ministry controls all programming twisting the news to its own ends while eavesdropping on the general population; the Chancellor clearly rules through fear and with an iron fist.  Dissidents are quickly and quietly disposed of through violent means.  Free thought does not exist.  This is an archetypal oppressive evil regime.

V is the faceless archetypal hero.  Happily he remains faceless for the duration of the movie.  His mask is all we see.  The lifeless mask allows for his thoughts and ideas to be the focus rather than his individuality.  His appeal is not so much for how he handles a fight and a blade, though impressive; his true weapon is speech.  Eloquent and literate, he expresses ideas that cut straight to the heart (the people should not fear their government, but the government should fear its people).  Suspend belief for a period and watch as he shakes a sleeping nation.  He chastises the citizens as the true culprits that have allowed the current state of affairs.  Then he provides inspiration and a means  to do something about it.  We see the cowardly and zombie-like nation slowly awaken and climactically throw off its oppressor.

This is not a ""how-to"" tool for overthrowing a dictatorship.  Nor is it in my opinion a scathing indictment of any administration or specific political landscape in the first decade of the 21st century (though it will make you think about some things).  Its power is in the universality of the tale.  It resonates because it does not have to be political at all.  It is about people and oppression and anyone finally standing up to throw off tyranny in any of its forms by whatever means.  Certainly violence works well for a movie and to dramatically represent the point.  But do not lock the greater meaning and power of the message into its form.  Speaking of its universality, I was very much reminded of the musical ""Les Miserables"" (precursor to the French Revolution).  It is a rousing tale where one sacrifices self-interest for the greater good.

The cinematography is phenomenal with its stark colorization; it is a visually stunning film.  The action is entertaining.  A more rousing tune than the ""1812 Overture"" cannot be found.  The film slows slightly while providing some back story, but it is necessary to fully inform the narrative.

Indeed, this film voices a vortex of vile violence surrounding vintage virtuality.

Starring the vainglorious Hugo Weaving (a vigilante Elrond); and Natalie Portman, who needs to be more voluptuous.  Yet each scene is stolen by vulgar John Hurt, who proves to be a most violent, vitriolic villain.  Stephen Rea is just, kind of there, but I vigress, er digress.

""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door, only this, and nothing more.""

So I answered the door, and it was a messenger. He handed me a package, made me sign a paper, I hope I wasn't selling my soul or something (I don't have a soul to sell, it will be breach of contract and I may be sued) and he leave as fast as he arrived. So I entered my house, put the package on a coffee table, and forgot it 'till the very next day. And the very next day I remembered the package.

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,in there stepped a stately mask of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door, perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door, perched, and sat, and nothing more.

It was V's mask. It is a small mask, just the appropriate size for the bust of Pallas I have in my library. So I made Pallas to wear V's mask, and then I enjoyed the movie. Apart from the mask and the movie, the package has a few mementos: four postcard sized posters of the movie, and V's symbol. The second disc includes the making of V, interviews and a lot of stuff, while the movie itself, widescreen, has three languages for audio and closed captioning (French, English and Spanish) allowing me to practice two languages and still enjoy it in my mother tongue. A nice touch. I've framed the lobby cards and they are hanging in my walls. I like them.

In the 1980s comic books took a revolutionary turn (one the likes of which had not been seen since the `60s and `70s) and became politically and socially relevant again. These were the days of conservative and consumerist values, when Ronald Reagan was president and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. A Cold War was being fought and the lines between freedom fighter and terrorist, democracy and imperialism were quickly dissipating. It was in this political climate that David Lloyd and Alan Moore created&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/V-for-Vendetta/dp/140120841X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">V for Vendetta</a>, a highly intelligent graphic novel series. V for Vendetta was brilliantly written and illustrated and helped to prove that comic books weren't just for children; they were literature. The film V for Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel and was written by the Wachowski Brothers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Matrix-Trilogy/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Matrix Trilogy</a>).

""As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality.""
-Karl Marx

In a bleak totalitarian future, Britain has become a cesspool for corruption, conformity and brutality. People's civic rights are being severely violated by the government, under the leadership of Chancellor Sutler. The people are misguided, apathetic, and fearful of the harsh regime that rules over them but that's about to change. One night a young woman named Evey is caught by corrupt police officers after curfew. They intend to rape her but astonishingly (or predictably, if you're a comic book expert) she is saved by a costumed vigilante, who wears an antiquated mask of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guy-Fawkes/dp/0385471904/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guy Fawkes</a>. His name is V and he has a deep hatred of the current government, a hatred that was born when he was tortured and experimented upon. He invites Evey to join him on the rooftops fro a ""concerto"" which he will conduct himself. Reluctantly she agrees to go and there she watches in shock and amazement as V detonates the Old Bailey. The next day a police squad is sent to obtain her for questioning but V shows up and saves her... sort of. He takes her back to his underground lair where he makes her breakfast and asks her to join him in his revolution. She agrees but only does so with the intention of escaping. V uses Evey to gain access to his targets but she manages to get away. Soon she is caught and arrested. She spends months in a small gloomy cell being tortured and interrogated before she is released and learns to master her fear. Meanwhile Chancellor Sutler increases his power over the population by overwhelming them with misinformation in the media. He utilizes scare tactics and military force to keep any dissidents in line but the people grow quietly more rebellious. V has promised them a revolution will commence on November the 5th and he has planned to liberate them and avenge those who have been wronged. But is he a lunatic or a hero, a guerrilla freedom fighter or a monstrous killer? Maybe he is all of those things as well as being the only hope for ending Chancellor Sutler's wicked regime... and yet at what cost?

""One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.""
-Martin Luther King, Jr.

The film is skillfully directed by newcomer James McTeigue and features an amazing cast including Hugo Weaving as V, Natalie Portman as Evey, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler. Other cast members include Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Roger Allam and Sinead Cusack.
V for Vendetta is a disquieting film, a film that is thought provoking and questions authority. It daringly asks questions about the world in which we live but it leaves us to find the answers. The film is understandably controversial, especially in the age of terrorism, distortion in the media, genocide, biochemical warfare and rampant political corruption. The story shows us the dangers of combining religious fanaticism, puritanical thinking, and social intolerance while handing the government complete control. The film certainly won't appeal to many conservatives or centralists. It's an extreme film that attacks extreme problems. Even Alan Moore disassociated himself from it, feeling that the screenplay was not faithful to his story*. Yet despite the film's many flaws it remains very relevant to the issues we face in modern society.

Natalie Portman's acting is so very good.
About an England where a neo-Nazi has come to power;
the use of fear in the classic sense has made a police state
possible: it reminds one very much of the current Bush administration
where 'security' overrides rights.
The prisoner/ experimental subject in cell V in an biological
concentration camp right out Germany at the end of WWII survives.
Like the X-man magneto he has abilities beyond the ordinary,
like seeing without eyes and strength.
The rescue of the young Evie changes him, but not his plan
to overthrow the government on Guy Fawkes Day.",1216944000,,619,4.794392523364486
7763310,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie because it is so thought provoking. Some may watch it and just see it as another action movie, but I feel it is more. It is (as it was intended) a look into a possible (and believable) future where the government has exerted so much control that every facet of life is censored and measured.
When the audience is introduced to V, they simply don't know what to make of him. By the end, some see him as a villain, or terrorist.
Which brings me to the question that makes this movie so worthwhile:
Would you do what he did to save your country?",1216339200,,572,4.256880733944954
7763311,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The graphic Novel was excellent, but apart from that, the blue-ray disc is about as good as you can get outside of seeing this film on IMAX.",1214697600,,140,4.222222222222222
7763312,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This film wasn't what I expected, from what I could glean of it from the cover picture and the blurb on the back of the case. I assumed V had a silent role, and that the film would be set somewhere in the former Communist eastern Europe.

Once I watched it, however, I ended up getting much more than I bargained for. In short, this movie can be interpreted as a very stern warning to those who abuse power---and reminds us who gave them that power. John Hurt plays perfectly the megalomaniacal chancellor who is consumed by a desire to control everything in sight, and Natalie Portman does an excellent job of portraying Evey, who first regrets being caught up in the deadly game V plays with his former tormentors, but finally becomes his willing tool.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie has scenes which appear to be based on events in real life, as well as scenes from other movies. The analogy of the chancellor to Hitler is obvious, with the oversized symbol, marching before the platform, effective use of red and black to reinforce the propaganda effect, and the suggestion of a mentality meant to pervade all; the chancellor's chief servants eventually start to turn on each other, with disastrous results to his cabinet, a clear indictment of the infighting which shook the Bush administration to its core; the subway scene near the end, in which Portman cradles the dying V a la Luke Skywalker toward the end of ""Return of the Jedi""; the ruling party's infuriation at being parodied, so reminiscent of Fidel Castro's ire toward the late cartoonist Antonio Prohias; the ending with thousands of extras which was based on an actual incident in the former Yugoslavia which resulted in the downfall of Milosevic's regime; and V's disguise, his chivalrous manner, and his expertise with blades, so reminiscent of Zorro. V reminds us in brutally graphic fashion why a gentleman should never hit a lady. The only thing absent from real life is the character who holds to account everyone who took part in the conspiracy which brought them to power; presumably, that is the greatest fear of some of our leaders who've failed us (and you know who you are).

As for the plot, I found it easy to follow despite its complexity and the penchant which most British film makers seem to have for dwelling a little too much on drama. About the worst I can say of this movie, however, is that Hugo Weaving as V can be a bit of a motormouth, though an impressively prosy and witty one. We eventually realize that a number of elements are introduced into the plot as it progresses, but the makers of this film do a good job of tying up all the loose ends and bringing the bouquet together, as the villainous party members take to feuding with each other as V picks them off one by one... except for the last, who finds out the hard way what it will be like to live in a changed world in which he is stripped of his power. Can you say ""emotionally castrating""?

The crowning virtue of this film is the question of V's true identity. We realize at the end that the question is a moot point, but we still want to see the man behind the mask. But then, V wouldn't want me to spoil the ending, now would he?

I fully recommend this film. Control freaks will find it traumatizing, but I daresay the rest of us will find it well worth the price.",1214524800,,3352,4.515650741350906

It would have been much better if the government was being oppresive based on environmentalism or a police state for ""our security"".  Small gripe, but a gripe none-the-less.

7763316,5,B01GJQM5JM,"While there's plenty of action in this movie, there's also a lot of deeper meaning. Questions that I think are very relevant, especially now.
For instance the idea that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. For me it gives some insight into the current situation in the middle east. The 'terrorists' don't think of themselves that way, they actually do think of themselves as fighting for the freedom of their people [at least most of the rank and file]. Trying to shuck the yoke of oppression that's kept them in poverty for so long.
[though I suspect that the people really oppressing them are their leaders; using various other targets as a scapegoat to divert suspicion from themselves the true oppressors]
But the scene that most resonates with me is after Evie [SPOILER ALERT!] has her revelation. After V tortures her, making her believe that Creedy's fingermen had her. When she finally has her epiphany; arms out stretched, looking up into the glory of the thunderstorm. ""God is in the Rain"" [SPOILER OVER]
The archetype of redemption struck right through me. The world changes as revelation pours over you. That moment comes I hope to all of us at one time or another, and the scene evokes it with shocking clarity.

I thought the acting was great for what it was, the cinematography was excellent (probably my favorite aspect of the movie), The direction was intriguing, and the story was overall decently solid and thought-provoking.

The only problem I had with the movie was its tendency to become a bit full of itself.  By this I mean resorting to being a bit melodramatic at times and jauntily wacky at other times.  The flow was a bit odd.  The tendency for politicos to latch on to this film as if it were the all-encompassing life giving teet of the one true god has tarnished this movie for a lot of people in the same manner that goth out the bum tweens ruined The Crow.

7763323,2,B01GJQM5JM,"This is meant to be a thriller with a revolutionary political message.

It fails to satisfy on both counts.

As a thriller, the anti-hero fights an evil political system, mostly for revenge for the cruelties inflicted on him, but also to bring it down. In doing so, he kills a number of figures in the system and carries out explosions to topple the state. Fair enough. But he seems invincible, almost, and the state pretty powerless, even though it is supposed to be totalitarian. V is able to distribute a very lareg number of Guy Fawkes masks undetected and to drive a train under Parliament to blow it up. No one is killed in either of these explosions, unlike in real life. Furthermore, how does the masked V supply himself with food?

Politically, this is as subversive as cold porridge. The state is a fascistic one, with an Oswald Mosley figure on top. Its homophobic and racist. How it got to power is explained by a gigantic conspiracy undetected by almost all. It fails to convince. And what happens after the overthrow of the regime? Most revolutions lead to either greater tyranny or a sordid compromise at best.  The film fails to engage here, and simply cops out. We also might wonder how why the apathetic masses suddenly risk death to overthrow the state.

This film is actually in favour of the current liberal status quo, with rights to all, though it does advocate vigiliantism and capital punishment for evildoers. But again, this is not really explored. The fascist bogeyman of the 1930s is the villain of the piece - yesterday's enemy (how daring!).

This is a film which thinks it is clever, but only in an adolescent fashion, which fails to convince on any other level. Having said that, the viewer maintains enough interest to see exactly how it will turn out, because the overthrow of the evil state is inevitable, isn't it?",1207958400,20,1851,4.697530864197531

7763325,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Every once in a while a film comes along that provokes your way of thinking. Fight Club did that in the 90's and this movie does that for this decade. The story follows Evy Hammond (Natalie Portman), who meets a radical who calls himself V, and dressed in the likeness of Guy Fawkes. V exposes the tyranny and treason behind the futuristic government of Norsefire, which rules England with an iron fist. V teaches Evy how to not live in fear of the government, and all the while his plan unfolds to bring a revolution and freedom to the country. There's not a bunch of violence, but when there is you are at full attention to the beautiful directing and cinematography. Oh, and did I mention Hugo Weaving is V? The man known as Agent Smith from The Matrix Trilogy and Elrond from LOTR, is at the top of his game.

Apparently, when Fascism finally comes to Britain its main policy goals will be to outlaw homosexuality and Korans. Naturally, considering this script was written by the perverted Wachowski brothers and based on a comic book by the snake-worshipping degenerate Alan Moore, the guiding philosophies behind their fictional dictatorship is Christianity and conservatism. How utterly asinine. Everyone knows that the road to serfdom is paved with liberal intentions. Tyrannies usually come to power promising Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood, not limited government and an ethos of ""Do Unto Others.""

I'd like to see a movie about the thousands of Western European and Canadian men in prison for thought crimes against the Left, such as questioning the official version of the so-called Holocaust, for writing or speaking out against the homosexual agenda or opposing the immigration invasion of their countries. Who knows where such left-wing oppression will end? A Reign of Terror, a Gulag?

If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.

Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our ""everyman"" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.

What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.""  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.

V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.",1204416000,,2115,5.0

The parallels between the film and reality are truly freighting at times. As a fan of the graphic novel I was disappointed V's political ideologies were purged and the government made far less tyrannical in it's actions.

The performances given by Weaving and Portman are tremendous. For a man whose true face is hidden beneath a mask you feel greater emotion coming from V than you would most unmasked men.

7763333,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V For Vendetta is the rarest of things: A work of art that manages to be both commercially viable and uncompromisingly subversive. It's an arrestingly stylish, devastatingly smart movie whose every scene demands attention and contemplation. Without being preachy or condescending, it demands that its viewers think. Without resorting to cliche or cheap sentiment, it packs a hell of an emotional wallop. Without resorting to cardboard-cutout characterization or vague moralizing (and this is the really cool part), it sends an impossible-to-ignore message about right, wrong, oppression, revolution, responsibility, and the role of the individual.  And at the same time, it's incredibly fun to watch.

The plot is a bit complex (and besides, watching the story unfold is half the fun. Well, more like a third of the fun. But I digress...), but here's what you should know: Our story takes place in an unpleasant future. England has fallen under the power of a very oppressive, very totalitarian regime, which has come to power by riding a wave of fear triggered by a surge in terrorist attacks. Free expression and democracy are things of the past, all information is controlled by the government, anyone who complains winds up disappearing, and God help you if you're a Muslim. What sets this brave new world apart from (and ahead of) other, lesser cinematic dystopias is its incredible atmosphere. This England is a creeping sort of nightmare, a strange and hostile place that evokes dread and paranoia with a throbbing undercurrent of tension. As anyone who's ever been across the pond (for those of you joining us from Europe, Asia, Africa, or Australia, ""on your side of the pond"") can probably tell you, the setting of V For Vendetta is an uncannily dark mirror image of the Isle that we all know and love. It's atmospheric, hypnotic, and undeniably powerful. This setting is populated by an equally engaging cast of heroes and villains- from the charismatic and utterly ruthless High Chancellor Adam Sutler to the oddly sympathetic government inspector Eric Finch to the film's twin protagonists, Evey Hammond and V, just about everybody in this film is a wonderfully drawn, finely crafted example of characterization at its sharpest. It's a stage full of Hamlets  and Mia Wallaces, without a single Jar Jar Binks to ruin the flow.

The story itself, which concerns V's yearlong crusade against the tyranny that has fallen on hi nation, is simply brilliant. V himself is a stunningly drawn character, an incredibly complex man whose cool charisma and literate style belie a troubled, vulnerable sort of humanity. It's not always easy to agree with his methods- he resorts to acts of violence that border on anarchic terrorism- but therein lies the brilliance of the movie: V For Vendetta doesn't aim to make us blindly sympathize with its central character. Rather, it demands that we think, forces us to consider our own views on revolution, freedom, revenge, and violence. Is it right to defy a government if we see its actions as unjust? Can one man's actions speak for the ideas of many? Is it ever right to kill another human being? The questions may be as old as time, but this movie casts them in a startlingly new light.

And it's entertaining, too: The plot is genuinely suspenseful and engaging, full of twists, and revelations. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed, the dialog is razor-sharp, the visuals are unforgettable, and the climax is simply gorgeous. This one oughtta go down as a classic.",1203379200,2,3528,5.044596912521441

Some people might not like it or might need to watch it twice to grasp all that happens.  I love this movie!

The premise of the movie is a bit like George Orwell's 1984 - the government needs to control its people and owns the news stations that report propaganda to the people.  It later comes out that certain people in the government have been terrorizing the people to take away their civil liberties.  This masked man (who was a government test subject - but survived) is out to help inform the public.  It's a matter of if he can get the public to support his revolution.

It pulled at my heart strings, it made my heart beat quicker with action, it had a certain romance about it, and in these strange times of government power grabs it made me stop and think about the world that is being created by our politicians today.

7763340,5,B01GJQM5JM,"In certain opportunity, Benjamin Franklin affirmed: ""When a nation decides to sacrifice their freedom in order to get security, don't deserve to obtain neither one of both"".

In the name of faith, unity, national security, preservation of the ethical ideals, religious beliefs or any other argued concept, a Government has made use of the force and the oppression to offer the people security against all those who intend to break the rules of the status quo.

On the dawn of the Seventieth century, there was a man who died for preserved his own ideals. Four centuries later, V made his appearance. This smart plot combined clever and timely the ancestral legend of the Phantom Opera, the famous Count of Monte Christ, and through a wise game of crossed words and an admirable use of the semiotic, produced an underworld hero, ""V"" . curiously V was the signal of victory used by Churchill, but besides it might be regarded vengeance, virus and violence, who emerges from the sashes and the forgetfulness, who makes a smart plan after a terrible disgrace on Queen Mary's Hospital, as consequence of a failed experiment.

In this sense, one might affirm the urban legend follows the mythical traces where the bad guys belong to the highest sphere of the government, featured by a visible Nazi taste (once more the semiotic lexicon, the use of the flags, the huge manifestations of submission and febrile obedience before the shelter state, the figure of the First Chancellor, who never talks directly to his subordinates, with clear reminiscences of George Orwell's 1984's Big brother)

The rest of the movie runs for you, marvellously edited, magisterially filmed and supported by a tense and unpredictable script will lead the spectator to a chilling and surprising climax, with the accords of 1812 Overture, another semiotic element of well known historical transcendence.

Natalie Portman once more carves in relief her outstanding skills as character actress, Hugh Weaving as V gives a very convincing role and finally the emblematic John Hurt (who precisely was part of the cast of 1984) as the hated Chancellor conform a well-rounded film that will reward even the most exigent of the spectators.

I was quite disappointed to read one of the editorial reviews describing this movie as ""stylish but empty"".  I found this movie to be one of the most thought provoking and emotionally appealing movies made in the last decade. The connections between the characters (Evy, V, Valarie-the girl in the cell next door) are complex and at times heartbreaking.  The movie has an underlying political message that is very relevant today- not just another county's future where the movie is set.  We must be wary of blind faith in our political leaders; fear should not allow us to give away our personal freedom and rights as human beings.  We are not just a number(5 i.e. V) or a sexual preference, creed, etc., we are human beings and we all have our own story to tell.  This is a movie not only about the transformation of a government because of terrorism but how it can change people.

7763350,1,B01GJQM5JM,"This film has been compared to the work of George Orwell..I really doubt that Mr Eric Blair would feel honoured by the comparison. In fact I believe he might be turning in his grave right now, that this juvenile, nasty trash might be promoted in his name.

As a British viewer, this film really jarred with me. Ok, there are lots of explosions, lots of violence, lots of cool allusions to the war on terror, lots of smart references to fuddy duddy old white people and their prejudices and consequently lots of fuddy duddy old white people being brutally killed by our hero. Hey, we even have a dirty old catholic priest character asking if Natalie Portman in kneesocks and pigtails 'is too old', ignoring of course that 99% of the Catholic abuse victims have been boys.  But then we don't want to confuse our distinctions between the 100% evil subhuman paedophiles and the 100% good homosexuals do we? Life should be simple, like a comic book. Or, indeed, like an american Democratic outlook on the world.
But the most obviously jarring element is the fact that the film is set in London, with a facist, right wing government, and yet the film is a crude portrayal I assume, of 'where Dubya is taking us'. It might be difficult for young American Democratic voters to comprehend, but the UK is being led into a nightmare Orwellian state not by a rightwing party, but by a leftwing party, until recently led by Tony Blair.  It was he who, together with Bush, led the invasion of Iraq. It is his government that has made it illegal to even criticise Islam or homosexuality, that is introducing ID cards, that has installed security cameras in nearly every street in the country and that has led to dumbed down, brutal, anamalistic society where half a million of the native populaton flee abroad nearly every year.
But this wouldn't suprise George Orwell, who wrote Animal Farm AND 1984 based on his experience of and consequent disgust of the left's hypocricy, simple-mindedness and refusal to tolerate opposition or dissension.",1199577600,87,2028,4.755681818181818

The rest of you might be correct- this might be a bad adaptation of the original (I didn't even know this was a novels adaptation.) On the stance that I wasn't aware that this was an adaptation or have any idea how the original version was fashioned I must say that this is of the best films- could count them in one hand that I have ever seen. Those who have been exposed to the novel might want to heed or keep the warning given by those that have seen it in mind. The rest of you should watch it and then decide- thats just my opinion though.

There is a fire, and the resettlement camp burns to the ground. One inmate survives, our hero V, who appears to have taken his name from his cell door, which bears the Roman numeral for five, which is ""V"". He now has a vendetta to kill all the high ranking officials that orchestrated the prison and the experiments on the inmates.

The government does create a biological weapon from the program, but instead of using it on the enemy they unleash it on their own citizens to create panic, so that they can have more laws and enforcers.

Due to the fire, V is horribly scared, and dons a Guy Fawkes costume including mask, wig and cape. It's creepy but powerful. Guy Fawkes was also a revolutionary who tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up parliament. Guy Fawkes day, November 5th, is a theme throughout the movie.

V meets our heroine, Evey when he saves her from an evil curfew enforcer. Her life is never the same.

He hijacks a TV station, and gives one of the most moving speeches I've ever heard. His theme is the government should be afraid of it's people, the people shouldn't be afraid of the government. He succeeds in blowing up a building and killing everyone on his list. The government then makes up stories to cover up his actions. He does some really bad things, even to Evey. But in the end, he has an impact on the whole country, as they finally stand up in mass against the government.

7763366,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is one of the very rare movies that offer consistent solutions to reach individual freedom as well as collective freedom.

Evey follows this path to freedom with the help of her master V. After days of suffering and major sacrifices, she starts to see behind the illusion.

The proposed path is interesting because it has nothing to do with the usual ""elightenment recipes"" like pyschedelic drugs, immediate mystical experience, blind faith or hermir-like excapes.

Just one quote about Evey's experience : V to Evey : ""You found something else. In that cell you found something that mattered more to you than life. It was when they threatened to kill you unless you gave them what they wanted... you told them you'd rather die. You faced your death, Evey. You were calm. You were still.""

Meanwhile V works on a broader plan : helping the whole population to get rid of a fascist control.

Here again, the interesting thing is that the solution has nothing to do with the usual revolutionary ""modus operandi"" : no violence, no new regime as cynical as the previous regime, no brainwashing of the masses, no civil war.

The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes ""V,"" a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another ""November, November, the fifth of the November"" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.

Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.

Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. ""V"" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.

""V for Vendetta"" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as ""V"" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.

The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short ""making of"" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, ""V for Vendetta"" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.",1195776000,,3322,4.978378378378379
7763369,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a story you've probably read before.  It's the Count of Monte Cristo meets 1984; and it's beautifully done.  I think a few other reviewers tried to over analyze it.  Yes, it IS probably saying that fascism is bad and that we must jealously guard our rights or suffer having them stolen from us.  It IS saying that it's not right to marginalize and criminalize people because they don't fit exactly into the ""perfect citizen"" mold.  Wouldn't any great piece of literature do the same?

Sounds like the here and now to me and not the future.",1195084800,,614,5.029411764705882
7763371,4,B01GJQM5JM,"As an initial comment, I have not yet read the original graphic novel, although I would like to when I get the chance, but I have read another of Moore's dystopic creations (also soon to be a movie) ""The Watchmen.""  At any rate, my appraisal of the movie is not based on any evaluation of the accuracy (or apparent lack thereof) by the movie in creating a film replicate of the graphic novel.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure why a film MUST adhere to the source material.  Such criticism is only worth advancing if the film's deviation fails on its own merit, which many here believe, while I do not.

This is the only review I've ever spent much time on, if I even have other reviews, and I only bothered because it seemed like most other reviews were one-sided (pick one side or the other).  Either people saw this movie as ""telling it like it is"" and sticking it to the neocon fascists in the Bush administration (whom I firmly believe possess either a profound disdain for the rule of law, or, a disturbingly cynical view of what ""the law"" is, but whom I do not believe are personally evil people with per se malicious intent), or, people saw this as the wet dream of rabid and radical liberals frustrated with their inability to really advance an alternative vision or to successfully promote their view of what American values are.  I do not think this movie fits either description.

I like this film, not because I am some blind Bush-hating, liberal (or fill in whichever other stereotype you wish, as I've seen too many in the preceding reviews to cover them all).  I like it because I think the CORE message, at least the one that resonated with me, was depiction of the natural and easy tendency within free societies, to cede liberties and adherence to the rule of law, rather than the rule of men, in order to obtain greater security, when those societies have long enough enjoyed their liberties as to have either, forgotten what life is like in a society which has made such an exchange, or, the society has enjoyed the benefits of liberty and the rule of law so long that is less appreciative  of both its benefits and its demerits (i.e., diminished physical security).  I like how the film manages to show that when the people cede power entirely to the government, by giving up the principle that the law governs, not men, and giving up the liberties which maintain that power, the security achieved is short-lived, and the people soon find themselves facing a different fear and threat to their security from those to whom to they ceded power.

Perhaps this is a movie only someone like me can love while still being aware of these flaws and contradictions; someone who believes that the only thing that keeps our society from descending into cruelty, tyranny, barbarism, and disorder, is a strict adherence to the principle  expressed in the maxim popularized by Lord Mansfield in the Somersett case: ""Fiat justitia ruat caelum"" (roughly, ""Let justice be done, though the heavens fall."").  I love it, not in ignorance of its not-too subtle, and inartful jabs at contemporary society and politics, but in spite of its bludgeon to the head on those points, and in spite of its failure to address its own glaring inconsistencies.  I care more about that over-arching theme, I suppose, than the particular elemental details which bother me, as well as most of those who categorically dislike the movie.

I am rather young (@25) and perhaps my political views are merely developing, but I neither consider myself liberal, moderate, nor conservative.  I find myself uncomfortable occupying any perspective for too long, or at least, occupying any entirely.  For me, the appeal of this movie is its points on the importance of why the law, and not men (or humans for those who insist on PC language over John Marshall's), must govern.  Yes, the movie definitely takes aim at the current U.S. social and government situation.  There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  Criticism, especially of the government and our own society is not only at the origin of this nation, but that upon which its vitality depends.  As a third-year law student, looking at entering the legal profession, these themes resonated strongly with me, though I can see why they might resonate less strongly with those for whom a passion for the rule of law ranks below what they might themselves call ""practicality"" or ""realism"".  But again, that's what I like about the movie, even if it is so blunt as to be insulting about it (I'm cynical enough to think that blunt may often be necessary for clarity): that fascism and tyranny always begin from a point of ""realism"" and ""pragmatism"".  The law exists in order to temper passions, and temper the reason of the day, with the longstanding wisdom of forethought and basic rules by which a society and government decide they will conduct themselves.  The movie definitely hit my passions there, and that's why I love it.  I think it quite dramatically displays why the law must rule, and why, whenever one begins to think there is good reason or some exigency which justifies abrogating this basic principle of ordered civilization, that such thought must be rejected.

However, my reason for liking the movie also leads to the list of things I found troubling in this this movie, many already mentioned:

-V's own inconsistent stance on the use of violence and terror as just means by virtue of the justiciable quality of the ends to which they are employed (from the view of the one employing those ends).  I think the directors failed to explore the fine line and the biased nature of the distinctions between ""criminals"" or ""terrorists"" or ""murderers"" or what-have-you, and ""revolutionaries"" or ""freedom fighters"".  We clearly think that some who violently rebel and engage in violent resistance against a government are praiseworthy, while we think others that are, at least facially similar, are quite the opposite.  Why this is so, and the legitimacy, if any, of our distinctions is not really explored or challenged.  V is accepted as a ""revolutionary"" and the government as ""tyrannical""...These labels are presupposed, and one either accepts or rejects them, but there is no exploration of why they are so.  I thus find myself disturbed by the ferocity of V's violence against individuals who are merely pawns of the tyranny he opposes, and his casual justification of why it is just that he decide what is right and wrong, while it is unjust that the current government do the same.  The validity of these distinctions would be far more interesting, and isn't explored.  Thus, for me, V for Vendetta is loveable because it gives due credit to the importance of the principle of the ""rule of law,"" but disturbs me, and appears to suffer for undercutting this principle at the same time, by failing to distinguish the ""hero"" and his ideals, methods, and justifications, from those of the ""villains.""

-the stylized violence typical of movies these days is all the more out of place in a movie that purports to tell a story of ""heroes"" who value human life and liberty more than do the villains;

-while I'm not sure what sort of ending I would have liked, I do not think the blowing up of Parliament suits a story that does not have the original source's more anarchic endgame in mind.  I thought the ending was appropriate and stirring up to that point: the marching by the unarmed civilians against the army, that passive non-violent resistance, I thought, better resonated with the themes I loved about the movie which I thought were also its best qualities.  The destruction of the building was a distraction from the real triumph: that the people, unarmed, and in the face of threats to their lives, nevertheless, boldly marched forth to reclaim their liberty and their rule, by law, rather than by the will or whim of men (be they many or few).  THAT was the climax of the movie for me, and I wish THAT had been built upon more, rather than the FX extravaganza and ""WOW"" or ""Cool, dude..."" effect of blowing up Parliament.

So, in sum, I found much to love in this movie, but what I loved, also leads me to wish the directors had been as introspective as they demand their audience to be, and addressed these more significant conflicts in character and socio-political philosophy, rather than simplistically defining the good and evil characters for us.

I very much appreciated the way in which the ""rule of law"" as a principle is celebrated, and the dangers of the rule by human will or whim of the day are demonstrated, but thought the directors ignored the obvious fact that the hero himself, as a vigilante, necessarily engages in this same moral failure.  They obviously are aware of the conflict, as demonstrated by the several instances in which Natalie Portman's character questions, or condemns V for his tactics, but they do not really satisfy me (or many others it seems) with their explanations.

Again, perhaps this is only a film only a person passionate about the law, and who has an occasional tendency to become unreasonably idealistic at times about his passions and ideals, can enjoy at those times, while realizing that the movie only matches those ideals in its broad themes, but utterly fails them in the details when examining the characters.",1194652800,3,9314,4.787765293383271

7763373,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.

V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.

Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.

The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.

The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.

Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.

Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.

In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.",1194393600,,8731,4.578644501278772
7763374,3,B01GJQM5JM,"WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!

I should start by admitting outright that I did enjoy many parts of the V for Vendetta movie (primarily those that remained truest to the source material), and by stating my agreement with other reviewers familiar with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/graphic-novel/dp/0930289528/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">graphic novel</a>&nbsp;on which it was based that it is the best film adaptation of an Alan Moore work to date. In fact, had I never heard of the book, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more than I did (and I did appreciate it much more when I watched it for the second time on this DVD set). I am always impressed when any mainstream, major Hollywood studio produces something that encourages audiences to question authority, even when that message gets muddled by science fiction trappings, convoluted plots, and special effects. However, having read V for Vendetta several times, while I am willing to overlook some of the cinematic alterations made by the Wachowski brothers (creators of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>) as fairly harmless and perhaps even justifiable, there are two points in particular where I believe the film version totally undermines both the literary and political brilliance of the original story.

The first point pertains to the portrayal of two of the story's central characters. By demonizing High Chancellor Adam Sutler, who came across as an almost laughable caricature of a raving, frothing-at-the-mouth tyrant, the movie completely robs the story of the psychological complexity found in the book. There, the party leader, Adam Susan, is motivated by an absolute devotion to his country, and an unfaltering conviction that fascism is the only way to save it from destruction. He sacrifices his own freedoms to serve his people (at least the white, straight, Christians among them) and is willing to tolerate dissenters like Inspector Finch as long as they continue to serve the needs of the State (something I could not imagine the hysterical egomaniac played by William Hurt doing). The villains are further vilified by the insertion of a cumbersome and confusing conspiracy plot into the story.

SPOILER ALERT!

It is eventually revealed that the ruling party orchestrated the nationwide plague that precipitated its rise to power years earlier. It was as if the Wachowskis were afraid their fascist state wouldn't be frightening enough to audiences if it was only responsible for killing civil liberties, so they had to pin the mass murder of 100,000 people on it as well. This changes the party leader from someone--right wing nut job though he may be--who heeds the call of his country in its time of need to pull it from the brink of the abyss, into someone who is motivated solely by the desire for power and a narcissistic need to have the world shaped in his image. This further casts the movie's High Chancellor as the most clichd type of cartoonish supervillain. (It also further distances the story from reality and the kind of actual evil usually encountered in the world. Hitler did not have to orchestrate the economic collapse of pre-WWII Germany; he only had to exploit it.)

And while the Wachowskis chose to demonize their movie's version of Moore's High Chancellor, they also decided to subtly humanize V. It seems as though they were trying to skew the character to play as more of a hero with audiences by making such changes from the book as narrowing the focus of V's vengeance to the party elite and those who personally wronged him, inventing a conscientious objection to killing their cronies (except when necessary), and having him anguish over his treatment of Evey and breaking down in sobs when she leaves him. Although less offensive to my intelligence than the over the top evil of Adam Sutler, this softening of the book's much more menacing and Machiavellian V nonetheless detracts from the brilliance and uniqueness of Alan Moore's story. The struggle between an all too human villain and a monstrous hero is much more thought-provoking than the black and white morality presented by the movie, which alleviates the audience from any need to question the rightness of V's tactics or feel pity for any of his victims. It is a credit to Alan Moore's writing that readers can still identify with and even like V despite some of his heinous behavior in the book--

MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!

most notably his torture of Evey, which somehow came across as much more brutal when presented by artist David Lloyd in the graphic novel.

Secondly, however disappointed I was with the film adaptation's simplistic depiction of good and evil, what was even more tragic was its total failure to accurately convey the political ideology of its title character. I was horrified when the Old Bailey was blown up in the first 10 minutes of the film, and not just because V had inexplicably forgotten--despite his urging for us all to remember--that the target of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot had been Parliament. Even worse, I realized in that terrible moment that one of my two favorite scenes in the book had just been mercilessly obliterated. V's feigned conversation on the roof of the Old Bailey, in which he explains his reasons behind abandoning Justice for Anarchy, is one of the greatest monologues in graphic literature (despite some of the misogynistic terminology V employs) and makes it clear that V's goals are just as lofty as Adam Susan's (regardless of how one might feel about how either character goes about achieving them). Likewise my other favorite scene, V's address to the British nation via the State's own pirated airwaves, was transformed from a stinging indictment of political apathy and rousing appeal for personal responsibility, into an invocation of some unspecified type of democracy every bit as vague and uninspiring as any real presidential address. The choice presented to the audience of the film seems to be one between democracy and totalitarianism, which for most moviegoers means nothing more than preserving the status quo. In the book, which I consider the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism ever written (in comics or anywhere else), V presents readers with ""another way"" that offers ""new life [and] hope reinstated."" In other words, V is offering society as a whole the same sort of transformation Evey underwent (in the book, not the movie), which is nothing less than a complete&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/paradigm-shift/dp/1568382081/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">paradigm shift</a>.

The final scene of the movie reminded my wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-Of-Anarchy/dp/143253811X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Mask Of Anarchy""</a>, except without the sense of exhilaration. It's a shame the movie, unlike the book on which it was based, ultimately failed to evoke the same spirit as the closing lines of this poem:

'And these words shall then become
Like Oppression's thundered doom
Ringing through each heart and brain,
Heard again - again - again -

'Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number -
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you -
Ye are many - they are few.'",1194307200,3,7494,5.36936170212766

After seeing it again I realized how central it is to the deep meaning of the movie, how there are things more important than an individual life, that there are still ideals worth dying and maybe killing for.  Also there is freedom in refusing to surrender your ideals and ultimate freedom when you have nothing left to loose.

This is a very important film, it should rank with the best films of all time.  It's an intelligent film that may go over many people's heads if they're just looking for an action flick.  It rewards the thinking viewer.

What is frightening and relevant is that we seem to be getting close to the type of dictatorial government portrayed in this movie.

Vanquish that fear by action through words.  Words have power behind them because they have feeling, have something that is in a sense unexplainable.  Words can have a piece of us and the best parts of us if we let them flow from our hearts.

7763381,5,B01GJQM5JM,"At its most basic level I thoroughly enjoyed the move V for Vendetta simply for its swashbuckling style, its lyricism, visual effects, great action sequences, its music (especially the stones song ""street fighting man"" at the trailer)! and I enjoyed V's use of poetry to convey his eternal idea"" of justice (an idea which cannot be destroyed) behind the Guy Fawkes mask.

Some people might see the movie as violent but they miss the point that these scenes in the movie can be overlooked when you see that they could stand for metaphors relating to the disintegration of those twisted and psychotic govermental/media institutions that had brought about London's Orwellian futuristic totalitarian regime.

I think that there will always be some violence in movies such as this  but in the movie 'V for Vendetta' I think  that it was more about the power of ideas to change things much moreso then the 'power' of violence.  In my view the movie had far more meaningfulness then meaninglessness.

I could not believe how relevant this movie is - how accurately this movie describes not only where our society is headed, but where it already is.

It's a lot of fun to watch too - great acting, great action, great dialog and so many characters who draw you into the story.

7763384,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This modern day classic speaks very clearly and powerfully to the advent of fascism in the western world and manages to be very entertaining to boot! 'V' is all about how a psychopathic regime has taken over in England's near future and how the main characters, those who aren't ""in control"", have all been personally affected and/or deeply wounded, or even killed outright by this regime.

The Guy Fawkes-inspired hero/anti-hero, V; one part Zorro, one part Batman, and one part George Galloway(-; has himself been a victim of the pathocratic government. Since choosing to transmute the pain caused by his oppressors, he makes it his mission to bring awareness of an alternative to totalitarian governance to the public.

Along the way, V meets Evey, a young woman with a history of her own. In one of the most potent and emotionally stirring scenes of any movie I think I have seen in a long while, V compels Evey to face her own fear and victimization by the regime. 'V for Vendetta' is therefore just as much a story about Evey's re-birth as it is about V's Vendetta and how he carries it through.

The film makes reference to world events that appear to be happening! This makes 'V for Vendetta' a very relevant and timely film. It was interesting to notice that the mainstream reviewers who spoke negatively about the movie at the time of it's release sounded so much like the pundit who is the government's propaganda mouthpiece in the movie!

Anyway, 'V for Vendetta' should be put up there on a list with other great films of a political nature: 1984, 'Z' by Costas Gravas, The Manchurian Candidate, and The Parallax View, to name a few. It is an excellent and informative movie that, like those just mentioned, will be remembered.",1194134400,4,1740,4.732673267326732

V for Vendetta is at the top of the list! This futuristic flick is far from Science Fiction, it is our reality presently in a nut shell!
Having added this movie to our personal collection we watch it as much as twice a month and as a commemoration to the 5th of November we are having another showing.
Our teenagers have memorized this movie and can tell you word for word the dialogue V shares and the wisdom he espouses.
I recommend this flick to anyone interested in enlightening themselves on the current state of tyrannical governments around the globe. V displays the power and courage that is needed by each individual to stand up and call these governments precisely  what they are Psychopathic.
If we as humanity do not stand up and share what we all seeing happening around us we too will be the prisoners of some torture chamber in some countless location around the world.
Will you choose to watch V and take a glimpse of what might be around the corner for your town or community? Put on your Guy Fawke's mask and make a statement for truth.",1194134400,4,1309,4.546610169491525
7763386,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Some time ago, I watched ""V for Vendetta"" soon after it came out on DVD.  At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable.  This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the ""Matrix"" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality.  If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations.  While both ""Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" presented the theme of control, ""V for Vendetta"" is the best presented as a government's control of the people.  This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings.  The common people portrayed in this film did not see how controlled they are until the up-lifting appearance of a character named ""V.""

In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie.",1194048000,6,962,4.829268292682927

It wasn't the super hero type movie that I thought it might end up, considering what Hollywood does to movies from novels. They actually did a pretty good job not detracting from the real message within the movie.

I perhaps expected a bit of the dark undertones as in the cinematography of the movie 1984, but this was completely opposite. It was crisp, the music was enthralling and demanding. It moved fluidly, the cinematography was excellent, and I loved the soundtrack. The actors themselves are perfect for the role - you actually start believing they are who they portray. I thought it a nice touch to see John Hurt in the role of Chancellor - especially since he was Winston in 1984.",1194048000,13,849,4.5855263157894735
7763395,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I'll never forget seeing this movie for the first time on the big screen. Being a big fan of the Matrix films, I was eagerly anticipating the Wachowskis' next project. And for the next 130 minutes, I was blown away. Not only was the story intricate and engaging, the acting intense and convincing, the characters sympathetic and human, but the subtext of the film was unbelievable.

At several points throughout the film my jaw dropped and I thought, ""Did they just say what I thought they said?"" I walked out of the theater elated and awed at what the filmmakers had created. I even had a moment of delusional optimism: ""Maybe people will GET it! This could be the movie that breaks the door down!"" But, like a sign from the great pessimist in the sky, my wishful thinking was promptly rebuked.

Leaving the theater I overheard a man talking with his son. They, too, had just seen the movie. Surely, he had seen what I had seen; heard what I had heard. But no. ""It was a good movie,"" he said. ""But just remember, son, it's a movie, not real life."" I wanted to sock the guy in the face. How could a human see the movie and come away with such a pusillanimous and lily-livered response?

What property of human stubbornness and ""thick-skulledness"" can misinterpret the line, ""artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up."" But I should know better. The human mind has a hyperactive and tenacious tendency to avoid uncomfortable conclusions.  Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme. If believing two contradictory pieces of information at the same time can prevent one from accepting an uncomfortable truth, our subconscious is more than willing to give us a hand.

""No son, our government would never do such a thing."" Bollocks.

V for Vendetta is a no-holds-barred condemnation of the creeping fascism that has infected both the American and British systems of government; of their repeated use of false-flag operations to cow their populations into blind and terror-based submission; the presence of psychopathic individuals in said governments and all the implications that follow from that point.",1194048000,16,2136,4.870523415977962
7763396,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The fact is that no matter what you might think of this adaptation of the graphic novel or the methods used by V to achieve his ends, what it tells us about ourselves and where we are currently heading makes it an absolutely worthwhile movie to watch.

The film takes place in a dystopian future that is very nearly the present for much of what is still known as the ""free world."" Wars and disease had shocked people into submission (see Naomi Klien's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shock-Doctrine-The-Rise-of-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0805079831/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism</a>&nbsp;for more on that) and a power hungry dictator filled the gap in their minds with mock security and peace. It doesn't deal with the fall into totalitarianism itself, but then we've had ample opportunity to watch that happen across Europe already with the spread of fascism in the 20th century as brilliantly detailed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Political-Ponerology-A-Science-on-the-Nature-of-Evil-Adjusted-for-Political-Purposes/dp/1897244258/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)</a>.

As V puts it in the film:

""Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.""

That dystopian future is our immediate future. WATCH THIS MOVIE. Open your eyes and decide if this is the future you really want for yourself. Stop giving your silent, obedient consent to suppression of your humanity.",1194048000,7,2680,5.626237623762377

I still can't name that feeling it produced in me and it was the best i got out of this movie. I don't even know how to describe it: like when you are scared and crouched on a dark cold corner and this feeling comes to straighten you up and shine warmth through you as you stand your height.

It definitely makes you want to go out there and Do something about the world situation that is unfolding before our eyes, just like is depicted in this movie: surveillance, the creation of an enemy and virus outbreaks by the government in order to control the populace through fear, the manipulation of truth, and the sleepiness of the masses... then V comes!

One scene that really stood out for me: When the inspector asks V (from memory) ""Why did it take you so long?"" and V replies, ""I was waiting for you"". A man with conscience to come along, who will be able to See the situation objectively. A sleeping person who is willing to awake for the sake of truth.

7763402,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is just a Must See movie, as it has a powerful message apt for the times in which we are living. Though V himself is taking personal revenge in the way of killing the leaders in control, his appeal to people is not one of violence. He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime. That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.

The scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non-violence and civil disobedience.

As this non-violent uprising culminates in the film on the 5th of November, it is a timely reminder to go out and buy this video and let the message sink in.

As a follow up reading ""1984"" by George Orwell, is eerily close in describing the fascist society that is shown in the film and sadly also close to the way things are going. The book ""Political Ponerology"" is another recommendable book that details the process by which a society gets to become a totalitarian state.",1193961600,3,1206,4.423423423423423

And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting submission."" That's not what happens with the fictional Britain in the movie. It's happening in the U.S. with the Patriot Act and the like.

More than just pointing out the objective reality, the movie will give you a sense of hope. It is really moving to see thousands of people in their V masks marching in unison. It's a powerful force that once released, no government can contain.

This movie shows the psychopathic people who are in control of a country and how they are abusing their power, as all psychopaths do.  And although I am not endorsing the way that the revenge of ""V"" was handled, there is a sense of encouragement that one has while watching the movie.

I think that ""V for Vendetta"" is a very important movie in its own right.  It brings to light the true face behind the mask of those who are in power right now in real life.  It is a movie that needs to be seen by those who think that their governments have their best interests at heart.  To show them that 'Big Brother' is already here.",1193875200,4,980,4.208556149732621

7763408,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The year is 2020 and the people of Great  Britain are blind. It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.

Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's ""1984"".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.

Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.

He calls himself ""V.""

V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.

The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.

Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but ""V"" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.

As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.

Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.  There is enough content to make ""V"" worth watching again--and showing to my friends.",1192665600,7,2426,4.707838479809976

7763411,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I am proud to say I have now read the comic and seen this great movie. Other than taking a little artistic license to make the more relevant to today's audience, the writing and direction stayed true to the comic book as far as I'm concerned. Many reviewers have commented that it is a rip off of 1984, but those people should be blaming Alan Moore for that since he wrote the comic, not the Wachowski brothers. While Mr. Moore may not have been happy with the movie, most artistic people are not happy with other people (with different ideas about what their work means) ""messing"" with it. I love the fact that thousands of people can see, read, or hear something and have completely different ideas about what it means. While it has been a couple of years since I read the comic, I thought that the movie illustrated the point of the comic book very well. To me I found the main point to be that people can make a difference if they just stand up. I plan on buying it from Amazon so I can watch it again and again as many times as I want.

Instead we get one of the lamest screenwriting jobs I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.  I kept watching telling myself, ""The dialogue will get better, the plot will become less predictable, it will get better, just give it another 20 minutes.....  ok, another 20 minutes...... ok, just 10 more minutes....""

Sadly, I didn't listen to myself and instead continued watching - hoping and praying the movie would get better.  The acting was fine - they just didn't have anything to work with.  The story is the biggest ripoff ever of the much, much better Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.

As far as style, I can't dog this movie at all - it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent.  Just a shame they failed to include even a half-decent screenwriter in that budget!",1190419200,65,928,4.720496894409938

Because, I love this movie that's why!!!  Great plot that is easy to follow.  Great photography.  This film looks great.  Great supporting cast from the lead detective, the news anchors, the chancelor and all the rest.  Wonderful.  Then there's Natalie Portman.  She could easily have become an over the top super heroine, but instead maintained her status as one of the common folk dealing with circumstances.  She was terrific. Finally, when it comes to acting, Hugo Weaving who wears a mask through the whole film delivers a complex character, making him human, caring and frightening at the same time.  He does it without the benefit of facial expressions, although through his body language you can imagine his expressions.  Now there is an excellent piece of work.  All of these fine performances are done in what is almost a comic book movie.  V is a hero for the masses, almost a Batman against the establishment.  I've seen this movie several times and have enjoyed it every time.  This one goes beyond the action film.  This one gives characters with depth.  It does have a lot of violence in it and some of the fight scenes are of the Aeon Flux or Ultraviolet or Matrix variety, but still above average.  This one is easy to recommend to others.",1189814400,4,1396,4.6016260162601625

7763417,5,B01GJQM5JM,"A nation with a long history of democracy succumbs to a totalitarian regime, whose stranglehold upon the population is based upon the spread of fear of fictional disorder & terrorism.  Such is the plot of the sci-fi/fantasy/drama entitled ""V for Vendetta"" from 2005 that is very apropos for today's world.  The film's main character, known only as ""V"" (played by Hugo Weaving), remains hidden behind a mask for the duration of the film, which takes place in a future United Kingdom ruled by an iron-fisted chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  With symbols reminiscent of Nazism and similarities with George Orwell's novel ""1984"", Sutler has imposed a curfew upon the entire country and has banned anything (books, art, films, etc.) that he has deemed inappropriate; but in V's secret home, V has rescued many works in the hopes that one day, democracy and freedom can be restored.  On a dark November night, V shakes the totalitarian establishment by blowing up a building in the heart of London and goes after specific individuals whom he kills and leaves a trademark rose behind.  A young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), is caught outside after curfew by government agents, but is rescued by V, who happens to be out.  With her assistance, V gains entrance to a TV station in London and broadcasts an appeal to the nation to join with him one year from that night to witness the destruction of Parliament, but will a nation's population that has been beaten down by an overbearing government and living in fear break their bonds?  Only by watching this film will you find out, as well as the terrible means by which Sutler gained absolute power.

Based upon a graphic novel of the same name by artist David Lloyd, ""V for Vendetta"" is a compelling film whose actors were very interesting and engaging.  Though the film received no Oscar nominations, Natalie Portman won a Saturn Award for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.  The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Costume, Best Science Fiction Film and Best Writing (Larry and Andy Wachowski).  This was also James McTeigue's first film that he was director, though he has much previous experience as a second unit or assistant director for films such as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003), ""Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" (2002), ""The Matrix"" (1999) and ""Dark City"" (1998).  His future directing endeavors will hopefully turn out to be as good, if not better, than ""V for Vendetta"".

Overall, the 2005 film ""V for Vendetta"" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to every sci-fi/fantasy film aficionado.",1186790400,2,2646,4.89261744966443

In fact, the comic series was what kept me away from the movie from so long! I just did finally watch the movie the other day though and was very pleased. It presented the story in a much clearer and cohesive fashion. Usually, hollywood does nothing but screw things up but once in a while, although it's VERY rare, they improve on a comic. This is one of those times. No, moore's unhappy with it. Moore's unhappy with so many things, I have to say ""get over yourself, Alan"". they did a better job telling the story than you did.

7763423,1,B01GJQM5JM,"When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be a thought provoking film, artsy, and action-packed.

Instead, it turned out to be over-the-top, utterly predictable, and seemed to drag on. My boyfriend put it perfectly as ""excrutiatingly painful"".

The hero was annoyingly over-dramatic. I wanted to smack some sense into the heroine/love-interest. And many other characters had us hollering, ""What the heck did you expect?!?""

The political statements, though obscenely transparent, didn't bother me as much the rest of the story-lines.

The film had potential (which is why the minimum 1 star rating isn't bothering as much as it could). It fell severely short of what it could have been.

I'm glad I waited for it to go down in price before I bought the DVD (and didn't see it in theaters). I don't think I would have paid more than $2 for it if I had known how it turned out to be. Unfortunately, I paid quite a bit more than that... and ended up wasting a couple hours of my life in the process. (Can I have that time back, please???)",1184544000,6,1052,4.60427807486631
7763424,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I had been told about V for Vendetta by friends who had seen it and  said that it was an absolutely amazing movie. It took me awhile to get around to watching this film, but  when I finally saw it on DVD I was quite stunned. How on earth did it ever get made? How did it get past the censors? For V for Vendetta is like an anarchist manifesto! I know it was loosely based on a controversial English graphic novel; and that its creators didn't like this film version much at all, although I don't really know why. The Wachowski's should be congratulated for bringing this timely film to the silver screen as I think it is most relevant in todays climate of increasing religious fundamentalism, extremism and intolerance. The film is set in a bleakly dystopian UK of the near future whose populace lives in constant fear of the oppressive Christo-Fascist dictatorship called Norsefire (based on the National Front) run by a demented Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) who though reclusive, rules with an iron fist. The regime deports so called foreigners, black bags intellectuals, artists, sexual minorities and anyone who presumably steps out of line. The story of the film follows one Evey Hammond (Natalie  Portman) who is out late one night and is accosted by some secret policemen called ""fingermen"" who intend to rape her. She is saved at the last moment by a mysterious masked vigilante named V (Hugo Weaving) who takes her to his lair... but only after blowing up the Old Bailey first!

V is the tortured and obsessive antihero of the film that over time opens up Evey's mind to the horrors that are going on around her unquestioned and unchallenged by anyone, and this is where the story really begins. V has a personal grudge against the Norsefire regime and he is the only one brave enough to stand up to them; and certainly does so with great panache, style and flair! V is a freedom fighter, and not a terrorist like some have claimed, for he is primarily fighting for the rights of the downtrodden people and not some twisted and reactionary political or religious dogma. Throughout the movie V and Evey are under investigation by the police, and it's a race against time for him to accomplish his goal of toppling the corrupt Norsefire regime. One of the chief reasons I appreciate this film is for its compassionately positive portrayal of its gay and lesbian characters; for I think that many fundamentalist leaders today (of most religious persuasions) would truly love to marginalize, persecute and vilify sexual and gender minorities in the same way that Norsefire does, though only if they got their way of course.

V for Vendetta the film may not be as good as the graphic novel, but then, film versions of books rarely are. Doubtless Hollywood has filtered out some of the more explicit political and drug references, but the anarchist message still comes across loud and clear. So if I were the author I wouldn't be too upset for sales of the original graphic novel have gone up, and most importantly, people are slowly becoming more politically aware and socially conscious. This is an important movie that openly questions where Western culture is heading; the christian right is gaining power, the separation of church and state is constantly being challenged, many of our basic democratic freedoms and civil liberties are being eroded and big business is creating a bland intellectual, cultural and ecological wasteland. So if humanity doesn't start to grow up as soon as possible, then I fear the world we live in has no future. Viva la revolution!

* On a more historical note the character of V takes his inspiration from Guy Fawkes (1570-1606) the British Catholic revolutionary who fought against religious oppression, and who attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament! =S",1184544000,,3803,4.816232771822358

At first, I wondered what it all was about, but I quickly got involved in the story!  Similar to 1984 and other ""futuristic"" scenarios where the earth or various countries have a top-to-bottom make-over, and a super hero emerges to restore the people's power and goodness!  One problem I personally have is that movies of this genre usually make the group or govt. that wants to restore order to a decadent culture gone mad, into the bad guys because they do want to restore decency.  Other than that, i.e., if you are conservative and would LIKE some decency restored, and you don't like to be portrayed as some right-wing religious nutcase for wanting this done, you will probably like this story.",1184371200,3,798,4.760869565217392

I agree with some of the posters that I could almost believe that I can see the hero's facial expressions, even through the mask. Ms. Portman proves that she is an actor and wears a shaved head beautifully.

I expected politics in a movie that I knew would focus on human rights, individual liberty and abuse of power. I appreciate the triumph of the human spirit depicted by thousands of individuals and families turning out spontaneously to oppose their oppressors, and agree with the assertion that we are truly free when we are willing to die rather than surrender our liberty. However, the movie could have made these points without the gratuitous portrayal of the ""conservative and religious"" leader who hates homosexuals as much as he loves power. All the while, the supposedly religious bad guy blames other ""religious fanatics"" for the nation's troubles while banning the Koran and free speech. The point was made very well before the heavy-handed anti-religious viewpoint was revealed time after time in the last half. As the credits roll, we hear that the answer is ""humanism.""",1183766400,3,1186,5.020304568527918

The acting was exemplary in my opinion.  Portman did a great job (as usual), but I have to tip my hat to the actor who had the task of playing the role of V.  It has to be difficult to use purely gesture and voice inflection to play a part, and he was excellent!  I could imagine the emotions hidden behind the mask.

Yes, the film could be interpreted as being somewhat ""preachy"" and portraying a transparent political and/or social agenda, but it makes one think.  It can evoke strong emotion.  To me those are things that can make a movie great.

7763437,1,B01GJQM5JM,"Anyone who believes in the right of a creator to control that which he creates should not watch this film, pure and simple.

Alan Moore, the literary genius who wrote the spectacular graphic novel on which this mediocre action picture was based stated on numerous occasions that he did not approve of this adaptation of his work, that the work essentially ""got it wrong"" and missed the point of his book, and that he did not want to be associated with the film.

Since he said it better than I can, I'll quote him below:

""[The movie] has been ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England."" (from an interview of Alan Moore on MTV, 8-30-06)

The bottom line is that the Wachowskis and Silver took one of the most complex and intelligent books about dystopia, man's interaction with the state and the easy slide from democracy to fascism and turned it into a dumb action picture and low-watt paranoid liberal rant ala Air America, and I say that as a liberal.

7763444,2,B01GJQM5JM,"Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking--though unintentionally so--is V for Vendetta, the latest installment of the Wachowski brothers's downward slide into formulaic banality. Directed by James McTeigue, the veteran first assistant director of such fare as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Matrix trilogy, V is his first directing effort in which nobody but himself can be blamed for monumental ineptness.

Upon its release, V for Vendetta sparked a lot of debate among libertarians and Objectivists about its anarchistic and nihilistic themes, and from that vantage point I was prepared to write this review. Easier said than done. After viewing nearly all four hours of this CGI special effects extravaganza (during which, inexplicably, the hands on my watch moved only two hours and twelve minutes), I scarcely found any dialogue coherent enough to be debated.

Set in the England of the future, V for Vendetta centers around its ""hero,"" V, played by Hugo Weaving. V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing ""Cry Me a River""?), who surrounds himself with now-banned books. For you see, the great Fortress has been taken over by ""Norsefire,"" a fascist theocracy. Its leader, Chancellor Adam Sutler, is a neo-conservative turned Big Brother, played by John Hurt. Just so the subtle novelty of a fuming and spitting despot who governs by Jumbotron isn't lost on the viewer, the makeup people made certain to give Hurt a shortish-cropped mustache and a slicked-back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love.

Against this repressive backdrop, V nurses a four-hundred-year-old chip on his shoulder about the hanging of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the British Parliament. V also has a laundry list of personal grudges: he survived a secret government biological warfare experiment gone awry, as well as burns over one hundred percent of his body.

All of this is meant to guarantee the viewer's sympathy for V's sociopathic killing spree as a knife-wielding assassin and mad bomber. After curfew, he prowls London's streets, avenging Norsefire's innocent victims. He hides behind a plaster Guy Fawkes mask, which appears rather stiff, though not as stiff as Weaving's acting.

V happens upon our damsel-in-distress, Evey Hammond, played by the waifish Natalie Portman, whom he rescues from a back-alley rape at the hands of the curfew police, in a deftly-choreographed, computer-generated bloodletting by stainless-steel daggers that produce the requisite ""swoosh"" and ""chunk"" sound effects. V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one-hundred-percent body burns. According to the actuarial tables, he shouldn't be moving at all; but that's a moot point.

After dispensing with the goon squad, V introduces himself to Evey by way of an alliterative soliloquy containing forty-seven words beginning with the letter ""V."" It's meant to be charming and chivalrous, but comes off more like Snidely Whiplash doing a Jesse Jackson impression. V then asks Evey to accompany him for a night on the town, whereupon he blows up that citadel of British jurisprudence, the Old Bailey. Talk about fireworks on a first date!

The next day, the government takes credit for his dynamiting job, claiming that Old Bailey was condemned as unsafe. Unfortunately, another side effect that V suffered in prison was an abiding and strident narcissism; so he takes over television broadcast studios to inform Londoners that he blew up Old Bailey, and that in one year--on the day Guy Fawkes burns in effigy--he will level Parliament. Through another subtle plot twist--Evey just happens to work as a gofer at the TV studio (surprise!)--V manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice. This sets up the tedium that follows, right up to the anticipated anticlimactic climax.

V for Vendetta doesn't just rip off George Orwell's 1984; that would imply some sort of thematic unity. Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself. When not squiring Evey about his secret lair a l The Phantom of the Opera, V hunts down the bastards responsible for his fate in pale homage to The Count of Monte Cristo, while inciting the people to take back their country in a side plot embarrassingly reminiscent of that other ""V""--the 1983 TV mini-series about invading aliens from outer space. The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too. There's even a flashback that seamlessly melds the innocence of awakening lesbian passion with lush Merchant-Ivory cinematography from the 1920s.

Amidst all the slow-mo slicing and dicing, V is fond of chiding his deserving prey that ""ideas do matter."" In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet. The film's tagline--""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""--is a rather Jeffersonian conception that rings with the spirit of limited government.

Yet for all its nods to individual liberty, V for Vendetta fetishizes freedom through its direct advocacy of anarchy. Justifying his annihilation of Parliament, V argues that ""the world doesn't need a building, it needs an idea""--patently ignoring the ideas of common law and representative democracy that very building embodies. Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom.

This is an obscenity to anyone who remembers his World War II history. From Parliament's halls, Winston Churchill rallied Britons in their ""finest hour"" to face down Hitler's Third Reich on the eve of the Battle of Britain. In their sick revision, however, the Wachowskis defeat the Nazis by leveling Parliament--never mind the fact that the Nazis burned down the Germans' Reichstag to consolidate power.

Despite V's pompously vague appeals to the power of ideas, all that viewers are left with is a lot of the moral relativity piffle that leftist professors are so fond of quoting, to the effect that ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Substitute the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for Old Bailey and Parliament, and you'll get the drift of this sickening allegory.

Or, to drive the point closer to home, substitute, in Parliament's place, Columbine High School in suburban Denver. Before the murderous rage in which Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris massacred twelve schoolmates and a teacher, they produced an amateur video glorifying their school's wanton and nihilistic destruction.

Thankfully, they took their own sorry lives immediately thereafter. Imagine what cinematic epics Klebold and Harris might have scripted from their prison cells. Their insane musings wouldn't have looked much different from this nauseating waste of celluloid.",1179619200,9,6938,5.22751798561151

Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.  Yet as a film, this one is missing some things.  I never truely contected with V.  There are a few scene when he comes off looking rather silly (cooking-kissing).  Weaving, likely a strong actor with a very theatrical voice, the mask was too cold a shield for an audience to connect to.  At the very least I would have liked to see his eyes.

7763452,3,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a pleasant, provocative movie that is either an insult or satyre,  that I  have not discovered, or a manifestation of the collective aspirations of british fascism... as I learned by reading other reviewers, this movie comes from a graphic novel, so it does come from fertile ground for uncovering or exposing dark truths.

Ideally this review should be read by having Pink Floyd's ""Waiting for the worms""  (from The Wall) as background and melody that repeats at certain intervals.

""Would you like to see Britannia
Rule again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.

Would you like to send our colored cousins
Home again, my friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms.""

So we are in Britannia some 30 years from present day. Unlike 1984, the dystopia state ruled by a fascist dictator (ironically played by John Hurt, which we all remember as Winston Smith in 1984 a movie censored nowdays) except that we are in a prosperous setting. If you look closely, this is not the multi-cultural London we know, if fact, this is a state where traditional anglo saxon virtues have been restored, it is George Bush's and all the neo conservatives dream land. What happened to the US? To me it was unclear, though a reviewer says that a brief hint in the movies makes it seem like it was destroyed in a civil war.

Britannia is at this state in peace, the terrorist attacks of the past and the ""dark years that followed"" where unexplained purges took place, foreigners, islamics, homosexuals, dissenters were ""relocated"", disappeared or subjected to a series  of nazi like  human experiments where our mask hero seems to have acquired his feline, supernatural talents.

Just for this setting, the movie should inspire us to reflect about the manipulative campaign of fear that today the USA and other powers are resorting to flirting with totalitarian ""selective"" methods. It is the Hobbean ruler that takes over the mind of the collective, which infinitely prefers totalitarism over anarchy. Even though the movie fails to create a coherent message of the rise of the new British fascism (apparently the only good thing that came out of this was the suppression of that bloody monarchy and all the pomp and circumstance that comes with it)  it does a good job at hinting, and showing us how over with time, homosexuals were persecuted, and islamophobic culture was instated, etc. (the racial cleansing or departures was apparently taboo even in this kind of setting, well, it is still Hollywood produced).

But wait, our hero while using an English complot inspiration (some fellow who tried to blow up the parliament in the 17th century) is really a republican, Jeffersonian inspired... by being able to take over the only tv station in Britannia, he manages to wake up the conscience of the dormant herds that now yawn at their complacency in totalitarism, by inviting them for a sort of ""peaceful and collective"" resistance to the regime.

When the bull smells, it smells, and the brits recognize the bull that the regime says right away, our hero is able to carry out his Count-of-Montecristo revenge against those who wronged him revelaing the putrid state of religion high rankers, scientist, etc. He picks up a girl (Portman) and teaches her how to face her fears until true courage emerges from the depths of despair.. in here there is a message to the young that is very appealing and I guess why the movie is so popular for the young (Note- if you are young and do not understand this review, read some books and get the facts before you start spewing out offensive comments, valid if you are old too).

The message of hope spreads like wildfire and the promise to start a new order is achieved in a way that is rather weak to me, for the blowing of the parliament seems more like a terrorist dream than a protest that the true power resides in the people... the problems that the revolting brits do not seem to have much republican enthusiasm.

So if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want  some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea.",1178841600,,4108,4.73109243697479
7763453,1,B01GJQM5JM,"Oh jeez, how to begin to describe this pile of rubbish?

Natalie Portman, as usual, manages to shine through the ridiculous premise of this movie, the illogical plotlines, and the hideously pious preaching of the current politically correct thinking of Hollywood.

Hugo Weaving?  Does anybody even have proof that he was in this movie?  How do we know that it wasn't just David Prowse, or some other Darth Vader wannabe stiff taken off the actors' unemployment lines that was behind that Guy Fawkes mask?

Hugo Weaving ACTING?  Give me a break.  His most outstanding acting abilities in previous movies have all been in his facial features, stern, menacing, and yet capable of compassion.

Weaving's face is NEVER seen in this movie.  If that was him, what a waste of money and talent.  Waving your arms around, pointing your fingers here and there, and flinging knives, all the while wearing a mask, do not count as acting in my book - just about any high school level actor could have done this job.

And as for all of this business about Britain being taken over by an evil conservative government with some sort of a pseudo-right wing Christian religious bent (which uses a double-cross symbol that somewhat resembles an Eastern Orthodox cross), come on, this is all Hollywood again.  Britain and Europe are now suffering from a severe DECLINE in religious beliefs everywhere except in the immigrant Muslim communities.  If there is a religion that is threatening the future well-being of Europeans, it is certainly not Christianity.  The Wachowski brothers are just doing the usual bigoted Christian bashing that has become so de rigueuer for Hollywood movies.

Alan Moore, one of the creators of the original comic series on which this movie was based, had this to say about the movie:

""[The movie] has been ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.""

I have to say, in reading about the original comic book version of V for Vendetta, that Moore's own vision was also terribly near-sighted.  The comic book was riding the 1980's era liberal British themes of anti-Thatcherism and anti-Reaganism, as well as fear of a nuclear war that would destroy Britain as the result of Reagan basing American nuclear missiles in Europe.

None of those fears came to pass.  Britain was revitalized by Thatcher's socialism-busting policies and became an economically freer and far more vigorous nation.  The threat posed by the American nuclear missiles in Europe led to a landmark nuclear disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union.  Then the U.S.S.R. collapsed, as did the threat of Europe getting caught in an all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  And in Britain, Thatcher's Conservative Party did eventually get replaced by Blair's Labor Party, but the Labor Party had to transform itself from a shrill advocate of the restrictive protections of socialism in order to get back into power, and it has never been the same again.

Entirely different forces now threaten Britain and Europe, and they are not the ones depicted in this very, very vapid movie.

7763454,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Insulting to a viewer's intelligence, I mean.

At a few times throughout this movie, I just had to roll my eyes and wonder if it was really necessary to hit us over the head with the metaphorical sledgehammer.  Yes, I see the references to 1984, Hitler, and all the rest.  Yes, I see the cracks at Bush,etc, etc, etc.  However, despite the occasional (somewhat self-satisfied) sigh, I did enjoy the Shakespeare quotes, the camera work, and the film itself.

What did rankle a bit, though is that at the end, I was not cheering for V as much as I felt the film should have made me.  Despite their attempts to use what happened to him to forgive everything and anything, I agree with Evey that they created a monster.  Or, maybe, I just didn't want anything as gorgeous as the Parliament building in London to be blown up.  I hear that the original graphic novel kept the ambiguity of the characters.  That would have been good.  As is, I can't help but sympathize with V, though I can't condone his actions, either.",1177286400,2,1014,4.491803278688525
7763455,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I haven't read the graphic novel. I expect this lends a great deal to why, for me, this movie was bloody soul-striking.

I am a revolutionary, not an anarchist. Given the choice between statism and anarchy, I would take anarchy in a heartbeat. ""V for Vendetta"" is the tale of one man's vengeance with the ultimate aim to liberate a nation, and the existential journey of the woman who is forced to take his side. They are V and Evey.

Incorrectly marketed as an action movie, this is more a drama and an obvious political commentary on the state of the world. To me, the most important aspect of this story is the journey of Evey, who begins the movie living a life of fear. Her journey begins with a flight out of terror, until she is forced the face her fear, and, eventually, her death.

When at last she is given death, the growing parallels throughout the movie combine, until the visions of V's breaking and Evey's breaking unite in fire, in water, in screams and in tears. In this moment, I knew that I loved this movie.

Others will follow what is purported as the main story until its end, marked by its own inspirational terror and beauty. The price of blood is blood, and the character V is one of flesh and blood. Knowing this, the end is apparent.

Natalie Portman is magnificent as well. She is so beautiful and a natural actress. Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit. Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.""

Natalie Portman was great (do you suppose that's where Britney got the idea to shave her head?), and Hugo Weaving really conveyed a lot of emotion, even though he wore a mask throughout the entire film. It was cool when he was listening to Getz/Gilberto The Girl From Ipanema while scrambling eggs for Natalie in his Bachelor Pad/Bunker.

I heard that the author of the graphic novel upon which it was based disowned the project, but like Bladerunner, it might have been a different story than what the author had in mind, but was a compelling cinematic vision in its own right.

Eventually a victim of the government (in this case, V) performs daring acts to get the people to think about standing up to what should be ""their"" government.

7763466,3,B01GJQM5JM,"The best things in this literate Wachowski brothers' adaptation of the classic Moore/Lloyd graphic novel are its stars, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions.

The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous ""1984"" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in ""Triumph of the Will."" The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido ""Guy"" Fawkes.",1174262400,4,2229,5.057065217391305

And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars!  So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.

7763472,3,B01GJQM5JM,"Missed this one in the theater and it finally came up in the Netflix queue. As seems to be the case with movies made from graphic novels these days, the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the visual style of the comic while not necessarily retaining the story or underlying meaning. This was even more egregious in this case, where V is portrayed as a heroic figure whose victimization justifies the means by which he extracts his revenge with the added bonus of freeing the enslaved citizens of a nation. Sorry, but I think I understand why Alan Moore chose to remove his credit from the movie: in the graphic novel, the ending is ambiguous and serves to underscore the question of whether the means ever justifies the ends. The most effective sequence is Evie's torture and subsequent ""freedom,"" but the film breaks down in the last fifteen minutes where the directors fall back on hoary blockbuster tropes with slow-motion mega-violence and big blow-'em-ups. For a movie that wants you to take it seriously as part criticism of where the U.S. and the U.K. might be headed in the name of fighting terrorism, the ending betrays any thoughtfulness for spectacle. Disappointing, to say the least. It's not the fault of any of the actors, who were uniformly wonderful, including the understated Stephen Rea as the inspector. This flub has to be laid solely on the screenwriters and directors.",1173139200,2,1395,4.841004184100418

I have not been impressed with this endless stream of regurgitated remakes this past year.  It's like Hollywood has gone brain dead.  Worse, these remakes are sooooooooo weak.  So when a movie moves me, spellbinds me, leaves me breathless, I am so thrilled to find it.  This movie has the pinch of 1984 (odd, since John Hurt was in that film, too), Zorro, Phantom of the Opera...heck, even the ""V"" is so much like the telly series V!!!  With a film striking so many ""chords"" within us, it's bound to find an audience, but is it original?  Damn straight it is!

This movie, obviously, done in the UK, gives visions of grace and beauty, of the every man wanting a voice, wanting justice, wanting to believe.  It gives you humanity; it gives you romance.  The writing is fast paced, inventive so what was old is new again.  And Hugo Weaving is THE actor for the role of V.

7763474,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is a political allegory in league with ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""1984"" although neither as compelling nor realistic as any of those films. It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.

While hardly a masterpiece, ""V for Vendetta"" is certainly better and more entertaining than ""The Island"", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.

The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.

Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.

The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's ""Bananas"" played straight, without the laughs. If you enjoyed any of the aforementioned films I'm sure you'll enjoy ""V for Vendetta"".",1173052800,10,1655,4.9
7763475,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same goverment that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independant, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!
I have to note that it's a neat coincidence that this is set in the year 2020, just like DePalma's ""Mission To Mars"". People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independant thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Micheal Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".
We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is concidered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We are quickly declining into a fascist state as long as our current president is in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definetly time to stop all of the hate crimes! Has anyone ever stopped to think that when the Twin Towers fell in NYC, they ""imploded"", like a building would do when it is being demolished and bombs are in the BOTTOM of the building, not near one of the top floors! Has anyone ever questioned why Bin Laden's family got free air flight out of the country the day of the 'terrorist' attacks??? And, why did the president feel the need to go after Sadam when it was allegedly Bin Laden that we should have went after? More questions than answers. It's because the terrorist act was committed by our very own government! And I have noticed that after they started taking God out of the USA, the USA has gone downhill like a bobsled on a THICK sheet of ice. I don't mean ""religion"", for God and religion are two seperate things all together. And, I don't mean to sound as if I'm defending any kind of religous zealots (fanatics), like our president, who is doing all of this in a very scary religous fervor, while countless people 'sleep' and declare him the best president ever. SCARY!!!

7763486,1,B01GJQM5JM,"I will put up with a lot from certain films.  I don't mind low budgets, inexperienced actors, flawed screenplays, etc., if the film has something good to offer.  That's one reason why I liked ""Bound,"" an earlier low budget offering from the Wachowski brothers.

But I won't put up with a run-your-agenda-down-your-throat film from anyone.

What's the difference between a normal film and. a run-the-agenda-down-your-throat film?  Well, for starters, the latter will feature ""good"" characters as wonderful, happy people with no character flaws whatsoever, while the ""bad"" characters will be completely corrupt and evil with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  A lot of writers have written stories as simplistic as this - when they were nine years old.

Of course, a lot of great art was created with an agenda in mind.  Steinbeck's stated purpose in writing the Grapes of Wrath was to create sympathy for the plight of the migrant farm worker.  But he created memorable, well-rounded characters and a mature storyline, and in the process created great art - none of which V for Vendetta even tries to do.

But don't take my word for it - decide for yourself.  Might this film have an anti-Christian, pro-gay agenda or no?  Let's see:

1. The evil government is a fascist Christian theocracy, with a modified cross as symbol in the color scheme (red/black) of Nazi Germany.

2. Every representative of the government is completely evil and corrupt with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever

3. This evil government locks up/kills homosexuals for walking down the street hand-in-hand

4. We are told that this Christian theocracy arose because of ""America's War,"" while we see news footage from Iraq

5. Despite this current events reference, apparently showing a desire to root the film in reality, no acknowledgement is ever made that this type of ""oppression"" and ""fascism"" isn't actually happening in democracies.  That is, neither North America nor Europe actually haul off and kill homosexuals, but current Muslim theocracies like Iran and Saudi Arabia do.

6. Despite this, a gay TV producer owns a copy of the government-outlawed Koran, which he says he likes for its ""poetry.""  Somehow its denunciations of gays and exhortations to kill them doesn't faze him

7. The same gay TV producer is taken away by jackbooted thugs for criticizing the government, and later executed for owning a copy of the Koran

8. With the possible exception of ""V,"" every protagonist is a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving character with no character flaws whatsoever.  Even Natalie Portman is so good-hearted she forgives V for imprisoning, torturing and humiliating her, falls in love with him and commits terrorism for him in the name of their ""love.""

9. We are treated to an overly long flashback of a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving lesbian character with no character flaws whatsoever who recounts how she ""just wanted to love in peace"" but was hauled off, tortured and executed by the Christian Theocracy just for being gay.

10. The head of the Christian church is an accomplice to murder and torture, is overtly corrupt, and is a pedophile.  Oddly enough, however, he is fixated on underage girls, not boys.  But why not?  After other attempts to have the film vaguely reflect reality, why not portray what is unfortunately the norm of priest pedophilia scandals, that is, man-boy?  Could it be that to portray homosexuality in any less-than-favorable light would be unacceptable?

11. Despite the worldwide concerns about terrorists and their attacks against civilians in dozens of countries worldwide, the apparent goal of the film is for the viewer to better understand why a terrorist would blow up buildings, murder innocent civilians and take down a government (?????)

No, I'm sorry, this film was one long agenda-spouting travesty from start to finish.  I really expected more from the ""Matrix"" team.  I can't even get into production design, acting, cinematography and the rest because I couldn't get past the relentless - and I do mean RELENTLESS - agenda.  So, if you want to see aggressively anti-Christian, anti-American, ham-handed pro-gay propaganda that talks down to you as if you were a three-year old, this is for you.

7763491,1,B01GJQM5JM,"When I added V to my net flix queue I had no idea who made it or what it was about. I vaguely remembered commercial trailers on TV for it back in 2005. When I popped it in the DVD player I was appalled at its blatant hatred of the United States and traditional values. And when writing this review I was quite dismayed at the vast majority of other reviewers that either don't understand what this movie is truly about or are so brainwashed by leftist radicals that they cheer right along with V's anti-American, pro-Islamic terrorist propaganda.

You can read elsewhere for storyline, plot and setting. My comments here are centered on the movie's theme. That is America (the place where any gender, religion, creed or sect is free to pursue their own happiness in any way they see fit) is only one step away from Nazi Germany. Yet, Islamic terrorists (people who mutilate young girls as a matter of religious faith, blow up children, behead civilians, fly planes into skyscrapers, preach and attempt the genocide of entire cultures) are the enlightened one who are to be aligned with to save the world from evil Christians and Conservatives. The whole premise of this movie is sickening. Republican or Democrat, Liberal or Conservative; we as Americans should be outraged and united against people who whose sole purpose is to destroy our civilization. Not supporting them as this film does.

The most pathetic aspect of terrorist sympathizers, those who made and agree with this film, is that they have no concept of what radical Islam would do to them if given the chance. Do they really believe that the likes of Bin Laden and Ahmadinejad would embrace their lifestyles? To terrorists, America haters are useful idiots who would rapidly be dispatched in a radical Islamist State. Just when was the last time you saw a gay pride parade in Iran, for example? V for Vendetta claims that Christians and Conservatives are the totalitarians of the planet. Yet, when was the last time you heard Catholic leaders calling for the destruction of a Masque, or a Jewish Temple? Was it Saddam Hussein or the Pope who paid $25,000 to the families of homicide bombers? Was it al-Zarqawi or Mother Teresa who beheaded Nick Berg? Would the transgendered Wachowski be welcomed as a Muslim? Or would he destroyed along with all the other ""infidels"" that radical Islamists have sworn to kill?

If you believe that Osama Bin Laden, Ward Churchill, Cindy Sheehan and the like are the moralists in this world; if you believe that the U.S. government staged 9/11; if you ignore the U.S.S. Cole, the WTC bombing, the U.S. Embassy bombing, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbolla's public cry for the destruction of the West; if you are sympathetic to those who are sworn to kill you then this movie is for you.

But, if you recognize that terrorists are the enemies of freedom; that (most people in) western societies do not support fascist religious leaders and their followers terrorizing the world, then stay far away from this film.",1170460800,62,3006,4.797297297297297

Based on the popular graphic novel by Allan Moore, ""V For Vendetta"" offers a bone chilling view of futuristic London set in the year 2084, created by The Wachowski Brothers, the creative wizards behind ""The Matrix"".

In the year 2084, the world is at great odds. War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.

That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.

Backed by an excellent supporting cast, ""V For Vendetta"" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make ""V For Vendetta"" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.

This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from ""Saturday Night Live"".

7763498,5,B01GJQM5JM,An excellently written and acted movie.  Natalie Portman does a very good job as Evey. Hugo Weaving is even better as V.  If you take a close look at the movie you will be able to see a lot of parallels between the society there and the current administration in the US. However since the graphic novel the movie was based upon was written in the 1980's it would more likely compare to the Reagan administration instead of Bush's.,1169251200,2,430,4.430379746835443
7763499,5,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is a highly intelligent, fascinating and ambitious movie. The filmmakers present a story that dares to be thought provoking, unsettleing, and inspiring all at once. A cautionary tale which shows a disturbing future where it may not only be possible but all too easy for a liberal democratic society to willingly give up its freedoms and embrace a fascist ideology.

  To make such a film was courageous. Presenting a movie about a terrorist/revolutionary in this day and age of extremist violence entailed risk. It's a compelling, character-driven story that functions on many levels. A suspense thriller, a mystery, a political film and an action movie. The plot causes the viewer throughout to question whether violence is justified, whether the end justifies the means, and the definitions of terrorism, revolution and heroism.

  Captivating moviemaking and splendid performances by all members of the cast, especially Hugo Weaving as ""V"" who was nothing short of brilliant (his inspiring speech at the TV station alone is worth the purchase of the DVD), Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea as well as the cinematic irony of having John Hurt in the role of a power-mad maniacal dictator considering the fact that he played the part of a character who questioned the actions of an opressive government in the film 1984.

  The plot changes and twists as the story unfolds are unique to this film. This movie presents things NEVER attempted in any other movie. A truly remarkable motion picture.",1169251200,3,1507,5.118367346938776
7763500,4,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a remake of so many films, novels and historical events that we just wonder if it hasn't invented a new concept, that of the salad-bowl remake. Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always - today - in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer. He is a real friend that we may meet at any street corner of our mind or imagination. Have a firecracker for him and give a penny for the Guy.

7763502,5,B01GJQM5JM,"One of my friends saw ""V"" while it was in theaters and suggested I go. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with the reviews and decided against it. I didn't even think about the movie again until I was in my local library and saw it available for free rental. ""Oh yeah, THAT movie..."" I decided I might as well pick it up.

Wow. I was FLOORED. Not only did I thoroughly love the movie, but I watched it two more times before promptly buying my own copy. This movie is fantastic. It will certainly deal with challenging issues beyond what you'd see in most films out today. This movie does not ask you to love its hero or support his side. It presents two extremes and provides the viewer with the difficult choice of laying out his own choices much as the characters in the movie must do.

V is not your common hero, and the movie makes it just as easily to hope he fails as it is to hope he succeeds. Even the opponents V fights against are not without their redeeming qualities in the complex world around them.

I highly recommend people see this movie, and possibly read the graphic novels that inspire it as well. Many people find the similiarities between themes in the movie and the real world to be uncomfortable - but it should be emphasized that this story was written first, and if one mirrors the other, it is today's world mirroring the original vision in ""V for Vendetta"".

7763509,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Ah, this is currently my fave film.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched it.

I will say that when I first watched the film, I was confused as to why this terrorist, V, was being glorified.  But once the plot fully unfolds and all is made known, the reason for V being viewed as a hero is more than clear.

This is a tale of V, it is a tale of Evey Hammond, it is a tale of a fascist government run by Chancellor Sutler, impeccably played by John Hurt, it is a tale of revenge, it is a tale of mass conspiracy, it is a tale of love, it is a tale of so much more.  The complexity of the plot delighted me.

And the performances!  It doesn't get any better than Hugo Weaving as V, in my opinion.  He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor.  There are not a great many other actors who can emote that much feeling even sans masks!  And his voice!  It sends chills through me every time I hear it.  I truly fell in love with V.

Natalie Portman is magnificent as well.  She is so beautiful and a natural actress.  Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit.  Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling.

Stephen Rea is also excellent as Chief Inspector Finch.  The entire cast does a wonderful job bringing this film to life.

The look of the film doesn't disappoint whatsoever.  Being a Matrix fan, I loved the dark and gloomy, but slick look of V for Vendetta.  The knife fights where V takes on his opponents are absolutely stunning, not to mention the striking quality of V's black clothing in contrast to the stark whiteness of his Guy Fawke's mask.

I would greatly urge you to ride along with V, Evey and Finch on this fantastic and eye-opening journey.  Most highly recommended.  A masterpiece.",1168300800,3,1864,4.320809248554913

7763514,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Until reading other reviews on this site, I wasn't aware that ""V for Vendetta"" was adapted from a graphic novel, and certainly not aware that the author/illustrator was unhappy with the finished product. This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn. While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story. The only reason stories (I'm using that as a very broad term) are made into films is because the story invoked passion of some kind in its readers. Too often, Hollywood either doesn't understand what passions were invoked in the reader, how to translate those to film, or dismisses them entirely. However, oftentimes a story is far too complex, contains too many character, too many divergent plot lines, or too many ideas for a proper translation to occur. When that happens, we either find a script that cuts to the core of the story and eliminates anything that isn't absolutely essential to the story. That's where everybody has difficulty. Hollywood and the fans of the story rarely agree on what was left out, what was left in, what was enhanced - what was essential.

It seems, according to reviews here, that the film remained essentially true to its core, and trimmed around the edges. That said, many here disagree vehemently.

That served me fine. I didn't find gaping holes or questions, and never felt that any plot line was hurried. The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against.

""V"" was pursuing two things in the film. 1) To bring down the establishment, which had become increasingly totalitarian, and 2) to make those responsible for his creation pay.

Both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature. Some have said that ""V"" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is. This is no Batman, no Spider-Man, and certainly no Superman. He is not a crusader for good, and possesses his own set of ethics - undoubtedly burned into him in his birth. While I personally can't agree with his tactics, I never found myself rooting against him. The ""system"" that was in place was a horrid one, and it did need to be brought down - especially by someone who himself had been ""brought down"" by the system.

The acting is first rate, as are the special effects.

As I noted in the first paragraph, stories are made into film because the story invoked passion of some sort. This film certainly evoked passion in me. It's a terrifying reminder that totalitarian regimes have existed, that some have been created virtually overnight, and how perilously close we are now to slipping backward, instead of forward.",1168300800,55,2813,4.837837837837838

My expectations were wrong.

Although it may not be as deep as the graphic novel, they were able to jam enough details in a span of two hours without making your head spin. It managed to create a good balance of action, storytelling, and character development. Natalie Portman was an excellent actress in this movie and played the role perfectly.

The only downside is that the Wachowski brothers still do not know how to create a romantic scene! From the Matrix trilogy to this, it's unusual how  they create it.

Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read.  I am however, thoroughly disappointed.  They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.

The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security.  It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen.  Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.

As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less.  But for a fan of the graphic novel, the film adaptation is a poor reflection of a work of genius.  Do yourself and your brain a favor - read the book!!!!",1168041600,9,940,4.746913580246914

7763525,3,B01GJQM5JM,"One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, ""V for Vendetta,"" was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard ""Big Brother"" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.

Much of what made ""V"" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.

The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the ""Matrix"" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push ""V"" into the class of great action movies.  ""V"" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.

For visual appeal, ""V"" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like ""Van Helsing,"" ""Hulk,"" or the ""Matrix"" sequels, ""V"" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  ""V"" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.  This isn't a bad movie by any means - we're not talking ""Speed 2"" or ""Dune"" - but it is a disappointment when the high expectations aren't met.",1167696000,3,1986,4.785923753665689

7763527,3,B01GJQM5JM,"The movie takes place in futuristic Britian run by a totalitarian government and it's about the masked character known as V. V wants to overthrow the wicked government by blowing up buildings such as Parlament which will cause the people to rise up and take back the power. He also decides to kill a bunch of people that took part in horrible experiments where he was used as a test subject. Most of the movie is centered around Evey who gets rescued by V in the beggining and she slowly but surely starts to help V in his quest to overthrow the government. There is also a cop who's trying to find V and is trying to find out if his government is corrupt.

Through the movie there are some references to America's war on terror and the kind of horrible consiquences it brought onto the world which I thought was a nice touch because it could be like that in the future but we won't know for a while. My only problem with the anti Bush type themes is that they do it way to much and over and over again which got very repetitive and it seemed forced and they wanted to bring it up as much as possible. The few action scenes that they do have are good but there aren't too many of them. Also what's up with V's hair seriously.

Anyways due to the lack of action scenes and all the way too much anti totalitarian goverment talk makes this just an okay movie which should at least be seen once or twice but beyond that it's not really a movie you'd watch over and over again.",1167264000,2,1472,4.216312056737588
7763528,2,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is ostensibly an action movie with political overtones.  What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a ""hip"" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.

The main character ""V"" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution.  Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings.  Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she ""believes"" in his political endeavors.  All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder.  It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.

To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes.  At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference.  In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal.  The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester.  Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film.  It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.

This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on ""Animal Farm.""  And we have to remember that it came from a comic book.

So take a comic book and turn it in to a movie using the director that gave us the tower dung-heaps called ""Matrix II & III.""  Some movies are provocative and disturbing in a good way -V for Vendetta is not one of them.  [...]",1167004800,11,1703,4.837370242214533

One of them is ""We should not be afraid of government, they should be afraid of us"" and look at the last election what we did as a nation to change what is effecting us. Another thing that sticks out in my mind is history and the definition of ""terrorists"". Are the ""terrorists"" coming from an outside source? Or are they coming from within our own country? Are the ""terrorists' acts"" planned from our own country from people that we should trust? Or maybe we shouldn't have trusted them in the first place. If you look at history of the world from the witch hunts to Nazi Germany to modern day government, it is all ""controlled and guided"" by religious zealots trying to ""save society"" or ""save the children"". We should wake up as a ""world"" and save ourselves from them. I am with V in this one; everyone should have the ability to live in peace for whom and what they are. Not be controlled by government guided by religious zealots in how you should be or who you ought to be. Until then, there will be no peace.

7763537,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta is an extremely entertaining movie, with a dark character seeking revenge on individuals that deformed him while the government was doing plague research.  His severe burns are the primary reason he wears a mask.  In addition - the main character V (Hugo Weaving) uses extreme acts of violence to encourage anarchy with the public, with the intent to encourage the reversal of laws that have virtually eliminated personal freedom and expression.

Similiar to many revenge type movies, V is an intellegent, strong and extremely wealthy individual, and leaves you with the sense that he is mildy disturbed.

While pursuing his revenge, V falls in love with Evey (Natalie Portman), and she experiences his passion directly and indirectly.  Evey is not sure whether to love him or fear him.

The setting is future England (2020), and is not overly futuristic.  Some of the scenes can be described as extremely violent, but in an artistic way.",1165881600,,953,5.031847133757962

It is what most call an ""idealistic"" film that centers around a futuristic England where all chaos has been forcefully put to an end. In a world where disease, crime, and hatred became so rampant in America, a man by the name of Adam Sutler invented the role of high chancellor, and performed ""cleansing"" in England by initiating strict rules to create a seemingly perfect, ""Godly"", nation. The writers of this script wanted to show what could happen if our nation continues in the downword spiral we are in. They showed that the justice system can never be without flaw when Evey, the main character in the film, is out past the twelve o'clock curfew. She is confronted by a group of fingermen, who are the police of the nation, and they surround her. They threaten to beat and abuse her when ""V"", the defender of the innocent and punisher of the unjust, steps in and rescues Evey. This is just one example of how this movie shows the flaws in human nature. This movie was amazingly well written and directed. The characters and lines were powerful and moving.

7763541,3,B01GJQM5JM,"November 5th is Guy Fawkes night, where the British light bonfires in memory of Guy Fawkes, who attempted assassination of King and Parliament with a plan to blow up Westminster Palace.  'V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.

'V' (Hugo Weaving), as he identifies himself, has been a victim of the oppressive political overthrowing of a free government, and decides that revolution and death are the only answers to the world's problems.  Despite the dark sound of his schemes, it makes sense in the wake of the current leader's greed and incompetence.  Just before his first message to the government, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from a savaging from being out after curfew.

'V' and Evey meet up again as 'V' takes over a public broadcast, and this time Evey help him in return for his kindness to her.  'V' then takes her to his underground hideout to keep her safe for one year, until next November 5th when he plans to carry out his designs for a new government.  When Evey gets away from 'V', he doesn't stop her.

But neither 'V' or the government are through with Evey.  Evey becomes a prisoner and is tortured, emerging a stronger person from it.  Lots of secrets are revealed at this time, Evey's torturer, 'V's reasoning, and other sideline plots that were boring and belonged in a movie like 'Sleepless In Seattle' rather than 'V For Vendetta'.  'V' plans on bringing Evey in on his little November 5th celebration, whether she likes it or not, but not until he has taken care of his own personal business.

'V For Vendetta' could have been a great movie if they had stuck to a darker vein and left out all the distracting touchie-feelie moments.  About the middle of the movie, where the 'emotional' aspect really takes off, is where I got lost, and bored, and began to see this film as a passing bow to the movie-rating God.  I would rather have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.  Perhaps the producers were a little too frightened by 911, thinking ""terrorist"" rather than ""revolutionist"", but because of the wishy-washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.

My recommendation is to rent first, and make up your own mind.  Enjoy!",1164931200,,2381,4.644391408114559

Natalie Portman was outstanding and it was a great story with some unexpected twists.  Her performance alone was worth the price of the disc.

I'm generally not a big fan of action movies, but this was one of the rare action movies that makes you think.  I found myself pulling for the terrorist and thinking about how things are rarely as black and white as they seem.  The action scenes were fun, the writing was exceptional and the acting was outstanding.

7763543,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Set in a futuristic Britain, the story opens about about the story of Guy Fawkes and his legend. Being an American, I had no clue who Guy Fawkes was or is and if the legend was fabricated or if it really did happen.

The movie proceeds with introducing you to Evey (Natalie Portman) and in the background you can hear tirade from the ""Voice of London"" is loud and booming. while Evey looks into a mirror and applies her makeup.

I was hooked on this first scene because the ""Voice"" was damning and condemning in all it's viciousness. It makes you think of the facists that are currently beating their bibles over everyones' heads. I enjoyed the entire movie, including Hugo Weaving's (""V"") eloquent speeches and vernacular. I felt Hugo Weaving really was the star and made the ""V"" character come to life in such a vivid form.

Here is my favorite quote:

""Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those important events of the past usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot.""

As much as I love this movie, there was one scene that really didn't belong. Throughout the whole movie, it was philosophical and chilling.

There was a ""knife and dagger"" scene (towards the end) that just didn't belong. It belonged more in a horror or action-only film where that sort of thing is expected. But when you have a vengeful hero that has an eloquent dialect, then all of a sudden he turns into a throat slicing, body sawing, (you get the point) You really just want to fast forward through that part. Really, we all see action movies where there is NO plot and the main objective is cool bloody graphics and scenes. This wasn't the movie for it. It was tacky and distasteful.

That was the only scene, in my opinion, that felt out of place and out of step with the rest of the movie.

I highly recommend it to people who liked 1984 and other similar stories.",1164499200,,4401,4.506265664160401

The underlying story: (1) Guy Fawkes is an unlikely hero.  The Gunpowder Plot was to replace a religiously tolerant government (for its time) - the laws on religious conformity were largely unenforced (a version of ""Don't ask; don't tell"") - with a Catholic state that included the Inquistion.  Guy Fawkes had more in common with the autocratic government of this story than with the resistance.  (2) The victory against the dictator had been won before the Parliament building was destroyed, and that victory came from the leader being parodied and mocked on TV.  V's destruction of the Parliament building was an act of anarchism - destruction of institutions simply because they are institutions.  Realistically, you don't destroy institutions with long solid records because they have been briefly subverted.

7763547,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Some people absolutely hated this and others really loved it.

Many critics really panned this adaptation of the graphic novel, and the author of the original novel insisted on having his name taken off the credits - apparently before he even saw it. I thought it was a lot better than you might think from some of the critical reviews, but not something I will go back to again and again.

The film, like the book, is set in a future Britain some 20 years after a new far-right party has won power and established a police state. To be, or even to have been, a muslim, gay, trade unionist or a political activist can be a death sentence.

The heroine is Evey, played by Natalie Portman, the daughter of murdered political activists: at the start of the book she is rescued from police agents who were about to rape her by a mysterious masked man called ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving. ""V"" does not remove his mask at any time during the entire film, so Weaving has to act entirely with his voice and his body movements, which he does superlatively.

""V"" blows up the Old Bailey and announces that the following 5th November he will blow up the Houses of Parliament. He also settles some old scores by killing several senior government figures who had taken part in nazi-style medical experiments on gays and dissidents.

The special effects are magnifient and there is some excellent acting: both Weaving and Portman are very good, and John Hurt is superb as the deranged dictator, Adam Sutler.

For all that he is playing himself rather than acting, Stephen Fry puts in a great performance as ""Gordon Dietrich"" a broadcaster and comedian who has worked within this system for years but eventually cannot resist taking the mickey out of the government. Stephen Rea is brilliant as Inspector Finch, a policeman who has been a loyal supporter of the governing party for many years but begins to have doubts when he is ordered to track down ""V"".

The plot is, in places, very silly. ""V"" treats Evey in an utterly implausible way. The film starts with some misdirected hero-worship of Guy Fawkes, which if you stop to think about it is quite offensive.

Fawkes was a very close 17th Century equivalent of the 9/11 suicide bombers, a man who tried to blow up hundreds of people in an attempt to force his own religion on a country which didn't want it, and his legacy was to whip up fear and hatred against people of his own faith which lasted for centuries.

And before you ask, we Brits don't celebrate Guy Fawkes every 5th November - we celebrate the fact that he was caught before he and his fellow religious fanatics could bring off their version of the twin towers atrocity.

Having said that, if you don't take it too seriously, this film is a good piece of light hearted, escapist fun. Perhaps that's why those who did take the original graphic novel seriously detested it.",1163548800,,2873,4.59375
7763548,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is an interesting movie that won't allow you to remain indifferent. Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.

The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in ""1984"". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.

However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.

This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, ""V for Vendetta"" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace. From my point of view, this film is simply a must see.

7763549,4,B01GJQM5JM,"V is a scarred man who has a vendetta against a fictional totalitarian government because they did some wicked experiments on him and other captives. You see how crafty and deadly he has become in his attacks on government property, and you see how he slowly warps Natalie Portman's mind over the course of the film by convincing her that his cause his just and his approach is justified.

The movie is well done, and the acting is phenomenal, especially the guy who plays V. This is a film that gets under your skin, a movie that sticks with you days after your first viewing. Recommended for mature adults.

Natalie Portman is gorgeous.  Heck, she even looks great bald.  She also has a lot of potential as an actress.  She is perfect as the dark hero's side-kick.  Hugo Weaving is terrific as the vigilante.  He shows off the distinctive voice that we were introduced to in THE MATRIX series.

On some level, this movie seems to be a subtle attack at the Bush administration and all of the steps it has taken to absorb more power and subtract any sort of congressional oversight.  Cutting away civil liberties in hopes of gaining more security is almost never a good idea. The totalitarian paradigm of ""the ends justify the means of extreme government"" is as alive and well today it has always been.  Just a thought.....

7763557,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The Wachowski brothers' virtual opera prima (The Matrix Trilogy) is one of the few movies that I have absolutely and completely watched in awe. I was totally taken by surprise by it, as I never expected such a genre to  be so thought-provoking and deep to the point of pure and plain philosophical despair. Back then I even dared to define the ""Trilogy"" as ""subversive"" due to the unparalleled analogies between the fictional virtual world of Zion and its unbelievable reminiscences of so many realities in so many levels...
However shocked by The Matrix Trilogy, I still believed it to be just a lucky strike in the elusive and unknown world of a pair of siblings who call themselves the Wachowski Brothers.
My perception about the Wachowski's, however, drastically changed (and how) after watching the anarchic ""V for Vendetta"" (screenplay written by the Wachowski). As for the word ""subversive""... well it falls short to describe the kind of message taken out by all of these movies as a whole. And don't get me wrong here. I do not condemn the subject and neither its treatment or implications. On the contrary, I am thankful for it as it had made so many out there realize how  any form of fundamentalism (whether you call it communism, fascism, nazism, populism and also, anarchism) are so close to one another. Just like extremes of a serpent that bites its own tail. Fundamentalisms of all kind and the painful similarities between them (in scope, in methods, in objectives) should leave us all with a lesson. And I just hope that kids out there that watch these movies just for the fun of the amazing aesthetics and the overwhelming digital effects somehow get to see beyond the surface and dare to explore the undergrounds.

7763571,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Let us start with the premise that V is an excellent movie and work from there. The idea behind the film is timely - in this ""modern"" age, it seems somehow unpatriotic to suggest that ""governments should fear their people but people should not fear their government"". The acting is overall good and sometimes approached excellent as well, yet... yet... I was left dissatisfied. The strength of a movie of this sort is the believability of the plot and to reach it's conclusion, V forces a slight bit of unbelievability into what has transpired as an otherwise strong cautionary tale of what can happen to a people to ready to surrender freedom for security.

Nonetheless, V had to be made, V has to be seen. And the message should be heard. I gave the film 5 stars - the plot is 4.5, sets and direction, 5, acting 4 and message 5. It is a film worth watching and film worth owning - while you still can.

But alas, this is a pretty fine movie, whether it follows the outlines of the original V for Vendetta book or not. All in all it is rather engaging and enjoyable to watch... if you are so inclined, then you will probably think about it for a little bit (and perhaps read up on Old Bailey).

The plot concerns a literally faceless, mysterious man who dons the mask of old school anarchist Guy Faulkes. He, his name is V, goes around and blows up building and kills coppers. He also meets a girl. She is rather smashing. Apparently the actress also played a princess in the Star Wars movies (of course, here she wears much less make-up). The government wants to stop him because they think that they are right. Maybe they are? Maybe they are not? Who is to tell anyway?

Remember those guys that made The Matrix, well it was the same folks as made this nice little movie. As always, their movies are greatly concerned with seemingly pleasent societies that turn out to by dystopic in reality. Also, their movies are drenched in philosophical discourse. Just as the Matrix concerned itself with causality and whatever else, this movie concerns itself with the dichotomies present betwixt deontology and teleology. For those out there who are unfamiliar with the said terminology, look it up, eh... Regardless, this movie does not necessarilly feed you the answers to these questions, because it is quite possible that there are no answers to them. Apparently the comics are more morally ambiguous, but the moral ambiguity here was quite enough for me.

All in all, this was certainly a movie worth seeing. It killed off 2 hours of my day and I am not sad at all. In fact I am happy. I was able to escape to a world more miserable than my own.

First of all, I think it's a great idea of the future. Cuz who knows? Maybe that really is what we're heading for. And Evey(Natalie Portman)is totally awesome in this film. You've got to hand it to the girl for being able to be shaved and still look great.

And V in himself is such an interesting and spell-binding character. Yet he's hilarious at the same time, so open and honest, well just funny.

And the whole idea is just amazing, and beyond me. It's a horrible idea of a future, and V's going to make it better for anyone he can, the only way he knows. That's all I'm gonna say though. Don't want to give anything away.",1161993600,,775,4.222972972972973
7763579,3,B01GJQM5JM,"`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well.

The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.

That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down.

The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!",1161734400,5,2227,4.351089588377724
7763580,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say ""it can't happen here,"" but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.

The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.

It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.

Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.  The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.  V for Vendetta really is just a few plot holes and inconsistencies away from being a certifiable five-star film.",1161561600,,4001,4.884444444444444
7763581,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The dulcet and eloquent articulation by Hugo Weaving playing futuristic revolutionary known as V belies the powerful message of the film.  Director James McTeigue working with a script provided by the Wachowski brothers and based of the novel by Alan Moore creates a socially critical film in the mode of the classic story ""1984"".

In the year 2020 worldwide conflicts have fueled the creation of a totalitarian society in England led by the unyielding, dictatorial Chancellor Adam Sutler played powerfully by the accomplished John Hurt.  Having quashed the ideals of intellectuals, citizens live under fear of reprisal for wrong thinking.  Under these repressive conditons arises V, a lone voice attempting by terroristic acts to alter the shape of society.

During one of V's escapades, he comes into contact with working girl Evey Hammond played by Natalie Portman.  She comes to his aid as he attempts to take control of the government run television station where she works.  They form an uneasy bond at first and V takes Evey in his confidence.  We learn that both Weaving and Portman are products of their society.  V was a survivor of a government sponored experiment into biologic warfare.  Portman survived the destruction of her family at the hands of an unsympathetic government.

V who stealthily gets around in swashbuckling fashion cloaked with a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film, has designs to make a stupendous terroristic statement on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5th.  He schools Evey in his philosophy and together they work towards making major changes into societal structure.

The special effects and visual imagery were prodigious and the stunt work was also first rate.  Weaving, Portman and Hurt were all impressive in their portrayals.

The other bad line if you stop and think about it is ""It is the government that should be afraid of the people."" What does that really mean? Respect the people, maybe. A government that fears the people gives rise to dictatorships and genocide.

The movie has some intelligence in the dialog and the plot, but it gives not even a hint toward the answers. The philosopy is inane. Chaos for chaos sake seems to be the message. There are some nice plot twists, but one really big one that does not seem plausible at all.

7763588,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Based on Alan Moore's classic graphic novel of the same name, V For Vendetta is a look into the dystopian, not-so-distant future of England. In the original comic, England is one of few countries that have survived a nuclear fall out only to be run by a power hungry, right-wing extremist group. The movie adaptation by the Wachowski brothers wisely changes the post-Cold War/nuclear fallout scenario into that of a post-9/11 world filled with paranoia a la 1984, conspiracy, biochemical warfare, terrorism, and propaganda on a scale not seen since Hitler; the result is eerie and unsettling, effective in that it portrays a reality that isn't all that far removed from our own. Through the eyes of the female protagonist Evey (Natalie Portman), we explore the morality (or amorality) of the terrorist acts of V (Hugo Weaving) and whether the ends of his goals really justify the means. The emotions of Evey and rationalizations of V are played masterfully in the hands of Portman and Weaving making Evey's physical and emotional torment very real and V's philosophical ravings balance delicately on the edge of insanity. While the acting all around is top notch, the real stand out performance of the movie (as it should be) is that of Hugo Weaving--we never once see V's face and yet rarely is a character so affecting as this masked hero. The production of the film seems to be one long line of great decisions, among them John McTeigue's decision not to turn V into a simple action movie. The action scenes are neatly trimmed for efficiency and emotional impact; they occur at just the right times and never become bloated or stale. Perhaps best of all is that the audience leaves the movie excitedly discussing the messages of the film more than anything else, something that ought to happen far more often.",1160006400,,1812,4.867313915857605
7763589,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Some people just don't seem to get it.

I know we are in the middle of ""The War on Terror"" but some people seem to interpret everything in our culture as either Pro-Government or Anti-Government.  The same polarizing statement can be made about homosexuality.  Something is either completely Pro or completely Anti.  If someone does a documentary about the Holocaust and mentions Homosexuals were also targeted does that make them 100% Pro Homosexual?  Some reviewing this movie would have you think so.

I believe why this movie arouses such hate in some is because it is a little too close to the mark.  You can both support your government while at the same time not trusting it with unlimited power.  This movie is about a society that has signed over all its freedoms to a totalitarian regime for the promise of security.  Somebody posted that this could never happen to an advanced Socialist nation stating they never regress.  I say the opposite.  As any society begins to put more and more dependency on the government for their lives and well being they are only more willing to hand over more freedoms in exchange for additional perceived security.  I see a heavily Socialist society as more likely to cross over the brink into a totalitarian regime than many others.  America would be less likely to easily fall into this because of the basic structure of its Constitution but given enough of a push anything could happen.

The push in V is war, terrorism and plague resulting in a population filled with blind fear.  Perhaps because we already have war and terrorism in abundance with plague a constant threat in the media some people are a little touchy on the issue.  The movie is from a now insular English perspective.  It is not surprising plenty of fault is thrown onto the US.  That does not make it justified; it is merely a way of pointing the finger outwardly.  I would not take it any further than that.  Basically what happens is terrorism becomes very extreme to the point that people begin voting out of fear.  This causes a small hate mongering party to gather some power and is entirely plausible.  That party point the finger of blame at foreigners, Muslims, homosexuals, and any ""deviants"" who express doubt with regards to the measures this party believes are needed for safety.  The whole time the party plays to base of terrified English citizens who are in the majority.  It is always easy to get frightened people to point the finger at anyone different.  The leaders of this party are also somewhat religiously fundamentalist in their outlook, leading them to condemn all they consider immoral.  This is easy enough to do once they have the power.

This party does not have absolute power yet though.  While developing a biological weapon and antidote those party members involved in the program decide it would serve the greater good, and preserve England, to sacrifice a few.  The idea is the vast majority will see the real need for security and make the decisions that need to be made (i.e. put the new party in charge.).  The virus is unleashed on domestic targets with the goal of creating the most fear.  It works and the party of hate is swept into power promising strict measures to insure security.  Soon after the ""cure"" is discovered, thanks in part to the party now in power.

The main character blames the people for what they put in power and urges them to throw it off, while at the same time carrying on his personal vendetta against those who imprisoned and tortured him.

The movie makes a good point that you should never blindly trust your government.  Those who think that the point of the movie is somehow ""subversive"" and call it terrorist propaganda do not see the irony in their position...  That should worry people far more than a simple movie!

The movie is well acted.  All the praise placed on the actors already written is well deserved and will not be duplicated here.  It is also well shot.  I do think a few more details could have been revealed.  Not having read the Graphic Novel I do not understand just how V was as superhuman as he was, or how he accomplished so much alone (clearing bricked up subways and laying tracks?).  Perhaps it was something to do with the tests on him but it is never made clear.  I also thought that the time from when Evey left V (after the imprisonment) to November 5th was completely glossed over.  What did she do?  Was she a subversive or simply living under the radar?  It seems strange she would have such an awakening and then do nothing.  I did like the twist that brought Evey's awakening.  She had stated earlier that she lived in constant fear for her life and wished she did not, would give anything to not live in such fear.  As her father said ""Artists use a lie to tell the truth"" and that is what freed her from her fear.  The ending I found a little too cinematic.  I doubt that those fireworks could have been set up around Parliament and not been detected.

Overall I give it 4 stars for the acting, cinematography, and thought provoking story.  It would have been 5 if it were not as full of itself and needlessly vague for those not familiar with the source material.",1159920000,5,5192,4.617486338797814

The movie really developed the V character as a violent terrorist fighting for a good cause with human flaws.

The bad: A lot of graphic violence which I think was not necessary.  This is definitely an action movie made for people who enjoy watching violence. The movie also made me feel that it has a political agenda of promoting homosexuals. The movie does a good job making homosexuality look beautiful.

I literally almost cried near the end of the film because it was that powerful, although the only problem i didn't like about it is we never ever get a chance to see the face of a man who eventually saves the British people from a Nazi-esque government. Eventually he makes the one thing that Guy Fawkes failed at, destroying Parliament, while revealing the truth about the government that the people trusted. Although i would prefer the graphic novel over the film, mostly because this film was mostly made for Americans, because of the political problems that we are facing. V for Vendetta isn't about America problems. It's about freedom, its about anarchy against a corrupted government, its about England, but mostly its about the choices and the ideas you make that can change the world.",1159574400,2,1110,4.909574468085107
7763593,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Wow, this movie was great!  I can't believe so many people have panned it.  I am a lifetime comics fan and love Alan Moore.  I read V for Vendetta when it came out, and it didn't grab me as much as his other work.  I think this film actually improves upon the source material, and does it with syle and panache.  The political commentary is dead on, and the updating of the story has strengthend it considerably.  The film raises important issues about fear, freedom, judgement, censorship and terrorism.  This film is well worth owning.",1159574400,3,537,4.589473684210526

The government will tell us what to think.  But a rag-tag group of renegades will risk everything...to save mankind."")

That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie!  Very polished.  Great soundtrack.  But for people to say its thought provoking, suggesting it had not occurred to them that right wing politicians are ruining the quality of our lives, well, duh.

To be honest I thought there were some sincere aspirations until the end.  But once the point was made, and the masses were on the march there really was no need to blow anything else up.  But come on, this is pure entertainment disguised as something very serious.  Just enjoy--oh, and by the way, your National Identity card is in the mail.",1159315200,2,917,4.716981132075472

The comic had much more drug use and more anarchist themes, as well as V not being a simpathetic caring political warrior, he was much more of an anti-hero. But overall the movie was fabulous really showing what our society could be like in a few decades and I have been a fan of the wachowski bros. since the original matrix.

7763596,2,B01GJQM5JM,"Original, thought-provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self-adoring film.

So lets explore these ideas(and, in keeping with the movie, you can hate ME for this review but my IDEAS are bullet-proof!!!Muwahaha!).....

1) Original

PAlease. Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix-like fight scenes but, looooooooong siiiiiiiiiiigh, I was greatly deceived. I conitinued to watch in dismay as the plot frolicked into the land of  I'm Trying So Hard Not To But I'm Just Like Every Other Film and the script happily  meandered into Chock-Full of Cliches and Loving It region. There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical. He happens to be in the area to rescue a girl who happens to be beautiful and happens to work for the TV station he commandeers and happens to have a past full of rebellion. Yaaaaawn. Good thing no one believes in coincedence or else it would have been REALLY cheesy(winkwink). Of course we also have villians with 0 depth, corrupt clergy and politicians, oppressed minorities and a people rallying, sacrifical, bloody, huge explosion filled, staggering-to-the-one-you-love-just-to-be-able-to-utter-the-perfect-last-words ending. Are you asleep yet?

Original? A+ for effort, F for execution.

2) Thought Provoking

First, I will admit that V had several lines that made me smile or ponder a moment. But after his ridiculous usage of torture - the very thing that embittered him into his mission!!! - he rather lost all credibility to me. While V loathes the murderous society he lives in who kills people they don't approve of, he pracitces the same thing, killing those he doesn't approve of. He is different from them only in his opinion of what is right and wrong. He still enforces it in the same way they do - brute force. Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in... I just didn't buy it, but obviously, judging from its top of the box office 26.1million dollar opening, most everybody else did.

Thought Provoking? Provoked me to just enough thought to write this review and then banish it from my mind forever.

3) Daring

So it ""dared"" to ask the questions, ""What if another moraly fanatic control freak Hitler-type took over the world?""  and ""What if we were in a supremely controlled world where our every move was monitored by the government?"" I would say ""daring"" would mean if its a topic movie makers shy away from. Hardly. Just to name a few: The Manchurian Candidate, Gattaca, A.I., The Final Cut, Minority Report and of course, the Matrix Trilogy all explore this idea.

Also, the whole thing was blown so out of proportion that it succeeded in paralleling no one. It was far too extreme to be daring. It took some things conservatives believe and blew it up so much that only a handful of people could actually relate. It pretended to be ""in your face"" with the truth but, honestly, no one seemed to take it personally but simply nodded thinking it was addressing ""someone else"". This is called the SECRET SAFE ROUTE - make yourself look like you're willing to say anything while offended a maximum of 1% of the population.

Daring? Close but no cigar.

Ok, so the total of the above is a big whopping F. However, there were a couple things that inched it up to a C- on my scale.

1) Natalie Portman = lovely and believable performance, especially toward the beginning of the film. I think she will be one of those stars that just goes on forever, impressing if not a little shy of stunning us with her beautiful acting skills.

2) The cinematoghrapy, costumes and setting = The usage of color in this movie is very nice. We have a dark feel overall, spotted with some reds and whites and just when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story). All the outfits and colors fit the characters, although the Hitler-type motif was a little over the top. The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely. The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye-candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.

I don't mind so much if someone likes this movie(my boyfriend and my sister seem to enjoy it just fine) as long as you don't insult my intelligence by telling me its original, thought-provoking or daring.

So, my View is that I am the Victim of this Valient effort, which Veered into Vanity and Verbosness, concluding with Virtually no Value.

In short, V adored itself enough that none of us need to waste the effort.",1159228800,14,4712,4.779556650246305
7763597,4,B01GJQM5JM,"What makes V for Vendetta so interesting is that it is a different film then you'd expect it to be! V(Hugo Weaving) rescues Evey at the start of the movie from a few punks & at that point, I was confused cause I wasn't sure if he was a bad guy or a good guy having knowing nothing about the movie before I watched it other then the fact that Natalie Portman was in it of course. then he rescues her after killing many cops in which was basically blood bath after she watches him blow up a building & the movie has taken a dramatic turn. She's now his prisoner & he plans to continue his attacks of revenge against the government. V is an extremely experienced killer while no one knows his real name & we never see his face. but all his points against the government are valid & though I don't agree with him killing everyone as the solution, its his motivation that make this movie so different & so much fun! Of Evey(Natalie) escapes from the killer & they don't exactly become enemies as he keeps trying to get her to be like him & since they are still friends, sorta anyway, something happens with the both of them & they fall in love! & the final question is, will this effect Evey's decision at the end of the movie? Guess you'll have to wait to see what I'm talking about. It's a truly entertaining piece of work! recommend this to anyone who's looking for something with alot of action & makes some sense!

7763600,2,B01GJQM5JM,"I know I'm going to get mass bad votes on my review, but I wanted to put in my 2 cents.

As far as the movie goes, the visuals and acting were pretty good.  Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.

I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?

First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.

So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.  I'll only say that if you want to see a good movie about authoritarian rule without all the blatant political propaganda, go rent Equilibrium.  That's a 4-5 star movie.",1158710400,16,1594,4.392491467576792
7763601,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I loved it.

It's not just an action movie (though the action scenes are pretty decent). The plot is political and you could apply the same ideas to our current world.

If you care about dialogs, you'll love this movie. It's one of those movies that it's much more than just fights and killings. The main character was quite interesting (V)... His mask freaked me out a bit, but I got used to it after a bit.

If you're looking for an Oscar winner, look someplace else, but if you want a solid entertainment for 2 hours, get this movie.",1158624000,2,591,4.4036697247706424
7763602,3,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie shows a regilious, oppressive, totalitarian regime that does not tolerate other religions, gays, and secular art or music --- hmmmm, does this remind you of any present-day nation?  However, in the movie the totalitarian regime is run by Christian Fundamentalists reminiscent of Hitler with a double cross as its symbol.  The secret police carry badges bearing the double cross symbol and rapes innocent women staying out past curfew.  A key good guy is a gay TV show host who keeps an Arabic version of the Koran becaus he likes to read it as poetry (in Arabic?!!).  This movie will insult your intelligence if you take it seriously.  It reminded me of ""Sum of All Fears,"" where wealthy old neo-nazis, not Islamic Fundamentalistics, exploded a nuclear bomb in the U.S.  The heavy-handed political correctness in the movie just ruins the credibility of the plot.  The theme of people willing to give up personal liberty for safety is worth thoughful consideration and is reflective of the choices we need to make today to counter terrorism.  However, in the movie the need for safety was created by fake acts of terrorism engendered by the Christian Funadmentalist government to secure more power, not by external terrorists.  I commend the producers for their courage in bashing Christian Fundamentalists, without any fear of repercussions as depicted in the movie.

Apart from the laughably strained political correctness, the movie had excellent cinematography, good acting, but little action.  I was expecting a lot more fight sequences from a movie written by the Wachowski brothers, but there was only one good fight sequence which occurred near the end.",1158624000,9,1671,5.129151291512915

This seems to raise faintly disguised satisfaction in Britain. There is a terroist in London. He on the side of the people aiming to overthrow the oppressive government. For purpose of this movie, he is the good guy. He is pretty brutal & kills without hesitation, those that he deems, deserve it. He is inspired by Guy Fawkes. He plans to blow up Parliament on September 5. On that day  in 1605, Fawkes was to blow up Parliament. Fawkes was caught, tortured & hung. V wears a mask throughut. Natalie Portman is Evey & she's never been better. V saves her life & shortly she is involved in his activities. Both her parents had been murdered by this government & she has little use for it in any case. He does test her in a way that is cruel but ultimately helps her know her limits. They love each other but it is chaste & borne out of mutual admiration. I really like the whole feel of this movie. It did not feel like a futuristic fantasy.

7763605,3,B01GJQM5JM,"This isn't a review of the actual film (there are plenty of reviews for that).  I just wanted to give people an idea of what they're buying with this edition so as to avoid any potential disappointment.  The following is an opinionated description of the contents:

The DVD package itself is identical to the two-disc widescreen special edition. Thumbs up.

The lenticular slipcase has three modes (red circle-V, circle-V in flames, movie poster). The lenticular part is pretty cool.  However, the dimensions of the slipcase are not ideal.  Both the DVD case and the book must be contained inside the slip case to ensure a snug fit and to avoid colapsing the slip case.  Not so great.

However, the real sore spot for me is the inclusion of the ""64-page 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel"".  It's not the complete graphic novel, but only the first half or so  (spoiler: it ends when V appears in the coroner's / Larkhill doctor's bedroom). This was no mistake since the last page of the books states ""to be continued in the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel"". Thus, while the marketing blurb is not an outright lie (had I done my homework, I would have known there was no way the graphic novel would fit in 64 pages, and would have thus avoided disappointment), the marketing is indeed misleading. Stating ""Includes the first half of the 'V for Vendetta' graphic novel scaled to the size of a DVD case"" would be much more accurate.

I would suggest not going out of your way or spending extra money for this edition over the two-disc special edition, unless you're out to collect an abridged version of the graphic novel. If you're interested in the graphic novel proper, I'm sure you'll know where to start your search.

Cheers, and I hope this helps.",1158278400,78,1745,4.666666666666667

No we are not like this,but I think some would let us become like this. All in the name of safety and security. Anyway I loved the movie!!!",1158105600,3,494,4.15625

What I loved about this movie was that it was NOT predictible.  It kept my attention the entire time.  The actors portrayed their characters in a way that made you feel as if you were watching reality as opposed to entertainment.  No over-acting in this movie.

When the movie finished I found myself sitting in silence for about five minutes, just thinking.  I love a movie that awakens your senses enough that you're still pondering the story after the credits have finished.

Great entertainment on all fronts in this movie.  As soon as I find out if a director's cut will be released, I will purchase it.",1158105600,,761,4.4963503649635035

Im won't deny parallels to the government today, but films and books like this have been around for decades I mean this story is obviously based on 1984 as well as our current situation. But these stories get told as a warning not as some evil left wing attack. I mean honestly, if our government got as bad as the government in this movie, you would be pretty stupid not to raise up like the people in this film did. but for the time being our government isn't that bad, but thats not to say we arnt headed that way. So the point of the movie is to say, lets not let things go that far. It is defintaely not a direct critique of todays world, and if it was we would be in a lot of trouble.

So if your gonna give this movie a low rating for anything but that you thought the movie was badly made, or that it was badly performed, or even that you didn't like the differances from the book to the movie, you are indeed an idiot, and apparently think the government in this film is portraying the world today, and you are sick in the head to defend it.",1158105600,,1248,4.093877551020408

7763611,3,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta's world is one where a Christian RightWing governmentof some sort rules. It may be metaphor warning (as was Escape from LA  ) about the Religious Right asserting the ""dangerous outdated"" teachings of the wandering bum(get a job)Jesus on a modern and sophisticated population. It may be some kind of warning about Bush. It may be even be a government of LeftWing godless radicals who are hijacking Christian symbols as a vehicle for their own politics.

In any case it is a world, where Fingerman, deacon police of this Christic government, spawned from the gospel of Jesus, update his teachings for proper application in contemporary society. For example, Jesus said ""I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" These Fingerman, of take that tenant to a new and transcendental level by sexually molesting misrouted women (Natalie Portman) on the street.

Other sayings attributed to the ancient Jesus, depending upon translation include ""love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,"" and ""Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth, where thieves may come in by force and take it away"" along with other, similar platitudes, are revised and updated by the new faith off-screen to allow execution for possession of the Koran and the large unreasonable hording of wealth by the government's principle figures.

The hero is an ""augmented"" yet disfigured man who lives underneath black caped attire trimmed by a white smiling mask with a villainous molded mustache. We really never see what he looks like out of the mask. He blows up London's historical buildings and commits multiple assassinations that eventually tumble this government. He battles scores of enemies who own lots of bullets, his mailed out costumes require trains to deliver, and during his last act, the (insert spoiler here), I suddenly became conscious I was watching some sort of comic book.  This comic book, like most I've seen, has plot holes galore, preposterous events yet otherwise seems perfectly plausible and entertaining in its own environment.

It was not until later that I discovered the movie was INDEED from a comic book.

Natalie Portman, (yes I watched episode 2 and 3 again) is not sexy in this movie nor is she intended to be and she plays her role well, as some describe, a victim getting a grip on what's going on.

The film has a unique look to it, but I don't (as the DVD case indicates) consider it on the same scale as the Matrix.",1157932800,5,2519,4.896713615023474

7763613,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Predictably, the knee-jerk reactionists whose blinding, arresting political allegiances prevented them from being able to actually focus on the merits of the film itself unwittingly supplied us with an entertaining, if troubling textbook example of the narrow-minded thought police this film sought to disarm. To such dimwitted lemmings, thank you for substantiating the need for this film.

As for the film itself, it was, simply put, a work of sheer brilliance. Not as much a tool for ""the left"", as some automatons would have you believe, as it is a necessary statement on the manner in which political leaders, past and present, gain power and profit by imposing fear on society. Sound eerily familiar given today's abhorrent disgraces? If so, your mind is open. If not, your head is buried safely in the sand.

Natalie Portman and ugo Weaving provide powerful performances in roles in which lesser actors would be inclined to overract. Subtlety in performance can go a long way toward allowing a film to get its message across and the aforementioned executed their roles flawlessly in this manner.

I won't provide spoilers, but there are (many) scenes worth noting in this film, including the ""V""-laden preamble given by V upon meeting Evey, the sequences involving the imprisoned Evey, the scenes which detailed the events at Lark Hill, including the origin of his name, and on and on and on. This film was great on so many levels that its ""payoff"" exists throughout the film, and not just during its incredible climax.

For those who were put off by some of the Matrix's (another fine film) relatively disjointed, often esoteric sequences, V for Vendetta may prove refreshing in the fact that it provides more explicit explanations of its underlying meanings and origins as it moves along through the story. As such, the ""Ahas"" come more rapidly to the viewer, thereby allowing the viewer to focus more on the events as they unfold rather than focusing on what transpired eariler in the film.

In sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today. For those who can't seem to remove their political blinders before watching a film, I would suggest something more along the lines of a pro-war propaganda film from the 1940s. At least you won't have to actually *think* when viewing such a film.",1157760000,10,2391,4.923076923076923
7763614,3,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta, the film, is certainly not a bad movie but it is a poor adaptation of the brilliant graphic novel.  If you, like me, found the comic book version of V to be deeply moving and influential, I can't recommend that you watch the movie version.  If you haven't read the comic, go ahead and see the movie, but then go and read the far superior book.

Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (surprisingly) both provide very solid performances as V and Evey, and the design of the film was perfect.  My only problems are the changes to the script which diluted the original story and replaced it with a happy and unambiguous ending.  There are at least four important scenes in the original book's narrative; V's backstory, Evey's imprisonment, the history of the woman in room IV, and V's death.  The film only gets two of these scenes done well (the imprisonment and the woman in room IV) while the other scences were deleted or changed in ways which made them meaningless.

Judged on its own merits, the movie is not bad, but anyone who is interested in the storytelling should read Alan Moore's graphic novel instead.  Had the movie stayed true to Moore's original exploration of totalitarianism and anarchy, this could have been a masterpiece.  As it stands, its an engaging piece of entertainment but not anything more.

As a contemporary political movie, I was impressed that the movie was so willing to address issues of terrorism and treason against a totalitarian state.  Even if the movie was flawed, it opened up a much-needed dialogue about the extent of governmental control during an endless war on terrorism, and the low worth of a society which values its security over the freedom of its citizens.",1157673600,4,1717,4.747474747474747
7763615,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""Remember, remember the 5th of November,

The Gunpowder Treason and Plot.

I know of no reason the Gunpowder Treason

Should ever be forgot.""

Comic book geeks on both sides of the Atlantic during the '80s feel chills when we hear that snippet of poetry dedicated to Guy Fawkes.  It's quoted in the beginning of Alan Moore's second seminal comic work, ""V For Vendetta.""  For some reason, the book never seemed to get the dues it deserved, probably because it was ahead of its time when first published serially in ""Warrior"" (U.K.) magazine.  We who lived through those times, even as young people, remember in the U.S. and U.K. there was a feeling of super-patriotism and populism that many of us felt would lead to a new fascism.  Nowadays, those fears ring true again.

Purists should take note - especially if you're as (justifiably) persnickety as Alan Moore - that the film takes some liberties with the graphic novel's story.  It's been updated to reflect the new fascist fears of today, as well as the power of television and internet.  Moore was so incensed at the changes made by the Warchowsky Brothers that he fought a successful legal battle to have his credit removed from the movie.  I think I can understand why, as I've seen how Hollywood took his ""Swamp Thing"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and completely warped it from his original intent.  However, I think he would be secretly pleased at how much of the spirit of his story is maintained.

The themes of ""V"" are timeless - the use of fear to control and dominate, the willingness of the masses to turn a blind eye to persecuting the ""different"" in order to keep their feeling of security - and McTeague keeps this overall sense of menace and fear by showing us the new Hitler/Stalin, David Sutler (Susan in the graphic novel) mostly on television, just like everyone in that world sees him.  The stark symbolism of the double-bar cross used by the fascist Norsefire Party that brings together the twin tyrannies of repressive State and Organized Religion.  The messages of the film are clear, and well presented.

Is it perfect?  No.  Sometimes the pacing lags, and there are sharp changes of mood, such as the parody of Sutler on a chat show set to the tune of what I call the ""Benny Hill Rag"" (those who've watched the Benny Hill Show know what I'm talking about).  Yet the strengths draw you in; the previously mentioned moodiness and feeling of paranoic fear, the superb acting of Natalie Portmann (bonus for maintaining her accent), Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Hugo Weaving (even though it isn't him under the mask most of the time), et. al., and the lush attention to detail in cinematography, as well as stage design.  It all drags you in.

There aren't too many action movies out there that also demand that you think and try to draw conclusions.  It's all too easy to end up drowning in metaphor and lectures (which is what happened to the latter two ""Matrix"" outings), yet ""V"" in film form maintains that balance.  We are entertained after all, and called upon to think where we are heading as a people.",1157500800,5,3090,4.690166975881262

7763617,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Let us sing the praises of Hugo Weaving. Mr. Smith is one awesome actor.  Interesting that he hooks up with the Wachowski brothers again. After the over hyped over baked and finally collapsed souffle that was Matrix 3 I wouldn't want to associate myself with them anytime soon.

Here Mr Weaving spends the entire picture a Guy Faulks mask.  Any lesser actor would have been rendered into a basket case. Without his face to fill in the nuance of his character Weaving must use his voice and body to fill in the blanks.  Well to quote the W ""mission accomplished""

Weaving gives voice, passion, soul and believability to V.

Weaving is supported by Natalie Portman, forget the poorly drawn caricature that was princess forgettable in Star Wars 1,2 and 3. Given a good premise and real character development  she soars in V. This is because she has real actors to play against and well written script.  Yup sci fi really works when it's not written by a hack who is way too fond of his CGI toys.

Let me not forget Steven Rea's contribution either, his world weary Inspector is spot on.  His hound dog face extends to his character hound dog persistence.  While he is there to drive the story along and give some of the background on V he never falls into the realm of cliche.  You feel his pain and understand his persistence.  He is (belatedly) searching for the truth behind his government and ultimately his life.

Also contributing to cause it John Hurt and a truly wonderful score.  Set design and lighting are well thought out too.  The lighting has to do double duty as it has to help Weaving express the correct emotion. Remember that Weaving is acting behind a rather silly mask so lighting and cinematography have to be spot on, there is no room for error.

 The only real weakness in V is the premise itself. No not that the UK has slipped into fascist terror state.  Both the UK and US are just few ""Allah Akbar""s from that terrible future.  No it is that one person in a Guy Faulks mask pulls a somnolent public back to a freedom loving mass of citizenry in only one year.  If we ever fall down the rabbit hole of Fascism it will take more than few pounds of C-4 and a knife-throwing vigilante to set things right.",1157328000,5,2225,4.485074626865671
7763618,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie was so good in so many ways.  Please watch the movie, analyze the writing, acting, cinematography..., then analyze the ""messages""!

Disclaimer: I have not read the graphic novel, but I intend to.

The acting is first rate. Hugo Weaving was outstanding.  My first thought was, why hire a real actor for a role that never shows his face?.  Then I watched.  Weaving expresses all of V's emotions / thoughts without one actual facial expression.  Phenomenal really.  Must give credit to the directing as well.  It's remarkable.  Even Batman shows some of his face, making facial expressions a partial tool for the actor / directors.  They do it without this option.

The writing is first rate.  I'm going to watch it a few more times just for the script.  It's like poetry to me.  The dialog ranks high for me, on scale with a Tarantino film (pick one).  My wife pointed out that, in addition to the spoken word, the lack of speech is also important.  Example is, when V picks up the domino near the end of the movie he says nothing, just gives a look.  Most action movies would have some kind of cheesy line here.  This film needs nothing of the sort.

The story was spellbinding and hypnotic.  I had to pay attention to everything because there was a lot going on.  It was as interesting as a David Lynch film, but the story went somewhere and is clear in the end if you pay attention.  I did not move from the couch from start to finish.  Parts of the conspiracy reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK.  Masterful.  I would rank it close to masterpiece.

The use of the 1812 overture would be a cliche in most movies, but in this one it's perfect.  One of the most spectacular pieces of music ever written.  How appropriate.

The question of politics cannot be avoided.  Clearly it is a film with ""messages"".  This is not a standard action movie.  If you want an action movie, go rent Spiderman!

I have watched twice, and must say that Sutler bears little if any likeness to Bush.  Bush is a bumbling idiot and couldn't hold this guys microphone!  Sutler is like Hitler, and if you missed this, you were not watching!!  There are similarities, but my first and overriding thought was of Hitler.

I am very right wing on the subject of terrorism.  Yet I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It's not an indictment of Bush specifically.  If this is what you saw, you either were not paying attention, looking for something that was not there, or are very closed minded.  This is much deeper than anti Bush.

It is vitally important to continually question our motives, check our ""progress"", review our ""beliefs"".  If you come with an open mind, this film will cause you to do this.  True, the 1984 theme has been used countless times.  That does not take away the validity of using the theme again and again.  In fact, it's important to use it often so we don't wind up like the society in this film.",1157328000,6,2898,4.505791505791506

Do not be afraid of the similarities.  Instead, like some of the scenes in the movie, start asking questions of the politicians and self-promoters on both sides.",1157328000,3,483,5.413333333333333

Natalie Portman proves herself a capable actress. She has shed the stigma of child star with mature performances like in this movie or in Closer but she couldn't save this movie.

Even though the script is very well written, the acting is good, and the story moves along well the whole thing is just lacklustre. It's just another ""Be suspicious of Big Brother"" movie. And it's been done before and it's been done better. And it was done better even way back in the 70's with George Lucas' THX 1138 and Logan's Run. It just didn't bring a new look at the theme.

7763624,4,B01GJQM5JM,"This review is written for those that have already seen the movie, with the intention that they may consider reseeing it. This story was a just the retelling of the Matrix, the story about control. Here however the a fascist government took the place of the machines. The themes of choice, integrity, and causality were the driving force of the characters. No action is without a consequence. Hence it would be prudent to consider the consequence of our actions rather than our feeling towards them, because are feeling can be manipulated. The Wachowski brothers do an excellent job of showing how every character in movie including V struggles with doing what they wish rather that which they know to be right. We can see how easily characters such Creedy are tricked by V because they are driven by their anger. The most powerful part of the movie for me was V coming to realization with the consequences of his own actions, and giving up control for what he had worked so hard for to Evey, since she represented the people who have to live with consequence of his actions.

My only problem with movie and why I gave it 4 stars was that V forced the Evey the transformation process by torturing her. Yes she may have suggested in an attempt to win her trust that she wanted to be free of her fear, but that should have been her choice no V's. It would have been nice if their was more of a genuine desire expressed by her to free of her fear. Perhaps it was by forcing the process on Evey that V discovered that he was forcing this revolution on the people, rather than giving them a choice in the matter.

At the end this movie is not just about governments. It is about all those who which to control people, how ever noble their intentions are or pure their believes are. It is that warning that such action is not without consequence, and that universe will eventually break through and will not be stopped no matter how much energy you generate. I hope you will take the time to see this movie again.",1157155200,3,2007,4.4659400544959125
7763625,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I'm not going to compare this to other films. This one like every other movie, stands on its own. I can't stand the need of reviewers to compare films and make each new one an amalgamation of past films. They go on and on about how great they thought those were. I take each movie individually as it comes along. I don't care about who directed it, and what they directed in the past. I believe it does actors and directors an injustice to pull up roles that have nothing to do with the current piece under discussion.

I am purely and simply looking for entertainment. Take me away from the worries of modern life and show me something else, escapist entertainment. I should think most people are. I want impossible feats of heroism. I don't care if they're believable or not. I want fantastic heroes that can do things that I can never hope to do. The strong men or women that can ride to the rescue and right the wrongs of modern day life, from the bullies on the playground to the corrupt politicians. I want to see people who fly, and fight, and great car chases, wonderful illogical romances, magic and ESP. That's what entertainment is. It's fiction. Every bit of it is made up in the mind of someone, whether it's a book, play, or movie. The interpretation of that idea is what we see as a final product. Good acting is a must. A good script and good direction are also a requirements.

This movie succeeds briliantly in that aim. I was drawn into the story , it took my breath, and my attention until the end credits rolled. V is the mysterious vengeful antihero. I call him that because he's definitely not too sweet. I thought the girl's name Eve, to be telling. The acting was good without being over dramatic. The people that played the roles seemed to fit the roles well. No, I am not going to spoil the movie with a blow by blow account. I believe it's important to view a movie without any prior seeds planted by someone else who liked it or disliked it.

If entertainment is your aim then this is a great film. I was absolutely amazed. This was great after all the other garbage that Hollywood has produced, tried to dress up as entertainment, and shove down our throats in the last five years or so. They keep slinging it out despite the steadily declining theater audiences.

The plot is not too twisted to grasp easily, even though there are some surprises. There is plenty of action for the action buffs. There is a moral message for the conscientous. There is a very scary political message not even thinly disguised. ""The people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of the people."" There isn't any sex, this movie doesn't need it. There are however a lot of emotions.

I cannot for the life of me get over all these arm chair critics. Even though for the most part they've been positive. I don't care what they have to say. I want to see it for myself. That is always my advice. Rent it. Watch it. Like it. Buy it. Don't take my word for it, or that of anyone else. Don't let someone's idea of what a great movie, of what great entertainment should be, make you miss something you might enjoy, or influence you to buy something you will hate. I learned that a long time ago, it remains my practice today. I've never regretted it. I have loved movies that others wouldn't give one star. I have hated with a passion movies that others gave five stars. So rent it and make up your own mind. I've bought my copy of "",V for Vendetta,"" and I've watched it several times already. I don't own any DVD's that I don't watch again and again.",1157155200,3,3590,4.392481203007518
7763626,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Starring Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry

It's the near future and the United States is destroyed by its own greed and all the wars it started. Our focus England has become a fascist state headed by a religious maniac. Gays are hunted and killed - and the Koran is outlawed. One poor gay television producer/host had a secret stash of outlawed art and he also had a Koran. Bad news for him. He's beaten to death by the not-so-secret police. You mustn't have a Koran. The symbol of the new regime is the double-cross.

The powerful men in the country all made their money from drug companies. Where else? The drug companies are the great villains of the left - as if they don't hunger for drugs to cure them of their various diseases as do right wingers.

Now this is a very good movie about revolutionary zeal in the face of oppression and I recommend it but I have strong intellectual reservations. We don't need to create a Christian, double-crossed, wacko fanatic madman leader of England when the Muslim fascistic movement is in full steam right now across the globe and they are the ones who already have these types of oppressive religio-manic societies. Gays? Where do you think a gay is safer? In a Margaret Thatcher England or in (pick one): Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iran, Iraq or in the communist states of North Korea, Cuba or the dictatorship of China? Where would you rather be gay?

The movie suffers in my view with being way too knee-jerk leftist - as if blowing up England's Parliament, the movie's spectacular climax, means that ""we the people"" will have more power when in fact without the parliaments of the world, ""we the people"" usually get our buttocks kicked. And the drug companies! Are they villains again? Are drug companies the enemy of the people? I take drugs created by drug companies that have saved my life. They aren't villains to me or millions like me who are alive thanks to their research and development.

Do we really have to fear the right wings of London politics when the true thugs are plotting explosions on subways and airplanes. The fascists who are about to take over don't use the double-cross as their symbol.

Highly enjoyable and thought-provoking, this is a film you will remember long after it's over. Dares to explore--via an action-packed story--what's really behind the BS propaganda that's passed off as ""truth"" in our overly distracted times. Question to consider: How can V be called a ""terrorist"" when his targets are specific people guilty of terrible crimes and ongoing terror themselves--along with symbolic yet empty buidlings--as opposed to ""innocent bystanders"" and/or noble leaders? For example, had he been around in Germany in the early 1940's and taken out Hitler, Himmler and Goebbles while also blowing up the Reichstag and the Nazi judicial court headquarters, wouldn't most everyone cheer him on?

Of course, revolution is forthcoming, thanks to the acts of our masked hero and his unlikely apprentice. But what about the political bone that is humerously picked throughout the film? Didn't see that one coming, eh?

Our persecuted consist of anyone who is not standard, particularly homosexuals and Muslims. And wouldn't you know it, the persecuters are ""deeply religios"" individuals led by their Adolph Hitler lookalike leader.

Smell an agenda? Oooooh, but it smells oh so sweet. I have to admit, I laughed at these contrived segments of martyr-mentality propaganda. Islam is under attack. Gays are under attack. I'm sorry, but I don't see this happening in the future. Call me naive, but the world seems quite cozy with both of these groups.  Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and Europe is currently leading the world into the new gay-friendly political scope.

I think the overall premise of the film could be a distinct possibility, but the persecuted will be different when that day does arrives.

V for Vendetta was by far one of the most powerful movies of 2006 (and up there with the most powerful movies ever for that matter)!  I actually fell asleep too during the beginning the first time I watched it because it was LATE and I was TIRED, but a few days later I started it from the beginning & was completely blown-away.

It's interesting how the Big Brother philosophy is tied together with a semi-Christian fundamentalist idealogy. Usually these ""big brother"" movies show government as soulless. My first thought after seeing this movie was ""this is probably how it happened in Nazi Germany"". When people are desperate or afraid (as Germans were in the early 1930's) they will sometimes accept anyone who ""makes the trains run on time"". Putting the politics aside, the movie was beautifully photographed. The atmosphere captures a sense of film noir, especially when dealing with the city streets.

If you're looking for a good movie based on a graphic novel without all the preachy politcal propaganda check out Sin City.",1156204800,96,892,4.58125
7763641,4,B01GJQM5JM,"That's exactly what I was thinking while watching V for Vendetta.  The hero is, yes, a terrorist - a well read, articulate terrorist who loves music and old movies and has plans to change London by blowing a good deal of it to smithereens, unseating a fuhrer-esque dictator of a totalitarian regime full of shadowy underlings from power and, in turn, give the city back to its people, for, as V himself says, ""People should not fear their governments, governments should fear the people,"" or something to that effect.  V spends a good portion of the film donning his mask and debonair get-up as he dispatches one by one a group of people with dark ties to the masked avenger himself - think secret government-funded experiments, concentration camps, etc.  He reaches out to the people of London by highjacking the television airwaves to deliver his message of revolt.  He rescues and befriends a cute-as-a-button Natalie Portman.  He blows some stuff up.  And, one year later, he plans on destroying Parliament.  Talk about a revolution indeed.

As action films go this one certainly has a bit of brains and is, by far, better than most.  Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore who has universally hated all of the big screen adaptions of his work and subsequently had his name removed from this film, but nevertheless accepted the check, I'm sure, and cashed it hastily.  The Maxtrix team wrote it - the  Wachowski Brothers - and it is directed with style and flare by James McTeigue.  Good show!  Did I mention how cute Natalie Portman is?

This movie might not have been made a few years ago.  That was another thing that kept crossing my mind while watching V for Vendetta.  I'm not quite sure what the message of the film is, if any.  Can terrorism be justified?  Interesting.  Check out the movie - it's pretty good by the way - and chew on that one for a while.",1156118400,14,1870,4.62917933130699
7763642,5,B01GJQM5JM,"If you're reading up on V for Vendetta, you likely already know that it is based on the comic book series/graphic novel of the same name, written and illustrated by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, respectively. Alan Moore has detached himself from the film completely, likely because it does not follow his work completely. This is understandable. Being a writer myself, I imagine if I saw my work brought to the big screen with so many changes, I would have a fit, too. But looking in from an unbiased perspective, having not written the novel and only being a fan, I disagree with this notion entirely. The movie, while it makes several sacrifices in terms of extraneous characters and such, also streamlines the story yet still makes it an incredibly unebelievable movie.

The plot takes place in near-future London, England, where a totalitatian regime called Norsefire, led by High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has taken hold. 'Fingerman', or secret police, roam the streets, arresting at will. Audio surveillence and wire taps are the norm. Difference is bad; homosexuals, Muslims, and the like are persecuted. The setting is very convincing. If you were to walk into London today, I can't say it would look much different from how the movie depicts. This strengthens the films impact.

Enter V, a freedom fighter (or terrorist?) who plans to bring down the oppressive regime. Spectacularly voices and acted by Hugo Weaving, V is an extremely intelligent man who, strangely, remains hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask. It just so happens that he runs into Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a timid young woman being assaulted by several Fingermen. To say any more about this first encounter, or these characters' backgrounds and histories, would be to spoil a well-thought out plot that will have you recoiling in disgust, cheering, and questioning actions of the many characters, particularly V.

Due to the film's material content, it is unfortunately subject to much criticism. Many individuals proclaim it as a bash against the Bush administration, others say it glorifies terrorism and that the film is ""evil"". This is cheapening what V for Vendetta really is. If you really think V is a terrorist, that is excellent. Why? Because that is the point of the movie. It is to get people to talk. Is V a terrorist, or is he a freedom fighter? Saying the movie glorifies him is incorrect as well. The movie tells you to voice an opinion, not what opinion to voice. And that is a beautiful thing.

I don't want to appear biased; I am not a supporter of the current administration, but I am also not outspoke at all against it. Perhaps you could say I stand in the middle ground. If you are interested in this film, SEE IT FOR YOURSELF. Do not let hot headed right-winged conservatives convince you that this movie is propaganda. If parallels are seen between this film and the current U.S. government, then perhaps there is indeed something wrong with our great nation's regime.

Everybody should see this film. It is deep. It is moving. It is thoughtful, delivers many themes and messages, and is chock full of symbolism and dialogue that will have you deciphering during your many viewings. The film is about people. Sure, it is political commentary. But it isn't saying, ""Oh, Bush is evil,"" or ""Bush=American terrorist!"". Again, that is cheapening the many elements of V for Vendetta. If anything, this film is anti-Nazi. It speaks against the complacency of people under oppressive regimes, it urges the people of all nations of the world to be mindful of their government, and to not let themselves be lulled into a state of fear, such a state in which they would be happy to give up their freedoms for ""security"". That is what this film speaks out about, and against.

The DVD itself includes very few special features. A few documentaries, one or two are interesting, the rest not too noteworthy. There is on that explains who Guy Fawkes was and what he intended to do, so I do suggest watching that at least.

But the content of the DVD is the film itself. Words do not describe this film; it has to be seen, and understood. Honestly, you either love it or you don't. I will not sugarcoat it: many who don't like it, just plain don't understand it. But whatever the case, everybody should watch this and decide for themselves.",1156118400,11,4335,4.802949061662199
7763643,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Lord knows what bug Alan Moore has up his bum, but having read the COMIC BOOK and seen the film, I don't get what the brouhaha is all about. He and David Llyod collaborated on a COMIC BOOK, not Moby Dick. If there were concerns on an artistic front, Lloyd would be the one, but this is essentially a COMIC BOOK story fleshed out with live actors and special effects and it's all extremely well done and true to the source, i.e. a COMIC BOOK.

As a movie, it's a lot of fun to watch, and makes a lot more sense than the soft-headed geeky-theory of The Matrix trilogy. It's all derived from Orwell, of course, but the effects are good, the acting is over-the-top without resorting to Star Wars platitudes or Johnny Depp ham-fisting, and there is a point to the story, and given the political climate in the world today, it is hardly far-fetched. There is a fair amount of ironic US-bashing, well deserved and on target, and the England on offer here is Margaret Thatcher's wet dream. That may tell you a little bit about the times in which the story was conceived, but to everyone's credit, it is told crisply as though it were a straight narravtive. That helps enormously in a film. The director got the point of letting the graphics help tell the story and set the tone. Nothing is gratuitous, and that's notable all in its own right.

My quibbles with the film are slight: sound balance is way off: Hugo Weaving's dialogue is in such hushed tones that I was constantly adjusting the volume to hear him recite Shakespeare, then backing it down for the explosions. For that matter, it may not even be Weaving behind the mask. His voice over might well have been phoned in. V nods toward Eavey or one of the other characters, and there are action sequences, but nothing to suggest that Weaving is actually there. Still, it's a good film.

The extras are for the geeks.

I go back to the Moore dust-up. My guess is he's a stereo-typical art student who wants to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. I suspect it's all contrived anyway. As David Lloyd opined: if he is that upset, give back the check.

For everyone else, enjoy the film, it's a good story that ought to be told in these times.",1156118400,4,2196,4.439205955334987
7763644,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Having never read the graphic novel, and by seeing this movie on a sheer whim I have to say that V is one of the best contemporary action films to come out in the last decade. I've never seen a movie that combines such fresh action sequences with such intellectual dialogue and comtemporary social and political issues. V is like no other movie I've ever seen. The cinematography is just incredible. There is really never a dull moment. BTW for fans of the movie be sure to check out the site THEFUTUREISOURS.com they're giving out the V costume (which is rumored to be worth several thousand dollars)",1156032000,6,601,4.626168224299065
7763645,3,B01GJQM5JM,"First, the good news. This is a pretty exciting story and a pretty will made movie.

Now the bad news: It is a dangerous piece of political propaganda.

One of the themes of this movie is that lies are told to reveal the truth. And so it is with this movie although the revealed truths are not those ""truths"" that the movie makers intended.

The nutjob left loves this movie. DU and other moonbat websites have threads in which they are trying to incite mass demonstrations of protesters with Guy Fawkes masks. Indeed, Fawkes masks are beginning to show up at srewball protests. The reason this movie has struck such a chord is frightening.

This movie is a celebration of blind, mindless hatred for the purpose of inciting blind, mindless hatred and ensuing destruction. The movie makers would disagree with my analysis and would mostly likely says that the main theme of the movie is that a government that rules by manipulating terror must be destroyed by terror.

Although set in the UK, the government is clearly modeled after the Chimpy W. McHitler administration. For example, the bad guy soldiers are wearing American helmets and uniforms. Be that as it may, unless you already believe that W either caused or knowingly allowed terror against American citizens for the purpose of achieving and retaining power, there is nothing in this movie to convince you. You are to take it as a matter of a faith that W was behind 9/11 and that such tactics are the essence of the vision of his administration. And thus terror is justified when used against the government.

None of this, however, is explained or attempted to be explained in any intellectual way. Rather, your hatred is to be your guide. Just as you are to condemn the government without benefit of any evidence, you are to accept terror as a tactic without benefit of any plan. The plan is to blow up Parliament* which will automatically cause the government to fall for no apparent reason. The purposes are mindless hatred and destruction.

The movie ends with Fawkes' dream enacted, Parliament destroyed, and the government leaders murdered. No thought is given as to what comes next. To do so would raise all sorts of difficult problems. If a new government were to be created, there would have to be some thought given to what form of government that would be. It couldn't be a democratic government because, after all, that is the form of government that brought Chimpy to power in the first place. But if not democratic, then what? Better you don't ask. Our hero and heroine achieve orgasmic joy in accomplishing Fawkes' dream of mindless hatred and destruction and that is all you need to know. One cannot help but be reminded of the Democrat Party's campaign once again in 2006 that is again, as in 2002 and 2004, that we-are-not-Bush and otherwise devoid of any idea or solution. Mere hatred is enough.

The setting of this movie includes a deeply censored culture in which the slightest criticism of the government is cause for execution. (Indeed, possession of a Koran is grounds for execution, indicating that it is Christianity that uses terror on Islam rather than vice versa). Yet the mere fact that this movie was made and distributed disproves its very point, that we live in a fascist state. But here again, the idea is subjugate thought to hatred. Just kill and destroy and you will feel better.

This is a dangerous movie. Although any mentally healthy adult can watch it without being led into a life (or death) of terrorism, the emotionally unstable may well be incited to violence by the paranoid vision of this movie. And as not only the plethora of suicide bombers in the Middle East but also a glance at Democratic Underground reveal, there is no shortage of the emotional unstable. And, indeed, this movie is intended to incite the excitable. But we do live a free country so view away. Just keep your eyes open about what this movie is preaching.

One final irony is that this is a pretty good, exciting action picture. If it just didn't try so hard to convince you that this is contemporary or near future America, this would be a fun movie to watch.

* One of the ironies of this deeply anti-religious movie is that it misconstrues or ignores the essence of the Gunpowder Plot that is used as a model. Fawkes was a deeply religious, one might say militant, Catholic whose was attempting to instill Catholicism over the objection (and bodies) of King James I and the members of Parliament. In the movie, the motive is to remove the influence (malevolent of course) of religion, not to instill it. But no never mind. Guy Fawkes is the inspiring secular saint because he wanted to kill and to destroy and that it what is important, to kill and to destroy.",1156032000,9,4747,4.70722891566265
7763646,5,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of a few films in recent memory that transcends its current socio-political environs and reaches across the vast expanse of historical precedent, social experience and collective conscience. Precious few works of art in our post-modern era of self-aggrandizement have accomplished such feats with such ease. We are presented with warnings of ghosts past, portends of an ominous future and lessons to be learned once again by our increasingly complacent populace.

To look at this film and its cogent sense of perspective, one must verily understand its reference to historical periods, though often lauded, present us with a multitude of lessons to remember. The fall of the Roman republic, the Inquisitions, religious zealotry and its brethren political arms, McCarthyism, the reactionary fascism of the 20th century culminating with the death of millions, leading to a climax of our current climate of religious fundamentalism, the subversion of individual rights, freedoms and free will to the grander view of the state.

Individually, the film has deftly used symbols, referenced symbols and discussed symbolism to achieve its aim. Symbols are both powerful subservise agents as well as liberating ones. Subtle and not so subtle references to the idolatry of the Third Reich, the mind numbing rallies and heils of the rallies at Nuremberg, the talking heads of our current media machine, the garb of Abu Ghraib inmates, and the inimicable face of hero/revolutionary/terrorist Guy Fawkes all serve as poignant reminders of what we are to be seeing in this film.

The selection of Hugo Weaving, in and of itself is a triumph; his voice, his mannerisms, all lend themselves to the somber , sobering, pensive yet expressive timbre of the revolutionary that we long to hear in times of need. Witty use of alliteration, references to the morbid Macbeth and the flighty Twelfth Night only add to the illusory world that our hero both leads us into and out of. Fawkes' coutenance only lends itself further to the idea that our real world and our real personas lie beneath the surface.

Perhaps the most relevant and wonderful reference is to that of Edmond Dantes. V's struggle parallels Edmond's to the T. Imprisoned in a tower, receiving notes from a stranger, escaping, living a life of luxury free want want, surrounded by great works of art, yet still hidden from his true self, tormented by demons long thought exorcised.  Vengeance, remembrance, forgiveness, redemption and love.. all motifs that run deep through the undercurrent of this film, and throughout its historical and literary reference. All of which add to the  power of its message.

Are we to be supplicants to the state; at what point do we fear the direction that the collective has taken on behalf of the individual. Orwellian references aside, more powerful and sinister forces are at work around us.. and what we are presented here with is a well crafted, cogent message to be heeded. Not mired in the muck of the usual superficial  Hollywood 2 hour long drones, V for Vendetta is a feast for the senses and a veritable smorgasbord for the mind.",1156032000,5,3141,5.05019305019305
7763647,2,B01GJQM5JM,"I have never read the Alan Moore graphic novel but I suspect it is worthy of the hype. This movie however is not. This movie is a rehash of various other cultural representations: most notably Big Brother and Hitler's Germany circa 1940. I can get behind stories about overthrowing oppression and injustice but this movie had nothing new to deliver. Yes V is the shady hero who was `created' by the government state and eventually brings their power to an end. This theme has been done by better novels and films so many times I can't even begin to list them all. Needless to say, this film offers nothing exciting or new to the genre.

If I had known the screenplay was written by the Matrix brothers I never would have seen this film. These clowns are still running from the crime scene of the Matrix sequels and some producer figured they could get another yacht or two if they adapted another comic book to the big screen. Big mistake. I actually fell asleep watching this movie, and that hasn't happened since I saw some diseased Jennifer Lopez movie.

A huge disappointment in the film is the Natalie Portman character. Portman has the accent down but that's the only good thing about this gig. Her character is lame. She is a nonentity in a film that focuses her as the main character (I think). Basically this girl has been oppressed and wronged by the government but when she `awakens' or whatever, she turns into a window shopper for a year. She literally just walks the streets.

Anyway, I can imagine the Matrix brothers typing away at their computers with lofty goals of blending the `1984' genres into something new and cool. In the end, this movie does nothing of the sort. It is predictable, unoriginal and tiresome. And what is up with the crappy cartoonish violence? Not good like the over the top Kill Bill, but boring and leaves me asking why?",1156032000,4,1863,4.605421686746988
7763648,4,B01GJQM5JM,"this movie is not for everyone.  People who liked ""1984"" will love this film; those that didn't, will probably hate it.  It is visually appealing in a very dark way; but then again, if your tastes lean towards lighter, fluffier scenery, you won't agree with my statement.  The actors did a good job, especially Hugo Weaving.  I did have a hard time getting into him at first because of the mask, but after a while, you learn to appreciate it.  This was also one of the better jobs by Natalie Portman in the past few years (although she was good in Garden State - a very good movie btw).

Also, this is JUST A MOVIE - made for entertainment.  It's not going to change the world, for better or for worse.  Governments do that well enough without being influenced by a film.

Like I said, view it with an open mind and perhaps you'll appreciate it.  I know I did.",1155945600,3,860,4.31875
7763649,4,B01GJQM5JM,"A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own ""good"" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.

Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.

The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!)

Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.

But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.

In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.

This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.

There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to ""protect"" its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C). Connect your own dots and see where V leads you.",1155945600,5,3429,4.574918566775244
7763650,3,B01GJQM5JM,"This is a well made movie. It is enjoyable. But once again, we are asked to believe that the largest threats to our way of life come not from radical muslims and left wing loonies like Hugo Chavez, but from Christians, and from business corporations. The only truly free civilizations on this planet have come from the combination of those two entities. And now, they are supposed to be the bad guys in so many movies and comic books. What mischief is this causing to our culture?",1155945600,16,480,4.528735632183908
7763651,3,B01GJQM5JM,"In the latest film from the Wachowski brothers viewers are given a visually stunning look at an alternate future in which a naziesque British government becomes the target of one man's brutal vengeance campaign. Hugo Weaving plays V, the masked avenger to whom an obtrusive failed coup 400 years ago on November 5th plays apocalyptic importance. Natalie Portman co-stars as Evey, an innocent bystander who becomes entangled in V's plan and ultimately finds  herself in love with him (even though he nearly tortures her to death in one of the odd subplots that just doesn't work).

The movie is filmed with earnestness and vision, blending flawless special effects with a thought-provoking story about freedom, vengeance, the role of government, the importance of individuality, and the quest for truth despite the consequences. However, rather than rise to the occasion, the Wachowski brothers take a detour into using the movie to make social statements that seem to be added not because they are organic to the story, but because they are important to the filmmakers:

* Those who believe in God are cruel, repressive, homophobic and hypocritical. This caricature becomes so overbearing you eventually think you're watching a propaganda film rather than an action-adventure.

* The ends justify the means for individuals but not for governments.

* Vengeance, including terrorism and mass murder, is acceptable as long as you were disfigured years ago at a top-secret government facility.

* Mercy and forgiveness are weaker moral responses to injustice than murder, torture and revenge are.

In the end, the movie is a letdown as it becomes encumbered with trying to make a point rather than tell a story and viewers are left feeling like they're supposed to be cheering for a victory that seems like a defeat. Let the Wachowski brothers have their Vendetta against society and watch `The Matrix' instead.",1155945600,19,1908,5.175324675324675
7763652,5,B01GJQM5JM,"When I first saw this movie, I was blown away by its disregard for social mores. It completely goes outside the standard Hollywood fare by taking on a real issue in contemporary society, while not working to ""dumb-it-down"" for the average movie-goer who is not interested in thinking.

The United States is no more. It is in ruins and subject to civil wars and rampant disease. Does this sound familiar? It should, the United States in the future is Iraq. The ""American"" wars have devastated the world and withered away the nation's resources, while garnering the world's disdain and hate. The movie takes place in the near future in Great Britain. Britain is no longer a democracy, but instead it is ruled by fear and rampant misuse of power and resources. A secretive despot (called ""Chancellor"") sits at the head of the nation. His location is just given as ""underground,"" and he always speaks to his sycophants and the nation from this secure location. The Chancellor hates anything/anyone that gives him a tough time or might challenge is unyielding authority. He uses unfounded fear and Christian morals to maintain his authority. There's even a color-coded curfew system, which everyone is required to follow or suffer dire consequences. Does the Chancellor sound familiar? Again, he should, he is George W. Bush. The mouth of the Party--as they are called--is a government controlled 24 hour television station monopoly, called British Television Network (BTN), which ""spins"" the news to benefit the government. It is embodied in a building called Jordan Tower, which to me represented, perhaps, the Pentagon or NSA, where Fox News had relocated. It is complete with Christian inferences. Ironically, one BTN host states during his program, ""I'm a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm goddamned proud of it!"" During one part of the movie, a BTN producer of a news program, states, it's their job to report the news, and it is the job of the government to create the lies. Although, this movie is based on a comic series from the 1980s, it has striking parallels to modern issues and events through various allusions we can infer.

""V"" is the ultimate voice of reason. He was a victim of a covert government research project, which left him scarred--mentally and physically--for life, hence his vendetta against those who have wronged him. He is forced underground into a world where he is surrounded by the facts and reminders of the past. He completely understands the issues of life in England. His goal is to liberate all the people of England from the oppression they have so meekly given their Chancellor. He uses various methods to destroy the government from the inside by preying on a top Party official's paranoia, while then giving the people a tactile vision of what freedom and popular sentiment really means, by succeeding where Guy Fawkes failed on November 5, 1605. Yes, he blows up Parliament; thereby, symbolizing a striking defeat to tyranny and a new beginning for the masses of England toward democracy and self-determination.

In the end, ""government by the people"" is restored. ""V"" is deemed the patriot within all of us. Perhaps, ""V"" is the patriot in us as Americans. He envisioned a world without hate, a world returned to common sense, to rule by the people, from the hands of a dysfunctional, paranoid oligarchy.

7763656,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Let me preface my review by first saying that I am not familiar with the original graphic novel, so my review will be based on my reaction to the movie alone.

What I am most impressed by is the commentary that is quite naturally found in this movie.  The theme is quite old, but wonderfully universal--the abuse of power by the powerful to entrap the common and weak.  Because of that, the movie makes not very veiled references to George Orwell (by not only using John Hurt, who starred in the movie 1984, but to dress him up as Big Brother from that movie and have him appear, through most of the movie, on a large TV screen) and even George Bush (with a second-in-command that smacks of Dick Cheney).  Though the references seems a little cliche at times, they are quite effective.  This is the greatest strength of sci-fi--to investigate present times and comment upon them in a form that doesn't seem like political commentary.  This was the purest strength of The Matrix--a movie, essentially, about the removal of humanity from an electronic world, and how to become human once again THROUGH that technology instead of DESPITE it.

In this movie, we have an England that is run by a hard-edged morality that outlaws and bans what it doesn't like.  V, after a chance rescue of Evie (Natalie Portman), begins to induct her into his plan to free England, in much the same way as his idol Guy Fawkes attempted back in the 17th century.  But of course this time around, the stakes are higher, in that a mysterious biogenic weapon has created a lot of hysteria about terrorists and has given the government power to keep tabs on EVERYONE (sound familiar?).  Evie begins to investigate the truth of things, and everything unfolds from there.

Some criticisms of this movie have decried the close connections of V to actual terrorists, but V clearly has a purpose to bring society together rather than tear it apart.

Hugo Weaving, a brilliant actor (Mr. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.  And the idea of plans within plans falls through a little bit, leaving some confusing movements towards the end, but the extent of the conspiracies presented here will keep necessary arguments going on for years.  The plotline of V as somewhat superhuman didn't quite seem to fit into this movie--it would seem that he would have been just as effective as someone who hadn't been 'enhanced,' but perhaps this was an element of the graphic novel that held more purpose there.

In all, this was an excellent movie.  Exciting, action-packed and meaningful.  Great work.",1155772800,3,2590,4.745535714285714

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this, but I'll try. Easily the most breath-taking visuals I've seen since Sin City, and some of the best acting I've seen since Crash. Hugo Weaving as V is one of the coolest characters I can remember, and he plays it perfectly. I thought Natalie Portman was just awful in the Star Wars trilogy, in fact I really haven't liked much of anything she's done, but she absolutely nailed this, a crafty mix of innocent and troubled persona holding on to a disturbing secret and violent past.

The Wachowski Brothers and there protege' James McTeigue have created a masterpiece that I eagerly look forward to purchasing and watching many, many times. Bound to upset others, but I found this to be just as entertaining (if not more) as the Wachowski's 1st visual feast, The Matrix. I know that Alan Moore asked for his name to be removed from the production as he was upset over a few of the minor changes, but Mr. Moore, you have nothing to be ashamed of, you're novel has been transformed into the best movie of 2006, and you know what, I think I just might go watch it again right now, see ya!!!",1155772800,3,1911,5.288079470198675
7763658,2,B01GJQM5JM,"Man! This movie does make a lot of big statements on current world politics. In fact, it is one big political statement! It uses current hot buzz words like ""terrorism"" and ""national security."" It also makes references toward ""America's Iraq War."" I can see how Conservatives hate it, while Liberals love it, much like they would Rush Limbaugh or Bill Maher.

As an action movie or drama, I thought it sucked. I had the impression that the writers' message was more important than the story itself. Movies like ""American President"" entertain first and make political statements second. Not this one!

Artistic entertainment aside, if your Conservative, pass it up. It'll just hurt your feelings and tick you off. You're the bad guy in this movie (and I mean BAD).

If you're liberal, watch it. It'll make you feel good, since it's a movie about how evil Conservatives are. It's also about another Revolution to overthrow them.

I do suggest that if you do watch it, you should try to borrow a copy. No one should pay to watch a political advertisement or statement, whether it be from the right or left. Political ads should be shown for free!",1155686400,13,1143,4.757575757575758

If not, why would they view a film that portrays a government that does so as an attack to their moral codes? it just puzzles me. Come on, people, this film is great. The main character is the guy we were waiting for while reading 1984.... we just had to wait to see him in a different media, with a similar story.

The film in itself is well shot, mounted, and has a good pace. AND DOES NOT PORTRAY CATHOLICS AS EVIL!!!! Get real, we (catholics) don't go around killing any non-catholic, and, if we were, then we surely would be evil, don't you think?????",1155686400,5,694,4.37984496124031
7763661,5,B01GJQM5JM,"A co-worker loaned this to me and said it was a really good movie. So last Thursday, I sat down to watch it, not knowing what to expect and whether or not I would even like it.

I watched it 2 more times in the follwing 3 days.

This is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The not-too-subtle political statements are well said without being preachy. All the political angles have been covered ad nauseum. Suffice it to say, you will either love or hate it, depending on whether you are left or right of the center line.

All the actors were excellent, but Hugo Weaving's V stole the show. Despite being behind a mask for the entire movie, his body language was so expressive that the audience can't help but be drawn in to root for this ""guy"". His V is at once angry, bitter, vengeful, but also righteous, decent, gentlemanly and above all... tender.

Both Evey and V grow throughout the movie, each learning from the other that right and wrong is not so clear cut as they originally thought, eventually coming to the realization that they alone cannot make choices for anyone other than themselves.

Like all good love stories, this one is heart-breaking. The moment near the end, when Evey and V finally share a tender moment, Hugo Weaving's touching performance conveys the depth of the longing that V has for Evey. The audience can actually feel V's momentary indulgence, considering abandoning his plans for vengeance in favor of a life that he never thought he would have. It was just brilliant.

This is a must have for my collection.",1155600000,6,1569,4.546099290780142
7763662,4,B01GJQM5JM,"After anticipating this movie for so long, all of a sudden I found myself not wanting to watch it. I couldn't figure it out: was it the negative press, or the controversy, or the fact that I read the original graphic novel and wasn't that big of a fan of it? I still can't figure it out after watching it actually. It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love.

We're in an Orwellian ""1984""-esque England where the government controls everything, microphones and cameras are everywhere, religious texts are banned and dissenters often disappear. Leading the fight for freedom is V, a man in a mask inspired by Guy Fawkes who dons knives and takes down key members of government and plans to blow up Parliament. With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions.

Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize ""hey, we ARE getting screwed here!""

How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an action junkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a ""Mr. Anderson..."" at any moment.

Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.",1155600000,,2654,4.652452025586354
7763663,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendetta was certainly not what I expected. Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.

 V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.

 Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say ""republicans are evil bla bla bla"" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.

7763664,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Here is a spectacle that never fails to disappoint even in spite of certain imperfections.  Visually, it is flawless.  McTeigue certainly knows his craft and manages to use the camera in a manner that is perfectly befitting the content.  The production design is idiosyncratic but also accessible and believable, which further mesmerizes and intrigues.  The script by the Wachowskis further exemplifies their talent: they now how to use words, they know how to use ideas, they know how to build a story.

And what a story it is.  I was uncertain how to feel the first time I viewed the film.  Certainly, the movie must breed controversy, and I didn't know which side of that I fell on.  I've come to endorse the film but only after careful reflection.  The issues are contemporary and touchy, but the movie offers enough ambiguity to permit the viewer his own interpretation.  Certainly, one cannot mindlessly interact with this film; only catastrophe could ensue as a result.  Patience and contemplation are required here, and I fear that in the wrong hands, this form of content could be inflammatory.  But then all good art is.

There's nothing to complain about with Natalie Portman, but it's a sheer miracle that Hugo Weaving can continuously steel the show from behind a mask--what a voice!  Another component on which I must comment is the use of editing and music.  Dario Marianelli's score is superb, and listen to the way he subtly incorporates Tchaikovsky into the quieter moments!  Scattered throughout the film are several intriguing and wonderful montage sequences that create a marvelous flow to the narrative and are wonderfully accented by the pulse of Marianelli's music.  At times the film makes awkward pauses, the dialogue waxes melodramatic, and the pacing seems forced, but these faults are inconsequential to an overall brilliant film.",1155600000,4,1859,5.0625

I liked the way they updated it and I can't say that for many of the comic book films that I've seen.  However the DVD release has left me crying.  I mean on this over-priced double disc special edition we don't even get a commentary.  A lone fifteen minute featurette, that is absolutely worthless as they don't interview the Wachowski Bros or ALAN MOORE the author fills out the first disc weekly.  They talk to a bunch of real cool comic book insiders but they have no relevancy to either the story or the film.  The second disc made me weep.  There isn't a single interesting special feature on the DVD with the exception of when they talk about the real Guy Fawkes.  They have a little featurette on the Gun Powder Treason that is interesting and relevant to the film since most Americans have no idea who Guy was.  The rest of the features fall flat on their face and simply appear to take up space so that they could stick a second DVD into the package and charge a few extra bucks for poor saps like me that loved the film enought to simply jump at a double disc release with out looking long enough.  I would recommend grabbing the single disc edition unless you are a huge Natalie Portman fan because of the easter egg on the second disc.

this movie is about a corrupt government in the future. it is a government ruled by fear and oppression and the excessive need for conrtol and power on the government's power, under total control of the Chancellor Sutler. he's done everything possible to kill free thoughts and different people. everything from The Koran to same sex marriage has been banned and the mews networks are controlled by the government and they report false or biased opinions (not too unlike that of Fox News Network).

Theres a man named V who is a freethinker and the starter of this idea that is to change this government. he challenges all the ideas the government stands for. he meets Evey (natalie portman) by chance on the street, and they form a bond over the fact that the government is looking for her. he kills the people making the government corrupt and leaves the new ideas to different peoplem, who obviously want a change.

the ending is very good and i couldn't have asked for one better. there are ideas expressed in the movie... maybe subliminally, maybe not so hidden...about whats to come of the world as a result of this war America is in or have started. its a very very good movie that poses plenty of questions for you to ponder. it sux that i had to wait to come to DVD because my local movie theater wouldn't get it. and thats exactly the reasoning that gets us to the government in this movie.  go rent this.",1155600000,2,1608,4.572916666666667

People who don't care about the current state of political affairs should enjoy this movie despite its rather slow pace and drawn out dialoge.  Good performances are provided by all, the directing is solid, and the action scenes, few that they are, are quite effective. The references to America crumbling under its policies of recent years, however, will make many uncomfortable.  At times the film feels like a left-wing fantasy of where they believe we are headed (with references to Nazi-ism and fascism), other times it just seems like an attack on Conservative ideas (mainly regarding the war on terror).  Two things to keep in mind;  Alan Moore, who wrote the original graphic novel, demanded his name be taken off this movie completely, and that it's fairly obvious a bold political statement is being made with this film.  You may applaude it or you may loathe it, depending on your views.  My opinion is that politics should be left out of comic hero/action flicks.

7763671,2,B01GJQM5JM,"This film was based on a graphic novel (comic book) of the same name from the eighties. Apparently the brothers didn't feel the need to ""dress-it-up"" a little for the big screen. The whole movie ends up feeling like, well, a comic book. But not in a cool Matrix or Underworld kind of way, where you have characters that are so far removed from reality. Just in a kind of cheesy, one dimensional way.

It was hard to take this film seriously with its clichd version of the big, evil government run amok. The big brother menace that was scary 2 decades ago feels fairly dated here. Due in part to lack of realism in the set decoration as well as the portrayal of the periods technology. I just can't buy that in an age of movies-on-demand, Tivo, pay-per-view, and hundreds of satellite and cable channels at our disposal, society progresses into a group of sheep-like morons that believe everything that is fed to them from the ominous government via one single TV station. Where is the internet? Once again, the graphic novel is now dated in its ideas and the movie makes no attempt to adapt to the ideology of the present day. This only works when filming period pieces.

This movie would have worked very well in the early eighties. It's just hard to swallow in today's world.

The acting was decent but shouldn't we expect that? No award winning performances.

All-in-all? Nothing special. The whole project felt like a big inside joke. To elaborate; I'm sure this was something dear to the Warchowski Brother's hearts and I'm sure all their nerdy friends who loved the graphic novel thought this was a great idea. However, it should have been updated, expanded upon and modernized to entertain the people who paid to see it but didn't already have fond teenage memories of the once groundbreaking comic.

7763672,3,B01GJQM5JM,"I'm not going to re-iterate who was in the movie, or re-hash the story...you can read the other reviews for that. I am here to tell my opinion on the whole situation regarding V for Vendetta.

Great message. Freedom is a must, and people do have to care to make a change. We have to shake ourselves out of complacency and indifference to make change. We must think for ourselves and regain our humanity.

I also agree that the movie is taking a stab at our government, which is neither good nor bad. It is what it is.

I am here to just review the art.

The story of V for Vendetta is so over-played and over-done, it is just plain annoying. The drama inherent within the movie is cheesy and the whole FREEDOM thing is done out of proportion. Like another reviewer stated, this movie as about revenge, not freedom. There is no freedom in revenge, revenge is another emotion that holds you captive, just like indifference. Therefore, I felt that the message of the movie was largly inconsistant. And throwing in Shakespearian quotes does not make the movie any better.

The dialogue is horrible, and the action sequences are yawn inducing. Bullet-time is used again(!) but this time knifes replace bullets.

What's the message of the film? Freedom or violence to reach freedom? Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the fact that they used violence to gain freedom in the movie, I just think that many misguided people will take this movie as true and think violence will ""free"" them from their ""oppression"".

The writer and directors seem to have executed certain parts to tug at the heart strings of the audience, which failed misrably in my opinion. The writer tries to make a sentimental moment out of every scene, and it just doesn't work.

Largly un-original concepts and over-done plot make this a very weak movie that too many people think too highly of, Probably because everyone loves to bash Mr. Bush and America, even if they have no clue as to why they are doing it. But hey, everyone else is:)

Don't get me wrong, I am just as anti-anti freedom as any other lover of freedom and humantiy, but just because a movie features action and some guy fighting for freedom, does not make it a great movie.

Decent film, worth renting. Provides a nice release to rebel-wannabes who are too afraid to help make change and would rather dream about it, a large reason why things are the way they are:)",1155427200,2,2400,4.586448598130841
7763673,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The neocon reviewers don't get it. This is not a movie about the US goverment today. They hate this movie because it shows where this goverment is leading us. ""V"" is a true hero because the goverment he fights is unambiguously evil. We are not there, yet. This movie is merely a warning. It asks us to ""look ourselves in the mirror"" and not let our fears override our values. The dangers we face from terrorists are real, but also the fear mongering and deception of this goverment are real. That's the only way to explain how something as un-american and un-patriotic as the ""Patriot Act"" (""Articles of Allegiance"" in the movie) can get that name and be accepted by the citizens of our country. We as a nation are sure to face new attacks from terrorists, but we should never renounce our liberty for the sake of security.  As Benjamin Franklin said: ""He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither"". Maybe the intentions of the neocons are good, but ""I'm not here for what you hoped for, I'm here for what you did"".

++Spoiler Warning++

The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous. In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropiate and actually enjoyable. ""V"" is a flawed hero, driven more by the desire for vengance than by ideals, but idealistic never the less. He realizes his shortcomings; he has became a monster and tells Evey as much in the climactic scene: ""You are right about what I've become, there is no tree at the end for me"". In other words, there can be no happy ending for ""V"", no tree to climb with his love like Edmund Dantes. The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent.  In the end with the announced destruction of Parliment ""V"" just gives the people the opportunity to lose their fear of the goverment and reclaim their freedom. It still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take it back.

7763675,2,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.

The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.

The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.

The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.

I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.

If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.

7763676,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The brilliant Hugo Weaving excels and Natalie Portman redeems herself (Princess Amidala, anyone?) in this all-too-relevant film.  This film deals with many of the issues relevant to politics today and brilliantly skewers many characters who will seem very familiar from current events - politicians who exploit fear, blowhard talk-show hosts etc.  Set in England after the demise of the US as a superpower, the film deftly refers to current political events as background to the rise of totalitarianism and ethnic cleansing.  The central theme of the film is the trading of civil liberties for security, and the difficulty of undoing such a pact once it has been made.

The film also tackles many ethical issues such as vengeance and torture with what may be for some people uncomfortable conclusions.

Much has been written about Alan Moore (the original author) removing his name from the credits of the film, a decision which was based on the Wachowski Brothers (of Matrix fame) departing from the original text in their efforts to update it.  However, the Wachowski's have created a masterpiece that adheres to the spirit of the original book whilst holding up a mirror to contemporary politics.  Most importantly, the character of V (dandy, intellectual, mysterious) is largely untampered with.

Unsurprisingly for a film that is based on a comic book/graphic novel, the main characters almost border on archetypes, and this lends an appropriately comic-book feel to the film, and in this respect although it has no animation it has some similarity to films like Sin City.

The plot centers around the interaction of Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey.  Carefully-placed reveals allows us insight into the events that (literally) moulded V's worldview and show his conversion of Evey from timid obedientarian to revolutionary.  Of particular note is Hugo Weavings ability to emote from behind a glossy, permanently-grinning mask.  The mask (and I am not going to give any spoilers here) is of a character called Guy Fawkes, a would-be revolutionary who long ago was foiled in his attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in England.

Natalie Portman gives a convincing portrayal of the personal journey that Evey is persuaded to undertake, and John Hurt excels as the megalomaniacal Chancellor Sutler.  All similarities between Hurt's Sutler and Adolf Hitler are of course completely intentional, as are the ruling party's insignia and oppressive behaviour both of which have definite Third Reich similarities.  Hurt's performance would seem over the top if it were not for the fact that we regularly see the same hate-spewing histrionics from political pundits and talking heads.  I would guess that Hurt modeled his performance on talk-show hosts every bit as much as the crack-pot dictators of the Second World War.  It is no accident that when Hurt addresses the public, or even his political allies in private, he does so over a giant TV monitor.

To call the supporting cast excellent would be an understatement.  Of particular note is Rupert Graves' brilliant portrayal of Dominic, the 'Voice Of London', a twisted, hate-filled talking head whose concentration-camp crimes are rewarded by a cushy job spewing vitriol over the airwaves on the government-controlled TV channel, a man so in love with his own persona that he even rants along to recordings of his own shows whilst in the shower.  His diatribes are punctuated with catch-phrases such as ""I'm a God-fearing Englishman!"" and ""England Prevails!"".  Also notable is Stephen Rea's portrayal of the beaten-down Inspector Finch, a man who has risen in the ruling party despite his not-quite-ethnically-pure family background and whose disillusionment with the party enables him to play a defining role in the plans of V and Evey.

Perhaps inevitably, despite providing the catalyst for societal change, V is ultimately consumed by his vengeance.

This film is not afraid to take on issues that many vendors of popular culture would shy away from, and that inevitably will invite criticism.  However as the poet Hardy once said ""If way to the better there be, it exacts a full look at the worst"".  If you haven't already seen this film, get yourself a copy.",1155340800,133,4236,5.131004366812227

I don't know how or where, but you found it.

For the rest of us, it was a good movie, especially if you prefer movies that aren't all car chases, gunfights, and scantily clad teenage girls.  There was an action element to it, of course, but mostly this was a movie that made one think about the power of words, of ideas, of freedom.  If you're into ""thrill a minute"" movies, keep going.

7763678,3,B01GJQM5JM,"The Wachowski Brothers, of ""Matrix"" fame, adapted ""V for Vendetta"" from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, moving the action further into a dystopian future where Great Britain has exchanged obedient consent to totalitarian rule for order and peace in a world beset by violence and chaos. A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself ""V"" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).

Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found ""V for Vendetta"" mostly tedious and generally bland. ""V"" could as easily stand for ""verbose"" as ""vendetta"". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but ""V for Vendetta"" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.

Much has been made of the idea that ""V for Vendetta"" casts a ""terrorist"" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So ""V for Vendetta"" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see ""The Battle of Algiers"", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. ""V for Vendetta"" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is ""Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta"" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving. They discuss the film's themes and some aspects of adapting the movie from the graphic novel. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.

7763679,1,B01GJQM5JM,"The are many good things about the movie, but for me, they were overshadowed by the politics.

Is the government in ""V"" really a government sort of like our own?  ...a government which controls our minds and uses invasive laws to threaten our freedoms?

Those who have a profoundly negative view of modern societies, sympathize largely with anarchists, and enjoyed seeing the White House blow up in ""Independence Day"" may enjoy this film.  But if you see the positive things that western society has accomplished, if you sense that history has been steadily moving in the direction of progress, education, and increasing freedom and prosperity for citizens of 1st World nations (and most others as well), then this movie's prescription for social change through terrorism may seem alarming to you.

I was unable to enjoy Vendetta because I feel that it is trying to level undeserved criticism on Western Governments and Liberal Democracy.  The Government in ""V"" is meant, it seems, to be a caricature of the U.S. government...though I find the two hardly similar.

Still, I have many friends who see the U.S. government as somewhat like the government depicted in this movie.  They're paranoid about government conspiracies, and if you feel the same way, you may get a kick out of this movie...but I implore you to consider the differences between western governments and the governments that usually oppose them and I hope you will ask yourself which governments the totalitarian state in ""Vendetta"" really resembles.  I feel that any fair interpretation will find the governments of the West to be far freer, but that's me.

********************************
other thoughts

I think about who might enjoy a movie like this, and this comes to mind:

Anti-social people
Timothy McVeigh
Tim Treadwell (The subject of ""Grizzly Man"")
Osama Bin Laden

There are many who, unhappy with modern society, can see only the destruction of it as a remedy.  I see this as frightening and incoherent.

What would Martin Luther King Jr. think of this perspective?  What would Gandhi think?  ...and Jesus?

Frightening because those who end up doing horrible violent things: Osama Bin Laden, the Columbine Killers, McVeigh...have rationalized their actions along similar logical lines: the oppressing powers are evil, so that justifies any response.
But what if people die in the blown up buildings?  What if the act doesn't actually accomplish anything?  What if the murder of all these people is based on political opinions that not everyone agrees with?  Why should people die because some turkey has an opinion?

Usually criticisms of the West are based on the opinion that life was better before modern society, or that we had more freedoms once...or that our prosperity is hurting the world...or that life is getting worse and worse...

But there are many, many, many people who disagree with this point of view.

It is my opinion that this movie advocates violence that no good can come of.  Many many people may disagree with me.  They have that right, but they do not have the right, to blow me up.",1155254400,61,3091,5.011764705882353
7763680,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This film is a sleeper. I don't know why, when it came out, it was not acclaimed by the critics. As I recall, folks claimed that it was too ""heady"", and tried to drive its themes down the viewer's throat a bit too enthusiastically.

However, I found the film fascinating, as much for the changes from the graphic novel as for the care taken in its filming, casting, and cinematography. This film is one that will resonate with viewers for a long time after they've watched it. And, unlike the graphic novel, this one ends less ambiguously and with much less angst and more hope.

I really can't go into detail on what I liked and why...I just recommend it wholeheartedly. It's violent, but the violence is very stylized, such that even those who are squeamish aren't likely to be as disturbed by the bloodshed as they might be the images of Lark Hill.... But even these are not gratuitously violent.

Definitely five stars. Haven't enjoyed a film like this in years!",1155254400,3,966,4.604651162790698

Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.

I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.

John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.

Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.

The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.

The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.

One can see what this film aspires to be--it contains obvious references to Michael Radford's adaptation of Orwell's 1984, David Fincher's adaptation of Palahniuk's FIGHT CLUB, and the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX--but it falls flat. 1984 provides us Winston Smith to win our empathy and pity. FIGHT CLUB suggests that the populace would develop a movement driven by passion. THE MATRIX offers a simple story but an innovative, visually riveting form of storytelling. The film V FOR VENDETTA glosses over the confusing dynamics of the relationship between V and Evey (Stockholm syndrome? love? brainwashing?), replaces activism with costuming, and lacks the visual verve one would expect from a Wachowski production. I should note that the masked Hugo Weaving performs impressively, given his reliance on his voice and postures to convey feeling, but the fine cast cannot save this muddled production.

7763683,4,B01GJQM5JM,"V for Vendatta is a movie about terrorism, anarchism, vigilantes, corrupt governments, trading false security for liberty and many other politically charged ideas.

The cinematography and acting are wonderful. The political messages are ultimately polarizing and confusing.

The film tells the story of V, a man who has been tortured and experimented on by a near future totalitarian and corrupt British government. V is a superhero or supercriminal, depending on your perspective. He's really both. Was his soul stolen by the government or did he lose it wreaking his revenge throughout the course of the film?

All of the main performers are over the top. V's prose throughout the film is wonderfully spellbinding. I found myself alternately loving and hating this man.

Many of the political issues addressed by the film are very valid. Americans and Europeans are in the process of trading basic liberties for a false sense of security. Just ask anyone who has flown on a commerical flight recently how free they felt during the in-processing.

However, the imagery and ideas presented in V for Vendetta are over the top and the problem solving methods used by V pure fantasy.

The movie is nevertheless highly enjoyable. The important message contained within is that complacency is the recipe for loss of liberty. Interwoven throughout the movie are several love stories.

7763685,4,B01GJQM5JM,"I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but at least it took some chances. The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood these days. However, it does seem obvious that the movie is taking swipes at the Bush administration and its supporters, which is not exactly a brave or bold position in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.

The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.

I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.

7763687,3,B01GJQM5JM,"So many good things about the movie, but since my opinion is original only in its understanding of politics, let me be brief and to the point.

1) The message here, both in timing and design, seems clearly to be a stab at U.S. middle east foreign policy...and as misguided as that policy may be, the U.S. regime is neither terrorist nor totalitarian, and ME terrorists the likes of Al Qaeda and Hezbollah cannot claim a legitimate grievance in the manner that V does in this movie.  V is blaming his own government.  Middle East terrorists blame someone else's government, despite the fact that their own governments are the ones mostly responsible for their problems.

2) In a time when the world is consumed by hatred, the answer is peace, not violence.  Infrastructure, not war.

3) To suggest that blowing up a building is an appropriate way to make a political statement is dangerously irressponsible in the aftermath of 9/11, unless, or course, we're talking about Osama Bin Laden's house, or better yet, the imperial palace in Saudi Arabia.  Dictators, who block the economic growth of their countries, expel foreign aid workers, confiscate UN food aid, create a state-run media of hate, and waste precious resources on palaces and weapons, these are the guys we need to be taking a scrutinizing look at. They're the ones who are keeping their countries and citizens 200 years behind the rest of the world languishing in the archaic ideologies and conditions that breed terrorism, violence, and war.

Okay, so I'm not being brief...

THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT EXPLAINED

Why V for Vendetta misses the mark:

For the reasonable and the informed, a piece that plays metaphor with the U.S. and Israel and likens them to terrorist nations (such as the kind we are familiar with in Orwellian fiction) does such a disservice to the truth as to make itself into a menace and impediment to intelligent thought.

This is because the U.S. and Israel are more like victims than aggressors, and are therefor more similar to V than to the totalitarian state which is supposed to represent them.

1000 years of genocidal racism gave way to the state of Israel in 1948.  Israel is V.  The cultural reaction throughout the Middle East has been the same as it might have been had a group of Mississippian Blacks suddenly formed their own nation in 1950s America.  White America would've invaded and eliminated the threat.  But let's say for a moment that the U.S. was unable to do this.  This is the situation we find in the Middle East in 1948; a system of entrenched racism and beliefs of cultural superiority are challenged when a small minority repulses the genocidally motivated aggression of a seemingly more powerful majority.  Check your history!  (In the Middle East caste system, Jews had no rights, and were called ""Dhimmi"" citizens) Then, the majority, as they might have done to blacks in America, responds with a backlash against Jews throughout the Middle East.  A million Jews are expelled from their homes, their property confiscated...they flee to Israel.  At the same time, roughly the same number of Arab Muslims (700,000) are expelled from the Israeli occupied territories.  Here we come upon the defining moment of the Middle East conflict: Israel absorbs a million Jewish refugees, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria keep the 700,000 Muslim refugees in camps for political reasons (to incite anger against Israel) where they languish until they are finally renamed and reborn: they become Palestinians.  Imagine that the blacks won in our fictional Mississippian Revolution, and expelled the whites.  What if those whites were never allowed to rejoin white society?  What if they were kept in refugee camps for generations?  What emotions would guide their actions?  What would they think of the blacks in Mississippi?  What would they think of the whites who had forsaken them?  How would they view the white regime(s) that were manufacturing/using their plight for political gain?

Here we have seen the real nature of the conflict in the Middle East.  A conflict created by Middle East leaders for political gain, to open a gulf of hatred between the East and the West, which can never be filled by violence, but only by empathy, understanding, modernization, prosperity, and the building of infrastructure.  The impediment to this progress being the governments of the Middle East nations themselves.",1155081600,10,4406,4.98358413132695

All I knew was that it starred Hugo Weaving in a weird mask and Natalie Portman with a shaved head. I was expecting an action/adventure movie in the same category as Zorro, but what I got was much, much more.

Oh yes, there is plenty of action and adventure as the mysterious V slashes his way through the elite of London society, but to look at the movie only as an action flick is to miss the entire point-- the movie is the story of what happens in a totalitarian society when the government becomes too suspicious of the people. There's enough political relevance in the film to make some people today very uncomfortable.

There are so many levels on which this movie can be watched-- it is very violent so parents of young children should be advised, but it is also a tender love story and a story of strength and courage and what happens when one stands firm in one's beliefs. I do know that the 1812 Overture will never sound the same to me again, and that the 5th of November will now have a different meaning in my life-- this is a life changing movie and a life affirming movie. For that may indeed by V's ultimate point-- life is too short not to live it thoroughly and without fear.",1155081600,7,1311,4.346938775510204
7763690,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Wow! This is a terrific movie, a parable of future history from a liberal viewpoint. Warning- some people may find the movie offensive to their religious and/or political beliefs.

However, the movie is the telling of how ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" With an incredibly strong performance by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea, the movie tells of a fascist society that is shaken when a character known only as V blows up the Old Bailey Courthouse while the 1812 Overture plays loudly on the loudspeakers placed throughout the streets of London. Evey (Natalie Portman) is a naf that V (Hugo Weaving) rescues from the guards when they are about to arrest her for violating curfew. Stephen Rea is the police inspector charged with tracking V, and as he trudges through his investigation, his faith in the government and his superiors is destroyed.

V and Evey are drawn to each other while Evie is at the same time repelled by him. After he commits a murderous raid on the TV station where Evey works, she saves him from being arrested. He takes her to his hidden bunker and refuses to let her leave. He continues his murderous spree and Evey, in the course of helping him with one of the murders, escapes from him. However, she is soon taken prisoner by the police and tortured while undergoing interrogation about V's whereabouts.

The end of the movie is truly stirring and brings to mind the revolutionary march scene from Les Miserables. The earlier scenes between Evey and V are very reminiscent of The Phantom of the Opera, although Evey never does see underneath V's mask. She doesn't need to because by the end of the movie she, and we, learn exactly who V is in a scene that is surely one of the great scenes of movie history.

This is not a movie for young children due to scenes of graphic, realistic violence. However, people who are resistant to viewing the movie because it is produced by the same people who produced the Matrix or because they don't like Science Fiction movies or Super Hero movies can put those reservations aside.

7763694,5,B01GJQM5JM,"For me V for Vendetta was the best movie of 2005.  I saw it in the theater on the recommendation of a friend, and ordered the DVD as soon as it was available to pre-order on Amazon.  I've already seen it three times and I look forward to seeing it again.

I purchased the two disc special edition version, and I cannot say in all honesty that the second disc is all that thrilling.  I would not go out of my way to pay extra for it.

As far as the movie goes it is powerful and thought provoking.  A timely reminder that a government should be subservient to the people and not the other way around.  There is plenty of action, some great dialogue, some wonderful scenes.  It's just a damn good movie.  There are already a few hundred other reviews detailing the plot and the background to the movie.  Suffice to say this is a good one, and should be on your must see list.",1154908800,2,873,4.173652694610778
7763695,5,B01GJQM5JM,"It's not often I'm completely blown away by a new film. But at the insistance of a close friend, I watched this with him the night it came out on DVD and I was floored. I can't remember the last time I had such an emotional reaction to a film.

Many insightful things have already been said about 'V' by other reviewers, so I will try to keep this brief for the sake of not retreading what they've already said. First, the characterization in this film is nothing short of brilliant. The script is fantastic and they chose the right actors/actresses for the right rolls. You will believe you know these characters yourself when the film is through.

The production team pulled no punches on the visuals. Over 80 full-scale sets with minute attention to detail, beautifully realistic model-based special effects as opposed to thinly veiled CGI as is the common practice in hollywood nowadays... it's all there. Not only that, but the soundtrack is gorgeous. The orchestral themes are memorable, the use of secondary tunes appropriate and unobtrusive. The soundtrack goes so far towards moving the plot emotionally.

Most importantly, the story is rich and multi-faceted in a way that I was not expecting. There is layer upon layer of storyline elements, points, general brainfood, call them what you will... when you add the superb (and highly emotional) character development as well as its historical allusions to November the fifth and Guy Fawkes, you get a film that is massive in scale.

Quickly before I wrap this review up, I would like to address a few specific things. Mainly, I think anyone who complains about the slightly unfaithful adaptation of the graphic novel is missing the point and depriving themselves of some of what this film has to offer as a separate body of work. Given the medium, this adaptation is about as good as it could have been. The changes to the story do not affect the quality at all. The convoluted maze of plot details now native to the graphic novel are beyond the scope of a mere two hour roll of celluloid (not to mention some of them might have dulled the delivery of the film considerably, IE the ""Fate"" computer.) Personally I'm relieved they chose overall quality over 100% accuracy.

Lastly, I am reviewing the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD because it is the edition I purchased, but it is not really necessary. The special features are interesting but are not very long and you may not find it worth the extra four bucks. I prefer the artwork though and it does come with a hilarious (although hidden) SNL skit featuring Natalie Portman.

This movie is worth an immediate purchase. Number one of the year so far and a contender for my personal top five. It's subversive and some people may find it uncomfortable, but it is undoubtedly of the highest quality filmmaking. Completely worth your money and the time you'll spend obsessing about it after you watch it for the first time.",1154908800,7,2928,4.765285996055227
7763696,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Any movie with Jan van Eyck's Arnofini Marriage in it has an A in my book, but this film is a truly awe-inspiring combination of creative plot, great casting/characters, and phenomenal special effects.  Very moving yet funny and real.  Watching it puts you in the action and gets your pulse AND your brain going.  The best movie I've seen in years.",1154908800,4,348,4.672131147540983
7763697,4,B01GJQM5JM,"The film V for Vendetta is a visually stunning film portrayal of a man bent on vengence against those who tormented him personally and who have oppressed his country.  It is not so much a film of ideas as it is of visual effect.  Like the film Sin City which also brought to life characters in a graphic novel, the visuals in this film are striking and are to a certain extent, a large part of the story.  To elaborate, the film lacks a set of clearly defined ideas beyond the vengence that V wishes to carry out.  For example, he blows up the Old Bailey at midnight, when there is very little chance of anyone being injured or killed.  He plans to blow up Parliment one year later, but his pre-announcement of the plan to the authorities ensures that the government will not be brought down, precisely the opposite of the character he emulates, Guy Fawkes.  This coupled with his personal vendetta against those who used him in medical experiments contributes to a dearth of ideas driving the story.  In real historical terms, the story is a closer parallel to the French Revolution than the American Revolution, where the French people extracted revenge against the nobility and had no plan for a government beyond the revenge.  The American Revolution was more a revolution in ideas regarding government and the right of the colonies to determine their own future.  The main insight to the ideas driving V's actions comes in the television broadcast he makes to the nation.

So we must suspend our judgement here and concentrate on the visual impact, which is striking.  I picked up on two interesting cinematic parallels.  The first is the ""1984"" parallel, the movie in which John Hurt, who played the High Chancellor, played Winston Smith.  The logo for 1984 included a large V as the symbol for the Party of Big Brother.  In this movie V is the symbol of the rebellion.  In both films, government is sustained through lies and a focus on enemies, real and imagined.  The second cinematic parallel is ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  In both movies a masked antihero imprisons a young woman in order to capture her heart and mind, with a repressed love interest between the two protagonists.  The symbol of the antihero in both movies is a single red rose.  The visual impact of the movie recalls the ""film noir"" genre of the 1940's and 1950's, with shadowy lighting, rain, and heroes of questionable nobility.

I thought the acting was well done.  Natalie Portman goes well beyond her wooden portrayals as Amidala in the Star Wars trilogy as a woman torn between her desire to avoid the violent end her parents met and the magnetic personality of V.  Hugo Weaving plays a masterful part as V, especially since wearing the mask prevents the use of his face in portraying the intensity of his emotion and the ideas driving his revenge.  Insightful dialogue provides the window to the man behind the mask.  The other actors flesh out the case with standouts being John Hurt as the High Chancellor and Stephen Rea as the detective trying to bring V to justice.

In spite of the fact that this movie offers few profound ideas, it is great entertainment and kept me riveted to the screen from the beginning to the end.  My only wish is that the DVD offered more extras.  However, Hollywood has already come out with a Special Edition 2 disc set which I am sure will offer more features to the viewer.  For that reason, I only awarded four stars to this DVD.",1154908800,4,3453,4.634868421052632
7763698,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Okay, I'll make this short.  Once again, the Wachowski brothers have done it.  V for Vendetta is a very powerful film.  Without losing an inescapable sense of reality, the creators of the Matrix have managed to bring to the screen a futuristic world that leaves audiences thinking.

As a summary, V for Vendetta tells the story of pretty Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman trying to stay inconspicuous in the frightening London of the future.  However, during a late-night, dark-alley attack, she is saved by V, a masked terrorist that, for some reason, intrigues her.  When V blows up ""The Bailey"", a building in the heart of London, later that night, the government's police forces suspect Evey to have been privy to the plot.  Later, V holds the most-watched and government-sanctioned television network (called BTC) hostage and addresses the nation.  He asks England's citizens to rally against their corrupt government on the next November the 5th.  During the months preceding November the 5th, Evey becomes enmeshed in V's plans and the conspiracies and corruption of the government.  As the film progresses, the audience becomes increasingly aware of V's dark past and the secret that has brought the government to power and which it will kill to keep.

I am sure that other reviewers will say that this movie sanctions terrorism.  V for Vendetta, however, is a powerful film simply because it makes the audience think about terrorism and our world on a completely different level.  The scary part about this movie is that V and Evey's world does not seem so detached from our own.  It has a certain and eerie that-could-actually-happen quality.

This is one of the first movies that I have seen in a long time that made me reflect so much on real-world issues.  V for Vendetta is a sci-fi-esque thriller with a connection to today's world.",1154908800,6,1859,4.929260450160772
7763699,4,B01GJQM5JM,"...I actually liked this movie. There are changes. Changes in comic book story from the original material to movies happen way too much in Hollywood for my tastes but they happen. Why movie execs can't trust the decisions made by writers in other mediums is beyond me...

Still, V shines through. I liked the beefed-up character of Evey. Natalie did a great job. Her acting was spot-on! Sometimes the visuals were amazing. Sometimes they were too Matrix for my taste. The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask. Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea. John Hurt was truly frightening as the Chancellor.

There were some things I would like to have seen from Graphic Novel. I would like to have seen the train scene in the beginning and I think it would have been better if they had kept in that a computer was basically running the government. Also, I wish they had gone into Finch's transformation at Larkhill a little more. There was more character development in the graphic novel.

Things I'd wish they'd not had in the movie: too much of a love story between V and Evey. The end seen with the Fingermen and V was too Matrix and too Crow! And too gory. Blood was on a minimum through the whole movie (and I'm complaining here because I'm squeamish - far from it) and then you get to the fight between the Fingermen and V and there's blood flying out in great splashes. It was uneven with the rest of the movie.

Overall, I liked the movie. It was solid, entertaining, and well executed. It didn't make me think as much as Allan Moore's graphic novel did. But then the day that Hollywood realizes that comic books can be great source material for more than just action/adventure movies... well, that will be a revolution!",1154908800,4,1842,4.572727272727272
7763700,5,B01GJQM5JM,"The most important thing about the movie is that all you need to know is in it.  You just have to be able to sort it out to understand it.

Do we praise the character 'V' for his actions?  Would we cheer for the actions of a real person who takes such measures?  And would our answers be different if our government controlled the media and launched terror against our own citizens?  Would we be willing to stand against our government if it did?  I tend to think these questions are the ones that the movie makers want us to ponder upon.  They've succeeded quite well, from my point of view.  Mind you, its not a direct adaptation from the graphic novel.

The extras are very good on the disks.

7763702,5,B01GJQM5JM,"V For Vendetta is one of the best movies of our time. I'll admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but I don't think that should take away from this film. It's simply brilliant. The idea of a totalitarian government controlling every aspect of people's lives really makes one think of what it really means to be free. The acting is wonderful, with Hugo Weaving perfectly portraying the suave yet menacing character of V. His silky voice and charismatic words make one forget that he is, in fact, a terrorist with the intention of carrying out Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to destroy Parliament in the 1600's. Natalie Portman is great in her role of Evey Hammond, evolving from a cautious everyday woman trying to live her life in peace to a strong-willed woman who learns to overcome her fear. She isn't like most of the female leads in movies like this where she's only a victim caught in the middle of everything. And let's not forget Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, the skeptical yet determined officer trying to follow V before his threatened attack on Parliament on the 5th of November. The side stories are very interesting and piece the whole plot together in a web of illusioned coincidence. Never before has a movie given me chills the way V For Vendetta did at the very end, and I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it. Overall, it's perfect for those with an open mind who are looking for something very deep, thought-provoking, and moving.",1154822400,2,1469,4.632183908045977
7763703,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created ""V for Vendetta"" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.

Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie ""1984,"" and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.

Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.

Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.

The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.

The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.

Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.

One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.

If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.

If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.  Enjoy!",1154822400,3,4198,4.5595716198125835
7763704,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I have to agree with a lot of what has been said about the film. The film left me wanting to know more about the man.  Being disfigured beneath the mask; I still wanted to see the face of the man.  What type of life did he lead before this?  What was his job? What made him want to act? These are all unanswered questions that make the movie less.  I didn't read the graphic novel.  I intend to if it answers any questions the film didn't.

I would have liked to have seen the Wachovski's first pass at the script.  It might have provided more answers than this final version.  It was a great film but I have to wonder if any of the best parts were left on the cutting room floor.....",1154822400,2,684,4.052238805970149

The storyline is just brilliant. It really makes you think about politics and the government that exist in the real world as well as the media.

However, if all you see in V is a terrorist then I think you've missed the point of the film, because there is also a strong undercurrent of patriotism throughout.  V for Vendetta is set in a not-so-distant future that looks dusturbingly like a future that could easily be formed out of real-life current events.  In this future the government  has taken away basic civil liberties in the name of national security; government policies are based on fanatical religious doctine; and those who are different (gays and lesbians) are vilified and blamed for the ills of the world.  Sounds familiar, anyone?  This was also a well-cast film.  Hugo Weaving is simply great as V; and even though you never get to see his face, Weaving is able to convey real emotional strength.  Weaving is a very under-valued actor.  Natlie Portman was also great as Evey, the shy girl who comes around to V's thinking.  It says something about this film that when the final, horrific scene happens you find yourself cheered and excited.

7763708,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This film for me was Sheer Entertainment and needs to be watched at least once, if not more than once a political thriller with all the elements.

This Film is based on the Graphic novel V for Vendetta, written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd. The Novel has a comic adult sophistication with an amazing piece of full literature. But I will say if you've read the novel before watching this film get the book out of your head.

V for Vendetta is set in London, Britain in the near-future has been through a nuclear war, an extreme fascist party has arisen called Norefire. This New Fascist Government in the year 2020 holds England in an Iron grip through fear and Propaganda. V who projects himself as Guy Fawkes in this film (Guy Fawkes goes down in English History as a revolutionary who plotted to blow up Parliament with gunpowder in 1605) In this film V is shown in different ways a terrorist to some, a freedom fighter to others, an Anarchist, a Monster, who has ideals. V had been imprisoned, tortured extreme, physical and mentally abused, after surviving he thinks he can bring about great ideas and change in society but on the other hand he has a vengeful vendetta to get back at what society has done to him, a very dark and complex character. V uses his thread of elaborate, theatrical, violence to bring down the government. Will he succeed?

Well done to James Mcteigue who used lighting and angles to give the V mask layers of emotion.  Many serious issues weave through this film that makes you watch this wide eyed, and then out of the blue it lightens and pulls you into its comical/ironic side, it grabs attention, although this is based on a fictional world, fascism portrayed in this film is not far off the mark. Best Film I've seen for a long time. Outstanding cast.

7763709,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Let me first start by saying that i REALLY WANTED TO HATE THIS MOVIE, when i first heard the title, i thought it somewhat weak, then i saw the protagonist hero wore a clown-like mask while fighting evil, which sorry to say really didn't help win me over, and when i heard that the Wachowski Brother's helped put the movie together, my opinion was complete(I'm still boiling over their final installment of the Matrix Trilogy which i enjoyed about as much as inflamed genital boils).

However, despite my prejudgment,i must confess this movie is a triumph. Its almost like taking Batman and putting him in a Shakespearean modern conceptualization of George Orwell's 1984.

Simply put, the story is a romanticized view of a lone hero set out toward opening the minds of his fellow English brothers and sisters oppressed by a fascist government gone crazy. Although she gets top billing, Natlie Portman provides nothing more than a pretty face and limited acting skills as the sometimes unwilling disciple of V, the blade wielding, eclectic,(possibly sociopathic) protagonist (played by Hugo Weaving, AKA..Mr. Smith from the Matrix trilogy) who more than adequately makes up for Ms. Portmans terribly limited acting skills (sweety you had your five minutes of fame in Star Wars, take it, and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU).

The most interesting aspect of the movie, was in how realistic the future painted is, to the life and society we live in today.

If you play close attention you will see how the insane fascist dictator seems vaguely familiar to a certain American leader who like in the movie is against homosexuality, has ostracized his nation from the rest of the world, and uses continuous fear to keep his country in line (i.e. 9/11, Bird flu, Axis of evil, and the continuous war on terror)....... but i digress.. no point in beating around the er..um.. BUSH.

Another point that should be mentioned is the groundbreaking aspect this movie sets in regards to many action flicks in that it doesn't hold its own on fancy special effect, but on simply an intelligent smart story(sadly a rarity in many action films these days). The weak points i figure can only be seen in that I would have liked to have seen V in more fighting scenes, and the fascist dictators demise at the end seemed a tad anti climatic (sorry for the spoiler). So if you're like me dispel any first rush assumptions you might have had. This movie leaves you with the same message the first MATRIX movie (another triumph by the way) left many with........FREE YOUR MIND.",1154736000,,2544,4.812356979405035
7763710,5,B01GJQM5JM,"We here in the United States have been blessed with the right to tell others what our opinions are concerning politics, religion, and other areas of life. While we may disagree with one another, we are still able to live a free life with our own beliefs and lifestyles.

But what if that was not the case? What if, instead of living the way you wish, you had to live the way the government tells you to? What if you lived under totalitarian rule, and to speak out against your government was a crime punishable by death? What would you do then? Would you live in fear, or fight against the oppression?

This is the question raised by ""V for Vendetta,"" a powerful look at life under total rule, a world similar to George Orwell's ""1984."" The Wachowski Brothers, coming off the success of their ""Matrix"" films, have produced a rousing, exciting, and amazing story of one man who decided to fight against the system that left him scarred.

Hugo Weaving gives an exceptional performance as V, who uses terrorist tactics against the government, but never against innocent people. Natalie Portman gives another fine performance as Evey, a person whose parents were murdered by the government, and who finds courage with V's help. The rest of the cast, including Stephen Rea and John Hurt, give wonderful supporting performances.

The storytelling is fantastic, while the action sequences and visual effects are thrilling and visually-stunning. And while some may question V's actions, his actions rally the people against the corrupt government of Britain in 2020.

""V for Vendetta"" is a thrilling film, full of exceptional storytelling, great performances, and thrilling action sequences. Fans of the graphic novel will not be disappointed!

The story line is full of holes and where it is not full of holes it tries way too hard to make connections between the present and the events of the past, and the connections which all of our characters seem to have falls into that forced category.

The dialogue is drawn out and tries to come across as artistic, many times I found myself zoning out long after the point was made in these pretentious conversations.

The fight scenes are nothing revolutionary or exciting, its the same familiar fight scene you see in all ""over-hollywooded"" movies.

This film also perpetuates the growing anti-Christian movement by using a red, modified cross as the Evil State's symbol.

7763713,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Yes, ""V"" is for Victory.  And the victory here celebrated is the triumph of the individual over the state.  This is the essential and overwhelmingly powerful message of this most important film.

The movie is set in a futuristic London when a fascist government has seized power.  ""V"" is the shadowy anti-hero who, tortured and disfigured by totalitarian government agents, launches his own program of retribution, brilliantly begun on Guy Fawkes Day, the anniversary of history's first ""false flag"" operation, and played out to the strains of the magnificent ""1812 overture"".

In an early scene, a beautiful young woman, stranded after mandatory curfew, is about to be set upon by tyrannical government agents.  ""V"" comes on the scene, saves her, roughs up the government thugs, shelters her, and reveals to her his fascinating secret life, all the while hid behind his enigmatic ""Guy Fawkes mask"".  His story is compelling.  He is the perfect anti-hero.  And yet, the young woman can't accept the brutality of his vendetta, until she herself experiences the evil of the government's torture regime.  In time, the romance that develops between the young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, and ""V"" is as wonderful as is the movie's terribly important philosophical message.

Also, early in the film, the Rush Limbaugh figure of the government controlled television station is seen watching his own ranting relative to the now devastated former United States of America and bragging as to what he would do if he ever got his hands on the ""terrorist V"".  Of course, the lights in his luxury abode go low, and then, who should appear, but ""V"".  It is positively delicious.  ""V"" always leaves a red rose at the conclusion of his grisly work.

As the plot unfolds, the working class stiffs of the fascist state begin to see more clearly through the government propganda they have been ""spoon fed"" through the media.  ""V"" plans a final climax on, of course, Guy Fawkes Day, a year following the beginning of the action.

There is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.  The beginning scene describes the false flag operation of the ""Gunpowder Plot"" used ever since to offer a rationale for ever increasing government control of the populace.  And the climax, the actual destruction of the Parliament drips with historical and politica significance.  In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.  It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.  No wonder neoconservative Trotskyite apologists like Michael Medved hate this film so much.  It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.  A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.  In your face, Michael Medved!

The final scene is breathtaking.  See it.  And keep in mind ""V's"" admonition:

""Remember, remember, the fifth of November,

Gunpowder, treason, and plot

I can think of no reason that gunpowder treason

Should ever be forgot"".

This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time!",1154736000,5,3314,5.111731843575419
7763714,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I didn't get to see V for Vendetta in theaters unfortunately, but I am really glad that I purchased the DVD.  I have no experience with Alan Moore's graphic novel which is the foundation for the movie, but I did find the movie to present a world very similar to George Orwell's 1984--one of my favorite books of all time.  I was wowed by the thoughtfulness of the dialogue in the movie.  V has a few excellent, thought-provoking monologues throughout the movie which really make the viewer think.  The acting is also some of the best I've seen.  I am glad to see that Portman's portrayal of Evey was much better than her performance as Amidala in the new Star Wars movies.  The film also makes great use of different characters' perspectives to make the movie complete.

I do believe that one could criticize the movie for its seeming over-emphasis on discrimination based on sexual preferences, but it is a minor fault which can be easily overlooked given the broad scope of the film as a whole.  That said, V for Vendetta is an excellent movie well worth owning.",1154736000,4,1064,4.592592592592593
7763715,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Here is a classic plotline co-opted so many times, I've lost count! ""Brave New World"" has been the ghost behind ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""THX1138"", ""Gattika"", ""1984"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". Oppressive, sprawling government plows on unchallenged, until one individual decides to rebel/conform/escape. In the case of ""V For Vendetta"", we're talking a rebellion based on the inimitable botched plot of Guy Fawkes, on the fifth of November, 1605. A character, who we only know as ""V"", saves a media go-fer, played by Natalie Portman, just as she's about to be raped by two ""enforcers"" of the fascist government that has come to rule all of Britain and Lord knows where else, as the USA has declined into chaos and lost its position in the world. This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.

This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes ""mask"" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent ""expression"" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured ""V"", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's ""Nineteen-Eighty-Four"", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, ""V""'s essential ""sidekick"" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.

""Blackadder"" and ""Wooster and Jeeves""'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with ""V"".

There is a Mephistophelean quality to ""V"" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.

But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as ""V"" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well! Somebody doesn't like Blair's Britain, eh wot?

It refers to ""America's War,"" as a prelude to a dark and dismal future ruled by conservatives despots who use the media to brainwash the populace into believing everything they want them to.
It seems that Hollywood has been frustrated at their party of choice, the Democrats, inability to win elections, so they have declared all out war upon conservatism.
As a conservative, I feel descrimination every time I see a film like this and had I known this was simply a propaganda film, I would never have even bothered renting it.
So, if you are a conservative or a catholic, skip this one entirely. If you are a liberal who needs media to reafirm your belief that conservatives are bad people, this may be yet one more film from Hollywood which will do that for you.
In one scene, the conservative equivilent of the SS breaks down the door of a house and arrests a man for having a copy of the qoran in his house. The Islamofacists must love this film for giving them positive public relations. Very unAmerican film.

7763718,4,B01GJQM5JM,"V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.

I saw it in the theater 5 times, I just kept feeling pulled back to it. I cried like a baby every time I saw it. It's utterly brilliant. If it were for the movie alone, I'd unquestionably rate it 5 stars.

Such a pity, then, that the DVD transfer has obvious video problems. Particularly, the video brightness pulsates ever so slightly on about a twice a second rate. In scenes with bright color and lots of motion it's hardly noticable, but this is a story told in shades of black, so it gets rather glaring at times. In many scenes where the foreground subject, such as a person, takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest is a murky background, the background seems to subtly pulse and throb behind the person. It can get distracting.

I'm rating this DVD 4 stars because of this icky video problem, which I feel should have been caught and corrected before any discs were sold. I'm tempted to rate it 3 stars for that reason, but I just can't bring myself to give such a low rating to such an unbelievable film strictly for technical reasons.",1154649600,2,1188,4.52093023255814

Most of all it is a study in fear, and how it is used to manipulate us.

The actors hit their marks admirably, and the casting of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from The Matrix) as ""V"" is the ultimate in irony.  Additionally the plot, action and quirky Brittish setting are all ""spot on"".

7763722,3,B01GJQM5JM,"First off, this is a thrilling movie, both visually and in its performances. Colors bounce off each other, great performances feeding off each other. You really can't take your eyes off it.

""V"" is an obvious amalgamation of Guy Fawkes, the Scarlet Pimpernel, The Count of Monte Cristo, with a little of Batman and a few others thrown in for good measure. That makes for thrilling action and wonderful set pieces.

However, as political commentary, it's laughable. This movie can't decide whether it's anarchist, liberal, terrorist, or something in between (if that's possible.) It owes its anarchist tendencies to Alan Moore obviously, and its liberal sensibilities to the moment. But it cannot be both. It doesn't seem to be arguing for anything so much as rebellion against Orwellian tyrants, which isn't really that much of a bold political statement. ""We'd all love to see the plan...""

Finally, the ending, with masses turned out in Guy Fawkes' masks to watch the destruction of the old order is unintentionally chilling, in that it seems to drive home the idea that we will be free in the future when we are all thinking and acting the same way, in the shape of radical terrorism. Frankly, that's the sort of thing we're fighting against, and isn't all that different from fascism. ""But then it will be a good fascism!"" isn't really what Orwell and Huxley and the rest of them were on about, is it?

Sorry to point it out, but it's necessary to inject a little bit of reality into these male juvenile sadomasochist fantasies. England prevails.",1154649600,3,1550,4.859848484848484

7763724,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA  is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact.  James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.

Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving)  appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine.  The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.  One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government.  But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host.  Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film.  The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.

Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding!  Grady Harp, August 06",1154563200,3,1998,4.847058823529411
7763725,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is by no means a great movie, and I am not totally convinced it is even a particularly good one, but it has more spirit and bravado than anything I have seen in some time. The film comes across as current, decidedly a product of its time, and perhaps even relevant, which is something rarely seen anymore in contemporary popular cinema. We live in a very political world right now, a world of wars, aggressive internationalism, and often bitter partisanship; in other words, a climate that should give rise to much fiery and impassioned art. This has unfortunately not been the case. It is a little discouraging to see that it has taken a UK-Germany co-production to finally make a film worth arguing about, a film that isn't afraid to use the word `terrorist,' a film often shocking in its blunt political assertions, but with this misgiving aside, it must still be appreciated that such a film has been made at all.

I say that ""V for Vendetta"" is not a great film because on a level of pure entertainment is falls short of what it could have accomplished. It's just odd enough to be interesting and just energetic enough to be exciting, but as with any film fueled by ambition, some of what it attempts falls short. The first half of the film was quite riveting, but it begins to lose a little steam towards the final act, as the story gets stretched a little thin and the momentum of the piece begins to falter. The love scenes, albeit brief and for the most part unobtrusive, were nevertheless unnecessary and didn't quite work for me, nor did the scenes concerning Creedy delivering the Chancellor, which were confusing at best. The acting throughout the movie was good but nothing more. Natalie Portman was more than adequate and certainly looked the part, but her performance did not strike me as anything special. Neither did Hugo Weaving's as V, but then again it can be hard to judge an actor who is masked for the entire film (crafty Greeks!). The effects were generally vibrant and enjoyable, except for the CGI enveloped fight between V and a dozen or so policemen which was over-the-top in a way that seemed beneath the rest of the film. Most of these complaints can be credited to the film being overlong, which somewhat hurt its momentum, and to the filmmaker's attempts to do too much with one film...

Which is also partly what saved the film. ""V for Vendetta"" is a rarity these days because it is a film that has something to say and seems rather urgent to say it. This causes problems, sure, but it also injects the film with enough energy to make it often invigorating and always interesting. This is an unabashedly political film and in a way that confronts the conventional views and positions that our current pop culture insists on feeding us. The film is undoubtedly anti-Bush and anti-Western colonialism, which is not uncommon, but with a degree of passion and fevered insistence seldom seen any more. Its cry of protest is reminiscent of the anti-totalitarian rallies of Orwell or Huxley, and words such as `revolution' and `fascism' are used without hesitation. I do not necessarily believe that the movie is anything more than just that, a movie, nor do I agree with everything it could be potentially saying, but I do believe that art as bold as this, and as politically charged and confrontational, is the sure sign of a healthy culture. If there were more films that tried to say half as much as ""V for Vendetta"" our weekly trips to the theatre or video store would be a far less dull affair.

I am as impressed by the fact that this film got such wide distribution in the States as I am disheartened by my insistence that it would have never been made had the White House replaced the British Parliament as the primary symbol of the film. America is plainly mentioned as the cause of the war that brought the destruction of our present society, but due to its British setting, matched with its graphic novel appearance, the film is distant enough that those who should take the most away from it will probably take nothing. Despite this the film is still as incendiary as anything you will see for some time, I imagine, and should have been far more controversial and debated than it was. It is not great, but any film which in our present situation associates terrorism, the Koran, and domestic anarchy with its heroes, for better or for worse, is certainly a film worth seeing.",1154563200,4,4432,4.643312101910828

It is an action movie at its core and the action and drama are amazing.  There is a moral and there is a story, but it is more anti-establishment and pro-anarchy than anything that has to do with American politics.

7763728,3,B01GJQM5JM,"After watching the big screen adaptation of V For Vendetta, it's safe to say that I don't blame Alan Moore one bit for not wanting anything to do with it.  After seeing his From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and now this made into films, it's of little wonder why he wants nothing to do with the movie industry.  That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future; one of which is becoming more and more frighteningly real by the day.  Natalie Portman is a combination of worthy and wooden in the role of Evey Hammond, a would be everyman who gets involved with a Guy Fawkes-mask wearing terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving, surprisingly perfectly cast) who plans to strike back against the oppressive British rule.  The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re-created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director; but Moore's message gets lost in all the glossy action.  John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.  All in all, Alan Moore's comic may be much more worthy of your time, but the film adaptation of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, which in itself is quite a surprise when you think about who all was behind it.",1154563200,2,1689,4.576158940397351

The emotional lynchpin of the story remains intact, and that alone is enough to have me recommend it to anyone who likes good, well-told stories.  I confess, while I am a fan of several of Alan Moore's works, I don't hold the man in the same high regard that he holds himself.

Cast:  Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigott-Smith, Rupert Graves, Roger Allam, Ben Miles.

Running Time: 132 minutes

Rated R for strong violence and some language.

After a disappointing outcome in making ""The Matrix"" into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the ""Matrix films"", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless.  In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, ""Episode 3: Attack of the Clones"" and ""Garden State"") becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black (played by ""The Matrix"" trilogy's Hugo Weaving), who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name ""V"". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, in a fine supporting role) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator (John Hurt), whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. As the film progresses, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.

""V for Vendetta"" is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and takes a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy. While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's""1984"". Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the forefront all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism. The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architect in ""Matrix Reloaded"", the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. ""Vendetta"" takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.

When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.  When the year 1984 approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year 2020 just around the corner, will ""V for Vendetta"" do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought.",1154563200,,4529,4.986754966887418

I don't know anything about liberals or conservatives or any of that nonsense. I do know that I watch the world around me and I am often bewildered and frightened at the implications for the future. I don't care which side of the political opinion fence you fall on. This movie is thought-provoking in a way that is quite rare for Hollywood-produced films. I guarantee that whatever your beliefs this film will make you uncomfortable and make you think. I believe this is a film that will become more revered with age. Sure these are themes that have been seen before (it was based on a graphic novel written in the 1980's after all) but I think the themes are still very important today. You may not agree with the point of view, but any intelligent person can look around and see that we as a human race are at the boiling point once again. Unfortunately this isn't the first time we've been here, and it won't be the last, I'm sure. But maybe if we could stop throwing insults and bombs at one another long enough, some of the themes raised in this film could benefit from authentic discussion.

7763733,4,B01GJQM5JM,"""V for Vendetta"" is a return to the political science fiction movie.  Part ""1984"" part ""Soylent Green"" and part ""THX 1138"", ""V for Vendetta"" explores the political climate of a country that has gone too far down the road of facism in the name of safety.

The movie explains through the back story that the United States is in a state of civil war and England has been through its own version of troubles , but has avoided the problems the States faced through a very conservative government based on safety.  The problem is that the government has taken control of the lives of its citizenry.  Big brother has developed and the state controls the media.  A figure only known as ""V"" emerges and terrorizes the government.  ""V"" originally saves the character Eva in the begining of the film from government agents and then slowly turns her into a revolutionary by the end of the film.

The film is a study of what happens when a government creates a monster.  The monster turns on the creator.  The film is very dark and shot much of the time in shadows which heightens the intensity beautifully.  Stephen Rea is wonderfull as the chief inspector trying to prevent a revolution as well as looking into the government corruption.  Hugo Weaving is good as V and John Hurt makes a creepy high chancellor.  Only Natalie Portman is wasted here.  Not that she is bad, just underused and could have been played by any young and up-and-coming actress.

""V for Vendetta"" was originally a graphic novel and was written as a critique for the Thatcher government.  The film has been updated to include a observation of Bush's war on terror.  That if the safety issue is taken too far then society will rise up.  This is a very good film and thought provoking.  Not of all of it is easy to understand and you can't help the feeling the good guy is really very bad also.  My only criticism is that the film borders on a couple of genres without deciding which one to become.  It is certainly suspensefull, but it can also be sci fi or a political movie.  Recommended.",1154476800,3,2051,4.549180327868853
7763734,4,B01GJQM5JM,"As if the Wachowski brothers didn't wow us enough with the Matrix, they resurface again, this time with V for Vendetta, a very bleak look at, by all means, a very possible future if the human race keeps on as it is.  The story is set in totalitarian Britain, where the country is under a government run by a high chancellor whose name bears more than a passing similarity to Adolf Hitler (coincidence?  I think not!) and centers around a clever, charismatic, Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter known only as V.  Accompanying V on his quest for a new revolution is Evey Hammond, a seemingly average woman with a terrible past and ties to the very government she finds herself fighting against.

It's a long movie, so it does pave the way for quite a story to be told, and we are not treated with just one but several riveting accounts of just how corrupt this government is, and how most people seem to move to and fro about their lives, completely oblivious to the inner-macinations of their country.  The story I found myself most sympathizing with was Every's, having lost her parents in a political rally some ten years back.  And who better to play this role than American veteran actress Natalie Portman, who first truly caputured our eye on the screen when she starred as Padme' in Star Wars: Episode I.  We have dozens of English actors who come to star in American films, doing their best imitations of American accents, so why not have an American woman do the exact opposite?  Portman does it well, having trained for several hours a day for weeks on end to perfect her accent, it's a wonder she hasn't lived in the UK at one time or another.  Not that her accent overshadows her performance, Portman showed excellent emotion and sorrow at the right points, while not letting her guard down and feeding us little bits of how strong she truly is on the inside.  It takes talent, folks.  Talent that, to be honest, I'd have never thought her capable of.

Then we have V, a ""terrorist"" (I prefer to call him a hero) who makes a living out of wielding daggers and cavulting through back alleys dressed entirely in black leather and sporting an creepy, grinning visage representing the late Guy Fawkes, whose attempt to extinguish Parliament in 1605 is essentially the basis for V's mannerisms and outlooks.  Hugo Weaving plays this role excellently, deepening and shallowing his voice in all the right places, executing lines while taking out ""Fingermen"" with an acting prowess that'll have you cracking an ear-to-ear grin and leave you wanting more.

Let's not forget the high chancellor himself, Adam Sutler, portrayed by none other than British actor John Hurt.  This bloke is flat-out scary, hands down.  Yellow teeth, ungroomed beard, spazzy, evil demeanor, the works.  Sutler is fit for a straight-jacket, and after seeing Hurt go absolutely nuts with this part, I honestly don't believe anyone other than Hitler himself could fill the role.  Take a look at this flick and you can bet your bottom dollar you'll jump the next time you hear any word close to ""Sutler.""  'Nuff said.

Weaving, Portman, and Hurt are also followed by a slew of wonderful British actors including Stephen Rea, Roger Allam, Tim Pigott-Smith, and Stephen Fry, written by the Wachowskis and directed by James McTiegue, V for Vendetta is not only a movie, but a political statement.  It has the potential to really wake people up to the things that are going on in the world and what they can lead to if we don't start resolving things peacefully.  Packed with lots of dramatic dialogue, hypnotic Shakespeare quotations, uber-stylized violence and, of course, EXPLOSIONS, this movie will not only have you sweating bullets and sitting inches away from the screen from start to finish, but will make you think long afterwards.",1154476800,3,3811,4.803981623277182
7763735,1,B01GJQM5JM,"I am usually very lax with movies, knowing that they take a large amount of work and effort to create.  The movie however is an exception.

Reading the origional comic of V for Vendetta is like any great book, timeless.  If it is read in 50 years, the reader would be able to relate and understand the injustices of the depicted society.

Instead of preserving a possibly poignant message and making a great movie, the writers and directors have created something entirely ""NOW"".  To understand it, you would need to place it into a real-life historical context.  In the future, if anyone watches this they will need to understand the pasions and feelings of a time that did exist, but will only be able to do so by using the lens of the victor.",1154476800,42,745,4.522388059701493

I don't know what the people before me watched, but this film is at BEST decent, trust me. The story itself is nothing new, simply a story of pending revolution against a military/fascist state (worked better in the Comics imo) The film drags greatly, it has far too many lulls",1154476800,2,388,4.557142857142857
7763737,5,B01GJQM5JM,"It is hard to start at any particular point in describing V for Vendetta and just what type of movie it is. I could not specify the exact details of what you are supposed to know or comprehend at Vendetta's end. Some may think it was too preachy and some may think it is too sympathetic to the idea of terrorism and some may have thought it just plain sucked. All that aside here is what I thought about the movie. V for Vendetta's premise is somewhat simple to understand at first. It is set in England several years in the future and dark days have befallen the nation as a totalitarian government has taken over and ruled with fear and an iron fist. V the disfigured and vengeful hero who is out to make things right through any means necessary. But as it all unfolds realization quickly strikes that it is not nearly as simple as good versus evil it becomes a question of morality, how far is too far, and what is the justifiable cost of a revolution. Yes the story is grand and very well orchestrated and incredibly thought provoking. The title character V who is played to perfection by Hugo Weaving does a fantastic and memorable job portraying the masked revolutionary with his articulate language and firm belief that change must happen through any means necessary. Natalie Portman, though the painful memories of her playing Padme linger, manages to give a solid performance as Evey who ends up intertwined with V and his actions and is constantly at odds with herself as to whether what V is doing can be justified. One other memorable character in the movie is the detective who at the beginning of the movie is charged with hunting down V and how through his investigation into who V actually is he learns the government he has always been suspicious of yet loyal to has terrible secrets. These 3 characters in particular drive the movie .I wish the movies villains would have been a little better represented. Now what would a Wachowski brother's film be like without terrific action and slick special effects. V for Vendetta delivers big time in this department with terrific explosions and sensational fighting sequences that are brilliantly executed and an absolute blast to watch. The last one in particular truly is something to behold. One other cool aspect of the movie is how V's message spreads throughout the citizen's of England and how they are constantly getting closer and closer to going over the top and how much they want and believe in V's promise of freedom from repression. Though the movie has strong acting and fantastic action the movie would be nothing without the fantastic dialogue that perseveres throughout the entire movie.  Overall V for Vendetta is an excellent movie with superb action sequences and a tantalizing story that could make you question your own beliefs. It should be viewed with an open mind. Vendetta is not by any means perfect but it thoroughly is a fantastic viewing experience that should not be missed.",1154476800,,2967,4.738878143133462
7763738,5,B01GJQM5JM,"This movie laughs at all other movies and special effects. It is brilliantly a simple ruse to get you to laugh until you buy this DVD. You cannot stop yourself from buying it, since it is like the Mask you wear to go see the movie.

In this movie, a terrorist called V recruits an acquired ally he rescues by chance. Soon he begins spreading his propaganda by getting people to wear his masks. Like those masks, this DVD spreads ideas in the minds of others, who then begin to appreciate his control over his mind and try to exert control over their own minds, in order to block the media suppression and violence stopping information from being spread. This movie supposes that even in restrictive areas and physical places like dictatorships, you can survive somehow with the mind intact. It urges you not to policy hate and destruction and instead policy information and dialogue. It is the hypnotist's manual, and it is the disgrace of politics.

It further introduces you to the world of terrorism, that being a terrorist to self is a kind of self-meditation, since it takes HARD WORK being a good person in a world dominated by war, intrigue, politics, and poison. Poison because this world's worst fear is sickness and genetic codes.

Deluded by self-intelligence, V attempts to break into a news tower and tries to broadcast his message all over. His first mistake, however, becomes almost his last, and that is how he meets his heroine, who saves him with a can of Mace. This begins the whole plot of the movie, and it doesn't really feel like a movie for the first part. V spouts so many words with the first letter 'v' to our heroine that it feels like you're reading a book.

The first movie I've seen that makes movies look as moral and interesting as books. Certainly, parents won't want to censor this one and tell their kids that ""movies and television screens are bad for you"" and encourage them to read Clifford instead. I hardly need to say that seeing this once will open your mind if you're a right-wing extremist or hate Islam, since both are discussed here. In fact, ring-wingism is determinedly the status of this movie, and you should consider ordering your mind to this behavior if you truly believe politics can change world destinies, or World War III.",1154390400,,2280,4.650124069478908

There is quite a bit of gore, but that adds to the impact of the situation that Britain is in.  The angles of the propaganda shots, speeches, and the banners are all reminiscent of camera work done for Alan Parker's classic, Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"".  For yonger fan's, check out ""The Wall"" for a deeper appreciation.  Of course, the scarry parallels to the Thrid Reich are also sink in the realism of this film too.

I'll keep this short and sweet, and not delve into a whole mess of politics and plot discussions, as many other reviewers have done for the title, but instead, offer only my unflinching opinion into the Spec-Ed. DVD and the movie itself. I was first impressed with the production values of this movie. It is very well done, with a decent script (although title character V mutters so much political mumbo-jumbo at such a high pace, you may want to watch a second time with sub-titles on). Of corse, I have herd much hate twards the film from parties expecting it to offer either a more political view, or more action. In short, the political ideals presented here are nothing revolutionary, but mearly ment to make you ponder about how quickly human beings are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Admist this out-lying message, and montage of revolution, there are several well thought out fight scenes and sly assassinations carried out by V, leading up to the films ""revolutionary"" climax and Matrix-esque slow-motion ending that everyone has been talking about. In a nut-shell, it attempts to be both political and violent, but in the end masters neither aspect. However, if you go into the movie with an open mind, I doubt you will be disapointed... If you are expecting harrowing, controversial political ideals and messages, or the blockbuster action film of the year... well, look else where. As for the DVD itself, I was impressed by the special features offered in the Special Edition.

7763747,5,B01GJQM5JM,"One of the most unexpectedly pleasant movie surprises I've had this year was the Wachowski Brothers' brilliant screen adaptation of the DC Comics graphic novel, V For Vendetta.

It's not often you find yourself somewhat moved by something advertised as a Hollywood popcorn action movie, but V For Vendetta had that exact effect on me. After seeing the movie (twice), I bought the graphic novel and devoured it in about a day.

You see, even if it has been somewhat cleverly dressed up as a Hollywood popcorn movie, V For Vendetta is clearly a movie with a point to make. It's a story that has been told numerous times before (though not nearly enough lately given the times we live in) of the people rising up against an oppressive government. The closest comparison you would find in literature would be something like George Orwell's 1984.

The paradox of V For Vendetta lies in it's hero and central character, the mysterious (and sympathetic) masked terrorist known only as ""V,"" expertly played beneath the mask by Hugo Weaving.

V is something of a cross between the masked serial killers of slasher fare, like Friday the 13th and Halloween, and the avenging angels of Reagan-era action movies like RoboCop and The Terminator. But in between blowing up government buildings to symphonic soundtracks and slicing and dicing his enemies with his ever so trusty knives, V is also something of a renaissance man.

He quotes Shakespeare, lives in a crypt like underground ""Shadow Gallery"" filled with priceless artifacts banned by the government, and dances alone to the torchy slow jazz songs on his own personal jukebox.

But ""V"" is no angel.

Make no mistake about it. ""V"" is a terrorist who has a vendetta with an agenda, which is what makes this such a fascinating film. You see, ""V"" is a sympathetic terrorist. Remember that scene in the movie ""Independence Day"" when the aliens blew up the White House? That scene actually had movie audiences cheering in the theatres. When V blows up the British Parliament, you likewise actually find yourself cheering him on, which is no small accomplishment given the post 9/11 era in which we live.

In a not too distant future, America has been destroyed by civil war and England is ruled by the iron fist of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt, who ironically played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of Orwell's 1984), with the aid of jackbooted goons called ""The Fingermen,"" headed up by a very nasty guy named Creedy.

As the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that the rise to power of Sutler, Creedy, and company comes through the exploitation of fear created by a national crisis that, as it turns out, they manufactured themselves. This may all sound quite familiar if you follow the various conspiracy theories floating about on the Internet about 9/11.

Anyway, it turns out that ""V"" was rounded up with the rest of the minorities, homosexuals, and other undesirables and placed in an internment camp once the goons took over. In the internment camp, some very nasty medical experiments took place which V survived. And now, V is pissed.

After he rescues damsel in distress Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), an employee of the state run propaganda television network, from an attempted rape by a couple of the Fingermen goons, ""V"" takes her to the rooftops to watch him blow up a government building.

""Do you like music?"" V asks Evey in one of this film's several great lines of dialogue as the 1812 Overture blares the soundtrack to the fireworks over loud speakers in the streets.

But V is just getting warmed up.

Turns out ""V"" has taken a cue from his spiritual mentor, 16th Century Catholic Guy Fawkes (whose mask he wears), and has decided to send a message to his oppressors by blowing up the British Parliament building on November 5th (the anniversary of Fawkes' original attempt to do the same). Leading up to that event, he slices and dices his way through an array of villains ranging from the fascist government's television propaganda mouthpiece to everyone's favorite pedophile Catholic priest.

Meanwhile, with the none too subtle assistance of ""V"" himself, Evey has her own spiritual and political epiphany and becomes his accomplice.

As I noted above, there are so many great lines of dialogue in this movie. I couldn't begin to note them all, but here are a few of my favorites:

""A revolution without dancing isn't one worth having.""

""Beneath this mask lies an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.""

And my personal favorite:

""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.""

Though cleverly disguised as a popcorn action picture, V For Vendetta is a movie that makes you think. Even as it entertains you by blowing things up and slicing and dicing it's way through all the bad guys (loved the knife trails in the fight scenes), there is a definite statement being made:

Question authority.

The double disc DVD comes with some great extras, too. In addition to a short documentary on the making of the film, there are features on the new wave of comics focusing on the eighties and nineties rise of the graphic novels which spawned V For Vendetta, as well as a history piece on the Guy Fawkes backstory which inspired it.

V For Vendetta is a thinking man's action picture. I loved this movie in the theatres and I loved watching it at home. It comes to your nearest video store August 1.",1153612800,70,5419,4.814655172413793

Set in a nightmare future where an ultra-right wing government has come to power, V for Vendetta mixes a fantastic story with state-of-the-art special effects. Natalie Portman is Evie, an orphan whose life is turned around when she is saved one night by the mysterious ""V"", a vigilante who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and whose aim is the same as the original Guy Fawkes - the destruction of Parliament! And his agenda: revolution! At first horrified, Evie soon has to make a decision - to trust this mysterious masked man, or the government that oppresses the country every day! Who are the real terrorists - individuals who protest, or the government itself? Who is the mysterious V? What is the secret of his shadowy past?

This film asks many questions of us - and so you feel you are an integral part in the story, touching as it does on issues such as war, bigotry and racial hatred, as V appeals to the British public to consider their own actions.

V for Vendetta is a rare movie - an action-packed, but thoughtful film that makes you think about the state of the world today and the direction we're headed in. With brilliant performances from Portman, Hugo Weaving, and John Hurt, V for Vendetta not only  makes for a perfect night in, it also makes you want to get out and start making a difference - unlike some long and extremely dull books my girlfriend keeps insisting we read about generations of families in South America or people messing about in the Ukraine looking for lost pensioners.

7763749,5,B01GJQM5JM,"What originally can be thought of as ""Summer Popcorn Fare"" with large explosions, high action and a lead character whose anonymity is central to the film, surely could be an Oscar contender if positioned properly in its release.  Unfortunately, the marketing aspects of the film billed it to be an ""action flick"" competing with other comic book fare.

With brilliant dialogue and amazing acting skills by Hugo Weaving (who can act 100 times better than 98% of those in the trade today, and you don't even get to see his face), the film moves along one thought provoking scene after another.  The concepts of freedom and control and what society sacrifices to acheive each are beautifully woven into a visual and auditory orgy of intense stimulation.  So much so that a viewer cannot help but be moved by the images, much less the thematic elements of the production.

This isn't your simple bubble gum flick.  Combining some of the strongest themes of today, and possibly tomorrow, this movie strikes at the heart of what it means to be human and what it means to be free.  Don't be swayed by those who say there are comparisons to political persons in todays news... those people are reaching to draw similiarities.  The characters in V are not your typical black and white politicos, but rather in depth, troubled and complex beings who are exposing themselves to each other and the audience.

But as for things of substance, that is sorely lacking in this film, in which all she does is participate for baffling reasons in a violent revolution that looks amoral most of the time. And the regime being rebelled against just looks like a silly and unbelievable caricature rather than a villain of any reasonable insight. And there is a distinct undercurrent of America-bashing in it. While any nation should be able to take thoughtful constructive criticism, that isn't what we have here. The America-bashing is just as simplistic, unsubtle, and crass as it was in LOVE ACTUALLY.

7763752,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.

This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase ""The coalition of the willing,"" a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)

But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.

I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.

It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.

All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.",1152921600,15,5996,4.64326375711575

The Wachowskis have done something that is far better than the Matrix trilogy, not for its' action, but for its' plot. And I thank them for making a movie that actually makes a person use their brains. The musical score was absolutely stunning for lack of a better word.

As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. ""V"" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with ""V"" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from. The action sequences (minus the beginning explosions and Big Ben being blown apart at the end) were downright dull and a let down from previous Wachowski films.

Yes, V is right, each one of us is responsible for our society because we are all part of it.  I thought this movie suggests  we should not blindly believe what we see or hear - we especially tend to do so when we are in fear.

7763765,3,B01GJQM5JM,"Before I begin, let me tell you that I WORSHIP this comic series. Alan Moore is a God amongst men. This is the best comic series that has ever been. And may ever be. It doesn't just edge out its competitors (DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, ARKHAM ASYLUM, even Moore's other works like THE KILLING JOKE, WATCHMEN, SWAMP THING, and FROM HELL), it blows them away. The tale is the best example of fiction writing in any category. David Lloyd's art doesn't hurt either. It's brilliant and atmospheric. The writing is supremely intelligent, caustic, incendiary, touching, challenging, disturbing and witty.

But here, we're talking about the film.

And the film leaves you wanting.

I'm not going to get too far into the plot of the film, because everyone else already has. I will, however, go into my criticisms of the film.

Obviously, this is going to come under fire from some people who will read this because of the following criticism: Too much has changed from the comic to the screen. Evey's origins, the obliteration of what I believed to be ultimately necessary characters to the tale in the comic, the ridiculous characterization of Adam Sutler (read: [...]) by John Hurt, and the teachings/love/hate between V and Evey.

Really, the only scene that works as it was played out in the comic is the incarceration/torture/self-discovery of Evey.

The heart of the ideas of the comic are still present, but they are watered down for a more palatable consumption.

If you are a lunatic for the comic like I am, you've probably already seen it and feel the same way.

If you haven't read the comic, see the film, and at the same time, buy the graphic novel. Get them in the same shipment. Watch the film, then read the graphic novel. And you'll know what I'm talking about.

7763774,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Having been a fan of the graphic novel for many years I was interested to see how exactly the Wachowski's intended to translate Moore's early 90's view of the future into a believable concept for the twentieth century. Despite what most of the purists may say, Moores original view of totalitarian britain has aged somewhat, and an exacttranslation of the graphic novel onto the silver screen would have been far too esoteric and inaccessable for those who had not been previously introduced to the material. What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state. Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat. What we have now is a government that controls through deception and spin, by creating fear in the populace and presenting Anglo-christian based national socialism as the cure for all ills. This is in contrast to moores vision where the government rules by intimidation and violence, the citizens of britain are brow beaten dogs utterly submissive and incapable of thought, in this movie the populace have simply been kept in the dark and are awaiting someone to turn the light on. Enter V.

What makes this film such a triumph is it's assertion that no matter how entrencehd a governments control becomes, there are always going to be people who question them always people who look at the world and sense something is wrong. People know when they're being lied to, know when spin becomes outright lies and are perfectly capable of standing for their own rights. Of course V's attacks act as the catalyst for this process ut the ultimate act of herosim is performed by the public.

Yes there are better action films, yes there are better films that question the world we live in, but very few do both with such style and grace. This time the wachowski's managed to of their message without recourse to big black coats and rage against the machine music.

7763777,4,B01GJQM5JM,"Whether you may like him or not, `V for Vendetta' is produced by Joel Silver, one of the strongest players in Hollywood, the one behind the successful `Matrix' trilogy, and the script of `V' is written by none other than Wachowski Brothers. First-time director James McTeigue worked as assistant director in three `Matrix's and one `Star Wars' and yes, the titular `V' is played by Hugo Weaving. This time, however, you never see his face hidden behind a mask - like Agent Smith wearing glasses. And fewer action scenes.

`V for Vendetta' is set in the totalitarian society of England in the near future, where one masked anti-hero shakes up the nation's political system which is controlled by one Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police.

[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey.

To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'

Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'

`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.",1149465600,4,2958,4.884462151394422

7763779,5,B01GJQM5JM,"I'm very glad to see so many positive reviews for this movie. I was wondering if I was the only one who was in total awe of it. V For Vendetta is simply an amazing movie. I was a bit worried when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers and a first-time director were involved, however within the first ten minutes of the movie my fears were washed away.  V For Vendetta is spectacular in every possible way. From the first scene to the last, the movie is completely gripping and you will not want to look away until the end credits roll. The movie is well-written, well directed and well acted. Everything about it is top-notch. Everything. I can't think of any flaws. I'm sure that there must be one somewhere, but I can't think of any. It's unbelievable that director James McTeigue is a first-timer. The movie is so beautifully and effortlessly directed that you'd assume there must be some seasoned veteran behind the camera.

Being that it was based on a graphic novel and produced by the Wachowskis, I wasn't very excited to see it figuring it would be another bloated action-fest with tons of CGI and no story and I'd be bored out of my mind. Boy, was I wrong. For one thing, V For Vendetta is not even an action movie. It has a few action scenes here and there (particularly one Matrix-style scene near the end), however for the most part it's a fantasy/sci-fi/drama. Not being a big action fan I was thrilled by the lack of action scenes. For once we have a comic book movie that is about characters, story and ideas rather than special effects and car chases and fight sequences. The actors are great too. The large, primarily British cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly worth mentioning is Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith in The Matrix). Weaving gives an excellent performance in the movie despite having his face always hidden by a mask. How do you emote without your face being visible? That is the challenge and Hugo succeeds marvelously. Natalie Portman is also very good as V's helper/love interest and John Hurt is venomous as the evil British Chancellor.

If only all of the big-budget movies to come out of Hollywood could be HALF as good as this, we'd be in excellent shape. This movie will forever erase the memories of the Matrix sequels from your mind. In fact, V For Vendetta is better than all three Matrix movies put together. Bye bye Neo. Hello V.

7763780,5,B01GJQM5JM,"Sometimes when someone has asked me, ""What movie did you see last night?"" I've had to stop and think a moment before I could even remember what movie I'd seen. They're all alike, or remade, or just generic mannequins doing predictable things, so that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart.

Not so with V for Vendetta: you won't forget what you've seen!

Its chief resemblance to the book is that both are flawed, not perfect by any means -- but there is so much more to love than to lament! Both entertain, provoke, and haunt you with home truths, both move to laughter and to tears, and leave scenes replaying in your imagination.

The movie was wonderfully faithful to the book, not in every detail, but more than faithful in spirit. The graphic novel had many subplots, which filled out the story but at times almost detracted, or at least distracted, from the key ideas. A movie, of necessity, must pare things down a bit, but in this case it was like chipping away excess to reveal the facets and true colors at the heart of a gem.

What remains is a haunting melody about the human spirit: we do mess things up badly, but even greater is our propensity to overcome and be transformed. The movie added focus to the ways V adapted to unthinkable torment, and the way Evey (and the woman letter-writer) discovered in the worst of times that our ""last inch"" of integrity is really our only treasure.

* The movie highlighted the way the human spirit responds to horror and brutality--to survive, surmount, and transcend, becoming more than we were before. V rescued and preserved the best of the human spirit -- not just in the art and music and books he treasured, but also in himself. He could have become a monster, but it was his love--for humanity, for beauty, for humor, for integrity--that kept him from the edge.

* The movie also emphasized that ideas are powerful instruments of change, and ideas can't be killed. If change is to be accomplished, it cannot be by the will of one man (like the despotic Chancellor), but must truly reflect the will of the governed. (The deployment of the Fed-Ex packages, for instance.) ;)

I heard that Moore had at first withdrawn, but had a change of heart about the film--I hope that's true because, as the creator who wrote the above points across so many minds and hearts, he should be thrilled and proud.

It doesnt matter if the political roles were revered and V was a conservative trying to oust a liberal government the theme would have been the same. You who say that this is an attack on Bush are retarded. Go out. Buy the comic. Read it if you can. Understand that this story is powerful.

FILM

The film is an acute and welcome departure from the Matrix excesses. The only criticism I have is in the sound production. The multiple plot layers and other aspects emerge through dialogue with sometimes one or two words being of significance. I found it difficult to catch the words in a few spots, and to answer some questions, saw it a second time in IMAX, which was much better overall.

The direction is fine. Editing is quite good, especially during the historical background montage scenes. The pacing of the movie is excellent. At over two hours running time, it never dragged. The unfolding of the story through the police investigation helps too. The photography and direction during some of the Evey/V dialogues are also very good.

The CGI effects, so ubiquitous in the Matrix films, are kept to a minimum, to good effect. Also, the action scenes, i.e. the blood letting, are a smaller proportion of screen time than would be expected, also to good effect.

The sound track is an excellent complement to the visuals. Very atmospheric as well as dramatic, it supports the momentum of the film. The liberties with Tchaikovsky work well and structurally these scenes bookend the film.

What really makes the story line work is the acting. Beyond the three key characters of V, Evey and the detective Finch, the other parts are relatively leaner and several are short lived. Having an excellent ensemble of actors for these parts is a real treat, especially Robert Allam's Prothero, John Standing's Lilliman and Sinead Cusack's very touching Delia Surridge. John Hurt is very fine and Stephen Rea does an excellent job of keeping the development on track.

Natalie Portman's Evey is solidly good, but not extraordinary in my view. The affected English accent wobbles a bit between parts of England and occasionally crosses borders. Much has been made of her having her head shaved in the film. It works and her performance during that scene works well, if you keep in mind she was born and raised in Israel. Her physical stature is a bit problematic in being so waif-like, she has no where to go in terms of showing the effects of her imprisonment, but this is a minor point. Just praise has to be given for her scenes with V, as she cannot act off the expressions of the other actor. Lastly, she does a good job of evolving from a more childlike innocent in the beginning of the film, to a much more seasoned character by the end.

Kudos go to Hugo Weaving. It is hard to imagine another actor pulling off this role. It would certainly be a very different V if (say) Sylvester Stallone was in the part. Weaving's voice is one of his strongest tools as he demonstrated as Agent Smith in the Matrix series. The vocal one-dimensionality of that role is dispensed with in V. With material from Shakespeare and uniformly well written dialogue, he has ample opportunity to display his mellifluous range. As he re voiced the scenes after they were shot, he had the opportunity for nuance that might not have been achievable with set microphones. Volumes are spoken sometimes with the fewest words as in one incredibly atmospheric scene (D: ""Is it meaningless to apologize?"" V: ""Never"") or between Evey and V (E: ""You knew her?"" V: ""Mmmmm"").

But the voice is not everything. The body language and mannerisms work tremendously well with the voice. Which brings up the mask. (Terrific costume conception, i.e. hat, wig and cape.) The voice, body language and the mask create a unique character. Eye movement or anything else would have diluted the effect. With only voice and body, you end up looking at the mask and looking for an expression, at times almost seeing one. The shrugged shoulders during the rooftop conducting scene have you imagining a conductor's expression of eyes closed in musical passion. Similarly, when V relates to Evey his moment of personal breakthrough, the mask seems to come alive. A very interesting aspect of the mask, the other side of it hiding meaning in the dialogue, is that allows for ambiguity. A facial expression often explains a statement, but this makes V the more enigmatic. The mask also makes V iconic and more than human, an idea or ideal. V, in his last scene has the same appearance as always, and we think of him as unchanged.

ISSUES

Freedom fighter or terrorist. Both are clearly in the film. In the TV skit scene, the film makers identify the terrorist. Is V a terrorist? I would say no, although the government continually refers to him as one. He is a revenge seeker, but that is a positive quality in American cinema. My old dog-eared Webster defines terror as a state of intense fear and terrorism as the systematic use of terror especially for coercion. The population in the film, who would appear never to be even scratched (V explicitly states it is the symbol of Parliament that is his target.) seem never to be the least bit frightened and are in fact portrayed as becoming progressively supportive of V. The only people who realize intense fear from V are the government characters. (This might be a more difficult question about the graphic novel, with which I am unfamiliar.)

Pro Liberal/Anti Republican? Don't think so. I never heard mentioned anything about fiscal responsibility, size of government, government sponsored medical benefits, free trade/protectionism, social safety nets, trade deficits, strength of currency, labor, taxation, pro life/choice, but to name a few topics. Is it anti Bush? The name never appeared in the film and little reference is made to America aside from ""America's war"" having gone rather poorly. As has been pointed out many places, the source novel on which the film is based was attacking the England of the Thatcher era and the screenplay began before the Matrix series. The film is certainly critical of censorship, government control of media, intolerance, lack of political process, kidnapping, torture, popular complacency and authoritarianism. If you feel any of those things are part of the Bush/Republican administration's policies, then it is understandable how you might be offended. (I alwasy thought black bag was a fashion accessory.)

REACTIONS

The trailer for this film as well as it being a Wachowski product probably made most people think it was a continuation on the Matrix trajectory. Frankly, I thought the trailer appeared rather silly. Expecting a couple of hours of action distraction that I felt reasonably confident would not be a complete disappointment since both viewer and critic reviews in Yahoo were B's, why not take a chance? I had not read any reviews so the real tone of the film would be a surprise. And once the V character embarked on his alliterative soliloquy early on, it was pretty clear that I was not going to get what I expected. Some reviewers, particularly those whose saliva is not clear, angrily accused the producers of a bait and switch promotional campaign. Perhaps. Certainly not a marketing sin.

An interesting observation on Yahoo reviews. There is almost no middle ground. Either you loved it (A/A+) as thoughtful and provocative or you loathed it (F) and venomously, I am sure hypertensively and with Cap Locks on (and Spell Checker off), denounced its political disposition as anti Bush/Republican pro liberal propaganda of a bovine nature, being an al Qaeda training film (never made that connection), pro gay, anti Christian/ pro Muslim, and on and on. This apparently was enough to give the grade of F for Direction, Visuals and Acting. Interesting.

According to the advertisements, the film is rated R for strong violence and some language. In one viewer's comments, he/she was so incensed about the presumed promotion of homosexuality that they implored you ""DO NOT SEE THIS GAY MOVIE"". To offer proof of the earnestness of their conviction, the reviewer went on to say that because of this, his/her six year old daughter cried for several nights after seeing the movie. Under 17 accompanied by adult caveat aside, now that's concern for family values.",1143417600,11,8068,4.921323529411764

8763060,3,B01GJQM5JM,"fine acting and superb production value; still, this movie attains little beyond propaganda, which in retrospect is too obvious to provide temporary entertainment

the one true part of the movie is the virus. a structure designed to slowly crumble will be rebuilt by the people, not out of complaisance but out of fear of desperation. in the eyes of the people, those who are laid low by fate generally become the Example not the hero. good so far.

but people are not so advanced that they'd All peacefully walk past soldiers who had aimed guns at them only moments before. Even in a less individualistic state, even on behalf of the masses, the masses don't tend towards spontaneous order unless the structure is wiped out, and then order merely grasps at ruins hoping to rebuild the previous structure. it is correct to say people are a part of the infrastructure but incorrect to assume passivity or lack of contrary wills.. inequalities are rendered through biased disenfranchisement and artificially imposed classes; the masses are not hypnotized by their leader so much as by the scapegoat whom they wish to avoid becoming, so the image of an average footman in a revolution as shielded from desperation does not check
....the upshot is that the ""good guys"" in this movie, if accurately portrayed, would not inspire sympathy in audience.

spoiler below

I do appreciate that V's mask is never publicly removed so he's never fully humanized. it's grace despite his rise to fantasy heroism because he still dies before seeing the final act of his performance, and because he dies in a mask he remains an idea --allowing Evy's surprisingly cold speculation at the end: that ""he was [everyone]."" the female character who dies in the medical experiments is fully humanized yet blocked from redress: the foil. the movie somehow avoids choking both martyred-revolutionary characters with fantasy but the same attention was not paid to its overarching logic

at the unmasking, one glimpses familiar faces: we're to think the memory lives on... romantic, but this movie posits that revolution is in the hands of the people and imagery suggests the power of masses; however masses of people who die for a cause mostly die nameless. lucky the revolution itself proves bloodless! a strange sort of senseless fantasy, but propaganda does primarily inspire good feeling. truth gets heavy",1536451200,,2380,5.030456852791878

There's no fun factor to watching this so I'm forced to watch it as a serious movie, and I just can't take the mask, the bad hat, and the ridiculous hairdo seriously.

The ""Teenage Mutant Nina Turtle"" weapons somehow being able to defeat every bad guy with a gun, and the pretentious, stoic personality really amplify my inability to get past the look.",1536019200,,719,4.530769230769231
