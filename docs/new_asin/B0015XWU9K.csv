3148604,5,B0015XWU9K,"My husband and I have been watching and waiting for season two on this show.  We were in the Navy Seabees for 12 years and I say we because the wife is there too. Maybe no rank, but behind every good man is a great woman.  Roxy is so like me, a rebel, as a Navy wife.  We were stationed in Maine where I confronted a lieutenant about my husband's where abouts- lets just say being on such a small base, I was the talk of the base. I figured we all put our pants on one leg at a time, and after watching the premiere this weekend and Roxy confronted Joan, brought back memories. We just love this show and we were shocked at how it ended.  Can't wait til Sunday again.  I highly recommend this show for everyone in or out of the military.  It does show geniune examples of the military life especially when our men or women are on deployment.",1213228800,,841,4.097560975609756
3148605,5,B0015XWU9K,"I grew up with a father in the Navy and I have been a Marine Corps wife these past 20 years (still in and still going strong).  Have suffered through many deployments and am currently nearing the middle of a 13 month deployment.  My husband started out in the enlisted ranks and went the warrant officer route when he was an E-6, so I've lived both sides of the rank structure and can see that on ""Army Wives"" they've pretty much hit base living on square on the head.  I love this show because it realistically shows how my life has gone; I can relate to all of these woman!  Yes, the show is dramatized...who would watch it otherwise?",1213142400,,636,4.319327731092437
3148606,4,B0015XWU9K,"I will say that the t.v. show is very well put together and there are great actors/actresses.  A majority of the show is accurate, but I couldn't see officer wives and enlisted wives hanging out at the bar, LOL! Just doesn't happen, around here anyways. There are some parts that seemed far fetched but others right on the dot.

3148608,5,B0015XWU9K,"Someone said the women are what is left behind when men go to war. If this is so, Army Wives is a great examples of the homefront.

I watched the whole first season on demand cable, since my advance copy of the DVD was not available yet. I was amazed with the depth of the storytelling of this series. These 13 episodes were not soap opera-ish, as I thought they might be. What annoys me is such shows like the Unit which touches  the same subject matter and I have  seen weaken by the way they tell the story in their show. You won't find that here, the show is told with a female point of view. However The storylines seem real as if the screenwriters have written and lived it!

The cast lead by Catherine Bell and Kim Delaney makes this cast cook in a way I have not seen a cast mesh together this well in a long time.

This is good television. I only wish it was more than 13 episodes. But in these 13 episodes is a class act.

I cant wait until June for the second season

3148609,5,B0015XWU9K,"This show is amazing. It's a little unrealistic in some respects (as far as the military goes), but other than that - it's fantastic! It's Desperate Housewives meets JAG - it's funny, emotionally heart-wrenching, and touching all at the same time. Once you watch it, you'll laugh, you'll cry...and you'll want to buy the DVDs! You won't regret buying this DVD set - it's entertaining and also gives you insight into some aspects of military life. If I could give it more stars, I would!",1208736000,12,486,4.729411764705882
3148610,5,B0015XWU9K,"Army Wives was named one of the top 10 shows of 2007 for a reason. The show is extremely well written and has an awesome ensemble cast!! For those who are JAG fans (like myself) you will get to see Catherine Bell (Mac of JAG). CB and everyone on the show do a beautiful job of depicting life for military spouses. It does have alot of drama but it also has very humorous parts as well. The season 1 cliffhanger will have you shaking your heads and therefore make you long for season 2 to start!!! The Season 1 DVD has alot of extras, such as behind the scenes and outakes. AW is well worth buying!!! You will not be disappointed!!!",1207958400,24,631,4.223140495867769

3148622,5,B0015XWU9K,"What a Series.  Didn't have this network when it aired, but we are happy to watch it now.  Characters are believable.",1471478400,,117,4.523809523809524
3148623,3,B0015XWU9K,"On the plus side, this is a patriotic drama; and I am most of the way through the first season, and I have not heard God's name blasphemed nor have I heard the f-word or the s-word.  I am not even sure if I have heard a hell or a damn yet.

This does not mean that this is suitable for all ages.  There is talk of sexual relations (primarily between husbands and wives) and most sex scenes are 2-3 seconds long with perhaps the removal of a piece of clothing or a bare back (no nudity).  There is one sexual relationship (one time) between two 18 year olds.  There is also a mention of a homosexual relationship (but far removed from the main characters).

For me, I find this suitable for 14 or 16 and above.  You could watch this with your teens.

The characters have mostly been seen before (the alcoholic mother, the soldier with PTSD, the good girl gang, the snarky girl gang; the by-the-book colonel; the young man who needs to find himself, the mother who loves him too much); and often the storylines can be overly dramatic (the PTSD soldier who gets really out of control; a hostage situation, the birthday party gone awry).

In general, the characters are okay, the writing is okay; and it is one of the few shows you could watch with a teen.  It is also one of the few shows from television which does not seem to have a liberal agenda.

I was a big fan of Seventh Heaven; and I place this show a notch or so below that one.",1468627200,,1435,4.238970588235294

3148631,5,B0015XWU9K,Army Wives Season 1 A Tribe Is Born shows the group of Army spouses and/or family members getting acquainted with each other.  The first episode also touches on how easily gossip can turn one story into something completely different.  There is also a major moment during the Army Wives tv series that brings multiple characters together (though I must avoid telling out of courtesy for people who have not yet seen this episode).,1456876800,,430,4.876712328767123

Lots of strong female characters, and a pretty good portrayal of everyday struggles, like getting food on the dinner table, doing laundry, dealing with spouses who aren't around nearly enough, etc.  I learned a fair bit about the Army, too (though I suspect that their housing isn't actually that nice in real life!)",1431820800,,398,5.107692307692307

3148650,5,B0015XWU9K,"The first time I saw this was when I had to help my daughter with pregnancy problems. I never watched the Lifetime channel before and didn't know that this wonderful show was on the air. My daughter got me started watching this and I have been hooked ever since. I am a former Army wife and when I started watching this all the memories came rushing back. I love how the show focuses on relationships and bonds that are between the soldiers, wives and the Army. This series shows the different kinds of people that one will meet in the Army life. Claudia Joy is an example of how an officer's wife should be. She sees all the wives as equals even when her husband is uncomfortable with her view. When I was in there was a separation among enlisted and officer wives and one didn't rock the boat. There is a good relationship between Claudia Joy and her husband. There are times when she finds a classy way of standing up to her spouse and the rules of the Army that lets the audience know that she has a spine of steel to go with her classy style of manners. Denise is in two relationships of abuse. Her son physically abuses her because she won't stand up to her spouse and stand up for his own beliefs. Her son doesn't want to join the Army and Denise doesn't want him to either. Frank abuses his wife and son by not listening to what they are trying to say to him. Frank verbally abuses them both and he reacts instead of seeing them both as people with different opinions than his own. I love Roxy! We all as Army wives have been in her shoes of being the newbie and we make our own choices and mistakes. The relationship she has with her spouse is one that works for them. She is an example of a blended family and one learns that a person's background does not predetermine how one will turn out in life. She is a good example of a woman that is a survivor in life and that spine of steel will carry her far and Treavor is a wise man to see her potential. Pamela is a woman of great character and strength and she will need this to help her with making a decision about her marriage. She is the responsible one in the relationship while her spouse is reckless. He pushes her away by being cold and unattached even though he is passionate about her and his kids. They are his world. She will eventually leave but the question is when and will this make him realize what he has lost and what will he do about it. Joan is an example of an active duty soldier and spouse and Roland is an Army spouse who is a man. Their relationship is rocky and sometimes unstable. She refuses to admit that she needs help and Roland comes to understand that even though he can help other soldiers adjust coming back from combat he is to emotionally involved with his wife to help her and this will work against him every time. He will learn to step aside and let another professional give her the help she needs so that he can focus on what is important and that is their marriage and relationship because he wants to start a family with her. I love this show and I will miss it but I am happy with how it was done and how it ended. Yes, there was potential to carry on the series with a new set of wives, soldiers and BRATS but I think that the show was originally about the first main characters and I liked how they ended it. The Army wife's career is all about change and moving on to the next post where she will meet new people and learn to adjust to the changes on the new Post. I can say without a doubt that I miss the Army life and I wouldn't change anything about it because I learned a lot about myself and how I dealt with the everyday chaos that goes along with this lifestyle of choice.",1409270400,,3688,4.181179775280899

3148654,5,B0015XWU9K,The complete series of seasons was something to look forward too. It started down hill when all the original characters started moving away from Fort Marshall. It seems the writers run out of things to write about or just lose interest in keeping something as good as this going. The only thing that got old was Kim Delaney crying. She tears up in almost every scene for almost any reason. Get a life Claudia Joy. Other than that it's a great show and should not have been taken off the air.,1407110400,,491,4.406593406593407

3148774,5,B0015XWU9K,"Season 1 set the tone and introduced the main cast of Army Wives!  Since I'm affiliated with the Military (Air Force) I could really relate to the trials and tribulations of being a military wife!  Even though the Army is more  rank conscious, esp among the spouses of field grade officers and also among senior and junior NCOs!  The story line is very good and I really formed a strong bond with both Denise Sherwood and Roxie LeBlanc!  I hated to miss any episode!",1364256000,,466,4.5
3148775,5,B0015XWU9K,I enjoyed these shows when they were originally televised and loved them as much seeing them all again. I think it's a beautiful way to show how much our armed forces do for us in a very down to earth way.,1364169600,,205,4.024390243902439

3148784,3,B0015XWU9K,"We are in early season 2 and so far the show has been fun. Sometimes I think it is sexist, the way it focuses on men, or the way the only key female army officer is expected to defer to her husband's aspirations instead of her own, but the show is called Army Wives. So far I'm giving them a pass.",1363392000,,297,3.8852459016393444

3148799,5,B0015XWU9K,"I love this. The characters are built well and the story lines are great. Having been in the military, this depicts the life fairly well. I laughed and cried.

3148802,5,B0015XWU9K,"On AmazonPrime, I have been watching Army Wives and admit I've become a bit addicted.  I grew up near Ft Benning and worked on post two summers during my teens.  This show portrays the truth of setting as well as what army wives encounter.  By creating the General's wife as well as ones married to Black Ops and enlisted, we get a full scope of army demands on the families...the sacrifices still being made for us and our country!

Shortly after beginning this series, I went back on post to Ft. Benning, Ga.  It took my breath away!  The series had me primed, and I felt extra proud to be an American as the security gate MP scrutinized my license and said, ""Welcome home.""",1361836800,,676,4.411290322580645
3148803,5,B0015XWU9K,These girls are hot from the young one to the old.  Roxy is foxy Katherine Bell looks amazing how could she look better than she did in JAG 10 plus years ago? Wow and the storyline keeps you watching...good job,1361750400,,210,4.25

3148806,5,B0015XWU9K,"I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a quality series. I've enjoyed watching each episode of Season 1 and I find the writing, acting, and production of the series to be quite good. For those of us diehard Jag and NCIS fans this series fits right in.",1361145600,,257,4.375
3148807,5,B0015XWU9K,Their challenges show as a glimpse of the strength women posses regardless of their professional background!!! It also gives us an idea of the sacrifices that army wives or wives in general have to make and make everyday for their families!!!,1361145600,,242,4.926829268292683
3148808,5,B0015XWU9K,"I am not a series type of person, army wives lures you.  The series deals with life situations where you can relate those experiences with your own.

3148810,5,B0015XWU9K,"I don't have any connection personally to the military (just relatives in different branches), but I LOVE this show! It's so real, and they deal with problems that everyone else does. Normally I don't like books or shows that have multiple story lines, but with these characters it works really well. The acting is not cheesy like most soaps. I also like that I learn small things about the military. For some reason, this show really hooks you in and I can't wait to see what happens in each of the next episodes....",1360627200,,517,4.56989247311828
3148811,5,B0015XWU9K,Wonderful program.  Complex relationships.  Once you start watching it you won't be able to stop!!!  I will most definitely watch all seasons.,1360627200,,142,5.363636363636363

3148813,4,B0015XWU9K,Great stories...great characters!  Highly recommend!  I've been watching the series during my workout and the time flies by!  Each one leaves me excited to view the next.,1360454400,,170,5.222222222222222
3148814,4,B0015XWU9K,I always wondered how this show sucked people in. After watching the first season I understand why. So much happens in the fiest season. It's kind of like a grow ups 90210,1360454400,,171,4.375
3148815,5,B0015XWU9K,This is a great series that both my husband and I enjoy. We find ourselves discussing it afterwards and look forward to our next viewing to see what is going to happen next!,1360454400,,173,4.2727272727272725

3148817,5,B0015XWU9K,We just got hooked on this show and really love it.  It seems to solve problems quickly and doesn't let them drag out for the whole season.  In addition there are some great moral positions which seem lacking in our world today.,1360454400,,228,4.404761904761905
3148818,5,B0015XWU9K,"I've been a big fan of Catherine Bell for a long time and seeing her in a roll where she's sexy, smart, funny, dramatic, and beautiful is great in fact so are all the other women on the show. The show itself shows what the families of Military personel go through on a daly basis. Army Wives is one of the best shows I seen in a long time.",1360022400,,339,3.927536231884058
3148819,5,B0015XWU9K,I recommend this series to anyone feeling the growing pains of living the Army life. It shows the beautiful rituals - like standing at attention in the direction of the flag at 5:00 each day - and the sad days of putting your loved one's onto planes headed to war! It's very bittersweet.,1359936000,,287,4.433962264150943
3148820,5,B0015XWU9K,"There are plenty of reviews here that go into great detail, so I won't do that. I watched this because a very good high school friend of mine said it was great. I wasn't convinced by her review, however, because her husband was a career officer and she has a much more conservative political view than I, but she was absolutely correct. This is an example of TV at it's best! There is no attempt to politicize at all. What is there is superb writing, flawless directing, and great acting. In fact, you don't really realize how good the acting is until you see Jill Biden (later in the series) appear in a cameo and you get to compare her reading of lines with that of the regular ensemble. This is a very good 'slice of life' of soldiers and the military families and the problems that each faces. There is no attempt to sugar coat the story lines. If the Army would normally discharge a soldier, then that is what you see in this show. There are no miracle happy endings. A word of warning: you will likely find this show addicting to watch and will be very tempted to have your own personal Army Wives marathon. Through the six seasons, you get to watch children grow up, and are privy to very personal relationships with their ups and downs just as in real life. This show never lets up. The writing, directing, and acting never gets phoned in. You will be riveted to the TV screen for the 12-13 hours of each season. The title originally kept me from watching, but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot. It is without a doubt one of the best series ever on TV, and I can only say to you: Watch This Series!! Liberal or conservative, male or female, young or old, you won't go wrong watching this show.",1358553600,,1701,4.302180685358255
3148821,5,B0015XWU9K,Had never watched while it was on prime-time but had heard the series was excellent.  Got the new Kindle and this series was first on the list to watch. I wasn't disappointed.,1358121600,,175,4.46875
3148822,5,B0015XWU9K,"I really really love this show.  At first I thought how exciting could this be?  I never imagined that I would be so hooked that I stay up all night just go watch the next episode.  This reminds me of old shows like Melrose Place & 90210.  No they don't have the same story lines but there is always some type of drama.

I use to be married to someone in the National Guards (Army branch) but we never lived on post & now I am grateful that it never happened.  I don't think I could tolerate the drama.

If you want to know what it is like to be married to the Military then yes please watch this show, if you want to know what it is like to be married & have someone cheat on you, then yes watch this show, if you want to know what it is like to marry someone who loves you enough to adopt your kids then yes watch this show.  I think if you watch this show you will definately relate to atleast 1 of the ladies on the show or one of the couples.",1357689600,,947,3.8704663212435233

3148825,5,B0015XWU9K,"It's funny because I'm active duty Navy currently and my husband is Army reserve. We joke that I'm an Army wife and my husband is a Navy husband! I've heard bits and pieces about this series over the years, but never really had the desire to watch it. For my birthday I got a Kindle Fire and was looking for different series to stream and thought to myself, why not? I fell in love after the first episode! I found myself laughing, crying, and frazzled all within an hour and I loved it!

The characters are all very relatable and the acting is superb. If an actor can make you love or hate them within minutes of meeting them, they're doing something right in my opinion! Although being a military spouse is difficult, you can't help but love how tight nit the community is and the awesome relationships that can come from both pain and happiness. This series does an amazing job portraying that and I'd highly recommend it to anyone, military or civilian.",1356048000,,957,4.5
3148826,4,B0015XWU9K,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for a friend. She really enjoys the series, but had missed the first and some of the second seasons when she viewed it on television. It has some really great actors in it.",1356048000,,211,4.170731707317073

A lovable cast. Real life situations.  Drama peppered with very humorous parts.  At times a tear jerker. Kinda fits in the ""Chick Flick"" category.

I must admit, I am now a Army Wives.  Give it a try, and don't quit right away.  Give it time to develop the characters.

I wish there were more shows like this.",1354838400,,491,4.03125
3148829,1,B0015XWU9K,I lasted about 18 minutes.  This piece of melodramatic tripe actually seems to try to glorify military life and the fools who get suckered into it.  What do they not get about the fact that the military is for goons and losers who are unable to think for themselves?  What if they gave a war and no one was stupid enough to go?,1354320000,5,327,4.158730158730159
3148830,5,B0015XWU9K,This series is the most Amazing series I have ever watched and have ever been a part of.

3148833,5,B0015XWU9K,This show is entertaining as well as how it should be just because you are a different rank doesnt mean you should be treated any different. Isnt that part of having freedom? That would be like separating who are kids play with think about it,1335830400,,242,4.4
3148834,4,B0015XWU9K,"This series grabbed my attention from the first show. I had not discovered it on cable and found it when I was looking for shows with Catherine Bell from the discontinued JAG series. I've watched the first and third season and will purchase the rest of the seasons. One of my close friends is a military wife of a high ranking officer and through the years I've heard her say many of the things the wives on this series say. The expectations of her children are very similar to the children on this series. It has made many of the things I've wondered about with my friend so much clearer. I can only assume that the writers have a pretty good understanding of military life.

My only concern at this point is that it has the feel of an upgraded soap opera, which I don't like, but the shows are entertaining and seem to reflect what must be some authenticity of military life. I find it remarkable that so many main characters have lasted so long on one show. I understand that in the 2012 season one of the wives will be leaving. As I said earlier I will buy all the seasons and thoroughly enjoy watching the shows.",1331424000,5,1117,4.344497607655502

The women in this show make me feel normal again.  The people around me, for the most part, wouldn't understand things like being careful about how you wake someone up, unless they are one of the soldiers.  Missing someone and hoping they are still okay too.  Although lately there seem to be more people that get this one.  I might not be an army wife, and I might not live on a base, but there are lots of people like me out there, that have friends and family that aren't active unless they are deployed. Or have friends that are active but they aren't a dependent of.  At least for me, this show gives me an outlet for the emotions that my friends don't understand.",1269648000,,813,4.2064516129032254

The show doesn't focus on politics or the wars, just the story behind the men and women who serve and those who serve by staying behind and supporting their loved ones.

I was intrigued to watch all of Season One, but I've spent 2 years in the Army myself and 26 years as an Army wife, and this show is not at all realistic.  For good reasons, fficer and enlisted wives do not have close relationships, and enlisted and officer's wives have their own social networks and would not have formals or or parties together.  Tea parties went out in the mid sixties, and I never met nor heard of anyone like the general's wife. There are eschelons of relationships that reflect the spouses' ranks and a colonl's wife would not be having everyone to her house.  Having twins on a pool table, hiding them in ""the colonel's quarters"" run afoul of the law, and no prenatal or postnatal care is given to the wife.  Colonel and majors wives do not dress like that.  I'd recommend this series to Service wives if they want to get a good laugh, but it does not represent military well, and does the public a disservice.",1232150400,16,1001,4.472527472527473

It's not your typical sopa opera show like you'd expect and easy to relate or sympathize to. I love/hate cliffhangers and this show definitely has that. It leaves you hanging wondering what will happen next and even what you think will happen often doesn't. Can't wait for season two to come out on dvd.

Being a Army Wife myself, I have to recognize that there are certain things in the script that are a little bit different from the real Army Life and the Army Policies, Procedures and way to handle things. Anyway we all know it's all been adapted with purposes of entertainment. We all know that right? But on the other side, I think that the main message is clear and successfully delivered. Be and Army Wife is a though hard job! We marry a soldier = we marry the Military. It requires unexplainable amounts of sacrifices, we have to live and accept plenty of unexpected experiences and move on just for one worth cause... The LOVE for our Service Member. And that message is definetly in this Series with this awesome cast which whom we can  easily identify ourselves. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel anger, frustration, fear... It really appeals to the emotions of the audience.

Not only does it deal with serious issues that military families deal with, but all people, even those not in the military can relate.

3148882,5,B0015XWU9K,"As a military spouse living on a military base, I admit I was skeptical when I first heard Lifetime was producing an entire series about Army wives.  I was afraid it would depict us as women without depth, and I also worried that it would be over the top with its characterizations.  I am happy to report that I love Army Wives.

I see myself in all the characters and I see my friends too.  I like sassy Roxy, the newest member to Army life.  She is irreverent, charming and not afraid to buck the system.  She dresses in a way most Army wives never would to official functions and that just makes her more endearing.

Kind hearted Denise is the epitome of everywoman.  She is kind, classy and considerate.  She is the best friend we all want to be and have.

Claudia Joy is what every commander's wife should be.  She knows how to support her husband's command and reach out to new wives and keep the home fires burning.  She also is typical of many Army wives.  Ladies who are college educated, smart and realize sometimes their careers go on hold due to frequent moves.  The Army Wife motto should be:  have resume will travel.

There is Pam, the talkative, strong wife of the Special Ops soldier.  She has to be strong because her husband is gone so much and she has so little info on where he is and when he will return.  She is spunky and willing to show the ropes to the very new Roxy.  She is sincere and knows her mind.

Joan is the tough as nails Lt. Colonel.  She has done a tour of Afghanistan and now has  ghosts that haunt her.  She is ambitious in a man's world.  Like many Army personnel, she is at odds with the demands of her career and her marriage

This series will touch people regardless if they are connected to military life or not.  There's plenty of drama and so many heart wrenching moments.",1216857600,4,1819,4.3076923076923075

3148886,4,B0015XWU9K,"Army Wives is the story of a group of four soldiers' wives and one soldier's husband located at Fort Marshall in South Carolina. This series is based on the book of the same title by Tanya Biank,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-Wives-The-Unwritten-Code-of-Military-Marriage/dp/031233351X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army Wives: The Unwritten Code of Military Marriage</a>.

The series begins with Roxy, a smart-mouthed bartender who decides to marry private first class Trevor LeBlanc only a week after their courtship begins. Roxy has two kids by two different fathers and Trevor offers her stability, love, and a real family. She also knows nothing about the Army and is used to taking care of herself. Watching Roxy learn the trials and tribulations that come with being an army wife gives civilians who have no idea about it an insider's look. Then there are the more established wives like Claudia Joy Holden, whose husband is one of the highest ranking officers on post. He has also recently been overlooked for a position because one of the other wives called him a racist--something Claudia Joy won't take lying down. Also, there's Denise Sherwood, a sweet, kind woman whose teenage son often takes advantage of his mother's kind nature. Denise's husband is a major and he's overseas more than at home, but their marriage seems solid. And finally there's Pamela Moran, an ex-cop whose husband is in special ops. Pamela is heavily pregnant at the beginning of the series and we learn that it's because she's a surrogate who needs the money to get her family out of debt. The only army husband on the show, Roland Burton, is a psychiatrist specializing in post-traumatic stress. His wife is one of the highest ranking women on post. This ragtag bunch of ""army wives"" makes friends with one another despite their spouses' ranks, their own backgrounds, and their differences. They accept one another and the responsibility that comes with supporting the soldiers they're married to.

When I first started watching this show, I'll admit it was because I think that most things on Lifetime are a train wreck and I wanted to see the carnage. But this show is surprisingly good for the network that gave us such hits as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-of-a-Cheerleader-True-Stories-Collection-TV-Movie/dp/B000CS45H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death of a Cheerleader (True Stories Collection TV Movie)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-The-Single-Mom/dp/B000679MFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex & The Single Mom</a>. Army Wives is touching, dramatic, and entertaining. This is a story about real women, real marriages, and real lives that only happens to be airing on Lifetime. These characters go through everyday situations with the added pressure of having their actions put under the microscope because of their husband's or wife's profession. They have all the normal problems that regular marriages do: slow sex drives, thoughts of adultery, working outside the home, troubled children, they just have to do  it under more intense scrutiny. I urge everyone to give this series a chance rather than just shrugging it off because it's on Lifetime. I'm certainly glad that I did. Army Wives has the girl talk from a show like Sex and the City with the drama of a series like Law and Order and manages to blend the two into a fun, heartening series that anyone can enjoy. I look forward to watching season 2.",1215302400,11,3564,5.633147113594041

I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch a heart felt, woman powered, family oriented, full of emotion, militray style show that can make you empathize with people you have never met.  I also really enjoy the extras with this DVD set.  The Have at It! piece is a wonderful addition.  The deleted story lines also help really pull a few pieces together that may not have made sense the first go around.",1214179200,3,748,4.3768115942028984

Maybe no rank, but behind every good man is a great woman.  Roxy is so like me, a rebel, as a Navy wife.  We were stationed in Maine where I confronted a lieutenant about my husband's where abouts- lets just say being on such a small base, I was the talk of the base. I figured we all put our pants on one leg at a time, and after watching the premiere this weekend and Roxy confronted Joan, brought back memories. We just love this show and we were shocked at how it ended.  Can't wait til Sunday again.  I highly recommend this show for everyone in or out of the military.  It does show geniune examples of the military life especially when our men or women are on deployment.",1213228800,,841,4.097560975609756

Have suffered through many deployments and am currently nearing the middle of a 13 month deployment.  My husband started out in the enlisted ranks and went the warrant officer route when he was an E-6, so I've lived both sides of the rank structure and can see that on ""Army Wives"" they've pretty much hit base living on square on the head.  I love this show because it realistically shows how my life has gone; I can relate to all of these woman!

3383105,5,B0015XWU9K,"Someone said the women are what is left behind when men go to war. If this is so, Army Wives is a great examples of the homefront.

I watched the whole first season on demand cable, since my advance copy of the DVD was not available yet. I was amazed with the depth of the storytelling of this series. These 13 episodes were not soap opera-ish, as I thought they might be. What annoys me is such shows like the Unit which touches  the same subject matter and I have  seen weaken by the way they tell the story in their show. You won't find that here, the show is told with a female point of view. However The storylines seem real as if the screenwriters have written and lived it!

The cast lead by Catherine Bell and Kim Delaney makes this cast cook in a way I have not seen a cast mesh together this well in a long time.

This is good television. I only wish it was more than 13 episodes. But in these 13 episodes is a class act.

I cant wait until June for the second season

It does have alot of drama but it also has very humorous parts as well. The season 1 cliffhanger will have you shaking your heads and therefore make you long for season 2 to start!!!

3383120,3,B0015XWU9K,"On the plus side, this is a patriotic drama; and I am most of the way through the first season, and I have not heard God's name blasphemed nor have I heard the f-word or the s-word.  I am not even sure if I have heard a hell or a damn yet.

This does not mean that this is suitable for all ages.  There is talk of sexual relations (primarily between husbands and wives) and most sex scenes are 2-3 seconds long with perhaps the removal of a piece of clothing or a bare back (no nudity).  There is one sexual relationship (one time) between two 18 year olds.  There is also a mention of a homosexual relationship (but far removed from the main characters).

For me, I find this suitable for 14 or 16 and above.  You could watch this with your teens.

The characters have mostly been seen before (the alcoholic mother, the soldier with PTSD, the good girl gang, the snarky girl gang; the by-the-book colonel; the young man who needs to find himself, the mother who loves him too much); and often the storylines can be overly dramatic (the PTSD soldier who gets really out of control; a hostage situation, the birthday party gone awry).

In general, the characters are okay, the writing is okay; and it is one of the few shows you could watch with a teen.  It is also one of the few shows from television which does not seem to have a liberal agenda.

I was a big fan of Seventh Heaven; and I place this show a notch or so below that one.",1468627200,,1435,4.238970588235294

3383147,5,B0015XWU9K,"The first time I saw this was when I had to help my daughter with pregnancy problems. I never watched the Lifetime channel before and didn't know that this wonderful show was on the air. My daughter got me started watching this and I have been hooked ever since. I am a former Army wife and when I started watching this all the memories came rushing back. I love how the show focuses on relationships and bonds that are between the soldiers, wives and the Army. This series shows the different kinds of people that one will meet in the Army life. Claudia Joy is an example of how an officer's wife should be. She sees all the wives as equals even when her husband is uncomfortable with her view. When I was in there was a separation among enlisted and officer wives and one didn't rock the boat. There is a good relationship between Claudia Joy and her husband. There are times when she finds a classy way of standing up to her spouse and the rules of the Army that lets the audience know that she has a spine of steel to go with her classy style of manners. Denise is in two relationships of abuse. Her son physically abuses her because she won't stand up to her spouse and stand up for his own beliefs. Her son doesn't want to join the Army and Denise doesn't want him to either. Frank abuses his wife and son by not listening to what they are trying to say to him. Frank verbally abuses them both and he reacts instead of seeing them both as people with different opinions than his own. I love Roxy! We all as Army wives have been in her shoes of being the newbie and we make our own choices and mistakes. The relationship she has with her spouse is one that works for them. She is an example of a blended family and one learns that a person's background does not predetermine how one will turn out in life. She is a good example of a woman that is a survivor in life and that spine of steel will carry her far and Treavor is a wise man to see her potential. Pamela is a woman of great character and strength and she will need this to help her with making a decision about her marriage. She is the responsible one in the relationship while her spouse is reckless. He pushes her away by being cold and unattached even though he is passionate about her and his kids. They are his world. She will eventually leave but the question is when and will this make him realize what he has lost and what will he do about it. Joan is an example of an active duty soldier and spouse and Roland is an Army spouse who is a man. Their relationship is rocky and sometimes unstable. She refuses to admit that she needs help and Roland comes to understand that even though he can help other soldiers adjust coming back from combat he is to emotionally involved with his wife to help her and this will work against him every time. He will learn to step aside and let another professional give her the help she needs so that he can focus on what is important and that is their marriage and relationship because he wants to start a family with her. I love this show and I will miss it but I am happy with how it was done and how it ended. Yes, there was potential to carry on the series with a new set of wives, soldiers and BRATS but I think that the show was originally about the first main characters and I liked how they ended it. The Army wife's career is all about change and moving on to the next post where she will meet new people and learn to adjust to the changes on the new Post. I can say without a doubt that I miss the Army life and I wouldn't change anything about it because I learned a lot about myself and how I dealt with the everyday chaos that goes along with this lifestyle of choice.",1409270400,,3688,4.181179775280899

I appreciate the show dealing with real issues for families in the military, and the broad spectrum of those issues.  Good writing.

I fell in love with the characters and the stories, almost immediately.
This show is incredibly well written.
Wow!",1364515200,,168,5.035714285714286
3383271,5,B0015XWU9K,"Season 1 set the tone and introduced the main cast of Army Wives!  Since I'm affiliated with the Military (Air Force) I could really relate to the trials and tribulations of being a military wife!  Even though the Army is more  rank conscious, esp among the spouses of field grade officers and also among senior and junior NCOs!  The story line is very good and I really formed a strong bond with both Denise Sherwood and Roxie LeBlanc!  I hated to miss any episode!",1364256000,,466,4.5
3383272,5,B0015XWU9K,I enjoyed these shows when they were originally televised and loved them as much seeing them all again. I think it's a beautiful way to show how much our armed forces do for us in a very down to earth way.,1364169600,,205,4.024390243902439

3383281,3,B0015XWU9K,"We are in early season 2 and so far the show has been fun. Sometimes I think it is sexist, the way it focuses on men, or the way the only key female army officer is expected to defer to her husband's aspirations instead of her own, but the show is called Army Wives. So far I'm giving them a pass.",1363392000,,297,3.8852459016393444
3383282,5,B0015XWU9K,Loved Season One and looking forward to watching and reviewing the others.  I never say the series on TV so truly enjoying it's availability on my Kindle Fire.,1363305600,,159,4.678571428571429

3383284,5,B0015XWU9K,Have had absolutely no trouble with the quality of the video or the sound. Better than watching it on TV - and don't have to be tethered to any one room in the house.,1363305600,,166,3.911764705882353

3383288,5,B0015XWU9K,The show gives a realistic portrayal of Army life for the wives and family. Will continue to watch more seasons.,1362700800,,112,4.65

I've slowly found my husband checking in to watch from time to time.  Story lines may be somewhat predictable but the acting is good and there is great sincerity.",1362355200,,321,4.5964912280701755

3383296,5,B0015XWU9K,"I love this. The characters are built well and the story lines are great. Having been in the military, this depicts the life fairly well. I laughed and cried. Now I have to watch all the seasons so I can watch it on tv with my friends who have watched it for years.",1361836800,,265,4.018867924528302

3383299,5,B0015XWU9K,"On AmazonPrime, I have been watching Army Wives and admit I've become a bit addicted.  I grew up near Ft Benning and worked on post two summers during my teens.  This show portrays the truth of setting as well as what army wives encounter.  By creating the General's wife as well as ones married to Black Ops and enlisted, we get a full scope of army demands on the families...the sacrifices still being made for us and our country!

Shortly after beginning this series, I went back on post to Ft. Benning, Ga.  It took my breath away!  The series had me primed, and I felt extra proud to be an American as the security gate MP scrutinized my license and said, ""Welcome home.""",1361836800,,676,4.411290322580645
3383300,5,B0015XWU9K,These girls are hot from the young one to the old.  Roxy is foxy Katherine Bell looks amazing how could she look better than she did in JAG 10 plus years ago? Wow and the storyline keeps you watching...good job,1361750400,,210,4.25
3383301,5,B0015XWU9K,I love the Army wives and I loved reviewing the 1st season! So good and I'm looking forward to the next season.,1361664000,,111,4.090909090909091
3383302,5,B0015XWU9K,Being an Army wife myself I found this show very inspirational I am obssesed and cant stop watching the episodes over and over,1361491200,,126,4.521739130434782
3383303,5,B0015XWU9K,"I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a quality series. I've enjoyed watching each episode of Season 1 and I find the writing, acting, and production of the series to be quite good. For those of us diehard Jag and NCIS fans this series fits right in.",1361145600,,257,4.375
3383304,5,B0015XWU9K,Their challenges show as a glimpse of the strength women posses regardless of their professional background!!! It also gives us an idea of the sacrifices that army wives or wives in general have to make and make everyday for their families!!!,1361145600,,242,4.926829268292683
3383305,5,B0015XWU9K,"I am not a series type of person, army wives lures you.  The series deals with life situations where you can relate those experiences with your own.  The stories held my interest so much so that I would start at 8:00 p.m. And go through midnight.  I just could not stop watching one after the other.",1360713600,,299,4.303571428571429
3383306,4,B0015XWU9K,I really enjoyed the story line. I just wish that there were more characters of color in the show that actually reflect the diversity of our army.,1360713600,,146,4.444444444444445
3383307,5,B0015XWU9K,"I don't have any connection personally to the military (just relatives in different branches), but I LOVE this show! It's so real, and they deal with problems that everyone else does. Normally I don't like books or shows that have multiple story lines, but with these characters it works really well. The acting is not cheesy like most soaps. I also like that I learn small things about the military. For some reason, this show really hooks you in and I can't wait to see what happens in each of the next episodes....",1360627200,,517,4.56989247311828
3383308,5,B0015XWU9K,Wonderful program.  Complex relationships.  Once you start watching it you won't be able to stop!!!  I will most definitely watch all seasons.,1360627200,,142,5.363636363636363
3383309,4,B0015XWU9K,"My wife really enjoys this show, but I would guess so, since the screenplay leans towards a soap opera anyway.",1360627200,,110,4.55
3383310,4,B0015XWU9K,Great stories...great characters!  Highly recommend!  I've been watching the series during my workout and the time flies by!  Each one leaves me excited to view the next.,1360454400,,170,5.222222222222222
3383311,4,B0015XWU9K,I always wondered how this show sucked people in. After watching the first season I understand why. So much happens in the fiest season. It's kind of like a grow ups 90210,1360454400,,171,4.375
3383312,5,B0015XWU9K,This is a great series that both my husband and I enjoy. We find ourselves discussing it afterwards and look forward to our next viewing to see what is going to happen next!,1360454400,,173,4.2727272727272725

3383314,5,B0015XWU9K,We just got hooked on this show and really love it.  It seems to solve problems quickly and doesn't let them drag out for the whole season.  In addition there are some great moral positions which seem lacking in our world today.,1360454400,,228,4.404761904761905
3383315,5,B0015XWU9K,"I've been a big fan of Catherine Bell for a long time and seeing her in a roll where she's sexy, smart, funny, dramatic, and beautiful is great in fact so are all the other women on the show. The show itself shows what the families of Military personel go through on a daly basis. Army Wives is one of the best shows I seen in a long time.",1360022400,,339,3.927536231884058
3383316,5,B0015XWU9K,I recommend this series to anyone feeling the growing pains of living the Army life. It shows the beautiful rituals - like standing at attention in the direction of the flag at 5:00 each day - and the sad days of putting your loved one's onto planes headed to war! It's very bittersweet.,1359936000,,287,4.433962264150943
3383317,5,B0015XWU9K,"There are plenty of reviews here that go into great detail, so I won't do that. I watched this because a very good high school friend of mine said it was great. I wasn't convinced by her review, however, because her husband was a career officer and she has a much more conservative political view than I, but she was absolutely correct. This is an example of TV at it's best! There is no attempt to politicize at all. What is there is superb writing, flawless directing, and great acting. In fact, you don't really realize how good the acting is until you see Jill Biden (later in the series) appear in a cameo and you get to compare her reading of lines with that of the regular ensemble. This is a very good 'slice of life' of soldiers and the military families and the problems that each faces. There is no attempt to sugar coat the story lines. If the Army would normally discharge a soldier, then that is what you see in this show. There are no miracle happy endings. A word of warning: you will likely find this show addicting to watch and will be very tempted to have your own personal Army Wives marathon. Through the six seasons, you get to watch children grow up, and are privy to very personal relationships with their ups and downs just as in real life. This show never lets up. The writing, directing, and acting never gets phoned in. You will be riveted to the TV screen for the 12-13 hours of each season. The title originally kept me from watching, but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot. It is without a doubt one of the best series ever on TV, and I can only say to you: Watch This Series!! Liberal or conservative, male or female, young or old, you won't go wrong watching this show.",1358553600,,1701,4.302180685358255
3383318,5,B0015XWU9K,Had never watched while it was on prime-time but had heard the series was excellent.  Got the new Kindle and this series was first on the list to watch. I wasn't disappointed.,1358121600,,175,4.46875
3383319,5,B0015XWU9K,"I really really love this show.  At first I thought how exciting could this be?  I never imagined that I would be so hooked that I stay up all night just go watch the next episode.  This reminds me of old shows like Melrose Place & 90210.  No they don't have the same story lines but there is always some type of drama.

I use to be married to someone in the National Guards (Army branch) but we never lived on post & now I am grateful that it never happened.  I don't think I could tolerate the drama.

If you want to know what it is like to be married to the Military then yes please watch this show, if you want to know what it is like to be married & have someone cheat on you, then yes watch this show, if you want to know what it is like to marry someone who loves you enough to adopt your kids then yes watch this show.  I think if you watch this show you will definately relate to atleast 1 of the ladies on the show or one of the couples.",1357689600,,947,3.8704663212435233

3383322,5,B0015XWU9K,"It's funny because I'm active duty Navy currently and my husband is Army reserve. We joke that I'm an Army wife and my husband is a Navy husband! I've heard bits and pieces about this series over the years, but never really had the desire to watch it. For my birthday I got a Kindle Fire and was looking for different series to stream and thought to myself, why not? I fell in love after the first episode! I found myself laughing, crying, and frazzled all within an hour and I loved it!

The characters are all very relatable and the acting is superb. If an actor can make you love or hate them within minutes of meeting them, they're doing something right in my opinion! Although being a military spouse is difficult, you can't help but love how tight nit the community is and the awesome relationships that can come from both pain and happiness. This series does an amazing job portraying that and I'd highly recommend it to anyone, military or civilian.",1356048000,,957,4.5
3383323,4,B0015XWU9K,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for a friend. She really enjoys the series, but had missed the first and some of the second seasons when she viewed it on television. It has some really great actors in it.",1356048000,,211,4.170731707317073

A lovable cast. Real life situations.  Drama peppered with very humorous parts.  At times a tear jerker. Kinda fits in the ""Chick Flick"" category.

I must admit, I am now a Army Wives.  Give it a try, and don't quit right away.  Give it time to develop the characters.

I wish there were more shows like this.",1354838400,,491,4.03125
3383326,1,B0015XWU9K,I lasted about 18 minutes.  This piece of melodramatic tripe actually seems to try to glorify military life and the fools who get suckered into it.  What do they not get about the fact that the military is for goons and losers who are unable to think for themselves?  What if they gave a war and no one was stupid enough to go?,1354320000,5,327,4.158730158730159
3383327,5,B0015XWU9K,This series is the most Amazing series I have ever watched and have ever been a part of.

3383330,5,B0015XWU9K,This show is entertaining as well as how it should be just because you are a different rank doesnt mean you should be treated any different. Isnt that part of having freedom? That would be like separating who are kids play with think about it,1335830400,,242,4.4
3383331,4,B0015XWU9K,"This series grabbed my attention from the first show. I had not discovered it on cable and found it when I was looking for shows with Catherine Bell from the discontinued JAG series. I've watched the first and third season and will purchase the rest of the seasons. One of my close friends is a military wife of a high ranking officer and through the years I've heard her say many of the things the wives on this series say. The expectations of her children are very similar to the children on this series. It has made many of the things I've wondered about with my friend so much clearer. I can only assume that the writers have a pretty good understanding of military life.

My only concern at this point is that it has the feel of an upgraded soap opera, which I don't like, but the shows are entertaining and seem to reflect what must be some authenticity of military life. I find it remarkable that so many main characters have lasted so long on one show. I understand that in the 2012 season one of the wives will be leaving. As I said earlier I will buy all the seasons and thoroughly enjoy watching the shows.",1331424000,5,1117,4.344497607655502

Missing someone and hoping they are still okay too.  Although lately there seem to be more people that get this one.  I might not be an army wife, and I might not live on a base, but there are lots of people like me out there, that have friends and family that aren't active unless they are deployed.

The show doesn't focus on politics or the wars, just the story behind the men and women who serve and those who serve by staying behind and supporting their loved ones.

I was intrigued to watch all of Season One, but I've spent 2 years in the Army myself and 26 years as an Army wife, and this show is not at all realistic.  For good reasons, fficer and enlisted wives do not have close relationships, and enlisted and officer's wives have their own social networks and would not have formals or or parties together.  Tea parties went out in the mid sixties, and I never met nor heard of anyone like the general's wife. There are eschelons of relationships that reflect the spouses' ranks and a colonl's wife would not be having everyone to her house.  Having twins on a pool table, hiding them in ""the colonel's quarters"" run afoul of the law, and no prenatal or postnatal care is given to the wife.  Colonel and majors wives do not dress like that.  I'd recommend this series to Service wives if they want to get a good laugh, but it does not represent military well, and does the public a disservice.",1232150400,16,1001,4.472527472527473

It's not your typical sopa opera show like you'd expect and easy to relate or sympathize to. I love/hate cliffhangers and this show definitely has that.

Being a Army Wife myself, I have to recognize that there are certain things in the script that are a little bit different from the real Army Life and the Army Policies, Procedures and way to handle things. Anyway we all know it's all been adapted with purposes of entertainment. We all know that right? But on the other side, I think that the main message is clear and successfully delivered. Be and Army Wife is a though hard job! We marry a soldier = we marry the Military. It requires unexplainable amounts of sacrifices, we have to live and accept plenty of unexpected experiences and move on just for one worth cause... The LOVE for our Service Member. And that message is definetly in this Series with this awesome cast which whom we can  easily identify ourselves. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel anger, frustration, fear...

Not only does it deal with serious issues that military families deal with, but all people, even those not in the military can relate.

3383379,5,B0015XWU9K,"As a military spouse living on a military base, I admit I was skeptical when I first heard Lifetime was producing an entire series about Army wives.  I was afraid it would depict us as women without depth, and I also worried that it would be over the top with its characterizations.  I am happy to report that I love Army Wives.

I see myself in all the characters and I see my friends too.  I like sassy Roxy, the newest member to Army life.  She is irreverent, charming and not afraid to buck the system.  She dresses in a way most Army wives never would to official functions and that just makes her more endearing.

Kind hearted Denise is the epitome of everywoman.  She is kind, classy and considerate.  She is the best friend we all want to be and have.

Claudia Joy is what every commander's wife should be.  She knows how to support her husband's command and reach out to new wives and keep the home fires burning.  She also is typical of many Army wives.  Ladies who are college educated, smart and realize sometimes their careers go on hold due to frequent moves.  The Army Wife motto should be:  have resume will travel.

There is Pam, the talkative, strong wife of the Special Ops soldier.  She has to be strong because her husband is gone so much and she has so little info on where he is and when he will return.  She is spunky and willing to show the ropes to the very new Roxy.  She is sincere and knows her mind.

Joan is the tough as nails Lt. Colonel.  She has done a tour of Afghanistan and now has  ghosts that haunt her.  She is ambitious in a man's world.  Like many Army personnel, she is at odds with the demands of her career and her marriage

This series will touch people regardless if they are connected to military life or not.  There's plenty of drama and so many heart wrenching moments.",1216857600,4,1819,4.3076923076923075

3383383,4,B0015XWU9K,"Army Wives is the story of a group of four soldiers' wives and one soldier's husband located at Fort Marshall in South Carolina. This series is based on the book of the same title by Tanya Biank,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-Wives-The-Unwritten-Code-of-Military-Marriage/dp/031233351X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army Wives: The Unwritten Code of Military Marriage</a>.

The series begins with Roxy, a smart-mouthed bartender who decides to marry private first class Trevor LeBlanc only a week after their courtship begins. Roxy has two kids by two different fathers and Trevor offers her stability, love, and a real family. She also knows nothing about the Army and is used to taking care of herself. Watching Roxy learn the trials and tribulations that come with being an army wife gives civilians who have no idea about it an insider's look. Then there are the more established wives like Claudia Joy Holden, whose husband is one of the highest ranking officers on post. He has also recently been overlooked for a position because one of the other wives called him a racist--something Claudia Joy won't take lying down. Also, there's Denise Sherwood, a sweet, kind woman whose teenage son often takes advantage of his mother's kind nature. Denise's husband is a major and he's overseas more than at home, but their marriage seems solid. And finally there's Pamela Moran, an ex-cop whose husband is in special ops. Pamela is heavily pregnant at the beginning of the series and we learn that it's because she's a surrogate who needs the money to get her family out of debt. The only army husband on the show, Roland Burton, is a psychiatrist specializing in post-traumatic stress. His wife is one of the highest ranking women on post. This ragtag bunch of ""army wives"" makes friends with one another despite their spouses' ranks, their own backgrounds, and their differences. They accept one another and the responsibility that comes with supporting the soldiers they're married to.

When I first started watching this show, I'll admit it was because I think that most things on Lifetime are a train wreck and I wanted to see the carnage. But this show is surprisingly good for the network that gave us such hits as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-of-a-Cheerleader-True-Stories-Collection-TV-Movie/dp/B000CS45H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death of a Cheerleader (True Stories Collection TV Movie)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-The-Single-Mom/dp/B000679MFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex & The Single Mom</a>. Army Wives is touching, dramatic, and entertaining. This is a story about real women, real marriages, and real lives that only happens to be airing on Lifetime. These characters go through everyday situations with the added pressure of having their actions put under the microscope because of their husband's or wife's profession. They have all the normal problems that regular marriages do: slow sex drives, thoughts of adultery, working outside the home, troubled children, they just have to do  it under more intense scrutiny. I urge everyone to give this series a chance rather than just shrugging it off because it's on Lifetime. I'm certainly glad that I did. Army Wives has the girl talk from a show like Sex and the City with the drama of a series like Law and Order and manages to blend the two into a fun, heartening series that anyone can enjoy. I look forward to watching season 2.",1215302400,11,3564,5.633147113594041

3383390,5,B0015XWU9K,"I absolutely fell in love with this show from episode one.  We always hear and see stuff about the soldiers, but we never really see what they have behind them: their families.  This show really gives us insight in to the military life.  Of course, some things are going to be over the top, but that is what makes the show great.  I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch a heart felt, woman powered, family oriented, full of emotion, militray style show that can make you empathize with people you have never met.  I also really enjoy the extras with this DVD set.  The Have at It! piece is a wonderful addition.  The deleted story lines also help really pull a few pieces together that may not have made sense the first go around.",1214179200,3,748,4.3768115942028984

8260439,5,B0015XWU9K,"When my wife and I first watched Army Wives a few years ago I missed the first season. So this season was all new to me. It's a really good introduction to the main cast and their various situations and challenges in each of their marriages. As you'd expect with a title ""Army Wives"" the series explores the marriages of couples living on an army base. Interestingly and an excellent contrast, one of the ""wives"" is a husband, Roland, whose wife is a Major in the army. We see their struggles as she returns from a 2-year tour and the season closes with a question as to whether their marriage will last.

Roxy, the ballsy but sometimes naive bartender, is great to watch. Her directness and passion for her husband and girlfriends is tremendous viewing.

The season ends on a cliffhanger at Roxy's bar and I'm anxious to get to season 2 but, first, we need to get it back from a friend who has borrowed it. I'm curious to see how much of this season I missed.",1505088000,,960,4.387640449438202
