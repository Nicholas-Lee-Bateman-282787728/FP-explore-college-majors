8169442,4,B000MJUB1W,"I haven't seen this film since it aired on broadcast TV in 1978, but I have a good memory.  This film a heavily fictionalized version of the story of the pioneering self-published author (I think his pen name was Eric Weber) of the eponymous book.  Set and filmed in New York City with Dezi Arnaz Jr. as the struggling, can't-get-a-date-to-save-his-life writer, Abe Vigoda as a wordly-wise dispenser of publishing and life-living advice, and Bess Armstrong (who in the mid- to late 1970s tended to land a lot of ""All-American girl next door"" roles) whose heart is ultimately won by Arnaz's character.  It is a surprisingly sweet, good-natured romantic comedy with great performances by a capable cast.

I have no idea what sort of shape this VHS tape is in.  There are are lot of TV movies (like this one) and limited run series that ran on broadcast TV before the early 1990s, and which richly deserve a release on DVD or at least via instant video, at least as much of the crud that is sold and pushed these days.",1469318400,,1015,4.616666666666666
