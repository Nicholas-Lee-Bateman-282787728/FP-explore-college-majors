2053573,5,B00020SK1Y,"OH BOY!!! If this set is as good as the first, it will be GREAT! They finally put my absolute favorite Looney Tune, ""Three Little Bops"" on DVD and I'm so glad to see a nice choice of Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote cartoons, as well as the almost forgotten Dover Boys!!! Please Warner Brothers, keep 'em coming! There are hundreds more that I would like to own on DVD!

That's all folks!",1092960000,5,382,4.305555555555555
2053574,5,B00020SK1Y,"This set is going to equal the perfection of the first set.  Lots of Road Runner cartoons on this one.  But I have a pick for the third set.  It's a Bob Clampett cartoon called ""Coal Black & The Sebben Dwarfs"".  This rarely seen gem is one of the studio's best and most controversial (for its extreme racial content).  It's as wild a cartoon now as it was in 1943 when it came out.  One of my favourites and it should be in the next set!",1092873600,5,437,4.023255813953488
2053575,5,B00020SK1Y,From tvshowsondvd.com there's a date that it will be released on Nov. 2. I can't wait till it comes out!,1092268800,3,104,4.25
2053576,5,B00020SK1Y,The wait is KILLING ME!!!! I LOVED the first collection box set and i wish we could atleast know a release date!!!! but all i know is that as soon as this dvd is released i am going to be the first one to buy it!!,1089331200,,213,3.652173913043478
2053577,5,B00020SK1Y,"Hi There, I,m a big looney tunes fan. I loved the first DVD collection, and the 2nd installment promises to be a sucsess as well. However, I would kindly request the folks at WB who pick these shorts to include the following shorts in the coming collection (or the 3rd collection if possible):
- Bugs Bonnets
- The Honey-Mousers
- Hoppy Daze
- Ali Baba Bunny
- Transylvania 6-5000
- Hare-Abian Nights
- Cat-tails for Two
- Hillbilly Hare
- There is also one short which I would love to see, I don't remember the title, but it involves Bugs Bunny trying to help get a baby penguin back to his home in the South Pole (or the North Pole).
My ultimate dream is to get the whole 1000+ Looney tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts on DVD, I am certianly a buyer.
Thank you very much, and keep'em comin.",1088035200,2,791,4.315436241610739
2053578,4,B00020SK1Y,"If the second volume of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection comes out, here are my predictions for these upcoming disc sets:

  Best of Bugs and Daffy
  Best of Sylvester and Tweety
  Best of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote
  All-Stars Vol. 3
I'm not quite sure if I get them right, but maybe I'm certain one of these predictions will come true.",1086912000,,343,4.403225806451613
2053579,5,B00020SK1Y,"A humble plea from a loyal fan:
If anyone from Warner Brothers DVD is reading these comments (yeah right!), we can't wait for Volume 2! But can I make a suggestion? If I may speak for Looney Tunes lovers the world over, please just put the BEST remaining cartoons on this second set! Don't bother featuring just one character on a disc, or if you must, then don't add more tunes of that character on the All-Star compilation discs.
Plus everyone complains about the obviously blatant omissions of What's Opera Doc and One Froggy Evening from Volume 1, and rightly so. But the other tunes I would be hopping mad about if they were left off Volume 2 are: Robin Hood Daffy, Knighty Knight Bugs, The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, Hyde and Hare, Broom-Stick Bunny, Bedevilled Rabbit, Mad as a Mars Hare, and Satan's Waitin' (with Sylvester using up his 9 lives).
I would also love to see Road Runner and Foghorn Leghorn featured WAY more in this set. And Oscar winning shorts like Tweety Pie and Bird's Anonymous, and nominated ones like Beep Prepared, Mexicali Schmoes, and Walky Talky Hawky would be great to have too.
Is all this too much to ask? I don't think so :-) I'm counting the days until November when this will hopefully be released!",1086393600,26,1236,4.597285067873303

2053617,5,B00020SK1Y,"When Looney Tunes came around, they began as (like other animation studios at the time) Disney imitators trying to grab onto the Golden age period. Successful enough, they eventually became the antithesis of Disney. While Disney's Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy were cute, fun and family friendly, Bugs, Daffy, Elmer, and Porky were more wild and rebellious and filled with risque humor. This is probably the best of the Golden Collection to come out and a lot of memorable shorts (""Porky in Wackyland"", ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", etc.)  are contained in this edition. don't hesitate on this one!!",1465862400,2,605,5.111111111111111

The picture quality is amazing and I felt like I was viewing the episodes in high def. The 60s cartoons have been restored, remastered, and are uncut. The episodes also come with subtitle options in either English, French, or Spanish. In addition, there are several bonus features such as commentaries, behind-the-tunes featurettes, music, music and effects, or voice-only tracks on selected shorts, Bugs Bunny's Looney Tunes All-Star 50th Anniversary TV Special, The Adventures of the Road Runner TV Pilot, Daffy Duck for President which is a brand new cartoon, The Bugs Bunny Show: Bridging Sequences and Audio Recording Session Opening Sequences for 4 Looney Tunes TV shows, and From the Vault features.

2053741,5,B00020SK1Y,"There are still plenty of toons for the fans of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimpson.  Thank goodness this set has some nice samples of the work of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett.  By my count 4 of the former and 9 of the latter.  I've been a fan of Bob Clampett for years, and feel he was the best director of WB cartoons.  Clampett seemed to me a cross between Tex Avery's insanity and Chuck Jones character creation.  Plus Clampett's cartoons were aimed at adults with sly raciness and a ton of energy and anything for a laugh.  I apparently share this opinion with many of the animators/commentaters on these sets.  Clampett had the great Rod Scribner for his character design, and apparently let his animators run wild and do their thing.  The result was the best stories with the highest energy, the zaniest attitude and, for me, the best laugh out loud gags.

I have not held the same high opinion I had of Chuck Jones over the years.  While his character design was superb, and he has some notably great cartoons, I find his minimalist animation and the highly stylized backgrounds flat and annoying now, especially in comparison to the richness of every frame of the best of Clampett in the WWII era. Still outweighed by a lot of Jones/Freleng, but at least something here for those of us who love Clampett and Avery.",1362182400,,1332,4.5588235294117645

2053769,5,B00020SK1Y,"Here we go with the second volume of LTGC. The cover features a very primitive look, not that anything's wrong with that!

Disc 1 does indeed have some Bugs Bunny Masterpieces! Highlights are:
* The Big Snooze (Bob Clampett's final cartoon at Warner's)
* Bugs Bunny Rides Again (one of the better Bugs/Yosemite pairings)
* Bunny Hugged (one of the greatest with Chuck Jones)
* Tortoise Beats Hare (Bugs and Cecil Turtle's first pairing)
I also really enjoy the controversial ""The Heckling Hare"" (boy, we get some great ones from Tex Avery here!), ""Slick Hare"" (love Elmer pitted against Humphrey Bogart), ""Baby Buggy Bunny"" (very odd...), and ""Hyde and Hare"" (also very odd). Two golden age people have got commentaries- Bill Melendez does a commentary on ""The Big Snooze,"" a cartoon he animated for, and June Foray does a commentary on the superb ""Broomstick Bunny""- one of her first voice acting roles at Warner's. (It may be THE first, I'm not sure). There's also a pre-recorded Chuck Jones commentary on ""Tortoise Beats Hare."" Bonuses are a Tex Avery interview and a great TV special- ""Bugs Bunny's Looney Tunes All-Star 50th Anniversary Part 1!"" Part 2 is on Disc 3.

Disc 2 has 11 Road Runner/Coyote pairings, and 4 other great Chuck Jones-directed cartoons. I really enjoy ""Stop, Look and Hasten"" (IMO, the best of the Road Runner's), and ""Gee Whiz-z-z"" (if only for the Batman gag alone). The 4 misce-looneyous Jones cartoons are all well-done! We've got ""The Dover Boys,"" which was an extreme turning point to the zany side for Chuck Jones, there's ""A Bear for Punnishment"" (great three bears outing), and 2 other Hubie/Bertie/Claude Cat cartoons. Bonus features are great, and one of them is the TV pilot ""Adventures of the Road Runner.""

On disc 3, there are all sorts of fantastic Friz Freleng episodes, with some Clampett for good measure, and even a bit of Chuck Jones. The title of the disc is ""Tweety and Sylvester and Friends,"" so we'll see some good ones. ""Bad Ol' Putty Tat,"" and ""Room and Bird"" happen to be my favorites of the Tweety/Sylvester's. Also included is the first Academy Award winner at Warner's, which also happens to be the first cartoon where Tweety and Sylvester were teamed together- ""Tweetie Pie."" Great Clampett cartoons are ""Baby Bottleneck,"" ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery,"" and ""Porky in Wackyland."" One of my favorites happens to be ""Duck Soup to Nuts,"" a Freleng Daffy/Porky pair-up, which is very underrated. An all-new bonus short is included too- ""Daffy Duck for President,"" which keeps the memory alive well.

Looney Tunes All-Stars: Stage and Screen is Disc 4! We have some of the best cartoons of alllllllllllllllll time here- ""One Froggy Evening"" and ""What's Opera, Doc.""

2053775,5,B00020SK1Y,"While watching the Cartoon Network, along with our grandsons one evening after school, there were some reruns of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  What prompted me to purchase these (volume two) was the fact that they would each give great ""belly laughs"" and both were actually disappointed after the program ended.  I decided to purchase these so they could view them anytime they wanted and no matter how many times they view them, they can still give a good laugh.  If you enjoy watching some good slap stick comedy in cartoon format, then these will certainly please.  Personally, the cartoons of today are lame and uninteresting and the animation & story line are so poor you have a tendency to nod off but not while watching Looney Tunes.  They were a favorite during my childhood and remain so to this day and I was happy to see our grandsons enjoy them also.",1272240000,2,860,4.66887417218543

2053790,5,B00020SK1Y,"This is the second installment of LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION series. Like the first it offers four DVDS, each of which has a theme. This time around, there is an extra cartoon per disc, so we get 60 cartoons instead of the 56 in VOLUME 1. However, not all the cartoons are in color this time. Two are in black-and-white.

Like the first set, the first disc exclusively features Bugs Bunny. It's not as good as the first one, though, as it is mostly comprised of pre-1948 shorts(I personally like the post-1948 ones). But people who prefer these earlier cartoons will enjoy this disc.

The second disc is mostly devoted to the Road Runner and Coyote. Unlike in the first set, where we were treated to only one Road Runner cartoon, here we get eleven, as well as the unaired pilot ""The Adventures of the Road Runner."" The rest of the disc is made up of various other Chuck Jones films. Overall the disc is excellent.

The third disc stars Sylvester and Tweety in nine of their best cartoons. The rest of the disc is somewhat uneven, ranging from Chuck Jones' bland ""Old Glory"" to Bob Clampett's masterpiece ""Porky in Wackyland.""

The fourth disc is a mixed bag of various Looney Tunes characters. It contains some very good cartoons (""Show Biz Bugs"") and some not-so-good ones (""Katnip Korner""). It also corrects an oversight: It contains ""One Froggy Evening"" and ""What's Opera, Doc?"", two classic cartoons conspicuously missing from VOLUME 1.

Overall this volume is not as good as the first one, but when coupled with it. It comprises the very best of the Looney Tunes. This series went to produce four more boxes, but none of the subsequent sets had the power of the first two as a set. (Except perhaps the Bugs Bunny disc from VOLUME 4, which should have been on this set, but we can't have it all, can we?)",1255910400,6,1813,4.6006191950464395

These are the great cartoons your local TV stations ran in the afternoons back in the 50's and 60's; the cartoons that led off the movies at the theatres back then, as well as the great Saturday morning cartoons.  They are timeless and even though your kids are into the electronics and super hero stuff today, this is material you will surely enjoy together.

My seven year old and I just load up into the big chair and enjoy!

Lots of road runner cartoons in this volume for those of you that enjoyed those so much like me.",1248220800,2,594,4.422018348623853
2053793,3,B00020SK1Y,"OK, everybody knows how great WB Looney Tunes can be, but who wants a huge catalogued selection like this?  It may be fine for the archives or those collectors who enjoy having everything alphabetized and sitting on their shelf for the world to see, but seldom take the thing down to enjoy it.  And that's the problem with this set.  First cartoon on disc one ""The Big Snooze"" should have been the title for this whole set, disc one and four excluded.  Yes, disc 1's Bugs Bunny Masterpieces are just that - and nobody minds watching consecutive Bugs cartoons.  It's only when we reach Disc 2 that the whole thing starts taking a dive bomb and really starts to show just how stupid an idea it was to keep each character on one disc.  While that may be ok for Bugs Bunny, it is definitely NOT ok for 15 consecutive Road Runner (and friends) cartoons.  Please!  Who can stand so much inanity in one serving?  Then there's Tweety and Sylvester on Disc Three - most of these cartoons follow the same routine as Road Runner coyote schtick and it's just maddening to have to sit through cartoon after cartoon of the same theme and characters.  To be honest, I am not a Tweety fan though Sylvester can be great - for an excellent selection of Sylvester cartoons, the disc dedicated to Cats in Looney Tunes 4 is a genuine riot - unlike the schlock on this set.  OK, maybe that's too strong.  The Merry Melodies on disc 4 are cool, but shouldn't have been put back to back as they do in the first 8 episodes.  Seriously, the organizing of the episodes on the discs this way was a very unpractical and unappetizing way to serve up the Looney Tunes.

PS - Actually, it's hard to beleive this is going for under $13 new right now.  That is a GREAT DEAL and completely worth it if for no other reason than disc one, which has 15 Bugs Bunny cartoons on it, most of which are excellent and classic Bugs, and disc 4 which also has some great episodes.  Consider the other 2 discs 'bonus' and that's a steal!  Actually, to be fair to disc 4, episodes 9 - 15 are all excellent, four of them Bugs cartoons, peaking with episode 14, ""What's Opera, Doc"" where Fudd's Viking character has a magic hat which can summon the forces of nature to 'kill the wabbit'.  The wabbit, for his part, has no qualms about transforming himself into a beautiful she-viking pwincess that seduces Fudd - until he discovers the shocking twuth.

Hubie & Bertie with Claude the cat are a riot and the cartoon entitled Three Little Bops (Three Little Pigs) is absolutely brilliant! However, The Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote back to back to back becomes a little tiresome. Even Tweetie & Sylvester wear a little thin after watching so many of them in succession.

The only complaint I have about the set is that the dvd's are separated by character. I love the road runner cartoons but an entire disk of road runner is just way too much.

When I was younger watching on Saturday morning, I would see Bugs run off the cliff and turn into a literal Jack@$$ or see the characters shoot themselves with guns.  Now they edit all this stuff out, which was an essential part of the Looney Toons humor and draw in my opinion.

These Golden sets fix all that because they are unedited, which rocks.  It's so great to see them in their original and untarnished form.  You can't see these full versions on Saturday morning anymore and that's just sad.",1231286400,2,583,4.5673076923076925

2053808,5,B00020SK1Y,"Volume Two is actually a better collection than Volume One. This collection contains 60 cartoons, 15 per disc. Disc One is titled Bugs Bunny Masterpieces, many are Bugs Bunny classics. Disc Two is titled Road Runner &  Friends. Not all feature the Road Runner, the last few are one-hit wonders, such as ""The Dover Boys"". Disc Three is titled Tweety & Sylvester & Friends. Once again, some are without the title characters. Disc Four is titled Looney Tunes All Stars: On Stage & Screen. This disc does contain ""One Froggy Evening"" which won an Academy Award. There are some Bugs Bunny cartoons on this disc, it also contains some one shots, such as ""I Love to Singa"", a takeoff on the Jazz Singer. Like Volume One's disc four, Volume Two's disc four is the least enjoyable.

Warner Bros. is charging an exorbitant price for these collections, if you don't catch them on sale, you're probably overpaying. In general, disc four has the cartoons we're least interested in, it's the padding of the set, it's only reason for being there is so Warner Bros. can make even more money by increasing the number of volumes being released.

This is another great set, with some classic episodes that were left off of volume 1 and some generally zany and surrealistic ones, many of which I have never seen before.  I didn't like this one as well as volume 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) too many cartoons with the same characters on each DVD. I prefer when they get mixed up, rather than sitting through a bunch of Tweety and Sylvesters all in a row. And 2) too many cartoons that have obscure references (such as old Hollywood stars and popular literature from the early 20th century) that kids just won't get -- and you probably won't either. If you don't have volume 1, get that one. If you do, then go ahead and get this one.  It is a worthy addition to your cartoon library!",1209340800,2,854,4.33125

Today, cartoons are mostly for adult viewing.  They teach kids about fighting and blood spurting from wounds, or that backtalting parents, bad language etc. is acceptable behavior.  Granted that there is violence in these cartoons as well, but the caliber is much lower, and not nearly as likely to be imitated by children.

2053820,4,B00020SK1Y,"I ordered all the Looney Toon Golden Collection DVDs. So far, Amazon has sent me boxes #1, #2 and #4. That was yesterday, so I haven't had a chance to check everything out yet. Here's what I have noticed at this point:
ARTWORK ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES
Volume 1--It's stupendous! It's colossal!....
Volume 2--Not bad...
Volume 4--Just OK
I guess they ran out of steam (or money).
PICTURE/SOUND QUALITY--Fabulous.
BONUS FEATURES
A fantastic array of goodies on all volumes...
HOWEVER.....On Volume 2, Disc 4 is listed as having ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"". On the disc, I can't find it. Was it in an Easter egg I missed?
And in Volume 4, Disc 2, there's a SNAFU cartoon called ""The Goldbrick"". Warner cartoons zip and sparkle at the industry standard film speed of 24 frames per second.  Warner Bros. DVD has very lovingly transferred this gem at the wrong film speed of 18 frames per second! The soundtrack slogs along through the mud, and the animation looks jerky. To the meatball at Warner's who made the executive decision to pull this little stunt, I say, ""You're dethpicable!""
THE MEANING OF ""RESTORED AND REMASTERED""
I cringe every time I see these words on DVDs of classic animation, because they mean whatever the manufacturer chooses, NOT Daniel Webster.
On Disc 4 of Volume 2, two of my all-time favorites ""Hollywood Steps Out"" and ""Have You Got Any Castles"" challenge the definition of ""restored"".
The beginning and ending of ""Castles"" includes scenes which were cut from the laser disc edition. As the camera pans over to a town crier, 2 BIG, THICK vertical scratches run through, marking the start and end of the part to be edited. My God! I hope this isn't the original negative!  But not to worry. Nowadays, digital cut-and-paste technology allows frame-by-frame restoration of such defacing on any computer. But Warner's did NOT restore this. It's a jarring, disturbing experience. Way to go!
In ""Hollywood"", there is a scene of The Three Stooges, and HERE is where the Warner's digital computer wizardry was used. On each and every frame, Moe's hair has been beautifully painted PURPLE.  So, instead of using the computer to restore ""Castles"", they spent endless hours at the computer, frame by frame, giving us purple hair on Moe, which nobody ever wanted anyway. Imagine the guy at Warner's who came up with THAT bright idea. What a maroon.
I'm a little bit wary to watch more of these cartoons, afraid of whatever other ""improvements"" I may unearth. In any case, every time I encounter this digital fiddling, I can't help but think ""This is no way to run a railroad"".",1200528000,15,2583,4.826185101580135

What made the cartoons so special was that the creators made them for themselves! They wanted to make each other laugh and that is why so many of the gags go over the ""little ones"" heads. Bugs,Daffy,Porky,Elmer,Foghorn,Speedy,Wile E.,Roadrunner,Sylvester and Tweety......I'm sure I'm forgetting someone? These are the best characters in Toonsville!

2053840,5,B00020SK1Y,"In this second volume of the Golden Collection series, fans are treated to another mostly tasty round of Looney Tunes classics. Disc 1 is again given over to Bugs Bunny, and there are actually more of the zaniest and most subversive Bugs shorts here than in Volume 1. These include the immortality hysterical, and often weirdly twisted, ""The Big Snooze,"" ""Little Red Riding Rabbit,"" and ""Tortoise Beats Hare,"" and my nominee for the most astonishing artwork and animation styles ever in ""Gorilla My Dreams."" (Before computers came along, did animation ever reach the technical heights, not to mention artistic accomplishments, of the 1940s Warner Brothers classics? I doubt it.) Discs 2 and 3 offer heaping helpings of Road Runner & Coyote and Tweety & Sylvester. This set also gives us a much greater look at the wondrously bizarre classics from the cracked mind of Bob Clampett, especially the early Porky & Daffy workouts ""Baby Bottleneck,"" ""The Great Piggybank Robbery,"" and the animation/live action B&W treat ""You Ought to Be in Pictures.""

With the inclusion of Disc 4 (a themed disc for pop culture and Hollywood-oriented shorts), this volume offers a great amount of overall WB variety, with room for the immortal classics ""One Froggy Evening"" and ""What's Opera Doc,"" not to mention the impossibly bizarre ""Porky in Wackyland,"" which really makes you wonder if anything on Earth in the late 1930s was as weird as the shorts coming out of Termite Terrace. In that regard, also check out one of the DVD extras, an archaically cheesy live action short starring monkeys, ""Orange Blossoms for Violet,"" a very early project by Chuck Jones and Friz Freling. But aside from those classics, this volume shows a few cracks in the greatest-hits strategy of these DVD collections, as the variety sometimes seems forced. Here we get a smattering of old shorts that won't really be of interest to anyone but completists, such as the awkwardly unfunny non-star episodes ""Have You Got Any Castles"" and ""The Dover Boys,"" and a few installments of the unlikable and mostly forgotten mouse duo Hubie and Bertie. In just the second volume of this crucial DVD series, diminishing returns are already becoming evident as Warner Brothers selects cartoons for variety and some sort of poorly-defined representativeness. But fortunately, there are still plenty of classics, not to mention immortally high-powered hilarity, in Volume 2 to make it an essential purchase for fans and collectors.

These classic Looney Tunes are the way cartoons ought to be.

2053854,5,B00020SK1Y,"I'm always afraid of sounding like a grumpy old man when I say they just don't make cartoons like when I was a kid.  Actually, the cartoons made when I was a kid were pretty lousy.  The ones I enjoyed were already twenty or more years old even in my elementary school years; I would be exposed to them only through repeats, primarily in the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show.  While there are certainly plenty of decent cartoons nowadays, there is something special about the Looney Tunes that have made them last through the ages.  The four disc Volume 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection provides sixty or so examples of this immortal animation.

The first disc features Bugs Bunny in various adventures and misadventures.  Bugs is the singlemost iconic figure in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies pantheon, and these are all good to great cartoons.  Bugs contends with his usual adversaries of Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam as well as witches, Dr. Jekyll, French chefs and a number of other one-time adversaries.  Although entertaining, to me, I still think the best discs in the set are still to follow.

Disc two features the Road Runner.  Actually, the principal character is that hard-luck scavenger, Wile E. Coyote.  Because the story is pretty much the same in all these cartoons, they tend to blend together, so it's hard to remember if a certain gag occurred in Beep Beep or in Ready Set Zoom, but that's okay.  This is fun stuff.  The commentary tracks advise us of some of the ""rules"" of these films, especially that the Road Runner should never leave the road and Wile E. Coyote should always be done in by his own actions (the Road Runner doesn't do anything more than occasionally startle his adversary).  And on this disc, the Road Runner cartoons are only the start; we also get some wonderful films featuring less frequently used characters:  Cheese Chasers and Mouse Wreckers invert some of the usual cat and mouse gags by featuring the persecuted Claude the Cat, who would rather be left alone than deal with a pair of mice out to drive him crazy.  The Dover Boys is also a gem that features some one-shot characters in a story that has its own unique look and feel; in fact, it was ""too"" unique and not very well-received by some of the Warner Brothers higher-ups.

Disc three features Sylvester and Tweety.  I've never been much of a fan of the Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, and while these cartoons aren't bad, the best ones on this disc actually feature other characters and are primarily directed by the wacky Bob Clampett.  The Great Piggy Bank Robbery has Daffy Duck dreaming of being Duck Twacy; Baby Bottleneck has Daffy and Porky Pig contending with distributing babies during a stork shortage; Duck Soup to Nuts spotlights the ""classic"" Daffy who is borderline insane as opposed to the angry, ambitious later version; and Porky in Wackyland is utterly bizarre and delightful.  This disc also has the unusual Old Glory, a serious Porky Pig cartoon that provides a patriotic six minute history of the United States.

The final disc features celebrity parodies and music.  While some of these cartoons are merely decent with a greater emphasis on music than humor, there are also some real great ones here:  Rhapsody Rabbit, Show Biz Bugs and Stage Door Cartoon are all standouts, and You Ought To Be In Pictures is a great mix of live action and animation.  The two all-time classics, however are One Froggy Evening and What's Opera, Doc?  One Froggy Evening is a little morality play about a greedy man who finds a frog that performs elaborate song-and-dance numbers, but only when no one (besides the man) is watching.  It's doubtful that any other character other than that frog has been able to achieve such fame based on so little screen time (only seven or so minutes).  What's Opera, Doc? is considered by some to be the best cartoon EVER.  It is the perfect blend of a so-called high art  (opera) and low art (cartoons).

All these cartoons, plus a lot of special features such as commentaries and rare footage, make this an exceptional package.  It would be hyperbole to say every one of these cartoons is great, but most of them are:  on individual merit, I'd say they are roughly 50% five-star, 40% four-star and 10% three-star material.  Overall, this is easily a five-star package.  There may be good and great cartoons nowadays, but these cartoons (generally fifty to seventy years old) still need to be seen.",1149811200,180,4448,4.763707571801566
2053855,4,B00020SK1Y,"America is a great country, ain't it, Doc? Where else do people pay a full price premium on a product that they really only want 25% of?

Alright, alright...perhaps dat ain't fair. Daffy, Porky and the rest of the gang have their moments. And some of the lesser known classics that feature none of the popular characters are ""nice to have"", but ain't ""need to have"".

But the Bugs Bunny shorts in this collection make it woith the dough and woith the 4 star rating. HIT THE BUY BUTTON, for sure, Doc.

It sure would be nice to be giving 5 stars to an all Bugs Bunny collection though. I mean why couldn't they sell the individual character collections separately. Rhetorical question, really. The answer is good old American capitalism. And us maroons keep buyin' 'em, so no point in complaining anymore.

If they release one collection on its own it should be the ""banned"" collection. This way those who might be offended don't have to purchase it. Here's the list of what us collectors would like to see, so please Mr. Warner, let us see 'em again:

Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt - Featuring a stereotypical Elmer Fudd trying to catch Bugs.

Bunker Hill Bunny - Bug's says, ""Your brother blows bubble gum.""

All This and Rabbit Stew - The only Bugs cartoon on the Censored Eleven, featuring a stereotype trying to catch Bugs.

Southern Fried Rabbit - Yosemite Sam is a Confederate with Bug's trying to cross the Mason/Dixon line as a stereotype.

Any Bonds Today? - Bugs Bunny and friends promote war bonds, with Bugs doing a Jolson impression.

Fresh Hare - A firing squad that turns ""into a stereotype"" at the end to sing along to Bugs' last wish of being in Dixie. Elmer and Bugs jump into snow drifts leaving silhouettes...one of Bug's silhouettes is a shapely woman.

Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips - One of the most infamous Bugs Bunny cartoons, with Bugs fighting stereotypes during World War II.

Herr Meets Hare - Bugs disguises himself as Hitler in the Black Forest.

Mississippi Hare - Cotton pickers mistake Bugs' tail for a ball of cotton and toss him in with the rest of the haul. On the riverboat Bugs takes on the gambler Colonel Shuffle.

Which is Witch? - A stereotypical witch doctor needs Bugs as an ingredient.

Bushy Hare - Featuring the stereotypical Aborigine ""Nature Boy"",...""UNGA BUNGA BUNGA INGA BINGA BINGA BUNGA!!!! What'd I say?! What'd I say?!""

Horse Hare - Yosemite Sam leads a Indian stereotypes to invade Bugs' fort.

A Feather In His Hare - Another American Indian stereotype trying to catch Bugs.",1148342400,8,2522,4.695454545454545

The first two discs contain a fair amount of BB, but they just aren't very funny. If you already have Volume I, skip II and pick-up Volume III instead.",1138579200,11,297,4.120689655172414

I do feel that I should defend their claim to being ""un-edited"" (as another reviewer brought it up regarding the cartoon ""Old Glory""). The words ""under God' were NOT part of the original Pledge of Allegiance. They were added in 1954. The cartoon in question is from 1939, well before the Pledge was, uh...

2053862,5,B00020SK1Y,"I say this, because this collection is a REAL blend of the Golden Age-from the late 30s to the late 50s.

Here are my given thoughts on the four discs with 15 shorts each.

Disc #1: Bugs Bunny- A great collection of Bugs shorts, like THE BIG SNOOZE, THE HECKLING HARE, LITTLE RED RIDING RABBIT, BABY BUGGY BUNNY, and the other two-thirds of the Bugs-and-Cecil Turtle trilogy. 9/10

Disc #2: Road Runner and Friends- This comedic duo is half better than Tweety and Sylvester, and I think it's because the gags come in at a much better timing, able to give us a few chuckles all around. Both the RR selection, and its ""and friends"" selection, including CHEESE CHASERS, THE DOVER BOYS (classic) is top-notch. 8.5/10

Disc #3: Tweety and Sylvester and Friends- To tell you the truth, I'm not a fan of Tweety-- well, all the Friz Freleng ones. I think those are mind-numbingly derivative; Tweety may be cute, but his character is stale enough to avoid the comedic punch. It would've been nice to get a few Bob Clampett Tweetys; he was much meaner then. At least the ""and Friends"" selection makes up for it: The serious Chuck Jones cartoon OLD GLORY, and 4 Bob Clampett gems: BABY BOTTTLENECK, THE GREAT PIGGY BANK ROBBERY, KITTY KORNERED, and the ultra-surreal PORKY IN WACKYLAND. Plus, the MAN FROM WACKYLAND: THE ART OF BOB CLAMPETT featurette is very interesting. (Want to see the Ren and Stimpy creator John K. himself?) 5.5/10

Disc #4:All Stars- The real deal here. This disc includes a few more Bob Clampett gems like THE HEP CAT, BOOK REVUE, and the Fantasia parody itself, A CORNY CONCERTO. Also it includes two of Chuck Jones's all-time best cartoons A FROGGY EVENING and WHAT'S OPERA, DOC?, as well as my three personal favorite ""musical"" cartoons, KATNIP KOLLEGE, I LOVE TO SINGA, and HAVE YOU GOT ANY CASTLES? (Completely uncut, too! Never saw the Town Crier scenes at all.) 10/10

Yes, there are a few duds, but it's still a great collection overall, compared to the first collection.",1136246400,9,1993,4.712643678160919
2053863,5,B00020SK1Y,"I don't know if Brian Duggins was trying to be funny or was actually being serious (scary thought), but the ""under god"" thing wasn't originally in the pledge of allegiance, written in 1892.  It got tacked on in 1954.  The cartoon Old Glory was made in 1939.  So, um, yeah.",1135987200,13,272,4.4
2053864,5,B00020SK1Y,"You can't please all the people but here is a suggestion to those with complaints. If you don't like it when they put too many cartoons of one charactor on one disc and you like them mixed up as I do, then buy a multi-disc dvd player and load several discs, then hit random play. Ta Da! I can't complain because I love 99% of these cartoons especially the Hollywood parodies. If you like Looney Tunes then you will enjoy this or any of the collections. These cartoons are for adults but children enjoy them too because the adult part is subtle. You have to pay attention to catch the comments. I hope we will also get the so-called banned ones. They are stereotypical and racist but that's life, and if we continue to edit out our history we will then be doomed to relive it. By the way the war time cartoons that poked fun at the Japanese and Germans were proper for their time because THEY WERE TRYING TO EXTERMINATE our parents and grandparents.",1134259200,5,948,4.392045454545454
2053865,4,B00020SK1Y,"Its been many many years since I've watched the looney tunes as part of my saturday morning cartoons.  Hearing that when they are (rarely) played on tv these days they are cut edited and hand picked to not ofend idiots who cannot find the channel change button... I figured I'd take the plunge and buy the DVD collection.

First things first, the way the cartoons are compiled is awful.  An entire disc of only road-runner?  Come on, I want to mix them up like they were played on tv because even though road-runner was one of my favorites I can't watch them back to back to back.

Variety in general is missing, in fact.  This volume is Bugs, road-runner, tweety, and some oddballs, and not much more.  No foghorn leghorn at all, taz, and so on.

This won't be a big deal once I have the other two volumes, but since they are taking such a scattered approach why not diversify?  If they are going to use such a limiting format then why not chronological and complete groups?  Feels like a failed compromise, and is dissapointing either way.

I see room for improvement in the menus, its not clear what all is on the disc.  Its also not clear what cartoon your looking at in the list, if its daffy or tweety, etc.

Now about the cartoons themselves (enough of the nit-picking), WOW!  Sound, color, and picture quality are just perfect.  This is not the Matrix with 5.1 surround and tens of millions spent on CGI, these are 40-70 year old cartoons, but you'd hardly know.  Just watch the 50th anniversary tv special from the 80's included on disc 3, they show clips of Heckling Hare that remind you just how in need of restoration those tv broadcasts were.  Color sound and picture quality in those clips were dismal compared to the rest of the dvd.

I'm sure glad to see these fine cartoons again, uncut and restored to thier proper glory!  I balked at the price, but I have no regrets at all and plan to buy the first and third volumes soon.  Almost every reviewer has had something to complain about, and all different.  That just goes to show that they could never hope to please us all, but they aren't doing to badly, either.",1134259200,9,2130,4.452196382428941
2053866,1,B00020SK1Y,"As much as I love Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies productions, I give this volume a take-no-prisoners rockbottom rating.  My profound disappointment with this set comes not from the selection [though some really should have been in the 1st volume], but with the fact that the audio tracks in ALL of the toons are speeded up - far out of pitch from the normal I've known from 40 years of TV reruns and videotapes.  This has rendered some of my nearest and dearest cartoons [which include most of this set!] completely unwatchable.  The very worst example was unfortunately a real find for me, a cartoon I hadn't seen in over 20 years, A Bird In A Guilty Cage [1951], in which Tweety Bird sounds like he's hopped up on drugs and the music zooms by at Warp 5 or something.  My supersharp ear for familiar sounds needed no confirmation, but this toon was shown on Boomerang and the difference in sound was night and day.  In some cartoons of the 1st volume the opening and closing themes were curiously SLOWER than normal yet the toons themselves were perfectly okay, but not these - the whole set from beginning to end was intolerable to my ears, and so the box is now sitting by itself in a corner.  I'd like to think this horrible development was some kind of manufacturing flaw - although affecting all four DVDs is stretching reason - but I'm not about to drop any money on a replacement set to find out [until the prices fall significantly]. It's no fluke, either, since classic TV shows on cable [e.g. TV Land], some of my other DVDs and plenty of music CDs have got a track speed problem as well - just not as bad as in THIS case.  I received the 3rd volume for a birthday gift today, and I braced myself for more audio horrors; but happily every one of the 60 toons in it both look and sound their best.  Hopefully all subsequent releases will be just as consistent - and even inclusive of the stupidly ""banned"" cartoons, since volume 3 states on the back ""for the adult collector.""  Warners might just yet have regained that wisdom for the future, and this dedicated fan of their superlative cartoons from the past will be greatly appreciative of it.",1132704000,18,2157,4.4961636828644505

2053868,4,B00020SK1Y,"America is a great country, ain't it, Doc? Where else do people pay a full price premium on a product that they really only want 25% of?

Alright, alright...perhaps dat ain't fair. Daffy, Porky and the rest of the gang have their moments. And some of the lesser known classics that feature none of the popular characters are ""nice to have"", but ain't ""need to have"".

But the Bugs Bunny shorts in this collection make it woith the dough and woith the 4 star rating. HIT THE BUY BUTTON, for sure, Doc.

It sure would be nice to be giving 5 stars to an all Bugs Bunny collection though. I mean why couldn't they sell the individual character collections separately. Rhetorical question, really. The answer is good old American capitalism. And us maroons keep buyin' 'em, so no point in complaining anymore.

If they release one collection on its own it should be the ""banned"" collection. This way those who might be offended don't have to purchase it. Here's the list of what us collectors would like to see, so please Mr. Warner, let us see 'em again:

Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt - Featuring a stereotypical Elmer Fudd trying to catch Bugs.

Bunker Hill Bunny - Bug's says, ""Your brother blows bubble gum.""

All This and Rabbit Stew - The only Bugs cartoon on the Censored Eleven, featuring a stereotype trying to catch Bugs.

Southern Fried Rabbit - Yosemite Sam is a Confederate with Bug's trying to cross the Mason/Dixon line as a stereotype.

Any Bonds Today? - Bugs Bunny and friends promote war bonds, with Bugs doing a Jolson impression.

Fresh Hare - A firing squad that turns ""into a stereotype"" at the end to sing along to Bugs' last wish of being in Dixie. Elmer and Bugs jump into snow drifts leaving silhouettes...one of Bug's silhouettes is a shapely woman.

Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips - One of the most infamous Bugs Bunny cartoons, with Bugs fighting stereotypes during World War II.

Herr Meets Hare - Bugs disguises himself as Hitler in the Black Forest.

Mississippi Hare - Cotton pickers mistake Bugs' tail for a ball of cotton and toss him in with the rest of the haul. On the riverboat Bugs takes on the gambler Colonel Shuffle.

Which is Witch? - A stereotypical witch doctor needs Bugs as an ingredient.

Bushy Hare - Featuring the stereotypical Aborigine ""Nature Boy"",...""UNGA BUNGA BUNGA INGA BINGA BINGA BUNGA!!!! What'd I say?! What'd I say?!""

Horse Hare - Yosemite Sam leads a Indian stereotypes to invade Bugs' fort.

A Feather In His Hare - Another American Indian stereotype trying to catch Bugs.",1131580800,7,2522,4.695454545454545
2053869,5,B00020SK1Y,"Bob or 'Robert Clampett' was the best Director/Animator cartoons have ever had, and to find out exactly why that is, see the documentary contained on this set (DISC 3). Just listen to the uncontained enjoyment in John Kricfalusi's commentary on 'The Great Piggy-bank Robbery'. Unfortunately we never saw most of these screened on television because they concentrated on the years after Bob Clampett had left the studio, thank god for DVDs, as now we can see what we missed out on!

These cartoons alone make the package worth its cost.

The hidden gem here, is, through no fault of its own, ""Orange Blossoms for Violet,"" a rare venture by Jones and Freleng into live action comedy, featuring animals of various kinds but focusing on monkeys.  Violet is the golden-wigged bride-to-be of a slightly dweebish simian named Fred, but not if the devious monkey Harvey has anything to do with it.  Harvey sounds a lot like Daffy Duck, but, and I swear I am not making this up, he looks EXACTLY like George W. Bush in his facial expressions.  You have to see this film to believe it, and you will find the resemblance hysterical.  My boyfriend and I did several screen captures and the ""Bushiness"" of each look on Harvey's face was uncanny.

Okay, I'll close this with a few wish list items for Volume 4 (I've already seen the list for Volume 3):

""I Wanna Play House"" - a late 30's Merrie Melodie about two playful young bears, one of whom unwittingly gets drunk and then sings a song which in hindsight is an unbelieveable choice for a little 1930's teddy bear - ""I've Gotta Sing 'Cause I'm Gay.""

""The Gay Anties"" - a turn-of-the-century picnic is turned topsy-turvy by some fun-loving ants.

""Rabbitson Crusoe"" - WHY WHY WHY haven't they included this one yet?  Bugs sings ""Secret Love"" and leaves Doris Day's version in the dust, in between aggravating Yosemite Sam on a pirate ship.

""Claws In the Lease"" - features the classic ""Pussykins Cat Food"" commercial.

""Jumpin' Jupiter"" - Porky the brave and Sylvester the cowardly venture into outer space.  The music soundtrack for this one ranks at the very top.",1130630400,5,1875,4.711656441717792
2053871,5,B00020SK1Y,"After the high standard of Vol 1 I was looking forward to this collection which does not disappoint at all.

 Disc 1 again features Bugs though including a few more earlier features. I really liked French Rarebit (he outwits two French chefs who want to cook him) and Broomstick Bunny (featuring Witch Hazel) but all the shorts have their moments.

Disc 2 Features Roadrunner cartoons in the main and although these are best watched one or two at a time they are FUNNY (Love that green batman suit scene). Also included aree some other catoons including the melodramaic the Dover Boys. and the great A Bear for Punishment (my Paw by Junyer Bear age 7 and a Half).

Disc 3 is mostly Tweey also good in small doses. and some really wacky earlier material.

Disc 4 contains some interesting early one offs as well as the well known One Froggy evening (brilliant) and the classy ( but funny) What's Opera Doc.

The menus don't show a still from each cartoon as you indicate and the drawings on them are pretty ordinary, Volume 1 was better in this regard. A shame considering the cartoons are so clear and bright.

2053874,2,B00020SK1Y,"There are two types of fans of a particular entertainment.  The one who grew up with the show and likes to watch it...and the one who goes to show conventions, stands in line for autographs and considers cosmetic surgery in order to look like a key character.  Unless you fall into the second category when it comes to watching the Looney Toons, this collection will fall short of your expectations.  Where the DVD manufacturer seems to be out of touch when compiling this collection is by forgetting how the Looney Toons fan grew up watching the show.  Throughout the years these cartoons were shown on TV in a mixed up, random way.  They were like a box of chocolates.  You never knew what you were going to get...but you knew it would be good. The show would start out with a good Bugs Bunny cartoon, go to a Hollywood parody cartoon, have a Pepe Lepew cartoon, a Daffy Duck,etc.  What made you enjoy them is that you didn't know what was coming next.  It also made you better able to sit through a cartoon you didn't like because you had hopes that one of your favorites would be coming up next.  When the maker of this collection compiled the DVDs they took away one of the key things that made us like the shows by putting all of a particular character on a disc...and not the most popular characters either. A whole disc of Sylvester and Tweety, a whole disc of Roadrunner, and a whole disc of Hollywood parodies.  For most fans of the show...these were the 'toons you just tolerated while waiting for Bugs Bunny or your other favorites. For me, sitting through a whole DVD of Roadrunner cartoons is akin to mental torture...even though I like the Looney Toons.  TV programmers knew about this...so they would mix up the cartoons. Also, its obvious that the manufacturer realized if they made another collection like the first one...filled with all excellent cartoons...the ones everyone wanted...they would soon run out of material.  This collection is padded with a lot of cartoons you wouldn't watch if they were to come on TV, and that weren't even popular when they were first released...yet you paid $50 for the privilege to watch them.  Who wants to watch a full disc of Hollywood parodies...full of references to Hollywood stars long forgotten about.  Even if all you watch is AMC, many of the gags in these cartoons will go over your head...not to mention your kid. You end up with only a handful of cartoons on this whole collection you'll want to watch more than once. The sad thing is that if they had mixed up the cartoons this collection may have worked for the reason I mentioned earlier.  The way it was compiled it just doesn't work for me. If you like the Looney Toons, but have no interest in naming your first born ""Tweety"", save your money and buy the first collection and stop.

2053878,3,B00020SK1Y,"This collection is not as wonderful, in my mind, as the first one but that is a hard standard to live up to. It is a great collection full of entertaining cartoons from yesteryear.

The collection consists of 4 disks. Each disk has a ""theme"" with 15 cartoons and a few extra features.

The first disk is dedicated to Bugs Bunny. All of the cartoons feature Bugs.

The second is dedicated to Road Runner. I was always a Road Runner fan but one of the things I learned with this disk is that Road Runner is best taken in smaller doses. Having this many in a row lowered the overall enjoyment factor.

The third ""features"" Tweety and Sylvester but it also involves a few of the others like Porky and Daffy. It is one of the best for variety.

The fourth and last is more difficult to quantify. It largely consists of cartoons that don't fit in with the main stable of characters. Some of these are shorts involving books in a library, fairy tales Hollywood actors and such and others are ""different"" for other reasons. For example, the final cartoon is one with Daffy and Porky but is primarily live action. The cartoon characters interact with the people of the Warner Studio and with a Hollywood lot. One of the best things about this disk is that it contains so many of Bob Clampett's pieces. He was the looniest of the loonies.

The ""Extra Features"" range from the very good to the inane. Some detail the work of people like Clampett and others are nothing more than hokey interviews with Hollywood stars talking about Bugs and company as if it were an expose. They will suit some and disappoint others.

It was also written somewhere in the reviews that ""One Froggy Evening"" was also on both -- wrong again fellas.

WB is smart. They are not going to release everything on these upcoming collections because they want us to buy their other remastered movies. For instance: If you want ""Yankee Doodle Bugs"" and ""Yankee Doodle Daffy"" you will have to buy ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" with James Cagney. Also, if you'd like ""Robin Hood Bugs"" and ""Robin Hood Daffy"" you will have to purchase ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn. Both are 2-disc sets and really worth the money if you like the classics. However, this is the only way to get all of the Looney Tunes', so far.

Of course, not everyone is going to be happy. I wish that WB had included ""A Hare Grows in Manhattan"" to either set. Also, why not more Daffy or Foghorn Leghorn? Maybe in the subsequent sets.

Otherwise, it was a wonderful collection. I wish one of these days, Warner Brothers would have every single cartoon ever made from 1930 to those cheesy late 1960's with Merlin the Magician, Roadrunner Coyote, etc all in a collection of about 5-10 volumes. I also had no idea that the 1930's non-Ted Turner Porky Pig cartoons were originally in black and white, because as a kid, they were colorized and in the early 1990's, colorized again. One more piece of nostalgia on here: the opening sequence of the Bugs Bunny Roadrunner show from the 1970's and early 1980's I grew up with.",1111449600,6,756,4.368794326241135
2053891,5,B00020SK1Y,"Before you buy this, know that What's Opera Doc is also strangley included with the ""Spotlight Collection Vol 2 and has many other repeats, including One Froggy Evening.  So, if you have Spotlight collection 2, you'll be disappointed with the Golden Collection, as you'll see many repeats on both DVD sets.

 Knowing that Volume 2 actually has some repeats from the first spotlight collection (not to be confused with the Golden Collection Volume 1)  so keep this in mind if you own Spotlight Collectoin 2 before buying Golden Colection 2. I also noticed a few bugs bunny ones and probably 5-7 repeats from Tweety/Sylvester taken directly from volume 1. Not sure what the deal is. I can only assume they ran out of cartoons? Which is crazy. But for the few repeats there are, this is a sweet collection. It includes one DVD with 80% Roadrunner VS Coyote although it's still missing several from that series, but definitely a good start until volume 3. A DVD full of Elmer VS Bugs from the 40's, 50's and 60's and some Daffy included too. The last disc is basic Warner Brothers Looney Cartoons without the main chracters, with a few throw ins from Porky Pig. Still more of the Hollywood parodies skits are also loaded in this collection and of course the Infamous What's Opera Doc is back for volume 2. Much of these toons are must haves and some of what the best has to offer. I still want more new ones from the 60's which were my favs growing up in the 70's on the Bugs Bunny Road Runner show, but we'll have to wait.

I did notice something that makes me mad! There are a few edits I noticed and the cartoon is not ""untouched"" or edited like Warner Brother Claims. I noticed a few cuts in the violence, whether it'd be guns, hammers, or what have you. But the most blatent cut is when Elmer is dreaming (within in the Big Snooze) and Bugs Bunny is shown taking a ""single sleeping pill"". A true fan who knows the cartoon and who owns the VHS tapes, knows that in the original Bugs guzzled and overdosed on an entire bottle of pills.  I hate the censored version. Why take away the original the way it was meant to be? I know it's to tone down the violence and ideas of drugs or what have you, but I want my cartoons how they used to be, not cut to be good for the kiddies! If your kids don't know better, than the should watch it when they know better! But with that, I'm done ripping it, because I'm still happy, I love Warner Brothers Cartoons and there will never be an era like that again. Cartoons stink now and this is quality entertainment at it's finest. The speech impaired characters will never be surpassed, and that's all folks.",1111017600,7,2642,4.414784394250513

2053893,5,B00020SK1Y,"Disney can rightfully lay claim to be king of golden age feature film animation, but when it comes to shorts the crown goes to Warner Brothers.  No other studio, including Disney, ever even came close.  With talents that included Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones, Mel Blanc, and Carl Stallings--to name but a few--Warner developed and refined a series of characters that have become fixtures in our cultural landscape: whether you mention names like Bugs Bunny or just simply refer to ""that singing frog,"" every one knows exactly what you're talking about.

This stunning eight disk collection includes both Looney Tunes Golden Collection sets--a total of eight DVDs packed with more than one hundred Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and more extras than you can shake a carrot at.  Although some may quibble that in some instances the title cards are not original to the first theatrical releases, the simple fact is that you haven't seen these films looking this good in a very, very long time.  The fuzziness and odd color values typically seen on television are gone; the Technicolor process is brought back to its full brilliance and with minor exceptions the prints are as pristine as any one could possibly wish.

The bonus material is almost overwhelming in abundance. Granted, a fair portion of the material is trivial in nature, but it is never less than entertaining, and now and then the package includes material that really does deserve the name ""bonus.""  The most significant items include ""The Boys From Termite Terrace,"" a 1970s documentary that outlines the history of the Warner Brothers animation department; ""Irreverent Imagination,"" a collection of interviews with surviving directors, animators, and voice artists; and too-short but extremely interesting hommages to Tex Avery, Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Mel Blanc, Carl Stallings, and many others.

It is true that the bulk of the material here draws upon the work of director Chuck Jones, and if you happen to prefer the work of other animation directors--Tex Avery is something of a cult figure--you may feel short-changed.  But this does not actually undercut the quality of the material that IS offered, and one can only hope that Warner Brothers will release other volumes to fill the gaps in the future.  As for this release itself, it's all memorable stuff, worth every penny you'll spend.

2053894,4,B00020SK1Y,"Although many of the true classics are included in the first two sets, I have to wonder how any compilation can be fully comprised without Ali Baba Bunny and Rabbit Hood?

Just as an example - After seeing entries like Dough for the Do-Do (Volume 1) (Who ever heard of this or much less would watch it???) and The Three Little Bops (Volume 2), I can't help but wonder why such good ones are omitted for the less favorable.

WB is omitting witty, ""punny"" and hysterical features for ones that were not even shown on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings when I was growing up.

In short, they are great collections, just lacking in completeness.",1109376000,4,647,4.608695652173913
2053895,3,B00020SK1Y,"Once again Warber Brothers has released a second volume of some of the best animated shorts ever produced.  They tout this collection as being restored, but it really is not completely restored.  Sure the colors look the best ever, but you are NOT seeing the entire original cartoon, and it is not due to censoring!

Every time you see an opening sequence with the ""blue ribbon"" title card, you are NOT seeing the original title/opening sequence.  Many of these cartoons were re-released in the 1950s and the original title sequences were removed, being replaced by the more generic blue ribbon title card.  Oftentimes this is sorely apparent as the Merry-Go-Round Broke Down song ends and it immediately breaks into a musical cue that obviously began earlier but is no longer there...it's like dropping the needle in the middle of a song on a record.  Even worse, these title cards replace all the screen credits...want to know who the director was, animators, and anyone else who worked on this particular short?  TOO BAD!!!

Those original sequences are out there, mostly in Warner's vaults and some in Eastman & Lib of Congress.  Sadly Warner Brothers did not take the time to search for many of them (at least they got the ""Book Revue"" title restored).  Simply watch disc 4 and see how many original title sequences are missing...

And the cropping of the image (my other HUGE gripe) is absolutely unacceptable.  Watch THE DOVER BOYS, listen for ""Unhand her Dan Backslide"".  Dan is lying on the floor but all you can see is the top of his shoe.  In the 16mm print I had several years ago, he is fully visible at the bottom of the image...SHAME on Warner for not windowboxing these.  How many times are the tops of heads cut off, sides of words missing, cast members at the far sides of frames cropped either partially or ENTIRELY...(watch HOLLLYWOOD REVUE).

Until they finally get it right (and they probably never will unless comeone like Criterion leases the cartoons from them and reissues them), I can only half-heartedly recommend this box set...and that is only becuase you cannot get these toons on DVD anywhere else.",1108512000,29,2130,4.81043956043956
2053896,5,B00020SK1Y,"They're great individually. This pair consists of two boxed sets, each with numerous and detailed reviews of its own (do product searches on B0000AYJXS and B00020SK1Y).

More is better. The first set is a fairly safe and predictable set of Looney Tunes - all good, but WB is saving a lot of the top favorites as reason to buy future sets. The second, likewise, has a few great favorites, but also reminds me that the ""lesser"" works are pretty darned good too. Both sets have roughly the same format: two Bugs-oriented disks, and two that emphasize other characters (8 discs total - a lot of watching). There's a mix of early and late material, enough to make character development quite visible. Also, the DVD extras are very worthwhile - not just a few stills from the `toons you 've already watched, but real features that add insight, or that are plain fun by themselves.

If you like the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, you are sure to like these. They set is on the pricey side, but bargain hunters can probably do well on the used market. The entertainment is all there, however you get to it, and is the kind worth watching more than once. I'm happy I have the whole set - or at least, the whole set so far.

2053897,5,B00020SK1Y,"Not for watching these `toons, at least. Bugs, Elmer, and all the rest are here. Rationed out a bit at a time, this collection can give weeks of pleasure - even before going back and starting the set again.

The first disc is classic Bugs, and the first `toon is a favorite of mine. 'Duck Amuck' a famous exercise in cartoon impossibilities, but the dream sequence in 'The Big Snooze' ranks right up there with it. Most of the second disc is Roadrunner and Wile E. That poor coyote is an ongoing object lesson for every engineer or engineer-to-be: no matter what you put together, it's going to find its own ways of failing. The last disc ends with 'What's Opera Doc', and 'You ought to be in pictures.' The first of those is Bugs and Elmer doing Wagner, just as well as you might have hoped. 'Pictures' is older and an oddity - it combines cartoon characters with live actors and scenes. Tastes jaded by Roger Rabbit may not appreciate it, but it was groundbreaking stuff at the time.

Normally, I don't pay much attention to DVD extras - I've been disappointed too many times. These discs tucked away some additional cartoons in the extras section. One was a real historical artifact, a public service piece about public health. I'm not quite sure what to make of it, except that it does capture a distinctive moment from around the early 50s.

Of course, this isn't back to back favorites. WB needs to space them out over the coming collections. That's fine, because I really enjoy a lot of the less famous `toons. Some of them show the cultural icons of their time, Bogart, Lorre, and the rest. Others are good ones that I had just forgotten, or sometimes never seen.

I grew up on these cartoons. Most of them predate me. They're nostalgia, they're history, and they're American culture, whether you want to admit it or not. Most of all, they're just fun.

And, it's a little luxurious to be able to watch one or two shorts before putting a feature movie in the DVD, kind of like having the theater to yourself.

Enjoy!

My only complaint is that it says the 1st Looney Tune ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"" is on Disc 4 & I can't find it on ANY of the disc.

2053900,4,B00020SK1Y,"This second volume of classic cartoons proves to be as much a delight to watch as the first volume.  It also provides an indication that Warner Brothers will continue to release many of its gems from the vaults in completely restored and uncut form.  In most cases, the colors are rich and vibrant like never before.  Like the first set, this collection is not comprehensive but goes a long way in helping Looney Tunes fans build their cartoon collection.  Hopefully, in time, completists like myself will be more satisfied.

Here are the best ones featured on Volume 2:

""Baby Bottleneck"" (A classic cartoon where Porky and Daffy are aids to the burned-out stork who delivers babies)

""The Big Snooze"" (A wild cartoon where Bugs invades Elmer's dreams to change his mind about tearing up his contract and breaking up the act; ""The rabbits are coming, Hooray, Hooray!!)

""Bunny Hugged"" (Bugs makes his professional wrestling debut as `The Terror' in an entertaining bout with `The Crusher')

""A Corny Concerto"" (Elmer as the conductor and M.C. introduces two hysterical, musical vignettes (sans dialogue) -- the first, involving Porky, the hunter, chasing Bugs, the second, a baby duckling attempting to join a group of swans)

""French Rarebit"" (Two French chefs from competing restaurants battle it out to feature Bugs on their menu, but wind up in the oven themselves; ""Personally, I prefer hamboiger."")

""From Duck Soup to Nuts"" (A sly, loony Daffy tries to outwit Porky, the duck hunter)

""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"" (A great cartoon with Daffy imagining himself as Dick Tracy (Duck Twacy) battling Tracy-like villains)

""Hare Brained Hypnotist"" (Elmer resorts to using hypnosis to try and catch Bugs, but to no avail.)

""Hare Conditioned"" (Bugs refuses to be stuffed and placed on display by a stubborn store manager; ""Kind of outsmarted you, eh, little chum?"")

""I Love to Singa"" (Mr. and Mrs. Owl's youngest fledgling is determined to sing Jazz rather than acceptable, less-rebellious music; a wonderful representative of the spirit behind Looney Tunes animation)

""Kitty Kornered"" (A hysterical short involving Porky battling his own cats who refuse to be put out for the night; ""It's uncatstituional!!!"")

""Little Red Riding Rabbit"" (A pristine version of a wartime classic where the big bad wolf wants to eat Bugs; adding to the fun is a Red Riding Hood who is a loud, overbearing, and intrusive bobby soxer; ""Hey, Grandma, I brought a little bunny rabbit for ya' ta haaave!!"")

""Mouse Wreckers"" (Two wandering mice, Hubie and Bertie, deciding they want to live in a certain, comfortable home, resort to building paranoia in a champion mouse-chaser cat in order to oust him from the premises)

""One Froggy Evening"" (An all-time favorite by Chuck Jones starring Michigan J. Frog - a true classic; ""Hello, my baby! Hello, my honey! ""Hello, my ragtime gal!!)

""Porky in Wackyland"" (The original, outrageous cartoon where Porky looks for the Do-Do bird; a color remake of this short is on Volume 1)

""Rhapsody Rabbit"" (Bugs, the pianist, does his best to perform live despite ""help"" from a spirited, musical mouse)

""Show Biz Bugs"" (Daffy refuses to be outdone on the stage by the star of the show, Bugs; he ultimately decides to blow himself up on stage; ""I know. I know.  But I can only do it once."")

""Slick Hare"" (A classic that involves Elmer, the waiter, trying to find Humphrey Bogart an order of fried rabbit with Bugs as the key ingredient)

""Snow Business"" (A hysterical cartoon that involves a snowbound Sylvester and Tweety; while Sylvester has definite plans to eat Tweety, a house mouse is desperate enough to eat Sylvester)

""The Three Little Bops"" (A Friz Freleng classic featuring Stan Freberg's vocals and pitting the three little pigs, a jazz trio, against a tone-deaf big bad wolf who wants to join their act)

""Tortoise Beats Hare"" (A Tex Avery classic where Bugs and Cecil Turtle meet and race for the first time; the sequel is on Volume 1)

""Tweetie Pie"" (A classic, early Tweety cartoon where Sylvester (named ""Thomas"" in this short) destroys his owner's house trying to eat Tweety despite the fact that the owner's broom keeps getting him in the end)

""You Ought To Be in Pictures"" (Daffy talks Porky into leaving Warner Brothers in this revolutionary cartoon involving live film coupling both human and cartoon characters)

""What's Opera, Doc?"" (One of the all time classics fully restored and uncut; ""Kill the rabbit! Kill the rabbit! Kill the rabbit!)

There are many other memorable cartoons included.  For example, disc two boasts a nice collection of Road Runner cartoons.  Sylvester and Tweety fans will be happy with disc three.  Throughout the set, important features such as alternate musical scores and commentaries enhance the viewability of many of the cartoons.  The 50th anniversary special is also included in this collection in two parts.

There are, of course, drawbacks to the set.  Clearly missing are ""Robin Hood Daffy"", ""Knighty Knight Bugs"", and other gems that include Daffy, Porky, and Yosemite Sam (characters clearly not featured as often in this set).  We should anticipate more appearances from them in subsequent volumes.  Furthermore, ""Sinkin' in the Bathtub"" (Bosko's debut), which is listed as a bonus feature in this set, is OMITTED.  The chapter menus on each of the discs are also designed a little differently than the first set - it's more difficult to determine which cartoon is which since the picture shown doesn't change when you highlight a cartoon title.

It's also important to note that the scaled down version with two discs is not as good an investment as the full four disc set.  Continue to buy the full collections as they are released by Warner Brothers to be more satisfied.",1105056000,32,5761,4.9958071278826
2053901,5,B00020SK1Y,"There is NOT a preview picture for each cartoon like there is in Volume 1.  For example, on each menu you may have say 5 or 6 cartoon titles to choose from.  In Volume 1, as you ""toggle"" to each cartoon title on the menu a thumbnail picture pops up on the right with a ""still"" from that particular cartoon.  (This is an awesome feature and makes it TONS easier to ID what cartoon it is. (Cartoon titles are very much alike)

  In Volume 2 this is not the case.  There are 2 ""stills"" which do not change, nor do you even know which of the 2 (out of say 6) tunes they even belong too.  In other words, the titles are not linked a still.

  This feature was really awesome and I can only hope that it was a fluke that it got left out in Volume 2.  PLEASE WB, put this feature back in for every tune in Volume 3!!!!

As for the rest, WB has done a fantastic job of restoration.  Great sound, saturation, no ""bugars"" etc..  Volume 1 was perfect, and this Volume could have been had they included the same preview feature.",1104969600,3,1016,4.086294416243655
2053902,3,B00020SK1Y,"I can't quite understand why seemingly nobody even mentiones the menu design on these disks. They're horrible from both an artistic and technical point of view. It's bad enough when they try to tease you with excerpts from the actual films on the menu stage. But in this case they tried to actually ""animate"" character poses isolated from pixellated film stills... Looks like the executive's brother-in-law took joined a two-hour Macromedia Flash-workshop.

It's incredible that Warner Brothers goes with something like this. They're disgracing their old masterpieces! Amazingly enough they're still capable of awesome animated film making if you look at The Iron Giant for example. I guess it's just another huge company with great departments over here and retarded departments back there.

Another issue already mentioned is the heavily cropped picture. It's a mistery to me why it would be necessary to get a crop not just on the left and the right side of the picture but in some cases also on the top and the bottom! For this kind of collection I'd expect a ""letterbox"" handling of the picture i.e. the use of black bars to horizontally fit the somewhat wider film picture in the squarish tv screen in order  not to lose any of the original image. What we got here is a truncation leading to misunderstandings (cropped off letters) and toned-down viewing pleasure (wild action gets unreadable or lost offscreen).

As a plus I would like to mention the numberous interesting commentaries that will provide you with quite an amount of deep insider information. It's just a shame you have to go back to the menu to switch them on for they're not listed as another audion track during playback.

The bottom line: I can recommend this collection... because there is no better alternative to watch and study these great cartoons.",1103846400,10,1829,4.9640522875816995
2053903,4,B00020SK1Y,"OK, let me quicky just echo what other former laserdisc owners have said across the web...oh how great it would be if Warners replicated the format of the old MGM/UA ""Golden Age of Looney Tunes"" boxed sets, now fetching top dollar on eBay.  Those sets had no extras, but they did have more sensible collections, with lots of rarely seen (and non-PC) shorts from the 30s and 40s.

Granted Warners now has access to all the shorts, not just the pre-1948 ones.  But c'mon...almost a whole disc of Road Runner?  A little of that goes a very long way.  I dunno--does anyone listen to audio commentaries of cartoons?  Or sound-effect only tracks?  Or documentaries with Cher talking about Bugs Bunny?  If you love extras, you'll love what Warners has done.  I, myself, would rather have had another 10 cartoons.

Alright, I'm done being a grouch.  This is what they have given us, and it is obviously a loving and professional package.  Most of the shorts look simply fantastic--especially ""Little Red Riding Rabbit"" (""....TO HAVE"").  It is also exciting to have ""Book Revue"" and ""Porky In Wacky Land"" and ""Have You Got Any Castles"" and ""You Ought To Be in Pictures.""  If you're like me and are craving the hard-to-find 1930s stuff--you'll be grateful for the ones that are on here (bless Warners for releasing them at all!), and will just wait patiently and hope the future volumes will have even more.

Just a heads-up: the fantastic Bugs Bunny cartoon ""Thugs With Dirty Mugs"" is being included as an extra on the upcoming DVD of ""The Roaring Twenties.""  Worth buying that disc for!",1103673600,10,1578,4.7463235294117645

I gave the set 5 stars, but I was disappointed in the packaging.  I had gotten Volume 1 when it came out and was expecting the same packaging for Volume 2.  My order wasn't coming and wasn't coming so I emailed Amazon who told me that I had to wait for the second printing because the demand for this set was so great.  Fair enough.  But when I received Volume 2 there was no cardboard wrap around inserted in a plastic sleave like Volume 1.  It looked like a boxed set but closer inspection revealed 5 individual keep cases held together with plastic tape. I like my box sets to be boxed.

I eventually went to a Wal-Mart and picked up a copy of the first printing.  If the packaging is important to you my advice would be to hold off buying this set from the internet and get to a store before all of the first printings are sold out.",1102636800,9,968,4.2228260869565215

The quality of the toons are superb -- for example, the color in One Froggy Evening was sharp and the sound was clear, just the best rendering I've seen of our good friend Michigan J. Frog.

I noticed that in both volumes, some cartoons have the heads, feet, or other parts of the picture edges cropped out which doesn't make any sense.  I'm not sure what they were trying to do, but it's annoying to me.  It only detracts a little from the presentation.  They're still as funny as ever.

I was hoping to see more Foghorn and Taz in vol 2.  I love Taz.  Two of my favorites aren't in either volume.  One is with Bugs and the two hillbillies where Bugs does the song calling.  Cracks me up!  The one with Foghorn has a scene with Barnyard dog where he's barking like crazy but is at the end of his rope and Foghorn tells him to shut up and slaps him.  Soooo funny.  Hopefully will be in vol 3.

All in all it's a great collection.  I love Little Red Riding Rabbit.  If you're a Roadrunner fan, there's quite a number of shorts.  I've forgotten how creative all the gags are.

I highly recommend both this and vol 1 and especially if you're a Loony Tunes/Merrie Mellodies fan.  The behind the scenes and commentaries really add to how these shorts came to life.  It's also cool to see the progression and development of the characters.  As a kid, I always wondered why sometimes Bugs looked/sounded different and the same for Elmer.",1102118400,6,1335,4.281124497991968

Both volumes offer four discs stuffed full of newly restored cartoons, well-researched documentaries, insightful commentaries and rare footage from the Warner Brothers vaults. Both are essential additions to any animation buff's collection. Unfortunately, the expensive restoration process translates to a higher-than-average price per disc. If you're making your purchase strictly based on the number of cartoons per box, you should know that there's 56 in volume one while volume two has 60 (not including the bonus cartoons in each volume).

Each volume devotes one entire disc to Bugs Bunny and divides the other three discs among his many co-stars. The first volume spotlights Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, while the second volume has a disc each for the Road Runner and Tweety & Sylvester cartoons. Discerning reviewers have noted that their favorite supporting characters have been neglected in favor of the better-known stars, but this is a minor problem that will be corrected with the release of the third box set next year.

If you're looking for DVD bonus material, the second volume offers an hour-long TV special with countless celebrity cameos and precious little cartoon footage. (The packaging promised a bonus cartoon from 1930, but it was missing from my copy.) Cartoon historians will prefer the first volume, which features three full-length documentaries along with a dozen brief mini-documentaries profiling the characters and the artists that created them. Both volumes feature dozens of bonus audio soundtracks, and listening to them all will keep you busy over the holidays.

Here's my general recommendation: the first volume is a great gift for older adults and serious cartoon fans; the second volume is best for younger children and casual fans. Either one will satisfy your need for a good laugh - and leave you wanting more.",1101600000,13,2259,5.064516129032258
2053911,5,B00020SK1Y,"One Froggy Evening, I Love to Sing-a and the Great Piggy Bank Robbery are among the gems in this feature-loaded collecton from Warner Bros. The last, Daffy Duck's most manic short subject, probably could have been brought up before the Decency League if more parents had wondered what kind of mind-altering drugs could have inspired it. It's as far out there as any mainstream cartoon I've ever seen. There's plenty more to distinguish this collection. I just wish Volume Three would contain more of the older Blue-Ribbon shorts -- ones that don't star the rabbit, the duck or the pig.",1101340800,2,585,4.86
2053912,3,B00020SK1Y,"Great selections yet some of the cartoons are zoom-ins of the originals. If you have some VHS copies of some of the musicals, this becomes obvious - how else can you explain cropped heads / feet and sides in some instances?",1100995200,15,223,4.463414634146342
2053913,4,B00020SK1Y,"There are just so many people that are really interested in older cartoons again, thanks to their release on DVD. Yet, it is just a shame that cartoons like The Flintstones, The Jetsons, and Johnny Quest aren't on television anymore, in place of more recent hits like Spongebob Squarepants and the animated revival of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Nevertheless, the classic animation is sometimes a whole lot better than what has to be hot right now. One classic case in point is the Looney Tunes cartoons from Warner Brothers. They really have proven to be one of the most influential cornerstones of animation ever. Yet, while many may have forgotten them, the feeling of their animation really goes on well.

The Looney Tunes: Golden Collection 1 & 2, is a double pack of both of the 4 disc DVD volumes of the classic Warner Brothers library. The whole package consists of over 110 deligthful cartoons from characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote & Road Runner and many more. The animation on all these cartoons has been remastered very well, except for a few cartoons that were musically remastered in the wrong key. There are just so many wonderful cartoons here, including the legendary cartoons What's Opera Doc?, Deduce You Say where Daffy plays a detective who goes up against The Shropshire Slasher, Whoa Be Gone!, the Bob Clampett masterpiece The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, A Broken Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales and many more cartoons here. The commentary and the bonus features on this collection really speak out extraordinarily well, with a lot of classic clips from legendary animators including the late Chuck Jones who sadly died in 2002, and the legendary Oscar-winning director Friz Freleng who died in 1995.

All in all, the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: 1 & 2 are a very well adjusted DVD combo collection of some of the greatest animation of all time. If you really want the looney experience set in, don't buy either of them, buy both of them at once. It is a wacky animated package, at a reasonable price. That's All Folks!!

This time, WB, included 60 animated shorts and tons of extras. Some of the favorites include: One Froggy Evening, What's Opera, Doc?,  The Dover Boys, Bear for Punishment, Corny Concerto and much, much more. The 4 disc set is divided into one disc for Bugs Bunny, 2nd disc for Road Runner/Coyote and Duffy Duck/Porky Pig shorts, 3rd disc is comprised of Tweety/Sylvester and more Duffy Duck/Porky Pig and lastly the 4th disc is called All Stars. This fourth disc was my favorite since it included some of the mentioned shorts like One Froggy Evening and What's Opera, Doc? along with Three Little Bops and my new favorite I Love to Singa.
The presentation is excellent for all of the shorts as WB remastered them for this DVD release. Some of the extras include audio commentary, music only tracks, voice only tracks and short documentaries called ""Behind the Tunes"". There are much more extras included in this set.
Some people will be dissapointed in this set does not contain shorts with Marvin, Taz, Speedy, Foghorn Leghorn and Pepe Leppew. My guess is that these shorts will be coming in future volumes.

2053915,5,B00020SK1Y,"If you loved the first Looney Tunes DVD set as much as I did, you'll flip over this one. The early (pre-Chuck Jones) Bugs Bunny is well-represented- a little less slick and a little more fiery. Road Runner and Tweety-Sylvester fans will find a big batch of each- the formula may be the same but Chuck and Friz knew how to make the chases different and clever. For me, though, the highlights are the Bob Clampett cartoons like ""Book Revue"", ""Baby Bottleneck"" and ""Great Piggy Bank Robbery""- pure animated insanity all (check out Daffy as Duck Twacy and Danny Kaye!). This set also includes the fabulous Disc 4, which will become legendary. What a great batch of Warner zaniness: the incomparable ""One Froggy Evening"", the one and only ""What's Opera Doc?"" in all its hot-pink and purple glory, the library to end all libraries in ""Book Revue"" and ""Have You Got Any Castles"", the inspired Tex Avery caricature fest ""Hollywood Steps Out""...even the animation-meets-live-action ""You Ought to Be in Pictures"", which inspired ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" 50 years later. The color quality, given the age of these (almost 70 in spots), is great. I liked the extra commentaries on the Clampett entries- he was truly a gag-a-second genius. There's also a golden-anniversary compilation show and two interesting shorts: Jones' ultra-earnest public health lesson ""So Much for So Little"" (an Oscar winner), which harks back to those not-so-thrilling classroom films you sat through in sixth grade, and a curious Freleng creation with live animals called ""Orange Blossoms for Violet"" (she's a monkey). Oh, yes- did I mention Chuck's old-school college-humor ""Dover Boys""? Or the great Stan Freberg-performed piggy-wiggy-boogie ""Three Little Bops""? How about Sylvester singing everything from opera to Spike Jones in ""Back Alley Oproar""? I'm telling you, I can't get enough of this. Introduce your kids and grandkids to the best of American animation...watch it as a big kid, like me, who still loves a good laugh...or become an animation scholar (Clampett's Bugs v. Chuck's Bugs v. Avery's Bugs). Looney Tunes- they're the grub-ba-ba-da-that's all folks!",1100649600,11,2137,5.179190751445087
2053916,4,B00020SK1Y,"Much has already been said about this collection.  The sellection of Bugs Bunny cartoons was excellent.  Disk #4 by itself makes this a worthwhile purchase.  I appreciated the inclusion of several older cartoons, which are not often seen on TV anymore.

2053928,4,B00020SK1Y,"I often see the feeling of old animation as a fantastic blueprint to what usually comes around in cartoons and flicks like Shrek. With animation from MGM, and Disney pulling very well with the wholesome humor to its longevity, Warner Brothers made the craziest humor of all animation available. During its classic era, Warner Brothers and their team of directors including Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, and the late Chuck Jones, put a whole lot more than just pen and paper to the mix, they created history. Since the recent release of the 2003 Looney Tunes Golden Collection, many people are rediscovering the feeling of old school animation, and its followup also fares best to its ability.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, contains 60 animated gems of restored animation from the classic vaults of Termite Terrace. The first disc, like the last volume reflects on Bugs Bunny. The first disc includes some wacky classics, all of them restrored and uncut with better remastered animation including cartoons like Broomstick Bunny, one of only 4 cartoons featuring Witch Hazel, Baby Buggy Bunny which including a scene that hasn't been seen on television in over a decade, as well as classics from the 40's like Slick Hare, Tortoise Beats Hare, one of very few cartoons Tex Avery directed with Bugs, and The Big Snooze, the final Bob Clampett cartoon with Warner Brothers. The animation is restored beautifully, without musical key problems that the previous volume had last year.

Discs 2 and 3 are assorted but mostly reflect on cartoons with Tweety & Sylvester and Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner. Disc 2 contains classic chases that the Chuck Jones created enemies have made classic including classics like Guided Muscle, Beep! Beep!, Whoa, Be Gone!, and Ready, Set, Zoom! The cartoons really on disc 2 are in order from earliest to most recent for the Coyote & Road Runner. Other assorted cartoons on disc 2 include classic Chuck Jones cartoons like Mouse Wreckers and Cheese Chasers with the little known mouse duo Hubie and Burtie, and The Dover Boys.

Disc 3, reflects on Tweety & Sylvester with classic cartoons that were restored on video a few years ago like Bad Ol' Putty Tat, the Oscar-Winning Tweetie Pie, Room & Bird, and the looney holiday classic, Gift Wrapped. Unlike focusing on one director, the third disc adds some great cartoons including Old Glory, a reflection on Porky who didn't understand history by Chuck Jones, and Bob Clampett classics including the wacky and wild The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, and Porky In Wackyland which was made into the Friz Freleng remake Dough For The Do-Do.

The final disc reflects classics of stage & screen including classics that came from all over including the Jazzy version of the Three Little Pigs, Three Little Bops, the ultimate one-toon wonder One Froggy Evening by Chuck Jones, as well as classics like You Ought To Be In Pictures and the legendary Chuck Jones masterpiece What's Opera Doc. The animation here is great and really follows up to dynamic heights and wonderful boldness in animation.

All in all, The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2, really lives beyond its previous volume with some magnificent cartoons that haven't seen the light of video shelves in years. This is truly a must have for anybody who wants to enjoy the looney experience. It is the top DVD collection of the year.

A disk dedicated to Yosemite Sam is a must.  As for the people complaining about the lack of Tex Avery I think that they have their cartoons mixed up.  Yes, Tex did do great things for Warner Bros. but he really hit his stride when he was working for MGM--so if you want Droopy then start looking under an MGM title not a Warner Bros. title.  All in all I would say that this set is a must get for any Looney Toons fan.",1100476800,2,563,4.185185185185185

Come on WB, there are still 35 of my favorite Bugs cartoons that you haven't put in the Golden Collection yet that are worthy. I would appreciate it if you could put at least 12-15 (more would be even better) of the following into Volume 3:

I haven't gotten to the second volume yet, only because i'm still on the first... and i only got the package from Amazon.com about 4 days ago. It's insane. All the great memories, all the great laughs, and all the great characters intertwined into this little bundle for a super low price. The best price i've seen so far. I've actually calculated the prices of a lot of stores.. including ebay... all retailing around $120 for both volumes. Do the math. I still have the looney tunes tapes my father used to tape for me back in the 80s.. only problem is that it gets a little distorted and he cut out all the ""heavy"" scenes.. like the goldfish drinking poison after getting a big smooch from the large russian bunny-boo.

2053933,5,B00020SK1Y,"Warner Bros. has in my opinion done the best job of any major movie studio in opening up their vaults and providing good value for their DVD's.  Witness their editions of Casablanca, Singin in the Rain, etc.

Looney Tunes is no exception.  The cartoons on both Golden Collections look fresh and vibrant, and the humor and style of the cartoons beat the h*ll out of any of the dreck that passes as cartoons these days.  The extras that are included along with the cartoons provide additional insight as well.  I've learned more about the history of Looney Tunes in the few short hours I've spent watching these discs than in the many years since I first started watching LT as a kid in the early 70's.  It's been enough to inspire me to go find a book about LT so I can learn even more.

Looney Tunes have such a large and diverse fan base that it would be virtually impossible for WB to please everyone with just the relatively small percentage of cartoons that have been released thus far, but they are off to a great start!  Keep 'em coming, and if I may include my own suggestions for Volume 3, please consider Robin Hood Daffy (my personal favorite LT) and a disc devoted to Foghorn Leghorn.",1100131200,4,1195,4.4495412844036695

However, Volume #2 not only is as impressive as the first volume, but most likely is EVEN BETTER!

Disc One features incredibly indelible Bugs Bunny classics. Starting off with THE BIG SNOOZE (a surrealistic gem worth of Dali) and getting better from there...,, you're set. Disc 2 extolls the virtues of WILE E. COYOTE and the pesky bird who always caused him angst, as well as some Chuck Jones favorites.

Disc Three is devoted to Tweety & Sylvester. Worldwide favorites, with their Oscar-winning TWEETIE PIE leading into a series of amazing PORKY & DAFFY trips like Clampett's amazing BABY BOTTLENECK or the astounding PORKY IN WACKYLAND,

Then you get to Disc Four, where any serious WB animation devotee can have a DVD change-of-life. My God! Glowing restored TECHNICOLOR prints, uncut of such gems as WHAT'S OPERA, DOC. I LOVE TO SINGA, RHAPSODY RABBIT, HAVE YOU GOT ANY CASTLES (with the footage unseen since 1938), and even the perennial ONE FROGGY EVENING. How could anyone not love this? It's amazing.

* - as yet unconfirmed as going on this particular DVD in the set

** - probably will be on this disc

I would like to see more black & white Porky Pig Cartoons on the next set, because those shorts really exemplify Bob Clampett's genius. I also have another suggestion for Warner Brothers. Instead of including 16 shorts on each disc, how about lets boost it up to thirty or forty shorts on each disc, because 16 is just not enough in my opinion; not that it counts or anything, but I think I speak for everybody when I request more shorts on these discs.",1099699200,14,7047,5.152482269503546
2053949,5,B00020SK1Y,"Wow!  This is even better than the first set.  This one includes the best cartoon of all time, ""What's Opera, Doc?"" (according to Jerry Beck) as well as my all time favorite, ""One Froggy Evening"".  Lots of great old ones.  What is best about this collection is that the cartoons are more musical, more zany, and yes, older, than the perhaps more popular cartoons in the first collection.  This could be because they include more toons by director Bob Clampett, who had a distinctive fluid, hip, off-the-wall style.

 Most of the later ones from the fifties are directed by Chuck Jones.  His roadrunner cartoons have their own disc here, and his finest cartoon, ""What's Opera, Doc?"" has several music and dialogue rehearsal tracks on it that are a blast to listen to, as well as a commentary track.  There are several other cartoons with separate audio tracks as well.

  I had a hard time deciding what aspect of the collection is the best.  I'd have to say the quality, specifically the picture quality.  If you love Looney Tunes but have never seen these cartoons in these collections before, you are missing out.  It is like watching the actual cell and background art come to life.

  The WB studio is planning on releasing more of these collections, and perhaps they will keep going until they have released every cartoon.  But this is highly unlikely unless these collections sell well.  Support this effort by purchasing this collection.  It's a bargain when you add up all the running time on these discs.  More than highly recommended.",1099699200,3,1544,4.7908745247148286
2053950,5,B00020SK1Y,Brilliant job WB.... But where oh where is HILLBILLY HARE??? One of the funniest cartoons I've ever seen. Also more Foghor Leghorn needed. And where's MOUSE WRECKERS and poor old Claude the cat??? Come on release more Looney Tunes!,1099699200,2,231,4.948717948717949
2053951,5,B00020SK1Y,"This is a great effort by Warner Bros. to give us another satisfying helping of their classic ""Looney Tunes"" shorts.  60 cartoons are presented in this volume, not 56 like the first one.  Several of the more popular tunes that were not included in the first collection are present here (""What's Opera, Doc?"", ""One Froggy Evening"" and ""I Love to Singa"" among the most notable), and all of these cartoons are worth having at such a reasonable price level.  Like the first set, the tunes look cleaner and brighter than than they do on television.  Also, once again they are presented in their original uncut format.  Anything otherwise would of course be unexcusable.  I was also pleased to see that the shorts that were originally black and white are presented in that manner here as well, not as the colorized versions now shown on television channels such as Boomerang.  Some of the tunes do exhibit minor glitches (speckles, ""flickering"" colors, etc.), but they look pretty good for films that are anywhere from 50-70+ years old.  Plus, they will last forever in this format with no further deterioration.  They are definitely the best transfers that money can buy.

There are only a couple of complaints I have this time around, the first one being the fact that each tune does not have it's own picture on the short selection menus as they did the first time.  Sometimes I don't recognize the tunes based on their titles, but when I would highlight them and the picture would pop-up, I would often recognize that immediately and say to myself ""Oh yeah!  THAT one!""  I guess they had to omit that feature to fit the 15th tune on each disc as opposed to the 14 per disc on the first collection.  Whatever the case, I miss that feature and wish it would be re-instated for future collections if possible.

My other complaint (which has nothing to do with the quality of this volume) is the slowness with which Warner is putting these out.  With studio output of over 1,000 cartoons and at the rate of 56-60 per year as it has been thus far, I will be nearly 50 years old before I will have the entire library of ""Looney Tunes"" in my collection.  Put some more people on this project, guys!  At least try to get us TWO collections per year!  I want to still be able to see my television clearly to watch the tunes!  :)

In summary, anyone who loves these good old classics can't miss with this set.  It needs to be supported if we want Warner to continue mining these gems and put out further collections, so go out and pick yours up right away!",1099612800,65,2544,4.532894736842105
2053952,4,B00020SK1Y,these cartoons have not been restored. The other Amazon product Classic Cartoons  (B00063QD6G) is cheaper and has been restored without the problems that you see in these. The colors are also more vivid. Take a look at the other ones. I have a large collection of cartoons and if you want a good value check out the ones that I have noted here. I just wish that they(Starling Films) offered more of these.,1099612800,2,405,4.5479452054794525
2053953,5,B00020SK1Y,"Warner Brothers has done it again. They've put out a second awesome collection of classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. And this is perhaps even better than the first. I must admit, I'm biased in my opinion as this set includes my favorite Looney Tune, ""What's Opera Doc?"" But add other classics like ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery,"" ""Porky in Wackyland,"" and ""You Ought to be in Pictures,"" and you've got a truly classic set. These shorts look the best I've ever seen them, with bright, vibrant colors. Sure there are some dust specs, but remember that these shorts are 50-60 years old at this point. And  yes, there are more shorts I would have liked to have seen on this set, but they have to save something for future releases. Oh yeah, there's also some great extra features including the very odd and amusing ""Orange Blossoms for Violet."" In short, this is a great set. Any fan of classic catoons should own it!",1099612800,5,927,4.618181818181818
2053954,5,B00020SK1Y,"I've read several of the other reviews and I agree that a lack of Foghorn Leghorn is a travesty, and there isn't enough of Yosemite Sam, or Marvin Martian either.  That being said, in my humble opinion, the lack of Hillbilly Hare (the Bugs Bunny square dance cartoon w/ the two southern hillbillies)is the biggest gaping hole in this set or in volume 1.  I can't believe no one else on this site has pointed this out as of yet. Hopefully it isn't missing due to P.C. concerns.  If it is, then an ACME anvil needs to be dropped on Warner Brother's execs to knock some sense into them.  Or better yet, run all the WB execs through a hay baler (a hillbilly hare tribute for the uninformed). My neck is a little red myself and I'm certainly not offended by this classic toon, and I've never talked or heard of anyone who has been. But I've read of rumblings on the net about PC concerns.  Hopefully they are just saving it for Volume 3.  This set is still most definitely worth a purchase, with the two highest profile toons being the gem What's Opera Doc, and One Froggy Evening, with the Hello ma baby operatic frog.  Both classics, and too many other classics and near classics to mention.  Buy it, and don't skimp on the trimmed down cheaper version.  What's the point?  You won't miss the extra $15.  Just go without food for a day.  We all need to shed a few pounds. Anyhoo, I haven't seen all the extras, yet, but I'm sure they'll have some points of interest.  Oh, and thanks for all the Road Runner cartoons on Vol 2.  They never get old, and they were sorely missed on Vol 1 (only one of them on that set).",1099440000,15,1612,4.2947019867549665
2053955,5,B00020SK1Y,"Volume 2 is fantastic! The day that I got this treasure in my hands, I viewed almost 50% of the 60 animation shorts.  Don't try this at home 'cause this collection is even loonier than the first!  So far, my favorite disk is number four: Looney Tunes All Stars.  Surprisingly, I really enjoy ""Katnip Kollege"" (1938) and ""The Three Little Bops"" (1957) - both for its musical and artistic creativity.  ""Cheese Chaser"" (1951) on disk two is absolutely hilarious!  Poor cat!  This collection is sheer looney fun! The restored colors with Dolby mono audio tracks are very well done. No, the picture restoration is not THX quality, but this does not bother me at all. The animations on the DVDs look wonderful and fresh.  I would add that I am a little disappointed that cartoon shorts of Marvin the Martian are missing in this volume.  Nonetheless, this volume is worth every penny and a must buy for people of all ages who seek the acme of cartoon entertainment!  I look forward to future releases. Kudos to Warner Bros. Studios!",1099440000,6,1025,4.681564245810056
2053956,3,B00020SK1Y,"...I have just watched disc four (the one with ""What's Opera, Doc?"") and I am applalled at the low quality of the prints: speckles, dirt, scratches have been retained when it would have been relatively easy to remove them. Too bad.",1099440000,5,231,4.658536585365853
2053967,4,B00020SK1Y,"From 1940 to 1964, there were 168 Bugs Bunny theatrical cartoons.  So far, by purchasing both of the Golden Collections Vol 1 & 2, you can finally own about 40 of them on DVD.  Of course you get Daffy, Tweety, Road Runner, and the rest of great Looney tunes characters.  The extras are good, but are generally boring to a child.  If you're a parent and would like to give your children an idea of what cartoons should really be like, this is the way to do it.  Honestly, Pokemon and Dragonball Z wouldn't stand a chance against the wit and creativity of a fur-bearing, carrot-munching critter.  But if you're looking to own all of the Bugs Bunny cartoons on DVD, it's going to take about six more of these Golden Collections to be released.  So in 2010, we'll all be happy and content in our stack of Looney Tunes, hoping against all odds that a new video format doesn't come along and make our DVD players obsolete.",1099353600,4,916,4.416666666666667
2053968,5,B00020SK1Y,"So What's in the box doc? A whole bunch of classic cartoons get lovingly remastered with lots of very cool features. ""Looney Tunes-Golden Collection, Volume Two"" is missing some key cartoons (most notably a bevy of Daffy Duck cartoons) but the selections are all really, really entertaining and quite strong. We also get a number of exceptional featurettes including two on classic Jones cartoons included in this collection. ""It Happened One Night: The Story Behind One Froggy Evening"" and ""Wagnerian Wabbit: The Making of What's Opera, Doc?"" provides background on the inspiration behind these two classic cartoons devised by Jones and his favorite writer Michael Maltese.

The cartoons are broken up into four groups. Bugs gets disc one with such classics as ""The Big Snooze"", ""Broomstick Bunny"" and ""Tortoise Beats Hare"". Disc two focuses on Road Runner & Coyote and includes ""Beep Beep"", ""There They Go-Go-Go"", ""Bear for Punishment"" among many others. Disc three focuses on Tweety, Sylvester and a couple of Porky and Daffy cartoons. Included are Friz Freleng's classics ""Bad Ol' Putty Tat"", ""Tweet Tweet Tweet"". Most important for me one of my favorite cartoons ""Porky in Wackyland"" is presented on disc three in glorious black and white! Disc four is an all-star disc full of Hollywood parodies and one shot classics like ""What's Opera Doc?"" and ""One Froggy Evening"".

Included in the package are bridging segments from the old black and white ""Bugs Bunny"" cartoons that ran on ABC in the early 60's. part of these are in black and white and part in color as some of the surviving prints were discovered in the vault at Warner Brothers. There's also the ""Looney Tunes All-Star 50th Anniversary Special"" broken up over two discs. The pilot for ""The Adventures of the Road Runner"" shows up as well. ""Crash! Bang! Boom"" is a featurette devoted to sound effects man Treg Brown. There's also opening segments from the various incarnations of the Looney Tunes Saturday morning shows

We also get a great featurette (drawn from an older documentary)on Tex Avery. Avery is interviewed about his years in Termite Terrace. He discusses some of his classic cartoons (including clips from cartoons not in this collection)and the beginning of two fine animators that worked for him named...Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett. It's a great tribute to Avery one of the looniest directors that worked for the unit during the 40's. Finally, we get a new cartoon ""Daffy Duck for President"" that's actually well timed and pretty good.

There are 30 commentary tracks and also isolated music/sound effects tracks for many of the cartoons included. The image and sound quality is actually an improvement over the first set (which looked really good) for the most part. There's less dirt and hair artifacts visible throughout most of these classic cartoons.

Be aware that 30 of these classics (and it's stated on the packaging on the back here just like it was disclosed on the first set) on the ""Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 2"". If you're uncertain about this set or just want a couple of classics included on that set that are also included here, I'd go for the less expensive set. Otherwise, if you must have everything here (including all the tasty extras), by all means pick this great set up today!",1099353600,17,3296,4.985454545454545
2053969,5,B00020SK1Y,"I have to admit, when it comes to the Golden Collection series, someone at Warner Brother's is thinkin'. Yes, there is a lack of Foghorn Leghorn's and a very high margin of Tweety's, however, all the episodes are the older/better animated versions. What I especially appreciate is they brought out the older Daffy Duck cartoons where he is totally insane and spits all over the place. Another great point regarding Volume II is the inclusion of two, yes TWO Claude Cats (a relatively ignored character)in ""Mouse Wreckers"" and the very rare ""Cheese Chasers"". I am hoping that Volume III will include the one where the dog cons people out of meat using Claude--""What? No gwavy?""

I was very pleased to find my personal favorites, ""One Froggy Evening"", ""A Bear for Punishment"", ""Bunny Hugged"" and ""Corny Concerto"". There are several older cartoons from the black and white era as well as a few Tex Averys (which are fun)and a full section of Road Runners. Enough goodies to keep me happy until the next volume of fun. Keep it up WB!",1099353600,9,1029,4.748603351955308
2053970,5,B00020SK1Y,"Although I too sorely miss Foghorn Leghorn's presence on this set, I must admit that it is still an outstanding collection, and well worth the price.  Hopefully there will be a Foghorn disc on volume 3.",1099353600,2,202,4.611111111111111
2053971,3,B00020SK1Y,"I admire these shorts BUT - is there anyone else out there that is still missing some of the best Bugs Bunny cartoons?  I would think shorts such as (Pardon my ignorance -I do not know the actual names of the shorts):

* Robin Hood Daffy (Yikes & AWAY!)

* The Bugs with the vampire - (Pocus-cadabra)

* Bugs and Mugsy (I don't know how yous done it - but I know yous done it!!)

Leave it to WB, because I was able to get V.2 a little early and spent most of the weekend with it. The outstanding quality and extras of the first disc are equalled here, but the cartoons are even better. There are more of the earlier classics here including such unbridled masterpieces as

I think Bugs Bunny is possibly the greatest entertainer in history . I do not feel the same way about Tweety and The Road Runner . I would have been perfectly happy to have had the first volume be ALL Bugs . But i must admit as a first volume it was a wonderful cross-section of Looney Tunes ( Foghorn, Speedy, Pepe ), plus Daffy may be the second greatest entertainer in history .

I am however dissapointed at being forced to pay 45 dollars for 22 road runner and tweety cartoons on this second set . Bugs warrants his own set . If you are a fanatic , you will have spent 100 dollars and still not own :

Super Rabbit , Hare Tonic ( Rabbititus ) , A Hare Grows In Manhattan ( Bugs legendary rendition of "" The Daughter Of Rosie O'Grady ) , Rabbit Punch ( Boxing Motif ...The champ is groggy ...The Champ Is Down ) , Rebel Rabbit ( Bugs is Upset by rabbits only fetching a two cent bounty ) . Bowery Bugs ( Bugs sells The Brooklyn Bridge after recounting the tale of Steve Brodie ..a down on his luck gambler ) , The Grey Hounded Hare ( Bugs stumbles into the Greyhound Track ) , Southern Fried Rabbit ( Bugs is driven south by the great carrot famine and finds Rebel soldier sam not realizing the civil war is over ) , and of course the oft-mentioned Ali Baba Bunny ( HASSAN CHOP ) , plus too many more to mention !!!!

Finally its a complete travesty that Warner Brothers has released "" 8 Ball Bunny"" ( Bugs and a penguin head for the south pole ) ONLY as a bonus feature on "" The Treasure Of Sierra Madre "" ...

cmon Warner Brothers ....Bugs should stand on his own ... that being said ...of course ill still have it on release date ...

Also, the absolute worst would be for WB to release shorts with stupid politically correct commentary, like Disney did with recent releases of some of its cartoons from the 30's and 40's...I mean really, are we really so afraid of ourselves now that we can't appreciate a WWII-era cartoon caricature of a ""jap"" or a ""hun""?

-Beanstalk Bunny
-Ali Baba Bunny
-Transylvania 6-5000
-Robin Hood Daffy

-The 'Mother-In-Law' cartoons, I don't remember the names, but there was 'House of the future' 'Car of the future' etc. These were great! (Oh God, these aren't from ""Droopy"", are they??)

-""I Gopher You"" with Mac and Tosh the gophers (Thank You Amazon reader Tom for giving me the info on this one!!!)

2053983,4,B00020SK1Y,"For all those eagerly awaiting the next wave of classic cartoons from the Warner vaults, ""Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Vol. Two"" will represent something of a strange dichotomy between absolute elation and bitter disappointment. Yes, this box set does contain the prerequisite cavalcade of Bugs Bunny classics, including ""What's Opera Doc?"" and ""Broomstick Bunny"", as well as the much beloved ""One Froggy Evening"" which, thanks to the WB network, has made Michigan J. one of the most cherished frogs in film history. Eat your heart out Kermit! But the real shock and dismay on this 4 disc collectable set (featuring 60 classic cartoons) is that the studio has chosen to stock pile discs 2-3 with Road Runner and Tweety/Sylvester shorts at the expense of short ordering other classic characters out of the spotlight. Where's Charlie Dog or Speedy Gonzales or Foghorn Leghorn or Pepe LePew? Yes, you will get glimmers of these fellow crazies on disc 4 - that's for certain. However, as with the previously issued box, these merry mishaps only come to life in the briefest of fits and sparks. We only get to see bits and pieces of the rest of the gang instead of being inundated with a barrage of butt-wacking, brain-beating hilarity.

As with the previous box set, all 60 shorts on this occasion have been restored and remastered with varying degrees of success. For the most part, colors are rich and vibrant. Most of the shorts appear remarkably clean and free of age related artifacts. However, some of the short still have a considerable amount of edge enhancement in addition to age related dirt and scratches. Thus, the overall quality of the shorts is inconsistently rendered. The audio for all is mono but nicely balanced. Each disc comes with a cavalcade of bonus materials; no less than 30 commentaries, 9 featurettes and 2 full fledged documentaries.  There's also some isolated musical scores to indulge in and a few surprises that will be disclosed once you have this hot little stocking stuffer in the palm of your hands.",1098489600,15,2036,4.932944606413995
2053984,3,B00020SK1Y,"I would love to see some disks of the stars that only made a few toons. Like Sniffles (Some other connoisseur also mentioned him in another post), Quentin Quail and the 3 Bears. I love the 3 Bears when the wife always whines ""But HENRY"" :) Claude the Cat and the puppy who scares him all the time (what was his name?), Charlie the Dog. My favorites Marc Antony and Pussyfoot (the bulldog and the kitten). Ralph Wolf and Sam the Sheepdog. The young Ralph Phillips from Boyhood Daze. Chuck Jones is a Comedy God.

2053985,5,B00020SK1Y,"Now that we have volume 2 coming out with What's Opera Doc we should have most of the fans somewhat more happy.  However...I would like to request for vol. 3...Ms. Glory, Green Fedora...any and all of the Sniffles cartoons...Gremlins from the Kremlin (one of the most offbeat WW2 related cartoons)...and how about some of those controversial cartoons that we don't see on TV anymore.",1097971200,4,383,4.984375
2053986,4,B00020SK1Y,"I remember as a young boy those special occasions where I woke up on Saturday morning at my Grandparents home (who had cable) and we got to see hours of the best cartoons ever made. They were all made by WB. What was odd was that each year that passed cartoons got less intelligent and less funny. Later in life I realized that it was not because I was getting older and didn't appreciate cartoons as much anymore, but that intelligent cartoon markers are really rare and were dwindling.

WB has sunk way down in quality in their cartoons! If you have ever seen new attempts that they have made at recapturing the humor of their old cartoons, you might agree that there recent efforts (the last 20 years) is an abomination to their earlier work.

The problem is that the decision makers and the writers of today (especially from WB) don't even know what made the earlier cartoons - not just hilarious - but priceless!

Good humor comes from the irony of life, not slapstick. Combine the two, sure, but the slapstick doesn't work on it's own (unless you're stupid).

The old WB cartoons focused on the ridiculous quarks of the characters. If you go back and watch some really old ones you will notice the characters constantly debating with themselves whilst they play their parts. Mal Blank was obviously huge in bringing these characters to life! Now a days, writers try to replicate the humor of yesterday by repeating the obvious slapstick line/action that the infamous character used to say or do but they have but not a clue as to what made the scene funny in the first place!

Personally, I think if you liked the Road Runner shorts you missed it entirely! Please go and watch some of the stupid cartoons they make today. Those were the only WB shorts that missed the mark. And what floors me is when I ask someone that I am getting to know, ""Did you like the old WB cartoons?"" and they answer ""Oh ya, especially the Road Runner/Coyote ones"". Instantly I realize that this person doesn't get things!

Anyway, my plea to WB is ""Please include lots of the really early shorts in your upcoming volumes, even stuff with Bosco.""

I wonder if you agree with me...?",1097971200,4,2164,4.561855670103093
2053987,5,B00020SK1Y,"The marketing rep said last year defending the omission of ""What's Opera Doc?"" and ""One Froggy Evening"" from the first volume is that if they had all the best cartoons on the first set what will they do for an encore? Well, even without these two classics this set would still stand up as a great sequel to the first volume (Which was just as good despite the pedantic naysayers.)

Here some of the reasons why this set is worth your money;

First off the restoration job is just like the first set and it is all uncut, so the addition of all the material which Cartoon Network might deem improper for your child is included, but let's look at some of the best toons...

Porky in Wackyland
Great to see that they aren't afraid to stick a black and white cartoon in there especially this great surreal classic which introduced the Dodo bird.

The Dover Boys
The cartoon that introduced smear animation that was despised by the studio producers but is now used in practically all television animation. Especially Cartoon Network.

You Ought to Be in Pictures
Great one that has Daffy and Porky interacting with real people. The funny thing is the real people aren't actors. They were all workers at Termite Terrace.

Three Little Bops
Friz Freleng finally let loose a little with this highly creative swinging take of the three little pigs. I haven't seen this one in ages, it's practically Freleng's best work.

A Corny Concerto
Great parody on Disney's Fantasia by Bob Clampett. This set really pays tribute to him.

Of course that's barely even the tip of the iceberg of the quality of this set. All those Road Runner and Sylvester and Tweety cartoons might put some people off but I can't see why you shouldn't get this set if you aren't a fan... Unless you're broke I guess...

POST-THOUGHTS;
After seen the set I can say that Warner Bros. is very brave for including shorts like Have You Got Any Castles uncut. I thank them for that and I'd like to add that disc 4 is the best disc on the set with disc 1 in second place. Other highlights include; Ren And Stimpy creator, John K's commentary on The Great Piggy Bank Robbery, a dead-serious patriotic short by Chuck Jones called Old Glory and the cartoon that got Tex Avery fired; Heckling Hare. I'd also like to reiterate, these shorts are uncut and exactly how they were when they were released with the exception of the blue ribbon title cards. The abrupt ending to Heckling Hare was how that short was originally released and the footage that was meant to be there was gone because the studios didn't like it and this of course angered Tex Avery. So in case anyone was suspicious about that there's the explanation, so they are uncut from their original release date.",1096675200,296,2724,4.588477366255144
2053988,5,B00020SK1Y,"I was very annoyed that Warners released Volume One of this series without listing the contents either on the packaging or in any of their pre-release materials.  I see that they have followed that pattern here, but thankfully other fans are saying that this set will FINALLY have the greatest (IMHO) Bugs Bunny short ever.  (Hopefully this will have the normally unseen ""intro"" by Bugs which ""explains"" the operatic experiment (I've only seen this once in my life, in college in a film class discussion on German Expressionism!)  I didn't by Volume One specifically because of this omission, but I will definitely be buying Yolume Two.",1096156800,11,636,4.981132075471698
2053989,5,B00020SK1Y,"While I love Volume 1 and absolutely CAN'T WAIT for vol 2 (Book Revue! Back Alley Op-roar! Baby Bottleneck! Gorilla My Dreams!), I do have some requests for volume 3.  Hopefully someone hears me....

1) A Lad In His Lamp (sock 'im Smokey!)

2) Hot Cross Bunny

3) Hillbilly Hare

4) Robot Rabbit

These are great Bugs cartoons which I hope will surface in future volumes please oh please

2053992,5,B00020SK1Y,The cartoon selection on this set is a huge improvement over the 1st set.  My only complaint is there are too many Road Runner cartoons & not enough Black & White cartoons.  My Suggestion for wave 3 is Coal Black & De Sebben Dwarfs.  This cartoon was a tribute to the Black movie stars of the 40's.  The Black stars of the time even did the voices of the characters.,1094342400,3,366,4.185714285714286

8019855,5,B00020SK1Y,"Great collection of history and cartoons here, from some of the best guys to ever create cartoon magic. This finally completed my collection of the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection series, finally have all 1 -6 . I would say I'm a cartoon fanatic and Warner Bros. delivered by creating one of the best DVD cartoon series ever. Disc 1 is all Bugs with some of my favorites like ""Bugs Bunny Rides Again"", ""French Rarebit"", ""Gorilla My Dreams"", and ""Slick Hare"". Bugs Bunny in my opinion is way better than Mickey Mouse any day of the week. Disc 2 is mainly Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons, 12 in total, the good early Wile. E and RR stuff. Disc 2 also has two fantastic Hubie and Bertie (mice) cartoons and the ""A Bear for Punishment"" cartoon witch is definitely in my top 10. ""But It's Father's Day Henry !!!"" Disc 3 is mainly Tweety and Sylvester cartoons with some other oldies. Disc 4 more early 40's and 50's stuff including ""One Froggy Evening"" all-time great, ""Show Biz Bugs"", and ""What's Opera Doc"". You also get lots of great bonus material on each disc, which is what I really like about these Looney Tunes: Golden Collections is all the cool old Bonus reels, Documentaries, and other great Warner Bros. cartoon material. Overall this Volume of the Golden Collection is a 10 / 10. As a cartoon lover I'd say this is a must buy.",1520812800,,1342,4.526748971193416
