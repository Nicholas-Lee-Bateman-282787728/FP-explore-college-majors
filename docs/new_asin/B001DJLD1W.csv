3533483,4,B001DJLD1W,"As most of you probably know, the Nightmare on Elm Street series has its highs and its lows.  Out of these 4, the first and third are highlights with 2 and 4 being.. a little lackluster.  None the less, whether you're a casual fan or a major fanatic, you'll have a blast screaming or making fun of Freddy and his horrific antics with this easy-to-store value pack.  It comes with 2 double sided discs that shows the movie in full screen or wide, with a bare minimum of bonus features.  I thought the first four would be enough that I'd never want to watch another movie with an Elm reference, but actually I enjoyed them enough that I rushed to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-5-8-4-Film-Favorites/dp/B001DJLD0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street 5-8: 4 Film Favorites</a>, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way.

Like I said, this is a great value pack.  I love me some Nightmare, but not enough to store 8 DVDs.  With this I get all the fun without the guilt of having to find a place to put it.  If you are a major fan, however, and would like an attractive box set to show off your fanhood,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-Collection/dp/0780626966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection</a>&nbsp;looks like a great box set of the entire series (doesn't include Freddy VS Jason, though).

Pleasant dreams!",1248739200,7,1497,5.647321428571429
3533484,4,B001DJLD1W,This is a great collection.  People have already stated the pros and cons but I need to state one additional problem.  The first two movies had terrible sound quality.  I was constantly adjusting the volume because the scenes went from barely audible to deafening.  Maybe some other people can post reviews and say whether they had this problem too.,1245024000,,349,4.864406779661017
3533485,5,B001DJLD1W,"If you want awesome packaging, detailed liner notes, or any of the bells and whistles you won't find it here.  If you want the first four, and some of the best Nightmare movies made for a very low price, than look no further.  A great little collection for any horror fan.",1241568000,7,272,4.313725490196078
3533486,4,B001DJLD1W,"A Nightmare on Elm Street- This is the original that introduced Freddy to the world! Wes Craven made Freddy very scary, unlike the sequels! Nancy and her friends are having terrible and very realistic nightmares. When one of her friends dies, Nancy tries to figure out what is going on and who is doing it! Freddy Krueger looks awesome and scary, and Robert Englund is great at being Freddy! If you love Freddy, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET!!!

A Nightmare on Elm Street 2- It has been five years since Nancy killed Freddy. Now, a new kid lives where Nancy lived. Jesse and his girlfriend, Lisa find Nancy's diary that talks about who Freddy is and how she killed him. Soon, Freddy is back and he needs Jesse's body to kill people again. Can Lisa stop Freddy and save Jesse? I thought Freddy at the pool party was pretty cool, and Freddy showing his brain to Jesse. If you love Freddy, you might like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE!!!

A Nightmare on Elm Street 3- Freddy's 3rd is better than the 2nd, because he is in it more, and Nancy is back! Nancy helps teens with their nightmares at Westin Hills. Kristen has the power to bring people into her dreams. She gets help from Nancy, Joey, Kincaid, and others. Dr. Neil Gordon tries to help by burrying Freddy in holy ground and splashing his bones with holy water. This one hints about how Freddy came to be. (You find out more about that in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child') This is also kind of sad because Nancy dies toward the end. If you love the Freddy series, hopefully, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS!!!

A Nightmare on Elm Street 4- I thought Freddy's 4th was pretty good. Sometime after part 3, Kristen, Joey, and Kincaid realize Freddy is coming back! After Joey and Kincaid die, Kristen tells Alice about Freddy. Kristen dies and Alice is given a power because she is the dream master and could kill Freddy! There are some cool scenes like when Freddy is on the beach. One disgusting part is when Debbie is working out, and Freddy turns her arms into giant cockroach arms. Another cool/disgusting part is when Freddy is about to eat a meatball off a pizza, and the heads on the meatballs look like Alice's friends that keep dying. If you love the Freddy movies, you'll love A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER!!!",1232236800,3,2349,4.496487119437939
3533487,4,B001DJLD1W,"This is more of a review for the packaging than the movies, 'cause if you're here, you should know the drill on the movies.  This set includes the classic first one and the so-bad-it's-good follow-up, as well as ""Dream Warriors,"" which reinvigorated the series, and its lesser companion, ""Dream Master.""  As Sean L. already stated, the first movie is the standard 1-disc edition, not the Infinifilm edition (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-Infinifilm-Edition/dp/B000GETUDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street (Infinifilm Edition)</a>).

Combining these four movies as part of Warner Bros's ""4 Film Favorites"" series is a novel idea (and the second half of the series is available as a second ""4 Film Favorites"" set here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-5-8-4-Film-Favorites/dp/B001DJLD0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Nightmare on Elm Street 5-8: 4 Film Favorites</a>).  All four movies feature the exact same transfer, menus, and features as the individual releases, but in a 2-disc standard-size plastic DVD case, meaning that this set takes up 75% less room than the individual releases.

However, what you save in space, you lose in packaging.  As with all of Warner's ""4 Film Favorites,"" there is no internal artwork, such as a chapter insert, and even the two discs themselves feature no artwork, as they're flipper discs, with 1 movie on each side of each disc.  Because of this, the discs themselves look plain and are more prone to fingerprints and scratching.

So, do you care about space or about having the complete artwork for each movie?  Personally, I'm a big fan of this ""4 Film Favorites"" series:  I get to have all 7 Nightmare movies (and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") in 2 regular-size DVD cases, and the movies themselves have the exact same quality and content as the individual single-disc releases.  However, if you can't stand flipper discs, or if you're a collector and care about each movie (and want the 2-disc editions of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason (New Line Platinum Series)</a>), then bypass this one.",1226102400,61,2349,6.196923076923077
3533488,4,B001DJLD1W,"PROS:
For the price, you get a whole lot of Freddy.
Doesn't take up a lot of shelf space.

CONS:
The original film is the bare-bones release, not the Infinifilm edition.
The second movie is still pretty terrible.",1224547200,15,212,4.578947368421052
3533489,5,B001DJLD1W,I think the whole nightmare on elm street series is really good including Freddy verses Jason. Even though i don't really like Jason films in my opinion i don't really think that jason is any better then freddy krueger in his acting and his film i could never get into his own acting i think he is kind of dull at acting,1223683200,,320,4.17741935483871

Seen these movies multiples times but they are just Halloween classics that must be owned for any fan of classic horror.  The only criticism I would have is that that they are flip disc dvds in this set.  Which of course is such a pain because they can scratch super easily if you are not careful.  The Elm street film set 5-8 is not like that, they must have realized the error of their ways with the second set.  Happy almost Halloween!",1509062400,,520,4.26530612244898
3533511,3,B001DJLD1W,"I remember watching the Nighmare On Elm Street movies when I was a kid and loving them, however, I am an adult now and watched the 4 Nightmare movies and realized how bad my judgement of horror movies was when I was a kid. The first Nightmare on Elm Street was pretty good, but the others were TERRIBLE! I could barely stay awake watching the other 3 Nightmare movies. I am a HUGE horror movie fan (70's and 80's genre horror) but this collection should have not been added to my collection. The first Nightmare movie is a must to own, but the other three will defintely be collecting some dust in my house.

3533528,4,B001DJLD1W,"Other people have griped about this, but I have to echo their sentiment here: While I love the fact that the complete Nightmare series is in two neat packages, I am not a fan of the concept of ""4 Film Favorites"" overall because all one gets is four little squares of artwork on the front cover (at least the version I have) and no movie synopsis on the back (even though the movies are over, or nearing, 30 years old at this point in time).  With this package, one has to squint to see the titles on each side of the disc, either that or use a magnifying glass since the print is tiny.

The second package, with the last four entries into the Nightmare On Elm Street series (including Freddy's Dead and Freddy vs. Jason), has the four squares of artwork, but I like the fact that there are four separate discs with the original artwork on each one.  I would have loved to have seen that with this package.

The quality of each disc in this package is superb (even if I would love to skip Part 2, Freddy's Revenge, during a Nightmare marathon) and there are lots of extras to look at, if that's what you're into: Cast biographies (from the original press kits at the time of each movie's release), optional commentaries, and original movie trailers.

If you don't like to have separate cases taking up space on your shelves, then this would be a smart investment for you.  If you're looking for artwork and synopsis, hunt down the individual movies.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1480032000,,1468,4.434944237918216

3533561,5,B001DJLD1W,"the first four were always the best in the franchise to me and i could watch them all day everyday. brand new at a low price, i couldn't past it up. the first four really connected back to back giving in depth detail of the elm street legacy. the first touches on how freddy was a child murderer freed on a technicality and all the parents band together to torch him, setting him on fire burning him alive. then, he returns in nightmares killing their children. part two pays homage to nancy, the soul survivor of part one, leaving behind a diary in the house she stayed in on elm street which is soon discovered by freddy's next victim, jesse (whom he basically uses as a pawn to kill victims throughout the film) and jesse's love interest, lisa. it gives detailed information from part one of how scared nancy was and what happened during her struggle. 3 brings nancy back as an older psychiatrist who befriends a bunch of young teens dealing with freddy on a nightly basis the same way she did and she helps them put pieces together to counteract freddy's assault and onslaught of terror throughout the film. although 1 is the best in the franchise hands down, part 4 is my personal favorite-the dream master. kristen returns from part 4 as a gifted dream master who can pull people in her dreams much like she did in part 3. only this time, her gift is passed onto her best friend, alice, whom freddy uses as a prop to pull in her friends for terror torture. this is a must have for any nightmare/freddy fun and does not miss or disappoint in anyway.",1465603200,3,1554,4.437062937062937

I would recommend one of the boxsets. either way, its not a terrible set but there is better.

3533659,5,B001DJLD1W,"This is a collection of the famous film series from 1-4. In part 1, we are introduced to Freddy Krueger, a human male that was murdered by the townspeople for being a psychotic killer. He makes a deal with demons to be able to enter humans' dreams and kill them in their sleep. Some of the kids of Elm St. barely survive part 1. Part 2 is when Freddy wants to enter this realm from the astral world. One boy must fight the possession of Freddy in a supernatural and psychological battle! Freddy is beaten once again, but certainly not killed. Part 3 is the coolest of all the Elm St. films. WE FIGHT BACK HARD. Some kids discover that they can control and shape their dreams like in the other film Dreamscape(not an Elm St. movie). They use their dream powers to fight Freddy in the dream/astral realm. One heck of a fight but Freddy has more experience and still racks up a body count! One kid is different though and beats Freddy. In part 4,  Freddy discovers that he has a young male relative that would make a perfect replacement for him if he ever dies. Too bad for Freddy because the girl who beat him in part 3 is guarding the boy! This is the astral war of the ages between a gifted psychic girl and one of the most scary film monsters ever! Action, horror, and even some macabre comedy on Freddy's part(one liners galore) make this some of the best horror you will ever see.",1408406400,3,1383,4.319230769230769

3533728,5,B001DJLD1W,"The original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a good horror movie and is darkly comedic. The premise of the movie is that four teenagers are killed of one by one in there dreams. In my opinion it is the best of the series. The second movie ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Freddy's Revenge"" is also good but lacks the suspense and creepy atmosphere that the original had. It is about a teenage who moves into the house of in the original movie. Slowly he turns into Freddy and his girlfriends helps him overcome it. The third move titled ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" revolves around the last survivors of the elm street kids. It takes place in an asylum where the kids are being held. Heather Langthencamp reprises her role as Nancy from the original. She helps the kids defeat Freddy, in the end they bury Freddy and he his soul is put to rest. this movie is one the best in the series, second to the original. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Dream Master"" revolves around the surviving dream warriors. As they are killed off they are replaced by the new leading role, Alice. As the characters die, she gets their powers, and in the end she uses those powers to defeat him. This movie isn't one of the best but it does have its fair share of cool Freddy lines. Over all these first four movies are good because they balance horror with dark comedy. In my opinion, the Nightmare on Elm Street series is probably one greatest in the horror genre.",1358035200,,1431,4.40377358490566

3533730,5,B001DJLD1W,"These ""Four Film Favorites"" pack are a great value for fans of Freddy Krueger. This is a simple, cost-effective way of watching and owning the first four films in the Nightmare On Elm Street series.

As for the films themselves, well, obviously Nightmare On Elm Street Part 1 is the greatest of any Nightmare film. Part 2, Freddy's Revenge, actually gets a lot of flack and is sometimes called the weakest in the series. I disagree. I think it is actually one of the better ones as it carries nearly the same tone as the first. The third film, Dream Warriors, sets a precedent as it starts the ""dream"" movies as I like to call them. It loses the boyfriend/girlfriend dynamic of the first 2 movies and brings in a group of disturbed children to try to cope with and defeat Freddy. The fourth and last film in this collection, Dream Master, continues after the events of number 3 and again, a group of new kids has to defeat the menace that is infecting their dreams with such nightmares.

A second ""Four Film Favorites"" is also available which include Freddy 5-8 : Dream Child (1989), Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003). Buy if you are a Freddy fan!",1355702400,2,1211,4.576036866359447

3533734,4,B001DJLD1W,"I bought these used, and as such there is always the chance that the DVD might not be the best possible quality. There were scratches on a few of the disks which made viewing a bit difficult.  The movies themselves have withstood the test of time to become one of the best series he horror genre has to offer. I feel that after the third film the series (dream warriors) went from the horror genre to the comedy (dark comedy) genre. That actually may be one of the great things about the elm street series is it's inability to be pigeon holed into a single genre.
  The first two films are  horror movies (though the second is has extensive homoerotic subtext that I didn't notice when I was a child). In the beginning of the elm street series we have a movie that is pure terror. Freddy Krueger is not the most important character in this film because he remains a dark shadowy figure that haunts the dreamworld. In the original nightmare on elm street we have Nancy Thompson (played by the beautiful Heather Langenkamp), a strong willed young girl who slowly becomes aware of the danger of her dreams and fearlessly chooses to face it head on. The second movie gives us a teenaged boy named Jesse to root for, and though Freddy has much more dialogue in this film he remains veiled in just enough shadow to keep him menacing.
  The third film changes genres a bit mixing more fantastical elements in while keeping much of the theme from the first two films. This film may not be written as well as the original (or even the second film) but it does feature the return of the previously mentioned Nancy. Nancy has grown up a bit, now a twenty-something psychiatrist she is able to help a new group of teens fight against freddy.
  Part four has cast the horror genre aside. This is now a dark comedy and Freddy no longer sticks to the shadows. Freddy has hilarious one-liners that make the 4th film worth watching.  While a few of the characters from Dream warriors were in the dream master, I think that role of Kristen Parker suffered a bit from the transition. While the other survivors are played by the same actors, Kristen who was previously portrayed by Patricia Arquette is now played by Tuesday Knight. While Tuesday Knight might be a fairly decent little actress in her own right, it seemed that the writers forgot the very essence  of the Kristen character so much so that it seemed as though it was more than a recast. This didn't feel like two different actresses playing the same character. It felt like two actresses playing their own separate roles. This would have been fine if Knight had been playing someone new, but as it was I found myself wondering what could have possibly made this girl become so... I don't know.",1348444800,,2738,4.535496957403651

 The best part of this set is simply the price: your getting four feature-length films here for the price of one so this is simply a must-have especially if your a fan of the horror genre!

To me the first one is always the best one of a series; but I also liked Freddy's Revenge and the second best of the 4 is Dream Warriors. I was a little disappointed in 4; but it was still average movie. I thought after 4 the Freddy series would end and should of. I didn't like any of the rest in the series, because I thought they were lame; and eventually would hurt the series. I would recommend A Nightmare on Elm Street 1-4 to any horror fan; especially for any 1 who loved the first Nightmare. It is worth the money, time and U will not be disappointed.

3533750,4,B001DJLD1W,"This budget DVD set brings back nostalgic memories of the 1980's. Horror movie master Wes Craven made A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984), a surreal, dream-like, blood and guts horror film. I remember seeing these movies on local TV during Halloween. Robert Englund is flawless as child murderer Freddy Krueger. He's very, very scary and very, very funny. A Nightmare on Elm Street was spoofed on The Simpsons with Groundskeeper Willie trying to kill Bart, Lisa, and Maggie in their dreams! On Halloween, kids at school dressed up in Freddy Krueger costumes with plastic blades attached to the fingers of a glove.
James Rolfe, the Angry Video Game Nerd, spoofed the film as he showed us footage from the Nintendo game version of A Nightmare on Elm Street. A Nightmare on Elm Street was remade and rebooted in 2010.

A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984): A bunch of vigilante parents burn child murderer Freddy Krueger alive when the authorities refuse to punish him. Years later, Freddy Krueger preys on teenagers in their dreams. If they die in their dreams, they die in the real world. In these films, it's hard to tell the difference between the real world and a dream world. A young Johnny Depp and cute, sensual Heather Langenkamp star in this first film. John Saxon(Enter the Dragon, Mitchell) plays a police officer.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge(1985): This sequel was made without Wes Craven's input and it shows. Robert Englund is quite good as Freddy Krueger even though he only has 13 minutes of screen time. This is considered the worst Nightmare on Elm Street movie, but I think it's decent. Freddy Krueger uses the body of an angst-ridden teenage boy to kill people. People claim this film is packed with homoerotic imagery. Kim Meyers is quite good as the film's heroine.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors(1987): This is the best Elm Street sequel. Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon make guest appearances. We're introduced to new characters such as Kristen Parker(the lovely Patricia Arquette) and Kincaid(Ken Sagoes). There's some side-splitting gags. Freddy Krueger yells, ""WHO CARES WHAT YOU THINK?!"" at Zsa Zsa Gabor. Freddy yells the famous one liner, ""Welcome to Prime Time, @#$%^"".""  Chuck Russell directed the third Elm Street film and he went on to direct The Blob(1988) and The Mask(1994).

A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master(1988): Renny Harlin(Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) directs this one. Kristen Parker is back, but now she's played by Tuesday Knight! I laughed when Kincaid's dog urinated fire! Kincaid looks like a Super Mario Brother when he travels through a giant pipe!

The Nightmare on Elm Street films and the Friday the 13th flicks were slasher/horror movies that dominated the 1980's. They still deserve their R-ratings from the MPAA. You can enjoy the first four movies in the series thanks to this budget DVD. Friday the 13th was rebooted in 2009 and A Nightmare on Elm Street was remade in 2010. This DVD is worth the money if you love horror movies.",1316995200,,3017,4.929133858267717
3533751,3,B001DJLD1W,"This no-frills set gives you the original ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" movies 1-4 from the 1980's at a very affordable price. The DVD transfers of all the films are fine; offered in both Fullscreen and Widescreen formats. Each individual film will be discussed below. But viewing these films together, it is obvious there is more going on in the ""Nightmare"" series than Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) killing off Elm Street teens in their dreams;  and ""for real.""  The series depicts middle-class families in decline. Several of the ""Elm Street"" teens have parents who are alcoholic, sexually irresponsible, or otherwise emotionally or physically unavailable. The teens must battle Freddy on their own, until they learn to band together and pull each other into their shared nightmares; in an interesting story concept that is a precursor to the multi-level shared dream conceit of ""Inception.""

1. ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" (1984): If the original ""Nightmare"" has lost its initial shock value, it is still the best, and most frightening, film of the four collected here. Freddy Kruegar was a sadistic child molester/murderer. The Elm Street parents dished out some vigilante justice and burned him alive. Now their children have literal hell to pay for it. Freddy, with his razor-sharp fingers, is depicted as a truly menacing and horrifying boogeyman. Resouseful Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) figures out the only way to stop Freddy's dream killing spree is to bring him out into the real world and defeat him. Johnny Depp, in his film debut,  portrays Glenn, Nancy's boyfriend and one of Freddy's first victims.

2. ""Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985): This one goes seriously off-track. Freddy is inexplicably popping into the real world of his own free will, comitting random acts of violence and posessing the mind and body of Jesse (Mark Patton). The homosexual subtext is so obvious, it isn't even a subtext. The film takes the position that the real evil Jesse needs to be saved from is not Freddy, but his own barely repressed homosexuality. Significantly, only males are killed off in this movie, and Jesse's  annoying ""girlfriend"" (Kim Myers, acting like a junior Meryl Streep hungry for an Oscar) is anxious and available to ""save"" him. This film should be avoided, as it gives wrong ideas about horror and sexual orientation.

3. ""Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" (1987): brings us back to more familiar territory, with a story and screenplay co-written by original ""Nightmare"" director/creator Wes Craven. Heather Langenkamp returns as Nancy, who now works as a counselor at a mental hospital for troubled Elm Street teens. The teens have all ""attempted suicide"" --which really means they are being stalked by Freddy, of course. Nancy teaches them how to pull each other into their shared dreams as a means of combining their strengths and defeating Freddy. Some of the special effects are cheesy, but the story is interesting, and the nightmare hell depicted here is, once again, truly frightening. This film also features a funny scene involving Dick Cavitt, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Freddy.

4. ""Nightmare On Elm Street 4: Dream Master"" (1988): Robert Englund finally receives top billing here. Unfortunately, the series becomes derivitive of itself by now. Worse, Freddy (who appears ""in drag"" as a school nurse in one dream sequence) is depicted as funny instead of frightening. The film does successfully continue the ""shared dream"" themes of ""Dream Warriors"", and Lisa Wilcox as Alice is a worthy successor to Heather Langenkamp as the central ""Nightmare"" heroine. As Freddy kills her brother and all of her best friends, the initially mousy Alice becomes empowered as she absorbs their individual strengths. The film earns points for two innovative sequences: One is Alice's dream in a movie theatre. In the other, Alice is trapped in a ""dream loop"" and unable to save her friends. Despite its flaws, ""Dream Master"" does provide a satisfactory end to the series. That is to say, the series SHOULD have ended here. Alas, it did not. If you must have more Freddy Kruegar, see the interesting ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare."" ""New Nightmare"" actually exists outside of the series. Freddy has now achieved his own identity and is menacing creator Wes Craven and  original  ""Nightmare "" actors Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, and John Saxon in the real world-- forcing Langenkamp to portray Nancy one last time in another ""Nightmare"" movie. Got that? ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" also provides some worthwhile fun if you want to watch two horror movie icons/killers battle it out for supremacy in the same movie.",1311379200,2,4635,5.119047619047619
3533752,5,B001DJLD1W,"These four film favorites pack are an excellent value for fans who want to own all the movies and buy them at a reasonable price. $10.99 for four movies is a very good deal, especially when you consider that a single individual Nightmare On Elm Street film is almost the same price as this four-in-one DVD. Put it this way, this is a cost-effective way of watching and owning the first four films in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, however you lose packaging (you could also buy the Nightmare On Elm Street collection, a complete series box set with individual discs if you're a more serious collector). Unless you really wish to own each film separately, this may be the best way to own all the Freddy movies. This four pack has two flipper discs DVDs with A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) and Freddy's Revenge (1985) both on disc one, and Dream Warriors (1987) and Dream Master (1988) are together on disc two. To me the best Freddy remains the original but Dream Warriors is an excellent sequel and I like Dream Master as well. I'm not a huge fan of Freddy's Revenge and consider it one of the worst Nightmares but with this four film favorites DVD collection, I still own them all for a reasonable price.

A second ""Four Film Favorites"" is also available which include Freddy 5-8 : Dream Child (1989), Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003). However, these are the lesser Freddy movies, the ones that are a bit more cheesy, too funny and over the top. Fans usually don't like all the sequels and 5-8 are the ones that aren't remembered too fondly. I say for the value this is an excellent deal, four Nightmares film for this low price is convenient for a movie fan and collector like me. If you don't care about packaging and the flipper discs and just wish to save money, go ahead by all means. It's pretty obvious that some of the Nightmare films are better than others but we're not rating them individually, therefore collectively and with the cheap price this collection is deserving of a five for including what I consider the best Nightmare On Elm Street films. 5/5.",1306022400,9,2140,4.587467362924282

3533754,5,B001DJLD1W,"The Elm Street series ended with part 4 as far as I'm concerned. The original is a classic that still holds up (way better than the remake, I might add).

Part 4 continues in the same tradition as 3 and has many emotional and creative moments. Then... well... what the heck happened? Part 5 was a huge step down. And Part 6? Since when was Springwood in Ohio? Right off the bat you know you're in trouble when the filmmakers can't even get the location right. And it was downhill from there.

So the series was good for four films. That's why this 2 disk set works very well. I get all the good movies in the series on 2 disks (in one case). Saves me money...

3533756,4,B001DJLD1W,"If you're a fan of the Nightmare series and you're looking to own the movies on-the-cheap these 4-packs are really the way to go (the remaining Nightmare sequels are available on another 4-pack). The transfers are crisp and the sound quality is well-done for an on-the-cheap collection. There isn't a truckload of special features, but you're really not missing much unless you are a hardcore fan of the series. As for the movies themselves, whether you like this collection or the other collection really depends on which version of Freddy you enjoy - scary Freddy or wisecracking Freddy. For fans of the former, this is your collection. For fans of the latter, get the other collection. As for the films released in this collection, we start off with the original:

A Nightmare on Elm Street - Usually considered the best of the series, the original film treats the material with a seriousness usually lacking in subsequent visits and the film benefits greatly from that treatment. The film is filled with imagery and symbolism almost to the point where you feel like Wes Craven is trying to make more of an art film rather than a things-that-go-bump-in-the-night slasher film. To some that's a plus and to others that's a detrement, but there is something about the original that captures the imagination (of course, tapping into the universal fear of going to sleep and never waking up certainly helps.) Does the film hold up as well now as it did when it was released? Not necessarily. Craven has always had the ability to direct really terrifying sequences, but then surround them with the silliest dialogue/padding you're likely to see. However, in his defense, the silly parts exist solely to get you to like and/or care about the teenage leads (something the sequels did with less and less frequency.) The death of Tina still manages to shock and amaze and it truly is one of the more frightening sequences on film, but outside of the amazing nightmare/death sequences, Craven serves up a lot of mumbo jumbo about the power of dreams and the strength of fear. Unfortunately, as high-concept as his basic plotline is, it sort of falls apart near the end as the audience is expected to accept a rather ridiculous conclusion, which essentially contradicts the ending. If you're a subscriber to the theory that the whole film is one big long nightmare, then the ending is acceptable, but still a cop out. Be that as it may, the film still gets high marks for its exploration of the concept, its surreal imagery and its brutal death sequences.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge - Okay, here's where the Nightmare fans get divided. Although the majority takes the stance that this film sucks, it's really not as bad as you're led to believe. It's the last film in the series to treat Freddy seriously (that is, until Craven returns for New Nightmare) and it still tries for scares instead of chuckles. The basic plot of the film doesn't really hold water (Freddy's abilities and limitations seem to change from film to film, which usually results in one film contradicting another), but it essentially revolves around Freddy's attempt to possess a young teenager in order to carry out his brutal killings in the real world without the aid of dreams. Once again, there's some fantastic nightmare sequences (particularly the opening sequence with the bus) and a well-done transformation sequence which is surely the film's centerpiece, but the real star here is the entrance of make-up maestro Kevin Yeagher, who redesigns the Freddy make-up and makes Freddy look the most terrifying he will ever look throughout any of the films. Another bonus is Christopher Young's score to the film, which is probably the best of the series (sorry, Charles Bernstein - with the exception of your main theme, Young did it better.) Much has been made in later years about the film's supposed homoerotic subtext, but it depends on who you listen to (the writer insists it was intentional from the get-go, Robert Englund and Jack Sholder claim they were unaware of it at the time.) Despite its flaws, the film really isn't as bad as people claim and it's a hell of a lot better than some of the later sequels. Bottom line: it's still worth a look and, as the underdog of the series, it deserves a little more respect than it normally gets.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors - This is the one that introduces wisecracking Freddy, love it or hate it. Most fans cite this sequel as the 2nd best film in the series, but it does devolve into Velveeta land every now and again. Craven came back for this sequel, but only in a story capacity. Langenkamp returns as Nancy from the first film and we see a few familiar actors recruited for this adventure (Patricia Arquette, Larry Fishburne, John Saxon). The plot revolves around the last of the Elm St. children and their attempted suicides and problems involving dreams of the same psychotic monster (guess who?). Here they all are in a mental institution wherein they bond over their mutual restless nights. One survivor holds the ability to pull people into her dreams and, as such, may hold the key to destroy Freddy once and for all. In what was becoming a hallmark of the series, the effects and nightmare sequences are once again top-notch and the storyline finally sheds a little more background on our charred-face monster (once again, made up by Yeagher. Why do I keep mentioning him? Because it's important when you get to the other films and Freddy goes from looking organic to rubber-faced when other make-up artists tackle his visage.) Fans seem to respond to this entry because it moves at a quick pace and, for the first time, it seems like the kids might actually have a chance to stop Freddy once and for all with their various dream powers (though some are pretty laughable and completely dated. In example, ""In my dreams, I'm beautiful... and bad!"" If you know the scene, then you probably just laughed reading that.) This film even has a stop-motion fight sequence that would make Ray Harryhausen proud, though the script does suffer from some lapses in logic. There also seems to be the need for each of these films to continually have the most clueless adults on the planet, with each sequel presenting worse and worse totally oblivious adults - remember Nancy's dad from the original who didn't believe her? How about Jesse's dad from the last film who thought his son just needed some discipline? Now we have a female doctor who thinks these kids' nightmares are a result of the guilt they feel over sex, drugs and rock n' roll...) Despite these momentary lapses, it is fun to note the talent that exists behind the scenes - notice Frank Darabont (the writer/director of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Majestic and The Mist) who co-wrote the script or what about director Chuck Russell (who would go on to helm The Blob, Jim Carrey's The Mask and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Eraser)? It seems as though the Nightmare series has always been able to attract some top-tier future talent in its earlier days and the results show in this entry. Is it worth a look? Most definitely - if you want to know where wisecracking Freddy started and you want to rock out to a ridiculous Dokken song.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master - Freddy's back, Yeagher's back, some of the cast from Nightmare 3 is back and we have some more talent behind the camera - this time in the form of Renny Harlin as director (Harlin directed Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, the much-maligned Cutthroat Island as well as others). This film essentially picks up where 3 left off with probably the most inconceivable method of resurrection ever seen (flaming dog urine?) The set-up doesn't make much sense other than to get Freddy back to killing mode and he makes quick work of the survivors from Nightmare 3. However, there's a new player in town and her name is Alice. She somehow has the ability to control her dreams and is also able to ""absorb"" the essences of her friends that Freddy has killed. Thus, when it comes down to the big battle, she has the strength and abilities of all her friends - making her a match for our resident dream-stalker. This installment boasts the usual imagination and ingenuity in the nightmare sequences (with the Roach Motel sequence itself being a particular standout of the series as a whole.) The pace of the film is fairly kinetic (a result of Harlin, to be sure. His other films are generally paced the same way) and it results in a quick, enjoyable film experience. There's some silly 80's style montages as well as some ridiculous overacting on the part of the kids in this entry, but it's worth noting that this is probably the last enjoyable entry until Craven returns for the 7th installment. There's also some mumbo jumbo about gatekeepers of dreams that would make Craven proud in this entry, but overall, it's a solid investment on your 1 hour and 30 minute viewing time.

Bottom line: All of these films are worthy entries into the series and highlight an incredible amount of creativity from the special effects and make-up houses used to execute all of these films' various effects. In fact, for as cheaply as these movies are made, none of these entries ever manage to look cheap. Sure, some effects may seem outdated in today's modern times, but keeping in mind, they were high-tech at the time of release, you can see there was a lot of time, effort and money put into them. Don't let that be the only reason you decide to watch these movies - there are some genuinely creepy parts and there are some fantastic ideas floating around in these stories. If anything, this set is worth it to see the birth of one of the twentieth century's most notorious horror icons. See where it all began and, if you're a fan, we'll see you for the next collection.
