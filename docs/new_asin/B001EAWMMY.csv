In the dark days for the Third Reich, 1944 and on, special attention was placed on the defense of the Reich by the film crews and they were very successful in what they were doing.  These films show the other side of the war, the one that the vast majority of Americans never see and have never seen.  Yes, it is a long time ago and it does not apply to anything that is going on in the US today.  But it shows real bravery and guts, though for a bad cause and a lost cause.  The narration is naturally, propaganda, but the pictures themselves do not lie.  Excellent history.",1357948800,,649,4.235772357723577
8297279,5,B001EAWMMY,"If you enjoy watching real history without all the modern comments attempting to explain what happened 66 years ago, this is the way to see to it.  These are German newsreel shows that each and every German had to watch in the theater once a week during the war.  Yes, they are completely from the German and the Third Reich propaganda point of view, and that can make them even more interesting for those of us that enjoy real history and to see their perspective of events.  Very poignant to watch the faces of these people during those short but terrible years of turmoil.  True and real history at its best.",1285977600,4,611,4.4774774774774775
