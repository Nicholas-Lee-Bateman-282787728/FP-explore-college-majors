2807383,5,B000P28SV6,"I was first kind of skeptical when I heard of Inuyasha until I actually purchased the series and I have to say that I am completely hooked to Inuyasha. It's funny and actually has a story that you can follow; the english translation of the series stood out (oh how I dig Naraku and Sesshomaru voice) and the music is one of the top best. If you are looking for action with humor, then you have found the right anime",1362009600,,415,4.2
2807384,5,B000P28SV6,"I absolutely love Inuyasha. It was one of the first Animes I ever saw, and it is still good years later. The quality of the show on DVD does not disapoint. I am eagerly looking forward to getting the final act, so I can finally see how it ends.",1361232000,,244,4.0
2807385,4,B000P28SV6,"Kagome is a stressed teenage schoolgirl from the present day. Inuyasha is a surly half-demon from five hundred years in the past.

Yeah, it doesn't sound likely. But this odd couple becomes the unlikely protagonists of ""Inuyasha,"" an action-packed fantasy with plenty of romance and comedy on the sidelines. It has about as many dud episodes as any long-running anime series, but the overarcing battle against the malign Naraku in feudal Japan -- and the colorful array of supernatural creatures -- helps keep things interesting.

On Kagome's fifteenth birthday, she's suddenly pulled into a well on her family's shrine grounds -- and emerges five hundred years in the past. Even weirder, she's chased by a centipede monster, and the legendary Shikon jewel pops out of a side wound.

So Kagome is forced to free the trapped half-demon Inuyasha to save herself. He loathes her immediately because she's the reincarnation of Kikyo, the ex-girlfriend who trapped him in the first place. And when Kagome accidentally shatters the Jewel, she and the grudging Inuyasha have to team up to recover its shards, which Inuyasha wants to use to eradicate his human half. To make matters even more complicated, a witch brings his ex-lover back to unnatural half-life -- using Kagome's soul.

And then a charming, lecherous monk, Miroku, reveals the truth -- Kikyo and Inuyasha were turned against one another by an evil demon, Naraku. What's more, Naraku is collecting fragments of the Shikon jewel, so Inuyasha can get his revenge and his jewel shards at the same time. With Miroku, the beautiful and haunted demon-slayer Sango, and outspoken fox Shippo, Inuyasha and Kagome set out to stop Naraku.

The feisty little band encounters a lot of problems as they collect shards of the Jewel -- vast white dragons, the manipulative Kikyo, a malevolent dark priestess, demon bats, wolf barbarians, Inuyasha's own darker side, and an endless stream of demons coming from Naraku's vanishing palace. And they face their worst challenge yet when a band of bloodthirsty warriors are revived by Naraku, and a horrible transformation begins...

The entire plot of ""Inuyasha"" is a pretty complex one -- the ""Band of Seven"" arc alone is more complex and action-packed than many anime series are in their entirety. And though there are many standalone demon-of-the-week stories, the overarcing story is about Our Heroes trying to hunt down and kill Naraku -- and dealing with the many other people with their own motives and goals.

And we get plenty of blood and battles, weird attacks (a cyborg tank-man!) and big flashy anime attacks involving supersized swords and special weapons (Sango's giant boomerang). And the fantasy element is kept alive via an endless stream of demons, ranging from the pointy-eared, handsome types to a vast dragon with an extra face. Rumiko Takahashi's rendition of Japan's past is a pretty colorful one.

But it's not all action -- there's loads of comedy, mostly provided by the shrimpy Shippo (""They call me the Fox Demon of Justice!""), but also from Miroku's constant butt-fondling, Inuyasha's ""sit"" necklace, and Kagome's ongoing problems with her schoolwork. One entire episode is devoted to a flea romance gone horribly wrong, and another to the shrill toady Jaken trying to steal Inuyasha's sword.

Like any series, it has some duds, most of which are TV-only episodes not based on Takahashi's work. One particularly silly one involves Kagome and Kikyo being trapped in a priestess-eating cave demon... kind of like that space monster that almost ate the Millennium Falcon. Fortunately episodes like these are outweighed by better work, such as the spellbindingly complex ""Band of Seven"" arc.

One thing to keep in mind: this series does not have a proper end. It finishes on a big ""To Be Continued"" note -- but fortunately they made a sequel series that finishes everything up nicely.

Kagome and Inuyasha play off each other well from the start, whether they're bickering (""But you said you wanted to protect me!"" ""I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT!"") or awkwardly being romantic. They're kept from being yet another not-quite-together anime couple, by virtue of the fact that Inuyasha's clay-zombie ex is still lumbering around and making plays for his guilt-ridden affection.

An equally cute if less complicated couple rounds out the main cast, namely the naughtily lovable Miroku and the angst-ridden, capable Sango, as well as the cheeky fox-demon Shippo. And there's a complex cast of supporting characters -- Inuyasha's beautiful lethal older brother Sesshomaru, the little human girl who unexpectedly touches his heart, the rough yet kindly wolf demon Koga, and the cowardly flea Myoga.

The complete ""Inuyasha"" series is an action-packed fantasy ride, with just enough romance and comedy to keep it steady and entertaining. Watch this, then the sequel series.",1360454400,7,4876,5.141414141414141

These episodes might not be in blu-ray like the others I bought, but their quality is still amazing. The picture is so pretty and every second of it makes me more happy I bought these.

Every night after that I tried my best to stay up until 2 or 3am to see the show.

2807489,3,B000P28SV6,So does this set come in the collectible boxart like in the picture or is it the crappy DVD case with five DVDs per case.,1405900800,,121,3.88

2807493,1,B000P28SV6,"Considering the individual season run anywhere between $16-$25 a piece I don't see how anyone could consider $400 a good price for all 7 seasons. Even at $25 a piece that is only $175 for all 7 seasons.

2807496,5,B000P28SV6,"Excellent anime. I was hesitant to buy because I have made the mistake of buying bootleg versions of animes and being extremely disappointed but other buyers need not be concerned here; these are the actual Viz media products, NOT bootlegged versions. Slightly deceptive description though since you will need one last mini season called ""The Final Act"" to actually finish the series after you are done with seasons 1-7. Viz markets the last season differently so 7 seasons technically is the complete set. Still confused the heck out of me when I watched the last of season 7 and they didn't wrap up the story. That's when I learned about ""The Final Act"" and the four movies.",1371686400,53,676,4.786324786324786
2807497,4,B000P28SV6,"Yes, the product is great and I love Inuyasha! The only problem is that all of the seasons were boxed sets...except for season 1. Now, from seeing the prices of season 1 on Amazon, I couldn't understand why I did not receive the box set for season 1.

Just a small irritation, other than that the product is great!
Just be careful of the mis-advertisement.",1369958400,,356,4.476923076923077

2807499,4,B000P28SV6,"My wife is a huge fan of this show, and sometime before Christmas, she had lamented never having seen the end of the series; so having found this, I ordered for her as a gift. She quickly went about watching the entire series, but we were both disappointed to find that the series does not feature the ending. As it turns out, in addition to the series, there are four Inuyasha movies. It's not that the seller is being dishonest, the package does include the full series, just not the movies, which is something purchasers should be aware of (especially those of us who don't know the first thing about anime).",1365465600,2,611,4.513513513513513

8188376,5,B000P28SV6,"Inuyasha was my first anime show back in the '80s as I was growing up. The main characters are awesome and the main villain was unstoppable. It is my most favorite anime, with Ghost in the Shell as second favorite. It launched me into the anime world and it took me years to collect DVD versions. I was pleased that the creators released the final chapters, but saddened that a great anime show ended. As Captain Picard said: ""All great things must come to an end."" And Inuyasha, in my opinion, is a GREAT show. Thank you for having it in your inventory so I could complete my years-long mission to add this anime series to my collection and feel young again by watching this incredible anime until the end-of-days.

Sincerely, Tim Guilford",1516838400,,740,4.56390977443609
