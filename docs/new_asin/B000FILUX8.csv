8123203,4,B000FILUX8,"I was 7 years old in 1941 and just starting to go to movies.  Gene Autry was my favorite cowboy. This movie is a standard Autry offering and that's pretty good.  Gene saves the day in this movie but who cares?  We expected him to do so.  Gene Autry was everybody's hero.  If you are an Autry fan, you need this movie.  This series of 'fully restored' DVDs are top notch video and excellent audio.",1369180800,,396,4.213333333333333
8123204,5,B000FILUX8,"Love the B westerns,and Gene Autry was one of the best.  His collection of remastered DVD's is fabulous.  I have about 35 of them including the volumes collections.  They are some what pricey but well worth it. Wish more of the other old classic B westerns would remaster their series.

For anyone who wants to relive those days of Saturday matinees and watch your heroes on the silver screen this is one way to do it.",1317081600,,418,4.4605263157894735
8123205,5,B000FILUX8,"Hi, This is the first time I have written a review !  I am a Gene Autry fan of many years & enjoy all his movies .  My only complaint with some of them is, that there are not enough songs. , however , with this one, the songs & the singing are extra good. also in this film ,Smiley Burnette has more input than usual, so there are some laughs on the way especially when he imports wild animals into the story.  As usual the photograpy is excellent so some good scenery to view.  In my opinion this is a film that compares well with "" South Of The Border "" which is a favourite .  If you love Gene Autry & are looking for sheer entertainment , then, this movie is a winner.  Enjoy. Fran",1223510400,7,685,3.9635036496350367

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette (aka: Lester Alvin Burnette)
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.
