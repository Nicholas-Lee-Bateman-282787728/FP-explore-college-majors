8324276,4,B00009RDGT,"O.K., Once again nobody wrote any review for an XPW DVD; XPW: Best of XPW Television, so then I will. As with Damage Inc. and Exit Sandman, nobody wrote a review so then I did. I wrote a review for Retribution in order to be more sociable. This DVD has nine matches including the two bonus matches, available on only DVD version. The first match is in a cage with garbage one kendo stick apiece. Johnny Webb vs. Messiah. It was a good match. The next match is a good match; Sabu vs. John Kronus. The next match is between Supreme vs. Axl Rotten. The next match is Abdulla the Butcher vs. Axl Rotten. Good match. The fifth match is a good match between Johnny Webb vs. Homeless Jimmy. The sixth match is a good death match between Supreme and Messiah. The rest of the Black Army attacks Supreme after the match, and he is rode by ambulance to the hospital. The seventh match is Mexico's Most Wanted and Rey Mysterio Sr. vs. West Sidazz and Carlos Montana. The last two matches are bonus matches. X-Pac vs. Juventude and Youthanasia vs. Angel and Sharkboy. Both good matches.",1126483200,3,1073,4.451776649746193
