4401268,4,B004LGGXG4,"At first I was not interested in buying or seeing this movie.
Especially since the last couple of movies in the series were not good!

However, when I saw Bill Zane was in it(he was in the 1st one), I decided to take a chance and buy the movie.

Im Glad I Did!!!!

Sure, it is a straight to DVD film, but it has many qualities of a theater release... it is also one of the better B movies I have seen in a while!

The action is intense! The acting was good & waaaaaayyyyy better than your typical Steven Segal releases... The plot/story is excellent...

I think they got it right with the addition of Zane... It brings back just the right amount of feeling from the first Sniper movie...
Becker son ROCKS in this movie... He is very calm & shows what a soldier is capable of with out being over the top & trying to match his Dad in the former movies.

This movie was never boring & I think would appeal to many age groups!
I will be watching it many more times & hope they do a sequel!

Thanks for reading my review!",1303776000,2,1016,4.101010101010101
4401269,3,B004LGGXG4,"This really was a poor movie.  The story was weak, the acting poor, and the realism, well it was very unrealistic.  Case in point, getting shot in the shoulder with a high-powered rifle and then packing around a 20lb or 30lb backpack the very next day with no medical attention, painkillers, etc.  Stuff like that.

So why 3 stars? Well, because Billy Zane was just so enjoyable in this.  Very deadpan, very relaxed and acting like he was just having fun being in a direct-to-dvd movie.  ""Listen to your friend Billy Zane, he's a cool dude!""",1303776000,3,541,4.583333333333333
4401270,3,B004LGGXG4,"Brandon Beckett, on a deadly mission to stop a mysterious sniper targeting innocent civilians. Co-starring rising star Chad Michael Collins as Brandon Beckett, along with action stalwart Richard Sammel (Casino Royale, Inglourious Basterds), SNIPER: RELOADED offers next generation thrills and a kill-or-be-killed intensity Sniper fans won't want to miss.

While working with the UN Forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Marine Sgt. Brandon Beckett (Chad Michael Collins), son of renowned sniper Thomas Beckett, receives orders to rescue a European farmer trapped in the middle of hostile rebel territory. When he and his men arrive at the farm, a mysterious sniper ambushes them, wounding Beckett and killing everyone else. With the help of his father's former protg, sniper instructor Richard Miller (Billy Zane), Beckett must learn to think like a sniper to track down the assassin before the sniper returns to finish the job.

What I Can Tell You: I have never seen Sniper from 1993 starring Tom Berenger but my husband had. He originally thought this was that movie until we sat down to watch and he wondered were Billy Zane was. Billy doesn't show up until almost 40 minutes in.

Ok, so here is what I know. Berenger played a Marine sniper Thomas Beckett. In this movie Chad Michael Collins plays Brandon Beckett, the son of Thomas Beckett who is following in his fathers foot steps although there was some obvious ""daddy anger issues"" and he is not yet a sniper. (added note: Check out Chad Michael's blog for an interesting diary of the making of this movie.)

Brandon's troop was ambushed while on a peacekeeping mission by a sniper and he is left as the only survivor. While they prepare for their next mission of finding the sniper assassin. Billy Zane's Character, Richard Miller, who was trained by Thomas Beckett back in the day, returns to aid Brandon on learning how to be a sniper. Brandon is not interested until Richard suddenly appears in Congo much to Brandon's chagrin.

I am not at all familiar with Chad Michael Collins but his face looked very familiar. Maybe that is because he looks like Berenger. I would have liked to see more gunfire and a sex scene that lasted over 3 minutes however for a straight to DVD movie, this wasn't half bad. The best parts of the movie featured Billy Zane who was great in his matter of fact, straight up delivery! If there is another, please bring back Billy!",1303344000,15,2427,4.86682808716707

The filming was pretty and the action was, you know, active, but I kept getting lost on the way from point A to point B.

Once it was finally over, of course, the plot was evident.

4401318,5,B004LGGXG4,"EXCELLENT movie! I gotta tell you all, I was extremely skeptical about this ""3rd sequel"" to the original ""Sniper"" film with Tom Berenger (the ""senior"" Becket). I've ordered ""Sniper 2"" & ""Sniper 3"" (not having seen them yet), so when ""Sniper: Reloaded"" came in first, I figured ""What the heck - let's watch this thing & get it over with...!"" Boy was I surprised! The action was 1st rate, the ""attention to details"" when producing sniper performances was about as close to the real thing as I've ever seen, and all the actors (& actress) performed their roles quite well. The only real ""downside"", if you will, was the usual ""gratuitous sex"" scene thrown into the middle of the film, a scene in which the movie would've actually been better off had it been left out entirely - that said, it was a relatively minor scene & the rest of the movie more than made up for this little bit of ""cinema indiscretion""... As such, I'm going to actually rate it ""5-stars"". Billy Zane has a continuous ""running back-up role"" (Richard Miller, Tom Berenger's ""partner"" in the first ""Sniper"" movie). He doesn't look much like he did in the first movie - in fact he looks different enough with his beard & what not that I had a hard time realizing it was, in fact, Billy Zane from the 1st film. But he did an excellent job. In many ways, this movie was just as good as the original was - and that's saying a LOT for a ""sequel #3""...!! Well worth the cost!",1406246400,,1435,4.4393939393939394

The marines depicted in this don't behave like marines basically. This could have been a good movie if the enemy sniper was really a enemy. That's exciting but the typical movie storyline about corrupt people on your own side sucks.  Billy Zane is great in this but he's only in a few scenes. And the newcomer cast is decent.

4401333,3,B004LGGXG4,"All things considered for a low-budget action flick - not bad. The loss of Tom Berenger from the series is evident; his presence sorely missed.

Still, newcomer Chad Michael Collins was decent as the son of Gunny Beckett. Again, not producing a performance of note - but not completely dropping the ball either. But 'eh' isn't exactly a quality one looks for when they're screening for leading men. Hopefully he works on his craft. I like the cut of his jib - perhaps he has a shot at something better. Maybe.

Opens as Marine buck sergeant Brandon Beckett is deployed with his unit as part of a UN peacekeeping mission to the African Congo. Assigned the role of protectors, they're ordered to cull all remaining civilians out of a rebel infested area. Despite repeated attempts, there's one hold out. The mixed platoon of marines and local government forces is given the mission of getting that stubborn man into the safe zone. Tragically, only two out of the dozen men of that mission will escape with their lives. Ambushed upon their arrival, they're killed by a single sniper of superior skill. The only survivor from the marine element, and just barely, Sgt. Beckett.

He's rescued by a local hunting guide who discovered the massacre. Despite what honor tells the sergeant, to help the hunter who saved his life, his responsibility lies with his orders and seeing to safety the daughter of the murdered victim.

Once his charge is safely delivered out of the combat zone, he files his after-action report expecting something to be done. Not just for payback, but to prevent further deaths against peacekeeper forces. But to his shock and dismay, the blood-soaked intelligence is essentially round-filed and he's dismissed. Stunned, he realizes that the bureaucracy will move too slowly, if at all. And despite the dangers to his person and career, goes against direct orders. He's going AWOL, determined to hunt down the shooter who murdered his fellow marines and nearly sent him to the pearly gates. But not before a mysterious friend steps in to advise and counsel the brash young warrior.

Was never a fan of Billy Zane. There's something about his efforts that, for some reason, has always rang false for me. Which is odd, since, I think he's a decent actor.

So I'm very pleased to say that I thought he did exceedingly well in his return to the franchise. Better than I could've or would've hoped for given my previous statement. The years seems to have given him a tempered humility and grounded humanity that I always felt he lacked. Having avoided him for the past decade or so, I'm now going to reinvestigate the man and his works. I'm intrigued with the remote possibility that he might have actually found a way to extract a performance without being completely asinine and phoney.

Overall, a decent flick made watchable by Zane's surprisingly excellent performance. A decent addition to the series. And for fans of snipers/sniping - an okay addition to the genre.

Movie Note:

- Would willingly pay extra for any military-inspired film to have at least one veteran as an advisor. The small details are the ones that sometimes irritate the most. The very last scene, which should have been a 'yahoo' moment, turned sour as a Navy Commander introduces himself as an Army Major. C'mon!

There has got to be thousands of vets who would *volunteer* to assist filmmakers for no pay. Three hots and a cot for a week or two - and these flagrant mistakes can be so easily addressed.

One can only hope.",1347062400,,3515,4.793388429752066

4401336,3,B004LGGXG4,"First off I was confused as to if this belongs in the Sniper series which starred Tom Berenger. I know Billy Zane was in one of the Sniper films as well but since I hadn't caught that one, I wasn't sure if this is a standalone are part of that series.

This film wasn't as bad as I assumed it would be. I try to stay away from anything that has Billy Zane in it seeing how he's been in B-movie hell for the last fifteen years. I decided to check this out after seeing the trailer on On Demand. I was surprised at how good it was (for a B-movie) and found it entertaining.

I don't care for military movies much but Chad Collins had me intrigued. He's not only very good-looking but has true star quality that keeps you watching. He's a good actor and portrays Brandon very realistically. It's a shame this wasn't a major picture so more people could see his work.

Unfortunately the plot is something I've seen a million times. A soldier Brandon(Chad Collins)is sent on a mission and his men are all killed by a mysterious sniper. Brandon is determined to found out who was behind the ambush and of course it leads to someone connected to him. I won't add more for fear of spoiling but the plot and the ending could've been more imaginable. You'll be able to guess who the culprit is in twenty minutes.

The actors are all good and even Zane is a pleasure to watch in this probably because he didn't show up until halfway through the movie. There's an unnecessary romance between Brandon and Ellen his superior which makes no sense because there was no development towards it. At the beginning of the film Brandon tries to pick up Ellen after a bet (not knowing she's a Lieutenant) and she shoots him down. Then they meet up again about an hour into the film, go on one date and make love. It seemed obvious that this so-called romance was just thrown in so the move could have a sex scene. Why I don't know because it was completely pointless.

The movie is fast-paced which is always a good thing. It's no Platoon but it stands on its own as a decent military flick. The plot was the weakest part but the film is exciting enough to make you wanna keep watching until the end.",1336176000,,2177,4.325980392156863

This movie is pretty graphic, but does have a few details which have been over look and as you can see that things like the Navy does not have Majors, the Class A's for the USMC do not have name tags, and Lee Enfield sporter or sniper rifles are not 5 shot, but rather 10 round shooters. All in all you won't be disappointed if you are a fan of this movie series it keeps up with the tradition minues the previously mentioned details. Tom Beringer is not in this one, but Billy Zane comes back from the first movie and provides an good insight and humorous punch lines.  This is worth having in your movie collection.  I rated it a 4 start due to the details of the military, but if it wasn't for that I would be a 5 star.  Also the language translation is very good as I have seen the movie in Spanish along with the subtitles.",1311033600,,950,4.141304347826087
4401341,1,B004LGGXG4,"What a terrible movie! Nothing like the first, this isn't a sniper movie this is practically urban combat in Africa. The jr Beckett doesn't do any sniping with the exception of 2 or 3 shots. Aside from the terrible portrayal of U.S. Marines...(the recent movies about Iraq do a hell of a better job of depicting us than this one does!), this movie could have done alot better. What a typical 21st century movie- can't ever go without with sex scene...could have definitely left that out. About the only good part was one of the guy's heads getting blown off. Glad I didn't buy this movie and watched it online instead. Watch the Battle for Haditha - that's a hell of a movie.",1308268800,7,675,4.495934959349594
4401342,2,B004LGGXG4,"good movie. but low budget. should have been better. good plot. but tried to imitate tears of the sun but fell way short. love scene was unnessary. wait for movie to come out on FX or Spike Tv..imagine someone trying to imitate the soul singer James Brown on a youtube type program, and you will get what this movie reminds me of..... overall a good opportunity for a first time actor who may be trying to build their resume for future work. but thats' all...",1307577600,,459,4.411764705882353
4401343,5,B004LGGXG4,"Wow that was way better than I thought it would be! To be honest, I was forced to watch this movie with my boyfriend who's in the military. He was blown away by the gritty realism and the authenticity. Marine's,like, freak out if they don't feel they are represented correctly. As for me, I liked the story and the scenery (there were some beautiful shots of the African landscape. )COuld've done without the RAUNCHY SEX SCENE THOUGH GEEEZ!! It wasn't all guns and one-liners. Plus the lead is fuggin GORGEOUS and did a good job acting. Are his lips real though? hmmmm...",1306627200,9,571,4.607843137254902
4401344,4,B004LGGXG4,"That was the line spoken by Billy Zane prior to blowing off the head of a UN Congo soldier with a 50 caliber (?) bullet. I must say the special effects on the blood and bullets were good. The plot is another story. It made me go to Google. First off there is no United Nations code of Military Justice, nor is there a United Nation Military Code of Criminal Justice. In fact it is just the opposite. There is no military code of conduct in the UN which has caused problems in recent times and the UN is in the early stages of looking into such a code. The movie attempts to make a statement about strong patriotic military men vs. weak politicians who play both sides of the coin.

Chad Michael Collins plays ""son of sniper""  (I don't recall seeing the other movies) in this weak plot, no character developing saga of UN gone awry in the Congo. Billy Zane had the best lines in the whole movie, unfortunately he wasn't in the movie enough to make it work. One sex scene, no nudity, don't recall any f-bombs. Collins as an actor was about a C- if Zane is an ""A"". If you have a choice between this and a Steven Seagal or Steve Austin movie, choose this one. 3 stars plus a half star for the guy's head getting blown off.",1305849600,5,1218,4.200854700854701
4401345,3,B004LGGXG4,"Sniper Reload was a good movie, but I think it should have had more action and less drama to it.",1305849600,,96,3.85
4401346,1,B004LGGXG4,"I love the first sniper movie it was great. This sniper reloaded wasn't. There are a bunch of stupid scenes and the story line is awful. Example: a scene where the star character Sgt. Beckett shoots the radiator of a jeep that causes it to loose control and wreak,what? Also the beginning of the movie where Sgt Beckett urges his team to stay out of the line of sniper fire but half the movie he's running straight out into the open. Billy Zane has no significant roll. This movie was more like a TV movie on the USA network. Weak, please stop making sniper sequels they suck. Don't bother with this one.",1304640000,3,604,4.401785714285714
4401347,5,B004LGGXG4,"A fifth remake in the series and a direct to video besides.  This is a typical men at war in the jungle movie with very little star power.  Forget about the junk that preceded it.  This movie has great production values.  The story is very good.  The actors and script are great.  And the african animal scenes and views of Africa need to be seen in Blu-ray to be fully appreciated.  There are so many movies like this, but so few that rise above the mundane to truly entertain.  See this movie.  You may even want to own it.",1304294400,13,525,4.222222222222222
4401348,3,B004LGGXG4,"Can you ever compare to a legend?  After being ambushed on a mission Sgt. Beckett (Collins), must step into his fathers shoes.  Can he become as good of a sniper as his dad was and fight his way home?  I spent the last few days watching ""Sniper 1-3"" in order to catch up.  Although it helps to know the back story of his father and why Miller (Zane) is helping, but it's not necessary.  This movie is very much like the other three, action is very good and exciting to watch.  When there is no action or shooting, which is about 80% of the movie it slows way down and is hard to stay focused on it.  If you like the other ones you will probebly like this one.  I did not.  If you like ""The American"" you will probebly enjoy this also.  I just couldn't stay interested.  I give it a C.

Would I watch again? - I will not.",1303862400,2,820,4.024844720496894
4401349,4,B004LGGXG4,"Couldn't wait for the release of this movie!

It wasn't as good as the first one; however, it definitely was worth viewing/buying.

Billy is superb (as usual) and they let his charm come shining through.  I wish, however, that his part was bigger but IF (please) there is a sequel, I think that his part will/should be bigger!

I do miss Beringer, however.  And it would be a good idea for the next movie to have Berenger, Chad and Billy as a three part training mission.  I didn't watch all of 2 and 3?, so assume that Tom Beckett is not dead.

Definitely a movie worth viewing (especially if you like action flicks).  It was a little too bloody for me in parts, though, but that is the nature of ""sniper"".

Thanks for bringing Billy back!",1303862400,3,740,4.382352941176471
