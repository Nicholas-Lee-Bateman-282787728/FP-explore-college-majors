3175325,5,B0017SVH5Q,"""Death Note"" was a much better flick than I was expecting. It was a huge hit in Japan, and because I had never read the original manga, I had avoided it thinking I wouldn't get the entire story. My loss, as it turns out.

The cat-and-mouse detective game mixed with the fantasy elements of the gods of death and their magical books makes for an interesting story. The two main characters, ""L"" and Light, are an intense duo, and like the best of this genre of film it is hard to decide who to root for. Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara, ""Battle Royale""), known by the general public as the hero/murderer ""Killer"", is the holder of the Death Note, and has the power to kill anyone on Earth just by writing their name. A hardcore and brilliant student of criminal justice, he uses his power to erase the vermin of the world, serial killers, child rapists and gangsters. For the most part, his actions are praised, but he is still a murderer in the eyes of the law, and needs to be brought down. On his side is the Ryuuk, a Japanese god of death who gave Light the Death Note in order to keep himself entertained. Hunting him down in ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama, ""Linda,Linda, Linda""), a young, oddball genius with a penchant for sweets who keeps his name hidden in order to protect himself from the powers of the Death Note. L hunts Light, and Light hunts L, and it is never clear who is the person a step ahead, and who is the fly falling into the web.

Director Shusuke Kaneko, who cut his teeth on Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman flicks, managed to keep the story close enough to the manga to please the fans while making it complete enough that newcomers don't feel that they are only getting a part of the picture. The CG animated Ryuuk stands out at first, but soon becomes a natural part of the storyline, and Kaneko's familiarity with the special effects learned from the monster films did him good service. All of the actors do a great job, particularly Fujiwara and Matsuyama as L and Light, who carry the movie on the strength of their performances.

""Death Note"" was a great enough film that it had me running to pick up the sequel, which actually makes a single film ""Kill Bill""-style, as well as checking out the manga and the spin-off flick ""L:Change the World"". All of them are high quality, and all of them are recommended.",1212105600,18,2322,4.471698113207547
3175326,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I just watched this in the theater as part of its (very) limited May '08 US theatrical release, and it was simply magnificent!  There were a few slightly quirky or off-beat directorial choices, and somewhat rudimentary special effects; but overall, I found it exceptionally entertaining.

The premise is very clever, and the one-upsmanship of the plot twists are simply brilliant.  Of course, I think the real appeal of a story like this is that there are actually TWO protagonists in fierce conflict with one other - a rare and difficult literary feat.  On the side of the law, we have a neutral (perhaps even slightly evil) hero, known only as ""L.""  Opposite L, we have ""Kira,"" a chaotic anti-hero with a deeply twisted sense of justice.  It's that highly satisfying kind of narrative that invites you to root for either or both side at the same time, depending on the color of your soul.

The roller coaster ride that unfolds - both in the movie itself and the depths of your own conscience - is a thrill ride not to be missed.",1211241600,16,1030,4.626373626373627
3175327,4,B0017SVH5Q,"So the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/manga/dp/1421501686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">manga</a>&nbsp;was a massive worldwide sensation, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/anime-series/dp/B000T28G2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">anime series</a>&nbsp;is destined to go down as an all-time classic, and you people still can't get enough.  Well, here you go: ""Death Note"" has now been quite successfully adapted as a two-part series of live action films.  I put off watching them for some time out of fear that the story would be butchered, but -while neither are brilliant films- I'd have to say that I'm impressed by how closely the films were able to match the original storyline while adding some new flourishes that can only be seen as improvements.  As long as expectations aren't too high, I think most will be pleased by this version of the story that every Japanophile knows by heart by now.

The film opens with a single black notebook falling from the sky, landing on the nighttime pavement during a rainstorm.  Next, we see criminals performing violent acts and/or getting set free before their names are scrawled across the screen; seconds later, they drop dead.  The news reports speak of ""Kira"", an invisible force that is delivering judgement on criminals that are escaping punishment and running rampant.  Some people say Kira is a monster, some say he's a savior as the crime rate continues to fall.  It is then we meet Light Yagami; a college student with a genius intellect, a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and a notebook that kills anybody whose name is written within it's pages.  ""Death Note"" is the same as it ever was, a story about means versus ends, civil rights versus civil order, the line between good and evil, and the true meaning of justice.  This movie's best feature is it's respect for the original story.  This is what every film adaptation should strive to be.

In spite of all the goodness, there are major bumps on the road to adapting a first-rate anime to live action.  First off, this is obviously a serious live-action film; one that involves supernatural creatures known as ""shinigami"", the Gods of Death.  These creatures are essentially perfect CG reproductions of their respective manga/anime counterparts.  Ryuk (Light's shinigami who we meet in this film) is extremely distracting whenever he is onscreen as he appears to have just stepped out of a videogame into the real world.  He's my favorite character from the anime (along with Misa, who is introduced here and co-stars in the sequel), but in this film he's an annoyance at times.  There are some things that just don't translate well to live action and CG anime characters are one of them.  L, the mysterious and bizarrely eccentric detective sent to bring Kira to justice is a unique character and the true hero of the story adn the actor portraying him does a fine job, but his kooky mannerisms come off as rather cartoonish when you watch a real person ape them.  These are all minor issues that can and probably should be swept aside considering the difficulty of faithfully adapting an anime as popular as this one to film.  But people who are not already fans of ""Death Note"" will almost certainly be put off by these things so they have to be taken into account.  And if anybody can tell me how the Red Hot Chili Peppers factor into the vibe of these films, do share.  ""Dani California"" just seems like an odd choice for a theme song is all;  especially when there is so much great music on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-Tribute-Music-Soundtrack/dp/B000R3C5IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note Tribute Music Soundtrack</a>.

All-in-all fans should be more or less pleased with this film, whose exceptional faithfulness to the source material should be commended.  But there are a lot of peope who will likely be put off from this movie the second Ryuk flies in in all his 2nd-rate CG glory.  The end of tis one leads into the sequel which is actually better and offers a new and superior conclusion to the already brilliant story of the manga/anime.  So have no fear ""Death Note"" fans; this one gets more right than most feature film adaptations.  However, I can't really recommend it to the average filmgoer.  The bad CG really does a number on this film visually and it just doesn't hold up to the perfection of the anime series.  3 1/2 stars rounded up for degree of difficulty.",1211155200,12,4550,5.218707015130674

3175337,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Of the three live-action films in the Death Note series, the first is the most skillfully crafted. With its themes carefully wrapped up, just the right amount of down-time in-between the tension, and an excellent portrayal of a marginally more sympathetic Light Yagami, what weve got here is a unique film experience that shouldnt disappoint long-time Death Note fans or newcomers to the series.

The second is more meandering, rather like the section of the manga it is based on, that is, volumes 4-7. (Though it naturally includes moments from volume 3, my favorite, these parts are tragically cut short if not modified entirely for time constraints.) However, it is also very well done and follows the manga fairly well. With an extremely detailed and clever plot-twist, this 2.5 hour film manages to cover the flying leap from volume 7 into volumes 11-12.

The third film is a spinoff that is for the most part not directly adapted from the manga, which I naturally won't review here as it's not included in this set.

I love the Death Note manga and have seen parts of the anime, which I wasn't quite satisfied with. (I felt that it was of good quality, but a bit too melodramatic and presented a rather too impassive version of the antihero.) However, I was really impressed with these films. Any changes were inventive, aided the condensation of the rather long story, and were generally pleasing.

First, Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light: absolutely astounding in every way. Im not one of those people who likes Light Yagami either out of fascination or amusement or sympathy; I all but hate him, but an accurate portrayal is naturally critical for any telling of this story. Tatsuya Fujiwara presents a wholly human but utterly ruthless depiction of the storys antihero; one moment you're sympathetic, the next disgusted. Hes as completely natural in crazed smiles or laughter as in ordinary behavior. Not to mention his movement; as with any good manga, from the still pictures of Death Note you are able to somehow see how each character actually moves even more effectively than in an anime, as if they are actually real people. Fujiwara captures the essence of Lights lazily brilliant, calmly tense demeanor. Definitely a five-star performance.

Next, Kenichi Matsuyama as the mastermind known as L: excellent to begin with, his performance improves with every film. L is without a doubt the most difficult part to play in any production of Death Note. A funky genius with weird eating habits, weird expressions, weird movements- pretty much weird everything. It works great in the manga; L is most Death Note fans favorite character; every picture in the manga that contains L is worthy of either laughter or amazement when not both. However, for L to climb off of the pages of the manga as a real person who could interact with the real characters on the screen or with you is a nigh-impossible feat.  Matsuyama comes incredibly close with the first film and hits the nail on the head with the second.

Thirdly, execution: Very good. There are a few character modifications and plot twists; but mostly its acceptable as they're trying to cram 12 volumes worth of manga into 4.5 hours. (No Near or Mello, as youve probably already gleaned, but as you can see, there is no time for them.) Some of their choices were a bit regrettable, but its really amazing to see how theyve managed to condense the story so cleverly. One thing that bothered me was the very slight over-emphasis on the Kira killings. I felt that some of the time spent watching criminals die of heart attacks or viewing Kiras accomplices scenes would have been better spent on L vs Light verbal sparring. I really missed seeing a lot of that, as it was my favorite part of the series. However, there are some really awesome scenes for L and Kira to butt heads and I thoroughly enjoyed them, few as they were. Also, at times the films appear to marginally break the complex rules of the Death Note as they are presented in the manga; however, the rules themselves and the events of these films are intricate enough that they make it very difficult to find an absolute plot-hole.

Finally, the quality: these are really well-made movies. Nice filming, sets, and effects; Ryuk is perfect, as is Rem. The Shinigami interact with the actors very well. Sure, the CGI looks a LITTLE dated once in a while if you're actually searching for it; but mostly they look just like real, 3D versions of their manga counterparts. The music is well-placed and not overbearing.

My mother enjoyed these movies almost as much as myself, and she had never seen or read anything Death Note. I'd say it's a fairly safe place to start if you're looking into the story but comic books aren't really your thing.

As a last note, I want to add that if you can manage to purchase a copy of these movies that includes an English dub as I did, its worth it. The dub is of really high quality and the English-language voice-actors are very good. They are actually partially the same actors who dubbed the anime version of Death Note. (FYI: the English dub contains the F-word.)

The other half is another movie, Death Note: The Last Name. Together, as I have said, they give you a much more satisfying ending to the story of Death Note.

They do an amazing job at integrating Ryuk into the movies, and by that, I mean the fact that Ryuk is CGI does not distract from or lessen in any way the awesomeness of this movie. Quite the contrary in fact, he is realistically created and motion capture technology was used in all of his movements, making him one of the best parts of this being a live-action movie.

The movie overall is not bad, but as you would expect any lengthy piece of fiction being crammed into a two hour movie, they had to approach it from a different angle. The character portrayals are spot on, even Ryuk the shinigami, although the acting is a little over-the-top. They use the cliche of newspaper headlines multiple times throughout the movie to demonstrate the enormity and number of Kira's (the main character) crimes. The other thing that throws me is that they not only subtracted some storylines, but they added some new ones as well, which you don't usually expect in a film conversion. The movie starts with him in college, rather than high school, though he experiences much of the same events. However, he has a girlfriend with him for much of this movie that didn't exist at all in the anime. They also stretched out another character's role in the story (Naomi) and changed some names (pointless). They do keep the main arc of the story intact, and perhaps the new additions are just so fans would have something new they haven't already seen in the anime...I will admit it is kind of cool the way it works out. I think anybody that has done a little bit of research will realize that this movie does not really have its own ending, rather it is continued in the second film.

If you are not as fanatical about the anime as I am (it is the best), you can take or leave my review. The whole movie, I was commenting on how this was/wasn't like the anime...but if you just need some more Death Note in your life, I highly recommend it (though you really should watch the anime first and learn the story beginning to end with all its beautiful characters and nuances).",1311552000,,1935,4.447887323943662

I love Deathnote.  I own both the manga and the anime.

If you've never watched the anime or read the manga: Please don't let this be your first Deathnote experience.  And don't be afraid if you've never watched/liked anime before.  I was never too into anime, and the first and only manga I have, and I immensely enjoy both.  I know movies can never quite live up to books, but this sets a new low standard.  I'm not a book snob, and I generally enjoy movie versions of books.  In fact, this is the only one I would refuse to ever watch again.  This is just an incredibly watered down version of something great.  You'll be missing out on lots of details, and the characters just lack any depth.  The dubbing is terrible, so you're essentially forced to watch with subtitles.  The English versions of both the anime and manga are excellent.  If your reason for getting this is because it's cheaper, save up the money for another media, get it on Netflix, borrow it from someone, or at the very least, buy this used.

If you've seen the anime or read the manga: Do yourself a favor and don't watch it, or at least don't buy it.  Both my husband and I were severely disappointed by it.  The storyline is SIGNIFICANTLY altered, and not in the way of just leaving out one part of the plot--they take it any completely change it.  There's much more detail in both the anime and manga that a movie just can't cover.  Everything in this just seems muted--Light doesn't seem as evil, L is lame, Ryuk is somehow more cartoon-y than in the animated version.  Everyone lacks personality, and the tension and heavy, dark feel just does not transfer over.

For those of you who have only seen the live action version, check out the other versions.  It puts this to shame.",1307923200,7,1820,4.47112462006079

It doesn't follow the mangas perfectly, like most film adaptations, but it by no means completely butchers it.  Oh, and Ryuk may look awkward at first, but you'll get used to him.

3175376,5,B0017SVH5Q,"After hacking into the police database, a young law student is horrified to see that the legal system is failing, and its criminals are being released without charge. Angered, he sets out to confront the criminals himself, but instead, he finds a mysterious notebook lying in the street: the Death Note. Amongst other rules, the book claims that any person whose name is written within its pages will be struck dead in seconds. Light is amused with the idea, and writes down the name of a murderer he saw on the television before going to sleep. The next day, Light awakens to the news that the same man was discovered dead from a heart attack. Realizing that he has the power of the gods in his hands, Light sets out to cleanse the world of evil using the book, but his ego quickly consumes him, and he begins killing anyone that threatens to oppose him. Now, a resourceful computer hacker that goes by the name of ""L"" has teamed with the police in order to expose the wayward vigilante and bring him to justice.

Based on the popular Japanese manga of the same name, DEATH NOTE is a high-powered parable that demonstrates how absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is told through an exciting murder mystery where there is no clear hero or villain. Light Yagami is noble at heart, but by superseding the court system and acting as judge, jury, and executioner, he has become that which he hates. L, on the other hand, seems to have the same fundamental beliefs in justice, but his true motives and intentions are never revealed in this first act. The deep philosophical questions that are raised by the Death Note reflect on society's views of good and evil, justice and immorality.

Tatsuya Fujiwara, who is best known for his lead in BATTLE ROYALE, captures the duality of Light's character perfectly. He is sincere in his nobility, but his ego prevents him from giving up his new found powers since he has become consumed with winning the battle of wits against L. This causes him to compromise his own ethics by killing the innocent police detectives that have gotten too close to the truth. Kenichi Matsuyama plays opposite of Fujiwara as L, whose odd appearance and awkward mannerisms make him a strange but interesting choice as the supposed hero. Each of their intricately-laid traps and foiled attempts to draw one another out into the open drives the mystery and suspense as they enter into a deadly game of cat and mouse.

Shusuke Kaneko has done an excellent job adapting the popular series on to the big screen, allowing DEATH NOTE to take #1 in the box offices in Japan upon its release and making it one of the strongest Japanese exports in years.

3175394,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I totally was expecting a subpar adaptation of the excellent anime series (first manga) DEATH NOTE, which, for those unfamiliar with the storyline, involves the vigilante-justice use of a death god's notebook by a brilliant student, and his self-corruption while using it as he tries to evade justice in the hounding form of a sugar-addict Gothy detective genius.

The anime was loads of fun, with cool music and excellent visuals. The manga was fun. And, hoorah, the film is terrific. I was not disappointed (except for the fact that there is an especially spoiled boy quality in the face/manner of the actor who plays Light Yagami, the death note wielder, that I found particularly annoying in spots, and effective in others.)

The story is told across two DVDs (this is the first part of the total story, which deviates in places from the other tellings). This one shows how Light Yagami obtains the notebook from the death god (shinigami) Ryuk (or Ryuuk or Ryuku, as I've seen various spellings). Ryuk is a blast to look at in all the media, and works really well in the film while still retaining his weirdness (especially the face). REM is also effectively rendered, btw, in the second dvd/flick. The young actor who portrays L is delightful in his portrayal of the unusual mannerismss and broody but low-key playful demeanor of the brilliant (and somewhat ruthless) detective who hides his name from Light. Were I a teen, I'd have a massive-crazy crush on him and his ruminative, sweets-loving self. As a middle-aged woman, I allow myself a minor crush. :)

The action moves at a good pace and the increasingly tense challenges that L and Light offer to each other are fun to watch--even knowing where the story goes. The two young actors work well against each other.

Be sure to see the conclusion in the second flick. It's equally enjoyable and resolves beautifully (and differently from the anime). I ordered the third live-action film (not part of the original storyline) just to see L again, despite the less than wonderful reviews. You can probably skip the third, but do not miss this one and the follow-up, DEATH NOTE II: The Last Word. I do not think  you will be disappointed, be you a fan of the characters/story or a total newbie to Death Note.

After several viewings and becoming more familiar with it, I fell in love with Fujiwara Tatsuya's Light, and Matsuyama Ken'ichi's L. Ryuk was a wonderful CGI animation job, and the movie overall was a pleasant take on the Death Note manga/anime canon, not that I object especially to the changes, as I feel it kept rather faithful to the spirit of the series.
I could see why some people would rather have it dubbed than subtitled, but for my two cents, I find subtitles easier (I'm a fast reader), and it's less distracting if the voices aren't out of synch with the mouth movements, not to mention the tones of the actors voices, I think, is preferable if one wanted to get a feeling for the characters.

3175396,4,B0017SVH5Q,"being really only a neonate in anime, meaning i really only watch what comes on adultswim and what i hear on the grapevine, i was really unsure that deathnote could be made into a full length movie. this had kept me from seeing it when it played in a few theatres not too far from my home. all i have to say is that i was dead wrong.

having finished reading the manga about shortly before the series ended stateside, i knew the basic plot and i kind of knew what to expect. light yagami finds the deathnote by happenstance, realizes it actually works and begins his crusade against injustice in society as kira, the name he has taken from his followers.

if you've watched the series, read the manga the above information is a given. what had really concerned me before i watched the movie was the pacing. as stated in other reviews, the first movie takes place over the span of 12 episodes in the anime, which comes out to about a running time of a little over four hours as compared to the two hours of the movie. needless to say, i was afraid the plot or characters were going to be underdeveloped and it would all fall apart under the weight of what it was trying to accomplish.

this also introduced a second concern along the same line. having watched the series, read the mangas and finally realizing where the movie was going to end in the grand scheme of things, (don't you just hate it when you know the alotted time can dictate the plot for you?) i was concerned about the ending point. i would imagine when completing the movies as they have chose to do, they would want to make sure that each movie ends with that classical cliffhanger or a resolution of sorts. going back to my knowledge of both the anime and manga, i just couldn't find the logical ending dynamic enough.

on both accounts though, i was thoroughly surprised. in reference to the time constraints, characterization is done beautifully. the ony complaint i have is the lack of characterization for L, but then again, i realize that he will step into the spotlight while all the other investigators fade and take more secondary roles (or maybe lower than that). furthermore, anime always seems to have a useless dialogue and the movie has seemed to streamline everything a bit creating a much more even flow.

as for my concern for the ending, two characters are given much more life to create the correct type of ending, an ending that is far different from that of the anime or manga, an ending that makes a great springboard for the next movie. overall, the ending was astounded me and i had thought i knew what i was in store for.

as for the other odds and ends, i was rather surprised that those the acted in the dubbed version of the anime do so as well in the movie. subtitles can also be limited translation japanese text rather than speech which is a nice touch.

after watching the first movie, i'm really curious to see the second. however, at this pace, i'm curious how many movies they will make to complete the whole? i thought i was through with deathnote, but alas, it has captured me for a second go.",1233360000,,3098,4.45326278659612

3175398,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Based on the manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide, ""Death Note"" the live action film makes its way to the US on DVD.

""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and the theme song ""Dani California"" by the popular band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
.

The film focuses on Light Yagami (Fujiwara), an intelligent student who wants to work in criminal law and follow his father's footsteps and catch criminals. But one day after hacking into the police department's computer system, Fujiwara is just sickened to know that the police has released criminals who should be incarcerated. One night, Yagami discovers a notebook called ""Death Note"" that has specific rules:

-The human whose name is written in this note shall die.

-This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their
mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will
not be affected.

-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,
it will happen.

-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart
attack.

-After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

-This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the
ground of (arrives in) the human world.

-The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner,
i.e. a god of death.

-The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.

Anxious to test this book out, Light writes the name of a criminal, thinking that the book is a joke. That is until the person's name that was written actually dies. Thus Light finds a way to get justice and does what he can to rid the world of all evil and become ""the God of the new world"". He also meets the owner of the Death Note, a shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk, who is fascinated by Light of his ways of killing the criminals but the way his mind works.

Light who uses the name ""Kira"" starts writing the names of criminals in the Death Note and each die by heart attack and thus causing a frenzy in the media and the police force who now need to go after the person killing the criminals. But Kira is not your average criminal, as he is quickly generating a large fandom of people who support Kira's goal of eliminating criminals.

Of course, the police force led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, has no idea of how to go after this criminal but unbeknownst to them is a mysterious person that goes by the name of L. An intelligent detective who has an unorthodox way of catching criminals and so far, has been very succesful with his cases worldwide.

The cat and mouse chase has begun as L goes after Kira and Kira realizes his greatest enemy is L and thus the battle begins.

The film stars an all-star cast with ""Battle Royale"" actor Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light Yagami, Kenichi Matsuyama who starred in films ""Linda Linda Linda"" and ""NANA"" as the mysterious detective L.

Joining the two is one of Japan's most popular actress, Asaka Seto as Naomi Misora, a former FBI agent who's fiance is killed by Kira. Model and actress Yu Kashii as Light's girlfriend Shiori Akino. Shigeki Hosokawa as FBI Agent Raye who is hot on the trail of catching Kira, actress Erika Toda who plays the character of pop star Misa Amane and Takeshi Kaga, best known for the host of the original ""Iron Chef"", who plays the role as Light's father and head of police, Soichiro Yagami.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is featured in 169 anamorphic widescreen and was originally shot in 35mm (1:85:1 ratio). My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk. And how that would translate on film and was quite pleased with the 3D character as it looks exactly like it does in the anime and manga series.

As for audio, the film is featured in both English and Japanese via digital 5.1 and 2.0 stereo. I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series. So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include a director's interview and the trailer to the film. Plus there is a trailer for the anime series and ""Viz Pictures presents"". The features are quite short but it was great to see an interview with director Shusuke Kaneko addressing the challenge the staff had to adapt the manga series to a live action film and what changes that had to be made.

I would have liked to see all features together as one featurette and a ""play all"" command but that's a minor quirp but nevertheless, I'm just happy there are special features on the DVD.

I was extremely pleased with the live version of the film. I expected that there would be slight deviations from the original manga and anime series because there is only so much you can pack into a two hour movie.

But even with the slight changes, everything worked out. The pacing was well done, the CGI of Ryuk was well done. But those changes from the original series is what gives the film it's own life.

Unlike the manga and anime series, Naomi Misora (Seto) has a slightly different role, as does Shiori Akino (Kashii) that plays a major pivotal role early in the series of how demented Light has become, even with a followup comment by Ryuk. Fantastic!

But the plus for this film was the talent involved. Tatsuya Fujiwara is such an impressive actor that it was great to see him take on the role of Light Yagami. To see Fujiwara's acting show the believable and caring Light Yagami evolve into the killer known as Kira was just fantastic. Kenichi Matsuyama as L was also well done.

But of course, the addition of other talents such as Asaka Seto. She's such a popular TV drama and film star that it was great to see her as the vengeful Naomi Misora and it's great to see Mr. ""Iron Chef"" Takeshi Kaga as Soichiro Yagami.

I was extremely pleased with the first live action film and the treatment it has received on DVD. I enjoyed watching it in Japanese but watching it again with the voice actors of the original anime series. Again, I'm not fond with English dubbing for a lot of Asian films but VIZ was smart in utilizing the voice actors for the anime series on this live film. Well done!

I was actually expecting the Japanese version with subs (which I had seen previously via the internet over 10 times), but I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a dub with the anime dub's voices. The original movie was excellent, and while the dub feels a little more comedic (if your not used to seeing peoples words not match their mouth's movements, it's funny for a bit), it's still amazing. Fans of both the original and the anime will enjoy this, despite the awkward mouth-movements-cannot-fit-dubbed-over-voices-properly thing. It's still cool - if you love Death Note, you'll love this! :3 (Don't shun the dub just because it's a dub!)",1222041600,2,745,4.7384615384615385

3175404,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Death Note is based on the popular manga (Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I saw the anime series on imported dvd, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan in a while. I will review both films because one movie while phenomenal and definitely can stand on its own, the story is very much linked together.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:
In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.

In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami (Death God), brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.
As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.
That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts absolutely--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?

Man has no right to play GOD.
This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films. Some may say that the film also contains a social commentary.

The battle of wits between L and Light Yagami is definitely one to watch; as the two geniuses struggle to stay one step ahead of the other. It is rather curious that such a complex match-up of intelligence also proves that the two are actually two sides of the same coin but on opposing sides. L is pretty much a charming if eccentric presence as the sugar-loving detective. I didn't know that sugar does provide energy for the brain until I observed him gulp down significant amounts of candy and dessert. The thing that proves Light Yagami quite dangerous is the fact that he believes that he is doing the right thing and whatever steps he has taken may seem cruel, it is justified. When one believes his cause his just, one becomes more determined than the common opponent.

Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual with a very solid structure. The direction by Shusuke Kaneko effectively promotes intense energy and never lets up on the suspense, further accentuated by its twists and turns. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is pretty intense, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass other films in terms of plot) I will stop here, since with this film, the less you know, the better it would be.

Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

3175405,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I'm a huge fan of both the anime and the manga (It's my current obsession) so when I got the chance to go see the movie in theaters, I was ecstatic. I'll admit, the dubbing looked a bit...goofy, but that didn't change the fact that it was just as awesome as the Manga/Anime. Truth me told, I was recovering from eye surgery when I went to see it, so the fact that it was dubbed was a blessing, since it meant I didn't have to try and read subtitle. Another bonus was getting to hear L's wonderful dub voice while seeing the adorable L in the movie. XD

On a serious note, I hope hey release ""Last Name"" and ""LChange The World"" as well. I've only seen ""Death Note"", and really want to see the other two.

I recommend this DVD for any fan of Death Note, or anyone who enjoys a good psychological suspense movie. It realy makes you think! And if you don't want to watch the dub, there's this magical setting called 'subtitles' that lets you watch the Japanese voices, with English voices.

3409822,5,B0017SVH5Q,"""Death Note"" was a much better flick than I was expecting. It was a huge hit in Japan, and because I had never read the original manga, I had avoided it thinking I wouldn't get the entire story. My loss, as it turns out.

The cat-and-mouse detective game mixed with the fantasy elements of the gods of death and their magical books makes for an interesting story. The two main characters, ""L"" and Light, are an intense duo, and like the best of this genre of film it is hard to decide who to root for. Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara, ""Battle Royale""), known by the general public as the hero/murderer ""Killer"", is the holder of the Death Note, and has the power to kill anyone on Earth just by writing their name. A hardcore and brilliant student of criminal justice, he uses his power to erase the vermin of the world, serial killers, child rapists and gangsters. For the most part, his actions are praised, but he is still a murderer in the eyes of the law, and needs to be brought down. On his side is the Ryuuk, a Japanese god of death who gave Light the Death Note in order to keep himself entertained. Hunting him down in ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama, ""Linda,Linda, Linda""), a young, oddball genius with a penchant for sweets who keeps his name hidden in order to protect himself from the powers of the Death Note. L hunts Light, and Light hunts L, and it is never clear who is the person a step ahead, and who is the fly falling into the web.

Director Shusuke Kaneko, who cut his teeth on Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman flicks, managed to keep the story close enough to the manga to please the fans while making it complete enough that newcomers don't feel that they are only getting a part of the picture. The CG animated Ryuuk stands out at first, but soon becomes a natural part of the storyline, and Kaneko's familiarity with the special effects learned from the monster films did him good service. All of the actors do a great job, particularly Fujiwara and Matsuyama as L and Light, who carry the movie on the strength of their performances.

""Death Note"" was a great enough film that it had me running to pick up the sequel, which actually makes a single film ""Kill Bill""-style, as well as checking out the manga and the spin-off flick ""L:Change the World"". All of them are high quality, and all of them are recommended.",1212105600,18,2322,4.471698113207547
3409823,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I just watched this in the theater as part of its (very) limited May '08 US theatrical release, and it was simply magnificent!  There were a few slightly quirky or off-beat directorial choices, and somewhat rudimentary special effects; but overall, I found it exceptionally entertaining.

The premise is very clever, and the one-upsmanship of the plot twists are simply brilliant.  Of course, I think the real appeal of a story like this is that there are actually TWO protagonists in fierce conflict with one other - a rare and difficult literary feat.  On the side of the law, we have a neutral (perhaps even slightly evil) hero, known only as ""L.""  Opposite L, we have ""Kira,"" a chaotic anti-hero with a deeply twisted sense of justice.  It's that highly satisfying kind of narrative that invites you to root for either or both side at the same time, depending on the color of your soul.

The roller coaster ride that unfolds - both in the movie itself and the depths of your own conscience - is a thrill ride not to be missed.",1211241600,16,1030,4.626373626373627

Well, here you go: ""Death Note"" has now been quite successfully adapted as a two-part series of live action films.  I put off watching them for some time out of fear that the story would be butchered, but -while neither are brilliant films- I'd have to say that I'm impressed by how closely the films were able to match the original storyline while adding some new flourishes that can only be seen as improvements.  As long as expectations aren't too high, I think most will be pleased by this version of the story that every Japanophile knows by heart by now.

The film opens with a single black notebook falling from the sky, landing on the nighttime pavement during a rainstorm.  Next, we see criminals performing violent acts and/or getting set free before their names are scrawled across the screen; seconds later, they drop dead.  The news reports speak of ""Kira"", an invisible force that is delivering judgement on criminals that are escaping punishment and running rampant.  Some people say Kira is a monster, some say he's a savior as the crime rate continues to fall.  It is then we meet Light Yagami; a college student with a genius intellect, a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and a notebook that kills anybody whose name is written within it's pages.  ""Death Note"" is the same as it ever was, a story about means versus ends, civil rights versus civil order, the line between good and evil, and the true meaning of justice.  This movie's best feature is it's respect for the original story.  This is what every film adaptation should strive to be.

In spite of all the goodness, there are major bumps on the road to adapting a first-rate anime to live action.  First off, this is obviously a serious live-action film; one that involves supernatural creatures known as ""shinigami"", the Gods of Death.  These creatures are essentially perfect CG reproductions of their respective manga/anime counterparts.  Ryuk (Light's shinigami who we meet in this film) is extremely distracting whenever he is onscreen as he appears to have just stepped out of a videogame into the real world.  He's my favorite character from the anime (along with Misa, who is introduced here and co-stars in the sequel), but in this film he's an annoyance at times.  There are some things that just don't translate well to live action and CG anime characters are one of them.  L, the mysterious and bizarrely eccentric detective sent to bring Kira to justice is a unique character and the true hero of the story adn the actor portraying him does a fine job, but his kooky mannerisms come off as rather cartoonish when you watch a real person ape them.  These are all minor issues that can and probably should be swept aside considering the difficulty of faithfully adapting an anime as popular as this one to film.  But people who are not already fans of ""Death Note"" will almost certainly be put off by these things so they have to be taken into account.  And if anybody can tell me how the Red Hot Chili Peppers factor into the vibe of these films, do share.  ""Dani California"" just seems like an odd choice for a theme song is all;  especially when there is so much great music on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note-Tribute-Music-Soundtrack/dp/B000R3C5IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note Tribute Music Soundtrack</a>.

All-in-all fans should be more or less pleased with this film, whose exceptional faithfulness to the source material should be commended.  But there are a lot of peope who will likely be put off from this movie the second Ryuk flies in in all his 2nd-rate CG glory.  The end of tis one leads into the sequel which is actually better and offers a new and superior conclusion to the already brilliant story of the manga/anime.  So have no fear ""Death Note"" fans; this one gets more right than most feature film adaptations.  However, I can't really recommend it to the average filmgoer.  The bad CG really does a number on this film visually and it just doesn't hold up to the perfection of the anime series.  3 1/2 stars rounded up for degree of difficulty.",1211155200,12,4550,5.218707015130674

3409834,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Of the three live-action films in the Death Note series, the first is the most skillfully crafted. With its themes carefully wrapped up, just the right amount of down-time in-between the tension, and an excellent portrayal of a marginally more sympathetic Light Yagami, what weve got here is a unique film experience that shouldnt disappoint long-time Death Note fans or newcomers to the series.

The second is more meandering, rather like the section of the manga it is based on, that is, volumes 4-7. (Though it naturally includes moments from volume 3, my favorite, these parts are tragically cut short if not modified entirely for time constraints.) However, it is also very well done and follows the manga fairly well. With an extremely detailed and clever plot-twist, this 2.5 hour film manages to cover the flying leap from volume 7 into volumes 11-12.

The third film is a spinoff that is for the most part not directly adapted from the manga, which I naturally won't review here as it's not included in this set.

I love the Death Note manga and have seen parts of the anime, which I wasn't quite satisfied with. (I felt that it was of good quality, but a bit too melodramatic and presented a rather too impassive version of the antihero.) However, I was really impressed with these films. Any changes were inventive, aided the condensation of the rather long story, and were generally pleasing.

First, Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light: absolutely astounding in every way. Im not one of those people who likes Light Yagami either out of fascination or amusement or sympathy; I all but hate him, but an accurate portrayal is naturally critical for any telling of this story. Tatsuya Fujiwara presents a wholly human but utterly ruthless depiction of the storys antihero; one moment you're sympathetic, the next disgusted. Hes as completely natural in crazed smiles or laughter as in ordinary behavior. Not to mention his movement; as with any good manga, from the still pictures of Death Note you are able to somehow see how each character actually moves even more effectively than in an anime, as if they are actually real people. Fujiwara captures the essence of Lights lazily brilliant, calmly tense demeanor. Definitely a five-star performance.

Next, Kenichi Matsuyama as the mastermind known as L: excellent to begin with, his performance improves with every film. L is without a doubt the most difficult part to play in any production of Death Note. A funky genius with weird eating habits, weird expressions, weird movements- pretty much weird everything. It works great in the manga; L is most Death Note fans favorite character; every picture in the manga that contains L is worthy of either laughter or amazement when not both. However, for L to climb off of the pages of the manga as a real person who could interact with the real characters on the screen or with you is a nigh-impossible feat.  Matsuyama comes incredibly close with the first film and hits the nail on the head with the second.

Thirdly, execution: Very good. There are a few character modifications and plot twists; but mostly its acceptable as they're trying to cram 12 volumes worth of manga into 4.5 hours. (No Near or Mello, as youve probably already gleaned, but as you can see, there is no time for them.) Some of their choices were a bit regrettable, but its really amazing to see how theyve managed to condense the story so cleverly. One thing that bothered me was the very slight over-emphasis on the Kira killings. I felt that some of the time spent watching criminals die of heart attacks or viewing Kiras accomplices scenes would have been better spent on L vs Light verbal sparring. I really missed seeing a lot of that, as it was my favorite part of the series. However, there are some really awesome scenes for L and Kira to butt heads and I thoroughly enjoyed them, few as they were. Also, at times the films appear to marginally break the complex rules of the Death Note as they are presented in the manga; however, the rules themselves and the events of these films are intricate enough that they make it very difficult to find an absolute plot-hole.

Finally, the quality: these are really well-made movies. Nice filming, sets, and effects; Ryuk is perfect, as is Rem. The Shinigami interact with the actors very well. Sure, the CGI looks a LITTLE dated once in a while if you're actually searching for it; but mostly they look just like real, 3D versions of their manga counterparts. The music is well-placed and not overbearing.

My mother enjoyed these movies almost as much as myself, and she had never seen or read anything Death Note. I'd say it's a fairly safe place to start if you're looking into the story but comic books aren't really your thing.

As a last note, I want to add that if you can manage to purchase a copy of these movies that includes an English dub as I did, its worth it. The dub is of really high quality and the English-language voice-actors are very good. They are actually partially the same actors who dubbed the anime version of Death Note. (FYI: the English dub contains the F-word.)

  Some people may say the dubbing is terrible but you get used to it and the subtitles aren't that bad.

The other half is another movie, Death Note: The Last Name. Together, as I have said, they give you a much more satisfying ending to the story of Death Note.

They do an amazing job at integrating Ryuk into the movies, and by that, I mean the fact that Ryuk is CGI does not distract from or lessen in any way the awesomeness of this movie. Quite the contrary in fact, he is realistically created and motion capture technology was used in all of his movements, making him one of the best parts of this being a live-action movie.

3409869,4,B0017SVH5Q,"It was only recently that I watched the anime series that preceded this movie, and I will say that all of my comparisons are between this and the movie as I have not read the manga. It is possible the movie is truer to the manga, but I doubt it.

The movie overall is not bad, but as you would expect any lengthy piece of fiction being crammed into a two hour movie, they had to approach it from a different angle. The character portrayals are spot on, even Ryuk the shinigami, although the acting is a little over-the-top. They use the cliche of newspaper headlines multiple times throughout the movie to demonstrate the enormity and number of Kira's (the main character) crimes. The other thing that throws me is that they not only subtracted some storylines, but they added some new ones as well, which you don't usually expect in a film conversion. The movie starts with him in college, rather than high school, though he experiences much of the same events. However, he has a girlfriend with him for much of this movie that didn't exist at all in the anime. They also stretched out another character's role in the story (Naomi) and changed some names (pointless). They do keep the main arc of the story intact, and perhaps the new additions are just so fans would have something new they haven't already seen in the anime...I will admit it is kind of cool the way it works out. I think anybody that has done a little bit of research will realize that this movie does not really have its own ending, rather it is continued in the second film.

If you are not as fanatical about the anime as I am (it is the best), you can take or leave my review. The whole movie, I was commenting on how this was/wasn't like the anime...but if you just need some more Death Note in your life, I highly recommend it (though you really should watch the anime first and learn the story beginning to end with all its beautiful characters and nuances).",1311552000,,1935,4.447887323943662
3409870,1,B0017SVH5Q,"I cannot believe how many positive reviews this has gotten.

I love Deathnote.  I own both the manga and the anime.

If you've never watched the anime or read the manga: Please don't let this be your first Deathnote experience.  And don't be afraid if you've never watched/liked anime before.  I was never too into anime, and the first and only manga I have, and I immensely enjoy both.  I know movies can never quite live up to books, but this sets a new low standard.  I'm not a book snob, and I generally enjoy movie versions of books.  In fact, this is the only one I would refuse to ever watch again.  This is just an incredibly watered down version of something great.  You'll be missing out on lots of details, and the characters just lack any depth.  The dubbing is terrible, so you're essentially forced to watch with subtitles.  The English versions of both the anime and manga are excellent.  If your reason for getting this is because it's cheaper, save up the money for another media, get it on Netflix, borrow it from someone, or at the very least, buy this used.

If you've seen the anime or read the manga: Do yourself a favor and don't watch it, or at least don't buy it.  Both my husband and I were severely disappointed by it.  The storyline is SIGNIFICANTLY altered, and not in the way of just leaving out one part of the plot--they take it any completely change it.  There's much more detail in both the anime and manga that a movie just can't cover.  Everything in this just seems muted--Light doesn't seem as evil, L is lame, Ryuk is somehow more cartoon-y than in the animated version.  Everyone lacks personality, and the tension and heavy, dark feel just does not transfer over.

For those of you who have only seen the live action version, check out the other versions.  It puts this to shame.",1307923200,7,1820,4.47112462006079

It doesn't follow the mangas perfectly, like most film adaptations, but it by no means completely butchers it.  Oh, and Ryuk may look awkward at first, but you'll get used to him.

3409873,5,B0017SVH5Q,"After hacking into the police database, a young law student is horrified to see that the legal system is failing, and its criminals are being released without charge. Angered, he sets out to confront the criminals himself, but instead, he finds a mysterious notebook lying in the street: the Death Note. Amongst other rules, the book claims that any person whose name is written within its pages will be struck dead in seconds. Light is amused with the idea, and writes down the name of a murderer he saw on the television before going to sleep. The next day, Light awakens to the news that the same man was discovered dead from a heart attack. Realizing that he has the power of the gods in his hands, Light sets out to cleanse the world of evil using the book, but his ego quickly consumes him, and he begins killing anyone that threatens to oppose him. Now, a resourceful computer hacker that goes by the name of ""L"" has teamed with the police in order to expose the wayward vigilante and bring him to justice.

Based on the popular Japanese manga of the same name, DEATH NOTE is a high-powered parable that demonstrates how absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is told through an exciting murder mystery where there is no clear hero or villain. Light Yagami is noble at heart, but by superseding the court system and acting as judge, jury, and executioner, he has become that which he hates. L, on the other hand, seems to have the same fundamental beliefs in justice, but his true motives and intentions are never revealed in this first act. The deep philosophical questions that are raised by the Death Note reflect on society's views of good and evil, justice and immorality.

Tatsuya Fujiwara, who is best known for his lead in BATTLE ROYALE, captures the duality of Light's character perfectly. He is sincere in his nobility, but his ego prevents him from giving up his new found powers since he has become consumed with winning the battle of wits against L. This causes him to compromise his own ethics by killing the innocent police detectives that have gotten too close to the truth. Kenichi Matsuyama plays opposite of Fujiwara as L, whose odd appearance and awkward mannerisms make him a strange but interesting choice as the supposed hero. Each of their intricately-laid traps and foiled attempts to draw one another out into the open drives the mystery and suspense as they enter into a deadly game of cat and mouse.

Shusuke Kaneko has done an excellent job adapting the popular series on to the big screen, allowing DEATH NOTE to take #1 in the box offices in Japan upon its release and making it one of the strongest Japanese exports in years.

This was an interesting film with a thought provoking premise, however, I lost empathy for Light really quickly and that sort of killed my enjoyment. Light showed no remorse ever for the deaths he caused but instead seemed to revel in the attention and the challenge.

I am glad that I bought this dvd and am not disappointed in anyway what so ever with it. Light aka Kira comes across the Death Note one day while walking, already tired of how the justice system is he starts to take matters into his own hands as he soon finds out that anybodies name he writes in the book will die of a heart attack within 40 seconds as long as he knows what they look like. Soon he is killing criminals all over the world and the people start to rally behind him and his vigilante justice, but the FBI soon realize that all these people are some how connected due to the fact that so many people in such a little time are dying of heart attacks. Soon a mysterious detective by the name of L comes along and aids the FBI in tracking the growing legend Kira. What follows is a very well put together game of cat and mouse between Kira and L, it was so good it had me like ""DAMNNNNNN!!"" I didn't expect it to be that good. I can't wait to get my copy of Death Note 2 because at the end of Death Note - ATTENTION A SPOILER ALERT - L does not find out that Light is Kira and unknowingly invites him into his Kira finding task force. Also out of nowhere another Death Note is dropped and a young girl ends up with it so really who knows what could happen.

3409891,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I totally was expecting a subpar adaptation of the excellent anime series (first manga) DEATH NOTE, which, for those unfamiliar with the storyline, involves the vigilante-justice use of a death god's notebook by a brilliant student, and his self-corruption while using it as he tries to evade justice in the hounding form of a sugar-addict Gothy detective genius.

The anime was loads of fun, with cool music and excellent visuals. The manga was fun. And, hoorah, the film is terrific. I was not disappointed (except for the fact that there is an especially spoiled boy quality in the face/manner of the actor who plays Light Yagami, the death note wielder, that I found particularly annoying in spots, and effective in others.)

The story is told across two DVDs (this is the first part of the total story, which deviates in places from the other tellings). This one shows how Light Yagami obtains the notebook from the death god (shinigami) Ryuk (or Ryuuk or Ryuku, as I've seen various spellings). Ryuk is a blast to look at in all the media, and works really well in the film while still retaining his weirdness (especially the face). REM is also effectively rendered, btw, in the second dvd/flick. The young actor who portrays L is delightful in his portrayal of the unusual mannerismss and broody but low-key playful demeanor of the brilliant (and somewhat ruthless) detective who hides his name from Light. Were I a teen, I'd have a massive-crazy crush on him and his ruminative, sweets-loving self. As a middle-aged woman, I allow myself a minor crush. :)

The action moves at a good pace and the increasingly tense challenges that L and Light offer to each other are fun to watch--even knowing where the story goes. The two young actors work well against each other.

Be sure to see the conclusion in the second flick. It's equally enjoyable and resolves beautifully (and differently from the anime). I ordered the third live-action film (not part of the original storyline) just to see L again, despite the less than wonderful reviews. You can probably skip the third, but do not miss this one and the follow-up, DEATH NOTE II: The Last Word. I do not think  you will be disappointed, be you a fan of the characters/story or a total newbie to Death Note.

After several viewings and becoming more familiar with it, I fell in love with Fujiwara Tatsuya's Light, and Matsuyama Ken'ichi's L. Ryuk was a wonderful CGI animation job, and the movie overall was a pleasant take on the Death Note manga/anime canon, not that I object especially to the changes, as I feel it kept rather faithful to the spirit of the series.
I could see why some people would rather have it dubbed than subtitled, but for my two cents, I find subtitles easier (I'm a fast reader), and it's less distracting if the voices aren't out of synch with the mouth movements, not to mention the tones of the actors voices, I think, is preferable if one wanted to get a feeling for the characters.
All in all, this is a must-have for any Death Note fan who doesn't mind a little twist to their canon, and also enjoys live-action movies, too.",1233619200,,1031,4.347150259067358
3409893,4,B0017SVH5Q,"being really only a neonate in anime, meaning i really only watch what comes on adultswim and what i hear on the grapevine, i was really unsure that deathnote could be made into a full length movie. this had kept me from seeing it when it played in a few theatres not too far from my home. all i have to say is that i was dead wrong.

having finished reading the manga about shortly before the series ended stateside, i knew the basic plot and i kind of knew what to expect. light yagami finds the deathnote by happenstance, realizes it actually works and begins his crusade against injustice in society as kira, the name he has taken from his followers.

if you've watched the series, read the manga the above information is a given. what had really concerned me before i watched the movie was the pacing. as stated in other reviews, the first movie takes place over the span of 12 episodes in the anime, which comes out to about a running time of a little over four hours as compared to the two hours of the movie. needless to say, i was afraid the plot or characters were going to be underdeveloped and it would all fall apart under the weight of what it was trying to accomplish.

this also introduced a second concern along the same line. having watched the series, read the mangas and finally realizing where the movie was going to end in the grand scheme of things, (don't you just hate it when you know the alotted time can dictate the plot for you?) i was concerned about the ending point. i would imagine when completing the movies as they have chose to do, they would want to make sure that each movie ends with that classical cliffhanger or a resolution of sorts. going back to my knowledge of both the anime and manga, i just couldn't find the logical ending dynamic enough.

on both accounts though, i was thoroughly surprised. in reference to the time constraints, characterization is done beautifully. the ony complaint i have is the lack of characterization for L, but then again, i realize that he will step into the spotlight while all the other investigators fade and take more secondary roles (or maybe lower than that). furthermore, anime always seems to have a useless dialogue and the movie has seemed to streamline everything a bit creating a much more even flow.

as for my concern for the ending, two characters are given much more life to create the correct type of ending, an ending that is far different from that of the anime or manga, an ending that makes a great springboard for the next movie. overall, the ending was astounded me and i had thought i knew what i was in store for.

as for the other odds and ends, i was rather surprised that those the acted in the dubbed version of the anime do so as well in the movie. subtitles can also be limited translation japanese text rather than speech which is a nice touch.

after watching the first movie, i'm really curious to see the second. however, at this pace, i'm curious how many movies they will make to complete the whole? i thought i was through with deathnote, but alas, it has captured me for a second go.",1233360000,,3098,4.45326278659612

3409895,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Based on the manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide, ""Death Note"" the live action film makes its way to the US on DVD.

""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and the theme song ""Dani California"" by the popular band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
.

The film focuses on Light Yagami (Fujiwara), an intelligent student who wants to work in criminal law and follow his father's footsteps and catch criminals. But one day after hacking into the police department's computer system, Fujiwara is just sickened to know that the police has released criminals who should be incarcerated. One night, Yagami discovers a notebook called ""Death Note"" that has specific rules:

-The human whose name is written in this note shall die.

-This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in their
mind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name will
not be affected.

-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,
it will happen.

-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heart
attack.

-After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.

-This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches the
ground of (arrives in) the human world.

-The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner,
i.e. a god of death.

-The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.

Anxious to test this book out, Light writes the name of a criminal, thinking that the book is a joke. That is until the person's name that was written actually dies. Thus Light finds a way to get justice and does what he can to rid the world of all evil and become ""the God of the new world"". He also meets the owner of the Death Note, a shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk, who is fascinated by Light of his ways of killing the criminals but the way his mind works.

Light who uses the name ""Kira"" starts writing the names of criminals in the Death Note and each die by heart attack and thus causing a frenzy in the media and the police force who now need to go after the person killing the criminals. But Kira is not your average criminal, as he is quickly generating a large fandom of people who support Kira's goal of eliminating criminals.

Of course, the police force led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, has no idea of how to go after this criminal but unbeknownst to them is a mysterious person that goes by the name of L. An intelligent detective who has an unorthodox way of catching criminals and so far, has been very succesful with his cases worldwide.

The cat and mouse chase has begun as L goes after Kira and Kira realizes his greatest enemy is L and thus the battle begins.

The film stars an all-star cast with ""Battle Royale"" actor Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light Yagami, Kenichi Matsuyama who starred in films ""Linda Linda Linda"" and ""NANA"" as the mysterious detective L.

Joining the two is one of Japan's most popular actress, Asaka Seto as Naomi Misora, a former FBI agent who's fiance is killed by Kira. Model and actress Yu Kashii as Light's girlfriend Shiori Akino. Shigeki Hosokawa as FBI Agent Raye who is hot on the trail of catching Kira, actress Erika Toda who plays the character of pop star Misa Amane and Takeshi Kaga, best known for the host of the original ""Iron Chef"", who plays the role as Light's father and head of police, Soichiro Yagami.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is featured in 169 anamorphic widescreen and was originally shot in 35mm (1:85:1 ratio). My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk. And how that would translate on film and was quite pleased with the 3D character as it looks exactly like it does in the anime and manga series.

As for audio, the film is featured in both English and Japanese via digital 5.1 and 2.0 stereo. I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series. So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include a director's interview and the trailer to the film. Plus there is a trailer for the anime series and ""Viz Pictures presents"". The features are quite short but it was great to see an interview with director Shusuke Kaneko addressing the challenge the staff had to adapt the manga series to a live action film and what changes that had to be made.

I would have liked to see all features together as one featurette and a ""play all"" command but that's a minor quirp but nevertheless, I'm just happy there are special features on the DVD.

I was extremely pleased with the live version of the film. I expected that there would be slight deviations from the original manga and anime series because there is only so much you can pack into a two hour movie.

But even with the slight changes, everything worked out. The pacing was well done, the CGI of Ryuk was well done. But those changes from the original series is what gives the film it's own life.

Unlike the manga and anime series, Naomi Misora (Seto) has a slightly different role, as does Shiori Akino (Kashii) that plays a major pivotal role early in the series of how demented Light has become, even with a followup comment by Ryuk. Fantastic!

But the plus for this film was the talent involved. Tatsuya Fujiwara is such an impressive actor that it was great to see him take on the role of Light Yagami. To see Fujiwara's acting show the believable and caring Light Yagami evolve into the killer known as Kira was just fantastic. Kenichi Matsuyama as L was also well done.

But of course, the addition of other talents such as Asaka Seto. She's such a popular TV drama and film star that it was great to see her as the vengeful Naomi Misora and it's great to see Mr. ""Iron Chef"" Takeshi Kaga as Soichiro Yagami.

I was extremely pleased with the first live action film and the treatment it has received on DVD. I enjoyed watching it in Japanese but watching it again with the voice actors of the original anime series. Again, I'm not fond with English dubbing for a lot of Asian films but VIZ was smart in utilizing the voice actors for the anime series on this live film. Well done!

I highly recommended this DVD! Fantastic!",1227484800,,6938,4.532425940752602

I was actually expecting the Japanese version with subs (which I had seen previously via the internet over 10 times), but I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a dub with the anime dub's voices. The original movie was excellent, and while the dub feels a little more comedic (if your not used to seeing peoples words not match their mouth's movements, it's funny for a bit), it's still amazing. Fans of both the original and the anime will enjoy this, despite the awkward mouth-movements-cannot-fit-dubbed-over-voices-properly thing. It's still cool - if you love Death Note, you'll love this! :3 (Don't shun the dub just because it's a dub!)",1222041600,2,745,4.7384615384615385

3409901,5,B0017SVH5Q,"Death Note is based on the popular manga (Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I saw the anime series on imported dvd, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan in a while. I will review both films because one movie while phenomenal and definitely can stand on its own, the story is very much linked together.

Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:
In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.

In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami (Death God), brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.
As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.
That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts absolutely--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?

Man has no right to play GOD.
This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films. Some may say that the film also contains a social commentary.

The battle of wits between L and Light Yagami is definitely one to watch; as the two geniuses struggle to stay one step ahead of the other. It is rather curious that such a complex match-up of intelligence also proves that the two are actually two sides of the same coin but on opposing sides. L is pretty much a charming if eccentric presence as the sugar-loving detective. I didn't know that sugar does provide energy for the brain until I observed him gulp down significant amounts of candy and dessert. The thing that proves Light Yagami quite dangerous is the fact that he believes that he is doing the right thing and whatever steps he has taken may seem cruel, it is justified. When one believes his cause his just, one becomes more determined than the common opponent.

Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual with a very solid structure. The direction by Shusuke Kaneko effectively promotes intense energy and never lets up on the suspense, further accentuated by its twists and turns. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is pretty intense, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass other films in terms of plot) I will stop here, since with this film, the less you know, the better it would be.

Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  Stars]

3409902,5,B0017SVH5Q,"I'm a huge fan of both the anime and the manga (It's my current obsession) so when I got the chance to go see the movie in theaters, I was ecstatic. I'll admit, the dubbing looked a bit...goofy, but that didn't change the fact that it was just as awesome as the Manga/Anime. Truth me told, I was recovering from eye surgery when I went to see it, so the fact that it was dubbed was a blessing, since it meant I didn't have to try and read subtitle. Another bonus was getting to hear L's wonderful dub voice while seeing the adorable L in the movie. XD

On a serious note, I hope hey release ""Last Name"" and ""LChange The World"" as well. I've only seen ""Death Note"", and really want to see the other two.

I recommend this DVD for any fan of Death Note, or anyone who enjoys a good psychological suspense movie. It realy makes you think!
