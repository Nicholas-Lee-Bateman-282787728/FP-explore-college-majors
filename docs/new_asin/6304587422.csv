7874893,3,6304587422,"I enjoyed this dark comedy by  S. Ray, a great director. You have to
go with the slower pace, and with his special way of depicting persons
 living  in a world where jobs are scarce, population large and even
growing, and young people are ""tempted"" to move to other nations just to get
away from the negativity and general malaise. BUt there' s quite a bit of
comedy here too and many human touches. Ultimately, a real work of art.
I give it three stars, but it seems even better than that, given its pacing,
and wonderful portrayal of a citywide crisis.",1395964800,,554,4.411764705882353
7874894,5,6304587422,"Often overlooked, this is simply one of Ray's masterpieces. This movie uncovers the veneer of 'respectability' that the 'middle class Bengali' is so proud of.
Ray is cynical in this story about middle class Bengalis (= Indians) caught up in the struggle between morality and survival. The 'hero' of the movie is a college graduate who got poor marks in his final examination because the examiner could not 'afford' to buy proper spectacles (glasses) and because his handwriting was 'too small'. His low examination scores sets him up for a life of failure. Within the first 20 minutes, Ray has set the stage and explained everything wrong with the economic system in India.
Once you have 'poor scores' in your exams in India, you are doomed to fail, unless you have 'connections'.
The rest of the film shows the inevitable downward drift of the protagonist into the world of corruption. The movie is set against the backdrop of the turbulent 70's in Calcutta, when there was an armed leftist uprising which all but destroyed the fragile economy, and was crushed by a corript but powerful government.
Ray's subtle retelling of history will stand the test of time.
The acting in this movie is outstanding, especially of Pradip Mukherjee, Utpal Banerjee and Robi Ghosh ( a popular comedian in commercial Bengali cinema).
Not well known in the West, this is actually one of Ray's best movies. I lived through the 70's and 80's in Calcutta, and I can identify with each and every character in the movie.
The false moral fabric of 'middle-class Indians' is very well exposed.
This is a must see for movie buffs.
I appreciate this movie more, every time I see it.",1356739200,,1656,4.814035087719298
7874895,5,6304587422,"I would urge Luanne to see this film again and this time paying attention will definitely help. This is a very tough film with a big city backdrop and like all other Ray films there is no agenda as such... this film is a beautiful and moving portrayal of the hard truths of being a young man in 70's Calcutta, with ideals that are often conflicting but somehow forces one to go on and make a living.
It is beautifully filmed with a telling narative with typical subtlety known only from Satyajit Ray. It is about being compassionate, about the loss of innocence and the conflict between idealism and corruption. The quiet urgency and emotional intensity of the film transcend its context. It is not only a film about India. Just like other Ray masterpieces, it is quite universal.",1036540800,3,780,4.618705035971223
7874896,5,6304587422,"I was initially dissuaded from purchasing this video because the only review that I had to go by, was the critic's review. The movie is not, as he states ""for die-hard Ray fans only"" but rather, for anyone who appreciates a good, well-made film. While it is true that the subject matter deals with corruption, and yes, this is not a Disney film and not for everyone, it is really a shame not to see it. Ray uses some wonderful cinematographic techniques, such as focusing in on the father's face for an extended period of time, to convey an emotion, to bring us this character's feelings without stating them outright. The soundtrack, as in all of Ray's other films, is wonderfully evocative of the scenes which he is presenting. The movie is well-made, and will keep your interest. You must see it!",1022630400,,799,4.633802816901408
7874897,5,6304587422,"I love Ray's films and this is one of his best.  How does a country, a city, a company, a man, become corrupt?  This is the story of one man's defining moment when he stands at the edge of the abyss and must decide which path he'll take.
The story begins with a scene of this young man taking his university exams and when given the opportunity to cheat, makes the decision not to.  So we start with an honorable person of principal and by the end of the film he is given another opportunity to make another decision that will change his life forever.
This film shows us all of the challenges, disappointments, roadblocks that young people in this time and place experienced and does so very effectively.  We share his frustration, his confusion, his hope and his joy when he believes he has found one pathway to the bright tomorrow he seeks.
And as each of the shining prospects turns into something other than what he thought he was choosing, we see his struggle to convince himself that things aren't what he is afraid they might just be.  Until the facades drop all together and he is left looking at the ugly reality of the situation he confronts.
As always, Ray takes one man's experience and successfully translates it to the world at large.  Which fork will he take?  I hope you will see it and find out.",986688000,5,1312,4.441666666666666
7874898,5,6304587422,"The first time I watched ""The Middleman"" was back in the eighties on T.V in my home town Calcutta. Very few movies leave a long  lasting impression on me, and this is one of those few. Set in Calcutta,  India, in the days of economic uncertainty in  the post independent India,  the main character passes his College degree exam, and tries for a job. He  is torn between idealism of his father, who wants to see him as a scholar  and intellectual, and honest professional, and the realities of the economy  and the job market situation, he struggles to make a living. He gets in the  business of order supply, which intrinsically seems to involve lies,  corruption, humiliation and betrayals of small kinds. But all those small  but impactful daily events transforms him, he learns to get used to the  ways of middleman, until he gets in a situation where in order to win a  order supply bid, he had to arrange for a prostitute for the business man  empowered to make the decision. This puts him in moral dilemma and this  dilemma sharpens to an extremely painful climax when he discovers that the  girl who he is going to supply was the sister of his best friend. The last  scene when he comes back home, with a look of a real middleman entrenched  in misery of moral dilemma, the difficulty of not able to see his caring  sister-in-law in the eyes, is particularly telling of the inner struggle  and the helpless submission to the reality. This movie brings out our  eternal struggle within ourselves between compromise and the idealism,  between trust and self-deprecation, between faith in the system, and  nonchalance.
Although set in 1960's contemporary Calcutta, the appeal of  this movie, and the underlying conflicts, and realism, transcend time and  locality, and it is a must see for any one interested in understanding how  we human beings progress in our lives or digress and be ridden with  conscience , and conflicts.",965606400,4,1932,4.743975903614458
7874899,5,6304587422,"Although I had long been aware of Satyajit Ray's reputation, living near the video stores of a large Indian community in the USA (Devon Ave. ring a bell with anyone?) gave me the unfair perception that Indian cinema  consists solely of mass-appeal escapist musicals that I would watch  primarily for their camp potential. But from the time I first read of  ""The Middleman"" several years ago I was intrigued, and finally  got around to watching it recently. I was stunned. Almost immediately you  can tell that Ray is a cinemagraphic genius. The movie is a masterpiece of  realism: if you like the classic Italian film ""The Bicycle  Thief"", you must see ""The Middleman"". While it shares the  critical attitude and something of the style of the best neo-realist works,  its indictments are more nuanced, and Ray is not afraid of ambiguity or  humor in a ""serious"" look at society. Everything--photography,  sound, editing, music, dialogue, story, acting--is tight, expressive and  supremely restrained. This single movie backed up every superlative I had  ever heard lavished on Ray, and then some; and I get the impression that  this is one of his *minor* films. I can't wait to watch the rest.",960768000,3,1193,4.959595959595959
7874900,5,6304587422,"Middleman is the story of millions of brilliant Indians who lead thier lives with extreme austerity,classiness and sophistication while stuck in a country whose population is four times that of the US and the land area  one-fifth of US. No other country can have the same class and  dignity  under such pressure. This movie is a testimonial to the greatness of the  Indian people. Seriously,if you are a seeker to the question ,that,'Which is  the world's best culture -the answer is INDIAN' and see this movie  to get  a sample of that. Jai Hind.",960768000,6,547,4.75531914893617
