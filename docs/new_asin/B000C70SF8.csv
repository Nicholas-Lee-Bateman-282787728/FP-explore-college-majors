8135483,5,B000C70SF8,Michael Doucet is the best known of the Cajun fiddlers. He teaches in an easy to understand way. Great dvd!,1359676800,,107,4.4
8135484,5,B000C70SF8,"A great introduction to Cajun fiddling, which is not only very rewarding on its own, but a major component of modern Nashville session fiddle work. The video gives slow demos of every song, which is then broken down with all the sticking points gone over very carefully. The song is then demonstrated up to speed, just like most Homespun lessons. A tip to purchasers like the last reviewer: go to the homespun tapes website and watch the sample, then check out the lesson difficulty rating at the top of the product description. Be honest with yourself: there is a link with all you need to determine your skill level. This one is classified as a level 3, which means you know the basics of playing the fiddle (intonation, bowing, and so forth) and want to learn the specific style (Cajun) and some songs. The instructor still breaks things down a bit, but takes some basic skills for granted. For would be Cajun fiddlers, I'm afraid I don't know of any very basic material in this style. Your best bet would be a country folk resource to get your skills up (or better yet, an instructor). For anyone who can play basic melodies and is comfortable with a shuffle bowing pattern and in tune enough for a lot of drone strings, this is a GREAT video!",1314662400,4,1247,4.546666666666667
8135485,1,B000C70SF8,I'm just beginning to try to learn to play the fiddle and I am interested in the Cajun fiddle style. My expectations for this instructional d v d were far too high. It turns out there are only about 4 minutes of actual instruction on this d v d and the rest is Mr. Doucet demonstrating his skill at playing fiddle. His manner is gentle and that is nice. His fingering on the finger board is well videoed. It also would have been helpfull if he had tuned the fiddle down like is usually done by cajun fiddle students who don't have the skills that Mr. Doucet has.,1281312000,4,562,4.212962962962963
8135486,5,B000C70SF8,"Being a life-long musician, I had decided to learn to play the fiddle and started with Michael Doucet's set of CD's.
I find them easy to follow, but I suspect they may be a bit more challenging if you don't already play an instrument.
He presents a song, starting at a rudimentary but essential version and builds on it.  The nice thing is that it presents a level that is appropriate to begin rehearsing, or even performing, and offers countless variations that you can learn as you progress in skill level.
I've been working on CD #1 for a couple weeks now and it's been fun ""catching-on""!  I actually thought that this instrument would be more difficult than it is, at least in order to achieve the fundamental Cajun sounds, thanks to Michael's excellent instruction!
I'd definitely recommend this instruction set :-)",1201219200,4,820,4.767605633802817
