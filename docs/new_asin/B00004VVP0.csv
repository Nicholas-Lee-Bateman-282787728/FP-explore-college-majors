1358810,1,B00004VVP0,"I completely agree with McNamara's review. This is more a narrative with pictures than a dramatic film. For dramatization, try 'The Bible ... in the beginning' by J. Huston or 'Noah', from the BBC's 'Bible in animation' series. It is incongruous to depict the Creation and paradise in an almost desert environment. The film 'drags' slowly through the stories we know so well from the Book of Genisis. There are some redeeming features however. Some of the filming is very artistic, with some stunning visuals. I believe that E. Morricone composed the score for the film. You will be treated to wonderful back-ground music, with a middle-east flavour.",982368000,,650,5.027777777777778

1358813,5,B00004VVP0,"A cinematic wonder to behold! Breathtaking clarity and an illustrated, big-screen depiction of the biblical GENESIS Creation, as seen through the lens of a movie camera. Starting at GENESIS 1:1 - which states: ""In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, ""Let there be light"": And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light - Day, and the darkness He called - Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, ""Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."" And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament - Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And God said, ""Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear"": and it was so. And God called the dry land - Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called He - Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth"": and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, ""Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth"": and it was so. And God made two great lights; and the greater light (the Sun) to rule the day, and the lesser light (the Moon) to rule the night: He (the Lord) made the stars, also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And God said, ""Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that they may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."" And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl (birds) after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."" And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing and the beast of the earth after their kind"": and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: And God saw that it was good. And God said, ""Let us make man in Our image, after Our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping that creepeth upon the earth."" So God created man in his own image in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, ""Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."" And God said, ""Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat"": and it was so. And saw every thing that he made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He (the Lord) rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all His work which God created and made (GENESIS 1:1 - 2:3 KJV). This magnificent and miraculous account, straight from the Book of GENESIS within the Old Testament of the Holy Bible, is narrated by: Paul Scofield. And, this color, single-disc, DVD, beautifully depicts the beginnings of GENESIS and on too and through the Great Flood. In which, Noah and his family and two of each selected animal, were spared and saved from utter aquatic annihilation (Genesis 5:32-9:17 KJV). Filmed in Morocco, the natural scenery is calming and mesmerizing in aesthetic appreciation. And genuinely flows with biblical accuracy and concise scripting, as is written within the Holy Word of God. This dramatic, innovative and narrative film is further enhanced by Actor - Omero Antonutti, whose English voice is also narrated by: Paul Scofield. The soothing music was composed and directed by: Ennio Moricone, and the film itself, is by: Ermanno Olmi. This novel DVD uniquely focuses on the biblical Creation, known as: GENESIS. And presents the viewing audience with a historical, archaeological, scientific and scripturally accurate depiction of creation, the world and all that dwells, therein (Psalm 24:1-2 KJV). A visually stunning motion picture that provides leisurely entertainment and superbly fascinating, education. A picturesque, movie, drama that is worthy of you viewing time, which also makes a great gift. Nina Kish",1412985600,,6087,4.421193232413179

It's a few people not even acting, they are just moping around except for the part where the ark is built and their is one man that basically reads out Bible verses. This is awful and a sham. I cannot believe they actually took the time to create this and the viewers who gave this so-called movie a good rating are deceived and are not saying the truth.

I started watching my DVDs and decided to watch this one at night. Yes, it knocks me out at night but to the beauty and serenity it provides. You see what goes on with Cain & Able and with Noah's Ark. The narration is deep and refreshing.

This movies isn't 100% accurate because it is portrayed a bit differently from what the bible says but it is still very beautiful and peaceful. At times, the movie felt like a surreal dream. You get a feel of how they lived, surrounded by God's creation, nature, peace, etc. In this movie, the people don't talk much, except for the narrator.

1358828,1,B00004VVP0,The Bible - Genesis is a visual film about Genisis and was filmed in 2000. The problem is the slow pace and many of the scenes have really nothing to do with the story telling. I must admit that I was quite disappointed and I only watched the first 40 minutes since the movie was like a sleeping pill. The narration was dull and uninspiring and the acting was wooden. The music sounded like muzak more then that of a soundtrack to a movie. Not recommended. 1/5.,1347408000,3,461,4.310344827586207
1358829,5,B00004VVP0,"The story of creation all the way through to the covenant made between God and man, symbolized by the beautiful rainbow.

The story begins with the creation of Man and Woman, the sin committed by Adam, and how the snake deceived Eve, which led to the panishment of the Earth. The story continues with the first crime committed by mankind, Cain's murder of his brother, the condemnation of God, mankind's corruption and evil, and God's regret for having created earth. The choice of Noah, a just and upright man to build the Ark, the flood and its clearing the way for a new mankind, the pact of the eternal Covenant between God and all living beings, are told through the clear and simple words of an old nomad shepherd.

It's so beautifu to see God's love in all the way!!! No matter what we do! He is not stop to love us and forgive us becouse he payed our sins alredy in the cross!! The Heaven is a free gift if you able to recive it!",1295827200,,937,4.318181818181818
1358830,5,B00004VVP0,"I got this movie in the set I bought a couple of years ago and didn't watch it all that time because I thought the negative reviews indicated I wouldn't like the movie either. However, I found the movie to be a very reverent telling of the first few chapters of Genesis.
I thought that it portrayed well how the O.T. was likely transmitted orally before it was recorded.
I was moved at the respect the people had for their patriarch as he shared the word of God with them.
The music and cinematography were very moving.
I would like to have the kind of peace in my life that those people portrayed; and it seemed that God's word was first on their list of priorities.",1255564800,9,667,4.301587301587301
1358831,2,B00004VVP0,"This is possibly one of the most boring Bible movies I've ever seen in my life. It's slow, the scenes aren't really that interesting and why the decision to go verbatim I'll never understand. It wasn't really necessary. If you were to use this as a tool for those who are new to the stories, you'd lose them. It's just that boring. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.

The best part of the whole film is maybe Noah's Ark, but it wasn't really enough to save the film.

The dubbing over wasn't really that good, but I'll forgive it that. There are better Genesis movies; or it's just best to break it up into smaller stories to get a better understanding of this important book in the Bible.",1225238400,,693,4.323076923076923

1358835,5,B00004VVP0,The deluge of actions pact stories makes us miss the sublime.  That is not the case in this film.  The film works at capturing the ugliness of sin and the sublime beauty of the Word of the Lord.  Give it a chance.,1159920000,3,213,4.023809523809524
1358836,1,B00004VVP0,"Yes, I was disappointed in this video, and I regret purchasing it.  I also expected more of it, having enjoyed very much previous releases like Esther, Jeremiah, and Solomon.  Much of my disappointment was in discovering that most of it was not a dramatization;  the scenes being viewed often did not relate to the story being told, and this reduces the video's usefulness as a teaching tool for Bible study.  I differ with some previous reviewers in that I felt there was not enough concern for Biblical accuracy in some spots, notably in the story of the flood.  Noah's ark as pictured did not appear to be of the dimensions or shape clearly described in Genesis 6:14-16.  Genesis 7:13 lists 8 persons who entered the ark;  the grandchildren of Noah were not born until after they left the ark when the flood had abated.  In the movie, there appears to be a small crowd getting on board the ark, including a lot of children.  And all those leaks in the roof of the ark that could be seen constantly dripping do not make sense at all:  if Noah was a good enough builder to build a vessel that was seaworthy and did not leak below the water line, why is there any reason to think he was incapable of building its roof to not leak?  After all, he followed God's instructions (""according to all that God commanded him, so did he"" Gen. 6:22), applying tar both inside and outside the ark (Gen. 6:14).  These scenes do not respect the details of the story as given in the book of Genesis.  What is the point of claiming to make a movie based on the Bible, and then not basing it on the Bible?",1135728000,32,1588,4.397260273972603
1358837,4,B00004VVP0,"I must admit when first watching this, I was feeling dissapointed in that it's not entirely like the other movies in the Bible series. However, once getting into it I began to see why it was made how it was.

Nowhere in the movie is there a date as to when the old man or his family were living. It shows how the story of Creation up to the Flood were passed on from genertion to generation. Families knew their history beyond their own generation (something lost in our culture). This is how it was done back in the day. Remember there was a time when Scripture was not yet written down. It was preserved and kept in this fashion. Cool thing, the Hebrews had common understanding of the Lord, without anything written. Ever wonder how the Israelites in Egypt would know who the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is? Because it was passed on.

With that in mind, this makes for a great movie. The quiet parts give time to reflect on God's creation. God cares about all of it, not just people. He said that all He had made was good.",1120780800,9,1030,4.304123711340206
1358838,4,B00004VVP0,"This Ermanini Olmo film is filled with magical moments, taken at a leisurely pace; if your usual viewing fare is action packed and music video speed, you might want to pass this one by.
The visual beauty of the panoramic Moroccan landscapes and its handsome people are wonderful to watch, but the main attraction here is the narration by the great Paul Scofield (""A Man for all Seasons"") in a poetic reading of this section of the Bible.
The script fairly accurately follows the first nine chapters of Genesis, with a few added portions, like excerpts from the Song of Solomon, Leviticus Ch. 26, and Psalm 50.
Omero Antonutti plays ""the grandfather"" and ""Noah"", and the rest of the cast are simply listed as ""people of Morocco"". The children are exquisite, and the costuming gives the feeling of ancient nomadic times.
The score by Ennio Morricone includes tribal folk music and predominantly, the strange and glorious sound of ""Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares"".
I find this film extraordinarily soothing, and the words are like music and calming to the mind and soul; I like to put this film on while I am working, or when I just want to turn the frantic tempo of today's world down a notch.",1070841600,9,1189,4.69377990430622

1358842,5,B00004VVP0,"Very personal presentation of the biblical account of the creation and the flood by Ermanno Olmi, the acclaimed director of ""The Tree of Wooden Clogs."" Boring only for those who have no poetic sense whatever! The above average artistic refinement (from the visuals -stunning not to say more- to the very choice of the music) and spiritual depths of the movie will disconcert some. But the movie is a masterpiece. Slow? Yes. Meditative? Yes. Is it a sin? No. It's a hommage. And what a hommage! The spectator is called to make the biblical account his own. Comparing that movie with other biblical stories on characters such as Solomon, Esther or Jeremiah misses the point. Any movie director that would treat the first chapters of Genesis like just another story (although extraordinary) would fail to do justive to its true nature.
The Book of Genesis is a spiritual monument -not a historical book, like the Book of Samuel or the Book of Kings. It doesn't mean nothing of it happened. It did happen. Creation is part of history. But the biblical author here does not provide us so much with a word for word description of how things happened than help us understand God's loving providence at work in His creation. Not only does John Huston's litteral treatment of Eve handing the apple over to Adam (in ""The Bible,"" his 1996 version of the Book of Genesis) add nothing to the text. It is purely anecdotic. It has nothing to do with us. The existential (and spiritual) tragedy of sin is totally eclipsed. No action movie will ever capture what goes on deep within man's heart (and soul) each time man turns his back on the one who made him.
In other words, the purpose of the biblical creation account is not scientific (HOW the world was made) but theological (WHY the world was made.) God made the world out of love. The world is beautiful because, as St John himself wrote, ""God is love."" Ermanno Olmi's movie does justice to the biblical account precisely because it reveals to us something of the primeval beauty of the world as it came out from the hands of its creator. Anyone dismayed by the hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the spiritual antidote in this quiet but colorful, richly textured movie.",1020297600,26,2238,4.726342710997442
