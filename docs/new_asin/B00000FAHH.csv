1209282,5,B00000FAHH,"David Macaulay's video series has to be one of the best introductions to some of the major architectural achievements in the ancient world.  Combining animation with live-action shots of historic sites is a stroke of brilliance as both work hand-in-hand to enhance the viewer's comprehension of the architectural, social, and historical importance of the subjects Macaulay describes.  David Macaulay, himself, is a wonderful host on this guide through the ancient world.  There are four videos in this series:  Pyramid, Roman City, Cathedral, and Castle, and I highly recommend them all.",980121600,6,587,5.488888888888889
1209283,5,B00000FAHH,"Okay, I showed the first 2/3rds of the film to my high school students, and then they came back during lunch to watch the ending!  An animated story line ties together a very good look at the how and why of various  important functions and considerations of planning a Roman city.  The  audio-visual work is high class!  Some adults expressed regret that there  wasn't more animation!  They enjoyed the story telling as well as the  students.  Make learning fun, add this to your collection!",949536000,32,491,4.75
1209284,4,B00000FAHH,"I first saw this series on PBS, and was captivated. David Macaulay uses animation, and an easy going, informative narration to tell the story. While some younger viewers {mine} would like to have seen more animation, i  felt it was used in the right proportion to convey the story of building a  new Roman city.  Mr. Macaulay also provides new insights to how these  cities were planned and constructed in ways that may surprise how many  things they took into consideration {i.e. stepping stones across streets}.  A great video that teaches without becoming boring for young viewers.",949449600,7,584,4.969072164948454
1209365,5,B00000FAHH,I saw this years ago and really enjoyed Macaulay's way of combining historical documentary with a relevant fictional storyline -very enjoyable.,1365465600,,143,5.857142857142857
1209366,4,B00000FAHH,Just the right length to fill a normal fifty minute class period (no small praise) and just the right mix of education and adventure.  Good for any Latin or World History classroom.,1354233600,,181,4.65625
1209367,5,B00000FAHH,I purchased this DVD to replace a boxed set that disappeared from my classroom. Students really enjoy this DVD because it combines an animated story with real life video.,1351987200,,170,4.896551724137931
1209368,2,B00000FAHH,"I thought this would be a documentary of Roman Buildings and such, but it had an animated story intermingled in the docu.  The cartoon was scary for my little ones.  We're learning about the Roman Empire in school, but this is a poor choice for small children.  I'm sure it hits the target for Jr. High/High School Students.  We'll save it for later.",1334016000,,350,4.507936507936508
1209369,3,B00000FAHH,"The book this is based on is a wonder book - from beginning to end we see how a city is built, how it is run, and how daily life is in a Roman City.  Wonderful, fun, good for boys or girls.  The DVD tries to put a story in there - and it takes up alot of the time instead of explaining about how the city was built.  I want to see them making the roads, designing the sewers, the crowded marketplaces, the busy streets, the water system!  And yet we get a story.  True, Brian Blessed is one of the voices, and the author does give us a tour of some Roman ruins while explaining how the cities worked but still, the book is better.  Kids may still enjoy the DVD, but only if you give it to them BEFORE the book.  And I do suggest getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-A-Story-of-Roman-Planning-and-Construction/dp/0395349222/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City: A Story of Roman Planning and Construction</a>.  It is worth it.  I suggest getting this DVD if you are interested in Roman history, daily life or just anything Roman.",1269302400,2,1074,4.889502762430939
1209370,5,B00000FAHH,Brings history to life for middle and high school students as well as myself. It arrived in perfect condition and sooner than promised.,1259452800,,135,4.913043478260869
1209371,5,B00000FAHH,"Adding to information covered in David Macaulay's earlier book of the same topic and giving an extensive back story not found there, Roman City travels back to just before the time of Christ and depicts the design and creation of a city in Gaul: modern-day France. The animation here is of a superior quality to past versions of Macaulay's books and the story of the founding of the city, a subversive movement by local Celtic druids, and the plot to take the life of the visiting Caesar Augustus, all of these are new to the film. There is much to be learned from Macaulay's continuing series and this is one more excellent volume in the collection.",1197331200,,650,4.612068965517241
1209372,3,B00000FAHH,"While I liked the Mcaulay's narration and exploration of the Roman cities featured, I really was put off by the animated part of the movie. The story line was predictable and bland; I did not like the art at all, and I thought it trivialized the entire video to the degree that my husband and I (both in our 40ies) were close to turning it off. Kudos to Macaulay for his work, but I hope somebody will stop him from dummying down his videos in the future with annoying animation!",1183939200,2,479,4.333333333333333
1209373,4,B00000FAHH,"I found this documentary very interesting, and no a bit dry or dull, as one might expect it to be.
This is due in part to the use of animation to further increase viewers' understanding of the Roman City and history.  I felt that this aspect of the video might make it more viewable for children.
While it does not delve deeply into Roman history, it does cover as many aspects of the Roman City as can be expected in 60 minutes.
Extremely informative and fun, I would recommend this video to adults and children alike because it lays a fair foundation for understanding ancient Rome.  The documentary also does not focus strictly on architecture, but also discusses Rome's control of other areas, such as Gaul, and guesses at the points of view of the conquered through the animated story.
While I did find David Macaulay's attempts at jokes slightly gauche, they did not take away from the overall educational, intriguing quality of the documentary.
While I assume that the animated sections of the film would make it more appealing to teachers and students, I also found that these sections contained educational value as well.  Still, I would say that the informative, live-action segments of the film are more useful on the subject.
Overall, this is a great documentary explaining the Roman City in a format people of all ages can enjoy.",1081728000,2,1342,4.775862068965517

7907961,5,B00000FAHH,"In 1994 I watched this special on PBS and I enjoyed the contrast of the computer coloured hand drawn animation and the hand drawn animation without the colour! That along with the narration by David Macaulay and the voice of Derek Jocobi as the voice of Marcus Fabriceus, archectect of the Roman city held my attention in spite of the wavy reception of channel 21 and UHF!

 Many years later I have now watched this special on DVD and I enjoy it all the more! Then hand drawn animation was valued for it`s educational strenghs!  Last  night I watched ""Walt Disney , an american experience"" and I  became excited all over again for hand drawn animation! The cgi is really monotonous! The 1990's hand drawn animated specials are superior! Hand drawn animation is combined with computer coloring and pencil drawings with movement for a starting effect! Very effective!",1442275200,,865,4.8175675675675675
7907962,5,B00000FAHH,"Many, many years ago I taped this series from TV.  I still have the tapes.  But when I saw they were on DVD I had to have them.  I even have a couple of the books.  The books and DVDs are great for children as well as adults.  They are informative as well as entertaining.  The are in an animated form, but not a feel of being a cartoon.  I put all of them--Roman City, Castle, Cathedral, Pyramid in the same category--worth the money.  There is even one that they didn't have back then--Mill Times.  I now have all of them and still enjoy them.",1432080000,,545,4.114285714285714

7907964,4,B00000FAHH,"Good CD, but there are less details than the associated book ""City: A Story of Roman Planning and Construction"". It did not cover all the ideas as in the book. It lags behind it. Usually watching videos is more fun than reading a book about the same subject. Not this one.",1418169600,,272,4.352941176470588
7907965,4,B00000FAHH,"This is my favorite of all the David Macaulay films based on his books.  The animated backstory is easily the most interesting and compelling out of all those found in the films, although it takes certain liberties with the facts (I am not aware of any assassination plot against Augustus by the Gauls, for instance).  Another quibble would be that MacAulay describes the Roman apartment houses (insulae) as ""well-built"" and ""virtually fireproof.""  Not according to the primary sources, they weren't.  In fact, it seemed to be a kind of running joke in Roman towns that the insulae were going to either collapse or burn at one time or another and the only way to save yourself from disaster was to not be there when it happened.  Quibbles aside, though, this is great stuff for all ages.  I've used it in college classes and no one seems put off by the fact that I am showing them a ""cartoon.""",1413849600,,893,4.620253164556962
7907966,5,B00000FAHH,"Derek Jacobi,  Brian Blessed, John Hurt, Sian Phillips,  these are just a few of the excellent actors that bring to life the animated and highly entertaining portions of this PBS DVD.  David Macaulay is the architect, writer, historian and entertainer who first brought us the books and then this wonderful entertaining and teaching video.  The dialogue and presentation is ""par excel lance"".  Buy it !",1394236800,,402,5.123076923076923
7907967,5,B00000FAHH,One of the best parts of this video was the transition from current day ruins to a portrayal of what the city (or area of the city) would have looked like during its heydey.,1391558400,,173,4.117647058823529
7907968,2,B00000FAHH,We tried this one and the egyptian one in this series and were hoping to use them for homeschool.  I don't mind that there was cartoon animation... but if it is geared towards the ages it seems to be speaking to then the nudity and unnecessarily mature content ruined it. It was not really ideal for adults or children since the cartoon sucked out time something of interest could have been better communicated.  There are ways to communicate the facts of the culture without stooping to almost comic book storylines. We will not be using these and just wanted to give the heads-up for anyone who may feel the same when sharing with elementary school ages. So disappointed since we really enjoy many of his books and the dvds on cathedrals and dams...,1373328000,3,751,4.639097744360902
7907969,4,B00000FAHH,"Roman City combines footage of Pompei as a city and very good explanations of how hypocausts and aquaducts were constructed along with explanations of how the Romans kept their cities supplied with water. At first I was not sure how to take the animated story of the Romans in Gaul, as it seemed disconnected from the David Macaulay narrative, but as the animation continues it gives a view of Roman domination over Gaul and corrupt Roman governors which enhances understanding of the Roman Empire. One of the things I liked most about the video is the inclusion of footage of Ostia Antiqua. This is a Roman city (the  old port of Rome) which is only 30mins from the city of Rome and has some sections that are the equal in interest to some sections of Pompei. Everyone knows about Pompei but few know about Ostia, and it has some ruins such as the carefully delineated mosaic floor market place, the horrea, and the insulae which are different from Pompei. At last someone has discovered it. The video is already a bit dated, but an invaluable educational tool.",1372550400,2,1062,4.679144385026738
