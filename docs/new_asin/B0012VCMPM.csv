This offers a wide variety of the old time westerns at a price that can't be beat, in fact you might even call it a robbery.  would recomend this to anyone with a desire to return to yesteryear!",1231718400,6,278,4.148148148148148
3098844,1,B0012VCMPM,I was disappointed to find that when I received the DVDs that there are no subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired and there was no notation on the product description to that effect.,1231286400,7,190,4.617647058823529
3098845,3,B0012VCMPM,I have not seen every episode but I did review Stoney Burke and Wide Country. The film is old and I wish that it was remastered as it was dark and you could not see the credits at all. The audio is good. Wide Country was a better copy. I am hoping the rest are too.,1227916800,3,265,3.75
3098846,5,B0012VCMPM,"Without having seen every episode in this collection (it could take some months), I can already  recommend it as a source of some real historical TV gems.

As mentioned elsewhere, it's a treat to see The Cisco Kid episodes as they were originally filmed in color. And wait 'til you see my childhood favorite, The Roy Rogers Show. In one episode, a pre-Magnificent Seven Charles Bronson, billed as Charles Buchinsky, is seen as a boxer. In another, there is a young Denver Pyle, beardless and before he grew into the beloved, grizzled character actor we knew later. There are even some original commercials with Roy and Dale pushing sugar-laden sponsors such as Post Sugar Crisp, and recruiting some of their youngsters to somewhat awkwardly sing the Jello Instant Pudding song. It's worth noting that the quality of the Rogers shows on this disc is significantly better than some I've seen released by other companies.

Overall, the production values and print quality in this collection vary significantly. The upside is that some are better than you might expect, given their age. Besides, as Gabby Hayes might have put it, who in tarnation would expect digitally-restored perfection in this sort of collection, anyway?

Thanks to Mill Creek Entertainment for providing this paydirt. Now we can sit back and enjoy sifting through it for our personal treasures. Highly recommended.",1226880000,26,1382,5.101769911504425

3098854,3,B0012VCMPM,"First of all, if you are a TV Western fan, this is one heck of a set. There's 300 episodes from a wide variety of Fifties and Sixties TV shows, and the picture and sound quality for the most part are not too bad.

Having said that, I recommend that anyone buying this set takes the time to check all 24 discs to see if they load properly or play properly in your DVD player. Since these are double-sided discs, that means checking 48 sides!

I've sent two sets of this title back to Amazon already. In the first set, the following discs would not load: 5 (B), 15 (B), 19 (B) & 20 (B).  In the second set, the following discs would not load: 5 (B), 15 (A), 19 (B) & 20 (B). At that point, I gave up and did not check the rest of the discs in the second set. Both sets were returned and Amazon was professional about it.

So, if you are like me, and want to see all the 300 episodes that you paid for, check each disc in your DVD player when your set arrives. If you can get a set that is defect-free, then you have gotten yourself a real low-priced treasure trove of great TV viewing.",1247270400,70,1083,4.023255813953488
