Kinda dated movie. If you didn't grow up then or live during that period as a teen or older you would probably think what a gross bunch of people. Anyway, this was kind of a TV-like movie. The ending had a decent moral premise I guess . . . but honestly all that sex and sex ed stuff . . . obsession back then with kids and parents was just that . . . an obsession. It was blown out of proportion as everyone wanted to break some taboo of talking about sex. So they just over talked it. It was nonsense. Regardless this movie was lost on me and even if I was a kid seeing it would be lost on me too. We all have hormones but some of have control over them and don't need to be taught how to.",1441152000,2,989,3.7777777777777777

I finally had to pick this up on dvd since the vhs doesn't work anymore and I'm so glad that I did. I almost see this as a tribute to Who's The Boss as there are a lot of themes in this film from the show. So if you are as big a fan as I am of that show I'm sure you'll pick up on them and enjoy the movie even more. All in all this is one of my top favorite movies of all time and really takes me back to my childhood.

My husband wasn't ""quite"" as bad as Danza's character but came close, especially when our daughter began to receive phones call from boys in her middle school years and beyond.  ONLY HE was allowed to answer the phone (he thought) and when he did, and unsuspecting young man asked to speak to our daughter, he would always say (and very stern, low and gruff) ""May I ask what this is in reference to?""  Nine times out of ten, the young man who hang up and our daughter would wail, ""Dad!!!""  To all fathers of daughters out there, this is a instruction manual for what's to come (if it hasn't already).

One day their daughter is a little child, the one man in her life is her father.  And then the hormones kick in and she turns into a young woman.  And then boys start to notice her and she starts to notice boys.  And father gets really really REALLY jealous and there's nothing he can do about it except watch it happen despite.  Tony Danza plays an everyman (as he does in every project he's ever done), watching just such a horror story unfold.

There's Family Guy-style gags with Simpson looking at his daughter! Ami Dolenz looks great in a blue bathing suit! She runs on a beach in slow motion a la 10(1979).

With Tony Danza playing a nervous insecure father trying to cope with his teenage daughter's new found dating life and comming of age changes. This is a cute and funny film which is sometimes rediculous and over the top. I don't believe this film is ment for younger than age 13.,1299628800,,420,4.397435897435898

Don't let the title fool you, this is a great family friendly comedy that never ventures into unwanted territory. Most of the comedy arises from the fact that Danza's character has an overactive imagination.

Great fun for parents with teens or teens with parents :)

Danza does get a little wacky in the movie, but that's part of its charm.  There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie including the scenes with that mastermind Dr. Fishbinder.  See it at least for the hot Ami Dolenz on the beach.  Put it on your list if you're an '80s freak.",1165795200,,440,4.069767441860465

I recommend this film to anyone that enjoys  a fun film. It has it's own charm about it, plus all dads should watch this film. A dad's worse nightmare of his nerdyish daughter getting a make over and suddenly become a babe. Lots of wanna  be dates...a must watch.

The scene on the beach when Ami does a some what bay watch like run to her dad's horror is classic!!!

It is well-paced, and rich in the soundtrack of the sixties, since Dad is a DJ.  Wallace Shawn is priceless as the know-it-all Psychiatrist specializing in adolescents.
