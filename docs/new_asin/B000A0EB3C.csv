8071119,3,B000A0EB3C,"Two friends, Romeo and Gavin, are saved from a one-sided fight by an odd local named Morell. Because of this act, the two young men befriend the older fellow, but soon things sour when Morell creepily begins asking out Romeo's older sister, Ladine. Intensifying the situation is Gavin, who plays a joke on Morell in an attempt to ridicule him in from of Ladine. This is the breaking point for Morell, who decides to attack Romeo's family in a fit of rage.

A solid, underground piece of cinema that I recommend to anyone who enjoys character-driven stories. It combines humor and drama in a very entertaining way that makes for a craving the revisit it for another viewing.

8071120,4,B000A0EB3C,"If audience has watched ""Sweet Sixteen"" by Ken Loach, then you would have an idea of what this movie is all about.  It revolves around two young best friends who live next door to one another in those typical English estate housing.  One is black and the other one is white.  The black boy is brought up by a single mother and he lives with her sister.  The white boy is the only child in the family and naturally, he's overprotected by the parents.  One day, upon being beaten up by two teenagers, a stranger comes to their rescue.  He becomes their fast and fond friends.  The stranger, in the beginning looks harmless and mentally slow.  As the movie progresses, we start to realise the underlying violence that the stranger is capable of.  And because of him as well, the relationship between the black and the white boys become estranged.  Another substory is that the black boy's violent father comes home to roost and he wants to have a second chance to redeem himself.  In the way, audience shall see how he would change the dynamics of the storyline.  The gist of the movie is to see the relationships between the two main characters gotten tested.  Bob Hoskins probably appears for a few minutes in the movie, which is quite forgettable, really.  Overall, a movie that's suspenseful and never dull to watch.  A great promise for this new Director.  Highly recommended.  By the way, no extra features.",1148515200,3,1410,4.6437246963562755
