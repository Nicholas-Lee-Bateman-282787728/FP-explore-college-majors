I would buy this video,it's worth your time and money, plus you'll be looking good on the dance floor",1186272000,,171,5.37037037037037
8055938,5,B0008F6IMG,"This is an advance rutine.  The movements are very sexy and it can be appreciated the knowledge and experience of the instrutor.  Some steps takes considerable space, so they may not be suitable when dancing in a crowd place.  Anyhow the movements provide a lot of ideas for creation of modified versions of the rutines.  I consider this an excellent DVD, for people who are seriously into salsa.",1151539200,2,396,4.779411764705882
8055939,5,B0008F6IMG,"In my collection of forty DVDs, there's no other quite like this one. To call it a mere salsa styling video, I think, is understating it a bit. Jaana Kunitz-very sweet and likeable-teaches an entire solo routine the like of which I haven't seen on any instructional DVD so far. It isn't just a bunch of New York shines and little touches to the basic elements. It's a fantastic routine performed to perfection.

I don't believe this routine can be done by beginners. First, you have to get the isolations right otherwise you'll just be doing the footwork and not the whole lot of the movements. Second, you have to understand the rhythm of the salsa music to be able to use this routine with any other music. After four years, I still find the routine challenging.

The routine's been divided into three segments. With her very charming accent, Jaana breaks the instruction into several modes. She teaches the count-with a front and a back view-then gets into the footwork. This part is really the easiest. Next she teaches the ""body work"", the hip and rib cage moves. This is the tough part. Finally, the arm and hand styling that garnish the moves.  The very Latin attitude of the whole routine is really attractive.

The instruction does tend to go by too fast in some places. Also, I think the filming could have focused more on clearer, sharper visibility. I'm reluctant to give this DVD anything less than 5 points though because I think nothing detracts from the uniqueness of this video.",1125619200,5,1495,4.694656488549619
