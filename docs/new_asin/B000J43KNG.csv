2666879,5,B000J43KNG,"As a 22 year, and now retired, fitness instructor, I was in search of video / DVDs that I could take with me when I travel for business.

When I first began with Core Rhythms I never thought I would ""get it"".  Not being much of a dancer, the moves were very difficult for me to coordinate, and I spent much of my time just trying to learn the moves.

Fast forward 6 months, I have the entire series, and LOVE them all!  I am quite proficient now, and the better I get at the moves, the harder the series becomes, as I am able to move my arms, hips, and ribcage to their fullest.

All I can say is... try it, and stick with it, no matter how silly you may feel for a while.  The results will be worth it!",1200528000,14,703,3.915492957746479
2666880,1,B000J43KNG,"I thought the intro package was great, but it went downhill from there. The intro package has a long and short workout. The rest of the videos have only the long workout. In total I have 5 of these videos. They do mix it up with some dance moves, but many, many of the the moves are march-in-place- repetitive. DanceSport LLC customer service is TERRIBLE! It took them 3 tries to get my address corrected. I sent back a duplicate product but they never did give me credit for it. Kept me on hold for up to 30 minutes at a time too when I had to call; and I had to call at least 8 times!",1187568000,8,586,4.017094017094017

2666882,4,B000J43KNG,This is a good core Rhythms Exercise DVD'S.  Love all the Core Rhythms but must confess my favorite Exercise DVD's of everything I have is Turbo Jam.  Order them from Goodwill in perfect condition.,1405296000,,197,4.764705882352941
2666883,1,B000J43KNG,"The product was delivered on time, not damaged. However, the routine shown in the dvd was basically a repetition form other series.
You don't have to buy several series of core rhythm, I guess.",1399334400,,193,4.705882352941177
2666884,5,B000J43KNG,If your looking for an exercise DVD then this will do the job. I know you want to lose weight and get in shape but making sure you are healthy enough by talking to your PCP to make sure you can do the workout that is on this DVD.,1366934400,,229,3.693877551020408
2666885,5,B000J43KNG,i was very happy with the whole process. the service was fast and i got exactly what i had ordered,1363651200,,98,3.95
2666886,5,B000J43KNG,"hi everyone! i am really pleased with this dvd. one of the things that i have problems with is core. but thes videos make it fun. the instructore are julia powers,and jaana kunitz and they make working your core fun. one of the things i recomend doing is watching the video first and then tayloring the video to fit your needs. talk to your doctor first , but once you do that than go for it. i found these videos to be a whole new way of working the area that we all have trouble with.

good luck.",1361404800,,498,4.081632653061225
2666887,4,B000J43KNG,This really works your core. Moves a little fast but still a good workout! I would recommend this video to younger women.,1361232000,,121,4.545454545454546
2666888,5,B000J43KNG,The entire Core Rhythms series is good for anyone who hates exercising but loves dancing. Recommended by my ballroom dancing instructor.,1360195200,4,136,5.523809523809524
2666889,4,B000J43KNG,"I purchased several different DVD ""Dance"" workouts. Many were too focused on the dance (poor workout), and forgot that males do not move like that (physical or societal). The Core Rhythms series does a great job of providing a workout, while teaching dance along the way. They also have a male in the video, to demonstrate the male bias to a given move.",1354752000,,353,4.619047619047619
2666890,5,B000J43KNG,A great fun way to loose weight.  Buy all their DVD!!  The Blonde I call her little fire cracker!  She's give you the energy!  A great addition to your DVD collection!!,1350086400,2,168,4.32258064516129
2666891,1,B000J43KNG,I thought I was buying something like zumba. NOT! I would not have purchased this dvd if I had watched it before hand.,1341446400,,118,4.173913043478261
2666892,5,B000J43KNG,The item was exactly how they had described it. It came on time and am very please with my service.,1329436800,,99,4.0
2666893,3,B000J43KNG,"this video is ok. not what i was looking for but i did get a pretty good core workout out of it. i was after a zumba type workout. this has some zumba moves, its simple and easy to follow. just not zumba.",1319500800,,204,3.7674418604651163
2666894,5,B000J43KNG,"If you want a fun dance workout, this is it!  I get a great ab workout, plus cardio.  I am at an intermediate-advanced level and thought it was great!  It would benefit beginners through advanced.  Either slow down or do it full out and your heart will be pumping!  Don't expect to get the steps down the first time unless you are a dancer.  But part of the fun is learning what to do and it takes your mind off of the work.  Once you get the hang of it, you will have amazing abs!!!!  It is definitely worth the price!!!  Lots of fun.",1286150400,,535,4.0673076923076925
2666895,5,B000J43KNG,"I bought this dvd.  The first time I worked out, 40 minutes went buy and it seemed like 10 minutes.  Don't get me wrong it is challenging but totally fun and you will be sweating big time.  Each time I find myself getting better and getting the rhythm also.  I love it.  Tyler, Texas",1249516800,3,283,4.166666666666667
2666896,5,B000J43KNG,Very upbeat.  Clear and direct instruction and demonstration.  You can keep going even if you haven't yet mastered all of the moves.  The front/rear views make it very easy to understand how to do the moves.  If you keep it up you will see great results.,1228780800,4,254,4.456521739130435
2666897,4,B000J43KNG,"This workout is fun.  I found myself smiling the whole time. It is much more difficult than the original workout.  I was sweating in the warm up.  There is more jumping than I expected, but they do mention low impact options where you can step rather than jump.",1218585600,2,261,4.395833333333333
2666898,4,B000J43KNG,"I have the 4 DVD original set of Core Rhythms and like it. But I wanted more variety so I bought the Club Mix set. Swing Sensation is a riot! I found myself smiling while I did it all the way through. It is a challenge but the music is good, the moves are fun, and BOY does it burn calories. I burned almost 400 doing this workout (I was wearing one pound ankle weights and one pound gloves). The workout is about 35 minutes long with a warm up and a cool down, making the entire thing 45 minutes.

The setting is the same as other Core Rhtytms workouts. I was hoping for something a little more ""clubby"" seeing this is a club mix. But the music is way better and louder and the moves are much more fun. The marching in place is to lower the heart rate a bit and ready you for the next move. I have no problem going back to home base and marching a little after killing myself doing a tough set.

This one is by far my favorite. I really enjoy the swing music and the moves. One caution though. They do a lot of hopping type moves which may jar the joints. They don't tell you how to modify so, if you feel it in your knees, modify so you don't jar them. My knee is a little sore today but I'm not going to modify just yet.

The whole set is really good but Swing Sensation is fun, challenging, different, and sexy!

I gave it 4 stars only because there are high impact moves that should be addressed with modifications for those who need them. Otherwise, it's a blast!",1216684800,11,1469,4.072664359861592
2666899,5,B000J43KNG,"Please disregard CTY ""ConnectToYou""'s review (that they posted on all discs, prompting me to do the same). They seem to have a problem mostly with the company, not the DVDs. I never buy direct as these kind of organizations are known to be slimy, and I recommend that you purchase from a third party as well.

I love dance workouts as they are fun and educational and therefore I will actually do them. These are the best. You MUST start with the starter kit ""kick start"" disc to learn the moves. It's a workout in itself! Then you can progress to the extremely challenging dance workouts. The girls do go very fast and don't give you a lot of verbal cues, but you have more visual assist (in the camera views) than you could ever need. You WILL feel a change in your body from doing these regularly! I can't say enough about them, BUY THEM ALL!",1216166400,7,845,4.382165605095541
