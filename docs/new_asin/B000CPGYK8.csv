8117996,1,B000CPGYK8,"While briefly discussing the importance of being psycologically prepared and have good money management (something he does not go into), Steve Sarnoff spends the better part of 35 minutes (not 55 as claimed) telling us how much money one can make buying call and put options through his options hotline service, claiming he consistently offers high probability advice in leveraging options.

While this may fool the novice, anyone who has read ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options"" (most brokers require you read this before starting a margin account that is required to purchase options), will know that what he says is easy to know and freely available. He offers no advice on how to mitigate risk or any of the more complex options strategies, only telling us that one can benefit from his options hotline and buying and selling calls. Which, by itself, can be extremely risky.
