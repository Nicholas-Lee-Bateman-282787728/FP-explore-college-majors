2349557,5,B000A1IVUK,"I can't imagine many people under the age of 40 caring about this one unless they are film students and even then only those who have some interest in this genre.

However, I grew up during the golden age of TV cowboys (1950s and 60s).  I watched Cheyenne Bodie, Roy Rogers, Bat Masterson, the Maverick brothers, Josh Randall, Lucas McCain, Paladin, Matt Dillon, the Cartwrights, and all the rest of those guys.  I watched them with my dad who told me about Gene Autry, Tom Mix, Lash, Hoppie (I never saw him on TV), and the guys I had missed in the movies.  I had to settle for John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies (which was ok and I didn't feel cheated at all).  Watching this DVD not only brought back a flood of memories of childhood but of my dad and my grandfathers.

I really didn't expect this to be as good as it was or affect me as deeply as it did.  I showed to my dad who immediately got a copy for my uncle (big Gene Autry fan) and my wife got one for her mom (Hoppie was her childhood hero).

I believe this program is very important if just to remind us how important the Cowboy image was in the collective consciousness of twentieth century America.  If you grew up anywhere from 1910 through the 1960s, this can't help but affect you.",1187136000,3,1252,4.271186440677966
2349558,5,B000A1IVUK,"""When Cowboys Were King"" is a wonderful piece of nostalgia for those of us to whom these ""Kings"" were friends in the 40s and 50s.  Those ""shoot-um-ups"" are still fun to watch--good clean entertainment that drew a clear line between good and evil; the good always prevailed.  We knew, even then, that was not always the case, but the reality of things did not diminish our enjoyment of this fine entertainment.  God bless 'em everyone.",1167782400,,434,4.76
2349559,5,B000A1IVUK,If you are a big fan or even a casual fan of westerns this DVD is for you. It traces the evolution of the western from one-reel silent movies to the modern era and documents how they have changed over the years in both presentaion and theme. The old footage alone of John Wayne as a singing cowboy and the story of how many of the early stars often had to do dangerous stunts in their films alone is worth seeing. So if you are a western movie person don't miss this wonderful documentary!,1158364800,4,489,4.212765957446808

8072189,4,B000A1IVUK,"This is a nice eight film set of B-series Westerns from the 1930s and early 1940s, featuring oaters starring Buck Jones, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter, Johnny Mack Brown, Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry. For those who enjoy classic B Westerns these films are self-recommending. VCI has for a number of years taken care to locate and release classic examples of the B-Western genre, and these will give any interested viewer a good sampling. Most of these films appear to be in the public domain. The quality varies, from simply acceptable to good, due most likely to the fact that these films were taken off either aged 16mm  or (in some cases) 35mm film stock. But aficionados of B-Westerns will still enjoy them despite video imperfections.

VCI continues to make important films, including the richness of the Western, available to the public. The Kit Parker collection, the films of Robert Lippert, and others, are now seeing the light of day, in some cases for the first time in sixty years, and for that VCI deserves the thanks of contemporary viewers.",1441238400,5,1060,4.850828729281768

8072193,5,B000A1IVUK,"I really didn't expect much from this, given the fact that it was from the History Channel.  Too often their DVDs are superficial and contain a plethora of rhetorical questions rather than facts.  However, this turned out to be a very fine overview of the western movie, and TV program from the first oater by Edison, to the glut of the genre on TV in the 1950s, to the present day.

Anyone who has ever enjoyed these American morality dramas (that's what westerns really are) should enjoy this.  Gene Autry and Roy Rogers ride again, along with a good many other hombres and sidewinders who are almost forgotten now.",1302307200,,617,4.63302752293578
8072194,5,B000A1IVUK,"For all of us who LOVE Westerns, particularly the ""B"" Westerns, this is a great peak at the history and names that made the West come alive on our local movie screens or TV screens.  The only problem is that there is so much to cover and so little time.  Based on the limits the producers had to have, they did a great job and would recommend this DVD.  Nice to pop it in and remember what it was like back when we all wanted to be straight shooters like our heroes on the screen.",1291161600,3,480,4.031578947368421
