1848675,4,B00008K77M,"Heather Greco is out shopping with her mother Chantal (Laura Press) and hints at being in trouble; but before she can describe the problem she is run down by a car, which we see on screen. Three months later, Chantal decides to sell the apartment and Lacey Farrell (Emma Samms) is the realtor / estate agent given the task. Curtis Caldwell (Hannes Jaenicke) shows great interest in the sale; but Chantal has discovered Heather's journal which makes it clear that she was murdered. She therefore withdraws from the sale while she investigates, hoping to persuade the police that her daughter's death was not an accidental hit-and-run. Then Caldwell returns and kills Chantal, taking the journal with him. But Chantal has taken out the key pages and Lacey discovers these and takes them to the police. Because Caldwell knows that Lacey has seen him, he hunts her down so that Lacey has to go into the Witness Protection program and moved to Minnesota. Chantal's ex-husband Jimmy Greco (Reiner Schne) has a photocopy of the key journal pages from Lacey, but they are difficult to read because they are bloodstained. So Jimmy and the police hunt down Caldwell while Lacey makes a new friend in Minnesota. This is an exciting thriller, though I did feel that Lacey's sister showed more angst about the situation than Lacey herself.",1351728000,,1326,4.897777777777778

1848677,3,B00008K77M,"This is a damsel-in-jeopardy flick featuring atmosphere shots of New York, where the film's heroine, finding herself witness to a murder, is put into witness protection and sent to Minneapolis.  For some reason, the police there allow her to speak with relatives via cell phone, and she tells her sister where she is, simply because the sister wants her to.  I believe the sister emphasized her need by weeping.  The sister then for no apparent reason buys a Minneapolis newspaper, which immediately falls into the hands of the murderer, who loses no time in getting there.  Throughout all this, the heroine gripes and anguishes over her loss of identity, etc., when what probably should concern her most is her own stupidity.  Along the way, she engineers a meeting with a Minneapolis radio personality, who later in the film seems to provide a key piece of eyewitness knowledge useful in identifying who is behind the New York murder.  I seem to have missed the explanation for his part in the East Coast events, for I thought the radio guy was in Minneapolis all the time.  And more puzzling, how the cops just happened to pick his town in which to sequester our heroine.  The film is presented competently but in no way creatively or with humor.  It is basically a mediocre to sub-par TV episode stretched to an hour and half.",1323907200,,1330,4.747826086956522
1848678,4,B00008K77M,"The pattern of the previous films of this series by Ms Clark is partly broken. The main character is not a radio anchorwoman but a female real estate agent. We are not dealing here with a serial killer but with a real hit man hired by a dirty soiled trafficker who appears slightly ambiguous because his secular but not criminal boss, who he cheats, is Italian, or has some kind of an Italian name. But it does not have anything to do with the mafia. The whole business is a cover up operation for a first murder that the police sloppily classified as being an accident. There the pattern is not broken. The police is still sloppy. What's more the police does not succeed where a simple woman, by taking risks and using her intelligence, baits the hit man and the rotten egg out of the basket in which they were hiding. The suspense is OK though of course we know from the very start what the stakes are and we are only missing the name of the man who is ordering these murders. The police  will arrive just on time when it is needed not to get into more complicated business. And yet the whole film is built around a leak in the police protection of the main character and we will never know how this leak happened and where it came from. The police is always sloppy with Ms Clark, but Ms Clark is also sloppy on some basic logical elements.

7984810,3,B00008K77M,"This movie Pretend You Don't See Her is very lacking compared to the book. I think Emma Samms is a good actress. Howvever, the producers of this movie left out so much of the character development between Lacey Farrell and Ken Lynch, that I felt cheated out of a good movie.

However, if you haven't read the book, you might enjoy the movie.",1397606400,,341,4.412698412698413
