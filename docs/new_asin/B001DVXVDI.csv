8295012,5,B001DVXVDI,"Roy Williams is a master of teaching fast break basketball and there is no doubt that a big part of the restoration of UNC basketball to its prized place in college basketball is in large part due to the style of offense the Tar Heels play, namely, up tempo fast break basketball.  The Tar Heels are consistently one of the leaders in team offense each season.

A big part of why the Tar Heels are so effective with their offensive transition game is not their 2-on-1, 3-on-1 or 3-on-2 fast break attacks, it is the smooth transition from fast breaking into a half court offense that allows the Tar Heels to obtain so many easy baskets while the defense is attempting to get organized after stopping the initial offensive push up the court.

This transition is obtained by running secondary breaks. Coach Williams shows and tells how the Tar Heels achieve their success with secondary break offense. Some topics covered include running off a turnover, missed shot and after a made basket.

Each player's position is covered as well as what each player must do while running the floor.  Coach Williams also shows a variety of secondary break sets and plays with suggestions on how and when to use each.

If you want to play fast and score a lot of points, you need to see the contents of this DVD.
