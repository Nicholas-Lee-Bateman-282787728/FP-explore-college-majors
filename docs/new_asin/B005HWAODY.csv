4706085,4,B005HWAODY,"In early July of 2010, YouTube and Ridley Scott's Scott Free Productions launched a project asking the popular website's users to submit videos of themselves, filmed on July 24. The goal was to collect as many videos from as many different places in the world and compile the best ones into a sort of video art piece directed by Kevin Macdonald. The response, as one might imagine, was overwhelming, with 80,000 submissions from 192 countries totaling over 4,500 hours of footage, and the result was Life in a Day. It would be easy to dismiss something like this as a mere indulgence, inaccessible and inscrutable to most who might attempt a viewing, but I felt differently; Life in a Day ultimately proved to be a rather moving and poignant experience for me. This film may be a thought-provoking capsule of daily life everywhere on Earth, or it may simply be a stream of consciousness glimpse at an increasingly tech-savvy generation; it's up t you to see for yourself and decide.",1320710400,2,982,4.7823529411764705
4706086,5,B005HWAODY,"Producing this movie was a monumental task. People from around the world were asked to shoot a short video on July 24, 2010 and upload it to youtube. I actually participated in this project, my video wasn't selected for the final movie but it was fun none the less. I watched the premiere of the movie, they streamed it live on youtube, it was very moving. I hope they do it again.",1320710400,,381,4.305555555555555
4706087,5,B005HWAODY,"Because this movie was created overwhelmingly by people, it is difficult to judge and rate; therefore, I judge it's humanistic value - and this movie excels. The one factor that as done ""professionally"" was the editing - and while good, the editing is not the focus nor is it distracting from the film. Therefore, the editing is too minimal to judge or rate... leaving only the humanistic value unscathed at a 5.0. This is a movie about people by people.",1320019200,8,454,4.6875
4706088,4,B005HWAODY,"The documentary, Life in a Day, by Kevin Macdonald was very interesting and entertaining, and I would recommend it to anyone. People from all around the world sent him videos, and he composed them all together to create this movie about one specific day. This documentary elicits many emotions from its viewers, because it shows many different parts and aspects of the world, and it really makes viewers appreciate what they have. The movie was not at all polemical, because even the people who had difficult lives were living, and the videos shown were sympathetic and interesting. There were people that were happy and celebrating, and there were also people who were moribund. Some people were going through an honest day of work, and others were complicit in an illegal act. The extreme variations among these videos made the movie so diverse and entertaining to watch.",1317600000,16,873,4.986301369863014
4706089,5,B005HWAODY,I love this. I use it when teaching about cultural differences in human development. Cant beat the price as educational videos are very pricey!!! I have paid in excess of $150 for a video for my classes but this wonderful production gives me something very current and culturally appropriate. Brings up much discussion and thought among my students.,1456963200,,349,5.0344827586206895
4706090,3,B005HWAODY,Some very adult scenes such as cows being slaughtered and a son telling his parents he has a boyfriend. Watched it with my 11 and 13 year old. Probably shouldn't have,1453161600,,166,4.387096774193548
4706091,5,B005HWAODY,I've never felt more human walking away from a movie. This film inspires me to understand other people and other cultures with a renewed gusto and makes me truly understand what it's like to share this world with others.,1450828800,,220,4.666666666666667

4706101,3,B005HWAODY,"YouTube is for celebrity music videos/dead celebrity graves/movie trailers & heaven only knows where they get the rest.  (never did find the YouTube video of Kenny Chesney w/Victoria's Secret models - not wholesome enough for his teeny boppers fans?)...I digress...The film was Ok, but not even close to some real documentaries.  GROW UP all of you who can't deal w/how your steaks magically appear at the butcher's.  Did you think cows were sang lullabies until they went to sleep & peacefully died?  Not even close to what atrocities people in 3rd world nations suffer...",1402444800,,573,5.0638297872340425
4706102,2,B005HWAODY,"For some strange reason the seller sliced a section of the case off the back area above the UPC code.  Maybe this would not matter to a private individual, but I ordered this (a patron requested it) to circulate in a library so now I have to re-case the item.  When an item is listed as new it should be in new condition.",1394496000,,321,4.079365079365079
4706103,4,B005HWAODY,I greatly enjoyed this movie and used it for a reflective exercise but was disappointed that there is not an option for subtitles. There are subtitles for when the person is speaking a non-english language but you can not turn on subtitles for the whole movie.,1390348800,,260,4.673913043478261
4706104,5,B005HWAODY,My son introduced our family to this movie and we all enjoyed it very much.  It was a gift for him since he loved this movie.  It was so interesting to see how life is lived in the lives of people from all around the world. It was not only interesting but endearing too.,1390262400,,270,3.9814814814814814
4706105,5,B005HWAODY,"This movie is simple yet very profound. It is a journey through life, as lived by various members of the human race. There is a deep connection with the people in the movie because the underlying emotions and reasons are so universal, yet there is also a strong sense of wonderment at the diversity of life human life on this planet.

I was so moved by this the first time I watched it that I purchased it for some of my friends as gifts. Great movie, definitely one that can be viewed again and again. The music, the editing and the selection of scenes all contribute to the overall power of the movie.",1389571200,,603,4.336283185840708
4706106,4,B005HWAODY,"I first watched this on Netflix, and watched it a few times more later, and decided I had to buy it. It is a riveting, eye opening, uplifting documentary that is definitely worth watching!",1380931200,,188,4.5588235294117645
4706107,5,B005HWAODY,"This is one of my favorite movies because I am a people watcher anyways. I like to try to figure people out and I love finding out little details about people, and this movie is basically a gold-mine for that. Life In A Day is not just a happy-go-lucky movie either, there is substance and it's beautiful.",1377648000,,305,4.368421052631579
4706108,5,B005HWAODY,"This documentary is something that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. I don't remember exactly how it was I stumbled upon this movie but after seeing it, one thing was clear, I HAD to own this movie! I felt like, everything I've ever felt about life, about people, about the world was validated in this film. I felt connected to the rest of the world. I've always wondered about what was going on in the rest of the world that wouldn't normally be seen. Not the CNN or even the BBC version, but the untold, small town, middle of nowhere village, stories that are out there begging to be told! This was everything I needed it to be and more! I don't think I've been more in love with a documentary!
Life in a day is broad, simplistic, & beautiful!",1363737600,,764,4.34965034965035
4706109,1,B005HWAODY,what's wrong with that? I bought it as a respect act for the director Ridley scptt. in Italy we were even able to see it. Only with youtube. and it gets out only region a?!?!?,1361145600,,175,4.0285714285714285
4706110,5,B005HWAODY,"A very well made film of life in a day on planet earth.  The soundtrack is also wonderful and we just bought that here as well!
Very moving images and worth a watch for those who do not need drama and violence thrown at them to keep their attention!",1356220800,,249,4.081632653061225
4706111,5,B005HWAODY,"This is a difficult movie to write a review for since it isn't footage from one person, but rather many many people. You will laugh, you will cry. It captures the beauty in the everyday routines like waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, commuting, etc. You will see how people all over the world live their lives and the struggles they go through and what makes them tick. I got this DVD as an anniversary present for my husband because we got married on July 24, 2010, the day all the snippets of footage in this film were shot.",1345420800,2,532,4.383838383838384
4706112,5,B005HWAODY,"Prompt delivery, good DVD but haven't really watched all of it yet. It's about life in a day for people around the earth",1331769600,,120,4.260869565217392
4706113,1,B005HWAODY,"The concept of this documentary was made with good intentions... But it turns out to be just a really long video blog full of ordinary people asking the viewer to care and find interest in their lives. Sure there are some beautiful moments... but overall it's just very boring. Throw in a cow getting shot in the head followed by its decapitation - which served no real purpose, and a NYC guy coming out to his grandmother over the phone (which was a fake call that he acted out - he continues to try his hand at relevance on YouTube) and you have a very long vlog that ultimately makes you realize your own life is actually far more interesting than the people you just wasted your time watching live theirs.",1331251200,6,709,4.419847328244275
4706114,5,B005HWAODY,"`Life in a Day' attempts to show us what a typical day in the life of the world would go.  The call was made, the commission sent out and the world responded.  What happened to you on July 24th, 2010?  Well, if you want to know what happened to the rest of the world all you have to do it watch this movie.  While some may find this a tad grading, I especially found it somewhat affirming.  It felt very genuine and sincere, and the clips used were inspired in the fact that they really showed life as it generally can be seen.  Does anything special happen on any random day?  Probably not, but the way that it is constructed in this documentary makes it feel special.  It's life; and life is special.  Some of the clips are more intriguing than others, and I really hated the closing clip (don't try so hard to tell us your message; we already felt it) but as a whole `Life in a Day' moves briskly and speaks volumes.",1331251200,,919,4.2057142857142855
4706115,5,B005HWAODY,"This is an amazing feat by You-Tube and National Geographic. The idea of piecing one day from around the world into quick snapshots is wonderful. This film takes you around the world; getting an inside peak into troubled times (breast cancer), to the simple joys of life (a camp fire). You can see yourself in other cultures in the smiles and laughing to the heartache of feeling alone and lost. A very moving conglomeration of people and places pulled together from hours and hours of footage into this one movie. You realize again, how close we really are and alike to each other; the family we make as one.",1327276800,2,609,4.5963302752293576
4706116,5,B005HWAODY,vERY GOOD MOVIE.lOVED IT!!!!!!! ITS A MUST WATCH.VERY Happy with my purchase and the fast shippment. Everything was perfect. thanks,1326672000,,131,5.6

4706118,5,B005HWAODY,"Life in a Day, directed by Kevin Macdonald is a spectacular movie about the different cultures on our planet.  It's really incredible how different everyone on our planet is, how some people act, how some people live is so inspirational.  There were many different people shown in this movie.  The most incredible and motivational was a man from Korea biking around the world.  The film crew did an exceptional job in getting different angles and different views of gigantic crowds, following a single person running through a city, and just in general getting videos around the world.
 Earth is full of different species of animals, plants, bacteria and more.  I think the weirdest of them all is humans.  Every one of us is different and everyone thinks that one culture is either wrong or strange.  Examples of this are the Israeli and Arab conflict.  There was one scene that really grabbed my attention.  There was a man probably in his early to mid-twenties they showed him doing parkour, parkour is a kind of running where you try and get somewhere as fast as possible.  It involves jumping off of high bases and balancing on basically nothing.  This though fun to watch was not what caught my attention.  After all of his running he walks into a grocery store and starts looking around, he picks up food, takes it and leaves.  He does not pay doesn't give them anything.  This shows how some people live in basically nothing and need to steal to survive.
 There was, at one point, a part about what people most love.  Basically the whole part was a slideshow of people stating their most loved things on earth.  Some people said family, some said life, it is incredible how many various responses you get.  There was also a segment on what people most feared.  It was the same thing as the love section but about fear.  They show someone who is out of shape and her fear is ""of herself,"" then there is someone who had someone close to them die and says they are afraid of death.
 I would recommend this movie to anyone.  The only warning I would give is that some parts may be sad or involve death.  If you have a young child you might not want to watch this with them.  The movie also has the perfect ending.  You think one thing and it takes a complete turn.",1326240000,5,2268,4.524630541871921
4706119,1,B005HWAODY,Thank you movie for blindsiding me with an animal getting its head cut off. I'm not an animal activist of any sort but if you're going to have that in your movie at least warn me so I choose not to watch. Viewer beware.,1325030400,6,219,4.0
4706120,1,B005HWAODY,"Had to watch this movie on a long international flight (no other choices, thanks United Airlines).  Ordinary people are just not interesting. Yes, we are all the same and we are different (culture), but most people (including myself) are just ordinary, and that is not interesting to me.",1324512000,3,287,4.979166666666667
4706121,5,B005HWAODY,to me youtube had an awesome idea and the result is totally perfect. I think this movie it's really emotional too.,1324425600,2,114,4.476190476190476
4706122,3,B005HWAODY,"I just finished watching this on DVD. I generally like these types of films, but I didn't really connect with any of the people featured. Some scenes were pretty mundane - just day-to-day, nothing-special kinds of things. This DVD doesn't compare to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baraka/dp/B00005M91K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baraka</a>, especially when Life in a Day movie is viewable for free online or available from your local library (I rented this DVD from a library).",1323648000,3,521,6.457142857142857
4706123,5,B005HWAODY,"Very interesting and captivating documentary! I love the concept of the viewer participating in the lives of people from all over the world, the good, the bad, and the ugly. I feel that this is a movie that everyone should watch as it really shows how we are all so alike in our desires and wishes for life, love, and happiness. There are some disturbing parts of the video, especially for those who may be vegetarians or experience difficulty seeing animals slaughtered. I found those scenes disturbing, although they are but a very short segment of the film. I experienced so many emotions while watching this film, happiness, joy, appreciation, sadness, loss, love.....human life. The very last scene is powerful and sums up the film well. This would be a great gift as it is a film that you will want to share with family and friends. Enjoy!",1323129600,2,845,4.716216216216216
4706124,3,B005HWAODY,"If drama is life with the boring parts left out, then the one weakness of this film, is that it didn't quite remove all the boring parts.  Thus it gets off to a slow start, with clips of Westerners waking up, peeing, shaving, etc. This movie has relevance in a time capsule kind of way - you know, those containers you bury in the ground with stuff that shows what life was like in this century for future generations to dig up.  But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that it does not make for a compelling movie experience.  It is a tremendous feat in terms of editing the 4500 hundred hours of film down to a couple hours. It was bound to be a disjointed experience.  There are segments I found interesting - like the shoe shine kid, the single Japanese father who lights an incense for his dead wife every morning, the cow getting slaughtered.  I suspect there was an overabundance of footage from wealthier countries that had greater access to video cameras and computers. Having said that, there is a kernel of a great idea here.  An enterprising filmmaker could take the best parts of this movie and turn it into something great.",1322006400,3,1141,4.40952380952381

Excellent job!

4706128,5,B005HWAODY,"The editors chose such sweet and interesting video entries. The project was very cleverly put together--all the early-morning clips, followed by the wake-up clips, then breakfast clips, etc.--as if we were moving through one day (which we actually are!!).  The soundtrack is perfect--not distracting, but enhancing the mood.  The closing clip is so perfect one might wonder if it was scripted, but I know it was not.  You will smile while watching the video, and your heart will be warmed by the experience. What a wonderful world we live in, peopled by individuals just like us--we all sleep and eat and laugh and cry and worry and rejoice. I applaud the conceptualizers of this project!!",1320883200,24,689,4.973913043478261

8473746,5,B005HWAODY,"Very cool for a sociology class. I showed this to my class and then they all recorded the mundane day to day of their life. I provided them a rubric of different things the needed to document (morning routine, how they got to school, parts of their classes, after school activities, dinners) and then several of my more tech loving students would stay after with me to create a seamless video we then primered after school. They really enjoyed it!",1495238400,,447,4.6

Otherwise, knowing now that people all over the planet have to get up, urinate, dress, eat breakfast, go to work, is not an exciting discovery.  Let them do their own stories about 24 hours?  Some glints of intelligence, but mostly boring stuff.  This probably looked more interesting on paper.",1492387200,,407,4.757142857142857

8473749,4,B005HWAODY,Was interesting to get a glimpse into other people's lives and cultures. Warning: there is a scene involving harm to animals. It sneaks up on you...so be ready if you want to turn away. I wish they had expanded a bit on the guy who's been traveling for a while on his bicycle and the lady in the very beginning who mentioned the veil between our dimension and the spiritual dimension being the thinnest from 1-3 am or so. Some of the clips were not very revealing and I think a second edition could be neat that focused more on non-mundane topics or stories. Overall - worth watching and different from the norm - so I liked it.,1488758400,,628,4.330508474576271

8473752,5,B005HWAODY,"As someone who has traveled to over 13 different countries. This documentary was simply mesmerizing. The format was first of it's kind - user submitted mini documentaries combined into a narrative about the beauty of the human experience. I've watched over 1200 films, and this ranks among one of the best films I've ever seen (Along with American Beauty, Fight Club, Babel, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Inception, Interstellar). Even though this is available on Netflix, I'm going to buy this DVD and support the filmmakers.",1461801600,,527,5.211764705882353
