2920507,2,B00005TNFH,"It's another cold snowy winter day here so I once again took advantage of our Amazon Prime subscription and picked a flick.  This time I watched a film from 1969 called 'zeta one' (aka 'The Love Factor'). It's a British made secret agent film...sort of... maybe it's more a sex-ploitation film.  I can best describe it as a cross between the over the top spy films like 'Our Man Flint' and the recent Austin Powers films.  Also a touch of James Bond. There is a 'Barbarella' sci fi element to it too.  There's a race of alien  women with advanced technology who want us for mating purposes or something.  I'm not really sure. Like so many other B-movie female aliens they only seem to have women in their society.  Women who like to dress as male fantasies. Even their warrior women dress in pasties and G strings.  Evidently it's their favorite combat gear no matter how impractical and uncomfortable it must be. Yes, this is one of those movies.  It's loaded with 60s era nudity, mini skirts, boots and even a psychedelic trip or two.  It reminds me of the Austin Powers movies because it seems more an exaggerated spoof of the 60s then what it really is, a real 60s film. I lived through that time as a young teen so I know a little. It even had 'Laugh-in Style' girls dancing topless in body paint.  It's more 60s then I ever remember the 60s as being, it you can understand that. It's like what people now seem to imagine those days to be who weren't there.

Anyway, it's a funny film if you're in the right frame of mind.  There is one agent who looks like a British version of Barney Fife in round glasses.  Their version of M here is more into 'S & M'.  Yes, it's a strangely entertaining flick that bad movie fans should enjoy.  I'd give it a 2 1/2 out of 5 rating. I'll  have to give it 2 since I can't give half a star.",1363564800,,1830,4.288629737609329
2920508,3,B00005TNFH,"[ZETA ONE (AKA THE LOVE FACTOR) - 1969 - directed by Michael Cort - Widescreen] An early (and somewhat embarrassing) example of late 60's British sexploitation comedies, 'Zeta One' (originally titled 'The Love Factor') serves up a decent portion of softcore nudity, trippy psychedelic scenery, some unintentionally hysterical dialogue, some uncomfortable attempts at real comedy and, unfortunately, very little else. Except for a few beloved Hammer film Euro-lovelies like Valerie Leon, Dawn Addams, Anna Gael, Carole Hawkins and Yutte Stensgaard. And therein lies its worth.

'Zeta One' was based on a short lived European photo-magazine that obsessed (rightfully so) on beautiful models scantily clad in futuristic clothing. At its liveliest, the film contains recreations of kinky photo-shoot favorites like catfights and fetish-fashioned femmes in torture chamber tableau, as well as colorful scenes of 'alien' women discreetly disguised in identical black wigs and thigh-high Carnaby Street fashions. Sounds fantastic, right? I thought so too, having a genetic weakness for 60's fashions and the bountiful babes who wore them. So shoot me, I was wrong. The original Salvation DVD release gave this as a synopsis - ""A race of topless, large-breasted women from the planet Angvia, in another dimension, come to earth to kidnap women to repopulate their planet"". Huh? And how might they procreate, if you don't mind my asking? And would you mind terribly if I watched? See, now there's your problem - when you screen flicks like this, these details shouldn't matter, 'cause most men stopped reading right after the ""race of large-breasted women"" part, and that's how it should be.

The film's first quarter of an hour is a mercilessly motionless card game between Robin Hordon (the wooden male lead of 'When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth'), playing a poor man's James Bond, and office secretary Yutte Stensgaard as they drink, deliver pages of inconsequential dialogue and make furtive eyes at one other. Despite containing the film's first show of flesh, as they're playing strip-poker, this is pedantic padding at its most painful and just goes on forever. Eventually Hordon narrates flashbacks of some ""very extraordinary business"" concerning the Angvians, an interstellar race of women who kidnap lovely girls then brainwash them with kaleidoscopic optical effects. One such abductee gets hustled into a car by Angvian women in broad daylight then treated to a guided tour of their futuristic lair, which resembles the set of a children's TV program. Angvian headquarters includes such acid-induced deliriums as the 'Contemplation Room', the 'Self-Revelation Room' and let's not forget the unflappable 'Static Time Area' (as if we could). Where's 'Star Trek' era William Shatner when you need him most?  'Still with me? Frankly, I'm shocked...

The cinematic 'climax' serves as the film's inglorious highlight with stunning starlets as alien women running naked around the British countryside freezing their backsides off while pretending to fire invisible rays from their hands, and trying (in one instance failing) not to break out laughing. Whilst Eurovixen Brigitte Skay managed to drum up a fair amount of publicity for the film - photos of her in a revealing space-age bikini earned 'Zeta One' the cover of both Continental Film Review and Cinema X magazine - it wasn't until the 1995 video re-release that the film really found an audience, having since gone on to achieve a degree of novelty status due to many of its female cast members (nearly) finding success in Hammer horror and 'Carry On' comedy roles. Not that many of these actresses have fond memories of the production, mind you. Yutte Stensgaard claimed she felt exploited by her then father-in-law/manager who in a surreptitious turn didn't tell her about her nude scenes until she arrived on set, while the late Imogen Hassall was known to joke that a higher force must have been guiding her the day she turned down the role of an Angvian angel. Valerie Leon's sole memory of the production was that one-movie director and screenwriter Michael Cort being a somewhat strange bloke. Then again, if you've seen this film, you've probably guessed that already.

It's as simple as this - if you've got a penchant for silly 60's sexploitation films with knock-out babes running rampant topless in pendulum-swinging retro fashions, you'll enjoy it (once). Everybody else needs to avoid this one entirely, or you'll think you got stuck in the 'Static Time Area' indefinitely.",1363132800,52,4540,5.265193370165746
2920509,1,B00005TNFH,"I paid special attention to the end credits of this film, fully expecting to see a formal apology by everyone associated with the making of this indescribably bad film.  It is bad enough that this film was actually made, but now a company called Salvation has made this one of the first two releases of its Jezebel lineup of DVDs.  Don't let the presence of scantily clad and topless women fool you - Zeta One is an abysmal film.  I don't know who the looker on the box cover is - no one this attractive can be found in the film.  This 1969 British film is supposedly kitschy, whatever that really means; from what I can tell, it means embarrassingly ridiculous.
If you read the summary of the film, you will be wondering if you were sent the wrong movie as you watch the opening third of the movie.  This may be the most boring twenty-five minutes ever caught on film; even the big strip poker scene is mind-numbingly tedious.  Worst of all, we have to spend so much time with the film's main character James Word.  I would not even insult James Bond by calling James Word a poor spoof of the man.  Word is a spy of some sort who spends most of his time in bed.  This is made possible by strange women who magically appear in his apartment from out of the blue.  Girl number one is his boss' secretary, which allows her to see through Worth's ""brilliant"" fake moustache disguise; she pumps him for information about his latest mission, but he has other things on his mind.  Did I mention the fact that Worth is a pitiful, rather slimy specimen of manhood?  Anyway, Worth eventually opens up and tells girl number one this incredible story about a race of superwomen and the master criminal who tried to conquer them.
Yes, a Major Bourdon and his bespectacled dweeb of an assistant Mr. Swyne have learned of the existence of a race of superwomen who live - well, no one really knows where they live; we do know they kidnap selected Earth women in order to brainwash them and make them a part of their female-only society.  Major Bourdon is determined to get to the bottom of this for some reason that is never explained.  Luckily for him, the Zeta women (Zeta is the name of their leader; I could never understand the name they were given in the film) all dress in identical mini-dresses and go-go boots, making it easy to follow them.  (The mini-dresses and go-go boots are pretty much all this film has going for it.)  Swyne learns that a certain stripper (actually, none other than the ""Queen of the G-strings"") is to be the next kidnapped girl, and Bourdon puts his plan in motion of discovering how (and where) to conquer these alien women.  It all goes downhill from here.  I won't describe the silly information we learn about the mysterious Amazon-like women's society or Word's proclivity for bedding every strange woman that appears from out of nowhere in his bedroom.  Word does finally drag himself out of bed toward the end of the film, but he soon returns to the only place he seems to care about.  Don't worry too much about the alien women; they have a Plan 69 for anything, it seems.  You won't believe the weapon these girls use on silly human men, but you will see the absolutely predictable ending coming from a mile away.
Truly, Zeta One (aka Alien Women) is one of the most ridiculous films I have ever seen.  You can have a lot of fun with this film if you make a big party out of it and settle in with a bunch of friends to watch what is the ultimate embodiment of cinematic silliness; apparently, this film exists only for the purpose of being laughed at.  Keep a special eye out for the big and absolutely ridiculous ""elevator"" scene.",1073001600,7,3660,4.4624624624624625
2920510,3,B00005TNFH,"Secret Agent James Word (I guess his word is his bond) has just returned from a mission.  He is met by his superior's assistant (his superior is UU (Double-U like an upside down M)).  She plays coy and sexy but really just wants the details of his mission.  During breaks in apparent intimacy he recounts his tale.
He has been investigating a Major Bourdin who has been have a series of run ins with a mysterious force of women.  They are led by Zeta and have the ability to teleport.  It is unknown if they are from space, the future or another dimension, but they have set up a colony of women.  They add to the colony through kidnaping and brainwashing.
The film appears to have made no attempt at being erotic (check out the strip poker scene as an example) and the plotting is wooden (although some of the actual acting is quite good).
In the end we learn what the secretary is really up to and the final fate of James. I have to say that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would based on the other reviews.",1064275200,13,1012,4.244791666666667

I knew I was in for a letdown when I realized it was a Brit production. English comedians seem to flocculate into small and widely spaced globules of very funny. And then there's everybody else. In addition to being a humor vacuum and lacking sex appeal, the humor, such as it was, was very dated.",1485820800,,606,4.232758620689655

Stylistically, M Cort's 1Grade Z Sci-F- cum spy thriller  is a mashup of  everything from Barbarella, the Bond flicks, The Silencers, Mars Needs Women, Help!, And God Created Woman, Diabolik, Modesty Blaise...there isn't an original though in this cat's head!

Neverthless, out of sheer primitivism, some of his shots achieve the transcendent grace of La Nouvelle Vague, in the use of color, camera angle and off-kilter composition.

Highly recommended, but don't look for a plot or any acting per se.

The screen version is nothing compared to the real deal.  No perfume for one thing.  I watched for more than twenty minutes as the hero and (? heroine, villainess, whatever) played a game of Stop Motion Strip Poker.  Trust me, the writers probably wrote and edited the dialogue faster than these two actors could deliver it.  It's said that some spiders can go a month between meals.  That's the kind of patience one needs with this film.  ""Zeta One"" is actually a kind of time machine; it can stretch twenty minutes of viewing into an eon.  On the other hand, it does give you all the necessary ingredients to stage your own ""MST 3000"".  Collect a few friends and a keg of whatever stuns your inhibitions and have at it.

I am not joking or using a metaphor for something else.  The first 20 minutes is pillow talk between a knockoff James Bond character and a gorgeous blonde in bed together.  It sounds great, but it doesn't quite work because it doesn't follow through with much action.

It's a cheeky little exploit film, with lots of humor however, I expected to see more of what was illustrated on the poster... a space adventure.  It all takes place on Earth.

The special effects for this low budget were creative and the costumes were very good taking influences from the ancient Egyptians but again not as space-aged as the girl on the poster.  I feel it was a little misleading and that was why I rated it so low.

The negligee-thin storyline is just a flimsy frame for the obligatory naughtiness. When Zeta (Dawn Addams) finally makes her appearance, things pick up slightly. She and her fellow alien babes go around kidnapping beautiful Earth women to add to their colony. Yep, this is one of those movies that Uncle Joe used to sneak off to watch in some run-down theatre! Of course, in the age of the internet, ZETA ONE is far from shocking. However, it is fun in its own quaint little way.

So funny to see a movie released in 1970 in England and what they considered futuristic. I must say that the great sci fy authors like heinlein Clarke and Asimov would probably be appalled at this weak attempt at science fiction.

I am over 15 minutes in and am rewarded with a slow game of strip poker and cheesy seventies music. If it was rated in America wonder if it would be NC-17 or higher up or given an r rating.

I really am not sure of what to make of this. I guess it is just bad. She won and wanted to talk and he says in bed. Corny dialogue and even after the deed they have the shared cliche smoke. Also all of the tripping music and colors. Great if you like that I guess.
