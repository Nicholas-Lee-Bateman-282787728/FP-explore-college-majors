8423437,4,B004CRR9FQ,"I like the variety,  especially the hip exercises.  The one set of exercises,  lower body burn with Tanja Djelevic,
I already have on her Total Body Cardio.  I am assuming the downloadable ab workout from her is also the one
on TBC,  so I am not bothering with that.",1431216000,,266,4.346938775510204
8423438,5,B004CRR9FQ,Rodney Yee's sequence for hip openers is the best at easing hip pain. I seriously think most people would not need replacement surgery if they would commit to yoga like this.,1388793600,,174,4.645161290322581
8423439,4,B004CRR9FQ,"This DVD has 5 short workouts (around 30 min) of various types of Yoga and cardio. I had recently hurt one side of my lower back (doing dead lifts with too much weight) and the main reason I bought this DVD was because of the Rodney Yee Hip Opener segment. I enjoyed doing it and it got me even more interested in Rodney's Yoga DVDs. I also was pleasantly surprised with the other chapters and different instructors and really liked them with the exception of Suzanne Deason. I find her incredibly boring and non-motivating and her Yoga workout does nothing for me. However, the rest of the DVD is great and would highly recommend it.",1347235200,7,634,4.521739130434782
8423440,3,B004CRR9FQ,"This DVD contains 5 complete workouts.  It is a repackaging of Gaiam's previous releases.  The workout titles are Yoga Sculpt with Suzanne Deason, Pilates Lift and Firm with Jillian Hessle, Lower Body Burn with Tanja Djelevic, Cardio Kickbox with Cameron Shayne, and Hip Openers with Rodney Yee. There is a bonus downloadable AB workout from Gaiam's website.  You can play all (which would be a reeeaallllyyy long workout) or any combintation of the 5.  They are all aprox 30 minutes, except yoga sculpt is 20 and downloadable abs is 10.

Suzanne Deason's section was previously released as part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Conditioning-for-Weight-Loss/dp/B00004TKIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Conditioning for Weight Loss</a>.  I have checked it out from the library, and glad to have my own copy.  You do a traditional yoga practice (downward dog, forward fold, plank, chair, etc.) that hits the entire body.  It has a couple of advanced moves like moon pose, but I would recommend to both beginners and more advanced.  I give it 5 stars.

I've never done any workouts with Jillian Hessle as the instructor.  After doing some research on Amazon, I suspect it may be from Gaiam's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-for-Beginners/dp/B00007D00N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates for Beginners</a>&nbsp;because Jillian Hessle is wearing the same outfit in the picture, and I can see some of the same beautiful scenery in the background.  If anyone knows, please leave a comment.  The instructor does the intermediate/advanced levels, and she has a back up exerciser that does beginner modifications.  the routine is for days focused on the lower body because it's mostly legs, hips, and glutes with a little bit of abs/back. They probably focused on the lower body to fit the ""trouble zone"" part of the title.  She has some moves I've seen before (the series of leg lifts), but doesn't do anything like the 100 or serious ab work.  I liked the hip openers.  It was an okay routine and had some different moves than I usually see in pilates DVDs, so I give it 3 stars.

The crazy thing is that Lower Body Burn with Tanja Djelevic is a repackaging of a repackaging!  It was just released with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Zen-Body-Toners/dp/B003ZZ7TLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Zen Body Toners</a>.  Plus, even though it is called ""Lower Body Burn,"" it really is a full body workout.  You do lower body, upper body, balance, and compound moves.  The instructor even says ""for the upper body....""  It contains some traditional moves like squats, side lunges, and push ups, but she always adds something to it so the whole body is involved.  This burns more calories.  It has both cardio and mat work.  She uses imaginary weights at some points, so you could add weights to make it more challenging.  She does a good job cuing.  I really enjoyed it.  I give the routine 5 stars.

I'm thinking the title of the previous section may have made a mistake on the packaging because the next section says Cardio Kickboxing with Cameron Shayne on the box, but it is a yoga workout that focuses on the lower body.  It also is a repackaging of a repackaging!  It is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Zen-Tummy-Toners/dp/B002AL2U00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Zen Tummy Toners</a>.  Luckily, for me I checked that one out from the library instead of buying.  The instructor leads a class of exercisers and uses them to show form instead of doing the yoga himself.  It was okay.  I give the routine 2.5 stars.

The Hip Openers with Rodney Yee is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodney-Yee-s-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B001F76OKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners</a>.  Some example moves are cobler's pose, wide angle seated pose, half boat pose, staff pose, pigeon pose.  At some points you move rapidly through the poses to create heat and make it easier to open hips and at other times you hold the poses.  I felt a difference afterwards.  Plus Rodney Yee can do no wrong in my eyes!  I recommend for all levels even past beginners.  5 stars.

Downloadable abs is standing and floor routine with Tanja Djelevic and beautiful mountain scenery.  4 Stars.

I gave three stars hoping people would be warned about the repackaging, but really the value depends on what you are looking for and/or if you already have the previous DVDs.  I challenge the title of ""Trouble Zone Solutions."" However, I think the DVD does give you a little of everything (cardio, pilates, yoga, and even weights if you want to add them), so that someone on a budget that wanted to have a well rounded week of exercise would benefit from the DVD.",1299801600,27,4887,5.497986577181208
