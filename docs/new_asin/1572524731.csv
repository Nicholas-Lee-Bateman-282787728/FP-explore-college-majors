189693,4,1572524731,"In this documentary, first an academic or musician talks about the history of a Hawaiian musical style.  Then someone demonstrates it.  The focus in on music, but there is some hula here.  I love the way that this way constructionist:  they talk about pre-Cook music as well as the non-American but still Western influence on modern Hawaiian forms.  This film showed male and female; young and old; thin and fat.  To be honest, I dozed off a few time watching this, but that's because the music is so soothing.  This film totally makes me want to visit the Pacific Islands and learn the Hawaiian language.  I think all those interested in indigenous cultures and ethnomusicology should see this piece.",1079222400,18,701,4.831932773109243

7797757,3,1572524731,"Hawaiian Rainbow takes us through Hawaiian music and instruments from the very beginning up to the present craze of ukelele and slack key. It was a good overview, but the quality of the movie was dated. I guess I'm too used to HD quality. I particularly enjoyed the singing syles and the cultural background of each phase of Hawaiian music.",1389225600,,340,4.683333333333334
7797758,5,1572524731,"Being a lover of Hawaiian music, and especially traditional Slack Key and  Ukulele, I enjoyed seeing and hearing the story how the guitar and ukulele came to Hawaii, and how the Hawaiians made these instruments their own and developed their own particular styles of playing them. There is a lot of beautiful music and insightful story telling in this DVD. It is a welcome addition to my library.",1346544000,,395,4.8088235294117645

7797761,4,1572524731,"This film is a little dated now. It was made in 1988. But the ambition of the film is to document every aspect of Hawaiian music and that's a tall order. You will see a taste of hula, slack key, falsetto and steel guitar. You also get to see George Kanahele, the Hawaiian music scholar who has passed away. The highlights are falsetto by the Ho'opi'i Brothers and Sam Bernard, slack key by Ray Kane, a song by Genoa Keawe and protest songs by Mike Kahikina.

The downside is that the film is full of long sound bites trying to explain the the complexity and background of the music. Every Hawaiian music lover should see it, but have some coffee handy.",1111622400,6,652,4.3884297520661155
