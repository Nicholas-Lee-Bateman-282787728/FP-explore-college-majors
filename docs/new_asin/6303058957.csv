546611,5,6303058957,One should not dismiss this Batman due to the fact that it is an animated feature. This one is for adults as well as children. As a matter of fact this one captures the essence of the Dark Knight better than any of the  live-action features.,922060800,,241,4.239130434782608
546612,5,6303058957,"For all of you who are dissapointed in the Batman movies that have been released, you are not alone.  This movie does not focus on who plays Batman, who does the songs, and who plays his girlfriend.  This story is  about Bruce Wayne, his first romance and his decision about what is more  important, stopping crime or being in love.  It involves flashbacks,  stories told from character's points of view, and switches back to modern  day.  A new character shows up calling itself ""The Phantasm"" and  is a vigalante, killing mob bosses.  After one such episode witnesses  report that they think Batman is the one to blame.  Can Batman clear his  name?  I absolutely loved this movie, fantastic animation, great voice  acting (particularly Mark Hamel as The Joker), and an intriging story.",914457600,2,787,4.856060606060606

546939,5,6303058957,This is my favorite Batman film. The characters are spot on. SO happy this is on Blu-Ray with a great transfer. Highly recommended.,1522886400,,131,4.739130434782608
546940,5,6303058957,"One of the greatest Batman films ever made. This is a story that is great for those who are not familiar with the character, but even better for long time die-hard fans. It has every element a Batman film should have: A dark noir tone, an engaging mystery, a tragic and gothic romance, and a more than satisfying villain. All the voice acting is spot on, especially the iconic work of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (but I believe that goes without saying). As for the quality, I'd say this is a pretty great Blu-ray conversion. The colors really pop, there is an immense amount of detail, and it still retains that beautiful grain that really makes you feel like you are watching a classic noir film. I do wish that there was an option to purchase the film with a digital download code, but that is a small nitpick in this otherwise glowing review. The product came in great condition and I can't recommend you buy it enough.",1522454400,,924,4.4733727810650885
546941,5,6303058957,"They did a great job on it and like all older things forced or redone into HD that were originally made in SD, you will notice certain things about the video easier than you would in the SD version on an older TV set. They are not in abundance or bad at all, but you can't expect 100% digital perfection for an aged hand drawn animated release. Noise/Grain seem to kept in check with no strong DNR visible so details are not smudged out with DNR. I hate when that gets done to releases but its nice in this release. You may also notice certain scenes or frames are a bit softer than the rest which are crisp and sharp. This has always been there even in the DVD release, it's just much easier to notice in the sharper/cleaner HD conversion they did. This is not an issue that was introduced in the Blu-Ray release.

Compared to the DVD, this looks much better. I am sure they could do somewhat better with more work and time put into it, but its not at all badly done and quite the improvement over the DVD. I'm not bothered at all by lack of special features like most people seem to be. I bought this for the movie itself! Special features are just bonuses I enjoy on occasion. My favorite feature out of everything and I wish I could see on more things is the fact that they give you both the Widescreen and the Fullscreen version of the movie. Not everyone likes to watch cropped off video that was cut off to force something into widescreen when it was not originally animated to be that way. By the same token, not everyone can stand the black bars on the sides because their OCD or being used to widescreen nowadays won't allow it. So getting both choices is AWESOME!!

If you want the movie and you want it looking great that is also an improvement over the DVD release, this is a great purchase. If you only care about special features and 100% digital perfection, good luck waiting the rest of your life for it and miss out on a nice movie release due to OCD.",1522108800,,1969,4.2761394101876675
546942,2,6303058957,"I'm writing a quick review for this, because it was something I had very much looked forward to. If you haven't seen the movie this is a great addition to the Bruce timm Batman animated series.
Unfortunately the Blu-Ray master is only true HD for about half of the film- the shots jump from DVD quality to Blu-Ray quality in between cuts. It's really weird, I haven't seen something like this before and it makes me wonder if when they were capturing it from the whatever original film master the projection when in-and-out of focus between shots, and someone wasn't keeping a careful enough eye on that.
So if you were really looking forward to having a true HD Blu-Ray master of Bruce Timm's classic this falls short. Again not a bad movie, just a sloppy job transferring it to Blu-Ray.",1521244800,,788,4.595744680851064

The story is thrilling and provides a different look into the rise of Batman and the reveal of a new villain, the Phantasm. If you already have Amazon Prime, you can watch Batman: The Animated Series on Prime Video to get a sense of the art style and voice acting, which are both top notch. For many, like myself, Kevin Conroy is the voice of Batman and Mark Hamill's Joker is on the best and stands shoulder to shoulder with Heath Ledger's version.",1515110400,,596,4.527777777777778

547068,5,6303058957,"I'll just say, for now, that Channel Awesome--namely Nostalgia Critic's review--brought me to this one. That, and my respect for the cinematic dread and substance-driven justice to the genuine comic article. Not to mention Batman, the 1989 film. To think, I heard of this one over twenty years ago on the FREE WILLY vhs tape. Regarding the film itself, a bit of reiteration of the 1989 live-action film, and Batman Returns (1993), but doable. From art-deco design to the psychological aspect of the Caped Crusader and his principal nemesis, the Joker, this animated feature shows the hero not just moving in front of his base city; it shows him moving with the city, and vice versa. In short, the hero's atmosphere is not all gorgeous neither is the hero's life. Thus, why he goes about trying to change it. And then there's Batman's way versus the Phantasm's way; dare to compare. If your looking for animated film truly worthy of the accolades bragged about by today's mediocre trailers and TV spots, start with BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM. Or at least include as a potential candidate.",1514246400,,1089,4.860215053763441
547069,5,6303058957,"People who argue over which actor has turned in the best performance as Batman often overlook Kevin Conroy, who was the voice of Batman for a generation of Nineties kids who have never been satisfied with any cinematic Batman before or since.  And people who argue whether Nicholson or Ledger was the best Joker . . . have probably never seen this movie.  I am spoiling the fact that The Joker is in it, but I don't care.  Mark Hamill's portrayal of the Joker, even as a voice actor, is simply fantastic and at least as good as Jack Nicholson's.  Dana Delaney (who played Lois Lane in the contemporary Superman cartoon) is terrific as the female lead, and Abe Vigoda and Stacy Keach deliver very good performances that sound more like an A-list actor doing a Disney villain than someone ""phoning it in.""  Top-notch voice acting is one thing the Bruce Timm cartoons are known for, and this movie is no exception.

Writer Paul Dini tells the origin story of Batman in a novel way by NOT focusing on the way Bruce Wayne lost his parents, but rather how it changed him as a person and why he actually decided to do something about it.  Like Batman Begins, the story is non-linear.  There is a main storyline that follows a very seasoned, resolute Batman at the top of his game, solving a murder mystery for which he is the main suspect while staying one step ahead of the police and a corrupt city official; and then there is an origin story, told in flashbacks, that explores the very early days of Bruce Wayne's crime-fighting career as an angsty, conflicted young man.  The stories converge in the final act, when ""Present Bruce"" uncovers something about his past and ""Past Bruce"" finally creates the persona of Batman.  In other words, it's a story about the ""World's Greatest Detective,"" and it finds that winning formula of action and intrigue that a lot of live-action portrayals have gotten wrong.

This is a cartoon for kids, but it tells a very grown-up story with some dark themes about betrayal, lost love, and obsession.  You get a sense of just how tragic and self-destructive Bruce Wayne's decision to become Batman really was, and there several cold blooded murders that add weight to the story and make the villains feel genuinely evil.  In this reviewer's opinion, this really is the best Batman STORY ever done in a movie, as well as the best incarnation of Batman.  This is not some hasty direct-to-video release, either.  The animation was done in-house at Warner Bros. and is every bit as good as the highly-acclaimed cartoon it was based on, with plenty of action and adventure and a slick Film Noir atmosphere.  Shirley Walker's orchestral score is also excellent and worthy of being compared to Danny Elfman's score for the '89 Tim Burton movie.

If you liked Batman Begins, but haven't seen this movie, you are missing out.  If you're a Batman fan, you'll love it and watch it over and over.  Highly recommended.",1511308800,,2934,4.684210526315789

Warning, I did watch the series in the 90's so I might be biased in the favoritism of this art direction...you know...the direction of quality. It's a very high quality film.

547307,4,6303058957,"I can remember seeing this film in theaters with my Dad. It had a huge impact on me as a Batman fan and as a person. It is one of the many films that taught me something important about life. Namely, the poisonous nature of vengeance. It is still one of my favorite Batman films of all time. It's just a shame that this new BluRay doesn't really do it justice.

Hear me out. The film itself is still fully intact and it's really worth having this film in the highest quality possible. It's just that this particular BluRay, at least the copy I have, has a glaring flaw that kind of weakens the experience. For some reason, in the copy I have, there are occasional shots that just seem to suddenly dip in quality. Sometimes shots will turn fuzzy and there are occasional strange movement artifacts that I don't remember ever seeing in this film before. It's almost like this BluRay was based upon a DVD or even Laserdisc transfer.

Now, I don't want to give the impression that this is a bad movie or that this BluRay is not worth adding to your collection, because it absolutely is, especially if you're a Batman fan. I just wish that they put a little more effort into the BluRay's creation. As it stands, it's pretty decent but has a few noticeable flaws that I think should not be there. Maybe later on we'll get a better version of it but, until then, this will do nicely.

547311,5,6303058957,"11 years after the Blu ray format was launched, Batman: The Animated Series FINALLY makes it debut in high-definition format with this release of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993), the first and only animated feature spin-off of the classic 1992-1995 Batman animated series.  This is arguably the best that series ever looked AND for many fans it IS the best Batman film produced to date.  It is certainly the finest animated/action/adventure theatrical spin-off of a MAJOR superhero, if not the most popular superhero in the world.
I'll continue this review with a few negative notes.  One, this Blu ray is VERY basic with a static menu (not a big deal, it means the disc loads faster!) and only the original theatrical trailer as an extra.  Yep, after 24 years, WB has not deigned it practical or desirable (yet!) to do any sort of extras for this film despite its cult status.  You think they would have gotten key production personnel to talk about the making of the film in a documentary or commentary track but it didn't happen.  Also, there WAS a mini-featurette tie-in about the making of this film produced for HBO that aired around the time of the original theatrical release back in 1993 but that wasn't on the disc, either!
My second pet peeve is aimed at the film itself.  It is NOT an original story.  This is an uncredited adaptation of a 4-part storyline, ""Batman: Year Two,"" that was published in Detective Comics in 1987!  Don't believe me, read the comic yourself and you'll see -- the major plotline of a grim-reaper antagonist, lost love, etc -- it's all there.  They made some changes for the feature film but it is still basically ""Batman: Year Two"" in the main.  This has never been acknowledged even though more recent animated films and TV series are doing a better job of crediting the original storyline writers and character creators.
Now, back to the disc...
The video quality is excellent, by far the best this film has looked on home video.  The original film grain is evident but not overdone.  It gives the film a nice, organic look that is lacking in digitally produced animation made for direct-to-video (which ironically was the original intent for the film until a studio executive saw the storyboards, liked them, and ordered the film be retooled for theatrical release).  It looks like a THEATRICAL movie, not a sterile home video.
The audio quality is serviceable but it's not extraordinary.  I think it's basic stereo, not 5.1...  Would have been nice to hear another language track had one been made for this film.  My guess is that there are probably vocal audio tracks recorded in other languages considering the animated Batman TV series was redubbed in French, Spanish, and Japanese for sure!
One of the best qualities of this film aside from the visual aesthetics is the symphonic soundtrack which is among the best of any Batman film.  It's a rousing re-invention of the themes first heard in the 1989 Batman movie and reinvented and elaborated on in the later 1992-1995 Batman animated series.  This film has a beautiful score and even an excellent throw-away pop song played over the end credits.
The vocal performances in this film are excellent and never over the top.  This is not campy Batman but it's also not the dreary, bleak, depressing mess that so many recent Batman projects have devolved into, either.  (And it's WAY better than the recent Batman and Harley Quinn movie.)  That's a credit to both the actors and the voice director who I believe was Andrea Romano who just announced her retirement.  You'll hear not only Kevin Conroy and Dana Delany (in her first major animation voiceover prior to being cast as Lois Lane for Superman: The Animated Series) but also character actors Dick Miller, Abe Vigoda, and of course, Mark Hamill as The Joker.  Stacy Keach voices the title villain, the Phantasm, who has one of the major plot twists of the film and one of the big departures from the original comic mini-series this film was based on.

If Batman and Joker  don't sound like Conroy and Hamill in other productions, I am distracted ('that's not Joker') and disappointed. Bruce Timm is another name I look for. Watching the features of DC animated over the years I have learned what his philosophy is in bringing these characters to life, so his stamp of approval on a DC movie means I am going to enjoy the ride. The story was new to me since I don't read the original books, and unlike some other reviewers, I enjoyed it, especially the scenes with Batman and Joker. The origin of Joker is an interesting twist . He didn't always have a clown face, oddly enough.  Who knew? This one is definitely in my collection.",1502409600,,777,4.464788732394366

547632,4,6303058957,"I've seen this movie countless times, including in the theater when it was released and just recently again projected on film at an LA art house theater.

The blu-ray includes both the full-frame, 4:3 version which it was originally animated for, and the cropped & zoomed 16:9 widescreen version made for theaters.  Both look great, but the widescreen version looks a rougher.  I'm not sure how different the picture would be if you just zoomed the full-frame version.

When comparing it to the original DVD, the colors are definitely vibrant, but there's not much more detail in the picture to be had.  The audio clearly sounds better, but I can't tell if its just because the original DVD's transfer was done in 1999.  Because this film was originally made for a VHS release back in 1993, there's really not much that be done to take advantage of the high-def format.

Also, no extras whatsoever, just like the DVD.  If you don't own the DVD, I'd definitely recommend this version simply because its the best you can get, but if you do own the DVD, I wouldn't be in a rush to buy this.",1501891200,2,1087,4.595854922279793

547696,5,6303058957,"I think it's no secret among Batman fans that Mask of the Phantasm (and The Animated Series, in general) is one of the best yet also most under-appreciated films in the franchise. It's dark, serious, and stylish with a tight story told with great pacing. Even though it is often viewed as a ""kids movie,"" it is most definitely not. In fact, I wouldn't even call it a ""family film"" (at least no more than Batman from 1989).

If you're reading this, however, you probably know all that already, so let's get to this new Blu-ray release.

What you get here is a very basic set. The disc contains two versions of the film (more on that in just a second), the option to turn English subtitles on or off, and the theatrical trailer. That's it, no bells and whistles at all, not even a scene selection screen!

The two versions of the film are labeled in the Main Menu as the ""Theatrical presentation"" and the ""Television presentation."" The only difference between the two is that the Television presentation is in a 4:3 aspect ratio (the then normal ratio of a TV screen), while the Theatrical presentation zooms into the frame to fill a widescreen TV. It's sort of like a modern day version of those widescreen vs fullscreen DVDs you used to see, except in this case it's more like full screen vs tall screen.

I highly recommend watching the film in the Television presentation, as that is how it was originally animated and meant to be viewed. Unfortunately the Blu-ray only points this out if you choose the Television format; if you choose the Theatrical it just plays the movie without warning you that the image is cropped and missing the full picture.

As for the picture and audio quality, it's as good as I expected it to be. Remember that this is an animation from 1993 which wasn't even originally intended to be given a theatrical release, so the quality isn't going to be super sharp or clear. The soft look of the animation has always been the style of the show, and it is both respected here while also cleaned up enough to look great on a big modern HDTV, a definite improvement over the DVD version of the show that I have.

The audio is a 2.0 mix, which some might find disappointing instead of a 5.1. Yet again though, this isn't the fault of the Blu-ray, it's just how the source material is. Channels aside, the audio is crisp and clear and sounds great through my home theater sound system.

Over all, I highly recommend this Blu-ray release. It's the best that the film is ever going to look or sound, and definitely deserves a spot in any movie library, kid or adult alike.",1501027200,10,2592,4.502127659574468
547697,4,6303058957,"I am a tremendous fan of this series and was waiting forever for this. I pre-ordered it and just put it in the blu-ray player. It looks amazing. Beautiful colors, clean picture, sounds great. Best it ever looked. My wife even made a comment at how great it looked in passing. It is my understanding that the technical complications in creating this soaked up the budget and didn't allow for any special features. I don't buy that. Surely all those DC Collectible figures based off the series that are always flying off the shelves would warrant putting in a little more into this for fans. Below are some things that they should have done. I hope when the actual series gets done they go the extra mile. The popularity of Harley Quinn alone should validate that for DC/Warners.

1) Box Art - Make the fans feel like they are getting something new. I would have used the Bruce Timm art that was on the comic adaptation (photo included). Fans would have flipped for that. Bruce Timm has legions of fans these days and all the dc animated movies always say ""New from Bruce Timm"" etc. already...why not put some Bruce Timm art on it? It would be equivalent to a stamp of approval for a re-release. The box art on the actual series dvd is bad and off model. Fans pay attention to that stuff. Definitely redo that art when you blu-ray the full series.

2) Commentary - It was a bad move to not put commentary on this. It couldn't have cost that much to do. Please please please do full commentary on ALL the episodes on the series blu-ray (not just the few that already exist). You should mix it up too. Not just Timm and Radomski, but some tracks should be like oh I don't know... Mark Hamill and Arleen Sorkin!! or Martin Pasko and Joe Lansdale!!! Switch it up every episode. The rarer and unique the commentary the better.

3) Bonus - Behind the scenes featurettes, making of, concept art, etc. There is no lack of resources for this stuff so put it on the movie (and series). Again, put in the extra dough for this WB! This show built DC Animation as far as I'm concerned.

Again, the quality of the actual movie on the blu-ray is great. So four stars for a job well done, but brought it down a star for not going the extra mile. Hopefully a full series release will have more love put into it.",1500940800,7,2292,4.385882352941176
547698,3,6303058957,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of the film.

This is not a review of the film itself, which is magnificent. It's a review of the Blu-ray version. I just received it today, and I must say that I'm... conflicted.

Pros:
On one hand, we have deep blacks and reduced noise. There are certain scenes that are incredibly sharp and detailed, highlighting the dark city of Gotham and its frequently moody atmosphere.

The sounds are well done with an even mix across the board. Vocals are audible and come through in most scenes without having to play with the volume.

Cons:
I hate to say it, but the whole movie is borderline ruined by a frequently distracting problem. On certain scenes, the whole picture is just... blurry. What's more, this isn't a rare phenomenon, it's constantly coming back. There are times when you will be marveling at the details in 1080P and how gloriously sharp it is, then a couple of scenes later it's like you have a bad connection and are waiting for Netflix to catch up... except you aren't watching Netflix. It's incredibly distracting. I found myself pulled out of the movie every time it went blurry. I can deal with constant noise, or even a lack of sharpness, but to have it be so contrasting so frequently really hurts the whole experience. Fortunately the problem gets slightly less frequent towards the later half of the film, but it's still present.

Rundown:
I really like this movie and recommend it to you fully, but I have a hard time recommending this version of it. I put my DVD in and played it after watching the Blu-ray and yes, it had far more noise and artifacts. The blacks aren't as tight, and the overall picture is less sharp, but it's consistent. I don't mind the grain and the noise, it even gives it a certain noir flavor that lends to the atmosphere. This might be equally distracting for someone else though, so I leave it up to you to decide which you would prefer. The size of your TV and the sensitivity of your own eyes could have a drastic effect on these matters.

I am not calling out anyone for this, for all I know those scenes are incapable of being sharp because of their source materials and they did the best they could. However, I don't have to like the results that came of it. I will be putting the DVD in the next time I play this film, because I just can't deal with the bipolar nature of the picture on Blu-ray.",1500940800,20,2395,4.45662100456621

Finally we get this magnificent movie with a new 1080p high definition remaster in it's original theatrical aspect ratio 16x9 (1.78:1) and an open matte 4x3 (1.37:1) sadly we only get a 2.0 stereo dts hd master audio only in English. I'm a little bit disappointed that it's not 5.1 but at least it is a hd master audio mix. And it will only have subtitles in English. As far as the info from the distributor states their will only be the theatrical trailer in hd as the only special feature.

I have been waiting years for this and it will be released a few weeks after my birthday, so this is a special treat for me. I have already pre ordered my copy from Amazon.

The voice acting, particularly Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, is absolutely impeccable.

The artwork is cheap, the animation stingy, and the character development is absent.

548503,5,6303058957,"on Christmas day 1993 Warner Bros released this Film to much critical acclaim, the film was made in the spirit of the highly acclaimed and successful Batman:The Animated series which was released in 1992,by this time there had already been 2 live action
Batman films released by Warner Bros which were directed by Tim Burton.
In this Film a new masked vigilante called the Phantasm is going on a killing spree on crime bosses in Gotham city, the police and Batman are now out to stop this mysterious vigilante.
While this Film is a little on the short side, it makes good use of its time, there's non stop action, plus good and meaningful dialogue as well.
The Artwork in the Film is pretty much the same as the Animated series and yes it does look old  and more stiff than todays stuff, but character design I think was better here than later Batman animated shows,
The voice acting is great, its the same as the show with Mark Hamill (who played Luke Skywalker).
Having a new villain was also a high point in the film.

Spoiler filled retrospective
The Detective element in the film is well done, it represents what makes Batman who he is, it highlights his intelligence and remind us after his first appearance was in a Comic called Detective comics. In the film Batman wants to figure out who the Phantasm is,but has  a very difficult time,the Gotham city police have an even harder time, to the point where they think Batman is the Phantasm, I like the conflict that is caused by this plot device.
The Mystery of the Phantasm is done well here, the film doesn't  make it obvious its Andrea until the right time when Batman finds out the connection of the Phantasms victims.
The cemetery scenes in the film were really gripping, the scene when Bruce is talking to his parents grave and telling him that hes changed his mind about fighting crime in Gotham,i loved how lightning strikes at that moment, its almost like a sign of his parents disapproval. I also thought it was really strange that Batman comes with his full costume at one point to see talk to his Parents grave as if no one that could be in the Cemetery would notice him and figure his identity.
 I love how the film had us question Bruce choosing to be happy with Andrea versus becoming the Batman, it also is very sad to watch Bruce torn between his destiny as Gothams defender and love.
The film is one of many comics and movies that tells the origin of Batman, but it does so much different that it feels like a good version of the story that still holds up well, its just as good as Batman Begins, if not better.
The scene when Batman first put on a mask was great, I love the shocked look on Alfreds face when this happens.
Another high point in the film is the love story, Andrea is not your typical love interest, her fighting ability is good and she plays a huge overall role in the film and just how many films do have a love interest also be the main villain, it makes for on the best plot twists in cinema.
Batmans mission once again collides with the motives of a villain here, Andrea wants revenge, Batman wants justice.
overall this one of my favorite films,it still holds up great, although I wish there was a HD version available.",1459641600,,3215,4.451612903225806

548887,5,6303058957,"I grew up on Batman the Animated Series. It was amazing. Many would cite my recollection of that show (And others such as Spider-Man and X-Men the Animated Series) as being blinded by simple nostalgia, which is a fair, though overused, judgement. However, I have rewatched the entirety of the series a total of two times in the last five years, and I can say that rating my opinion of the show has far more to do with just nostalgia. The music, the gothic look of the setting, the animation, the storyline's of individual episodes, all were consistently good, which isn't something that can be said for many cartoon shows. And so it's really only fitting that Batman Mask of the Phantasm manage to carry on all the great traits from the series, while at the same time creating a larger stage to present them on. This film is epic in every way, and at the same time somewhat lowkey. The overall plot when all is said and done is really just a story of mystery, murder, and love, which when you compare it to the character that would later go on to fight right beside the likes of Superman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman to save the world time and again seems fairly average. That is part of the film's charm however. Because Batman doesn't need to be facing some world conquering aliens or visiting a hidden city of intelligent gorillas in order to be entertaining. This film goes back to the characters roots, citing the reason for his war against crime, while at the same time showing that he's not made of hard, unfeeling stone. This latter showing makes his decision to become Batman that much more tragic. The scene where he begs his parents, at their graves no less, to accept his choice to choose love over fighting crime, the revelation of the true identity of the man that murdered Andrea's father, the final confrontation at the former world of the future, all are excellently and poignantly done. I feel that it says a lot that nearly two decades after I first saw the film I am still able to sit on a couch and be thoroughly engrossed by it, as if I was still that same 8 year old boy watching his favorite super hero with his parents.",1441238400,26,2148,4.482142857142857

548984,4,6303058957,"The streets of a cinematic Gotham City will never look the same as they did back in 1993 (boy, were those the days of great superhero movies at the Cineplex, or what?) when the Radomski/Timm animation team and crew turned their skills towards a feature length episode of one of the Dark Knight's many adventures, and thereby illustrated for the world to see how a real animated picture was meant to be done. Between flashbacks of Bruce Wayne training for power to become the Dark Knight and present day scenes of his current troubles when an old flame of his returns to Gotham, ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" delves deeply into the emotions of Bruce Wayne and his complex psyche as he attempts to thwart a new menace in town and keep this new Phantom (whom everyone thinks is the Bat) from wiping out the city's mob kingpins (and the unraveling tale is a doozy, with both Batman and the Joker getting some bloody punches in at each other during the finale).
When I first watched the picture, I felt that it was a bit too slow moving, and (when I was younger) I thought that the plot was a little complex considering how clever and punchy that the animated series episodes were. ""Batman the Animated Series"" (which aired from September 5, 1992 until September 15, 1995--to me, a very dark day, since this is still my favorite television show ever) is the best animated television show of all time (and, to me, the best of all time period), encompassing quality storytelling, shaped characterizations, literary and popular cultural references (that would have been above the heads of youngins), tremendous action, quick pacing, exciting villains, grippingly dark animation, and a thrilling sense of style and sensitivity that never allowed the show to become depressing or too black (there were colorful villains from the DC Comics library that visually recalled the ridiculous television program of the 60's with Adam West without compromising the integrity and serious mental imbalances of the villains themselves with a layer of adult-minded seriousness of tone that never destroyed the playful sensibility of good cartooning; also, the show was one of the only ones--if not THE only one--to really understand how fantasy storytelling works, combining surreal moments with realistic looking backgrounds and real human emotions). Sadly, perhaps due to a bum marketing campaign at the time and a rather hasty decision by Warner Brothers to release the film at the eleventh hour, ""Mask of the Phantasm"" crapped out at the movie theater, with even fans of the show missing it (I know this because I missed it when it first came out, and I watched the TV program religiously). Because the film was not intended for a big screen release, it plays tremendously well upon a home screen (as does the fantastic series itself). Now, at least, we have a DVD in which Alan Burnett's stinging story (assisted by Michael Reaves, Martin Pasko, and Paul Dini), Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm's amazing directing, Shirley Walker's energizing score, and especially the irreplaceable voice talents of Kevin Conroy (he IS Batman as far as I'm concerned) and Stacy Keach (among others) can be preserved and studied for all time. ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" is a mature work, almost too mature in places, that will thrill every true fan of the Batman character and reveal insight into the short-lived but fertile window of creativity that this animation team opened at one special moment in time. The picture is romantic, fantastic, engrossing, and dramatic, all without compromising the great action sequences that made up the best of the animated series episodes.

In an age when blockbuster live-action superhero movies are hijacking the pleasures of reading paper comic books and the joy of watching Saturday morning animated cartoon shows (the recent Marvel ""Avengers"" movie franchise is what I'm pointing the finger at), it is always refreshing to go back to watch a movie in which both the DC Comics characters are respected and the animated style reminds one of what was so wonderful in the first place about loving these characters (I despise the Christopher Nolan revisions of Batman for the movies, and I am so sad that these animators were not given the chance to do more big screen work on Batman--add too much adult content and the concept is ruined; add too much kid-friendliness and we end up with ""The Batman"" animated show). The DVD has good picture and sound, but I have to prevent myself from giving it five stars due to a lack of extra content. Even the ""Animated Series"" DVDs have audio commentaries by the creators and several 'making of' features about the show's design and writing. I am very disappointed with the lack of extras on this one. However, for the most part, other reviewers are correct in saying that this is the way an animated movie should be made, and it's a far better movie to watch than any other Batman big screen offering (always a favorite of mine during the summer)...but I admit that I also love the two Burton movies since I grew up with those as well. But really, there is no beating this animated Batman for quality storytelling and excitement. Miss this one at your own cinematic risk.

BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM: The one woman Bruce Wayne ever loved returns, after disappearing for a decade. But their chance at happiness is complicated by his secret life as The Batman, which he sees as incompatible with ever having a normal, private home life. Meanwhile, The Batman has his share of problems as well: A mysterious figure is killing off criminals in Gotham Cityand the only connection seems to be the father of Bruces ex-love.

Discussion: This feature version of the Emmy Award-winning animated TV series works as well as any of the live-action Batman movies prior to Christopher Nolans reimagining of the character in 2005and better than most of them (Im looking at you, Joel Schumaker). The plot is intriguing, logical and unpredictable, and the gothic Gotham City looks like some nightmare offspring of 1930s Art Deco and 1940s and 50s film noir angles and shadows. Although the animation is limited in places, the artists often use this to their advantage: Sometimes all we really need to see to send a shiver up our spines is the silhouette of a peak-eared cape in the shadows.

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is always interesting to look at, the finale is striking, and the style perfectly matches the emotion. And thats the real unexpected bonus of this movie: emotion. Against all odds, its difficult not to be affected by this flick. Anyone whos ever lost a loved one, to death or dissolution, can relate to Waynethe dark knight of the soul, to coin a phrase. Not bad for a kiddie cartoon! (It will, however, be best appreciated by older kids.)",1423094400,,1827,4.703125

Story wise, it gives viewers an origin story to who Batman is, why he feels the need to have to dress up like a Bat, and even shows us a glimpse of the woman who broke his heart. Really reminds you that he doesnt want to be Batman, he wants a normal life but he cant. If you don't know anything about batman, you will be ok, and if you love batman its also great. Closest way of describing this movie is BATMAN BEGINS but in animated form, and thts pretty incredible considering this movie came out in the early 90s.

Presentation, all the artwork, city, automobiles is done in a way where it seems modern but retro at the same time, giving Gotham a timeless look, so you can see it now, ten years from now, or 30 years from now and it will not look out of date. Cars look retro, but they have cell phones, modern tech, etc..

Audio, some of tbe best orchestra music ive heard.

Over all, if your a batman fan you deserve to see this, if your a new comer, its a good intro to the batman mythos. Great movie, for all ages. But adults will enjoy it more.",1417305600,3,1320,4.18503937007874

549534,5,6303058957,"By far, this is my favorite Batman movie out of the 8 theatrical releases and the multiple straight-to-Disc films released by DC Animated Studios. Mask of the Phantasm is a murder mystery, Batman is investigating a string of deaths being committed against a high-profile Mafia network being perpetrated by a new masked vigilante in Gotham. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne finds himself once again in the company of a lover from many years in his past. Mask of the Phantasm serves as a prequel to Batman: The Animated Series, showing how a younger Bruce Wayne trained himself in Gotham and created the mantel of The Batman. The drama of a potentially reignited love and, the mystery of a violent new vigilante in Gotham are made even more complicated when signs point to The Joker being involved.

Kevin Conroy voices Batman in this film and while it was early in his long run as the character, Conroy still does an amazing job. Out of everyone who has acted as Batman, Conroy has always been my personal favorite. Joining him, in the role of The Joker, is Mark Hamill who also puts in an amazing job.

Mask of the Phantasm ties in to Batman the Animated Series but it is definitely a PG. I don't remember there being any bad language but I wouldn't be surprised if 'damn' or 'Hell' pop up at some points. People do die in this film but they're blood thirsty mobsters being killed. Finally there is a bit of onscreen blood for once, as a character has a tooth punched out. Don't let that discourage you from showing your grade-school aged kids this however, since the film as a whole is still excellent and proves that Batman is more than just a guy in silly armor with a stupid voice.",1407110400,3,1675,4.561461794019934

549538,5,6303058957,"Like the series this film spins off from, I absolutely love it!  My one negative comment is that the studio decided so late in the production process to release it to theaters rather than their original plan to make it as a television film...imagine the budget and the outcome that could have been if it had been planned for a theatrical release all along.  But this movie still came out absolutely great!  My favorite part was the chanting choir at the beginning and end of the film.  That music brought the television show's theme to new heights and gave the film that gothic feel that Batman practically has a paten on.  As for the cast, old and new, everyone was as amazing as in the show.  The Phantasm (never actually called that in the film itself but only in the credits) was an awesome addition to the Dark Knight's rogues gallery...I won't name voice actors so there are no spoilers.  I did initially question The Joker's late entry into the film...why have him at all?  It just seemed like a last-minute addition to bring a familiar villain to the screen.  But The Joker was ultimately worth having in the film...goes to show you what first impressions can be like.  The story about Bruce Wayne's past and the lost love is also done very well.  It's never corny and keeps the darkness that Batman:  The Animated Series is so well known for.  I've watched this film several times and I'll watch it thousands more times in my lifetime.  For a Batman fan, it's a must-have.  For someone wanting to see what Batman's all about, it's a good start.  For anyone who just wants to see a really good animated movie, I recommend this one.

549541,1,6303058957,"Several people online suggested that this was the best Batman movie, even better than the Dark Knight.

I'm not sure what they were thinking. Most of the positive reviews were from before the Christopher Nolan reboot, but Mask of the Phantasm doesn't hold a candle to Dark Knight. It's almost certainly better than the Batman and Robin movie, but that's saying very little.

The story was overdone. The animation was okay at best. The direction was terrible, and worst during action scenes that focused on random movement and robbed the scenes of any drama. Every plot point was predictable thirty minutes in advance, and absolutely nothing was resolved at the end of the movie - the characters were basically reset to initial positions.

People online blamed this movie's lack of popularity on the fact that it was an animated movie and they're not taken seriously. Perhaps if the studio or the director had taken this movie seriously, then animated movies might be taken more seriously by people. This was the Batman animated series made into movie form, I'm certain it cost them almost nothing to produce, and it's only worth it if you're a massive Batman animated series fan.

Otherwise, this movie is a massive waste of time.",1404000000,,1230,4.899038461538462

If you're watching it for the first time, make sure you're able to really pay attention and not be distracted so you can get completely sucked into the plot, the reveal of who the Phantasm is was very suspensful and made for an exciting finale to the movie!

To be the only animated Batman movie released theatrically, it's a great film that brings a new villain, a great story, and action into one place.  This is the animated Batman of the 90's - grittier than modern animated versions, and not necessarily for young audiences.  It is PG with good reason.

549610,5,6303058957,"This was the first of the Warner Brothers DC Universe full-length movies, released in 1993 (according to IMDB), more than 20 years ago. It still holds up very well, although the studio has definitely gotten better at animation in the past 20 years. And the reason it holds up so well is the quality of the writing. The animation team really knew what they were doing: get the story right and everything else will follow, something that all too many of the live-action comic-book movies have forgotten. As I note in the title of this review, I think that a live-action version of this movie would work very well.

The movie begins with a mob boss, Chuckie Sol, gloating over the quality of a batch of counterfeit bills. His celebration is short-lived, as Batman crashes through a window. Chuckie escapes during the melee, only to run into someone new as he runs to his car, a caped and masked figure with one hand in a gauntlet capped by a razor-sharp scythe blade: the Phantasm of the title. The figure appears to be able to appear and disappear in a cloud of mist. Chuckie is killed in the confrontation, driving his car off the roof of the parking garage as he tries to run down the Phantasm.

We segue to an airplane, where Andrea Beaumont is returning to Gotham City after an absence of ten years. In a flashback, we learn that she and Bruce Wayne had met during her earlier time in Gotham City. These two story lines run side-by-side throughout the movie, as we learn what the Phantasm is after and we learn more about the rise and fall of the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Andrea Beaumont, a relationship that occurred concurrently with Bruce's early efforts at crimefighting, before he had even adopted the persona of Batman. In the present day, these two story lines intersect in ways that I can't reveal without giving away too much. Suffice to say that there are some very interesting, not to mention surprising, plot twists before all is said and done, including the appearance of another well-known Batman antagonist.

I really liked that the movie kept me guessing. Some of it I got right; some of it I was way off. There really is a genuine mystery (actually, more than one) and the way that Bruce solves it is believable. I also like that they focus on Bruce Wayne as much as they do on Batman, and that this Bruce Wayne, at the start of his career, is vulnerable, as we see in some genuinely moving scenes. There is also the occasional touch of humor, with lines like:

Arthur Reeves: [on TV] What kind of city are we running when we depend on the support of a potential madman!

Alfred: What rot, sir! Why you're the very model of sanity. Oh by the way, I pressed your tights and put away your exploding gas balls.

The voice acting is superb, with the ever-reliable Kevin Conroy as Batman, Dana Delaney (better known to fans as the voice of Lois Lane in the Superman television series) as Andrea Beaumont, Hart Bochner as Arthur Reeves, Stacy Keach as the Phantasm, among others. The animation, as I noted above, is a bit dated, so be aware of that. I can still wholeheartedly recommend this movie, though, as one of the best in the DC Universe canon.",1392336000,6,3176,4.553415061295972

549683,5,6303058957,"A mysterious costumed phantasm haunts Gotham City, knocking off mob bosses thus drawing the Batman out from the shadows to stop him. Only when the Dark Knight starts to uncover clues as to who this person might be does he discover how deeply personal this phantasms crusade has become, not just to the phantasm himself, but to the Batman as well.

Pulling out all the stops with top-notch storytelling, animation and direction, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a hallmark in Batmans movie history thats guaranteed not to disappoint!

This movie is unbelievably amazing and rivals even the almighty Dark Knight Trilogy that would begin on the big screen twelve years later. Actually, Mask of the Phantasm was in theatres and I remember going there with a friend and being stunned start to finish at this masterpiece. I also remember being anxious for it to hit home videoand back then, flicks took a looong time to get to videoand the day it came out, I went to K-Mart straight after school, spent some big bucks for the VHS (over twenty, Im sure), then biked home in the rain so I could watch it. It was totally worth that brutal and soaked-to-the-bone bike ride.

This is a serious Bat-flick, both in tone and scope. Brought to life by the same team that managed Batman: The Animated SeriesBruce Timm and Paul DiniIm pretty sure this was the first animated superhero movie to ever hit the big screen. This was also at a time when animated superhero movies never happened. There were only half-hour showstwenty-two minutes, technicallyand that was it.

The story is enthralling, right from the introduction of the mysterious phantasm through Bruce Waynes heartbreaking journey both in the present day and in the flashbacks that showcased his rise as the Dark Knight, all the way to the intense, sobering and heart-wrenching finish.

To this day, Mask of the Phantasm stands as a benchmark of Batman storytelling in my book. Its right up there with the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman 1989, and the other recent animated efforts. Personally, its the finest superhero animated effort ever brought to screen.

The storyline is mature and, probably due to it hitting theatres, was geared toward adults as it clearly contained those kinds of markings (i.e. a hinted-at sex scene between Bruce and Andrea, something that was never in superhero animation before). The violence level was also a notch above the animated series, complete with blood, hard-hitting brutality, and a glimpse into the kinds of real-life physical ordeals Batman would have to go through if he truly existed.

The real strength of the story lies in the fact that as much as its Batman solving a mystery, its Bruce Waynes story, showing us a part of his journey to becoming Batman, what made him finally put on the cape and cowl, and how those events from his past had a direct and painful impact not just on his future, but on the future of Gotham City as well.

The animation is perfect, moody, stylized and has become the benchmark even all these years later of what superhero animation can be.

This isn't a kids movie. This is a serious Bat-movie for the serious Bat-fan who wants to take their Bat-flick experience to the next level.

Highly recommended.",1387756800,,3222,4.831215970961887

The Joker was especially shown as more evil and demented, instead of just the usual menace and "" joking"" villain. My son had many questions and didn't understand why everything was happening like it was. He is bright and does well in school. I watched it with him and realized quickly, but too late, that the content was too mature for a deep thinking child.",1368921600,,651,4.52542372881356

549858,5,6303058957,"Batman Mask of the Phantasm is easily my favorite Batman movie to date. Batman the animated series is my favorite incarnation of Batman. This is based off of that show, which plays a big part in why I love this film.

Firstly, Kevin Conroy's Batman is my favorite incarnation of Batman. He has this presence that, in my opinion has never been topped by any other Batman put to screen. This film delves into his origins and the reason he became Batman, which factor greatly in the story. I really liked what they did with Batman' origin. In my opinion, his origin is handled better here than in even Batman Begins.

I also like Bruce's love interest, Andrea. She is different from most love interests in Batman. She strong and she can take care of herself. I also really bought into their love story, which also plays a big part in the. What I never liked about Batman films and superhero films in general, is that the love interests feel very tacked-on and forced as an attempt to bring in a broader audience. Here the love story is one of the driving factors of the movie.

The Phantasm is a good villain. In fact, he is probably one of my favorite Batman villains. I loved the mystery surrounding the Phantasm. The way everything is unveiled is expertly done. The mystery is very complex, which is something you do not see in a lot of kids films, or even adult films. The Joker also appears in this. He is not the main villain, but definitely had a significant role to play. Mark Hamill's Joker is my favorite incarnation of the Joker. Like Kevin Conroy, Mark has a presence to him as the Joker that has never been topped, in my opinion.

The art and animation is great. It feels very cinematic. The film has a great atmosphere. The score is beautiful. Most of the music is from the animated series, but there is some new music here. Like the animated series, this movie takes a darker tone. This movie, like the animated series, treated its audience more like adults than the live action Batman movies coming out at the time.

Overall, for anyone who is a fan of Batman, this is a must see. I think it is criminal that this film bombed at the box office when it was in theaters, while the childish Schumacher Batman films made all of the money. However, it made back its budget with the video sales, which I am grateful for. This is easily one of the best Batman movies ever made!",1367280000,,2383,4.431506849315069

Although I LOVED what Christopher Nolan did with the Batman character, and to a lesser extent what Burton did as well, BATMAN is at home when he's presented in animation. He was born of the comics and animation makes the character come alive better than any live-action film ever could.

MASK OF THE PHANTASM is so good a story that I wonder why no one has attempted to make a live-action version. Could it be that they already know this film is perfect and re-creating it live would be a useless endeavor? Any one who shuns animation is really missing out by not watching this one.

549951,4,6303058957,"As a fan of the original animated TV series back in the early 1990s, the animated feature film that preceded it was an excellent way of bringing the characters of a weekly cartoon series to the big screen.  Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a classic animated film in its own right.  The film combines the suspense of Tim Burtons live-action blockbuster of 1989 as well as the character driven plots of the animated series.  Only this time, the writers of the cartoon franchise have managed to peal back more of the dark hidden layers of the Dark Knights human persona with the introduction Bruce Waynes one and only love, Andrea Beaumont.  As fate would have it, love and happiness are not so easily attainable for the silently tormented Wayne; and out of the crime ridden streets that have laid waste to Gotham City compounded by the powers of corruption, the legendary crusader that is Batman is born.
 As the years pass, the caped crusaders job hasn't gotten any easier and amongst all of the insanity of the criminal underworld a new and more mysterious villain arises, the Phantasm, a vengefully cunning enigma who has a deadly grudge to settle with Gothams high-end Mob bosses who bear a secret connection to Bruce Waynes former fiances wealthy father.  The action and suspense only builds from there as the city morphs into a deadly and dangerous battleground as police try desperately to intervene in a war between two masked vigilantes with Batman as the prime suspect.  The film lends the voice talents of some very gifted actors of the day: Kevin Conroy delivers a knock-out performance as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Mark Hammil is perfect for the voice of the Joker, Dana Delaney has a very sweet and charming voice for Andrea, and Stacy Keach best known for his narrations on the PBS series, Nova, proves that he can be dark and sinister as The Phantasm.
This film is a wonderful testament to classic animation, in a time when CGI was still in its infancy.  Some of the most memorable cartoon classics like G.I Joe and Transformers still required a talented artist to sit down at his or her desk and draw with pencil and paper true to life characters and environments that would stand the test of time.  In the end, it is the heart and soul of the animators, writers and actors that make the Batman animated series and the animated film, a true treasure of modern animation.  After watching this film on DVD, it still shows nicely.  However, I think that the stereo quality of the overall film needed to be improved and it would have been great to see a behind the scenes documentary on how the actors and crew came together to create Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.",1361750400,2,2669,4.669509594882729

549953,5,6303058957,"Batman year 2 was one of my favorite stories about the character. Done right after year one and featuring artowrk by McFarlane, it was excellent. I remember seeing Mask of the Phantasm for the first time and thinking immediately to myself that this was the same story. The costume of the villain was different and there were some other changes but it is very close to that story. It gives us all a look at how close the Batman came to being able to lay down the cape and cowl for a woman he loved.  It showed many of us how he began fighting crime. It is a great story and this version of Batman was always great. The Art Deco look and feel of Gotham is great.  Mark Hamil as the Joker has always been one of the best voice actors for that character, and nobody should ever voice Batman EXCEPT Kevin Conroy. I recommend this feature to fans of the Batman, it is just as good today as it was when it was released.

The movie is a nice break away from the series, a bit more adult oriented and an interesting back story for the Joker and Batman.

I would think it would ring true to those who try to do a lot of good in life and who experience the pain of deep love lost.  My one real problem with Mask of the Phantasm is the strong implication of sexual relations having occurred at one point.

Unlike the TV series, the Phantasm and the Joker do actually kill people in this film, though there isn't any gore.  I actually expected a bit more from Shirley Walker after hearing her music in the series; however, I did like the score enough to purchase it.  Mask of the Phantasm is one of my favorites, and I would have liked it to be longer.

Plot summary: The arrival of a new and deadly masked figure in Gotham brings Batman trouble from the police and politicians, and gains the attention of the Joker.  While being blamed for murders of mob bosses committed by the Phantasm, Batman then also has to deal with the painful return of Andrea Beaumont, a woman Bruce Wayne had loved enough to give up his alternate life.

550265,5,6303058957,"Animation is all too often written off as being exclusively for children. Yet occasionally there comes along something that, while ostensibly for children, that works perhaps better for adults who might be watching. Batman: The Mask Of The Phantasm (and the TV series Batman: The Animated Series it was spawned from) are perfect example of that. While there's plenty of action in it, the story is full of details and depth that adults would pick up on. The result is an action story with a surprising amount of characterization and plot that puts head and shoulders above many other films both animated and live action.

Much of the films success is done to the voice casting, many of whom reprise their roles for the TV series. Kevin Conroy has proved himself to be practically definitive with his performances as Batman/ Bruce Wayne over the years and this film is no exception. In fact, this film takes Conroy's performance as Batman one step further as we learn of his lost love and how the past continues to haunt this man. The result is a Batman that, while a man of action, is very much human as well and the film is all the better for it.

The rest of the voice casting is splendid as well. Dana Delany gives a moving performance as Wayne's lost love Andrea 'Andi' Beaumont whose past relationship with Wayne, and the secrets surrounding it, lie at the heart of the film. Character actor Stacy Keach gives a fine performance as Andrea's banker father as well as supplying the voice of the mysterious Phantasm. Hart Bochner gives a fine, if somewhat over the top performance as the sleazy Gotham City Councilman Arthur Reeves who orders the hunt for Batman. There's also the performances of Abe Vigoda, Dick Miller and John P. Ryan as the mobsters being hunted by the Phantasm. Not forgetting those who reprise their roles from the TV series such as Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred, Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon and Robert Costanzo as Detective Harvey Bullock or of course even Mark Hamill as Batman's arch-nemesis The Joker who gives a menacing, yet maniacal, performance that's become a trademark of the animated series. All together they round out the film's excellent cast.

The films animation is as fine as well. Using the same animation style as the TV series it was spawned from, the story is perfectly set in a world of shadows where the modern exists blended seamlessly in with art deco influences. This is used to good effect both in the film's flashbacks and its finale as well with the use of a World's Fair like exhibition that serves a fine metaphor for the story as well. The animation, coupled with the score of Shirley Walker, helps brings the world of the film to life.

It is perhaps the films story that is its biggest highlight. The TV series was praised for not dumbing down its stories and the film is no exception. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a film with plenty of action in it with a story full of details and depth that adults would pick up on. Mask Of The Phantasm uses its expanded length to go into back-story that the TV series could never do and the result is a film the is as much as tale of love and loss as it is an action film with rooftop chases, fist fights and the like. There is a genuine love story between Bruce and Andrea and it is that love, its loss and secret consequences that are at the films heart. Yet all the while, Batman finds that the city he's sworn to protect hunting him due to the deaths of mobsters at the hands of the mysterious Phantasm which brings the action and love story together for the films incredible revelations and its finale. The result is one of the best written Batman films yet written.

Overall, Batman: The Mask Of The Phantasm is one example of what animation can do at its best. This is thanks to many elements such as Kevin Conroy's haunted performance of Batman to the fine supporting cast, fine animation, the score of Shirley Walker and one of the best Batman scripts yet written. The result is a film that is, for all intents and purposes, head and shoulders above many other films both animated and live action.",1293321600,,4118,4.566982408660352

Under the Red Hood seems to have a lot more dramatic feeling, faster pace, better climax etc.  That said, this one is a lot more kid friendly than Batman: Under the Red Hood.

I'm also more a fan of super hero vs. super villain than the regular thug/crook stuff.  This one has both but I found it kind of boring for about the 1st 1/2.  That's just my stylistic preference though I'm sure.

Especially after finding out who the Phantasm is, I felt there was some lack of explanation for some of the more spectacular stants pulled off by that character.  In the end it just didn't sit right with me unlike the Red Hood who I felt was well explained.  He didn't have to do anything other than be very agile & well planned unlike the smoke & mirrors here which again, I'm not sure I bought.  It felt forced in order to tell the story.

Decent but dated.  At this point it's so cheap it's still worth a look if you still haven't seen it but Batman: Under the Red Hood is WAY better.",1292198400,,1248,4.241525423728813

550270,5,6303058957,"Having just revisited Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" a couple of days ago, considered almost universally as the best Batman adaptation (and with reason is indeed a masterpiece), I decided to give this animated movie a try. And honestly is pretty damn good, I don't quite remember Burton's movies but I think I'm safe into saying ""Mask of the Phantasm"" is either at their level or better. And the reason is simple the storytelling is pretty good and like ""Batman Begins"" it delves deeper into the psychological, emotional, and moral backbones of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character along with what it means to be a symbol and hero. It also helps there is a love story that feels real. I actually wanted to see more of this period in Bruce Wayne life when things were simpler. A interesting note here is that the Future Land ride they take here awfully resembles the Fleischer's cartoon ""All Fair's at The Fair"" which serves to prove they really took inspiration in the Fleischer's Art Deco style of animation to create Batman The Animated series. The Joker was pretty well played here too, not as a clown but as a complete psycho who could just easily kill you without any reason at all. Towards the end it becomes a little predictable but it never really loses momentum because we care about the characters enough to see them go through every change.",1283385600,,1342,4.714893617021277
550271,5,6303058957,"The very first original animated movie of our favorite caped crusader was this spinoff of Batman: The Animated Series. The story reveals several ""secret origins"", plus goes a step further than the TV series did with its dark subject matter.

Several old mafia bosses keep getting bumped off by a unknown vigilante(never actually called the Phantasm in the movie), but just because he wears a dark oufit and a cape the cops think that Batman is the one doing the killings. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne's old flame, Andrea Beamont, comes to town. Batman thinks there's some kind of connection between her return and the murders. He deduces that all the gangsters were part of an old gang run by the dying mob boss, Valestra. It turns out that the Joker was his hitman, and goes to him to stop Batman who he thinks is the killer. Joker betrays him, and uses him as bait to flush out the killer, and learns that its the Phantasm. Batman then nearly gets caught by the police, but rescued by Andrea who had already known his identity. The masked killer then tracks down the Joker, who figures out that the Phantasm is really Andrea. They fight for a bit, before Joker nearly kills her with a giant fan. Batman shows up to save her, and chases after Joker who almost escapes with a jetpack. But, Andrea makes off with the Joker as his entire hideout blows up. Batman remains unaware of Andrea's fate, although we see her later moping on a cruiser, and obviously Joker survived too.

This movie is probably one of the best stories used in a superhero film ever done, and up until Batman Begins it was definately one of the best Batman movies. Their use of the Joker wasn't just done for fan service, but actually served the story in the end, although it would've been interesting to see Robin in this too. You'd think if his mentor was wanted by the police that he'd look into it. There could've also been a little more interaction between Batman and the Phantasm aside from a brief fight they had that only lasted a few seconds. Aside from this though, the film opens up some major windows into Bruce Wayne's past, and the hard decisions he had to make between leading a normal life or becoming Batman. Most of the other episodes in the animated series didn't go this deep into Batman's character, or his motivation for being a crimefighter. Once again, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are great as Batman and Joker, plus Dana Delany is fine as Andrea, which helpled her nab the role of Lois Lane in Superman: The Animated Series.

550344,5,6303058957,"This is far superior to any recent Batman film (including Dark Knight). For some odd reason, Bruce Timm and the rest of the people behind the DCAU seem to almost get it right everytime. The animation is perfect, the voices are stellar and the stories are compelling and emotional. Like I said earlier, now that the hype over The Dark Knight has died down, I've went on to praise why the other Batman films are better. After Ledger died, I think that's what made the movie so big; an actor's last finished film role (but like I've stated earlier he did a terrific job, though honestly I went to see it due to my liking of the characters and had no idea who Ledger was or what he'd done before and was a little angered at why they didn't get a more seasoned actor to do the role). And also the film's story served more as a character study than what's been done before in the superhero genre (which again is terrific and different). This is done better because its a more personal story than any of the others. Some one frames Batman for the murder of several gangsters while at the same time his former lover comes back to the city (and I must say, she got a lot farther with him than Talia and Catwoman ever did). Even the Joker fits into all this and he's not even featured in most of it. I won't go into the details of the plot as it can be a bit confusing to explain. I did like the emotional struggle within Bruce when he was younger about either going along with the plan or settling down with Andrea. One of my favorite scenes is when he's at his parents grave, practically begging to let him move on. And then when he finally proposes to her, a flock of bats erupts out of the ground, insinuating the fact that he can never be in a real relationship. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprise their roles of Batman and Joker. Conroy gets to spend a little more time as Bruce and ""shows"" the emotion of a man torn between his duty and love. Hamill is the definitive voice of the Joker and the animated version is actually my favorite interpretation of the character. He's not totally insane and he's not the annoying clown figure of the 50s comics. He's an amalgam of both and though the character hardly features until half-way through, he steals every scene he's in. And that laugh is just creepy. If I was in a dark alley and I heard Hamill's laugh and Ledger's laugh, I'd probably be more scared of Hamill's. Dana Delany (who would later provide the voice of Lois Lane on Superman: TAS) also delivers an emotional performance as Andrea, who represents the path that Bruce can take if he ever crosses the line and just murders those he fights. Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. is my favorite incarnation of Alfred. His touching speech at the end towards his master is another favorite emotional scene. Musc wise, Shirley Walker (along with other series' regular composers) delivers a score that's emotional (mainly Bruce and Andrea), action scenes (Batman being chased by cops) and a little creepy (the Phantasm's theme, the Joker and whenever they use the organ). Even her main theme for Batman gets a cinematic upgrade, setting the ominus and forboding tone of the film. If only Warner Bros. had given Timm and Co. the two years an animated film needs, I'm sure this would've been a high-grossing film. Even Siskel and Ebert gave it a more positive review than Returns and Forever.",1254873600,4,3375,4.489430894308943
550345,5,6303058957,"I remember seeing previews on television for this movie a month before I turned three years old. I have a December birthday, and I wanted to go see it in theaters in honor of that; but Mom and Dad wouldn't take me. Now that I think about it, they probably didn't want to deal with the possibility of a frightened child in a theater; nonetheless, it rankled me at the time.

I don't remember how long it took me to finally see Phantasm; I think I was five, but the memory is fuzzy. I saw it on Cartoon Network, and it blew me away. I'm almost nineteen now, and my sister gave it to me on DVD in honor of graduating high school and getting into a good college.

I finally popped it in tonight, and it's just as powerful and heartbreaking as it was when I was five. I broke down completely at the end, when Bruce finds the locket, and I swear I never cry at movies, but then that scene came and I just started wailing. I cried all the way through the credits, and five minutes after that. I can't even describe what I felt, except that it was heartbreak and sadness and the knowledge that Bruce Wayne will never have a happily ever after. I haven't sobbed so hard in years.

So if there are any doubts about whether or not you should buy this movie, let those doubts be dispelled. This is a true masterpiece. The animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is spot on (fans of Superman: The Animated Series will hear a familiar voice). The story is very simple, but sometimes simple is best.

Who is the Phantasm?  And why is the D.A. so intent on labeling the Bat as an evil vigilante.  Even the Joker didn't believe it.

Batman confronts who he is and why he is; how love, though strong, is not stronger than the duty to his parents, to Gotham.

The animation was realistic and spot-on.  Bruce Timm did a great job in co-producing, and I didn't know that Paul Dini (Elfquest comics) had a hand in the script.

Mark Hamill (Star Wars) does a great voice-over as the maniacal, cackling Joker!

The DVD is very barebones, with English and French subtitles, a scene selector and a film trailer.

Bruce Timm had a hand in other great DC animation:

The story line is compelling & the animation is top notch.  We get to see a young Bruce Wayne as he begins his career as Batman.  Very interesting.  The voice talents have also done an amazing job.  Kevin Conroy has become one of my favorite people to listen to.

550442,5,6303058957,"Batman - Mask of the Phantasm is one of the best productions to come from producers Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, following the first season of Batman - The Animated Series.  The animation here is solid, the voice acting is some of the best around, and of course the story is enough to keep any fan of the series concentrated.  This may be a cartoon, but in no ways is it a film generated specifically for the entertainment of children (mature themes are given, though not directly).

Batman finds himself in a web of love, murder, and ghosts of his past as a vigilante known as the Phantasm kills the city's mob bosses, and due to this being's tattered black cape The Dark Knight finds himself bearing the blame of the ghoulish figure's actions.  On the run from the law, Bruce Wayne also has a blast from the past comes to further complicate his already challenging social life.  Andrea Beaumont had almost been the force preventing Bruce from pulling on the cowl as the love of his life, and was set to marry, except Andrea ran out on him at the last minute, and now she has returned, rekindling past flames, causing him to question himself yet again.

Switching back and forth between the main story, and flashbacks to the caped crusader's beginnings, Batman tries desperately to prove his innocence and expose the Phantasm.  Along the way a desperate mob leader, Chuckie Sol, scared that ""Batman"" will ""crucify"" him crosses the line, bring our hero's arch rival, the insane Joker, into the mix of things, which can only spell trouble for all of Gotham City.  This leads to a spectacular fight between Batman and his manic foe in the ruins of the Gotham World's Fair, and Batman's ultimate revelation of the importance of Batman to the people, and why he has always been meant to lead a life alone.

The animation in this picture is fantastic; it's traditional animation at its very best.  The scenery, the settings, everything in here is visually captivating.  The way Batman slinks, and moves through the shadows, and the way Joker seems to move like an overinflated cartoon character helps capture the characters even more than the dialogue, and that's why I love this animation team.  They know how to put a character on the screen, and they know how to make everything they do in this picture WORK.  If this was a silent cartoon you could easily tell the nature of the characters simply by expressions and movements.  In fact I HAVE watched this film on mute, and can instantly recognize the quirks and style of the characters.  Movements alone, you can tell Batman is a troubled, and wants to be alone, that Bruce Wayne is in a constant state of grief from his parents' murder, and The Joker you can instantly recognize a deranged lunatic who doesn't have a care in the world.

This brings us to voice-acting, and Kevin Conroy shows us why he has been titled the definitive voice of the character for over a decade.  Every single voice here is well done, the only shaky one probably lying in the voice of City Councilmen Arthur Reeves.  Voice acting is often under minded, but in Batman - The Animated Series they did their best without even hiring a superstar.

Of course, there's still one that needs to be listed above all others, and that is Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) as the Joker.  Like Heath Ledger in 2008's `The Dark Knight' Mark Hamill is someone who totally loses himself in the role, providing the most iconic portrayal of the character in Batman history (He's been the voice for over ten years, and still has upcoming projects).  When he plays this character he pours all his energy into it, providing a voice that many viewers will not forget (Hamill's voice is always the one I hear when reading The Joker).  You can tell Hamill is someone who loves comics, and loves this character to death.

This film is worth a view by any fan of Batman, and is probably a great follow-up to the animated series if you want to expose a child to the dark nature of the series (I recommend Batman - The Animated Series for kids 8 and up and this movie for when they hit 10).  This is a great film for adults, though not as violent as the live-action films, the emotional level of the story is spectacular.

A solid 9/10 stars for an all around pleasing film",1224633600,,4265,4.580263157894737

So the Dark Knight must find out who is wearing the mask of the Phantasm, while dealing with an old flame named Andrea (who seems to be connected with these recently-deceased crime bosses). Add the Joker (voiced by the excellent Mark Hamill) and you've got a suspenseful story and intense action throughout the movie.

Animation won't disappoint. Voice acting and dialogue are a plus (Joker's one-liners are as memorable as Jack Nicholson's from Batman '89). Shirley Walker's music is spectacular (may she Rest In Peace). And finally, let's not forget the beautiful, but crime-infested city: Gotham City.

550445,5,6303058957,"I have always been a fan of ""Batman: The Animated Series.""  I think I was one of the few people who managed to see this movie spin-off in theatres, and I remember watching the VHS (remember those?) quite a lot as a kid.  I always enjoyed this movie, but hadn't seen it for years until recently.  Rewatching it as an adult, I'm blown away by how well done it is.  Although animated, this movie is in no way a ""cartoon.""  It is a serious, thoughtful, and emotionally rich exploration of the Dark Knight mythos, and a beautifully executed one.

The script deserves a large amount of the praise.  It is a tightly paced narrative that juxataposes the investigation into a series of gangster murders by a being called the Phantasm (and for which Batman is blamed) with an untold tale of a love interest from Bruce Wayne's past, a woman named Andrea Beaumont.  The script deals with some very adult and complex interpersonal relationships, and if you closed your eyes and just listened you would never guess this movie is animated.

The voice cast is also stellar.  I've said before and will say again, Kevin Conroy IS Batman.  He expertly portrays the dual nature of Bruce Wayne and Batman, finding the subtle distinctions in how each expresses emotions and yet always showing that Bruce and Batman are one and the same.  Dana Delaney gives a mature, nuanced performance as Andrea, and quite frankly is the most believable and interesting romantic foil Batman has been paired with on film.  And although he doesn't show up until halfway through the film, Mark Hamill shines as the Joker.

Visually, the increase in budget from the TV series is noticable, but the animation isn't groundbreaking.  The score is good, but because composer Shirley Walker's work on the TV series is so stunning that the film score is less impressive by comparison.  The TV episodes are scored like films, so there isn't a real jump in quality as far as the music is concerned.

The movie is darker than the televison series, and has more adult content.  Although the gangsters die offscreen and words like ""dead"" and ""murder"" carefully avoided, its very clear that they met unpleasant ends.  There is some mild sexual innuendo, and implied sex between Bruce and Andrea.  If you have very young children this might be a concern, but by age 7 they should be able to handle it (and will probably be blissfully ignorant of the sexual content, if my own experience as a child is any indication).

The movie isn't perfect.  Characters make some rather convenient intuitive leaps, and while I applaud the filmmakers for not spelling everything out a couple of plot points could use some slight clarification.  Once the Joker appears, he hijacks the movie and turns it into something very different from what it was.  But overall, this film is very well done, and predates the psychologically dark Nolan films by about a decade.  A must for any Batman fan.",1222128000,,2921,4.748015873015873

There was a time when the animated Batman of the 1990's, voiced by Kevin Conroy and credited largely to Bruce Timm and Paul Dini, was referred to as the greatest Batman screen incarnation ever, and perhaps many still consider that so, but no doubt that status is in contention now that Christopher Nolan's films exist. Nevertheless, this is still one outstanding Batman film that topped any Bat-flick that came before it and at least a couple that came after. Though the visuals mostly look the same as those of the TV show, that show had some pretty good art anyway with its art deco/film noir influence that is perhaps even heavier here. The music is great and we are talking about some of the best voice talent in the business here as Warner always used in its '90's shows. You'll recognize the voice of hottie-hot-hottie Andrea Beaumont as the same voice of the animated Lois Lane from the ""Superman"" series of the '90's, Dana Delany. And who can forget the work of ""Star Wars"" lead Mark Hamill as the legendary Joker? This film was actually originally intended to be a direct-to-video release like later films ""Subzero"" and ""Mystery of the Batwoman"", but the brilliance of the series inspired WB to make it a bigscreen release. Unfortunately, that decision to go bigscreen came a bit late for proper promotion, and ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" didn't make its money back till home video. Luckily, we can all enjoy it now on DVD, but try to seek out the solo release so you can have a choice of viewing the widescreen version or the fullscreen version (the current release that is a double feature with Subzero only has the fullscreen version, but in some places you can still find the solo release if you search for it). The only bonus feature is the theatrical trailer. If you enjoy this one, you'll definitely want to pick up the animated series it sprung from, not to mention the DVD release previously mentioned and the Superman animated series and Justice League shows as well. And for those who loved the latest live-action Batman films, you'll want to check out the Anime anthology movie ""Batman: Gotham Knight"". Oh, and of course, for the full story of the animated Batman of the 1990's, you'll need to check out the series ""Batman Beyond"" and the direct-to-video movie ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"" (but make sure you get the uncut release).",1220140800,3,2756,4.753653444676409

As a long time Batman fan, I would however like to commend the movie on giving time to something I have never seen outside of the comics. That is, that Bruce was trying to fight crime using the skills he learnt during his absence with no thought to a batman persona. When he decided that the criminals did not fear him (despite his anonymous apparel) his child hood memory initiated the idea of what he was to become. Frankly I loved this prebatman vigalante fights.

Also worthy of note is the obvious detriment to his fighting prowess that resulted from his developing romance and Alfred's chilling reaction the first time Bruce put on the cowl.",1217808000,,827,4.550335570469799
550450,5,6303058957,"Go Bruce Timm and all of the other artists who make Batman come alive!

I've been a long time admirer of Batman: The Animated Series and loved that classic style of drawing the artists employed there, which was why it was great to see that same style come to life once again in these animated films of Batman. I liked how the story writers and artists took the opportunity of a feature length film to reveal more of Batman's past, to the time when he was still in college, looking for love, his journey in life, and perhaps that ever elusive redemption he seeks to take away the pain of losing his parents that one tragic night. Surprise to say, in this storyline, we see that someone does make Bruce/Batman smile, but...well...happiness never comes easy for the Dark Knight--and never stays long. This film definitely has great action sequences, beautiful background detail, but what I love the most is the attention to body and facial expression of the characters. This last gem is missing from a lot of animation nowadays and I feel that it's vital for breathing life into a story. When one can see the knit eyebrows and pained expression of Bruce in deciding what path in life he must take, when we see the chemistry between him and his lover, Andrea Beaumont, unfold, when we see  him slowly putting on the Batman suit for the first time, that's quality animation.

I love it! I think I'll check out the other Batman animated films, too. Watch this one to see animation's heart and soul of the '90s.",1214611200,,1504,4.58364312267658

The animation is extremely well done creating a 3-dimensional look to a 2-dimensional genre.  Shading, shadowing, movement and character face definition are all there - just like the series.  We see how and why Wayne becomes Batman and why he remains there and the sacrifices he makes - namely the love of his life and any love for that matter.  There is a good mystery with a twist.  We see Batman bleed, and implied murder and sex.  Batman actually acts with the full range of emotion - sadness, angst, anger, happiness (well as much as our dashing crusader can muster).  This is a much better story than I expected - for a cartoon or any other type of genre.",1212019200,,751,4.518518518518518

I mean commentary is so common even in the worst movies and dvds. and they could not put a simple director or whoever commentary is bad. A simple deleted scene or something would have been so nice.

If you have not seen this film, you are truly missing out. Even if you're not a Batman fan, this is sure to make  you one.

When I got older and later became a fan of Batman: The Animated Series, I checked this out on VHS and from there didn't see it again until I got it on DVD.  Like I've already said, this really is a great movie, as for the DVD itself, it's a good transfer, but lacks bonus materials except the trailer.  Don't let the PG rating fool you for what is really a PG-13 movie because it's darker and more mature than the animated series.

550507,5,6303058957,"Yes, i've seen all the other movies & shows on my favorite superhero, Batman (Oh, we can discredit the lame ""The Batman"" series) & without any reservations i can honestly say the DCAU version of Batman is the best. He's believable in so many aspects (George Gooney should've watched these). The voice alone is so distinct too that anytime i hear another version I imagine Kevin Conroy's tone. Or if i'm picking up a Batman comic, it's the same voice that rings in my ears. Conroy's voice embodied exactly what i have always imagined the Dark Knight to sound like & the TimmVerse animators bring such a perfect sculpting to the character that i really don't need a live actor to take up the suit. I am completely satisfied with this version of Batman & as for the movie, ""Mask of the Phantasm"" this is for fans of the show already. This is a must-see movie for sure. I give it 5 stars, but to better enjoy it pick up the first 2 volumes of Batman the Animated Series & watch them first to get into this character. You will not be dissapointed with this film or any other of the DCAU Batman for that matter. Great writing & animation definitely put this at the top of my list of favorite versions of Batman (Mr. Keaton was a close second). Also note, if you go crazy over this version of Batman, he can also be seen in Superman the Animated Series, he is a founding member in Justice League the Animated Series, & in Justice League Unlimited. For an aged version, watch Batman Beyond. All titles are very well made & alot of fun. Enjoy!",1193443200,,1534,4.385964912280702

However there is trouble brewing ahead, a mysterious villain named Phantasm is killing off gang members one by one and The Joker (Mark Hamil)is next on his list, Batman must find this mysterious killer or still be romancing his love.

This is in my humble opinion the second best Batman movie with ""Begins"" being number one and ""Batman 1989"" as the third. It's totally one of the best animated movies ever and captures the esscence of Batman in every possible way from his DC Comics roots thanks to Series's executive producer and writer Bruce Timm. It's quite true to Bob Kane's creation and is a well crafted animated tale that's more to adults and teens then kids due to the dark nature of the film, Andrea is a total animated babe and really reflects Bruce Wayne's inner-fraustrations lead to him once she left him originally.

Now, one by one, the figure takes down certain crime bosses, but unfortunately, Batman is blamed for this madness! Can Batman find this mysterious being before it slays more criminals? Can he ignite an old flame between himself and the beautiful Andrea: his almost-to-be wife from the past? Time will tell...
In this movie, we not only watch Bruce Wayne piece together clues about the 'Phantasm', but we also look a bit in depth to his whole Batman past, and why he fights crime the way he does. This movie also looks into the past about Bruce and his love, Andrea...and how they're all tied to a crime boss chain...which includes the Joker!

MY OPINION: Well, to be honest, there really isn't much to give my opinion about. Overall, it's a great movie and definetely worth seeing if your a 'Batman: The Animated Series' fan and similar Batman titles. Although...I gave it four stars, because even though it's a really good movie, but it just wasn't as good as I thought; and thus, that's where the four stars come in.

550604,4,6303058957,"""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"" is the theatrical release spun off from the 1990s's great ""Batman: The Animated Series"" from television.  Those unfamiliar with the animated Batman material from this era should check out both the series, the movie, and the subsequent direct-to-video movies from the same line, because collectively they comprise the best pre-""Batman Begins"" filmed versions of the Dark Knight, far surpassing several of the previous, live action, incarnations.

  ""Mask Of The Phantasm"" unfolds on two fronts - the appearance in Gotham of a new crimefighter known as Phantasm, who uses (in direct contrast to the Batman) lethal methods to take out members of Gotham's organized crime groups; and a series of extended flashbacks that take us far more indepth to the early day of the Batman than the animated tv series ever had.  Like the series, the movie tones down the darker elements from the modern-era comic books, and keeps things from becoming too complex, so as to keep the show as accessible to five year-olds as to twenty-five or sixty-five year-olds.  It retains the higher levels of characterization and believability than the live-action Batman movies of the 90s, and in terms of sophistication and detail runs somewhat closer to the comics than the pre-2005 live-actions ever did. It ties the two timeframes it takes place in together very well and fits perfectly with the tv show, incorporating a number of the main characters (and their voice actors) from the series into the flow of the movie, all brought to life by voice acting that's way above the norm for animated comic adaptations.  The distinctive visual look of the series's unorthodox animation style is in full effect here, and is as well-done as ever.  Overall a great movie; well-suited to young kids but older viewers definately shouldn't pass it up on the grounds of it not being live-action.  A solid 4.5 stars",1169856000,4,1906,5.025396825396825

This is not just a ""cartoon""",1155340800,,205,4.54054054054054
550609,5,6303058957,"The animated Batman series of the `90s was an excellent series, and this movie makes for a great companion piece. Judging by the format of this movie, it wouldn't have been possible for the animated series to tell this story for two reasons. First, the violence in this story was too extreme for the TV show - Batman bleeds fairly often, and people are actually MURDERED. I was a HUGE fan of the show when I was a kid, and I loved this movie, but back then I was really surprised by the degree of violence in it. I had expected it to be as tame as the TV show. Regardless, the violence in this movie isn't anything that kids aren't exposed to on a daily basis. But it is rated PG for a reason, and `parental guidance' means that parents should watch this movie with their younger children the first time they see it - just in case the parent needs to explain and/or clarify some of the events in this film to their kids. Second, even if the violence was toned down, this storyline couldn't properly be told if it was simply divided into three episodes for the TV series. The typical episode of the TV series wouldn't be able to handle all the flashback sequences - the TV series was more interested in fast-paced storylines. And the flashback sequences REALLY slow down the pace of this movie. But am I complaining? Of course not. The quality of this movie would suffer greatly without all those slow-paced flashback sequences. So it was necessary that an animated movie tell this story.

Shirley Walker's brooding background music is perfect for this movie - she outclasses every other composer who ever worked on a Batman film. During the opening credits, Walker's title theme is powerful as we see a red sky over a darkened Gotham City, and pass by the towering and foreboding skyscrapers. Her music is especially poignant during many of the flashback sequences, and during the scene when the old World Fair site is completely obliterated. And how about during the last scene in the movie when it shows Batman in deep reflection right before the Bat Signal flashes across the heavens?

The Phantasm is awesome - Batman must find out why he has marked Gotham's biggest mob bosses for death. No one really gets a good look at the Phantasm, and a lot of witnesses mistake him for The Batman. So Batman isn't framed for murder - it's an interesting case of mistaken identity.

Everyone says the Joker steals the show. He certainly is great, but I think this is Batman's movie - they didn't repeat the mistake of Burton's Batman movies. I really like how the Joker is an old-time gangster in this movie, especially since he's deranged and looks freakish. With the black trenchcoat and fedora he's classy and menacing. The film explores his own shadowy past as well.

In various flashback sequences, we see Bruce Wayne's first attempts at being a vigilante. He is sucessful in some respects, but not in others. I'm assuming it's a lot harder to beat up thugs when they aren't afraid of you. He must find a way to strike fear in criminals as soon as they lay eyes on him. The other big problem is his inability to focus during his scuffles with criminals - but it's presumably difficult to put yourself in harm's way when you have loved ones to worry about at home. Since we all know that Wayne becomes Batman, it's obvious that these two problems are eventually resolved.

My favorite part of the movie is when Bruce Wayne first hears that his fiancee has left him forever, then it cuts to the scene where he's trying on the Batman costume for the first time. A silhouetted Wayne pauses to stare at the mask, contemplating the deep significance that it will have on his life. After he dons the mask, Walker's music erupts in dramatic fashion as the terrifying spectacle of The Dark Knight steps out of the shadows, setting off to begin his unending crusade against evil. Indeed, the sight of Batman coldly narrowing his eyes at Alfred (and the look of awe on Alfred's face) makes this one of my favorite scenes in movie history.

One of the most touching scenes is when Batman is on a skyscraper in the rain, watching his former fiancee eating at a restaurant (it sounds sick, but it's not). Walker's music, and the expression of longing on Batman's face as he reflects on his past, is moving. Then Batman's nostalgia is interrupted by a police helicopter - knowing he is a wanted man, Batman is forced to flee before being spotted. So the scene ends on a sentimental note. At the same time the end of this scene is really cool - the way Batman is so stealthy that he can completely disappear from sight (and without a sound) when your attention is diverted for a millisecond.

Most action fans will be disappointed that it's not all action from start to finish, but the action scenes in this movie are very impressive. Batman's raid at a casino was done with lightening speed and efficency. I especially liked how Batman flips a heavy table on one gunman, then afterwards he stomps on the table (and thus the gunman) for good measure. In another scene Batman sights the Phantasm while in the Batwing (which is a really cool jet airplane - the noise it makes as it flies would terrify any evildoer). A chase ensues. But the Phantasm escapes, and to make matters worse the police sight Batman. This leads to one of the coolest chase scenes you'll ever see. The fight with the Joker in a miniture city is excellently done - it seems to have been inspired by the Godzilla movies. Yes, this is one of my very favorite movies - I almost enjoy it as much as Batman Begins. Buy this DVD, and the soundtrack too.",1155168000,,5601,4.545094152626363
550610,4,6303058957,Mask of the Phantasm adds complexity and depth to the Dark Knight in a way not done in film until Batman Begins.

however, the DVD release of this wonderful film is quite disappointing. I owned the VHS prior to buying it, and hoped that the DVD would be an improvement, but it really isn't. the video is in no way re-mastered and has quite a bit of noise, as though it was sourced from a VHS tape. the only reason I gave this release 4 stars is because of how much I truly appreciate this film. sadly, I don't think it is likely that there will be a re-mastered release of the film, but in any case this will do, since I really just want to be able to watch it and not worry about degrading the media every time I do.

if you're a batman fan I suggest you buy either of the two DVD releases; the keepcase is $2 more, but aside from being in a different case, the items are identical.

where do i start? well it has a great story, animation is a bit better than the normal series and also we see a different bruce wayne than usual. we see him dating, having fun and more which i won't mention so that i won't ruin any surprises. And thats why this story rises above other Batman stories, because we rarely see Bruce wayne, usually we see just Batman as a vigilante with no feelings, just his never ending crusade for justice. here we see Bruce wayne, and we learn a lot about him and see him through a new light.

Also you don't need to know a lot about batman to understand the story cause it explains everything, so if its the first time you are watching a batman movie, rest assured that you won't need to know the batman's rich and deep history of character's and events. it's a perfect jumping point for anyone new to the batman, and for fan's it is a great pleasure to watch.

I highly recommend this dvd, even if you are not a batman fan because as storylines go, it is really great. i was surpised to see how good it is, even better than some of the movies like Batman & Robin, and Batman forvever. It has elements of action, thriller noir, romance, and a hint of comedy, especially with Alfred's ( Bruce wayne's butler) witty remarks.

550695,4,6303058957,"In the early 90's the Fox network premiered an all-new animated series based on the adventures of Gotham City's dark knight detective, Batman.  After a couple of successful seasons under their belt, the creators of the ""Batman: The Animated Series"", Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and Alan Burnett, decided to try their hand at their first feature length animated film based on the TV series.  To many this gamble was an unnecessary waste of money, the thought of many critics was why is Warner Brothers pouring money into advertising an animated movie that would be better off airing on TV rather than premiering in theaters.  However, with the release of ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" those critics were silenced, as audiences of the TV series and Batman in general flocked to theaters to see this new animated movie.

""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" begins with many of Gotham City's most dangerous gangsters being eliminated.  The police have no leads other than at every crime scene the Batman (voiced by Kevin Conroy) is always present, eventually suspicions are aroused that maybe Batman has finally lost it, and is eliminating the criminal element in Gotham once and for all.  However, Batman knows that he's not to blame, the problem is the person or being responsible for the murders, known as the Phantasm, is proving difficult to catch, and until he does Batman is #1 on Gotham City's most wanted list.  To make matters worse, this new villain is somehow linked to not only Bruce Wayne's past, but also the past of his worst villain, the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill).  Can Batman survive the combined threat of the Phantasm and the Joker, or will this be the dark knight's final night?

Both the animated series and this movie contain an interesting style of animation that blends modern animation with a very obvious influence of the old-time Max and Dave Fleischer animations of the 1940's.  Terrific vocal performances from all of the actors/actresses, some are regulars on the show, such as Kevin Conroy (Bruce Wayne/Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker), plus some new vocal talents to the Batman world, Dana Delany and Abe Vigoda.  Some critics and even fans felt that this Batman movie, even the animated series, is two of the best interpretations of Batman outside of the comic book medium.  Whatever your feelings are about this series, there is no denying that ""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" is a terrific animated movie that fires on all cylinders from the moment the movie starts and doesn't let up until the credits roll.

""Batman:  Mask of the Phantasm"" is rated PG for violence.",1136419200,3,2595,4.8881278538812785

I loved it!!  Now that I'm older, I love it even more.  The series was clearly made for an older crowd.  So was this movie, for if I had seen it when I was younger, I surely would not have liked it as much as my mother would have!!

The story is very deep, with many twists and also many mature themes.  It also shows an alternate reason for Bruce Wayne choosing to become Batman, which is a broken heart.  Batman Begins did explore Batman's origin, however it cannot even come close to being compared to Mask of the Phantasm.  NO live action movie to date and in the future will ever match the perfection of this film.  Alan Burnett, Bruce Timm and their production team made the most under-rated movie ever.

Every element of Mask of the Phantasm is dedicated to character development and motivation.  Long time Bat-fans are treated to a creative bit of backstory cleverly interwoven in flashback with a new mystery for the caped crusader.  Bruce Wayne is everything he should be in Phantasm; the writers manage a conflicted and emotionally scarred character, but he doesn't come off as un-necessarily brooding.  Sure, tone is dark, but this Batman is still loads of fun!

Shirley Walker's score for Phantasm is equally impressive.  She delivers a Batman that is very personal and almost haunting while still heroic.

It is way better than ""Batman Returns"" (1992; which tends to tilt towards the creepy side) and ""Batman and Robin"" (1997; which seems to slide towards the campy side). It is even somewhat better than all the other movies - ""Batman"", ""Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman"", ""Batman: Mister Freeze"", ""Batman Forever"", and ""Batman Begins"". True, the word ""phantasm"" is in fact never even once uttered at any point in the movie, but so what?

550750,5,6303058957,"After successfully launching Batman: The Animated Series in 1992, the creators were given a green light to do an animated film! While three more have been done since BatMan: Mask Of The Phantasm (1993), this one is easily the best of the four. Only BatMan Beyond: Return Of The Joker comes close to the quality story-telling of this classic.

In this one, we get a peak into Batman's past and how it is affecting his present as a new villian, called The Phantasm, is eliminating Gotham's most prominent gang-lords. A new hot-shot councilman, looking to make a name for himself, blames Batman for the killings. While everything seems to point to The Dark Knight, there is a bigger mystery here as each gangster that is taken out has a link to an old flame of Bruce Wayne. This also includes a former underling of one of the crime bosses who just happens to be Batman's greatest enemy in the present day, THE JOKER!

The animation is very fluid in this one! While Batman is considered a kids show, this movie isn't really for children and there is a reason its PG-13!! While not overly violent or even graphic, it isn't kiddie fair so be warned!

This is the best of the Batman animated films. I would dare say one of the best BatMan films PERIOD! Including the live action films (though I would recommend BATMAN/1989 and the recent Batman Begins). Get this classic!",1123891200,3,1364,4.604938271604938

I even remember my mom being about 10 different Joker action figures because I kept losing them. Well, I've grown up, and I yet I am still enthralled with Batman. I like the Tim Burton live action movies the best, but I love the animated versions as well. And no other animated version (not even the awesome tv series) can compare with this 1993 movie, a masterpiece in the comic book movie genre. ""Batman - Mask Of The Phantasm"" is an animated masterwork that captures the feel of the comic books and adding a sense of film noir to it. In it, Batman is out for the Phantasm, a mysterious figure who has killed some of Gotham's most notorious gangsters. Meanwhile, the Caped Crusader's secret identity, Bruce Wayne, has fallen back into love with his former fiancee, who herself is keeping a dark secret from him that could challenge their relationshiop. The millionaire is thrust into a struggle with duality not unlike the 1989 live action movie ""Batman"". To complicate matters even more, none other than The Joker himself has returned to wreak havoc on Gotham City once more. Torn between the love of his life and the safety of Gotham, Batman/Bruce Wayne now faces his most demanding challenge ever. It all leads up to a dazzling finale at an abandoned World's Fair between Batman and his two adversaries, concluding with an ending that will stay with you forever.

The story is told partially in flashbacks, some of which unfortunately rehash the already well-known origin of Batman. Others, however, give us a brief glimpse into the background of the Joker, who makes one of his most memorable appearances here.

550755,5,6303058957,"This is the first motion picture derived from the classic 90's TV show from Warner Bros. With all the team from the animated series behind it, this film takes you via flashbacks to the origins of Batman and expands them to include a love story that led to the events presented on the film.

Directed by Eric Randomski and Bruce Timm, with a story written by Alan Burnett and music arrangements by Shirley Walker on the original Danny Elfman score for the first Burton film, this movie is a perfect example on how a Batman movie must be. Keeping the dark tone of the series, the movie tells the story of a new killer in Gotham (the Phantasm) who is dispatching the principal Mob bosses of the town. As this happens, one of the bosses seeks for protection from the Joker, Batman tries to catch the killer and we see flashbacks on how Bruce Wayne decided to become Batman. The variant here form the original story is that Wayne falls in love and has to make the decision between choosing his happiness with her loved one and fulfilling his promise to his parents. Some new characters are introduced here and we also get to see a young Joker doing his `dirty' business.

The story is absorbing and even though the identity of the killer might be guessed early in the movie, it is great to see how the mystery unfolds as Batman fights both the Phantasm and the Joker in an unbelievable sequence at the end of the movie. The music arrangements by Shirley Walker do justice to Elfman's score and fit perfectly into the best parts of the movie. Since this film was released in theatres the animation is quite improved from the one on the show.

No more extras available than the theatrical trailer, but the movie itself is worth every penny spent. An excellent take on the myth of the Batman.",1121472000,,1784,4.5

In fact, the only people who wouldn't like it are people who hate both Batman and cartoons, because if you're a fan of just either one, there's something in Mask of the Phatasm to appreciate.

550828,5,6303058957,"Back when the film was released, my dad gave me a copy of it on VHS and I always loved it but after awhile as usual with things, you lose track of it and forgot where it was. Out of town one year, bam, there it is on the shelf so I nabbed it. Like a lot of reviewers have said, it combines the dark film noir style with that over-the-topness of the films.

One thing I never really got with the films is Bruce Wayne's complexity. Although on a show that has a different superhero, to paraphrase Smallville's Chloe Sullivan, Bruce Wayne has more issues than Rolling Stone. He made a vow that he would protect the innocent.

Basically the story is that mob bosses are being killed off by a grim reaperesque villain named the Phantasm(although oddly, that name's never mentioned). However, due to the image of the Phantasm's costume and blink and you'll miss it images, Batman instead gets blamed. None of which is helped by a commissioner who has it in for him, probably his one true love returning, and his battle with an old nemesis.

One thing has got to be said first off: this is one amazing score. The woman responsible did an astounding job and the opening theme is great. The voices are great too. Kevin Conroy does 2 voices(although slightly similar) voices for Batman and Bruce, so that way people close to him wouldn't figure out his voice if they met Batman. And who knew that Mark ""I'll always been known as Luke Skywalker"" Hamill would give a crazier performance as the Joker than Jack Nicholson?

One thing that's nice about the film is that it is quite dark. There's quite a few flashbacks and they're not quick either. There's a certain amount of complexity to the plot for the kiddies but adults will understand it. It's nice to see a different version of how Bruce Wayne started becoming Batman, and his inspiration for the Batmobile's a nice touch.

Like most people that are fans of this, we're waiting for a DVD release. If they're has been one, then an SE one cause I've never heard of it. Rumors are that they'll release it along with the Tim Burton Batman films to coincide with the release of Batman Begins in June which should be interesting.

The way this movie is done was actually so wel thought out, it puts most live movies to shame. First off, this movie is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman himself and shows his past with his true love. The setup is pretty much someone is going around killing off the mob bosses and the police believe its Batman. A connection is found when his once true love and her father returned who ran away from these mob bosses many years ago. Is it one of them doing it or someone else? Great movie that shows the origin of batman, and no, not the parent killing part but the true beginning with his first mission before he chose the costume. Also shows the early days of the joker and one of Bruces loves (he had many, though whats funny is that on an episode of Batman Beyond, they showed every one of Bruces past loves except for this one which was odd).

550836,1,6303058957,"Although the animation and voice talent was tremendous (even had Abe Vigoda - love that gravelly voice) the story line was so weak and the resolution was not thought through.  It was like the producers said ""Ooh!  Let's have a hot sexual theme because we are now in a theater and can avoid the censors!""  Any Batman fan knows he forsook love because of his dedication to his second persona (Batman).  In Mask, Batman appears weak and controlled by his libido.  I was uncomfortable with the scene implying [physical interaction] had taken place between Bruce and Andrea.  The blatant sexual story didn't fit with Batman as how we have come to know him.  Nor did it fit with the masterful animated series, which used subtleties so powerfully.
In the Ras-Al-Ghul episodes, his romance with Talia is cinematic, his affection for and implied dalliance (Cat Scratch Fever) with Catwoman fit with the series and Batman's character.  Even his chick from the past, Zatana, is acceptable.  This is because at all times, Batman remains in control of his emotions.  In Phantasm, he acts like a pimply fourteen year old, even spying on Andrea in plain sight with binoculars!
The movie's resolution was extremely sloppy.  The Phantasm was a compelling character, but the strength and movement the Phantasm displayed was never explained, like a Scooby Doo episode, when the monster's head is pulled off and reveals weak ""Uncle Albert.""  Also, the Joker and Harley are depressing rather than scary/humorous as in the series.
I love Batman: the Animated Series.  I went to a lot of trouble to tape every episode.  I even put the tapes in a safe deposit box at one point, when I lived in an apt. with incidents of crime.  When I saw the poster for this film, I was dizzy with delight.  When I came out of the theater I felt sick to my stomach and almost cried.

This is still the best Batman story that was ever conceived, and worth 5 Stars.
Actually, I added this review for one production value, and I don't know if the DVD touched on it.  All animation is done by adding lines and then color to a white backdrop - except this one.  Here, they colored on a black background.  The effect works absolutely well.

550948,5,6303058957,"This is probably the greatest recreation of the Batman characters ever, Tim Burton's spectacular flick included. Gotham's simplistic but dark, tall, and gothic (pun VERY MUCH intended) style, the way that most of the scenes in ""the present"" were never during the day, the ingenious use of flashbacks, all came together to make a visually stunning movie. And this was a cartoon that didn't pull its punches. It was one of the only ""kid-oriented"" animated films to recieve a PG rating back in the 90's.
The voice cast was spectacular. The characters of Comissioner Gordan, Detective Bullock, Alfred; all are wonderfully cast (I would argue that this movie has the best Alfred of any Batman film EVER). And of course, the casting of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman and The Joker respectively) in a reprise of their roles on the show couldn't have happened any other way, simply because they embody these characters so well, and put far more heart into their performances than you get from many live-action parts (read: the last two live-action Batmans).
The story is both simple and complicated at the same time. Sure, some kids won't get all of it, but the thing is rated PG for a reason. A killer has shown up in Gotham, a murderer who is offing mob bosses with brutal efficiancy. The D.A. blames Batman, and starts a city-wide manhunt. On the Bruce Wayne side of things, an old flame has returned to Gotham (voiced by Dana Delany, the same dame who did Lois Lane in the Superman animated series; funny ol' world, in' it?), who is, in a roundabout way, the reason Batman was able to exist. Bruce is torn between his love, and the responsibilities of, and new dangers to, his secret identity. Batman is turned into a fugitive by the police, even as he tries to unmask the mysterious ""Phantasm"" murderer, and tries to keep his head together as Bruce Wayne all the while. There are a LOT of flashbacks, all of which give us a lot of insight to Bruce Wayne, Batman, and even a little about the Joker. Of course Joker gets involved eventually, (Mark Hamill RULES), and we get one of the greatest battles between the two arch-nemeses ever put to screen. Honestly, it makes the battle on the clock tower in the 1989 ""BATMAN"" seem downright tame, and that's no small feat.
Another great part of the movie is the love story. It is iconic of the comics, and easily the best love story in an american-made animated film. Also, it doesn't feel the need (like so many other animated films do) for everything to have a perfectly happy ending. It's like things turn out in life, and how things always seemed to end up in the comic book. Ironic how this animated Batman can feel more real than the live-action ones at times.
Not to put down Tim Burton's movies in any way (I absolutely loved Batman, and Batman Returns was, aside from the butchering of Penguin's character, a more than worthy sequel), this is the REAL Batman movie. It shows parts of his origin, gives a glimpse of his phsyche, and explores the darker sides of Batman's quest for retribution, what he could have become. An astounding movie, though really not for kids under six. Make no mistake, this film deserves a place of honor right next to its (original) live-action counterpart.

Batman:Mask of the Phantasm goes into detail about a specific time of Batman's life. It tells his origin. It shows us a love that he had. A woman that he loved. A woman he wanted to marry.

550954,5,6303058957,"To me Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm is one of the best, if not THE best superhero adaptation ever. It has some unique qualities among, I think, ALL superhero onscreen adaptations:
- Animation is more friendly to comics than film - I'm getting more and more to this conclusion. With animation, there's no fuss about costumes or CGI or make-up. It allows the movement and sound and some of the 3-D effect you can't get from a comic book without things looking too campy or silly.
- Extreme faithfulness to comics - This feature is a smart and tight combination of the Year One and Year Two storylines. There's nothing here to piss-off fanboys: no stiff rubber suit, no leather jackets, no skinny guy as the hero, no caricatural or Power-Rangish villain - the Joker is actually quite creepy - no turn-back-in-time ending.
- Spot-on characterization - Like a lot of two-hour movies don't get to, this hour-and-a-half piece gets to cover in a fitting way all the basic issues of the character: why he can't get over the death of his parents and try for a happier existence, why he uses a dark symbol to fight crime, why he works outside the law, why he isn't a murderer, whether he's as crazy as his enemies or not. His skills are all featured as well: the womanizing playboy facade, the detective, the scientist, the martial artist, the acrobat, the badass. It finds na ideal way to tell his story, connecting past and present. You get to see a lot of Bats at the prime as you also get to follow his first steps.
- Great romance story - I never thought a romance story with Bats would work - at least if it didn't involve Catwoman. But this one is incredibly fitting with Bruce's character arc. Andrea, at first, seems to represent the lighter side of what he could have had - a happier, more normal life. Then she turns out to be the darker side - the murderous, all-about-revenge vigilante he could have been. It's also a rare case of a great Batman story that focuses a lot on Bruce Wayne, giving it a very human appeal.
- The scene where Bruce asks to be released from his promise could well be the most poignant superhero moment onscreen ever: never a superhero begged so hard to put all this madness behind him, and never had so much of a right to: when Supes decides to give up on his powers for Lois, the audience goes, ""don't do that, you moron! The world needs Supes more than ever! That chick isn't worth it!"" Not to mention Clark LOVES being Superman... When Bruce says, ""It doesn't hurt so bad anymore. I can give money to the police... to hire more cops. Let someone else take the risk"", even a hardcore Bats fan has to think, ""you know what, that makes sense"". A robot would feel sorry for Bruce when he says, ""I didn't expect to be happy"". Yes, a character can be brooding and emotionally difficult and still engage and touch the audience, Mr. Ang Lee...
- It broke ground for feature animation - like the animated series on TV, this feature did a lot for its genre. Superhero movies usually make their innovations on the FX area, but for the time, MOTF was very unusual for an action animation, even more in its storytelling than in its technical qualities.

550995,5,6303058957,"Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, the team behind the critically acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series, created this 1993 animated feature film that perfectly captured the essence of the Dark Knight.  Not Burton's Batman, and certainly not Schumacher's, but underneath the surface of this animated masterpiece is almost everything that long time Bat-fans have looked for in a feature film.  Mixing a re-cap of Batman's origin with the spirit of Frank Miller's landmark interpretation of the character; we are given a more in depth look at everyone's favorite schizophrenic super hero than has ever been seen on film before.  The storyline picks up when a mysterious masked figure called the Phantasm begins picking off Gotham City's top crime bosses.  What is most shocking about Mask of the Phantasm isn't the amount of violence and death in a PG rated animated film, but the emotional impact that underlines the entire film; something the live action movies couldn't entirely do.  Kevin Conroy is his usual excellent self as the voice of Bruce/Batman, while Mark Hamill delivers his usual perfect performance as the Joker.  The animation may look a bit dated, but those who grew up with the animated series (like me) will no doubt appreciate it.  All in all, long time Batman fans who missed out on this little gem should definitely pick this up.",1060732800,5,1340,5.009009009009009

From the film noir style of the characters and the backgrounds to the story line (worthy of the first two live action films) to the vocal talent, this movie is just that damn good.  I've been a fan of amimation since childhood and everything is impressive about BATMAN - MASK OF THE PHANTASM.  This could have been a replacement for either of the Joel Schumacher disasters.

For starters, this movie features one of the coolest intros in movie history. The opening theme, combined with a flight through Gotham City is absolutely spine-chilling. From there we are treated to a typical Batman crime-fighting scene with a twist. Someone is killing organized crime big-shots, and looks a bit like Batman. Naturally practically the whole city is soon after him, trying to bring him in (or kill him). Nothing like being on the run from the cops to slow down your investigation of a creepy serial-killer.
Of course the thing that gives the movie real emotional pull is the girl who comes out of Batman's past and back into Gotham city after being away for years. What does she have to do with Batman's past? And how is she involved with strange murders that have been taking place? Be forewarned, this is a flashback movie. Scene after scene links to a flashback where we see just what was going on in Bruce Wayne's life as his plan came together and he turned into Batman. But for what it's worth, I feel this is the best movie I've ever seen when it comes to flashbacks.
And of course, no comic book movie would be complete without a showdown. And this one is awesome. In a fantastic ending unsurpassed (in my opinion) in any comic book film, Batman must confront both the new threat fo the Phantasm, and his old Nemesis... The Joker.
For fans of Batman, this movie (and the show it is based on) should definitely not be missed. For fans of the TV show, there simply is no excuse not to see this movie.",1051660800,2,1743,4.5015772870662465

Not having known anything about this amimated feature I initially suspected that this was going to be an adaptation or reinterpretation of the DC Comics mini-series, ''Batman: Year Two,'' in which a similarly costumed vigilante from Gotham's pre-""Batman"" era, called ''The Reaper,'' came out of retirement in order to continue a 'crusade' of his own, one which he had started decades earlier.
Although this is a completely different story, it OBVIOUSLY borrows much from that original ''Reaper'' storyline, using many of the same (or very similar) elements, plot devices, costumes, romance-related inner conflicts, etc.
In this story, the ''Phantasm'' is a new character (not a figure resurrected from Gotham's past) who is on a specific mission of vengeance, rather than expressing disgust at Gotham's general degradation and responding to it as a ''crime-fighter'' with a loose cannon. Here, numerous plotlines merge and intertwine, which involve, among other things, Bruce Wayne's relationship with Andrea Beaumont, the only woman he had ever considered marrying, (very similar to his relationship with Rachel Caspian in the ""Reaper"" storyline ... the different twist being that in the ""Year Two"" series Miss Caspian cancelled her plans to dedicate and devote her life as a nun in order to marry Bruce), Andrea's father's unusual connection to organized crime -- as well as his secret connection to the murderous ""Phantasm"" (again, very similar to Rachel Caspian's father's unusual connections to the criminal underworld in general, as well as his secret connection to the murderous ""Reaper""), and a ''NEW'' (i.e., ""different"") revelation of the origin of the Batman's arch-nemesis, the unstable and ruthless ""Joker.""
Not quite as engaging and intense as ""Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker,"" but still very gripping and enjoyable ... especially taking into consideration that it's an animated feature (which actually does more to preserve the legend of the Batman than any of the ''live-action'' attempts, which all inevitably dumbed the legend down). It's just too sad that the animation itself is so unrefined.

This movie is a first class mystery-drama.  The characters are well-developed, as are the plot situations.  In my opinion, ""Batman:  Mask of The Phantasm""  is the best Batman movie ever put out, surpasing even the first Tim Burton directed film as far as over-all quality.

Mask of the Phantasm was compleately differant. It delved into the character of Batman and his past. It's quite simply the best Batman film, live or animated.

While Mask of the Phantasm is animated, this film should not be mistaken for a children's cartoon.  The plot is sophisticated, providing more insight into Batman/Bruce Wayne's personality than any of the dreck that Tim Burton has turned out.
The story is told partially in the present and partially through flash back.  Someone is knocking off some old time crime bosses and Batman is the primary suspect.  I don't want to give too much away, but the flash back sequences link back to when Bruce Wayne was first becoming Batman.  The love of his life has returned, and Bruce/Batman is faced with some difficult decisions regarding the price he has paid to wage his war on crime.  The great thing about this movie is the characters.  Bruce Wayne is a multifaceted character whose hopes and dreams have become subrogated to his Batman persona.  This movie really explores that aspect of his personality.  Make no mistake, like any Batman film, there's plenty of action but the story is character driven.  The voice talents are excellent.  Kevin Conroy has really defined the Batman character.  Dana Delaney gives the Andrea Beaumont character a sensual vivacity that hasn't been seen in any of the female characters in other Batman films.  Mark Hammil is perfect as the Joker.
The DVD production is solid if unspectacular.  The picture is crystal clear and really serves to highlight the palette of colors employed by the artists.  The film is intended to have a noir-like quality, and this is really felt on the DVD.  The DVD comes with the widescreen presentation on one side and the pan and scan on the opposite side.  The soundtrack has been reproduced magnificently.  The score and the sound effects really resonate with strong clarity.  My complaints are twofold.  At times the dialogue seemed rather muted when compared with the overpowering sound effects.  I found myself constantly turning down the volume during the action scenes and cranking it up again during dialogue.  The dialogue seems particularly muted, since I had to turn the TV volume higher than usual.  It would've been nice to see more extras.  Other than the trailer and a french language track, there's nothing else here.  If you're looking for a Batman fix or a solid film, this is the purchase for you.",1016841600,5,2431,4.885085574572127

Mask of the Phantasm demonstrates the art of storytelling in it's finest form.  It retells the story of Batman while incorporating the original story of the Phantasm, a new villain.  And of course, this film wouldn't be complete without the Joker, who is portrayed brilliantly by Mark Hamill.  The voice he uses for the Joker is absolutely perfect, blending humor and psychoticism.
Don't be fooled by the fact that this is a cartoon, either.  The tone is just as dark as the comic book, if not darker.  While there are some humorous points, for the most part, this is a very dramatic, very tragic film.  It does do a nice job balancing out those aspects with the action, which is very good and very creatively done.

But that's what BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM is. Many swear that BATMAN (89) or BATMAN RETURNS are the best films featuring The Dark Knight. Obviouslly they have yet to see this film.
While the story is slightly mediocre, it is far better then that of 89 and RETURNS. It's a tale of lost love, vengeance, and madness. Not the kind of themes one expects for a mdeium long associated with childern. And it handles them all in a mature, realistic fashion that never insults the viewers intelligence.
This Batman is not only scary, but a serious threat to criminals. Instead of standing around and using gadgets he leaps, kicks, and punches. Then he'll throw a batarang to disarm a foe. Kevin Conroy has the right voice for Batman. Dark, menacing. But he is also capable of doing Bruce Wayne in a slightly higher pitch so that the two sound nothing alike. Something anyone from Keaton to Clooney never even attempted.
The main foe is a new vigilante called The Phantasm who emerges from a cloud of smoke. Unlike Batman he kills criminals, which results in Batman being framed for these murders and fleeing from the police. Of course these crimes get the attention of The Joker, who believes he's next.
Ah, Mark Hamil as The Joker. His performance is perfect. Chilling and oddly funny at the same time. His Joker gets notice but never steals the spotlight. Too bad that can't be sad of other films.
Toss into this Andre Beaumont, a red-headed beauty from Bruce's past. They loved each other before he donned the mantle of the Bat. They were even engaged to be married but her father came between them. She left for Europe and when she came back she was engaged to another.
As an aside, their are flashback in this movie. They explain the relationship between Bruce and Andrea. As well as the origins of the Batmobile, the Batcave, and why Bruce dresses as a giant bat.
So if you are a fan of The Batman you can not go wrong with this film. It shows you who the character is, how he operates, his world and its rules, and his villains with rules of their own.

551236,4,6303058957,"But it's way too short. At only 76 minutes you begin to wonder why they bothered. The story is barely given a chance to be intriguing and it is told in a very confusing way with too many flashbacks and flashbacks that go into their own flashbacks. But it still retains that dark edge the 2 previous movies had and many visual thrills.
This movie tells the tale of how Bruce Wayne became Batman in a little more depth than the live-action films and gives us the discovery of the Batcave in a slightly different way than that in BATMAN FOREVER. The Joker is as crazy as ever, the thugs and hoods are as nasty as they have always been and the identity of the Phantasm surprised me.
Although much of Danny Elfman's theme is missing the music is still powerful and involving. The animation is very good and has many elaborate `sets' and locations. The visual style still sticks to that of the comic book like glue and it all makes for a very exciting film. Even if it is a bit of a confusing one, especially for kids.
The DVD is in Dolby 2.0 Surround and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.78:1. The picture is a little grainy but is clear and clean enough to make it worthwhile. The soundtrack is full of life and the score is well recorded and adds immensly to the atmosphere.",1010102400,9,1270,4.362869198312236

551238,5,6303058957,"This is a major work of modern art, the kind of film DVDs were invented for.  As you watch it, you are torn between enjoying the fast-paced action narrative, or wanting to freeze each frame to savour the astoundingly rich and resonant images, all magical outpourings of pure Pop Art.  The animation contrives to allow you do both - the slightly stilted movement simulates the act of reading a comic book.
The visual architecture is breathtaking, huge art-deco nightscapes painted with Precisionist depth - imagine 'Metropolis' redesigned by Georgia O'Keeffe.  This architectonic geometry extends to every aspect of the narrative - the reeling choreography of the set-pieces, including a spectacular showdown between Batman and the Joker in a disused, explosives-primed, futuristic theme park, all swirling, carnivalesque horror; the complex double narrative, switching between the present day plot (who is the strange Phantasm wiping out the city's gangsters?) and the lengthy flashbacks retailing the protagonists' history; the film's themes, criss-crossing the past, present and future, especially the way the two leads (who meet in a graveyard, and visit a futuristic exhibition) are emotionally paralysed by their need to avenge an horrific past, but also the trashcan of American pop culture, the dregs of which are brought to grotesque, surreal life here.
These intersections - of image, plot, environment and character - combine to create an artwork of unutterable beauty, its nostalgia for a period of characteristically American (rather than blandly global) pop culture echoed in the tragic melancholy of the characters, a sadness the equal of Tim Burton's Batman classics.",1001635200,4,1682,5.486486486486487

We see why people fear the Batman the moment he  first dons the mask when alfred, who bathed him as a child... nah... that would be telling.
We see the agony and the pain of Bruce's loss and hear the line... ""It just doesn't hurt as much anymore...""

If the people only knew that despite using the animated medium that ""serious movie goers"" seem to have stigmatized as child's fair, this was as interesting, mysterious, thrilling and well done a Batman flick as one could ask for.  The origins of the Dark Knight are given to us in poignant flashbacks that are relevant to the plot (unlike the similar scenes in ""Batman Forevor"") and all the characters are deep and add to the beauty of the Batman mythos.

This movie is about a secret life about Bruce Wayne that will answer all your questions of did he ever had a happy life?

I've been a Batman fan for more than a decade, but I haven't seen a Batman movie that is as tragic as this one, the original Batman movie by Keaton/Burton comes close, but it doesn't touch this.  The comics, especially the graphic novels portrays Batman as a powerful, strong warrior of justice as well as the most loneliest man alive.... THIS MOVIE UNDERLINES IT.  I've also seen most of the old Batman cartoons, which ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"" is evolved from, but none of those is as sad as this.  If you love the legend of the Batman, the graphic novels, the whole mystery that surrounds this phenomenon, this movie is as good as it gets.  This movie made me so sad, I felt like crying at the end, this only means this movie is that GOOD.  I highly recommend this, this is 100% Batman.",984268800,,937,4.4186046511627906
551333,4,6303058957,"This animated movie tries to get a lot done, and it falls just shy of being a total success.  That said, it is still extremely good, doing a better job than any other Batman script I've seen of showing the price Bruce Wayne pays to be Batman.  Most of the time, Bruce Wayne comes across as the disguise Batman wears when he needs to interact with people -- but in this movie, you get a sense of who he might have been had he chosen a different path.  And while the movies and comics have taken to depicting the more sysfunctional elements of Batman's personality, he comes off as a far more stable and sympathetic character here.  The character exploration of the script is pulled off with great success by Kevin Conroy.  In fact, all the voice actors -- especially Mark Hamill as the Joker -- do an excellent job.  There are also a number of good action sequences, and the final confrontation between Batman and Joker is well done.  (In fact, I'd say it's probably more intense in a way than anything on the recent Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker movie, which I don't think rises to the level of Mask of the Phantasm, even taking the deleted-scene controversy into account.  But I digress.)
So where does this fall short?  In bouncing back and forth between flashbacks and the present, the mystery that drives the plot winds up getting somewhat short shrift -- there are too many unexplained leaps of logic made by the script and by the characters.  It's certainly not enough to ruin the movie, but the few nagging questions that remain afterward take away just a little bit from my enjoyment of the movie.",983577600,3,1610,4.539792387543253

In Mask of the Phantasm, a figure has come to Gotham killing off mobsters one by one. This Phantasm, from a distance, bears a similar resemblance to Batman. Soon the cops figure that Batman must be behind these killings. Batman must try to expose the Phantasm and clear his own name.
A subplot to this story is the origin of Bruce Wayne's vigilante character and eventual metamorphosis into Batman (in cartoon continuity, of course). Even the Joker makes an appearance.

551336,5,6303058957,"Mask of the Phantasm is an on-film example of what not only the movie franchise, which was terribly ruined by Joel Shumacher, could have done with the character, but of how much better the 1990's Animated Series, good as it was anyways, could have been if it was scheduled in prime time instead of during the Kid's Hour. Don't get me wrong; the show went further then then any other long-running animated series yet has (with the possible exception of The Transformers back in the 80's) in terms of skimming close to adult level sophistication and dialogue. Still, this film shows how much better still the Animated Series could have captured the essence of the comic book Dark Knight if American adult audiences were more accepting of animated shows that were not purely idiotic sitcom fare (i.e., The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, etc., ad nauseum). Unfortunately, for any super-hero series to get done, it has to be made 'kid-friendly' and put on Saturday or Sunday mornings, or weekday afternoons, in order to get a chance at the small screen (with the only few exceptions being MTV's Aeon Flux and HBO's Spawn, though these weren't really marketed for a mass audience, which may have contributed to their short life spans despite their success). This is quite unfortunate. What is also unfortunate is that no more Batman animated movies are likely to get onto the big screen after the very undeserved failure of this one, simply because audiences couldn't be bothered with going to see a 'serious' animated movie, unless it was a 'family-friendly' Disney epic. Thus, successive entries in the direct-to-video slot like Sub-Zero were made in the same mold as the series was, and was not given the PG rating that Mask of the Phantasm was awarded. WB has not yet attempted to snare the adult audience whose attention it caught with its super-hero shows of the 90's, and the failure of this one attempt to do so makes the odds of successive efforts in the future dim. I am hoping that a good deal of direct to video support of this film will get us more PG rated animated Batman movies from WB now that the TV series has apparantly run its course for good thanks to, of all things, the success of Batman Beyond, more's the pity. This big screen treatment of the Dark Knight was even closer to the great comic book version in tone, sophistication, action sequences and dark film noir then the animated TV series. The origin of Batman was told in a manner that could not have been conveyed on the more 'kid-friendly' TV version. The Joker was here in all of his insane glory, and we were now able to see him at his peak of homicidal brutality, which was especially welcome since we were not allowed to see the Clown Prince of Crime kill anyone on the TV series, which took away his most distinctive, if chilling, attribute. Finally, we got to see his twisted schemes cause people to buy the farm, including the use of his trademark 'smile venom', even if the filmmakers made sure that only other gangsters were his victims here. No longer did viewers have the comfort of knowing that all people onscreen would be inevitably saved from death by the Dark Knight that we were guaranteed in the TV series thanks to network restrictions for kid shows. The Phantasm was a way cool new anti-hero who seems to have been inspired by the brutal vigilante known as the Reaper from the Batman: Year Two comic book storyline, but with even more spectral aspects added (although the Reaper didn't turn out to be...well, I won't spoil things for those who haven't seen this great animated film yet). The dialogue, storyline and onscreen pathos were great. Also, a surprising amount of blood was seen in this film, even for a PG-rated movie, which was in stark contrast to the only occasional blood allowed for the TV series. This virtually unrestrained ability to show blood and death may turn off some parents, but was much more attuned to the type of serious crime drama and psychological thriller that the Batman character most logically embodies. However, no expletives at all were used in the film, not even minor ones; this silliness was in tune with a criticism I once heard of the original 1931 version of Scarface, in which the original filmmakers were allowed to show tons of brutal gangland murders, but no character in the movie was allowed to say anything as ""horrible"" as ""damn"" or ""hell"" (even though the Al Pacino remake more then made up for the loss of strong language in the original). This is no biggie, however; a lack of unrealistic language didn't destroy tons of good storytelling and realistic action. The scenes of Bruce Wayne attempting to fight crime before taking on the Batman moniker, when he was totally wet behind the ears as a vigilante, was also a welcome change that cemented into our heads the fact that Batman is a very human being under the suit that didn't become the master crimefighter that he is overnight.  I highly recommend this film to all diehard Batman fans, even those who may not have religiously followed the Animated Series for whatever reason (lot's of American adults just seem to have a bias against any film or show that is animated since we are so socially conditioned to think that anything animated is automatic kiddie fare despite a decade of The Simpsons and its numerous prime time offspring, both good and bad). Any action or martial arts fan will also like this movie, as well as fans of Japanese anime, especially of the Street Fighter animated episodes from Japan. In short, if you like Batman, action flicks or anime, you will love Mask of the Phantasm. As stated above, this film is also heartily recommended if you are simply curious to see what the series could have been like if aired in prime time for a more adult audience.  Kudos to WB for making this bold attempt, even if this particular one didn't work out as well as they hoped. I am hoping they will learn from the previous, if short-term, successes, of Aeon Flux and Spawn that there may indeed be a market for more adult super-hero/action fare if only they will someday take another chance with this largely untapped genre in America.",975110400,10,6152,4.705936920222634
551337,5,6303058957,"It's unfortunate that an animated series rarely gets serious attention, even when made into a movie, like Mask of the Phantasm.  The writing is superior to the live action Batman movies, and the movie has more self-respect.  We delve into Batman's past: not his why-I-became-Batman past which everyone knows; rather, we learn why he remains Batman despite the intense personal cost.  This is a great movie, with a great voice cast (including Mark Hamill <yes, Luke Skywalker> who is just perfect as the Joker).  The score is wonderful, playing a little with the score from the first Michael Keaton Batman movie, then proceeding along its own course.
The movie is, of course, not for everyone.  If all you want to see are fists hitting the bad guys in the gut, you'll be disappointed (or perhaps, your kids will be).  There is romance, sorrow, and introspection, in addition to the violence of Batman's confrontation with villains.  This is simply a far more thoughtful movie than one might expect, and though it is well-done in this regard, it may not be what you are expecting.",973468800,90,1078,4.85792349726776
551338,5,6303058957,"Batman:MOTP is hands down the best comic-book/superhero adaptation ever; live-action or animated. It is better than Tim Burton's classic 1989 feature and any other comic based adventure to grace the small and big screen.
The irony in this is that this series, if you want to admit it or not, was an animated spin-off of the then successful live-action movie series. This movie became a spin-off of the hit Fox series and now it is probably the best interpretation of the character to date.
In the movie, a mysterious killer is knocking off gangsters and Batman is taking the blame. Meanwhile a former love interest of Bruce Wayne returns after suddenly skiping town several years later leaving then husband-to-be Bruce heartbroken. And to make matters more interesting, the Joker devilishly starts to cause trouble. Above all these fun and games is the love story which drives the story. It's an exploration of the loneliness in the life of the main character.
Mask of the Phantasm to me is what Tim Burton's first feature could have been. Beware that the origin of the Joker in this movie also assumes the Jack Napier/organised crime beginning.  The animation, though not Disney quality, works well with a terrific screenplay. What I liked about the movie was the role fate or destiny plays in the life of Bruce Wayne. Fans of Frank Miller's Batman:Year One should be pleasantly suprised by an action sequence involving the caped crusader against a swat team.

Batman's alter ego is as central to the story as his crimefighting persona, and by stripping away the extras (Robin, Batgirl, etc) this move succeeds at showcasing Bruce Wayne. You'll see a human behind the mask, which makes his vigilante actvities much more incredible. Gone are Burton's scenes of Batman killing/maiming/allowing crooks to die, and schumachers corny zooms and gimmicks are replaced by solid storytelling.  While the identidy of the Phantasm may not come as a great suprise, it will be an enjoyable ride.

The movie isn't bad. A new masked figure, looking somewhat like the reaper in Batman:  Year One, is killing of gangsters in Gotham. At the same time Bruce Waynes  old girlfriend arrives. When the gangsters asks help from the Joker,  everything starts to happen at once. Interesting thing is that the Jokers  origin story seems more based on the Nack Nicholson Batman-story (with  Joker as a gangster before, well, himself) rather than the one in the comic  books, as best told in The Killing Joke.
This film is quite brutal with  some very scary scenes. The Joker is at his worst, like a madly laughing  clown from hell. This is why I wouldn't recommend this movie for small  children, at least not without their parents. People that say Comics are  for children don't know the half of it.

The film is notable for Kevin Conroy and Dana  Delaney's excellent voice work, for the vision of an art deco Gotham  World's Fair, and for a Joker - without Harley Quinn to make him less  uncontrolled - at his most maniacal.

It's also more  violent than the Animated Series on television, showing cuts, scrapes, and  even a tooth that gets knocked out! The Joker is the insane, homicidal  villain he is in the comics and actually kills people in this show, as does  the Phantasm.  We even get a brief look at what the Joker was before he was  the Joker.

But Batman managed to pull it off. Then  there was the movie. Mask of the Phantasm.  Amazing? Not really. Arguably  impressive as it was, it did unfortunately lack the punch that certain  episodes such as ""Almost Got 'Im"" and ""Heart Of Ice""  contained.  I believe what disappointed most fans of this film was the  focus on a love story rather than a movie of what we'd truly come to expect  from Batman - action. I myself am a fan of the series. As for the movie, I  know that while it's just one of those titles you ""must have"" in  your collection, it isn't what someone who hasn't seen it would expect.  Definitely a great movie for kids but fans will want to stick to the show.",945734400,9,1279,4.48695652173913
551429,5,6303058957,"When I was younger, I used to brush off Batman: The Animated Series as stupid, and for little kids.  Now at the age of seventeen, I see that I was gravely mistaken.  Batman: Mask of the Phantasm would have to be my  favorite movie of all time.  How can I even begin to count all the things I  love about it?  It's gripping, exciting, witty, funny, sad...  Needless to  say, it's head over heals over any other Batman movie I've ever seen  before.  Unlike the live-action movies, it's not about appealing to the  audience with predictable James Bond action sequences and famous actors.  This movie truely does justice to the comic and to Bob Kane.  Each  character is portrayed perfectly, with wonderful animation and amazing  voice acting.  I absolutely love the dark deco art style as well.  And the  plot is one of the best I've seen.  It really keeps you interested.  I'd  recommend this movie to anyone, Batman fan or not!  Definately try this one  out!",941760000,43,957,4.598802395209581
551430,4,6303058957,"I thought this movie was very well made, much better than the live-action movies in my opinion. If you like Batman or the animated series, you will love this. However, one remark about the person who said this was the first  PG animated movie released theatrically. Sorry, though only one pops into  my mind, THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (though only one video release has  kept its theatrical rating of PG) was rated PG. I do not know if it was the  first or not, but that is what it was rated. Robotech the Movie did as  well, but I think it was like only released in one theater =) No others  stand out in my mind immediately though. Anyway, off the subject there,  Batman: MOTP, go buy, watch, enjoy.",941500800,,703,4.403100775193798

7836201,5,6303058957,"Loved this movie for years - there is a reason its developed such a cult following. the animation is from the iconic Batman TAS era, and the storyline is suspenseful and engaging. A must see for all batman fans of all ages. And I don't want to give too much away, but I'll just add that there is a strong female lead",1524268800,,316,4.112903225806452
7836202,5,6303058957,Still the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight trilogy comes close but this one beats those by staying true to each previous installment of Batman and by having an actual mystery aspect to it. Mark Hamill will always be the true Joker.,1524096000,,233,4.571428571428571
