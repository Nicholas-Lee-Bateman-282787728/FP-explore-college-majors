If you like to watch pretty girls beat up on men, you might get a bit of enjoyment out of this film.

There are numerous scenes of female ex-commandos beating the crap out of bad guys throughout the movie, but honestly most of them are poorly choreographed and shot and look pretty fake and silly. Still, if you are into that kind of thing there is some decent fighting that you may enjoy.

The movie's story is completely forgettable and boring. It's a by-the-numbers story of our main heroine going off to avenge her sister's death, with a very clich&eacute; group of bad guys dumping toxic waste illegally or something. They attempt to throw in a plot twist towards the end, but overall it is just a lazy effort. The characters are not believable or relatable, the acting and dialogue is painfully bad, and the story is clich&eacute;d and ridiculous.",1379462400,,871,4.717105263157895

That the late great Mickey Rooney would involve himself in a project like this shocks me... to say nothing of another great, Frank Gorshin.

The plot was paper thin and there was absolutely no suspense in the movie. The only thread that remotely interested me was which side Marc Singer was on. This was decided in the movie's climax, yet even that was dealt with insufficiently. Amazon is selling this for $50.00 new. I wouldn't buy it for half that price!! It is that horrible!

It's a sort of a female magnificent seven and stars Finn Carter, whom I am not much of a fan of I have to say, but the film was worth getting for everything else.
It was another of those rare dvds that cost a small fortune to order and to ship to the UK, but I have usually found them to be bettr than most of what's on offer now.  I am something of a small collector of rare films anyway.  It was a fun film from start to finish and features a few pretty well known guest stars, such as Katherine Kilmont, and there's obviously some female butt kicking, mostly from Finn, who gets to throw her legs around a bit, and put some guys into the dust, which also gives us some nice shots of her butt in jeans, but there's no anti male or feminist attitudes going on here I'm glad to say.  I would have found that annoying.  They just go with the story and do what they have to do and there's also a twist at the end which I didn't see coming.  All in all a pretty decent all girl revenge flick and worth the small fortune I paid for it.  Yes, there's also some nice flesh in there too from some of the ladies in this, alas not from Finn, which I am not too impressed by, but everyone else shows off some nice flesh, but none of it makes it a cheap exploitation film.  Just because a film has sex and some nudity, doesn't mean it should fall into that category.
Another point of note is that Marc Singer, (V, The Beastmaster), turns up too and it was nice to see him in something totally different.",1311206400,,1608,4.0504731861198735
7912908,2,B00000JNTU,"Sonny Justice returns to her home town after her sister's suspicious death. Seems her sister was involved in some local corruption and wanted out when things got heavy. Leading to her partners to have her killed. Sonny puts together her former female fighting team from the military to avenge her sister's death, when the local authories seem to ignore what is going on. Sweet Justice is a simply average action flick, not horrible but not worth spending money to watch either. The cast includes: Finn Carter (Tremors), Marc Singer (The Beastmaster, Body Chemistry), and Kathleen Kinmont (Halloween 4, Fraternity Vacation).",1307404800,,623,5.24
