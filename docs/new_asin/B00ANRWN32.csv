So when you look at different balance sheets on different companies, you will understand how to read it and how it helps you in knowing whether to invest in a company.

8554875,5,B00ANRWN32,"This is a pretty good DVD that teaches you about how to read and understand the balance sheet. He discusses individual sections: assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Within these individual sections, he discusses individual items, what they mean, and why they are there.

This is definitely a useful video. However, I am not sure if I would get it alone without getting all of the other DVDs because they go together.",1355702400,,427,5.014084507042254
8554876,5,B00ANRWN32,"This video teaches you how to read the balance sheet. First, he talks about how the balance sheet is structured, and then, he goes into the details of each section of the balance sheet, discussing individual items that are listed on the balance sheet. I wanted to watch this video to enable me to make the leap from the Accounting world to the Investing world.  Most of what people learn about Accounting in school is not related to how that information could be used in investing decisions.  It's about time somebody fills in the gap!",1355443200,,535,4.621052631578947
