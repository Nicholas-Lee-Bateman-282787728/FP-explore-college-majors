5448883,5,B00ALMNCLQ,"I just finished watching Madly Madagascar on DVD and LOVED it.

What is not to love about these guys. We know them now after what, 3 movies now. Marty, Alex, Melmon and Gloria and the rest of the animals are back again and this time it is Valentine's Day.

Alex the beloved Lion from the zoo loves Valentine's Day and why not? At the zoo, he was treated like royalty.  He starts telling the animals about Valentines and how to make them so he can put them on his Valentine tree when he is interrupted by word of King Julian's Love Potion.

The animals flock to find out what it is all about and eventually everyone wants a shot of it so they can become irresistible.  Marty wants in because there is a stunning new Opaki in town and everyone is trying to catch her eye. Will the Love Potion #9 that fell from the sky be the answer? I won't tell ya but it it a great movie. Only about a half hour long. My favorites scenes are with the penguins more specifically Skipper and his bobble head wife.

Adorable movie for kids and the adults",1359676800,5,1035,4.228426395939087
5448884,5,B00ALMNCLQ,"If you love the Madagascar characters you will love this DVD, as it brings them back together for some brand new fun. My kids are big fans of the movies and thus they were excited to see this as well. In watching this you will definitely laugh and have a great time as a family spending time together. My favorite character by far is King Julien... but that's just me! The movie was enjoyable and you will be engrossed in it from beginning to end! It is short, and not as long as the movies, but in my perspective still a lot of fun for the fan!

5448916,5,B00ALMNCLQ,"My goddaughter loves this movie. It's a spin-off from the madagascar series and it's great. The characters voices are different, but the kids won't tell the difference. I loved it too. Great Price",1392854400,,196,4.96969696969697

5448922,3,B00ALMNCLQ,It's a holiday special spin off so it's about what you can expect.  It's kooky but my two year old daughter loves.  Plus it's hard to find a holiday special for Valentine's day.  One thing I do love about it is the nod to a lesser known movie call The Gods Must Be Crazy.  Love the fact that someone else out there has seen it and loved that movie too.  Kudos Dreamworks team,1381449600,,375,4.082191780821918

5448925,5,B00ALMNCLQ,For my little ones and I know they will enjoy it every time they watch the movie at my home.,1376179200,,92,3.65
5448926,3,B00ALMNCLQ,This movie is OK- it's not as good as some of the reviews suggest- especially compared to the 3rd (Europe's Most Wanted) or any of the 'Penguins of Madagascar' series- I guess I'm just jaded or spoiled.,1376092800,2,202,4.486486486486487

5448931,3,B00ALMNCLQ,"This was really cute but could have been improved with another 10-12 minutes of running time.

The price was quite cheap - $5.99. But even so this would have been better being longer.

I would rate this 6.5 to 7.0 out of 10 on my scale. I hope they make a 4th 'Madagascar' movie as the first 3 have ranged from very good to great!. My friends in the industry tell me a 4th episode is likely for mid 2015. On a related note I've been told another 'Toy Story' is likely and is in story development now.

On Amazon's 5 point scale this is a 2.75 to 3.0 out of 5.",1373068800,2,559,3.9732142857142856

5448935,5,B00ALMNCLQ,"My 3 year old got this for Valentine's Day and we had to watch it 10 times the first day.  GRRRRR....super cute movie though and I don't mind watching it at all.  I wish it were longer, but it works for a quick car ride.",1367798400,,220,3.8666666666666667

5448940,1,B00ALMNCLQ,"I know I missed it in the details of this movie, my fault, but this so called movie is only 22 minutes long, I put it in for my 5 year old grandson while he ate lunch and it was over before he finished.

5448942,3,B00ALMNCLQ,King Julien gets his hands on a love potion and this brings out his romantic snakeoily sensibility.  Alex stands as the voice of reason while Melman frets (who'da saw that coming?) over Gloria's supposed love a'waning while Marty finds that more than one's a crowd.  It's all nice fluff but nothing to get choked up about.,1364256000,2,322,4.732142857142857

5448944,1,B00ALMNCLQ,"This appears deceptively to be Madagascar 1, appearing alongside Madagascar 2 and 3. In fact, Amazon does not offer Madagascar 1, (don't know why) but instead this stupid compilation of Madagascar meets Santa and other side stories. Save your money.",1363996800,2,249,5.25
5448945,5,B00ALMNCLQ,WOW!!! Anything with Madagascar is AWESOME!!! This is one of those movies that is ONLY 30 minutes long (24 minutes to be exact) but it adds to the enjoyment of the entire saga of Madagascar that I proudly own. A must have for anybody who has the saga of Madagascar like I do ;-),1363910400,,278,4.166666666666667
5448946,4,B00ALMNCLQ,"Paid like $5 for this dvd, I think it is only 25 min's long or so but its nice to see the Madagascar characters on these holiday special dvd's.  If you're a fan of the 3 movies, you'll like this one as well. It's a fun Valentines movie to watch, we let my daughter watch it before she went to bed on Valentines and she enjoyed it so I was happy.  Again, for $5, you can't go wrong.",1363824000,,381,3.871794871794872

8553344,5,B00ALMNCLQ,"It's only 22 minutes long, but they are a really good 22 minutes! I was surprised with the animation quality being almost on par with the movie. King Julien is a more central character in this short film, which is a nice change of pace as I feel he isn't given enough screen time in the films.
Good that shouldn't disappoint if you like the Madagascar series.",1506988800,,359,4.373134328358209
