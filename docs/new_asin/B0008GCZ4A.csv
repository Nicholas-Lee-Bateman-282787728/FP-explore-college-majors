There are some head scratchers that make you shout, ""Oh, yeah!"" when you finally find out the answer, and then there are the few that everyone will know without too much brain strain.

The only drawback on this video is the extrememly cheese-covered sound track. The manufacturer even recommends that you mute the sound and use your own music or scary sounds for setting a mood because this monotonous loop of sound is dreadful after the first ten minutes or so. That being said, the game itself is fun and educational! We had a blast playing it, and it's a perfect Halloween party game.",1256342400,,716,4.59375
8056193,3,B0008GCZ4A,"Judging from the cover shown in this listing, this is the same product as ""Drew's Famous Halloween Trivia Party.""  The TV screen in the product picture above is the same as you'll see on Drew's DVD of the same name (which I have).

Drew's product features a trivia game with questions that are challenging enough, filled with fun facts as well as pop culture and film references -- but the same short music selections repeat annoyingly, and the game itself seems to be nothing more than a simple Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that any intermediate PowerPoint user could have created.  It has inspired me to think about about creating my own presentations for other theme parties.

You can play this as an active parlor game, using your DVD's remote control to pause the screen as each question appears while opponents or teams compete for points, or you can program your DVD player to repeat and just let it spin while your guests wander by.  It's an effective conversation piece, if a bit unimaginative in the visuals department.  You'll probably want to show this DVD with the audio turned off, prefering instead to supply your own sound effects or music, so as to avoid having to listen to so much musical repetition.

The ethereal smokey animated background is effective, but a more-varied audio accompaniment would have brought this product up a notch or two.

By the way, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" fans will be horrified to see the question: ""In the film 'To Kill A Mockingbird,' what costume is Scout wearing when he is walking through the woods?""  (1) Scout is not a ""he.""  (2) Scout is not walking through the woods; she and her brother are walking home from a school pageant at night in their neighborhood.",1238112000,,1718,4.773648648648648
8056194,3,B0008GCZ4A,"I thought that this would be fun for an office party - only to find out that a couple of the questions were ""R"" rated.  I never thought that I would have to preview it first.  Fun, but...",1167955200,,187,3.8947368421052633
8056195,5,B0008GCZ4A,"Fun, challenging, entertaining video that the entire family enjoyed.  Looking forward to showing it at our upcoming annual Halloween party.  Some questions were easy and others were extremely tough which made it a challenge for us all.  Looking forward to the next holiday one...........",1127692800,,287,5.4772727272727275
8056196,5,B0008GCZ4A,"This dvd trivia game is well done and FUN, a great addition to our Halloween. We found the questions perfect for Halloween, we love it adds a another twist to our halloween party, I reccomend it highly for people who love to party at Halloween, there are questions for everyone in it.",1126915200,,284,4.480769230769231
