7667384,5,B01BTDOSTK,"This biopic concerns Olympic Champion Jesse Owens and several situations that occur to understand him while there - along with showing some of his personal life. Race, with its multifaceted title written by Joe Shrapnel alongside Anna Waterhouse and directed by Stephen Hopkins (The Ghost and the Darkness), gives us Stephan James as a determined and approaching Olympic Gold medalist, Jesse Owens. His actual name is James Cleveland Owens, or nicknamed, J.C. Originally from Alabama, he had a very thick accent at the time which caused others to combine the J and the C of his name's first initials together often and his name soon becomes mispronounced as Jesse.  He soon went by and first captured an enormous speed and accuracy during his life in the following track and field events; the 100 meters, the 200 meters, the 400-meter relay, along with his record-shattering long jump. His furthest length stood alone as the record for twenty-five years. These unprecedented feats were accomplished in their fullest during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany. He broke two Olympic records during that 'significant' years events; 20.7 seconds in the 200 meters and 25 and 8  in the long jump. This extraordinary athlete and devoted competitor brought home four Gold Medals for the United States of America and ran circles around his adversaries which included Hitlers vision of his own prized Aryan supremacy.

The current year is 2016 and intriguingly enough it is the Eightieth Anniversary of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. It immediately brought to my mind just how deplorable it must have been to face the fascist regime of the Nazis out in full force.  Hitler was present holding onto his nausea-inducing ideas about the superiority of his own grandiose beliefs. We also have Paul Joseph Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat) who was the Third Reichs Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1933-1945. One of Hitlers most valued associates and a personally devoted assistant known for his persuasive, influential public speaking. His virulent anti-Semitism which easily led to his advocacy of the extermination of the Jewish people during the Holocaust. Now we have this person who was personally appointed emissary to have the complete and independent power to take any action he deemed necessary (Just some information about how completely evil Goebbels was). Along with this storyline was the propagandist film director, Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten  Black Butterflies, Valkyrie), who somewhat shares, but possibly snubs, a Goebbels which I will leave within the storyline. Some of these subplots do not need any further explanation in a review but to experience them within the film of Owens ambitions and excellence. I can say that Riefenstahl is a much more sympathetic character than even Goebbels may have first thought... and possibly the rest of us too.

The shouted ""Sieg heil"" to a waving Hitler in the crown reveals the evil-intentioned Nazi regime along with the visuals of swastikas; the symbols of hatred and intolerance. It does become known further in the film what is to become of the decorated site for these particular Olympic Games. What Jesse Owens faced as far as the racism was as with any African-American man at these Olympic Games. They were to be boycotted because of the intolerance engulfing the Nazi society, and what was soon to come for him. This became a sort of history lesson told more so from the vantage point of Jesse Owens. Race could have fallen flat on the track with so many different people of interest being focused on along with coinciding subplots although I really enjoyed it even if the story may not be entirely accurate concerning each and every situation. It may get a bit heavy-handed in these directions for some with all the aforementioned people, and there are many, included here in the story. I think that this story of the incredible athlete, Jesse Owens, deserves to be acknowledged and his amazing story begged to be introduced

Although the climate in the United States was terribly racially discriminative and equally unwelcoming, while brutal segregation becomes more rampant. The all-out champion and winning athlete, Olympic suited Owens still had to enter through the back doors and sit at the back of any bus. Owens held himself to a standard of respectability while our own President did not acknowledge his Olympic accomplishments for the U.S. This was the atmosphere Owens became acquainted with right from his home country. Beginning in his earlier college days, Owens is being successfully coached by a once down-on-his-luck, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis in an evenhanded dramatic role) at The Ohio State where he was nicknamed The Buckeye Bullet as, within the span of an extremely short and fly by quickly forty-five minutes, he immediately bested three records and tied a fourth. Snyder was one of very few who allowed African Americans to run track for Ohio State in comparison to other schools so he could see the potential of his charge along with wishing to take part in the Berlin Games. He taught Owens to block out the crowd completely and keep his focus on the race. There is a problem though as a boycott is being seriously considered because the Jewish and African American people are banned from competing. Owens changes his mind about going to the Olympics even if to face the discrimination of the rule of Germanys prewar Nazis He was not going to be intimidated as he was far too talented and inspired.

The organizers of the Olympic Games in much smaller roles, Avery Brundage (Jeremy Irons) and Jeremiah Mahoney (William Hurt) adamantly challenge the ridiculous ban and America will threaten the German discriminatory ruling to participate in the upcoming Games. Even though, will they be challenging Germanys ruling and possibly a change in setting? We see Jesse Owens, his former accomplishments with Snyder, and find him questioning his own home country as far as being accepted. Why is it that our own President cannot acknowledge his loyalty, his overall spectacular participation during such an important time in history through Owens; this brave man willing to take on the patriotic duty he feels to win for our own country? As I said earlier, the film is very much like a history lesson which does deal with a whole lot of heavier content; so much so that I would really like to watch this over again. The first view actually shows us a great time in our history and how the Nazi party had to actually make exceptions. That was something which is not done with enthusiasm and I couldn't help but feel good about any new details I was learning. At times, I genuinely felt that our amazing athlete, Jesse Owens, was a man without a country because of the times which didn't say much about our country as a whole. A great film to watch with your family. A true story with a PG-13 rating which I found was inspirational as much as I found it insightful concerning the dichotomy of its own title Race. With some misgivings, it still taught lessons about how people are despicably treated and offers a lesson of that particular era I sicken (like most all) just' thinking of, but its truth will never stop being a much needed constant reminder. ""Race"" proves this over and over again.",1463961600,12,7296,4.96969696969697
7667385,3,B01BTDOSTK,"How unrivaled was Olympic legend Jesse Owens at the height of his career? Owens won four gold medals in the controversial 1936 Berlin Olympics overseen by Adolf Hitler, when he was there only to compete in three events; that's how good he was. But Owens' track and field resume is only a part of his tremendous story. ""Race"" is the perfect title for Stephen Hopkins' crowd-pleasing introduction to Owens' story, as it signifies both his athletic gifts and the overwhelming social hurdles he had to overcome to achieve such greatness.

""Race"" is a lot like last year's Jackie Robinson drama, ""42"", in that it takes a fairly simple approach to a difficult personal struggle. That doesn't mean the film is without power or significance; quite the contrary, actually. Owens' story is one of the first great precursors to the upcoming civil rights movement, but it's also the story of a man called upon to represent a country that hates him for the color of his skin. Played with great skill by the impressive Stephan James, Owens overcomes economic hardship in Depression-era America to attend Ohio State as part of the track & field team. Immediately he's faced with prejudice from every direction, from his teammates and even the faculty. When approached by team coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis), Owens must convince him he's not just another lazy black guy. He most certainly isn't, working multiple jobs to support his girlfriend and child in-between taking classes. Owens' talent on the field shocks and amazes everyone, though, and it's enough to get him the kind of leniency reserved for only the most special athletes.

The unusual (for the time) friendship between Snyder and Owens is the story's beating heart. Snyder, who had been in a slump until Owens showed up, takes the young athlete under his wing and helps build him into a man worthy of being an Olympian. While painted in broad strokes, the relationship between the two is a thorny one socially. Snyder's dealing with his own failures as a former track legend turned drunken hack, and doesn't understand why someone of Owens' gifts would ever consider not going to the Olympics. But that's what he's faced with when Owens is approached by the NAACP to boycott the games out of protest, not only of Hitler but of America's continued racism. The best moments in the film are between Snyder and Owens, as they slowly learn to accept the other as a friend, something which doesn't come easy to either.

Less convincing are the parallel stories running alongside Owens' like a competitor in the hurdles. In an effort to chronicle the Third Reich's athletic triumph, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (Carice Van Houten) set out to direct the legendary documentary, ""Olympia"". As depicted in the film she's pretty much unconcerned about Nazi ideology; she just wants to make a great movie. History doesn't tell us any of this is true, and the film takes some awkward detours to paint her as being something of an Owens fan. And then there's Jeremy Irons as ethically-compromised International Olympics Committee chair, Avery Brundage, who negotiated business deals with the Nazis and did everything he could to quietly undermine black and Jewish competitors. These are complicated characters and ""Race"" does not do complicated. Even Owens' transgressions, such as an extramarital affair that became a public scandal, are papered over faster than the sprinter's best time.

But digging into Owens' personal demons isn't what ""Race"" is setting out to be. It's a film about his heroic accomplishments in a time when people like him weren't thought to be heroes. As the film would later show, all of Owens' medals didn't change every mind about him. He still had to enter restaurants through the back entrance, even when attending a celebration in his honor. But he did manage to reach some people, and ""Race"" is a solid enough intro to Owens' life that it could inspire greater research into the full extent of his impact.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Race/dp/B01BTDOSTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Race</a>",1463788800,3,4099,5.113432835820896
7667386,2,B01BTDOSTK,"Great acting just not truthful, Hitler did not snub Jesse Owens it happened the day before with another athlete, Rosenfelt used Jesse for propaganda to propagate hate against National Socialist Germany............Jesse was a hero in Berlin ""superstar"" and treated as a second class Negro in the United States......just who was racist in 1936?.............. Adolph Dassler  ""adidis""  played a very small part, he pleaded with Jesse to wear his shoes (made Adidas a wealthy man and Jesse got nothing) if you are going to touch a delicate subject like this tell the truth in detail....., Jesse was rumored to have a picture of him shaking hands with Hitler it was in the movie............and Jesse got nothing from the president so sad..............Rosenfelt was the original spelling of Roosevelt.............can you imagine having the key to the city of Berlin being able to go anywhere and Germans asking for autographs to going to New York City and having to take the freight elevator because you are black",1463702400,10,1007,5.171779141104294
7667387,4,B01BTDOSTK,"This is the Jesse Owens (Stephen James) story starting in Cleveland as he bids farewell to his baby mamma and child as he heads off to Ohio State. It ends in Berlin.

What I enjoyed best was Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten) who was instructed by Hitler to film the 1936 Olympics and did so in spite of Herr Gobbels (Barnaby Metschurat). While the film has the expected feel good chest swell due to the subject matter, I never was able to connect to the main character. While some say Stephan James ""nailed it"" and that may be true, I didn't feel all the issues he had to face, perhaps because he was accepted them quietly  and timing his outbursts.

No swearing sex, or nudity. Did people use ""hell"" on the radio, and did they say ""good luck with that?""  BTW Germany got the most medals in the 1936 Olympics.",1461542400,,812,4.3933333333333335

7667389,4,B01BTDOSTK,I really enjoyed this movie. It's exciting and features a heartfelt performance by Stephen James as Jessie Owens. To think Jesse Owens almost boycotted the 1936 Olympics! I also really liked the fact they went back to the actual arena that the 1936 Olympics took place in to film the movie. It definitely added authenticity. 4 1/2  stars,1457913600,2,337,4.810344827586207
7667390,4,B01BTDOSTK,"A very decent but pretty standard feel good biopic on Jesse Owens and his magnificent appearance at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, one of the greatest individual sports performances of all time. Stephan James turns in a very solid and likeable performance as Jesse Owens, who overcame plenty of obstacles as a black athlete just to get into college sport in the 30's, much less the Olympics. Of course, he was hardly the only black US athlete there, just overwhelmingly the most prominent, which the audience gets very little sense of.  We get a reasonable idea the racial issues Owens dealt with getting to the Olympics, but nothing too overwhelming for the viewer. Even more interesting was the fact that the NAACP wanted him to stay out of the games with the fact that Owens seems not to have known initially who theywere.

All of the supporting roles are well done, except perhaps the fellow they chose to play Joseph Goebbels.  Jeremy Irons plays Avery Brundage who was instrumental in keeping the US in the games.  Irons, is of course a great actor and always fun to watch and he dominates his scenes, if not the film entirely. But Brundage seems to have worked very closely indeed with Nazi officials to keep the US in the games, not entirely out of altruism and remained controversial throughout his long career of heading the U.S. Olympic Commitee.

Owens' life after the games was no bowl of cherries either, which we get a limited sense of as well as this is primarily relegated to a brief written summary at the end of the film. At least one book indicates Owens was far more angry with FDR for not recoginizing his achievements after the games than he was with Hitler for not shaking his hand during the games..

However, the film does a fine job of honoring Jesse Owens memory and Stephan James is definitely worth watching in his portrayal of this American athletic icon.",1457308800,4,1884,4.676737160120846
7667391,4,B01BTDOSTK,"The Good:
Stephan James portrays Jesse Owens as accurately as one could imagine. Jason Sudeikis, who plays Owens' coach Larry Snyder, also compliments James in a supporting role that doesn't threaten to overshadow the main character. Surprisingly, Jeremy Irons' character almost stole the lead supporting character role with his performance as Avery Brundage.

The film's biggest highlight is the context it provides to the historical events of the Berlin Olympic games. It portrays the Nazi regime as the overly blatant villains throughout the film. Beyond that the movie consistently reminds you of the racial tensions of the 1930's and how it transcended to even beyond the United States.

The Bad:
The movie seemed very simple and basic. There weren't any real highs or lows that will move you in any type of way. We sort of already know the ending with Owens' famous accomplishment; however the movie didn't quite build up the momentum or suspense that we would normally get in a sports bio-film.

The Reason:
Race was overall a heart warming film with the harsh reminder that our country, or the world, is still not as far removed from racial division as many would imagine. Rather than highlighting how great of an athlete Jesse Owens was, I think this film served a far greater purpose in demonstrating the historical context that many people probably were unaware of surrounding the Berlin Olympics. The irony of it all is that Owens' accomplishments were neglected and not formally recognized for over three decades; and I suspect that this film will also be neglected and forgotten in a similar sense. This wasn't as good as other African American bio pics like 42 (Jackie Robinson story) or Ray (Ray Charles).
I suppose this is the ""Black History Movie-of-the-Month"" so it's worth watching in the least. It's not bad, it's not great, it's a good movie at the end of the day.

7667450,5,B01BTDOSTK,"I thought it was quite an entertaining movie, how much it was embellished like most of these based on true story/people are, I don't know. I imagine it's around the realism level of Eddie the Eagle, and it's that sort of uplifting type of overcoming obstacles type of film.  It did seem to be pretty mildly showing what it was like in Berlin in the lead up to the games, perhaps to try and get a kid friendly viewer movie.  The racism and discrimination also seemed like it would in reality have been a bit more brutal and hardcore, with the racist football team and that sort of thing.  I didn't even know Jason Sudeikis was in this,but have to say he did a pretty good job as the university coach, in a non his usual manchild humour type of role.  Stephan James as Jesse Owens plays a very likable character, he didn't seem to have any faults at all, which is hard to imagine the real life guy like anyone for that matter wouldn't.

But entertainment wise, this is a fairly enjoyable film.  You obviously know how it is going to turn out and for me it was a little too much time wasted on if he would go to Berlin or not, when we know he did.  Maybe less of that and a bit more of the aftermath years, instead of a text summary of what happened to the German champion.  I mean they told us with a photo he made it to old age, but what happened after Berlin in the years before he died?  Four and a half stars.",1487980800,,1411,4.13919413919414

While the #1 reviewer said that ""product knowledge"" is a problem with this, I don't see it as such.  Many years have elapsed and are now several generations removed from the original story and time.  So, many watching it now would be learning firsthand of both Owens and the ultimate race of the races.

7667522,5,B01BTDOSTK,"This true story of an American hero is written by Joel Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse and directed by Stephen Hopkins  a team that has managed to place before the public one of the finer biographies of a sports superstar as well as a powerful statement about racism in this country and abroad on the screen today. It is filled with excellent and sensitive performances in major and minor roles and the fact that it is not being considered for awards seems oddly uninformed.

The title of the film  RACE - is most appropriately chosen as it asks the audience to transpose concepts of sportsmanship to considerations of racial bigotry both of the past and the present. And that works very well indeed. Using the extremes of Nazi Germany extermination of Jews, Blacks, gypsies, gays etc in the name of Aryan supremacy is shudderingly demonstrated, but equally difficult is the manner in which the film places a mirror to America, both in the more blatant era of the 1930s (in schools, restaurants, and African American families) of the hurtful racism that still exists is so important for us to see enacted on the big screen.

Briefly, Jesse Owens' quest to become the greatest track and field athlete in history thrusts him onto the world stage of the 1936 Olympics, where he faces off against Adolf Hitler's vision of Aryan supremacy. But more specifically, in the 1930s, Jesse Owens (Stephan James in an Oscar worthy performance) is a young man who is the first in his family to go to college. Going to Ohio State to train under its track and field coach, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis, proving that he is a fine actor in a fine film instead of just another silly goofus as in his usual films), the young African American athlete quickly impresses with his tremendous potential that suggests Olympic material. However, as Owens struggles both with the obligations of his life and the virulent racism against him, the question of whether America would compete at all at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany is being debated vigorously. When the American envoy (Jeremy Irons) finds a compromise persuasive with the Third Reich to avert a boycott, Owens has his own moral struggle about going  not only the race issues but leaving behind his girlfriend (Shannon Banton) and their child. Upon resolving that issue, Owens and his coach travel to Berlin to participate in a competition that would mark Owens as the greatest of America's Olympians even as the German film director, Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten), locks horns with her country's Propaganda Minister, Josef Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat), to film the politically embarrassing fact for posterity.

There are many significant minor roles portrayed by William Hurt, Eli Goree, Jonathan Higgins, Shamier Anderson, and especially David Kross who plays Carl Luz Long  Jesses German rival with whom Jesse finds support and understanding in a very moving scene.

There are many reasons to see this film, or better yet town it to share with others. It is an outstanding achievement with a very important message. Grady Harp, December 16",1482105600,,3084,4.951644100580271

7667569,4,B01BTDOSTK,"Somewhat well-known story told here with fresh depth.  Straightforward comparison of the racist Nazi worldview to Jim Crow America is made loud and clear, and  shortens the distance between the good guys and bad guys in that war that followed close on the heels of those 1936 Olympic Games.
Viewing ""Race"" this week, though, several months after its original release, but while the 2016 US Presidential race is at its cringe-worthiest, I was particularly struck by the film's depiction of German efforts at dissent. Though a delicately drawn theme, there are depictions of individuals standing up to Hilter's solidification of his totalitarian grip over German values, which parallel Mindful America's discomfort at how to react to Trump erupting demagogy.
I was also struck by the problem presented to the individual who tries to remain true to ideology as they choose appropriate means of dissent.  Can you imagine what a blunder it would've been if Jesse Owens had followed the prevailing opinion at the time, to boycott the games to make a stand against German racism?  No one would know his name.  The story would go untold.
As a side note I mention that the film also left me with more interest than I started with, to learn more about the persons behind the historic reputations of Leni Rieffenstahl (filmmaker) and Joseph Goebels.",1477267200,2,1338,5.009009009009009

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

For those young people who know nothing about Jesse Owens, the star track and field athlete of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, ""Race"" fills in the basic facts about Owens' life at that time. Director Stephen Hopkins, working from a screenplay by Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, creates what amounts to a hagiography, starring a miscast Stephan James in the title role.

The problem with the whole project is that it only focuses on Owens' glory daysfirst preparing for the Olympics at Ohio State University under the tutelage of his college coach, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis has almost as much screen time as James in the role of Owens)and then moving on to his great victories at the Olympic Games.

Unfortunately, the Jesse Owens story AFTER his great accomplishments at the Olympics, is much more interesting than the story told here. Watching Race, one can only conclude that Owens' principal flaw was his weakness for other women. Owens' childhood sweetheart, Ruth, is the woman he eventually married. But once he became a big college track star, he was seduced by a society girl of sorts, Quincella, which caused a good deal of friction between him and his bride-to-be. They eventually reconcile, and Race's chronicle of the conflict between Jesse and Ruth is perhaps the most compelling part of the picture.

Stephan James unfortunately cannot get a handle on what Owens was like as a man, not only because of the limitations of the script but because James doesn't look or sound like the real Owens. Much more successful was Dorian Harewood as Jesse Owens in the 1984 TV mini-series entitled ""The Jesse Owens Story."" Harewood plays Owens as a much more easy-going good guy, sometimes nave and taken advantage of by others. James, on the other hand, exudes a much more modern sensibility, and sometimes comes off as a militant, irked by a racist society that won't acknowledge his accomplishments.

Unlike Race, The Jesse Owens story begins with a probation officer preparing a pre-sentence report on Owens during the late 60s, after he's charged with tax evasion. Instead of the proud militant who has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder, the real Jesse Owens was often labeled an ""Uncle Tom"" by other African- Americans for supposedly ""collaborating"" with the white power structure. There a scene in the 1984 mini-series where Owens is castigated by his own family for representing the International Olympic Committee (IOC) who asked him to extract an apology from the two black Olympians who raised their fists during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.

The 1984 series also goes into much more detail as to the racist encounters Owens had to endure throughout his life. And Avery Brundage, the head of the IOC, is not only portrayed as more of a racist than he's depicted in the current film, but Owens calls him out in a nicely acted scene in the mini-series.

There's much more about Owens that we don't get to see here but do find out about in the mini-series--and that's disappointing. There's the story about the paper bag full of $10,000 cash which was supposedly tossed into Owen's car as he rode in a ticker-tape parade in NYC after the Olympics. Harewood as Owens in the TV series admits that he got the cash from political operatives representing the 1936 Presidential candidate, Alf Landon. It's well known that Owens was basically a Republican for most of his life and resented the fact that President Roosevelt failed to congratulate him for winning the four gold medals at the Olympics.

More shocking vignettes including Owens agreeing to run against race horses down in Cuba after failing to secure a decent job to support his family. Owens was also forced to resign as a City Commissioner in Detroit after insinuations (later proved untrue) that he did some dirty work for Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters. Eventually Owens was able to convince the Probation Officer that he deserved a second chance, and he was only fined by the Federal Judge for charges of tax evasion. He went on to earn a living as a public speaker and died young at 67, from lung cancer (surprisingly Owens had a three pack a day cigarette habit).

Race manages to handle the actual track and field events at the Olympics more impressively than the less technically proficient scenes (filmed in black and white) in the 1984 mini-series. Owens' relationship with the German track star, Carl ""Luz"" Long, is done nicely in both the current film and the previous TV series, and other controversial subjects are covered in both--including the Nazis' propaganda campaign against the Jews (shut down before the games at the request of the IOC) and the dismissal of the two Jewish athletes in the 4x100 meter sprint relay (whom Owens and another black athlete replaced).

Race keeps things interesting by introducing Leni Riefensthal (of ""Triumph of the Will"" fame) who filmed the 1936 Olympics at the behest of Nazi propaganda minister, Josef Goebbels. Unfortunately here, Goebbels is played as a stock villain by Barnaby Metschurat.

If you know nothing about Jesse Owens, this film is a basic primer. As an athlete, Owens' accomplishments were extraordinary. But there's much more to his personality than depicted here. Why not watch ""The Jesse Owens Story""? You can find it on Youtube for free!",1474329600,2,5368,4.899779735682819

7667648,3,B01BTDOSTK,"This recent biopic about one of Americas greatest athletes, Jessie Owens focuses both on the big race, that being the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and on race, being a discrimination factor both in Germany and in The United States.  Owens, nicely portrayed by Stephan James (John Lewis in Selma) is about to enroll at Ohio State on a track scholarship.  He leaves his Cleveland home as well as his girlfriend Ruth (Shanice Banton in her big screen debut) and young daughter only to be greeted by racist footballers and coaches.  Fortunately track and field accepts black athletes and the coach, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis, Horrible Bosses) needs fast runners.

It turns out that Owens is the fastest of all, not only at Ohio State but in all of America and perhaps the world.  In 1935 and 1936, the Nazis are in full stride, amping up their purity of race agenda.  The Olympics would provide a world stage for Germanys predominance in everything from buildings to the success of the Aryan athletes.  During this section of the movie, the film diverts in 2 directions.  On one hand, the American Olympic Committee debates whether they should boycott the Olympics given Hitlers activities.  On the other, should American Negroes refuse to go?  The NAACP for example pleads with Jessie not to go, given Hitlers racist views.  Yet this is Jessies only chance to make a name for himself and help his young family.

The Olympic Committee sends Avery Brundage (Jeremy Irons, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) to negotiate with Hitler henchman, Joseph Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat) who agrees to allow the Americans to bring black and Jewish athletes under threat of an American boycott.  Another interesting subplot involves controversial German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten, The Fifth Estate) who documented the German rise and specifically the Olympics.  She was more interested in making a good film than adhering to Goebbels demands.  If this all sounds like it is taking away from the Jessie Owens story, yes it does.  Almost to the point that this give and take between the Nazis and the Americans is a movie by itself.

Suffice it to say, Owens stuck it to Hitler and the Nazis and returned to America as a hero.  But the treatment of African-Americans including Owens didn't change much.  The film wraps up years later when Jessie and Ruth along with Snyder and his new wife attend a formal dinner at a swank NYC hotel.  Jessie and Ruth are relegated to the kitchen entrance down an alley.  The biggest problem I had with the movie is that it follows the typical sports biopic checklist.  It is full of Hollywood clichs, which don't add much texture to the story or the characters.  Still, Owens is a familiar and important figure in American culture.  He might have been shortchanged a bit here.",1471824000,,2813,4.861344537815126

My cursory research shows that the film paid particular attention to representing the events, even if it encroached upon the desire to have a linear theme. It did not avidly portray a black-and-white image of good and evil (except for Hitler and his close associates) and does a good job of portraying those who were either conflicted or attempting to represent a greater good.",1471132800,,474,5.1558441558441555

7667671,5,B01BTDOSTK,"This is one of those rare movies that I have major script issues with, but loved anyway. The sense of immersion into the time period is incredible, for good and bad.

Slammed by a lot of critics, many of whom expected a sharper focus on Jesse Owens, RACE suffers exactly the same problems as most big-budget biopics  it's extremely difficult to boil a real person's life into a two-hour movie and maintain a sense of context and character that makes the story important. This was made especially with the backdrop of the 1936 Olympics, the rise of the Nazis, and the clouds of war swirling a half a world away through most of the story.

All the performances were great  I'd be shocked if Jason Sudikis doesn't get an Oscar nod for his poignant portrayal of coach Larry Snyder. After a career most known for screwball comedy and a tenure on Saturday Night Live, the level at which he executed this role was a total surprise. The script was very loving toward Snyder, and Sudikis brought the character to life almost flawlessly.

Likewise, Stephan James deserves an Oscar nod for his nuanced portrayal of Jesse Owens. One hardly gets the sense he's acting, his performance is wrought with such a palatable sense of angst. Unfortunately, James is too often out-shined by the more charismatic Sudikis, a result of the script far more than the actor's abilities. Yet there's an inescapable sense of authenticity in the performance, so much that it's almost a shock to see pictures of the real Jesse Owens at the end and realize that James is only an actor.

However, the real breakout performance of the film was delivered by Barnaby Metschurat, whose portrayal of Joseph Goebells was the most chilling on-screen villainy I've ever seen. Without uttering a word, Metschurat's first appearance on-screen conveyed a dark gravitas that instantly personified the evil of the Third Reich. Metschurat is able to suck all hope and joy from every scene he enters, often without speaking. This is a new standard for evil that will influence films like the upcoming Star Wars as well as more character-driven drama.

While the performances were stellar, the script does oscillate wildly between Owens' personal life, his athletic career, and the politics of bringing the Olympic Games to the heart of the most belligerent nation on earth. There's a notable second act sag, but the third act  the ending in particular  is an unsatisfying and abrupt affair. Perhaps this was intentional, echoing the struggles Jesse Owens endured throughout his life after the Olympics. Yet it leaves the film feeling unfinished, unsatisfied.

It is as if the story simply stops rather than ending. And that, more than anything, is this movie's true fault. We want our happy ending. We want to feel good after this journey.

Yet, RACE gives us no true sense of closure. It is as if the filmmakers want us to carry out experience outside the film, to think about the themes of racism and injustice and standing up to evil long after the credits roll. And that is why I think this movie is destined to become a classic.",1471046400,,3084,4.810964083175803

7667872,2,B01BTDOSTK,"I am a fan of Jesse Owens, and I was prepared to be thrilled. Yet this movie did not deliver. Quite frankly it was too superficial about the Owens Family and Jesse Owens. I appreciate the limitations of a feature film, but those limitations did not hold back Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and numerous other movies. It did not even rise to the level of Selma or Ray. I am not assailing the actors, it just seems as if the screen play was too thin. They did not want to deal with the realities of American life for Blacks, and they also quickly glossed of the realities of American life for the Jewish athletes that were scheduled to compete at that Olympiad. In contrast, the politics behind the Berlin Olympics received better depth than Owens's character though the matter here was also thin. In essence, this movie made Pearl Harbor (2001) seem like a masterpiece.",1468540800,2,874,4.608974358974359

7667889,5,B01BTDOSTK,"I watched this movie last night! Extremely well done, and so many layers to peel back in uncovering this story. It is the story of Jesse Owens and his quest for gold at the Olympics while fighting racism and athletic opposition. I am surprised/not surprised that this movie hasn't been alluded to more often in online racial discussions...unless I missed something There are several takeaways:

1. Prominent blacks of the time wanted to protest the games because of Hitler's literal racist policies. This reminded me of a post I had earlier that said that protests only succeed in speaking loudly about the issue while action gets it done. These leaders pressured Jesse to boycott as well. He didn't. He ran and obtained several record-breaking medals, gaining the respect of his German opposition--who acted in defiance of his country's policies with these overtures toward Jesse. Jesse's action--not boycotting--spoke much more loudly and secured respect.

2. After the Olympic games, Jesse was to attend a dinner in his honor, but he was not even allowed to walk in the front door of the hotel hosting the event. Yup. The 1930s! But did you know that Democrat President FDR even refused to invite him to the White House to honor his victories? A Republican, Jesse Owens (yes--a Republican) actively campaigned for the Republican running against FDR (Alf Landon, I believe). Interesting. Interesting, indeed!

3. The Jews on the US Olympic team were being coaxed to drop from the team--by the higher ups--in the relay competition in spite of the fact that they trained for years and had traveled with the team: this was to be their sole event. Jesse spoke up in favor or keeping them on. Jesse was bold in wanting to stick this to Hitler, and he refused to cower or bow.

4. Jesse's spirit was indomitable. His work, persistence, courage, and matter-of-factness of letting his race--color and competition--do his speaking for him are to be modeled. He did so without disrespecting the institutions that disrespected him. This way he drew attention to the issues, not to himself, keeping the spotlight squarely on the injustice in spite of his fame.

One of the best movies i'd seen all year! This deserves more play and should be entered into the discussion. I submit this evidence as exhibit A.",1468540800,6,2297,4.9404145077720205

7667914,5,B01BTDOSTK,This is an excellent film everyone should see it.  Each person appearing is multi-dimensional and well developed within the story line.  The handling of Nazi Germany just prior to WWII was smart and an exposure of how ridiculous Hitler and his henchman were in their narcissistic pursuit of being the master race when they were so inferior to the very people they sought to eliminate.

7667925,5,B01BTDOSTK,Well cast and well written screenplay.  It was very well done historically and that is important to me.

Also we are fighting the Nazi's couldn't be a better sports flick.  It is a story that a lot of us know, but with some more details that I am glad that they didn't skim over.  Also the Nazi's aren't the only villains, Jessie has to deal with racist coaches, fans, and even his own moral compass.  I felt that it did run a little long, it had a little too much melodrama, and while I liked and believed Jason Sudeikis, he seemed just a touch too young for the role.",1468108800,,595,4.230088495575221

7667933,2,B01BTDOSTK,"Use of typical subplot formulas found in docudramas to make palatable to a broad audience, especially with esoteric subjects like track and field, i.e. athlete discord; coach discord; coach w/issues; love interest conflict; outside pressures, and so on. I thought I was re-watching the same script from half dozen similar athletic movies. The problem is that it detracts from any chance of an honest portrayal, of authenticity. So much film time was spent on these distractions that very, very little time was devoted to giving a sense of Owens' hard work in training. An odd inconsistency was the coach teaching a new method of starts with head down and staying low for the first ten or so meters - something that was never done from that scene onward. Interesting subplot was on the German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl who should also show up in ""The Boys in the Boat"", if they ever finish it.",1467936000,2,893,4.8431372549019605

7668021,4,B01BTDOSTK,"Although this movie tends to be more matter of fact in its telling of the events surrounding Jesse Owens Olympic story, that doesnt make this story any less remarkable or entertaining.  The story does a nice job at portraying the issues of the 30s, including segregation and the rise of Hitlers Germany in the build up to World War 2.  Stephen James is very good as Jesse Owens and the supporting cast including Jason Sudeikis as Coach Snyder and Jeremy Irons as Avery Brundage.  Although a minor supporting role, I think Barnaby Metschurat was very good with his steely glare as Joseph Goebbels.  I do think the story does tend to lightly cover some areas of the story such as the controversy with the Olympic committee and really fails to cover any of the life of Owens after the Olympics.  The story is also slow moving at times and could have been a bit better paced.  It is a shame though that this story has taken so long to be told as this is an American sports hero story as good as any other.  As others have said, I agree that maybe this isn't the best sports biopic I have even seen, but it is a good one and worth watching.

7668401,4,B01BTDOSTK,"""Race"" is not a great bio-pic, but it is a pretty good one.  All of the performances are strong and it does a very good job of establishing the historical setting and context of 1930s America and Nazi Germany.  The sub-plot of the great German filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl and her filming the Berlin Games is interesting as is the subplot of the behind the scenes controversy as to whether the US should attend the games at all.  But it is the story of Jesse Owens and his battle with white prejudice, black pressures, and Nazi attitudes that is the main thrust of ""Race"".  What keeps it from being great is that it suffers from the problem of ""knowledge aforehand"".  It is difficult to build much suspense with a well known story.  But, that does not mean dull or boring.  It would be a great film to sit down and watch with your kids to open up discussions about race and prejudice.",1466121600,22,883,4.447204968944099

7668429,5,B01BTDOSTK,"plot: Black American Jessie Owens and his road to gold metals in Nazi Germany's 1936 Olympics.

Jessie Owens (BRILLIANT STEPHAN JAMES) is one of 10 children raised on poverty. His lives in Cleveland Ohio where is a gifted runner. He works several jobs and tries to go to college at the same time. His coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudekis) is both his mentor and friend. Owens is soon ""relearning"" how to run. He faces prejudice in every area of his life. Owens breaks 5 records including 2 world records at one event in 1935 and is soon being considered for the 1936 Olympics. As the drama of the US Olympic committee being involved in all decisions and deals with the Nazis on allowing Jews and Black Americans to compete in very racially divided and controlled Germany. Owens qualifies. Owens wins 4 gold medals....and returns a hero and considered the FASTEST man in the world. As Owens and his wife are given a banquet in his honor he is forced to use the back door of the hotel due to ""rules"" on how blacks were segregated and badly treated in America on his return. Great plot and fantastic acting by both Stephan James and Jason Sudeikis. based on real life events. Carise Van Houten is fun as Hitler's brilliant filmmaker Leni Reifenstahl. Jeremy Irons and William Hurt are part the Olympic Committee who decides if the USA will be participate. This bio is based with the cooperation of the Owen Sisters ...Jessie Owens daughters. Also watch the great EXTRAS of the Owens Sisters interviewed. Well done bio of the brilliant Owens who never received the recognition or financial rewards deserved due to his being black. 5 STARS~and for the record there is an actual photo of Adolph Hitler talking to Jesse Owens at the end of the movie which his daughters stated he carried in his Wallet all his life.",1466121600,,1805,4.658307210031348

7668595,3,B01BTDOSTK,"As a title for this film,""Race"" is perfect as it illustrates clearly a type of double entendre; one race referring to the sport the hero is an unparalleled master of and the other race referring to the hero's ethnicity.  The two meanings are fairly well woven together in the plot, if it is a bit choppy and simplistic.  Many Americans (like this reviewer) may not be aware of the shenanigans of Avery Brundage during his long stint as head of the US Olympic Committee and the IOC (if they are, in fact true) nor of the blindingly outrageous racism that followed Jesse Owens from cradle to grave in spite of his magnificent accomplishments.  As the film portrays his story, one would not have blamed him at all if he had refused to run for the US at these particular Olympics.  In fact a boycott of the '36 Olympics might have sent an even more powerful message to Hitler and his fascists.  The fact that Jesse Owens was willing to run for a country that seemed (in the movie) to be as racist as the host country is a tribute to the greatness of his character.  That he won in such a convincing way is a credit to his talent and training and, perhaps, a gloved slap in the face to Adolph Hitler - who obviously deserved much worse!
Heavy weight actor, Jeremy Irons and William Hurt bring some needed gravity to the story though Stephan James (Owens) and Jason Sudeikis (his coach) are fine.  The script is fairly simple.  It is a compelling story told fairly well, but not beautifully well.  Certain subplots make things interesting and the theme will (hopefully) wrap it's tentacles around your heart so as never to let go.",1465430400,5,1624,4.515358361774744

7668764,4,B01BTDOSTK,"Sports movies usually leave me cold. I'm not one to be easily swept up by tales of guys in shorts overcoming adversity.

But I have to admit to feeling more than a tinge of excitement during the closing minutes of Race, a remarkably well-made, rousing picture about Jesse Owens' many triumphs at the 1936 Olympics.

An African American track-and-field athlete who grew up in near-poverty in Alabama and Cleveland, Owens became a veritable sensation during his tenure at Ohio State University. By the time he had qualified for the Olympics, Owens has set so many speed records, the media had dubbed him the world's fastest man.

Owens' athletic achievements alone - he took home four gold medals in 1936 - establish him as a legend worthy of attention. What makes his story so much more poignant - and so much more tricky to tell - are the many thorny political and racial issues involved.

As a black man in 1930s America, Owens was subject to a grossly racist and unjust political, social, and economic system. But as an American representing democracy in 1936 Germany, he had to stand for equality, truth, and justice in the face of Hitler's deadly campaign against non-Aryan Germans.

In the case of this movie, the title Race is, at least, a triple entendre.

Happily, director Stephen Hopkins (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers) handles these pointed complexities with remarkable grace and economy of style. The film never lets us forget the reality of American racism, while at the same time allowing us to feel some pride in the larger political meaning of Owens' success in Berlin.

In one scene, Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels (Barnaby Metschurat) explains to a visitor from the U.S. Olympic Committee (Jeremy Irons) that he designed the games with one aim in mind: to prove to the world the supremacy of the Aryan race.

Owens is credited with single-handedly dismantling that myth.

Stephan James (Home Again) is superbly understated as Owens, a supremely gifted and confident young man who finds himself facing a series of new challenges when he becomes the first person from his family to attend college - a predominantly white college at that.

The film focuses on Owen's relationship with his coach, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis), who is determined early on that Owens is Olympian material. Race doesn't let itself be distracted from its mission - showing how Owens, the timid student, grew up in a few short years to become Owens the track star. That's a mixed blessing: We get shortchanged when it comes to Owens' relationship with his wife, Ruth (Shanice Banton), and his dealings with his fellow students. And the larger political issues of the time - whether America should protest Hitler's regime by boycotting the games - are presented somewhat hastily.

But the film delivers what it promises - an education and a thrill.",1465084800,,2860,4.925155925155925

It had a very similar feel to the movie 42 about Jackie Robinson. There in your face violence. Segregation and racism was historically and accurately portrayed.

There was no nudity or sexual content although you knew that those things did happen. They just didn't show it in the movie.

The movie in my opinion wasn't sugar coated. I enjoyed it very much and I'm glad it didn't focus a lot on Hitler and did show the behind the scenes conversations going on between the German Olympic Committee and the US Olympic Committee representatives.

The actors that played Mr. Owens and his coach did a great job and had a great chemistry.

7668805,4,B01BTDOSTK,"""A man has to present an image to the world."" Jesse Owens (James) is a college track star. His coach Larry Snyder (Sudeikis) pushes him to be the best he can be. Jesse pushes himself on and off the track to be the best person and athlete he can be. Everything is going as he wants, he becomes a record breaking collegiate  champion with his Olympic dream in his sights. The only thing stopping him is his conscience. With Olympic gold in his grasp Jesse must decide if he is willing to compete in Germany, as an African-American, with Hitler watching. This movie is in my wheelhouse. Not only is this a sports movie but its a true story as well. I knew the basics of the Owens story, but this movie goes deeper into the pressure put on him from both sides of the Nazi debate. Even knowing how the movie will turn out the drama was gripping enough to keep me interested and wondering how he got to where he was at. Sudeikis actually does a really good job in a non comedic role and is almost the perfect choice for the coach. This is a movie I cannot say enough about. I highly recommend this, and the use of the n-word is limited so this is OK for family viewing as well. Overall, a sports movie that once again shows the triumph of the human spirit and how everyone is equal when the gun goes off. I give this an A-.",1464998400,,1317,4.18503937007874
