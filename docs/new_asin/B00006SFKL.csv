IT HAS REALLY CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND THE STORY IS WELL NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH "" SCARFACE "" "" GOODFELLAS"" "" GOD FATHER "" TRAFFIC "" CARLITOS WAY "" BLOW "" 21 GRAMS "" TRAINING DAY ""  JUST TO SAME A FEW.",1125446400,3,327,3.5277777777777777
1793850,4,B00006SFKL,"AT first I thought this movie was going to be stupid by the way it began, but after, I felt like it was a great reality movie with issues that Mexican Americans face everyday due to ignorant people who believe ""Mexicans"" should go back to Mexico blah blah blah.  Anyway, no not all Mexicans are in gangs like evryone thinks and there are all different races when it comes to gangs.  To some of the people that reviewed this movie and thought it was funny, I just think they are ignorant.  If you go back into history, you will realize that most of the United States used to be Mexico and that everyone is an immigrant unless you are a Native AMericAN Indian.  People who came from Europe were immigrants and most of the people who live here ( their grandparents, great-grandparents, etc) arrived here on the Mayflower or Ellis Island as well so I see no reason for anyone to feel like they are better than anyone else just because they are considered ""white"".  Everyone was an immigrant at some time or another.  Don't get me wrong, I get along with all races and realize not everyone is racist or discriminates.  I give this movie four stars just because some of the actors weren't so good.  This movie shows the struggle of hard-working immigrants when they come to a new country.",1107561600,19,1282,4.495689655172414
1793851,1,B00006SFKL,"I have always enjoyed movies that have to do with life on the street and anything that deals with the hispanic culture. I usually cant stop a watching a movie until its over,once it starts it will finish. It took five minutes while watching this movie to decide to turn it off,and it wasn't a hard desicion. It looks like a low budget film with poor actors. It looks like they are not even trying. I love movies and this has to be the worst one I have ever seen. Sorry to be blunt but the truth hurts.",1101859200,13,501,4.122448979591836
1793852,4,B00006SFKL,This is a tru to life movie. It shows the struggles that immigrants and chicanos go through.,1057622400,6,92,4.470588235294118
7973239,4,B00006SFKL,"I remember looking for a movie to see at Blockbuster Video.  I never heard of this movie before but reading the notes on the cover it sounded like a terrible calamity, so bad that I had to rent it.  I can't think of too many movies that I laughed through more.  Problem is that it's not a comedy, just a hilariously bad movie made on the cheap.  A little girl is shot in the chest, but in the hospital scene her head is wrapped up.  Another point in the movie, one of the characters is supposed to be coming out of his bedroom, which is clearly a hall closet.  If someone wants to get drunk with friends, watch this movie and do shots every time you see something like that or see a microphone.",1437696000,,694,4.141791044776119
7973240,5,B00006SFKL,"B-rate movie, just like I like 'em.  It does have a story to tell which what I like about it.  If you've had struggles you can relate.",1437177600,,134,3.925925925925926

7973242,3,B00006SFKL,"It could have been a lil better told & directed. I also think the acting could have been a lil better, but there was good topics & some touching subjects. Got to watch it on youtube, so it's not like I got stuck w/the dvd. It was ok to at least watch once.",1292716800,,256,3.849056603773585
7973243,4,B00006SFKL,"The movie came on time it deals with a lot of everyday urban life,real problems that are related to hispanic culture,even some of those problems are common among many people,some the actors did not try enough,but then again there are crappier chicano movies out there.",1280707200,,268,4.977777777777778
7973244,1,B00006SFKL,"So i'm a big fan of Gangster flicks I own several such as Boulevard Nights and Duke Of Earl if you don't know there both low budget films like this one only the acting is a stounding it's brilliant! it shows how noble how heroic gangsters really are... how they take pride in what they believe, Stand up for themselves so high and mighty, there's a great story, a plot, this film here is everything those films are not it's HORRABLE! let's start with the acting I understand this is a low budget film but so are many others that does not mean that the acting cant be somewhat good. These actors are not even trying to do a good job it's like lets hurry get through the flick until it's done! There's no passion, no feeling in there acting, it's dull, borring, looks to much like an act, a play gone bad not to mention there is way to much violence in this film, to bloody, gory it's enough to make you sick! Next thing is the story what is the real story here a family living in the ghetto trying to make it in a war zone (yawn) that sounds familiar... If your going to make a flick that has to do with REAL gangster life and the true ways of life in the ghetto like so many other films you have to make it worth watching. Does it have the makings of a great film? what's the story?  does it have a good plot? does it make sence? is the acting good? There are so many movies that show you the TRUE gangster ways what life is really like on the streets. Knowing this the person who made this film should have put a little more time and effort into making this. I was exstremly dissapointed in this being the whole idea of this film could have been great if just more passion and feeling was put into making this. Great stars on the cover it had me thinking this looks like a great flick but what good is a cover if the film itself is a total flop! Bottom line this could have been such a great film and ended up being one of the WORST! Don't waste your time with it... even if it's being sold for a penny even if a friend gives it to you for free they can keep it. It's to much of a dissapointment! Good idea gone bad!",1262044800,,2117,4.064593301435407
7973245,1,B00006SFKL,This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is the acting bad but the cinematography is atrocious. I generally tend to like Chicano cinema but this is just bad. A serious stinker in my book. Avoid it at all cost,1200096000,3,233,4.2
7973246,1,B00006SFKL,This movie is straight basura. Garbage. If you want to laugh at a low budget crappy latino gangster movie then this movie is for you. I laughed at the MOVIE becuz it was sooo bad that it made me laugh. The fight scene between the brothers was comical they fought each other like Popeye. You should watch this movie with beers and friend and laugh at how bad it is........the artistic brother gets show with a Rifle at the end...yet he survives??? haha what bull.,1190332800,,462,4.447058823529412
7973247,5,B00006SFKL,"After I garnered my first speaking/supporting role in the feature film entitled ""The Price of the American Dream II"" a few months ago, I was more than intrigued to at least see what the first one was about. The second was such an independent film made on a tight budget ($100,000) I figured the first one could only compare the same way especially since no one except the filmmakers had heard of it. I remembered seeing bits and pieces of the first in grade school but not much. Despite that, I felt different about this film. There was something about it that drew me in like no other did even though I had no idea of the first. I would later see the future would predict my past.

The Munoz family is in trouble and it isn't the fault of the parents. Christian, one of the sons, has become a gangbanger, Maria, a daughter, has already had two children and parties all the time, Chendo is struggling to learn English, Jackie, the other daughter, spends all her time with her sleazy boyfriend, and the parents are all but losing it over the fact that they should've never come to America. But a glimmer of light is enholding within the youngest son, Meno, who is in hopes of going to college and Laura, who is the goddaughter and wishing to finish up her career wishes in sociology at the local university. The sad thing is despite the dreams that both Laura and Meno hold, no one seems to care.

The Price of the American Dream is such an amazing put together story and equally great film that I kept thinking I was watching a documentary about real people. Indeed, it is very real to some, if not most of us. The portrayal of the Munoz family as nearly all the sons and daughters turning to the evils of the American world while not focusing on the reality of anything, and of course the extreme consequences that follow soon after. Then when some good finally comes into their lives the only ones who can accept it and enjoy it are the ones who really take the bad things to heart because they are the only souls who care. This is Laura and Meno in the film. They try their best to help their family but no one wants to open up enough for them to do so.

Even though I'm a boy, Laura was the one I found I related to the most considering the people I love to be with the most and the only ones who are my real friends all the Mexicans. Yet I see the bad that is happening to them and not WHAT they do. They are subject to so much and even this film typecast them to the point where it was too much on them as the bad people when it's everyone around them. The movie touched incredibly close to home as did the sequel which will come out later this year, but there is good in all which was also a great display in the entirety of the film.

In regards to the film, the acting by the principles is incredibly good. The one who really gave it her heart and soul and pulled through above the rest was Jackie Torres, who was also the director. In the role of Laura, the goddaughter in hopes of making her life in America is the one who must take all of this in. The film is an amazing display of what today's world has become and how we need to change it. If you are human  then you will feel this movie. Yes, it's independency may get in the way of most critical people who watch movies everyday but you must see through the somewhat tedious acting from supporting actors and see the good instead...the message and the people in this film who gave it their all and that will shine above everything else.

In regards to The Price of the American Dream II, which I will also be writing a review for when it is released, it is because of part one that I am so proud to be involved in number two. I needed to see it to understand. The second continues to follow our protagonists from the first and creates a great storyline around the struggles that follow despite the success Laura had in the first one with the university. It shows that not all stories have a happy ending but for people a resolution can also be enough. The message behind both movies is that we put ourselves in our own problems and never think to blame ourselves for our own mistakes. Films like these will make you realize just who you are and what you are doing wrong. We need more movies like these.",1183075200,2,4268,4.243542435424354
7973248,5,B00006SFKL,"While watching this film, I found myself comparing it to my life and the life of so many of my friends.  I totally related to the father who lives here and still seems to live in Mexico, and to the  conflicts that brings to those of us who were born here and do not know how to see ourselves. Even though the film did not seem to have the big Hollywood budget, the reality of it (everyone looked and behaved the way my friends and family do in East Los Angeles) made it a great film.",1128988800,4,483,4.020833333333333
