3698585,5,B001MQ36WA,"I found these online and didn't really know what to expect - in this day of fast editing, flash over substance I was so pleasantly surprised to find these well narrated, beautiful animated and engaging stories. They grab your attention and totally engulf you in the story. My students just loved them. One of them remarked that they have a way of engaging the imagination - absolutely right. Poe has come to life! Highly recommend.",1233619200,12,431,4.76
3698586,5,B001MQ36WA,"This is a great way to experience Poe like never before. For people who may find just reading the book is too dry, this format is perfect.  It's so much more than just an audiobook. The music and illustrations together add a whole new dimension to the stories.  [...] has brought a wonderful new product to the market. I look forward to many more ""tales"" from them.",1228521600,2,365,4.432835820895522
3698587,5,B001MQ36WA,"The artwork and narration of these two Poe classics is fantastic.  I see that this is a new launch, but I have no doubt this concept is going to be a great success.  I look forward to more titles.",1228521600,3,196,4.0
3698588,5,B001MQ36WA,"I bought this dvd for my son, who loves Poe.  I have to say that the quality is just incredible.  It is like nothing I have seen before.  I hope they release some more dvds from Poe.  I highly recommend this dvd to all Poe's fans who want to experience something different.",1228348800,3,273,4.1923076923076925

3698591,5,B001MQ36WA,"As an English teacher,I struggle to find short,engaging, and largely unabridged video versions of great literature to enhance the classroom experience. I was glad to see Poe's ""Tell Tale Heart"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" spookily crafted, but not graphic in gore- something modern filmmakers overdo. I would recommend it for junior high and will purchase more.",1293494400,10,363,5.385964912280702
3698592,5,B001MQ36WA,"As an 8th grade teacher, I have seen various versions of this story.  Yours by far follows it most closely and the visual images are wonderful.  My students were asked to rate the 4 versions and 99% liked this one the best! Thanks!!",1288828800,4,232,4.372093023255814
3698593,5,B001MQ36WA,This video was a great addition to my lesson on Poe.  I showed The Cask of Amontillado after we had read the story and it really helped the students understand the story.

I ordered the DVD on Tuesday and received it Friday morning.  Could not be happier with the service!  On top of that, the DVD will be perfect for my eighth grade English students.",1288310400,,295,4.327272727272727

3698597,5,B001MQ36WA,"I bought this DVD as an experiment with my class. Since i wanted to try and present Edgar Allen Poe's works in a more palletable format for student's more accustomed to watching things on TV or the internet, so obviously anything which presents the classics to them in a more engaging format is a true benefit. Both for the student and the teacher. When the DVD arrived and i had a chance to look it over, i was slightly skeptical that it would be a faithful rendition of the classic works, but i was pleasantly surprised. The presentation method is excellent, they really draw you into the story and make the classic tales come to life right before your eyes.  And it is done in 100% unabridged format, which is a huge plus in my eyes. As in too many occasions, these DVD versions of classic story's tend to be lackluster chopped up versions, rather then a true retelling. Which brings me to the music, the music enhanced the whole ""feel"" of the story, matching the mood and tempo of each part of the story in an incredible fashion.

So earlier this week i had told my students we would be studying Edgar Allen Poe for the next couple weeks. I was met with what could best be described as an unenthusiastic reaction. The following day i brought in the DVD, which alone got their attention. And within moments of starting i could see it had their full attention, remarkable in a class full of teenagers. You could have heard a pin drop almost from the time the DVD started till the end. I asked them afterward what their opinion of it was, and they agreed that it was by far better then reading the story's out of a text book. A few even said they were so drawn into the story they forgot that they were doing this for school and geniunly enjoyed it. Imagine my surprise at hearing that from my students.  They were very eager to hear whether i had anymore of the dvds to show them. Needless to say, i have already ordered the rest of the series and plan to continue using them in my classes as they are great material.

I highly recommend this to any other teachers trying to provoke an interest in these stories to their students. Its well worth it!

Overall, 5 stars and a huge thank you to the folks at Taletube!",1287014400,,2216,4.368932038834951

8321537,4,B001MQ36WA,"These two short stories are narrated against the background of hand drawn illustrations that add to their darkness and mystery. Perfect around Halloween and perfect to display the dated, yet,  rich works of Poe. As a teacher of 9th grade English I appreciate that it is not animated or in movie form because it helps create visuals in their minds, unlike video games and television.",1382745600,,382,4.876923076923077
