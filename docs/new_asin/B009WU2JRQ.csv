8544770,5,B009WU2JRQ,"This film is a treasure. A wonderful tribute and education about Sri T Krishnamacharya  considered by many to be the father of modern yoga. If you are a dedicated yoga teacher or student, watching this film is a must. There is so much history and rare footage that is shared here.  It is really inspiring to see teachers like Larry Payne, Gary Kraftstow and Vasant Lad in this footage shot nearly 30 years ago. I took it as a call personal to action to deepen my own practice, discipline and devotion towards authenic teachings and lineage. This should be required viewing for every yoga teacher training.",1362096000,,605,4.69811320754717
8544771,5,B009WU2JRQ,"A treasure.  This DVD of historic footage in tribute to Krishnamacharya is priceless.  The homage is through the voices of some of his most illustrious students.  The rare footage of the still vibrant Indra Devi alone is worth the price.  And, there's Desikachar expounding on the trajectory of his father's Yoga, including a routine Krishnamacharya designed for harried businessmen late in his life.  Plus: bonus, a young, thin Gary Kraftsow doing jump thrus at Desi's behest.  An absolute treat.",1361923200,2,497,5.227848101265823
8544772,5,B009WU2JRQ,The video takes us to the roots of yoga in the west. An essential for the study of yoga by serious students.,1361836800,,108,3.9545454545454546
8544773,5,B009WU2JRQ,"I consider this DVD to be a significant historic archive as well as an invaluable educational resource.  I can't wait to show excerpts to my students, and I'm going to highly recommend they purchase a copy of their own.",1361836800,,219,4.615384615384615
8544774,5,B009WU2JRQ,"The DVD ""The First Tribute in America"" to the lineage and teachings of Sri T.Krishnamacharya is excellent and well worth seeing. It is with thanks to Larry Payne and Krishnamacharya's son Desikachar to bring this archival material to light. To learn about the man who taught and influenced so many of today's and yesterday's leading teachers including Indra Devi, Patabhi Jois, B.K.S. Iyengar and Desikachar who in turn have founded their own teachings is a remarkable story of the continuing householder tradition bringing yoga to a wider public around the world. So few yoga practitioners realize that the source of their yoga knowledge stems from their teacher's initial teachings from Sri T. Krishnamacharya, who in turn honors the yoga lineage going way back to Patanjali.",1361836800,,777,5.224
8544775,4,B009WU2JRQ,I enjoyed watching Larry Payne's Tribute video to Sri Krishnamacharya. Wonderful insights and historical perspective. So often we take for granted those gifts in life that we enjoy. This event took place in 1987 and the video documents how small the initially footholds of yoga were back then and the viewer can then appreciate how far they've come in 25 years. The genius of Sri Krishnamacharya is brought to life in the stories told by those honoring him that historic day. Those that have been fortunate enough to study with Larry Payne and Gary Kraftsow will also appreciate their long term commitment to the profession. Portions of the video sale go to good causes by the way.,1353888000,,681,4.829059829059829
