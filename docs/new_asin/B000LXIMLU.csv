8165112,2,B000LXIMLU,"Mr McCarthy obviously knows his stuff and a lot more besides, but the drills are very long and his whole video series (I got 4 or 5) is tailored for people in his martial arts organization.  There is some value in the dvd's for others, but the drills are so long that if you don't have a teacher in in this style you will just get frustrated.  Two other notes: the pictures on the dvd covers don't necessarily match up to what is taught in each dvd, and if you do get the dvd's make sure you have a partner to practice with.",1201305600,2,524,4.077669902912621
8165113,3,B000LXIMLU,"I got three DVD's of this series: Tuite techniques, Shime waza and basic techniques with typical drills. Included are interesting techniques. The actors have a very high level of practice. The demonstration of different techniques and their relation to some traditional katas are well done. The drills shown in the DVD`s are not easy to learn. In my opinion these videos are not for beginners, they are for advanced students and black belts. But the videos should have been produced with more didactical accuracy. For example DVD's from Evan Pantazi are better in this respect. In the DVD's of Pat McCarthy there are a lot of different techniques with 5 diferent point of view, but there are too less explanations. In none of these DVD`s I bought Pat McCarthy has been seen. To summerize, the level of content is very good, but the presentation is disappointing.
