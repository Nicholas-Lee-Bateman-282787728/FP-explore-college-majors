2053339,1,B00020X96A,No a very good video.  Poor quality.  Hard to follow.  Very much a cheat copy of the movie Gettysburg.,1152921600,2,102,4.2631578947368425
2053340,1,B00020X96A,"This DVD is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost.  The film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes.  The acting is hopeless...really, really bad!  Although there are many ""soldiers"" involved in the battle scenes, it's all pretty unconvincing, considering the carnage of the real conflict.  In all honesty, as much as I enjoy movies of the Civil War, I'd like to return this for a refund.  Alas, that's a prospect that has,indeed, gone with the wind.  Thumbs down to this one.",1102204800,9,536,4.771739130434782
2053341,4,B00020X96A,"""Three Days of Destiny"" is a good docu-drama covering the battle of Gettysburg, where over 50,000 Union and Confederate Soldiers were killed, wounded, and captured or missing. Despite some miscasting (Longstreet wasn't chubby OR going bald; Lee, too, wasn't fat) and some over-dramatized voiceovers, this film features some spectacular battle scenes filmed at the Gettysburg 140th Anniversary Reenactment, and a stirring soundtrack. Historians will find it to be an enjoyable docu-drama, while others may find it unsatisfying. Nevertheless, it is a fine film that belongs in the DVD library of any historian. Movie/DVD Grade: B+",1096070400,20,628,5.621052631578947
2053342,4,B00020X96A,"In all fairness, this film is advertized on the package as a ""docudrama"" and not as a drama. The problem is that it isn't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary. As a documentary about the reenactment, this is a fine collection of footage, interspersed with some (thankfully) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides. (Actually, I thought the actor portraying Longstreet did a fine job -- the others were less convincing.) As a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle.

As a reenactor, I found it interesting watching the various units on the field. Despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses, the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic. Of course, given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been ""Three Days of Density"" instead. I kid my fellow reenactors...unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink, myself included.

So, if you want to really learn about the battle, read Harry W. Pfanz's trilogy or Stephen Sears' book. If you want to see what Civil War reenacting on a grand scale can be like, this is a fine introduction.",1093824000,30,1435,4.925619834710743
2053343,5,B00020X96A,"Okay, so they don't have Hollywood stars, but remember that this is an indie flick with a low budget. The directors do their very best by using period dialogue and actual quotes. Another point in their favor is that they actually filmed on location in Adams County, PA, rather than running off to Romania like ""Cold Mountain"" did. The battle is spectacular, using footage shot during the 140th Anniversary Reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg last July. The uniforms and equipment are authentic and not Hollywood knockoffs, and the special effects make you feel you're in the middle of the action. An EXCELLENT independent documentary, considering its budget and lack of major studio backing. This film has won awards and astute viewers and historians can see why.",1093478400,36,767,5.047244094488189
2053344,1,B00020X96A,"Stick with Ted Turners ""Gettysburg"", what can I honestly say about this work of fluff.  Nothing!",1092960000,10,96,5.0

8019763,5,B00020X96A,Not very good actors if ur a buff pass on this one-,1415836800,,51,3.3333333333333335
8019764,3,B00020X96A,"I was in this movie, yet can not rate it higher than a three. That is due to poor portrayal by fellow reenactors. Some of us have very authentic uniforms and do our best to portray history, while others are bored during the summer months and decided to give this a try.

Keep in mind we were wearing wool uniforms in 100+ degree weather and instructed to NOT sling our jackets. Some units lost soldiers before making it to the field from camp due to heat exhaustion. The field was accidentally set on fire due to dryness and pyrotechnics, so many reenactors had to steer around the fire.

While much of the acting was horrible, and the solo in the middle of the movie by an unnamed soldier was quite shocking and almost embarrassing to listen to, please keep in mind the complexity of the reenactors used throughout the film. Many units cared nothing about authenticity, while others like ours always try our best to portray history properly (no earplugs or modern farb or accessories, and we will lay down and die...theres nothing worse than a hundred guns going off and no one dropping). So to get a good feel of what reenacting is like on the battlefield, this is a great source. However, as a movie to learn history from, it may lose your interest although it does tell the story properly.

If you buy this for reenacting information it's a great source, just keep in mind some units are far more period correct than others. If you want a story or information about the battle at Gettysburg, Ronald F. Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"" or the History Channels ""Gettysburg the Unknown Civil War Series"" is your best bet.",1288656000,6,1612,4.609756097560975
8019765,1,B00020X96A,This video is a real sleeper.  A painfully complete amateur video.  The reenactors are trying very hard to reeanact the movie Gettysburg more so than the real event.  They try harder to be the actors that were in the movie instead of focusing on the historic personages that really lived it.  This video is a complete waste of time and money.  The best part about it was the real belly laugh when one of the soldiers actually burst into a musical number without Monty Python to save the scene. This video is nothing more than a reenactor's wet dream with a double side of corn. In a word Three Days of Destiny.......yuucchhhhh!,1234224000,,627,4.5625
8019766,1,B00020X96A,"the acting was very amature..I would select it as a second rate (B) D.V.D
The scenery and the general appearence of the set was very good.",1210723200,,138,4.346153846153846
8019767,2,B00020X96A,"If you are interested in learning about the Gettysburg battle, then this dvd is worth taking a look. However, don't expect alot of passion from the ""actors"" because most of the acting is so very poor, that it is barely watchable.

More shocking than the cold and dull lines were the appearance of some of the ""actors"".  I am not a fan of the ""Lost Cause"", but I was stunned and disappointed to see General James Longstreet and General Robert E. Lee as paunchy and portly. Both men were physically fit and the ""actors"" that protrayed them certainly were NOT!

The movie is okay for its cheap price, but anything over $10.00 will be a rip off. I would only recommend ""Gettysburg Three Days To Destiny"" to the most diehard Civil War buffs.",1208822400,,736,4.518796992481203
8019768,3,B00020X96A,This film war fair because it only review the battle of Gettsburg from a reenactor's viewpoint.,1191715200,,95,5.0
8019769,2,B00020X96A,I was one of the reenactors during this event and for those of you who though the reenactors looked uninterested or whatever; the reason behind that is because there were more Confederates than federals. Plus the location this event was at was different than previous Gettysburg events. For cryin out loud there was a stream in the middle of the field where Pickett's Charge occurred. Not to mention that half of THAT field was burned by pyro so we had to march around it in column of fours. I havents seen this docudrama or whatever but i was at the event where this was filmed and the event itself was a farce.,1190851200,,612,4.473214285714286
8019770,1,B00020X96A,"I bought this and several other Gettysburg related books and films to help prep my son for a trip to the battlefield this spring.  I did not have high expectations, as the previous reviews were so mixed. But I was still disappointed.  Horrible acting and editing aside (I understood that this was filmed during the reinactment and these were not professional actors) the film was impossible to follow.  The timeline and details of the battle were unclear as was the layout of the ground. The narrative was often difficult to understand and there were endless scenes of men moving across smoky fields without any explanation. Try another film if you are trying to understand more about what happened at Gettysburg.",1176595200,4,713,4.925
8019771,1,B00020X96A,"This is positively the best Civil War Comedy ever made, sheer genius in mocking Civil War reenactors....oh....were they serious?....

Has absolutely no bearing on the Battle of Gettysburg, if you're looking for a lesson in Civil War history and tactics, look elsewhere.

Borders on the ridiculous with the terrain looking nothing like the battlefield (I did not realize that Little Round Top was actually a flat field!)

Actors who mumble unintelligible lines, wear real pork chops for sideburns, and Halloween style uniforms, this has it ALL! Sure to make the staunchest Civil War buff to focus on another chapter of American History.",1166659200,3,635,5.205882352941177
