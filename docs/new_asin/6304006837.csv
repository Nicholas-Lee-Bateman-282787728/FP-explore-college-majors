757578,5,6304006837,"I wish more films like this could be made today. To say that it's a jewel for the #OscarsSoWhite and Black Lives Matter movement is an understatement. I first saw this film back in 1981 in a small art house theater, and remembered back then as a 16 year-old why it resonated so well with me. The leading women in this film include a beautiful African-American opera singer, Cynthia Hawkins, and Alba - a smart, strong and seductive Vietnamese girl. Although Alba resembles Nabakov's Lolita, Alba stands on her own and helps Jules come back to life after he endures a long and deadly chase through the Paris Metro. Cynthia Hawkins, the central character in the film, displays a tender understanding that she must decide between live performance versus commercialism in her career (which in today's terms means that you would never hear her in iTunes). I also admire that Jules and Cynthia have an intimate friendship based on respect and admiration. Cynthia handles it very well when she smiles at Jules as he tells her ""she's the queen of the night"" (in a short clip, it is obvious that they never sleep together). The cinematography is spectacular, and for those who enjoyed ""Amelie"" may recognize a young punkish Dominique Pinon. Shortly after 1981 most films turned toward the superficiality of Caucasian leading ladies, and sensitive characters like Alba and Cynthia Hawkins were soon forgotten.",1462838400,,1399,4.957446808510638
757579,5,6304006837,Better than I remembered it.  Just as much a good story and comment on artists and passions as ever.  Terrific characters and good direction.  Still a treat!  Check it out,1461542400,,171,4.6
757580,2,6304006837,"This movie has not stood the test of time, for me.  I was not very satisfied by it when I first saw it in the 80s, and a re-viewing of it this week only served to remind me of that disappointment, plus it doesn't even look stylish anymore.  However, the beautiful Diva's singing is still lovely.",1461542400,,295,4.25

757699,5,6304006837,"Only issue I have with this is a PC-redo of the subtitles which rendered the movie less intelligible...I forget the euphemism they now used, but it was something like ""The North African"" or some such over-complex descriptor for one of the evil dudes, where, it used to be ""The Spic"" - who was more clearly Spanish/gypsy/one of the baddies...villains aren't supposed to have euphemized names, and I kept looking around for some character I hadn't seen before...I should listen to the French to hear what they said, but it was definitely an obscuring to have updated the subtitles against delicate modern sensibilities.",1447804800,4,617,5.0588235294117645

757707,4,6304006837,"The French film, ""Diva,"" was purchased at a local supermarket in the DVD bin of all places. I found this film by chance and enjoyed watching it. American soprano Wilhelmina Wiggins Fernandez plays a reclusive opera singer who refuses to record her music in 1981 Paris, France. A Parisian postman Jules steals her dress and illegally tapes her concert without her knowledge. When her bootlegged tape is stolen, Jules ends up with another tape (far more deadly than opera music). Jules ends up on the run including riding his motorcycle in the Paris Metro in an unforgettable ride.

Jules is running from the cops, the henchmen, and those who want him silenced over a tape dropped in his motorcycle. The woman who dropped it would later be murdered. The film has plenty of suspenseful moments especially the chase scene in Paris and the finale. There is a beautiful relationship developed between the opera diva and Jules. At first, she is outraged that he has taken her dress but enchanted by his devotion to her.

This DVD offers plenty of extras with interviews of the cast and crew. For a French film, Diva was a film debut for its director and won accolades in the French Academy Awards known as the Cesar. The cast recalls when the film was made and how special it was. The film features great Parisian scenes as well.",1435190400,,1322,4.693965517241379

757772,5,6304006837,"I guess I'm lucky to own the original release of this movie (unfortunately on VHS), given the complaints of the other reviewers about the quality of the DVD version. An odd, creepy movie of the dangers facing a young man who secretly tapes a concert of an opera singer he is in love with, this film is definitely Noir. It is almost science-fictionesque. The mood is ominous, the scenes outr, the characters compelling and grotesque, and the music ethereal. I don't even LIKE opera, and I immediately went out and bought some. (The movie, however, did not cure me of my dislike.)
Is this a love story? A comedy? A murder mystery? Whatever it is, it's almost impressionistic, as if Picasso had tried his hand at film.
In some ways, it reminds me of Blade Runner...that same sense of disturbing but unforgettable cinema.",1428019200,,817,4.72027972027972
757773,1,6304006837,"The star rating for the film itself is FIVE STARS--a wonderfully stylish, sexy thriller of the 1980s that could only be made in France. I love the movie. That's the good news. The bad news, as many other reviewers here have noted, is the absolutely horrible job that the producers (Studio Canal, Lionsgate, and the so called Meridian Collection) did in transferring this classic to DVD. It is incredibly grainy and ugly and not even as good as a mediocre VHS tape.

Inside the box there's an insert that states: ""The Meridian Collection presents significant works of world cinema in elite quality editions of the highest technical standards..."" That is utter b******t, when speaking of this DVD. I would urge anyone who hasn't seen Diva to have a look. But Netflix it, get it from the library, borrow your friend's copy, or stream it. Don't encourage these people by buying this DVD.

Now if Studio Canal & Lionsgate were to do the right thing, they would turn over the film masters to the Criterion Collection and let them turn it into a DVD/Blu edition worthy of this great film.",1426982400,4,1081,4.714285714285714
757774,5,6304006837,"One of the first French New Wave films, with a stellar cast and a musical score to die for. Wilhelmina Wiggins is divine as the diva.  Once you see the film, you will want to own the musical score.",1424044800,,197,4.051282051282051

After watching this delicious and refreshingly innovative movie, access the special features and enjoy it even more.  It is rightfully called a thriller and a classic, and will surprise you in many and delightful ways.

But there is much more to highly recommend Diva, including a spectacularly constructed twisted plot, breathless action, an array of unforgettable characters, iconic images (including a classic Citroen automobile), and much more.  Not for everyone, especially not for title-phobes, but fans of French noir and a grand combination of suspense, action, romance and quirkiness will love it!",1402012800,,555,5.133333333333334

I purchased this DVD here on Amazon and as the film started was immediately disappointed at the poor quality of the video. I can't believe they have the nerve to claim it has been remastered. It looks terrible. I mean, it's watchable and after a while you get so into the story that you are able to ignore the poor quality, but it really looks like a bootleg. I don't necessarily blame the seller, but whoever distributes, and or manufactures this should be taken to task by whoever owns the material.

757959,5,6304006837,"I first saw Diva in San Francisco.  Knew nothing about the movie, just walked in on a whim - mostly curious about the title.  And I was blown away, first by the aria from Wally (some 40 years later I still find myself humming bits and pieces of it), but then by the cinematography, the rather convoluted story line, the chase through the subway, and the low-key performances that just drew me in.  This was back in the '70's when most movies were a one-time experience that you relived in you memories.  I was over-joyed to see that a transfer to DVD had taken place, then read several reviews about how bad they were - until I came across one that talked about the Anchor Bay version and spoke of it in glowing terms.  I agree with that view completely.  I'm not a expert on the technical aspects of the DVD, and I may be biased by my sheer love on the movie, but it was a glorious experience for me and I would recommend to to anyone.",1391990400,,936,4.230337078651686

American filmmaking, and 'Blow Up' defined 1960s hipness, 'Diva'
defined a certain kind of 1980s European cinema.

That doesn't mean it's great, just seminal. It marked a turning away
from deep psychology, philosophy, politics or even plot, and marked an
emphasis on style, energy, colors, etc. The movie is about being a cool
movie, with cool sets, cool shots, a cool car chase, etc. The plot is
just enough to hold it all together.

All that said, it is great to look at, the chase is fun, and the film
is fun too, in an empty calorie, music video sort of way. It's
frustrating. If the acting was a little better (the leads range from
pretty good to very awkward) and the story had a little more heart and
brains, it could have kept it's grand style, and been a great film, not
just an entertaining, great looking film.

The new Meridian version is disappointingly weak.  I actually
prefer my old Anchor Bay copy, which was itself far from
perfect, but seems to be stronger both visually and aurally.

A stylish 1981 French art-house classic, ""Diva"" was considered a failure until it was ""discovered"" in Seattle, and after a notable run of almost a year, the distributor decided to re-release it. In 1982 it won four Csars (French Academy Awards). That time it made its mark: now it has been released again on Amazon.com so I upgraded my cherished VHS tape to a re-mastered DVD.

The bone of contention in this thriller is an audio cassette. Problem is, there are TWO of them, each is being sought for its content:

*  A bootlegged recording of an American diva, made by an enamored mail courier during a concert which featured an aria from ""La Wally"" as its centerpiece.
*  An expos of the police department from a murdered prostitute who had hidden her tape in the messenger's bag on our young hero's parked mobilette.

We enjoy unforgettable characters:

*  A moped-mounted messenger boy, played by Frdric Andri, who lives alone above an abandoned automotive garage complete with winches, an elevator shaft, mechanic's tools and assorted paraphernalia. He has no idea who is chasing him or why. All he knows is he has a HUGE crush on that lovely opera star.
*  An eccentric Diva (she has never allowed her voice to be recorded), played by American Wilhelmina Wiggins, lives in a swanky hotel surrounded by attentive servants, luxurious clothes, delicious food and elegant furnishings.
*  An enigmatic character who lives in a huge semi-empty warehouse with a Vietnamese refugee girl who uses roller skates to get around their ""house.""
*  A pair of Taiwanese businessmen who want to duplicate the opera singer's tape and sell it worldwide (there are no copyright agreements between France and Taiwan).
*  Two hired thugs who must find and destroy the police department expos before corruption is uncovered at the highest levels.

During the course of this exciting film, we dash through the Parisian underground, race up narrow alleys, flee across parks, plunge into a pinball arcade (remember, this was made 30 years ago), and end up in a lighthouse.

You will hear a gorgeous award-winning soundtrack (Promenade Sentimentale comes to mind), enjoy fleeting glimpses of well-known Parisian landmarks, admire an intricately clever script, and you will come to love both our darling messenger boy and the lovely opera singer.",1317945600,3,2389,4.957393483709273
758390,3,6304006837,"By the director of ""Betty Blue"" Jean-Jacques Beneix, this is a film about opera, but it is also a demented love story and some sort of twisted crime drama involving two gangs hounding the protagonist with two different goals. Despite the beautiful singing, there is crappy modern music in the soundtrack. The only actor in the film to also appear in ""Betty Blue"" is Gerard Darmon, who played Eddie in that film, but here he's a thug chasing an incriminating cassette tape. Since there are two cassettes being chased, as well as plenty of fake cassettes, there are a lot of mixups and plot twists. The Vietnamese-French shoplifting girl is fun, she shoplifts from a record shop that has Leonard Cohen's ""Songs of Love and Hate"" on the wall. She lives with a mysterious boyfriend who sits in the bath, smokes Gitanes, listens to music, broods, and completes a 50,000 piece puzzle. The movie is full of shattered cars - they're everywhere and in nearly every scene - and there are a few moto wrecks as well. Some scenes of her looking out the window (repetition here, don't know why), and there is a great motorcycle chase through the Paris metro. There is a nice Marilyn Monroe skirt moment, which is good fun but otherwise meaningless. The diva in question is an African-American opera singer who has never allowed her voice to be recorded. The ending of the movie is full of some very graphic violence (as well as bizarre humour, and the occasional moment of subtlety).

Unlike Betty Blue, the characters in this film are not really sympathetic, and I can't really care about them. The plot of the film was difficult to follow, and there weren't really too many beautiful moments - the film was very conscious of being urban, chic and stylish.",1314316800,,1743,4.714754098360656

A lovely and meditative young world of an aesthetically minded and stylish delivery driver is inadvertently thrown into the midst of several clandestine business deals. The young moped delivery driver, Jules, is smitten with a glamourous DIVA of the opera world. His almost groupie-like behavior toward the African-American Opera star hurls him into the sites of several tangled webs fraught with crooks and hit men,the most vicious of whom listens to an ever present earphone and kills with an extraordinarily accurate ice pick. Luckily for Jules, a fashionable vietnamese Lolita and her all-knowing nonviolent French guardian meditate on Jules situation, and look out for his well being. The Parisian underworld of Bois de Bourgogne prostitutes and crime marries with the glamour of the opera and fashion world creating a lovely visual palate of cinematic brilliance.  Jules' champion, has a romance with the sea and a fancy to ""stop the waves"" through mind control, which ultimately brings the little trio to a visually stunning lighthouse by the ocean. It is truly eye-candy, but looking back to 1981 when it was created, it stands as a lovely documentation of the magical-visual world which could only happen in that innocent post punk, pre-aids moment. Just at the dawn of New Wave music, before the fashion tragedy of Madonna, the mini skirts and LP's are stylish and slick even now. The score by Vladimir Cosma,had a minor popularity of it's own,especially the Satie-like charmer, Promenade Sentimental ,and the Air from the Opera ""La Wally"" avoids any tedious connotations one might have connected to a bad opera experience. Gender, race and religion are all toyed with and treated with an open respect that at the time was fresh, though, perhaps not cutting edge.

It was one of those that I insisted that my later, much younger wife see with me on DirecTV when we happened upon it one evening (or was it that VCR tape I made from cable when I was single?  Things run together over time...)

It is a multi-layered film, blending elements of thriller, art piece, culture tour, and sensuous cinema pleasure all into one smooth package.  I enjoyed it's easy to follow plot presentation.  No non-linear construction or view from the eyes of an insane narrator or any such nonsense.  The operatic aria chosen by the director (or author?) for the singer's stage performance literally brings tears to my eyes.  In fact I must close my eyes while listening to absorb the full transporting sound experience.  The music is most definitely one of the reasons the film stays in one's memory long after the credits have passed.

This brings me to the issue which prompts me to leave a review in the first place.  After happening upon my old VCR tape and seeing it once again, I was moved to try and find the film on DVD.  I was astonished to find that there weren't many copies around of the quality the film deserves.  And being spoiled by the many $5 DVD's around, the prices shocked me a little too.  I have not watched any of the ""bad"" offerings of the film.  Other reviewers have criticized various ones, and I think the Meridian Collection version was one that failed to meet expectations.  (Dolby 2.0 MONO - what the heck?  MONO ???? With music like that ????)  Because of those reviews, I searched for the Anchor Bay transfer and have not been disappointed !

Lets cut straight to the chase and make it short and sweet.
First most important thing - I don't understand the negative reviews of the ""Meridian Collection by Lionsgate"" version of Diva, I really don't. Maybe these people have something wrong with their TV/Video settings? I watched this on my new flat screen LCD TV connected to the stereo and experienced absolutely no problems.
This is one of the best French films of all time. It is a completely unique piece of cinema. If you like quirky movies that have romance, comedy, suspense, intrigue, drama, cute boys, beautiful women, eccentric artists, corrupt police, angelic singing, amazing cinematography, excellent soundtracks, accordian loving hitmen and not to mention the X-factor..........then this is your movie!
It is the classic of classics. It is very French.
When I was a ""green"" 19 year old in 1987, a mature age student(female) at college recommended this movie to me. She said: ""just go and watch this movie by yourself - you will love it"". I'm so glad I had faith in my friend that day, because ""Diva"" changed my life. It opened me up to a much more colourful, beautiful and eccentric world.
I had put off getting my own copy of ""Diva"" on DVD for some time, because many reviews were saying that the companies who had transferred Diva to DVD had done a very poor job. I waited ever so patiently. Then my heart fired up and gave me the signal to give the ""Meridian Collection"" by Lionsgate a go. It does not dissappoint. This remastering of Diva is perfect. Image quality can't be faulted. Soundtrack is crisp and clean. Lovely extra features where they interview the lead actor and director in present time today.
So. Go and do yourself a favour - get Diva! Would make a lovely gift for a cinema buff.
Hope this was helpful.

The features are wonderful for any film buff, with interviews with the director, other people involved in the production, as well as a few cast members.  There is also scene specific commentary by director, Jean-Jacques Beineix.  All interviews and commentary have English translations.

The story has been summarized by other reviewers.  I did not see in the other reviews any note of the link with the real-life diva, Jessye Norman.  Shirley Verrett stated in her autobiography that the story, Diva,  was inspired by a very dedicated fan of Norman's.  Norman said in an interview that this French fan--now deceased--was a messenger by trade.  He traveled all over Europe to attend Norman's performances.  She knew him, speaks of him by name (Alain), and was fond of him--though there was no close friendship.

758487,5,6304006837,"The French just have a way with making really cool noir type films.  I've recently raved `Le Doulos' and have continually praised `Le Samourai'; both 60's films, but even 1981's `Diva' is an extraordinary example of the perfect mood to compliment the intricate story.  Director Jean-Jacques Beineix masterfully weaves an interesting and engaging tale of opera, mobsters and police corruption, all the while maintaining a steady feeling of `coolness', a coolness that pervades each scene.

In `Diva', Frederic Andrei plays Jules, a young mail carrier who is obsessed with the beautiful and talented opera singer Cynthia Hawkins.  Truly a diva, Hawkins refuses to record any of her music, only performing live where she can feed off the energy of her audience.  Jules, being a huge fan of hers, sneaks in a recorder to her concert, so that he can listen to her whenever he wishes.  When his recording gets mixed up with a tape made by a witness from an ongoing police case, Jules finds himself being pursued from all ends; by the police, by mobsters and even by Taiwanese bootleggers who want his Hawkins `recording'.

The story is really three or four stories interwoven in a way that makes them feel like one story.  You have the story of Jules obsession and subsequent relationship with Cynthia; you have his relationship with Alba and Gorodish, young thieves; you have his pursuit by the aforementioned and then you have the story of the police case and it's relation to Jules.  All four of these sub-plots are handled in such a fluid manner than none ever feels detached from the other.  They all coincide in perfect harmony.

The acting is very good from everyone involved.  Frederic Andrei delivers nicely as Jules, capturing his adoration as well as his confusion as he handles all that is happening around him.  I also really liked what Richard Bohringer did with his small role as Gorodish, and I only wish that he had more screen time.  The two standouts here are the two ladies in Jules' life; Wihelmenia Fernandez (who plays Cynthia) and Thuy An Luu (who plays Alba).  Fernandez is stunning and very controlled as the diva herself, commanding each screen and bleeding forth her characters personal agenda.  Luu is also a stunner here, managing to caress each frame with a dominating sensuality and gripping manner.  They are two completely opposite ends of the equation, and together they equal perfected unity.  Someone once told me that the acting in this film plays against realism, that it feels almost fake but on purpose.  I agree.  The film is played out someone like a fantasy, like a surreal dream and so the actors take on that same tone with their performances.  There is a level of human detachment here that is subtle enough not to detract from the film but obvious enough to actually create another layer, another element to the films already engrossing and unique atmosphere.

So, in closing, I consider this a definite `must see' film; a stunning and engrossing and beautiful film noir that covers every base perfectly.",1241568000,,3046,4.885214007782102
758566,4,6304006837,"I have to admit, the title, ""Diva"", had me skip over this movie a few times before I decided to watch it.  I had bad visuals of a Celine Dion-type giddly involved in a whodunnit.  Fortunately, this movie is far more than that.  We get a sense from the start that this is a different sort of film.  For example, our main character is a Paris postal employee with a fetish for an opera-style soloist.  As the movie unfolds, we encounter a few other slightly off-beat characters.  At this point, some of us are probably wondering where all this is headed.  Fortunately, there something about the movie at this stage that keeps us watching because thing begin to expand.  The key to ""Diva's success is how the expansion of characters and events gradually contracts back into a conclusion that most of us would probably not have envisioned.

758567,1,6304006837,"I'm so glad I still own the 2000 Anchor Bay DVD release of this wonderful film, and now I'll never part with it. I was really looking forward to this 2008 Meridian Collection reissue with its promised new print, new soundtrack, and new extras. Imagine my disappointment--this is the most appallingly amateurish packaging of an important classic of world cinema that I've ever seen. The ""new"" picture transfer is grainy and indistinct, and the (monaural!) soundtrack is even worse. In this day and age of enhanced digital technology, I can't believe that anyone in their right mind would dare to present this mess to the DVD-buying public. Shame on them!

My advice to DIVA fans and newcomers: Move heaven and earth to snag a copy of the 2000 Anchor Bay version. You may have to search for it, but it's worth it. It is presented in true, crystal-clear, anamorphic digital video and Chace Digital Dolby Surround 5.1 stereo. It also includes the excellent English-dubbed soundtrack (also in Dolby Surround 5.1 stereo) if you don't want to read subtitles. Both the English soundtrack and the Surround stereo are missing from the terrible Meridian Collection package, and the new ""extras"" are entirely skippable. Stick with Anchor Bay's vastly superior version of DIVA--you'll thank me for it.",1217721600,35,1288,5.018691588785047
758568,1,6304006837,"I know, I know: ""Save your technical rants for the discussion boards!"" And I usually do (in fact, I was commenter #1 for the review by ""Mutantchaos"" above). But since I stupidly went ahead and purchased the new Lionsgate edition anyway (after buying into the two comments that followed mine, one allegedly from Lionsgate themselves,spinning like Karl Rove, and the other from a ""customer"" who I am now convinced is a shill for Lionsgate) I wanted to throw in my ""A-B"" comparisons-as a public service.

Mutantchaos and the previous reviewer are absolutely correct regarding the picture being ""cropped"" on the Lionsgate disc; the Anchor Bay displays a truer 16x9 enhancement. Also, the Lionsgate was mastered with a very high contrast level, which highlights every bit of print debris, making for a distractingly grainy picture. The only ""improvement"" I see in the Lionsgate edition is that their transfer sports better color saturation, with more natural flesh tones; Anchor Bay's print has a slightly reddish tint overall when you compare the two. Also, I noticed that I had to really kick up the volume on the new Lionsgate disc in order to achieve comparable audio levels to the Anchor Bay edition.

One nitpicky difference I accidentally discovered as well: The Lionsgate edition appears to be newly translated for the subtitles, and it's not necessarily for the better. One scene in particular that threw up the red flag for me was a line translated by Anchor Bay as ""The abyss meets the abyss""; which is very poetic. The Lionsgate version translates the same line as ""The deep meets the deep."" Sounds a little dumbed down, n'est ce pas?

To be completely ""fair and balanced"",let me conclude that the bottom line is the simple fact that ""Diva"" has yet to be RESTORED. ""Remastered"" does not equate ""restored""; both Anchor Bay and Lionsgate have obviously taken thier transfers from the same flawed master (I started to recognize the same scratches and defects while comparing scenes!).

A note for Lionsgate: If you want to successfully market a ""prestige line"" of reissues based on the Criterion model, it's going to take more than a cynical ploy like creating a sound alike moniker (""Meridian""/""Criterion"") and a lookalike logo to justify that list price.",1212883200,77,2260,5.018666666666666

Sure enough, they have a super-low bit rate, are actually zooming on the image in some areas and have problems with no English subtitles on some of the extras (the film is in French).  I've shown the Anchor Bay version to friends in the last few years all of whom have been impressed by this clever caper from 1981.  But when a company comes out with a new version (seven years after the last time Diva was released on DVD)  it deserves a whole lot better than this.  I second the call for the director of the film and whoever owns the rights to get it the heck away from Lion's Gate so Criterion or some decent production studio can take a crack at it.

758570,1,6304006837,"As I said in the title - I gave this DVD 1 star only because you can't give 0 stars. The film is great of course, but this new ""remastered"" DVD is terrible.

To start, the ""remastered"" picture is cropped and it's mastered very poorly - especially when compared to my disc from Anchor Bay (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diva/dp/B000059PPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diva</a>), which looks much nicer even though it is 7 years old! They even claim that this transfer was approved by the director. Maybe he approved a transfer that was watched in a post production studio, but unless he has gone blind I can't imagine he would watch this DVD and approve of it. This is sort of transfer you'd expect from a DVD released years ago when the format was new, but in 2008 this is ridiculous.

But it gets worse! The special features, including the commentary - those are mostly in French - and have NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES! Really? Is this a joke? I would expect that on a disc released in France, but this is made for North America, and with the exception of Quebec, not many of us can speak French making these featurettes pretty much useless to 90% of us. And the menus (which is the only thing on the disc that looks nice) - those are all in French too.

And Spanish speakers, you are S.O.L. because the listed Spanish subs don't exist.

So if you speak French or English, have never seen the film before and don't care about special features, I suppose maybe you can rent it just to see the film. For those of you who, like me, are a bit more hung up with DVD quality (and I would imagine that describes 95% of the 2008 audience for a film like Diva) - run, do not walk, away from this DVD. This may be the worst DVD for 2008 - I have seen cheapo public domain DVD titles that were much nicer than this. This is a major quality control screw up, and anyone who has this horrible disc should return it to Lions Gate so they don't think they can do it again.

Punk, as a lifestyle and art form, was fairly new at the time, as was MTV, VH1, computers, cell phones, fax machines, etc etc.  There are moments when the dialogue is a bit paced as artistry, and does not seem too real.

There are so much more in this absolutely unique film - just to mention a certain shoplifting technique, or the coolest chase which started in the streets of Paris and ended in the subway's car.

Frederic Andrei is a postman-cum-stereo freak who records secretly a bootleg tape of a great prima donna (played by Cynthia Hawkins) who has never before allowed herself to be recorded. The next day a woman, just before she is murdered, slips a tape that incriminates the police force in a drug and prostitution ring into Andrei's bag. Unwittingly he becomes a very wanted man, followed by the police, thugs, and two Taiwanese recording pirates. Beineix's direction is full of interesting ideas and brilliant shots, though at times the movie is too stretched out and loosely constructed. It can also be maniacally confusing in spots. But visually the movie approaches a modern art setting with its colorful images and Pop art details. The musical score by Vladimir Cosma is also superb. Beineix is also obsessed with wheels, from roller skates to cars to mopeds, and they seem to be scooting all over the movie. A fascinating piece of moviemaking.",1151971200,2,1071,4.955555555555556

He's also an opera fanatic benignly obsessed with black opera star Cynthia Hawkins.  His obsession is so powerful, in fact, that he surreptitiously makes a bootleg recording of one of her performances with a high quality tape recorder and then steals one of her gowns and later pays a black prostitute to have sex with him while she wears the gown.

But little does Jules realize that his already unconventional life is about to become wildly and dangerously complicated.  For two Taiwanese men happen to be sitting behind him while he's taping the diva's concert, and they make it very clear to him afterward that they WANT that tape and will go to almost any lengths to get it.  Why?  Because Cynthia Hawkins doesn't believe in recordings.  She believes that capturing her singing on tape robs it of something precious and constitutes a kind of ""violation"" tantamount to rape.  So, Jules' pristine recording is a priceless commodity for unscrupulous persons who, unlike Jules, want to exploit its commercial potential.

Yet, this is the least of Jules' difficulties, for one day while he's delivering the mail, a desperate woman drops a cassette tape in one of his moped saddlebags just before she's murdered, and some very sinister characters are determined to get it back and make absolutely sure that young Jules never tells anyone what's on the tape.  When the police become aware of this, poor Jules finds himself pursued by crooks, cops, and murderers.

Fortunately, he befriends a beguiling Vietnamese waif and her mysterious boyfriend who has a thing for Zen-like reflection and a real talent for ingenious subterfuge, and he also enjoys a wonderfully sweet romance.

The two henchmen of the mob however are portrayed dumb and have some characteristics that could also belong the Three Stooges. One of them hates everything and will always say so. This to me brings the movie down a bit.

The not-so-good-news first: while superior to the earlier DVD release (which I had never seen, but heard about) the film suffers a little from some muddy sound, and at the worst times: during the operatic performances. Yet, the chase scenes have incredibly crisp sound. But I can't let that spoil the fact that the movie has held up incredibly well after 20+ years. While the fashions are of a by-gone era, everything else holds up perfectly. The plot, the direction, the performances are all as engaging as anything that's come out in recent years.

But even if the movie had no plot and the acting was absolutely terrible (which it isn't), you could still just sit back and enjoy the music and the pictures (the lighthouse scene is absolutely gorgeous). Thuy An Luu is very tantalizing and a joy to watch, especially skating around Gorodish's warehouse / home.

Vladimir Cosma's piano sequences like the ""promenade sentimentale"" are masterpieces in their own right and I highly recommend the soundtrack.

758750,5,6304006837,"Most films are produced by professional production houses and have elements of the formulaic. They are action thrillers, romances, horrors or mysteries. Production companies will use teams of writers a bank of directors and hire actors who have some star quality. Some films from production houses are good, most are mediocre and some are bombs. However most tend to be reasonably simple in construction and use the same tools of audience manipulation.
Diva is a film that is different from the main stream. It is in reality simply a mystery thriller with a well-written comic plot. From that point of view it can not be said to be an intellectual film it is very much a main stream production. However whilst not an intellectual film it is a intelligent film.
The plot is multi dimensional. A courier secretly tapes the performance of a reclusive opera star. The opera star has never allowed her work to be copied so that the tape is immensely valuable. At the same time a dying woman puts into the couriers bag a tape which holds the clue to a major corruption scandal. The film is about the pursuit of the courier by two lots of villains, one chasing the recording the others chasing the tape.
Introduced into the mix is the character of a detective figure who is unlike the conventional action hero as one can be. A character who is obsessed with a Zen like philosophy, who lives in a huge bar apartment and does incredibly complex jigsaw puzzles and who makes strange speeches on the art of buttering the baguette.
Rather than the film being powered by a simple plot each scene is carefully crafted both to develop the narrative of the film and also to illustrate the feel of the film and to define the characters. The opening scene is a glorious aria from the rather obscure opera La Wally. The aria is one of subtle beauty and gravity and it is sung by the Diva of the title who is a woman of incredible attractiveness.
The key of course is that the film is entertaining and keeps one interested, as it does not use the normal formulas and resolutions of conventional mysteries. It is rather an entry into a slightly strange surreal world. Although France makes its share of dud films, films like this give it the reputation of a country which makes films which are more enjoyable than those released by the mainstream.",1082419200,8,2326,4.634382566585956

The film is based loosely on a novel by Delacorta, who wrote a series of books centering on the adventures of Serge and Alba, the former being an exceptionally vague sort of crime solver, and the latter a beautiful and exceptionally young female companion.  The movie pushes the two lead characters of the novel and makes them secondary to the plot, and takes the blonde young girl and makes her Asian.  Beineix is less concerned with their story than with that of Jules, a young man who has made a surreptitious, high quality recording of a African American opera singer who refuses to be recorded for mass distribution.  The plot revolves around his accidentally and unknowingly becoming involved (a la Hitchcock) with criminals, and being simultaneously being chased by them and by others who want his recording.
When DIVA came out, it seemed to be heralding the arrival of a major new directorial talent in Jean-Jacques Beineix.  He followed DIVA with the beautiful to look at but overall quite disappointing THE MOON IN THE GUTTER.  His subsequent output has also failed to fulfill the promise that DIVA seemed to announce.  Be this as it may, it hardly undermines the brilliance of his debut effort.  It remains one of the great thrillers of the past two decades, and as exciting today as ever.",1067990400,5,1894,4.7439024390243905
758753,5,6304006837,"""Diva"" is one of my very favorite movies -- I distinguish that term from ""film."" It has a wonderful combination of a suspenseful plot (based on a detective novel by Delacorta,( who, I believe, has a Lolita complex illustrated by the young Vietnames girl), pop-art imagery, and a thoughtful theme (the increasing mechanization/depersonalization ) of modern classical music. A beautiful mixture of film noir, nouveau vague, and Hollywood thriller, with a self-deprecating sense of humor.
BEWARE OF THE OTHER DVD VERSION (with the gangster portrait on the box). IT HAS HORRIBLE SOUND WHICH IS FATAL FOR A MOVIE CONTAINING OPERATIC AND CLASSICAL MUSIC.",1064361600,15,648,5.300970873786408

I've never read the novel, and even though there's a bit of graininess on the digital transfer, ""DIVA"" has never sounded better; this is a film that's meant for surround sound.  The subtitles on my edition aren't exactly what they should be, but they'll suffice.
There's enough artiness for the intelligentia, enough action for the restless, and enough style for the purists--but the editing is flawless, and it's one of the few films these days I can still stand to watch from beginning to end without having to flip through anything.  Credit Beneix for a quality soundtrack, naturally.
He took a big swan dive into obscurity with ""Le Matin"", but this remains his major contribution to the world of cinema, and had New Line revamped it with a A-list actor and a $200 million dollar budget, they'd still get it wrong.  A keeper.",1057276800,7,1073,4.631578947368421

This is one time that I am glad to have tuned to their show for this film is an intensely entertaining thriller. Not only do the thrills never subside, the developing relationship between the lady-in-question and the young delivery boy is wonderfully presented.  And the operatic performances by star Wilhelminia Wiggins-Fernandez are breathtaking, sending the proverbial chills up one's spine.

758856,5,6304006837,"A truly fascinating film, with a fascinating premise, really stylish production values, an intricate and exciting plot, and fine performances---and it all starts so simply, before quickly becoming thrillingly-complex. Jules, a young mail carrier, is fascinated by a temperamental American opera singer who has never permitted her voice to be recorded. One evening, he sneaks a high-quality recording device into one of her concerts---which catches the attention of a consortium of shady record producers. Unbeknownst to poor Jules, a desperate whistleblower, with important imformation about a web of governmental corruption, has slipped a vital piece of evidence into his carrier bag, so that a second batch of crooks is also after him. He gets the chance to meet his idol in person, and also gets involved with a young shoplifter with the strangest, almost-inert philosopher of a boyfriend...But can his friends rescue him from the nasty folks who are after him? Can he rescue himself?
DIVA is really a marvelously-tangled web: friendship and deceit, obsession and honesty, complexity and comedy, violence and artistry, with one of the most best chase scenes in all of cinematic history. This is one of those movies that I love to recommend to people...So much so that I'm now on my third copy, as people don't seem to want to return it...",1041292800,,1341,5.184331797235023

Even the noted subway chase seemed a little leaden. Oh well, my talents aren't in filmmaking. My interest was renewed with the release of the DVD.

758861,5,6304006837,"The splicing of high and pop culture was, for the 80s, nowhere better realized than in this film, Beneix's debut as a director.  The intermix of characters is both miraculous and clever--Taiwanese music pirates, thugs, crooked cops, a recording-shy opera singer, the opera-loving mailman who adores her, a Vietnamese gamine, an oddball loner guy in his 40s:  all these combine to make Diva a unique visual and aural pleasure of the highest degree.
Yes, there's the famous motorcycle chase scene in the subway.  Yes, there's Wiggins' singing, which is truly sublime.  And yes, there's Richard Bohringer, the aforementioned oddball wearing a diver's mask as he waxes poetic on the making of toast.  How can you go wrong?
And there's the equally famous tape mixup--one pirated by our (anti)hero, Jules, the mailman at a Wiggins concert, and the other providing evidence to destroy an international prostitution-drug ring.  The interplay of these elements is so deftly handled all you can do is sit back amazed...
Beneix really knew what he was doing.  The film is, if possible, even stronger today than when it was first released.  A great addition to anyone's DVD library.  I love it!",1001462400,23,1182,5.051546391752577

She is unbeliveably beautiful (That was my wife's comment when she first appeared on stage in the movie). She has a glorious voice which will captivate those who merely tolerate opera and enthrall those who love it (Give us more movies with this lovely lady!).  The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is that she does not sing enough! The plot is good but American audiences who are accustomed to action movies might find it a little slow even though there is a chase scene which should satisfy even the most ""action hungry"" fan. There are enough twists and turns to the plot that ""who-done-it"" fans should enjoy it too.

Frdric Andri (Jules) is a loner messenger boy, who makes a  beautiful bootleg recording of one of her recitals. He also becomes the  unknowing recipient of a tape containing evidence about the Paris  underworld, setting off a chain of events where everyone's motives are  misunderstood.
