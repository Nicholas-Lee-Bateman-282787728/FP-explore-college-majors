325892,4,6301328329,"In cinematic terms, George Nicholls Jr.'s version of the classic tale is very much of its time. There is very little music, and the narrative unfolds in episodic fashion through long takes with characters moving through the frame. To film-goers brought up on more pacey forms of narrative, influenced by advertising, the film might seem slow, even static, but Nicholls' camera-work focuses on the characters' expressions, making us aware of their true feelings lurking beneath the surface. This is especially true of Marilla (Helen Westley), an actress famed for playing unattractive roles, but who lets the mask drop as the narrative unfolds, especially when Anne (Anne Shirley) is about to go away to school. Marilla's forbidding exterior is contrasted with her brother Matthew (O. P. Heggie) who is never without a twinkle in his eye.

Thematically speaking ANNE OF GREEN GABLES makes fun of romanticism, especially in Anne's characterization. Having been brought up on a diet of dime novels, Anne is full of extreme emotions; she is not just upset but devastated; she is not happy but ecstatic. When she is reprimanded for being rude to Mrs. Barry (Sara Haden), she believes it is the end of the world; and she will ""never"" apologize to the older lady. Needless to say Matthew manages to persuade Anne to revise her judgment - not by force, but rather through appealing to her better nature. In a later sequence, Anne is so enamored of the idea of reciting Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shalott"" in a rowboat that she doesn't realize the danger she is about to encounter; it is only through Gilbert's (Tom Brown's) timely intervention that she is spared a watery grave.

This film is undoubtedly sentimental, advocating family values and love as life's raisons d'etre. Everything ends happily, even though Matthew has a life-threatening illness. In the central role, Anne Shirley thoroughly enjoys herself; she is very good at handling the central character's transition from gawky teenager to idealistic young woman, even if the hairstyles are a little incongruous (her ponytails are almost too pronounced).

The ANNE OF GREEN GABLES is quite short - a ""B"" Picture length of only 75 minutes - but remains thoroughly entertaining.",1445212800,,2228,5.081967213114754
325893,3,6301328329,"If you want to see the version LM Montgomery saw, this is the only one made in her lifetime. She liked the actress who played Anne, but did not like that there was a skunk in the movie as there are none on PEI. I also like Anne, but l think the casting is better in the Sullivan films. At least Kevin Sullivan stuck to the story in Anne of Green Gables and that along with his expert casting make his version hard to beat. What I don't like about this one is that they changed the story too much. The Romeo and Juliet deviation is upsetting as it is opposite to the original plot and in this story Anne tells a sad lie, which is out of character for her and aggravating.

325898,2,6301328329,"I'm surprised at all the 4 & 5 star reviews. This version does not rise to that level. The acting is mediocre and it deviates from the novel in many respects. I realize that one cannot expect 1934 production values to match later efforts, even so, the 1986 version with Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth is far superior. Colleen Dewhurst *owned* the role of Marilla, so much so that when I re-read the novel, hers is the face I pictured. Here, the actress playing Anne is simply too old (16 playing 11, though they did change her initial age to 14) and in the early scenes what should have been sweet childlike innocence  in an 11 year old came off as sort of cloying and false. It's not horrible, but neither does it have a place in my permanent collection.",1418428800,4,779,4.485915492957746

325954,3,6301328329,"I recently watched this film, and found it to be merely ok. I think the main issue with this film is that the filmmakers tried to cram an entire series of books into an hour and a half and it just didn't work too well. The actress who played young Anne (Anne Shirley) was too old. Although she did her best to appear innocent and naive, at times she comes off as a bit creepy in a bad seed type of way, since she was trying to play younger than she was.  I found the actor and actress who played Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert did well, and of course the scenery was beautiful. But they had to take liberties with the plot in order to make the film cohesive, so for instance, Gilbert becomes Anne's love interest early on, and their hidden romance a thing of shame. The ending too was altered, but I didn't particularly object to that since it was positive and happy- I've always liked Matthew.

Overall if you like Anne, this version is not bad. However, the later focus on Anne growing up in leaps and bounds just didn't really work for me. I prefer other versions where the characters developed more and where the screenwriters take fewer liberties with the source material.",1274140800,,1175,4.410138248847926
325955,1,6301328329,"I don't mind when filmmakers take small liberties with a book when producing a movie, but for fans of the Anne of Green Gables series, or even the 1985 movies, this version is completely unrecognizable. The only thing the movie has in common with the book are the names...mostly. I can forgive them combining the characters of Mrs. Barry and Rachel Lynde; I can forgive them aging Anne 4 years. But the wholesale re-characterization of Anne and her relationship with Gilbert is unforgivable. Even if you didn't know the story of Anne, the complete re-write of the scene where Gilbert rescues Anne in the river comes off as eye-rollingly cheesy. In the books and 1985 film, Gilbert is charming and sweet; in this version, he's cheeky and silly. Matthew Cuthbert in this version does not resemble in any way, shape or form the sweet, anti-social and super-shy Matthew of any other version of this story. Marilla comes off as a shrew instead of just the strict and austere way the author writes her. All in all, an EPIC FAIL. They shouldn't have put L.M. Montgomery's name anywhere near the cover of the dvd.",1237680000,4,1105,4.730569948186528

325957,4,6301328329,"In ""Anne of Green Gables"" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.P. Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney's series of ""Alice"" shorts who later would adopt her character's name).

Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story.  The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of  Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager.  As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.

In fact this Anne is the original ""Teenage Drama Queen"" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists.

Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery's story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: ""If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me"". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard.

Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pompous neighbor.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1223769600,,2422,4.805288461538462
325958,3,6301328329,"I love the Anne of Green Gables books and have seen the BBC miniseries as well as the more famous Kevin Sullivan version.  I was very excited to see this movie, the original.  I enjoyed the wagon ride with Matthew and Anne and how closely the events and dialogue followed the novel.  I could live with the fact that they blended Mrs. Rachel Lynde with Mrs. Barry.  Once it gets to the scene where Gilbert rescues Anne on the pond, it is all downhill from there.  The plot goes off into left field so unnecessarily--the story told in the book is so beautiful that changing it into a tired and predictable star crossed lovers plot is very frustrating to watch.  Also, it seems a sacriledge that they say that Gilbert's father stole Matthew's sweetheart when they were younger.  A trademark characteristic of the shy endearing Matthew created by L.M. Montgomery is his timidity and fear of members of the fairer sex.  However, I did enjoy Tom Brown's overall portrayal as Matthew, and in this version more than any of the others does he seem to be a true kindred spirit to the young Anne.  I did NOT like how Helen Westley portrayed Marilla.  Marilla is stern and somewhat curt or sarcastic at times, but Ms. Westley portrays her as domineering and mean.  She is constantly glaring at Anne with squinted eyes.  When Matthew mentions Anne's queer ways and Marilla responds, ""I loved her for them,"" the line is delivered in a beautiful and touching manner than I wish was present in the rest of the movie.  Also, the time passing seems rushed and uneven.  This is not a bad movie, but it is a shame that the film makers did not continue to stay true to the story that so many people love.",1211068800,4,1683,4.511551155115511

325990,2,6301328329,"I admit I'm surprised how well this movie has been rated by other viewers.  I have no quarrel with the acting, which was good, and had I never read the book, I would have loved it.  However, I have read the book so many times I've practically memorized it, and so the 1934 movie irritated me.  Not so much minor changes (though they weren't necessary)--the combination of Rachel Lynde and Mrs. Barry into one person, Diana's blonde hair instead of black, Matthew's talkativeness and confidence instead of shy awkwardness, Marilla being round and petulant instead of tall, gaunt and dignified.  My main complaint is that the entire plot and love story were completely butchered.  Anne never tried to get Gilbert to ""eat out of her hand,"" and did not speak to him from age 11 to age 16.  They certainly did not sneak around in secret to see each other--and it was Marilla who once loved Gilbert's father, not Matthew who loved his mother his mother.  Also, as Marilla admitted, it was HER fault they quarreled, not Gil's dad, and she always regretted it and cherished hopes that Anne and Gilbert would marry as a way of remedying the old wrong.

As far as acting goes, the movie WAS charming, and actress Anne Shirley did a fine job of bringing out Anne's personality.  And I realize that in the interest of time, some shortcuts in the story had to be made.  But I'm a purist.  I hate it when directors refuse to stick to the original when it would have been just as easy and interesting to do so.",1118793600,,1495,4.520446096654275
325991,5,6301328329,"This rare 1934 version of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES is completely charming, and more than complements the range of miniseries done by Kevin Sullivan (with Megan Follows as Anne).

In this version Dawn O'Day (who later turned her legal name to Anne Shirley) plays the spirited orphan who comes to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert (Helen Westley and O.P. Heggie) at their Green Gables farm on Prince Edward Island.

Anne quickly makes friends with Diana Barry (Gertrude Messinger)...and makes enemies with Gilbert Blythe (Tom Brown) when she famously breaks a slate over his head!  Their childhood rivalry soon turns into love, as Gilbert and Anne confess their real feelings for each other.

This version stays pretty close to the L.M. Montgomery novel...for the most part.  Purists will object to certain liberties taken with the story (Anne and Gilbert's blossoming love almost reaches 'Romeo and Juliet'-style proportions with Marilla trying her best to keep them apart), and the ending seems rushed and in no way follows the timeline of the novel (for instance, Matthew dies in the book wheras he lives here).

Anne Shirley (or Dawn O'Day) gives a splendid performance as Anne, Helen Westley (best remembered for her roles in several Shirley Temple movies) is a fantastic Marilla and O.P. Heggie beautifully downplays the role of thoughtful Matthew.  Tom Brown and Gertrude Messinger provide good support as Gilbert and Diana, with Sara Haden as Diana's mother Rachel (the movie combines the roles of Rachel Lynde and Mrs Barry into one character).

The lovely music is provided by the one and only Max Steiner.  The print for this DVD seems to have been culled from a well-worn Public Domain (TV broadcast) print.",1111104000,28,1718,5.0638297872340425

It centers around an orphan named 'Anne Shirley' (I started laughing when I saw the name of the actress that played Anne) and life at her new home, Green Gables.
Favorite part of the movie? Anne's parts with Gilbert Blythe (Tom Brown). Like I said: the movie is WAY different from the book, especially on this account. I, for one, hated the long wait from book one to book three 'til Anne and Gilbert finally ended up together... but, still.

Rachel Lynde is essential to the story and all her children were grown and she was at least in her fifties in the book. Plus, they made Marilla much too harsh. And then there was a scene where Anne and Marilla kissed and it was sure a long kiss. Strange!
However, the acting was above par. I loved Anne Shirley and the guy who played Gil was charming.

Montgomery story is still visible and the spunky Anne is endearing. I watched the two versions on successive evenings and enjoyed both. I did see camera set-ups from the 1934 film used in the 1986 film. Dawn O'Day was a fine Anne and O.P. Heggie and Helen Westley as Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert were okay but how do you top the three leads in the 1986 version?
This film is of interest to collectors and classic film buffs because it is a good film and worth your time, but I would recommend the 1986 film if I had to choose between the two. It is perhaps unfair to judge one film against the other because the later film, beside the talented actors, had more time to develope the story; in the 1986 film Matthew buys a puff sleeve dress for Anne in a very nice scene and in the 1936 film it is: ""I would like a puff sleeve dress"" and ""Here it Is.""

7811109,3,6301328329,"Well now, I hadnt seen this film in ages. Ive just viewed the 1934 version of Anne of Green Gables.

Its quite interesting to compare this early adaptation to the many other filmed versions of the classic book. (In the early 1930s, the story had only been filmed once previously; that 1919 silent version is now unfortunately lost.) It is a rather odd translation of original story, however. For the first forty minutes the film follows the book very closely indeed (with the exception of combining the characters of Mrs Lynde and Mrs Barry into one). In fact, the vast majority of the dialogue in this part of the film is pretty much identical to that of the highly-regarded 1985 version. But after that, well theres only one or two incidents shown in the film that correspond (loosely) to any plot point in the book. And by the 60-minute mark the film has gone off the rails entirely, in terms of fidelity to the plot-line of the book. Honestly, almost none of the book was used as the basis for the script, apart from the first several chapters that make up the initial forty minutes.

This probably would have bothered me if I was expecting the film to be an accurate adaptation. But back in the thirties and forties, novels were almost always drastically altered in their trip to the screen, even more so than today. So, my expectations were very low in that regard.

Overall, Id say call this a pleasant enough curiosity; its not a film that affected me emotionally in any way, but it was interesting to see what they had done with the story. Still, it cant hold a candle to the 1985 version, which in my mind is just about perfect.

A couple bits of trivia This film, as was true of most dramas in the early thirties, had almost no background scoring whatsoever. But one of the very few times they DID use a bit of music, it was a cue lifted directly from Little Women, which had been released the year before. Also, I believe I recall reading that Maud Montgomery herself had seen this version, which she preferred over the 1919 film---that silent picture, which she loathed, had deviated even further from the book than does this film. However, the author said she always felt a bit like Doctor Frankenstein whenever she would see actress Anne Shirleys name on a marquee!",1491523200,,2280,4.567237163814181

7811111,5,6301328329,"This  book, 'ANNE OF GREEN GABLES',  blends the 'extraordinary' with the 'ordinary' !  The story of how an 'extraordinary' orphan girl, with the ""vision and faculty divine"", lives her ""ordinary"" life, in an ""ordinary"" small town in Canada, and wittingly and unwittingly transforms the lives of those around her. The 1985 TV miniseries captures the 'extraordinary' dimension of this remarkable book.
  I think that the author, Lucy Montgomery, was on a mission when she wrote this book, a labor of love, to convey the deeper enchanting value of day to day ""ordinary"" life in Prince Edward Island, Canada, during the early 20th century.  In some ways, this book reminds me of how it feels during Christmas season, when our 'ordinary' lives become transformed by the 'extraordinary' Spirit of loving and giving.  What is that spirit?  The main character, Anne Shirley' is a natural embodiment of that spirit year round.  And yet, this 'extraordinary' dimension isn't obvious, it's subtle like the fragrance of flowers in the air, or the light of the sun pervading the atmosphere.  It's always there, but we may not notice.  Maybe, because the 'extraordinary' is the way life actually is for everyone all the time, but our attention is constantly elsewhere.  Anne's mind was naturally open to that inner dimension.
  I think that conveying  these perceptions in prose or poetry is a challenge.  No one could completely express that which is beyond words, but it's more than worth the effort, because even a candle in a dark room, can lighten the whole room.  This book is a great attempt that continues to develop in the sequels.

The deeper significance of this book is conveyed in the following quote from one of the sequel books, 'Anne of Avonlea"",
  ""Marilla looked at the radiant young face, and refrained from further sarcastic comments.  Perhaps some realization came to her that after all it was better to have, like Anne, the vision and the faculty divine....that gift which the world cannot bestow or take away, of looking at life through some transfiguring ....or revealing..... medium, whereby everything seemed appareled in celestial light, wearing a glory and a freshness not visible to those who, like herself and Charlotta the Fourth, looked at things only through prose.""
  from Anne of Avonlea, author Lucy Montgomery",1480982400,3,2331,5.060367454068241
