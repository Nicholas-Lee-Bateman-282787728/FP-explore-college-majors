8405450,3,B000JLTCRW,"In short, if you're like me and just HAVE to have the entire collection, then by all means, get this DVD. The sound and picture quality are very good. It has 5.1 channel sound, which I always enjoy hearing, and it's actually DVD-quality picture, unlike the original Gunbuster. I mean, that was pretty good for being remastered from the 1980s, but this one has nice, crisp images - much easier to watch.

But a few notes...

First, it's Region 2 from Japan, so it's NTSC format, which means that in the U.S. you don't need a special TV, but you do need a DVD player that will play region 2 discs. Second, if you want to watch this, and you don't understand Japanese, you'd better find a friend who does. It has a 5.1 channel audio track, and a stereo audio track, but both of them are Japanese, and there are no subtitles. Even the DVD menus and special features are entirely in Japanese. I can't say I was surprised - after all, it is the theatrical edition, so why would it have English audio or subtitles? There is also a booklet inside with what I assume is a brief timeline of the whole thing, but it's also in Japanese, and I don't read it any better than I speak it (in other words, I just don't).

Am I glad I got it, even though I don't understand a word of it? You bet. If you're a collector, then it's worth getting - but do like I did and get it used so you don't have to cough up a small fortune for a new one.",1362787200,,1422,4.144927536231884
