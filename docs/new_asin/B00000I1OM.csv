The way this movie so expertly brings together such a vast array of story lines is superb.  The character development in this movie brings to mind other big screen epics such as Braveheart, Wizard of Oz, and The North Shore.  I look forward to any and all future movies from this highly imaginative and talented story-teller.  Bravo, Mr. Forman, Bravo!",1031270400,5,440,4.602564102564102
1218577,5,B00000I1OM,"Ok, when i first got this movie, i thought it was just going to be like ""Air Bud"". Was i ever wrong-
The movie starts off with us meeting James Marshall's character, who we find out was living in an orphanage. When he turned 18, he left and met his wife, Olivia d'Abo. They move to a town called Crocker, which eats, sleeps, and breathes soccer. Everythings find and dandy until they decide they want to adopt a boy.
Enter Clay(Jeremey Foley). Clay really can't connect with his new parents because they're pushing him to do too many things and all he wants to do is fit in. But when he finds a dog, Lincoln, and they let him keep it, things start to look better.
Clay goes to soccer practice and we all find out that he definetly needs some help with his soccer skills.
Then one day at a game, a boy gets ""sick"" and can't play, so the team's one man short. But what do you know, Lincoln can play soccer! So the team continues playing with Lincoln as the star.
I'm not even going to mention one of the player's ganster dad, who fixes the games, or the highly mental dogcatcher after Lincoln the whole movie, or the phsyco boy from the rival soccer team who is out to get Clay and Lincoln, or Vince, Clays best friend because even without all of these actors the movie is still great. Its more than soccer, it's really about a family coming through different obstacles to become closer and friends always being there for you, no matter what.
So next time you feel a little bored, pop in Soccer Dog for quite a few laughs, and maybe even a little bit of tears.",1026691200,5,1558,4.284745762711864

Well last night I had one of those moments.
Last night I watched Soccer Dog.
For as long as I can remember, Robert De Niro has been my favourite actor.  Mean Streets.  Goodfellas.  Even Rocky & Bullwinkle.  But last night that changed.
Last night I watched Soccer Dog.
You know, I didn't even manage to catch the dog's real name when watching the credits.  Perhaps it really is Lincoln.  But one thing's for sure, the canine thespian is a revolutionary force that will dominate the acting profession like no other animal (or even human) has done before.
Oh yes.  Last night I watched Soccer Dog.",1016409600,8,763,4.544117647058823

7909233,1,B00000I1OM,"Where to begin?!  I don't normally write reviews, but this movie was so remarkably bad that I couldn't remain silent.  The plot is thin, the acting is awful, the writing is worse.  Save your time and money!  If you MUST watch a movie about a dog playing soccer, go for the ""Air Bud"" version.",1209945600,2,291,4.333333333333333
7909234,5,B00000I1OM,"A fantastic little dog. My dog is almost the same. He believes to be one of the kids.

Besides,the story is well performed,(apart from some violent scenes)

but it is adviced that the kids watching this,ought to be accompanied by their parents.

That dog is super fa-vo-lo-so

Fabulous n' cute.

Simply the key of the whole story.",1146873600,,330,4.719298245614035

7909236,1,B00000I1OM,"This purports to be a fun children's movie about a dog playing soccer and an orphan fitting in with his new family.  Instead, it has an evil twist that includes a demonic dog catcher that terrorizes the canines and mean-spirited children being nasty to other kids.  I ended up fast forwarding to only the dog playing soccer parts; the other parts were either too stupid, scary or ill-conceived to let my daughter watch them.  I don't know why a child's movie has to have such cruelty and nastiness.

Besides the above, the plot and dialogue is terribly crafted.  This is one I would definitely avoid--regardless of the cute cover that appeals to children.",1104192000,14,655,4.761061946902655
7909237,3,B00000I1OM,"As much as I wanted to like SOCCER DOG THE MOVIE, when it was over, I felt very little.  The premise is cute but the execution of the movie was so ill-conceived that in its attempts to be a canine ROCKY, all we get is some bad one-liners, an inept cast, and a movie that seemed much longer than its ninety minutes.  Jeremy Foley tries hard as the orphan taken in by former orphan James Marshall and Olivia d'abo.  But the movie is filled with so many distractions that it loses its energy early and never gets it back.  The addition of the three stooges at the DMV is preposterously unfunny; Billy Drago's demonic dog catcher merely a boring plot device; and the ultimate soccer game has little tension or excitement.  Lincoln's return to his original owner is also a letdown, and the addition of the new golden retriever only sets up the unnecessary sequel.

While the family may enjoy it, I don't think adults will find it stimulating, so let the kids watch it alone.",1097712000,5,969,4.4772727272727275
