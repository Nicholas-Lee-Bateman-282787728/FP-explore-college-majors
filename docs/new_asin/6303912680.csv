7855031,4,6303912680,"These retro tv shows are cool and seldom seen on any broadcast station. As I am an old fossil I still have a working VCR in my home and it is hooked up to a new flatscreen tv too!  I was upset that VHS video went away for some stuff called ""streaming video"" anyway. They are worth the $3 if you can still play them.",1377475200,,315,3.8461538461538463
7855032,5,6303912680,"Do you remember what television show inherited the ""I Love Lucy"" timeslot on Monday nights at 9:00 EST? It was ""Make Room for Daddy"" starring Danny Thomas, who never guest starred on ""I Love Lucy"" because the two shows were sponsored by rival cigarette commercials (remember, until the Quiz Show scandal television shows had a single sponsor). It was not until December 1, 1958 that Danny Thomas and the rest of the ""Make Room for Daddy"" cast were worked into the seventh special of ""The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show"" (which was called ""The Luci & Desi Show"" when these specials were aired on CBS as summer series from 1962-1967). Most of these specials (which aired several times throughout the year) featured the Ricardos and Mertzes at exotic locations, but for this one the fun stays close to home.

Danny Willaims (Thomas) and his wife Kathy (Marjorie Lord) want to give their children Rusty (Rusty Hamer) and Linda (Angela Cartwright), a couple of months enjoying the fresh country air so they rent the Ricardos' Connecticut home while Lucy and Ricky are going to be off in Hollywood making a movie. Of course, when the Williams family arrives they discover that Ricky's picture deal fell through. However, Danny refuses to move out which forces the Ricardos to stay with the Mertzes. This proves to be too much for Lucy, who simply cannot stand the idea that strange people are living in her home doing who knows what. Actually, Lucy has a good idea of what the Williams are doing because she pops in every couple of minutes to check on her plants and whatnot. The episode ends with a snowball fight and a day in court for the six (supposed) adults in front of a judge played by Gale Gordon.

""Make Room for Danny"" is a solid hour-long ""Lucy"" episode which bonus points simply for putting Danny Thomas and Lucille Ball in so many scenes together. Their chemistry is pretty good and you have to wonder if the simple play on the title of Thomas's show inspired the relatively simple premise of this episode. It is certainly enjoyable to see Thomas doing some physical humor as well as going toe-to-toe with Lucy in the comic timing department. Not quite as funny as the second episode in the series with Tallulah Bankhead, but overall much more enjoyable given the presence of Thomas and his television family.",1124496000,,2315,4.741935483870968
7855033,5,6303912680,"This is one of the best Lucy-Desi specials ever!  There is definantly chemistry between Lucy and Danny.  Trouble begins when Ricky loans out the house to Danny for several months, while he is making a movie.  All is  well, until the movie is canceled.  Of course, this leads to many  disasters, which could only happen to Lucy.  Loads of fun for the whole  family!",963014400,,364,4.578125
