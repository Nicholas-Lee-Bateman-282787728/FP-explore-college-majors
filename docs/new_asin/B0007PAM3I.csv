2229326,2,B0007PAM3I,"My son who is 4 years old, loves Garfield.  So when I saw this dvd, I snatched it up.  It really wasn't what I expected at all.  It seems to start out slow and boring and then as it progresses, it just gets weird.  I think the weirdest part is when Garfield is doing his many lives...seems dry. Some of the content is questionable, therefore the dvd has magically disappeared.  If you are a hardcore collector, have at it.  Otherwise, there are other funnier cartoons out there that hold a young ones attention.",1124150400,6,511,4.440860215053763
2229327,4,B0007PAM3I,"When I was 8 years old, I was already a huge fan of Nancy Drew and any kind of mystery story I could get my hands on.  I was also a huge Garfield fan...and then came the cartoon I watched repeatedly on VHS, ""Garfield's Babes & Bullets.""  My parents taped it for me on a whim, and then were repeatedly subjected to my viewing of it over and over again.  I thought it was the best cartoon in the world...so you can imagine my trauma and tears when they taped over it a couple of years later.  I have been waiting my whole life for this cartoon on DVD, so now that my life is complete, I recommend any die-hard Garfield fans to check out this great murder-mystery done in classic film noir style.  There are two other cartoons on this DVD, including the sometimes amusing, sometimes wacky ""Garfield: His 9 Lives"" and the passable/forgettable ""Garfield's Feline Fantasies""...but who cares when ""Babes and Bullets"" showcases some of the best wit and entertainment Garfield has to offer?  It's worth it for the one cartoon alone, says this (still-young at heart) die-hard fan.",1121472000,,1070,4.575916230366492
2229328,4,B0007PAM3I,"Ok...I am a big Garfield fan and I loved the Garfield Holiday celebrations DVD that came out last year because those were some of my all-time faves..but...while the toons on this DVD are very good I'd like to see it more in the $10 price range, especially considering you get some 9 hours of material on the Garfield and Friends boxed sets for just over $30 while this DVD is just two hours.  Oh well...you get two 30 minute Garfield toons and one hour long toon along with a Strawberry Shortcake trailer.

""Garfield's Nine Lives"" is an hour-long Garfield special originally show in 1988.  Garfield looks back on his various nine lives such as his prehistoric life, Garfield's life as a member of Royalty, Garfield in Silent movies, Garfield in the future and more.

""Garfield's Babes & Bullets"" is a spoof of crime noir films as Garfield plays detective Sam ""Spayed"" working a case involving a mysterious dame.  This one won an Emmy award.

""Garfield's Feline Fantasies"" has Garfield fantasizing about commanding a sub and being an Indiana Jones-style adventurer.

To be sure, these are all great, especially Garfield's nine lives.  I suppose $15 isn't so bad, especially for great material.",1117152000,8,1192,4.895522388059701
2229329,5,B0007PAM3I,"I don't really remember much about the other two specials on this disk, I personally have been waiting a long time for Garfield, his nine live to come out.

  His lives rang from being a prehistoric cave-cat, the beloved pet of an Egyptian pharaoh, the third he belongs to a girl named Chloe and they live in a ""wonderland"" like garden, the forth he belongs to a court musician, the next he's a stunt cat, then is my favorite life (he also says 6 must be his lucky number leading me to believe this is his favorite life too.)  In which he is given to a little girl named Sara for her eight birthday along with piano lessons, he grows up with her as she grows into adulthood and become a piano player. The end of this story has always made me cry from the first time I saw it to this day. (and I'm 21 now) In life seven Garfield is a lab test subject that escapes and actually gets away in a most interesting manner. Number 8 is the life we all know and love in witch Garfield lives with John and Oddie. In this one we get to see Garfield in his first moments in the Italian restaurant he was born it before he is adopted by John. The ninth life Garfield give us a ""sneak preview"" of, Garfield and Oddie are astronauts going into space and has a great ending.",1116633600,13,1258,4.14344262295082
2229330,5,B0007PAM3I,all the garfields are good so this ought to be good too. can't wait to get it.,1114387200,,78,3.6470588235294117

2229342,4,B0007PAM3I,"When I was a child, my family would often tape certain TV specials so us kids could watch them over and over again, oftentimes until we wore out the tape.  Several ""Garfield"" TV specials were among these, including ""Babes and Bullets,"" a sort of tribute/parody of classic film noir detective stories, and ""Garfield: His Nine Lives,"" a series of vignettes about Garfield's previous lives.  Over the years the tape containing these specials has been lost, so I've been quite pleased to see that many of the specials I've enjoyed as a child have cropped up on DVD, giving me a chance to enjoy them all over again.

""Garfield: Fantasies"" contains three of the more surreal Garfield specials -- both the aforementioned ""Babes and Bullets"" and ""Nine Lives,"" and a special I had never seen before, ""Feline Fantasies.""  I find I'm not so fond of ""Feline Fantasies,"" but in my mind having the other two specials in DVD format makes this DVD worth it.

The common theme connecting all these specials is that they all seem to spring from Garfield's surprisingly fertile imagination.  ""Babes and Bullets,"" ironically, began life as a vignette in the ""Garfield: His Nine Lives"" graphic novel, but was adapted into a separate special instead of included with the ""Nine Lives"" special.  In it, Garfield imagines himself as Sam Spayed, protagonist of a hardboiled detective story who has to solve the murder of a respected college professor... and finds a suspect in an unlikely place.  ""Garfield: His Nine Lives"" is based on the graphic novel of the same name (though it drops some of the stories and replaces them with new ones) where Garfield tells the viewers about some of his previous lives -- as a cave cat, a stunt double for ""Krazy Kat"" animated shorts, a pet of an Egyptian pharaoh, a lab specimen, and even a space explorer.  ""Feline Fantasies"" seems to be an original story, not based on any previous publications, and in it Garfield and Odie tear around the house concocting their own wild imaginary adventures, the most prominent being an adventure caper that blends elements of ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Indiana Jones.""

Of all these specials, I like ""Feline Fantasies"" the least.  It doesn't seem to have as much thought put into it as the other specials, and the humor in it is more weird than funny.  That and the animation in it feels more rushed than in the other specials -- the animation in Garfield cartoons has always been good but not great, but in ""Feline Fantasies"" it feels somehow sub-par.  At least this special is easily skippable, and one can enjoy the other two specials instead.

""Babes and Bullets"" is a surprisingly adult Garfield tale, even taking into account that the story was edited for airing on TV (the murder victim is a professor instead of a priest, milk replaces alcohol, and the mild swearing has been cleaned up, though surprisingly a joke about neutering remains intact).  It's told in black-and-white, with Garfield narrating his story to himself (and even asking ""Why am I talking to myself?"" at one point) as he sets about solving crimes and wooing damsels.  It's a fun and clever tribute to the old ""Sam Spade"" types of detective stories, and isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.  My one nitpick is the fact that, as usual, Garfield speaks without opening his mouth, which has the unfortunate side effect of making it hard to tell when he's self-narrating or actually speaking.  But that's a minor qualm.

""Garfield: His Nine Lives"" is one of the strangest Garfield specials, and yet it's also one of my favorites.  Beginning with God (or a reasonable facsimile) deciding he's going to create the perfect animal -- a cat -- Garfield starts introducing us to his various past lives -- ""Cave Cat,"" a prehistoric Garfield adventure; ""King Cat,"" his time spent as the pet of an Egyptian ruler; ""In the Garden,"" a children's story that straddles that thin line between cutesy and psychedelic; ""Court Musician,"" where he's the pet cat to classical composer Handel; ""Stunt Cat,"" Garfield's brief career as a stunt double; ""Diana's Piano,"" a sweet but heartbreaking story about a girl and her beloved cat; ""Lab Animal,"" a horror tale that has Garfield playing guinea pig to a terrifying transformation serum; ""Garfield,"" the origin story of Garfield's present-day incarnation; and ""Space Cat,"" which has Garfield and Odie as space explorers.  The special is told in a variety of art and narration styles, and can get weird and downright dark in places, but it's one of the most ambitious Garfield projects out there and possibly my favorite of his specials.

This DVD is well worth it for ""Babes and Bullets"" and ""Nine Lives"" alone, even if ""Feline Fantasies"" is comparatively lackluster.  Probably best for kids 8 and up due to some scary moments and adult themes.",1387324800,,4794,4.862407862407863
2229343,5,B0007PAM3I,"""I pay my dues on the street, a life full of babes and bullets it's a living that's why I do it"" I first saw this special on-line before buying myself a copy. I am a huge garfeild fan he's the best and is a must buy for any fan of his. Babes and bullets is my favorite having seen it before on-line. And the rest are great too, it's very compeling story telling. I love this dvd and if you love garfeild or know someone who does then this is for you andn them.",1376092800,,460,3.8526315789473684
2229344,5,B0007PAM3I,"I actually forgot that there two other ""stories"" in this DVD collection.  I bought this because of ""Garfield's 9 Lives"".  I remember watching this when I was a kid and was nostalgic for some good 80s cartoon shows which was why I bought this.  The ""Babes and Bullets segment was OK, I found it a little off-putting that a cat would find a human woman romantically attractive but I digress.  The second segment I can hardly remember, but had to do with Garfield having an over active imagination and the trouble he would get into as a result.  Then there is ""Garfield's 9 Lives"".  If anything, buy this DVD for this story.  My absolute favorite was Life number 3.  Number 6 was also great, but it can be a tear jerker.  In all, this DVD collection is a great buy for anybody who remembers Garfield in his finest hour.",1371945600,,816,4.422818791946309
2229345,5,B0007PAM3I,"Now that I'm 30, going back and watching shows/movies from my childhood is somewhat of a hobby. I was surprised when I found I could remember key lines from all three of these features! As an objective review, if you're expecting the light-hearted ""Garfield And Friends"" atmosphere that was the Saturday morning show, you're not going to get it. Instead, you'll get Garfield in what I have to conclude is more aimed at adolescents/young adults. It's creative, imaginative, and sometimes plain ""weird,"" but I loved that when I was 7... and still find just as much value in it today.

If you vaguely remember even one of these specials and enjoyed them years ago, it's definitely worth it to go back and watch for the nostalgia factor. Otherwise, this is also worth the money for the sheer unique nature of all three features.",1365724800,,824,4.7622377622377625
2229346,4,B0007PAM3I,"There were some hard to see scratches that caused playability on three of the four shows, but they were EASY to miss and I know it was NOT misrepresentation, just a mistake.

They were even willing to refund my money (had I wanted to send the DVD back), but I have the show for which I bought the DVD and I am very happy!",1360713600,,449,3.9450549450549453
2229347,5,B0007PAM3I,"Blast from the past.  Garfield's 9 Lives is really wonderful - there are lives to make you laugh and one that makes me cry every time, from childhood till now (in my 30's.)  The black & white detective ones are so perfectly apt to the film-noir feeling, it's really quirky to see Garfield as a PI.  It's sad that the newspaper comic is so repetitive and lame, because Garfield was fun, once upon a time.",1358035200,,403,4.346666666666667

I'm a cat lover, and the life with Garfield being the white cat watching its owner grow up always makes me sad and happy at the same time. Garfield's Babe and Bullets and Garfield's feline Fantasies are both new to me and I enjoyed watching them on DVD.",1346803200,,342,4.276923076923077
2229350,4,B0007PAM3I,"After watching an ubteenth generation VHS posting on YouTube several time I bought this DVD for one five minute segment only: ""Diana's Piano"" (aka ""LIfe # 6"" from Garfield's 9 Lives). I haven't even bothered to watch the other two specials.
I saw ""9 LIves"" when it first aired in 1988 and, when it was over"" ""Piano"" was the ONLY portion I still rememberd! (I suspect it was not produced with Garfiend in mind.)
19 years later a neighborhood cat who prowled the streets at night latched onto me and eventually I did addopt her. (She's sleeping next to me as I write this!) As soon as I became an official cat owner I was glad to rediscover ""Diana's Piano. Bassed on other comment's posted here (and YouTube) this short cartoon has become a cult classic and should be considered manditory viewing for all cat lovers/owners!

2229362,5,B0007PAM3I,"This is a collection of three Garfield stories that predates the Garfield and Friends show.  If you're looking for a quick chuckle and notorious Monday jokes then you are going to be surprised by two of the three shows.  These shows are not Saturday morning skits stretched out into an hour but instead each one is an alternate world onto itself.  Sounds bizarre?  It is a little but is one of those rare treats that appeals to both children and adults.

Garfield Feline Fantasies:  An over active imagination sets Garfield out on an adventure that is clearly inspired by popular movies of the 80's and earlier.  Of the three shows on the DVD this is probably the one that most resembles the Garfield of the comic strips.  It's still fun to watch and has it's laughs but the main reason for buying this DVD is the following episodes.

Babes and Bullets:  Garfield is a hard-nosed detective out to solve a murder.  Yes, Garfield is solving a *murder*.  Garfield narrates the entire plot line just like a Mikey Splane book from the 80's filled with dames, plot twists, and witty one-liners.

His Nine Lives:  This show alone is worth the price of the DVD.  It follows Garfield thru all of his past 7 lives and his future 9th life.  It starts with ""God"" creating a cat.  Not an old man with wings floating in clouds but a ghostly image of what looks like the outline of a mans face.  Garfields lives are not all non-stop laughs (but some of them are just fun) as some of them tackle the issue of death and animal cruelty.  It's not enough for me to just say this is bizarre or tackles an adult issue so I'm going to tell about one of the lifes.

*Spoiler*  The story of Garfield's life is narrated by a woman who owned Garfield as a child.  She learned to play piano with Garfield always sitting on the piano and listening to her play.  The girl grows up and goes to college leaving her cat.  She comes back with a husband and a child.  Garfield is now an old cat and still looks for the woman to play piano for him even though she is too busy with her child.  Eventually Garfield is too old to jump on the piano in hopes of her playing him a tune.  The woman knows her days are almost over with Garfield and puts him on the piano and plays one last concert for him.  As she cuts of the light to leave for the night Garfield moves to the piano keys and gently passes away.  The woman is saddened by his loss but says ""It was for the best anyway"".  As a pet owner and a father to a child I can tell you this episode cuts deep and still leaves me with bittersweet emotions.

Other reviews have brought up the issue of these episodes not being appropriate for a child.  I saw these episodes on TV back when I was a child myself and remember them fondly.  Babes & Bullets and His Nine Lives would not make the cut anymore on prime time television which is a shame.",1249171200,3,2857,4.270522388059701

2229367,5,B0007PAM3I,"Never mind the other stuff. Garfield's 9 Lives is a must-watch, regardless of whether you are a Garfield fan or not. I don't, for the most part, even like Garfield (certainly doesn't hold a candle to Calvin and Hobbes), yet I can say without hesitation that this is the second best thing I've ever watched (and I have a good memory for what I've watched). Not seeing Garfield's 9 Lives should be a crime. It's the sort of stuff that could make you into a better human being. It is nothing like the rest of Garfield, be it the comic strip or the animated cartoon, but rather a series of 9 animated short stories, most of which weren't even written by Davis. Most of the rest of Garfield is a repetition of 'oh, he's so fat', 'oh, he hates Mondays', 'oh, he hates Spiders', 'oh, he hates Nermal because he's too cute', or one of a few other formulas that stopped being funny long ago. But the 9 Lives are unique and undeniably genius. Especially the third life, a heavily symbolic retelling of the story of the Garden of Eden which I'd rank as the single most brilliant 5 minutes of television ever produced by the human race (and it ends with them being innocent of the so-called original sin!), and the sixth life which through its horrendous sadness captures the essence of what it means for a human to love a cat (platonically of course). All in all, Garfield goes through the full spectrum of what a cat is, was, and could be. And the very end to it all meets the standards set by the rest and will not disappoint.

Interestingly enough, this also contains 'Babes and Bullets', which was originally one of Garfield's 9 Lives - in the book, that is. So all in all, you kind of get 10 lives with this DVD.",1196467200,3,1706,4.381703470031546

2229370,4,B0007PAM3I,"I recently recieved this DVD as a gift and was pleased with it in general. I rated it only as 4 stars simply due to the quality of animation- which was of the norm in the late eighties on up to today.

For those who feel this DVD is too ""weird"" or ""dark"" for children please take into account two things, first being that the ""9 Lives"" was actually revised for television and differs from the book which had much harsher language and some content that is actually bloody, where as ""Babes and Bullets"" first appeared in ""9 Lives"" the book as one of the lives and then as it's own more light-hearted and comedic book of the same title-the latter of which is the backbone for this animated special.

As for taking these away from younger viewers who may not ""get"" all the jokes, you're missing the point. You shouldn't be keeping the young one from watching but rather watching it with them. This is why some of the gags are more adult in nature and why these cartoons originally aired in prime-time, to appeal to a broader audience.
