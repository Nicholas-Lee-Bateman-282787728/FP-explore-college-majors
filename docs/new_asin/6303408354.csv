8181563,2,6303408354,"I don't mind updated productions of operas provided they make sense. This Pelleas is ridiculous.  Why any director would take a symbolist work and try to symbolize symbols...does NOT make sense to me.  Debussy spent a long time on this score, and painted every sound and action into the score.  But what we have here, is a musical depiction of a fountain while drinking a glass of water.  Characters stare into space, or seemingly talk to themselves and walk about like zombies. Pelleas is such a beautiful work. Debussy and Maeterlinck did a great job...why do thay want to spoil things?",1235174400,2,588,4.792079207920792
8181564,4,6303408354,"This opera is based on a poetical drama by M.Maeterlinck and is probably not plotted as you might expect for a more traditional opera.  Debussy's idea was to fit the music to the poetry so that the whole opera seems more like musical dialog without traditional arias with a little recitative.  There are two versions available on VHS and they seem quite different.  This version is slightly cut and the story line is perhaps strengthened by it.  The orchestra and direction are very good.  Indeed, the singing is impressive.  If you hear this work and the imagine trying to sing any of the ""tunes"" you will understand that the almost note perfect execution by Pelleas and Melisande, you cannot not help but be impressed by the quality of the vocal work.  Golaud (Jose van Dam) is the exception, and not so much because of inaccuracy but his heavy sound with wide vibrato doesn't seem to fit the rest of the dast and the production.  The production seems to emphasize the delicate and ethereal.  The costuming is late Victorian (as is the libretto) and this emphasizes the formal relations within the family.  The only qualms I have about recommending this opera is that someone who expects the sweep and drama of traditional operas will be disappointed by Debussy's low key opera.  It takes a while to watch this video several times but you are likely to get hooked on it if you have this patience.",998352000,,1398,4.688524590163935
