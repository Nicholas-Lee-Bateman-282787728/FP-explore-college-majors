3854201,1,B0026KNC8E,The picture quality is not good. The sound quality is even worse. The first chapter is especially bad making it so you can not understand what is being said. I would not recommend this to anyone. The story is great but this DVD is not worth the price. (even if it was free),1384300800,,273,4.169811320754717
3854202,4,B0026KNC8E,"I bought this for my suegra who watched it when she was growing up.  For her, it was great.  The only problem was some of the episodes have really poor sound quality. But overall it was worth it.",1379980800,,195,4.105263157894737

3854204,1,B0026KNC8E,"I was hoping that this was the same movie I had as a child and it was but was cut into very short parts that you have to keep starting over. And the whole movie was not there. The sound is really bad, can't make out what the people are saying. NOT a good buy",1352419200,,258,3.709090909090909
3854205,1,B0026KNC8E,"No entiendo porque Amazon no ha censurado estas publicaciones ya que el vendedor ofrece productos Piratas y copiados que ni siquieran son de discos originales.

Me aventure a comprar una vez y de verdad la calidad no es la esperada para el precio y las condiciones del producto dan mucho que desear.

Acostumbro a ser buen cliente cuando encuentro un buen vendedor. Les aseguro que no sere cliente de este vendedor una vez mas.

Por el contrario, les recomiendo a los amigos de Kat's Anime que a pesar de no listar en Amazon, ofrecen material de excelente calidad: Candy, Remi, Mazinger, Heidi, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya y cientos de series clasicas y peliculas y de verdad a mi parecer, se esfuerzan bastante bien para dar satisfaccion a sus clientes..

No puedo colocar aca la direccion de su pagina web, pero si googlean usando el tag Kat's Anime los podran encontrar en la primera posicion de resultados. Su pagina es muy famosa en Venezuela. Envian a todo el mundo y aceptan PayPal como medio de pago.

Bueno, tal vez mi opinion no ayude a todos, pero espero ayude a muchos a encontrar un buen grupo donde adquirir sus colecciones de oro.. como yo lo hice. Los recomiendo!.

Saludos.

3854206,3,B0026KNC8E,"I had ordered and viewed all three volumes of ""Heidi-La Nina De Los Alpes"" (Heidi-The Little Girl of the Alps)  because I fell in love with pure and wholesome story that it told.  Isao Takehata's animated masterpiece based on Johanna Spyri's book ""Heidi"" has touched the hearts of millions around the globe; and mine is one of them.

However, the quality of this product and its corresponding volumes will leave something to be desired.  The video quality is equivalent to that of someone using a VHS to DVD converter with a very old and scratchy VHS.  In other words, the image and audio quality is very poor.  This is the only reason why I would rate any video product of ""Heidi"" with a mere three stars.

Regardless, this is the only physical copy of ""Heidi- The little Girl of the Alps"" that I have been able to find in any United States internet storefront.  Why this story is not more popular in the US is beyond me, however is this product worth buying?  I say, it may be worth importing a higher quality version from another country.  But if you don't feel comfortable with that, the story alone is worth it.",1278115200,10,1116,4.507462686567164
3854207,5,B0026KNC8E,"Me encanta volver a ver Heidi, lo pense un poco antes de invertir en los DVD's, pero valio la pena, este disco contiene 12 capitulos, desde la visita del doctor de Clarita a los alpes hasta el capitulo final de la historia. el sonido es bueno, la imagen es bastante aceptable, no tiene la alta tecnologia que otros, pero es bastante bueno.",1264982400,5,339,4.483870967741935
