8676174,5,B00N47NMBA,"Until release of Spartacus in 1960 Universal was primarily a B movie studio. They were the studio that brought my parent's generation Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman,The Invisible man and Phantom of the Opera. During the fifties they made so many adventure movies with the likes of their up and coming contract players like Rock Hudson, Piper Laurie, Tony Curtis and even Clint Eastwood.
Universal's production values were exceptionally high. The costumes, sets and color were fantastic. The Golden Blade has all of these plus a great adventure story",1427760000,4,553,5.295454545454546

8676178,5,B00N47NMBA,"Armchair critic's would scoff at my 5 star rating, but they don't understand what lovers of escapist fantasy & the swashbuckler really care about!!! Sword & sorcery/sandal / fantasy lovers are looking for something to take them away for a hour or two on a rainy day & in this ""The Golden Blade"" succeeds!!!  Filled to the brim with that beautiful 50's 60's Technicolor &  enough action to make it necessary to pause when you go to the bathroom, this is a worthy addition to any lover of sword & sorcery movies collection!!!  Rock Hudson's six foot four athletic frame hardly requires a magic sword to make him a imposing figure, but hey it certainly doesn't hurt to have one! Piper Laurie is a knock out & doesn't need to be a princess to make her worth fighting for, but hey it certainly doesn't hurt to be one!!!  Add in a magic sword that can be as deadly to the wielder as it is helpful & some really bad, bad guys along with opulent sets & beautiful cinematography & great acting how can you go wrong for a fantasy adventure? What I don't understand is how I have never seen this movie before. I am a huge fan of sword anything!!! whether its history, fantasy, Pirates or Peplum as long as it involved swordplay I was interested! But not only have I never seen this on T.V. but never even heard about it until Amazon.com profiled my interest & it popped up in suggestions. Well I am happy it did & happy I purchased it & if you are like me as far as loving Fantasy adventures & movies with swords you will probably like it also! What the Armchair critic fails to realize is lovers of fantasy & swashbucklers aren't that picky! Unless the acting & special effects are so bad it kills the fun we can forgive small discrepancies in the story line or acting as long as the movie is fun & ""The Golden Blade"" is fun & entertaining & in no way suffers in acting or special effects! It delivers on all fronts for a escapist fantasy adventure!!! I am always happy to find little gems like this at age 49 its always nice to find something fun & entertaining you haven't seen already!",1420156800,5,2078,4.347938144329897

8676180,3,B00N47NMBA,"The magical Sword of Damascus apparently adopts Rock Hudson(he is the only earthling able to unsheathe it) and they are off to help
Princess Piper Laurie protect her father (the Caliph) against a take-over by the Grand Vizier(played by the great George
Macready in evil mode) and his son. Nothing new but good Technicolor production. Dumb fun.",1413763200,2,343,5.035087719298246
