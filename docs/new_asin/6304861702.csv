934455,4,6304861702,"This is a must-have for Carpenters fans (what isn't?).  It's an actual video about The Carpenters in their heyday rather than a morbid retelling of the tragedy at the end.  It doesn't go into the dark details of Karen's  demise, and it makes even the already-enlightened realize that Richard is  very likely a musical genius, not just ""the piano player with the  Carpenters"".  But face it, you want to hear and see Karen sing, and  it's a little short on that.  It's worth having just for the two bonus  tracks, ""Ave Maria"" and ""Hideway"", and for the  commercials.  It would have been better, though, if it included more full  songs and not just samples, especially on live takes.",913680000,,680,4.669491525423729

934525,5,6304861702,"Product arrived quickly.  Wonderful documentary on a great duo from the 1970s.  Such a sad story in so many ways.  So many ""what ifs""  What if she had been able to stay behind the drums, what if they hadn't toured so much, what if her solo album was allowed to be released (could it have turned things around for her emotionally), what if she hadn't met Tom Burris,  what if they knew more about anorexia at the time..  RIP Karen..  you were a true talent

Anyway, a great duo.. wonderful tunes. DVD had some nice extras",1489276800,3,520,4.34375

934586,5,6304861702,"Seeing Karen and hearing her wonderful voice are the highlights of this DVD. I enjoyed learning more about the Carpenters. Of course, nearly everyone's heard the big hits, but I enjoyed seeing the not-so-well-known stuff, like their short-lived TV show (especially the bit with Karen on a snare and kick drum, showing her skills). Watching this reawakened what many of us felt about Karen Carpenter--smitten. Back in their heyday, it wasn't cool to show you were listening to the Carpenters (goody four-shoes). But sales show there were a lot of ""in the closet"" admirers.

I got married to For All We Know, and though that marriage also was lost, watching and listening to those melodic gems brought me back to my dad walking me down the aisle in 1971.
I am certain my career as a psychotherapist was partially prodded by the disease that took Karen Carpenter.

It was wonderful to see the many extensive clips of Karen and Richard, including rare clips such as a commercial and an incredibly gorgeous performance of ""Ave Maria"" from their Christmas special. Also included are interview clips with Richard and with many other people who knew them. I liked hearing the story about how ""Close to You"" was offered to them and how Richard developed the now famous arrangement. Apparently there was an earlier recording by another artist that was not nearly as successful. I felt saddened by the discussion of Karen's tragic illness and death, but I will always treasure these images of her alive and well.",1441238400,7,675,4.869565217391305
934664,5,6304861702,"Growing up too fast has consequences. The Carpenters went from a couple of teenager to world known musical brother and sister musical wonders.

934711,4,6304861702,"Randy Schmidt's excellent biography of Karen Carpenter makes clear that there is a contingent of Richard-haters who blame him (and the family) for bad decisions that were complicit in Karen's tragic outcome. That stance, as Schmidt suggests, ignores how little was known about anorexia nervosa in the early 1980s. The song on this DVD, ""Hideaway,"" seems--with grim irony--to invoke the concealed KC who ended up destroying her. This video presents Richard in the most positive light, depicting him, quite appropriately, as a victim of her death. Just so. But, I wonder, why isn't Karen given a moment of non-singing self-expression on the DVD? Wasn't she ever interviewed without having a script in hand or a polite speech ready to deliver to the Nixons and Brandts? It's wonderful to watch her perform those songs she sang so stunningly; the DVD would have been stronger had she been recorded talking as well as singing.",1430524800,6,921,5.065789473684211

Back in 1982 I worked for the law firm which represented the Carpenters and Karen would come in from time to time. It truely was a thrill just to hold a script of their T.V. special in my hands. She's gone now but she left us with so many great songs and performances. Their great success was due to 3 things:  Karen's GREAT voice, Richard being a brilliant musician, and Richard's ability to know a good song when he heard it. I followed their career from the begining and never in a million years thought I'd work at a firm that would be their attys.

If your a true fan you must have this. You will watch it over and over. Karen is an inspiration to me in more ways than one. Her voice has never been matched and never will be in my opinion.
This has wonderful clips of many things they have done together as well as their battles. Many of the reviews have told pretty much everything but this is my 2 cents.
Karen...your voice lives on forever in our hearts...we miss you.",1188950400,7,581,4.290909090909091
934850,5,6304861702,"I would like to give not 5Stars but 10Stars to this DVD. An image is beautiful and there are also many precious scenes. A sound is also excellent.

It is also interesting that the famous various persons concerned also sometimes appear. The song of Karen is beautiful and the arrangement of Richard is wonderful. There are so many hit songs of theirs that they do not count and go out.

Their special edition was telecast even in Japan last month. Much more materials are included in this DVD from it. I also got to know that Richard was playing the piano of Japanese-made YAMAHA for the first time. Although two commercials were recorded with the additional material, I thought as a Japanese that I was glad for it to be Japanese chocolate and soda pop.

It is an image in which the scene which held the concert in front of President Nixon is also precious in the White House.

Anyhow, it is altogether moving from the beginning to the last. This is likely to be set to one of the treasures of mine.",1178928000,3,999,4.442622950819672

934853,5,6304861702,"""Close To You - Remembering the Carpenters"", is a touching DVD that recalls the career of the Carpenters and the life of Karen Carpenter.  Richard Carpenter is the primary ""host"", although there are many others who contribute stories and information about the Carpenters, such as Petula Clark, Joe Osborne, Les Paul, Herb Alpert, Burt Bacharach, and members of the Carpenter band.

The DVD tells the entire story of Richard and Karen, from their childhoods in New Haven, Connecticut, their family move across the country to Downey, California (to further Richard's budding career as a musician), their meteoric rise to the top of the pop music charts, and finally the tragic end with Karen's death from complications from anorexia nervosa. Along the way, there are wonderful clips from many of their major hit songs, how the songs were ""born"", and how Richard's genius at arranging the songs made them hits.  It is all very well done, a quality production in every detail, and it does an excellent, although brief job at introducing the Carpenters career.  I had hoped that there would be more details of the Carpenters personal lives, but this is just barely touched upon or hinted at in the DVD.  Personal details would have so enriched this DVD and helped the fans of the Carpenters understand the duo even better.  The DVD states that for additional information, one is directed to the book by Ray Coleman, ""The Carpenters: The Untold Story : An Authorized Biography"".  I highly recommend this book to any fan that wishes more information about the Carpenters, as it provides additional details about their lives.

To anyone who views this DVD, please do not turn off the TV after the post-production credits run!  There is an encore after the credits that you will not want to miss!  I missed it the first time I watched the DVD, as I was partially overcome with grief at the scenes of Karen's funeral.

For Carpenter fans, this DVD will be a cherished item in our collections.  I would like to give it 10 stars if I could.

934914,5,6304861702,"First I will say that I am only 24 so I obviously did not grow up hearing the Carpenters on the radio.  That is why this DVD was helpful for me.  I was very curious to learn about the Carpenters and try to get a glimpse of what their lives were like.  I really appreciated the fact that Richard had a lot to do with this and personally talked throughout the whole DVD.  I absolutely love the Carpenters music and watching this made me love them even more. It is filled with Richard's comments, video ""snippets,"" stories from people that were involved in their lives, radio jingles, commericials and even has their White House concert.  An absolute must for your Carpenters collection.",1104624000,5,684,4.573770491803279
934915,5,6304861702,"I have listened to the Carpenters since I was probably 14 or 15, now I am 26 - that is a long time. I was not even exposed to their music directly, but rather got drawn to it through a movie called The Karen Carpenter Story (but strange I can't find that movie anywhere!)
Anyway, what I am trying to say is that having been a big fan of the duo for over ten years says something about the quality of their music. I have just seen this DVD and this has fulfilled my dream of seeing them performing live from their earliest days. Sure these are not complete music videos, but the story, interviews, footages (the White House concert, etc.)  presented are a thrill to watch. Any of us can listen the Karen's music anytime on CDs, but seeing her live when she was alive and well is priceless. And oh, that hauntingly, angelically beautiful voice !!!
The thing I like most about the DVD is how it makes you love the Carpenters even more after watching it. Own it and you will fall in love with the Carpenters all over again.",1060300800,33,1019,4.27979274611399
934916,5,6304861702,"Richard knew how to use his sister's voice well. He knew her range, limit, and potential. Karen lived up to Richard's expectations and in return, the world was given a great star. Say what you will about the Carpenters entire body of work but no matter the opinion, the Carpenters legacy will live on forever. Karen's voice will forever be unmatched as it is stilled by her sudden and tragic death. The dvd offers a glimpse of their body of work via clips, interviews, and snippits of video and promo film of their songs. Commercials featuring the Carpenters are here, as is a radio promo jingle. All recorded with catcy hooks and Karen's surreal warm voice. Memories of Karen are shared by Phil Ramone, Dorothy Hamill, Petula Clark, Paul Williams, John Bettis, and a host of others.  There are snippits of the various Carpenters music specials and one that stands out is the Ella Fitzgerald/Karen medley recorded for ""Music, Music, Music.""  Looking at the smile across Karen's face, she was thrilled to be performing with Ella, whose voice by the time of this special, became husky and was more an instrument of emtional interpretation.  The rare Japanese commercials and the Morton potato chip company are here and are all catchy. With the dvd, there is an extended interview with Richard and a snippit of Karen singing ""Merry Christmas Darling"" from their Christmas special.  Richard has gone on with his life and career, producing posthumus albums featuring work leads, outtakes, and unreleased live versions of their hits, and solo albums.  Karen's solo album, produced in 1979 by Phil Ramone, was shelved until 1996. As of this writing, there is rumored another version of Karen's album is in the works featuring all the tracks recorded in New York.",1046304000,19,1755,4.91554054054054
934917,5,6304861702,"I have reviewed ""Close to You-Remembering the Carpenters"" DVD earlier; so I am writing to all those people who asked for a ""Carpenters, Live in Concert"" DVD.  According to the Grant Guerrero website; there is a ""Carpenters, Live at Budokan,(1974)"" Concert DVD.  It was released Only in Japan in 2002.  It has the same content as the VHS tape of the same, which many Carpenter fans already own.  I am sure the sound and video has been upgraded to the DVD level.  The only way a USA person can see this DVD is if they have an all-region DVD player, or a DVD player that can play Japan-region DVDs.  I wonder if A & M/Universal has any real regard for the USA Carpenter fan.",1042070400,12,671,4.370967741935484
934918,4,6304861702,"This documentary is an amazing step back into an innocent period of music in 1970's America.  Told through various interviews and snippets of some of their greatest songs, one truly gets a feeling for who Karen and Richard Carpenter really were.  The hair and the clothing styles are shockingly laughable (but what were you wearing then?) and the wholesomeness is just too much.  However, the film is quick to point out that these visuals were a product of bad marketing on A&M's account and not on the Carpenters themselves.  Actually Karen was a true hip fun spirit who's first love was the drums with singing coming later - and what a voice it was!
Starting with Richard's early 60's bands, the film goes on to explain how Karen got into the picture and turned the group into the biggest selling American group of the period.  Over 100 million records were sold!
Sure, there are those progressive scenes where Karen gets thinner and thinner and it can be tough to watch, but the whole idea is to understand that Karen Carpenter was the first celebrity to put a face on anorexia.  It was a terrible lesson and the documentary leaves you wondering what incredible things would have been had she survived it all.
Richard Carpenter is shown to be a worthy and talented arranger, but his pomposity can be grating, leaving the viewer wishing for more of Karen, but alas, there are no vocal interviews with her here.
A moving film filled with great anecdotes, history and music; you'll enjoy it.  Extras include several Japanese pop-commericals and a great segment on the Carpenters visiting the Nixon White House and performing there.  That alone is worth the price!",1026345600,12,1663,4.79020979020979
934919,4,6304861702,"If you are a fan of the Carpenters, this DVD will be a welcome addition to your collection.  The disc offers quite a lot of information and footage:  the documentary itself covers the Carpenters from their beginnings as a jazz trio to the A&M hits to Karen's tragic death at the age of 32.  The disc has lots of extras too:  A portion of the Carpenters performance at the White House, some of their commercials, and a listing of singles and albums in the discography section.  Really a lot to like...
Being a documentary, fans should understand that this is NOT a concert film.  Some reviewers are upset that the songs aren't played in their entirety.  Again, it's not a concert DVD.  Buy the CD's.
The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of understanding we come away with of Karen (and Richard too, for that matter).  The DVD tells briefly about Karen's wedding, but doesn't even mention who she married!!!  What was it that made Karen such a tragic figure?  What is Richard doing now and how did the end of the Carpenters change his life?  Maybe I'm asking for too much and maybe all this is still too painful for the family to deal with.  I don't think fans are asking for tabloid-type reporting.  I do think a lot of fans sincerely want to know what was going through Karen's mind, what demons she was dealing with and what Richard is dealing with now.  Maybe that's too much for them to present to the general public.  Be glad that the Carptenters gave us some great music and some great memories, many of which are captured on this DVD.",1011571200,71,1549,4.478571428571429

934921,5,6304861702,"I have to admit, I'm a big Carpenters fan.  When I bought the DVD yesterday, I watched it all twice.  For some reason, this woman's talent makes us all want to understand her and know her.  Yes, the documentary is controlled by Richard, but as her brother, who better to serve her memory?  He does not paint her as a saint, but merely portrays their rise to success and the popularity that they were able to achieve in so few years. The fact that snippets of songs are played, and not the whole song, didn't bother me at all because if I want to hear the whole song, I put on the CD.  The segways beteens numbers are interesting, such as Richard's humming ""Ticket to Ride"" in the interview and the music meshing into Karen's recording of the song.  I really love this DVD.  Yes, I would love to have a full Carpenters concert on DVD so that I could see the live performance in its entirety, but this glimpse at this wonderful music group is worth every penny and you'll want to watch it over and over again.",976233600,5,1007,4.296296296296297

We all agree Karen's voice is  heaven-sent as much as Richard is truly a musical genius. This vdo makes us  love them both even more.  It has shown us the respect the Carpenters  earned from great artists and composers. And it doesn't dramatize what led  Karen to her sad passing - which we have heard enough.

If you want hard or morbid details about her long struggle with  anorexia, you won't find them here.
