1339028,5,B00004CMX6,Film is a great insight to Welsh country life from the early 20th century...be prepared for a few graphic scenes but other wise very moving...,1480636800,4,142,4.72
1339029,5,B00004CMX6,"This is a very difficult film to find, but very much worth the effort.  It demonstrates the joy and love in relationships, even in this most desolate and isolated area.  Looking at eighty years in the lives of twin brothers, it gently examines the bonds which make us fully human.  Transcending film conventions and viewer expectations, it will transport you to the Black Hill and tie you to it.",1172966400,5,395,4.695652173913044
1339050,5,B00004CMX6,"Watches more like a documentary. Indescribably well-acted and filmed. Stark, harsh and beautiful...takes you into another reality and will stay with you for days after you watch it.
Thank you Amazon Prime- this alone is worth the cost of my membership.",1486166400,3,252,5.170731707317073
1339051,4,B00004CMX6,"Stunning scenery beautifully filmed.  Interesting story and insight into rural Welsh life depicted as 1900 to 1980, filmed in 1988.  Good acting, directing.  Some graphic material, farm animals being killed on camera and a stallion covers a mare.  Simple, direct, crises depicted and they move on.  Really worth the time.  Very fulfilling.",1485561600,6,339,5.423076923076923

1339054,2,B00004CMX6,"Not sure if this was supposed to be comedy, drama or tragedy.  Watched the whole thing looking for some direction.  Guess I just don't get British/Welsh humor.",1484265600,,159,4.851851851851852
1339055,1,B00004CMX6,"What on earth is this??? Bad acting. Bad filmography. Extremely dark movie, had to stop 20 minutes in, not worth continuing.",1483660800,,124,4.9523809523809526

1339057,5,B00004CMX6,"Beautiful, full presentation of rural country family life with the addition of the presentation/exploration of the twin experience based on Chatwin's novel. Amazon is clearly beating out Netflix in its broad choice of streaming video. Much appreciated and justifies my renewing the prime subscription. Such a unique film would never get exposure past its probably limited first release nearly 30 years ago. The film or print used itself has dulled in color and clarity and is worth a restoration as the countryside is beautifully presented. Could have used more changing, seasonal scenes. I don't think there is one winter snow scene. Regardless, the simplicity and straightforward presentation of this family's life and the life of the two brothers and the passing of time and generations is very moving.",1482537600,9,805,5.296875

7919851,5,B00004CMX6,Wonderful movie about 4 generations on the same land in Wales and their trials and happiness.  A set of beautiful twin boys were born in the 1890's to this family as the second generation. No real deep plot but the everyday happenings.  The filmography was amazing with rolling green hills and sheep and dogs guiding them.  I love the period clothes and cars how they changed as the movie advanced.,1520294400,,398,4.6571428571428575
7919852,5,B00004CMX6,"This is a fascinating movie to watch. Real life: hard, beautiful and tender. Wonderfully filmed. That Welsh landscape can take your breath away.",1497916800,,144,5.304347826086956

7919854,2,B00004CMX6,Too long.  Plotless.  Boring. Flat.  But lovely scenery.,1492387200,2,56,5.75
7919855,2,B00004CMX6,"This meandering film is short on narrative. Is it about a supernatural bond between twins? A love story that trancensd class? A coming of age story? Fueding nighboors? A cautionary tale about domestic abuse? The film touches many topics and never develops a story. All of the characters get a surface treatment with little or no develpoment. A few minor characters vie for the role of antagonist but non emerge. A string of seemingly random vingettes in which the twin brothers do nothing. Everything happens to or around them and they seem to have little or no agency. Sometimes they seem to have no disernable emotion. Thier father inexplicabley whacks thier sleeping mother in the face with a heavy volume of Whething Hieghts, nothing. Thier father thrashes and then exiles thier pregnant teen sister, nothing. Unless you enjoy a meandering, plotless film featuring 20th century farm life in Wales don't waste your time.",1492128000,2,923,5.03921568627451
7919856,5,B00004CMX6,Beautiful photography.  A really enjoyable film and glimpse of life from start to finish.,1490486400,,89,5.357142857142857
7919857,5,B00004CMX6,"This is a somewhat paradoxical piece, as it has a monumentality in its chronicling of this Welsh/ English sheep farming family over the course of 80 years, but the story of their lives is neither heroic, nor dramatically exciting . Yet it's compelling, hard to skip a moment, for its subtle insight and constant focus on the progression of the relationship of Benjamin Jones (Mike Gwilym) and his brother Lewis (Robert Gwilym), across the life cycle. Born to an educated sensitive English mother, Mary (Gemma Jones) and a once charming and playful Welsh farmer, turned cruel and often abusive, the boys, already in an insular rural setting, turn even more inward as they rely on and relate almost exclusively to each other. They share a telepathy that informs them, even to the body part, of what is occurring with the other twin. The cinematography (Thaddeus O'Sullivan) is breathtaking. The aerial views of the exquisite verdant landscapes provide a visual feast. The music (Robert Lockhart) is excellent and congruent, and the ambient sound is authentic and intensely atmospheric. This is a well told and directed film (Andrew Grieve), adapted from the book by Bruce Chatwin.  The acting is brilliant.  There's a uniqueness to this story that is captivating and the detailed depiction of the setting is transportive. Highly recommend.",1487980800,10,1337,5.128440366972477
