1918547,5,B0000CBY1V,"This wonderful Italian movie is about relationships, from the point of view of four men in their early thirties who have them, but don't fully understand what a good relationship is about. There are lots of stories, but one theme: love, betrayal, and the growing pains of men who refuse to grow up. One of them, Paolo (Claudio Santamaria), sums up quite well the feeling of the four friends: ""To give sense to life,"" he says, ""you have to escape, change"".

The main couple is that formed by Carlo (Stefano Acorsi) and Giulia (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a young couple that has been living together for a long while and that seem to be doing very well together until the moment in which Giulia tells Carlo that she is pregnant. The direct result is that Carlo feels trapped and has a mid-life crisis, and ends up having an affair with a beautiful high-school student (Martina Stella). Actions have reactions, though, and everything will change for him, Giulia, and the lives of those around them. That includes Giulia's parents, whose marriage goes through a strong crisis at the same time Giulia discovers what Carlo did.

Gabriele Muccino's ""The last kiss"" (""L'ultimo bacio"") will allow you to enjoy interlinked stories that deal with subjects very pertinent to today's society, the temptations it presents, and most people's refusal to grow up. You will watch the development of many stories, but Carlo and Giulia's is the main one around which all the others revolve. All of them give us an useful lesson: how many ways we may find to sabotage our own relationships. In most cases, it is up to us whether we destroy one, or take care of it. I guess that, in the last instance, we should decide what we really want and act accordingly.

All in all, I can say that I highly enjoyed this film. It is interesting and witty, and it isn't overly pessimistic despite its subject. I think that you will love it, if you like intelligent movies that also happen to be entertaining and sharp, and that have a somewhat ironic ending. If that is the case, I strongly recommend ""The last kiss"" to you.

1918548,4,B0000CBY1V,"I don't know why this movie is marketed as a comedy.  This movie focuses on friendship of four male friends.  You probably can compare that with Sex and the City to a certain extent.  There is the long-hair dude who fornicates with a new girl on a constant basis; a new father who is juggling with fatherhood & coping with his domineering wife who constantly thinks that he's not good enough; a sensitive traveller who doesn't want to be tied down by the business bequeathed by his dying father and his uncle & yet, funnily enough, attaching himself to his previous girlfriend who has since moved on; the main character who has a beautiful live-in partner who's pregnant with his child and suddenly, his mid-life crisis hits a full stride having to confront with buying a new house, being a father.  To stir the pots further, the parents of his live-in partner also have a marriage crisis of their own.  Of years staying together, they have lost the jest of living and the passion of loving one another.  The wife wants badly to communicate with the husband & yet, the husband isn't responding which is rather ironic when the husband himself is a shrink and he gets paid for listening to people.  To counter their crisis, they have Don Quixote's scheme of going travelling, having body piercing done, having illicit affairs with other people.  In the end, the movie wants to reminds us all that be grateful for what we have and that normality is truly a revolution!  A tour-de-force & I can truly say that the performances from all parties are riveting & you literally can feel the passions evoked here.  The DVD has got additional features such as deleted scenes.  Compulsive watching.  Don't miss it!",1102723200,11,1702,4.693602693602694

1918550,4,B0000CBY1V,"Here we see some very real reasons why the Italian and western birth rates are in serious decline.  This is a very rare production indeed as it offers a male friendly take on the battle of the sexes.  Gloria Steinem would clearly not approve.  As far as the visuals go, the actresses are a feast and impossible not to appreciate.  This makes The Last Kiss aesthetically valuable on its face but it is also rewarding in its highly politically incorrect analysis of life and marriage.  Stasis as a way of moving forward in relationships is a pretty radical notion, yet it is one we are wise not to automatically dismiss.",1092009600,8,618,4.581818181818182

This is different. This film I loved. Is a piece of life.

No wonder it was record breaking when it was released in Italy. Five Donatellos(the italian oscar) to his record.

But the important thing is how this movie deals with everyday drama.

For this movie is a romantic comedy as well as an horror film.

The actors are simply magnificent, And the cinematographic aproach to the plot is superb, original and fresh.

I can't recomend this film enough.

1918552,5,B0000CBY1V,"THE LAST KISS (L'ULTIMO BACIO) is writer/director Gabriele Muccino's astute view of relationships in contemporary Italy, a country long regarded as having marriages of convenience while masquerading affairs of the heart outside of the marriage.  Muccino manages to examine a group of young men who are either 1)married with child and longing for the passion of yesterday 2) incapable of maturing into the role of committed adult 3) enjoying a non-married relationship until the specter of pregnancy threatens the passing of youthful freedom and lust or 4) sleep-around guys who can't move beyond an evening's moment of lust.  There are many stories and films about today's youth being unable to partner for long-term relationships, but Muccino has the wisdom to have parallel stories about the parents of some of these youths and how middle age (and the threat of becoming grandparents) resurrects the fears of initial commitment.
Set beautifully in Italy and populated with an extraordinarily gifted ensemble of actors, this film is a roller coaster ride through the astringent downs and cascading highs of Love. Stefano Acorsi and Giovanna Mezzogiorno are the main couple whose lives we examine and it is their coming to grips with commitment when their fantasy love affair is altered by pregnancy.  They both are superb and it is due to their credibility that the whole series of stories their situation initiates gathers our compassion.  There is much to be learned from this sensitive film, and even more to be entertained.  A sparkling survey of love, Italian Style!",1074988800,33,1572,5.1976284584980235
1918553,5,B0000CBY1V,"This movie was terrific!  The characters were portrayed as very honest and genuine, as the plot follows the lives of 4 men who are afraid to grow up.  The main character, Carlo gets involved in a bit of problem and learns a lesson.  Definately a great movie and I haven't seen anything like this before!",1069545600,6,303,4.472727272727273
1918554,5,B0000CBY1V,"First, watching arguments in Italians is so much more entertaining than watching them in English: It is musical and poetic. Second, not knowing Italian has its advantages: I chose to watch the Italian version over the English version for the reason that I can ignore the actors and focus on the characters. Third, this is not a comedy, but neither was ""I Heart Huckabees"" or ""Star Wars"" (I'm just saying). Fourth, as a dude who's about to hit 30, this movie brings some stuff to light that was always there, but I didn't think about. Fifth, regarding the reviewer's opinion: ""The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions[...]"" As if anyone makes only warm and happy decisions in life. Also, this reviewer's opinion is not true: At it's most basic level, this film showed how some people's perceptions change over time, while others simply do not.",1200787200,3,865,4.8120805369127515
1918555,5,B0000CBY1V,"This movie is a bittersweet treat.  The charming story is packed with energy and characters which are sympathetic in spite of their childish flights from responsibility.  I may be a bit biased because the dynamic of the five friends reminds me of that between me and my four best friends.

I read Roger Ebert's review out of curiosity, and I believe he didn't recommend the movie because it doesn't seem to know whether it is funny or sad.  Frankly, I rather enjoyed that aspect of the movie.  Latent comedy adds texture to even the most dramatic scenes, and the amusing frustration of the characters is underlaid with honest emotions.",1198368000,,635,4.7889908256880735

1918557,5,B0000CBY1V,"I thought this was a great movie.  It had a very deep message, that talked about relationships. How when we fall in love with somebody, it seems like you can't live without that person anymore.  And that love is more than about looks, but it has a deeper meaning, that you want to spend the rest of your love with that person, even though he/she isn't perfect.  And then of course there is temptation.  I believe everyone gets tempted at times.  And this movie shows it in a nice way how when we cheat on somebody, what kind of damage that can bring into a relationship, but yet we should forgive.  But it seems like this temptation, liasions..affairs, it's like a circle, that never ends, unless we get a control of our emotions/hormones..whatever.  It seems like that when a person has an affair or cheats on his/her lover, only afterwards do they realise the mistake they made. That they can't live without the other person, that they want him/her back in their life.  Having affairs and cheating destroy relationships and it's very hard to forget something like that.  The movie also portrays how we get bored with someone after a while, that when we've been married for 10/20 years, we want something new and exciting in our lives.
This is a very good movie that I recommend, where we can learn what to expect in relationships...good and bad.",1182816000,3,1347,4.626050420168068

1918560,5,B0000CBY1V,"Part melodrama and part screwball comedy, this high-spirited Italian film explores the angst and ambiguities of commitment in romantic relationships at the point where ""happily ever after"" becomes disillusionment and disappointment. A young and unwed father-to-be, balking at the prospect of marriage, finds himself drawn suddenly to a pretty university student more than ten years younger. A friend at the ad agency where he works complains bitterly about the demands of his own marriage and fatherhood. Another friend is torn between his anguish over a girlfriend who has left him, his impatience with his dying father, who is leaving him with a business he abhors, and the desire to flee as far from home as he can get.

A fourth friend, still immersed in the adolescent pursuit of endless variety among bed-mates, observes from the sidelines, completely clueless, while a fifth friend has just married and from the vantage point of the honeymoon can't understand what all the fuss is about. Meanwhile, a middle-aged woman, miserable in a marriage where romance has gone cold, looks for an old boyfriend, with whom she once had an affair.

We are flung from crisis to crisis in this fast-paced intertwining of story lines, where the dialogue is rapid-fire and it takes a speed-reader to consume all the subtitles. When the center no longer holds and like a collapsing carnival ride, characters are landing every which way but on their feet in the final scenes, the filmmakers give us a happily-ever-after ending that we can either buy or not. By this time, it doesn't matter, because they've made their point. In matters of love and lust, we are all pretty clueless.",1162512000,3,1669,5.021660649819495
1918561,1,B0000CBY1V,"....for several reasons.  Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film.  The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone...""Think 'Sex and the City' with men!""  Well, I say, ""Think again.""  As an avid watcher of ""Sex and the City"", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life.  These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.  The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film.",1141516800,4,1609,4.8713235294117645
1918562,4,B0000CBY1V,"Il film racconta con estremo realismo in tutta la prima parte (e oltre) l'incredibile confusione mentale a cui e' pervenuta la societa' moderna, libera finalmente dai tabu' sessuali e dal giogo delle proibizioni, ma esposta molto piu' di prima alla impreparazione nella vita di relazione.

Soprattutto per la vita di coppia e' inevitabile il sapersi adeguare alle situazioni di compromesso, se non proprio di rinuncia, se si vuole pervenire ad una esistenza che, pur nella ricerca della felicita' completa, possa dare almeno un buon grado di serenita'.

Fino al punto (nel film) in cui lei (la ragazza incinta) acconsente a restare ugualmente con lui anche se lui l'ha tradita, il film e' una sequela persino esagerata di situazioni negative, dove tutti, dai giovani alle coppie mature, sono delusi, stressati, angosciati e desiderosi di iniziare un capitolo nuovo della propria vita.

L'esagerazione appare persino evidente nell'assegnazione del ruolo di moglie insoddisfatta e ""schizzata"" a Stefania Sandrelli che, sia pure nella sua innegabile bravura di attrice, nel ruolo e' assolutamente fuori posto. Cosi' come le parole che il regista fa dire al marito di lei in quella fase del film; parole che uno psichiatra (il mestiere di lui) non potrebbe mai dire a nessuno, tantomeno alla moglie.

La Sandrelli e' invece perfettamente nel suo ruolo verso la fine del film quando (la protagonista che lei interpreta) accortasi che non e' nella liberta' di andarsene e nel tradire che puo' trovare la serenita' interiore, assume il ruolo decisamente piu' congeniale per lei di donna non solo bella, ma anche comprensiva, amorevole e saggia.

Anche nella scena finale del film il regista rilascia un messaggio esplicito facendo vedere la giovane protagonista del film che corre da sola in un parco, avvicinata da uno che vorrebbe corteggiarla. Qui Muccino trae lo spunto per mostrare lei che non si ferma; continua a correre con un sorrisetto sulle labbra lasciando intendere: ""Lo so, potrei farlo e probabilmente mi piacerebbe anche, ma so anche cosa potrebbe succedere. Davvero dovrei rischiare la mia felicita' per una avventuretta che puo' finire in disastro gia' il giorno dopo?"".

Ecco, in conclusione mi sento di dire che questo e' un film bello e utile; ma solo se lo si interpreta nel modo giusto. Non si puo' prendere come assolutamente probabile il finale positivo del film. Ci sono nel film innumerevoli situazioni che nella realta' spesso si concludono in tragedia. Vedere il film senza coglierne il vero significato potrebbe dare un messaggio addirittura negativo a chi lo vede.

Il regista dunque ha scelto quel finale perche' era l'unico che gli consentisse di concludere con un messaggio di speranza e di avvertimento insieme: non basta la liberta' a garantire la felicita' anzi, la liberta' se non e' moderata e gestita in modo intelligente e responsabile puo' condurre al caos e alla infelicita'.

La felicita', come ogni onesta ricchezza di questo mondo, bisogna sapersela costruire giorno per giorno, anche con sacrificio.

Come ultima evidenza critica direi che bisogna comunque tener conto che, pur essendo le situazioni narrate nel film abbastanza frequenti nella realta' della societa' italiana, sarebbe un luogo davvero comune generalizzarle. Ci sono ancora oggi in Italia un sacco di giovani e di famiglie (la chiamerei una maggioranza silenziosa) che vivono le proprie esperienze sentimentali e sessuali in modo del tutto piu' equilibrato, tradizionale e responsabile.

1918563,5,B0000CBY1V,"This film doesn't offer an answer to a relationship's greatest challenge--fidelity.  Instead, it challenges perceptions about what makes for lasting love and what to expect from a long-term relationship and/or marriage.  While dealing with slightly predictable patterns and relationships (ignoring same-sex or unorthodox relationships outside traditional marriage) the stories are compelling and the characters sufficiently believable.  One could argue that it has a decidedly male point of view, but the ending was a cheeky way to remind the guys watching that women can wander too.",1126396800,5,583,5.8352941176470585

7998926,4,B0000CBY1V,"The Last Kiss is an Italian film about the anxieties brought about by adulthood and parenthood. It is in the genre that mixes romance,comedy and drama that features a brilliant cast.

In the movie,parenthood stirs up a wealth of mixed emotions. Carlo and Giulia are a couple in their late twenties who realize they've crossed the final threshold into adulthood when Giulia discovers she's going to have a baby. Even though Carlo has already settled down, he sees parenthood as the first step towards becoming the sort of middle-class suburbanite he's never respected, and he's not happy about it. Carlo's friends are also having mixed feelings about the onset of maturity: Adriano can't decide if he should go through with his marriage to Livia , Paolo is trying to find a way out of going into business with his father, and Alberto seems to be waging a one-man war against monogamy by seducing as many women as possible. Meanwhile, Giulia is having her own misgivings about parenthood, and her mother Anna is torn between happiness for her daughter and dread that she's now old enough to be a grandmother; Anna's malaise isn't eased by the lack of compassion shown by her husband.

The Last Kiss is a film that is characterized by great performances of the cast. Special mention should be given to Giovanna Mezzogiorno and Stefano Accorsi as they did portray brilliantly on how immature adults fear growing up and facing responsibility. Gabriele Muccino,writer and director,keeps things very energetic with fluid and complicated camera work capturing characters who are bursting with personality. But the film falls short in terms of interest nor care that the viewer would sympathize to the characters involved as it boils down into having a formulaic and predictable conclusion when the end credits roll.

7998928,3,B0000CBY1V,"Movie synopsis:

This intricately woven story centers on four buddies who are all about 30 years old and who are starting to think about settling into a more serious phase of their lives. With rapid cuts from scene to scene, character to character, situation to situation, THE LAST KISS communicates the breathless anxiety of striving to hold on to the fleeting feeling of carefree youth. Carlo (Stefano Accorsi) is young, handsome, smart, and in love with Giulia (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), his girlfriend of five years who is three months pregnant. Carlo and Giulia are happy together, though they are still unmarried. But when Carlo meets blond, naive, 18-year-old Francesca (Martina Stella), he sees one last chance to sow his wild oats. Giulia has her own troubles to deal with, as her mother, Anna (Stefania Sandrelli), admits she is unhappily married to Giulia's father and is contemplating a divorce. Meanwhile, Carlo's friends encounter their own unique obstacles: Adriano (Giorgio Pasotti) constantly fights with his wife (Sabrina Impacciatore) ever since the birth of their infant son; Paolo (Claudio Santamaria), a dreadlocked Don Juan, sleeps with a different girl every night; and Alberto (Marco Cocci) accepts the death of his father, rejects his responsibility in the family business, and regroups after losing the love of his life. Particularly poignant are the repeated scenes of the four friends standing side by side in a waterfall where they gather for nighttime meetings. They pop open champagne bottles, spraying the bubbly liquid, and scream their wildest dreams into the black night sky above. In reality, these four men want nothing more than to settle down and live peacefully. They have all begun to lay down the roots of their future lives, but they hesitate to nourish them. Through various conflicts and solutions, testing limits and making choices, they each find a new maturity and a new direction. In a way, Gabriele Muccino's THE LAST KISS is a comedy about infidelity and fear of commitment, which is really more painful than it is funny. That idea is explored thoroughly, and in the end it is resolved with difficult but realistic honesty.
