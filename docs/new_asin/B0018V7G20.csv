England 1961~ new armored truck company has the latest truck for secure money transport. The Robbery Gang finds a ""inside man"" who gives them the plans and schedule of the armored van for a share of the take. As the gang ""bashes"" open the van with a lorry and gets the loot, the result is one shot robber and one dead armored van driver. As the crooks  split the loot and escape they leave a dead gang member behind. As the robbers lay low and soon bicker and turn against each other. The ""inside"" connection robber is now under 24 hour police surveillance. Added fun is the greedy adulteress wife of one of the robbers who will do anything for cash. Billie Whitelaw is the wife of the DEAD Armored Van driver,  is soon scheming her own ""revenge"" against the gang. This is an excellent script. The photography is black and white and very well done. Acting is first rate and it holds your interest from beginning to end. Billie Whitelaw is the scene stealer here as the clever vengeance seeking widow.  5 STARS~",1491609600,,1057,4.489583333333333
