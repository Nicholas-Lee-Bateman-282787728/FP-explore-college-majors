8184843,1,B000OFORNM,"I own two shar peis and love them.  I bought this for a friend who got one and just wanted to take a look.  It is absurd, one guy, one dog filmed on maybe a hand held hd camera at best.  It is 25 minutes and not only is applicable to all dogs but borderline foolish with its points (yes we all know puppies need to go out every couple hours).  Shar peis have certain issues like shar pei fever, entropia with their eyelids and sensitive skin.  Literally none of these breed specific issues where discussed.  Additionally it gave bad information on socialization  and house breaking.  Shar peis house break in less that one week because of their obsession with being clean.

I can not emphasize what a waste of money this is.  I love this breed and this will most certainly not help a new owner.",1244246400,3,794,4.340136054421769
