4062707,2,B0032W5Z9E,"Eager for a new face in the kung fu genre, I had kept this Tod Fennel vehicle on my radar for the longest time before finally renting it, and in the aftermath, I'm just glad that I didn't buy it. ""Wushu Warrior"" is an occasionally pretty but consistently substandard effort to make a Hong Kong period piece thru European production companies. In its heart of hearts, the film wants to be a martial arts version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dances-With-Wolves/dp/B004AOECXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dances With Wolves</a>&nbsp;but ends up so bereft of its own identity that I'll be surprised if I can still remember it in a week from now.

The story: when his father is killed for interfering in the opium operation of the devious Lord Lindsey (Matt Frewer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Kids/dp/B000065V42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a>), Jonathan Elders (Fennel, 1997's ""Lassie"") - a British boy living in China during the 19th century - is raised by a group of rebels and learns the art of wushu to enact vengeance on the evil lord.

I'm not sure what medium this movie was produced for (theaters, video, TV?), but it has a curiously contained look. I'm pretty certain that the entire film comprises less than ten whole sets, and while generally nice-looking, they're all relatively small. Stylistically, the picture makes me think of a small-scale version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Dragon/dp/B000TGUUCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Dragon</a>, and instead of David Carridine, we have young Tod Fennel in the lead. Tod seems to be a good martial artist, but his screen presence leaves a lot to be desired: were it not for his singularly awful haircut, he'd be completely faceless. Then again, such is the case with most performers in the movie, the majority of which are Chinese first-timers. Veteran Matt Frewer is a rare exception, though he too isn't on top of his game: the scene wherein he intimidates and then shoots a guard (Karl Dominik,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-the-Fist/dp/B004P8R9O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of the Fist</a>) ought to have been impressive and foreboding, but because of the inauspicious script and blocking, it just looks contrived.

The martial arts content likewise ends up being pretty forgettable - not terrible, just not worth much notice. A karate practitioner in real life, Fennel gets the wushu moves down pretty good, but the choreography tends to be basic and unambitious. There's a lot less wirework than I had expected (what's there is pretty silly, though), and I appreciate how many of the five matches remain grounded, but I can't point to a single one that rises higher than numbingly average in quality; there's just not a lot of cool things going on in them. Likely realizing this, the filmmakers addressed the problem via some really laughable CGI inserts throughout. In the film's universe, martial arts seem to be synonymous with magic, and as a result, one character (Gang Zhao) is inexplicably able to teleport while Tod manages to conjure a wispy dragon which blasts Matt Frewer against a wall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Ball-Z/dp/B00D7TS972/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Ball Z</a>&nbsp;style.

On an offhand note, the film managed to surprise me with the treatment of the character played by Amber Goldfarb, taking her in a different direction than convention intended. Needless to say, this isn't enough to make the movie worth watching, and I can't recommend this to too many people. Its PG-13 rating may make it accessible to younger fu fans, but I can't think of anybody who'd genuinely appreciate this one.",1372550400,3,3907,5.873239436619718
4062708,1,B0032W5Z9E,"First, there is a reason the movie is free. It is boring, bad story line and poor fight scenes. Lastly, I cannot appreciate a martial arts movie with non-asians as the main characters, that includes Forbidden Kingdom, and I am a Chan and Li fan.",1365465600,4,245,4.466666666666667
4062709,1,B0032W5Z9E,"Another Messiah complex movie. Apparently all cultures of the world great and small need constant saving from tyranny and injustice by the Benevolent intervention of a Caucasian man. Weak plot, poor dialogue and pathetic fight choreography. Don't Bother",1316131200,4,253,5.684210526315789
4062710,2,B0032W5Z9E,"Had potential, but the fighting scenes were weak and the ending was corny.  Typical you killed my father revenge kung fu flick, but the action was only about half as good as your typical Shaw Brothers movie.  This movie is on about the same level as Dragonball Evolution.  I've seen much worse.  If you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon and feel like wasting 90 minutes, I guess watching this movie is better than watching grass grow.",1271462400,,443,4.569620253164557

4062730,2,B0032W5Z9E,"Standard story line & not very well done at that.  Only surprise was the blonde daughter of the white English evil overlord could fight pretty good, practiced herbal black magic & was just as evil as her bad dad.  (Usual formula is the daughter of the bad guy doesn't know he's bad & is good at heart herself.)  A lot of stupid choices by the white hero who was raised by the Chinese.  He's told he won't reach his great 'dragon' potential as a Wushu warrior until he lets go of the hatred in his heart & desire for revenge.  He doesn't get it & his actions cause his benevolent teacher to be poisoned & allows village to be targeted by bad guys & then tops that dumb decision off by another which gets this same teacher killed & friend captured.  And that somehow allows him to tap this dragon power & go after the bad guys!  Makes perfect sense! (Not!!)  Crashes wedding to rescue friend & get bad guys & it turns into a one-on-one hand-to-hand fight between main characters with the entire army & all other wedding guests magically disappearing.  So many holes in the ending scenes it was pathetic.  I agree with most of the other reviews, this movie wasn't very good at all.  Especially the 1 that referred to it as a soap opera w/not enough & lousy fight scenes.  I've seen worse, but I've also seen many, many better movies.",1404777600,,1330,4.383673469387755
