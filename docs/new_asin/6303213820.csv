604861,5,6303213820,"William Bendix began the part of Chester A. Riley on radio.  A role which he portrayed for years & the program was so popular that it was given the big screen treatment in 1949.  When the series made the transition to television in 1949, however, Bendix had other commitments & couldn't do the show, so another Riley was cast - Jackie Gleason.  While Jackie Gleason is a decent actor in his own right, it is William Bendix whom the character was tailor-made, so after the Gleason version was canceled after a one-season run & the powers-that-be decided to try again when Bendix became available to take the project, the show returned in 1953 to 1958 with a different cast from the 1949 version.

Tom D'andrea & Gloria Blondell as the Riley's neighbors, The Gillis', was perfect casting, there was a clear & profound chemistry between them, & the cast as a whole.  Wesley Morgan & Lugene Sanders as the the Riley's children, Junior & Babs was another good casting coup as well as Sterling Holloway as lovable scatterbrain Waldo Binney, another of the Riley's neighbors.

I've bought endless DVDs & Videos of this show via eBay merchants (most homemade concoctions), & a few commercial releases, but we do indeed need official season sets of this extraordinary series.  I've watched the episodes I have over & over again, & while some shows don't hold up well over time, I can truthfully say that this isn't one of them.  This show IS a classic.  It's clean & entertaining & you can't help but enjoy the characters.  It's a feel-good show.  It's a shame the series is rarely (if ever) seen in syndication.  In my opinion it's the best sitcom of the 1950s & has earned its kudos & praise as one of the greatest sitcoms ever broadcast.

Go to the TVShowsOnDVD website to cast your vote for season sets.  The more who request a commercial release will greatly improve the potential of this happening.

I wonder why John Brown (Digby (Digger) O'Dell)
appeared in both the radio series, the theatrical motion picture version & the first television version of Life of Riley, yet didn't return for the second series with Bendix in 1953.  Does anyone have any insight into this?

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves good, wholesome 50s family sitcoms.  Two thumbs up!! A+",1194134400,3,2269,4.70126582278481

604863,5,6303213820,"William Bendix was a great comic actor. He had been doing the role of Chester Riley on the radio since World War II and that show is still fresh. While other radio shows relied on ex-vaudeville acts to do comedy based on puns and unlikely situation comedy, LOR was doing a new type of humor - character humor. Bendix was able to do the fully developed character of Chester Riley from the first show - the bumbling, boyish, big-hearted lug. Because Bendix had looks that fit the character perfectly, the transition to television went smoothly once Bendix took over the role from the badly cast Jackie Gleason (Bendix had contractual obligations for the first two years). This is a still funny show. Why can't we have a box collection?",1070409600,10,733,4.689922480620155

604985,1,6303213820,"I am a great fan of Jackie Gleason. Having read I suspect every book written about him I do not ever remember it mentioned that he played in the TV series, ""The Life of Riley"". And after watching the Riley DVD's I can see why everybody has shied away from bringing this fact to light. Jackie seems to be going through the motions in this series as if he is just out to draw a paycheck and the acting and script shows him as a small time TV comedian. Unlike the Honeymooners, the strong belly laughs in Riley are non-existent. I will watch once and give the DVD away as I have no desire to watch again. You can see the development of many Gleason actions that will later become honed to become the Ralph Cramden and mark Jackie as the ""Great One"", which he truly was.",1397606400,,766,4.217687074829932
605026,5,6303213820,Haven't seen this show since it aired in the 1950s - great to watch Jackie pre-Honeymooners.- note that the humor is definitely from the 1950s and may be offensive to those who did not grow-up in those times.,1395878400,3,208,4.5
605027,5,6303213820,I enjoy the life of riley on dvd. This is good clean humor that if your grandparents came over and watched with you - they could very much enjoy. This show brings one back to a simpler time when tv was good. It is a shame that programs of today can not keep up with how they did this show. I do like some of the shows of today but these old ones just can not be beat. I find that when you have cable and they give you several hundred channels you still find nearly nothing to watch and then along comes out the dvd's and you get something good to watch.

605034,2,6303213820,"Being a fan of the early 1950's-60's days of television comedy I ordered this DVD on a hunch. There are signs of Jackie Gleason's genius as loveable characters (that he would showcase when he created Ralph Kramden in his Honeymooner series). The various show plots are pretty typical for the early days of television with simple conflicts that are resolved within each 30 minute session. Jackie is a loveable father character who (like in the Honeymooners series) is more of an authority figure in his mind than in reality. Rosemary DeCamp is a nice compliment as his wife and the kids play out some normal 1950's family disagreements but more often then not in a exaggerated way. Given it was filmed in 1949, the quality of the episodes are quite good however there are long gaps in-between the laughs so to me the value of the DVD is minimal. I'm not sure I'll ever get through all 26 episodes, but will still keep the DVD for more of a ""reflection of the old days"" perspective.

One caution the opening/close of each segment is absolutely painful to sit through. Apparently its supposed to be Jackie Gleason whistling the theme but unlkie the intro to the Andy Griffith show, the Life of Riley theme is without any musical accompaniment so the tune (and I'm being generous calling it that) really grates on you after a few seconds. Unless you really remember this show as being funny, my recommendation is try to find a few episodes on youtube and view those first to make sure you want to spend the 20 or so dollars to purchase. I'm not sure why this particular version was released on DVD as it doesn't compare to the Life of Riley character William Bendix created on radio.",1362960000,5,1679,4.615384615384615
605035,4,6303213820,"This is the complete 26 episode single season featuring Jackie Gleason which originally aired on the defunct DuMont Television Network.  While some reviewers have pointed out these are the cut and syndicated episodes, and it appears accurate, I doubt very much that we will ever see a fully restored, uncut release in the future.  While not restored I felt the picture and audio quality were very watchable and if you are a collector of classic TV like myself, you should not pass this one up.  This is my first purchase from TGG Direct but if their other titles are similar in quality I will be a repeat customer.  They seem to be putting out some great classic TV right now (Sea Hunt, Highway Patrol, Bat Masterson)...and the price for this 2-disc set is a bargain!

605090,1,6303213820,"When I first picked up the box, I heard a thump.  Disc 1 was loose; there were numerous scratches on its surface.  As might be expected, I was only able to watch some of the episodes before the picture froze.  I removed the disc, placed it on its hub in the box; it fit snuggly.  It is difficult to imagine how it could have come free on its own.

This funny series is about Mr. Riley, who is a good man, loves his family, has some kooky neighbors, and has a knack for getting himself into the silliest of predicaments.  Have you ever thought you knew what was going on, acted upon it, only to find out later, to your embarrassment, that you were completely wrong; his favorite phrase, as he looks into the camera: ""What a revolting development this is!""

Overall: if the ratings were just about the shows, it would be a 4 or 5; however, a bad disc warrants a rating of 1.

605095,5,6303213820,"I just purchased this collection recently and I'm so glad to see it available again on Amazon. It looks like this collection's DVDs are produced from either direct film or video tape transfers and neither video nor audio appear to have been digitally re-mastered. Despite this the majority of the episodes look extremely well. The audio is good in all episodes. William Bendix is superb in his portrayal of Chester Riley.

Life of Riley is the story of a middle class family in 1950s America. Peg, the Mother, is a stay at home Mom raising the Riley's two children Junior and Babs and taking care of the Riley household. The two children contribute to the family, respect their parents and each other. (Something you don't see on TV these days).  Despite Chester A. Riley's bumbling, fumbling and not always making the right decisions he always gets the love and support of his ""TV"" family. The Riley's next-door-neighbors and good friends Gillis and Honeybee add to the show's comic antics. This is excellent, funny family TV.

Although this is not a complete collection of all the Life of Riley episodes, I highly recommend this collection for any William Bendix, Life of Riley fan. Five stars from me for this DVD set.

7841631,5,6303213820,"When I saw this series (in reruns) as a boy, I thought it was just another marginal slapstick, I Love Lucy/Honeymooners, fare from the 1950s. Not that there's anything wrong with those two shows. But watching it again after all of these years, and seeing other episodes beyond this collection in other places, I was amazed by the storyline.

First, that the writers put Riley (played by William Bendix, who had a talent for both comedy and drama)  in southern California working for the aircraft industry. Genius. That's where the aircraft industry was in the 1950s and beyond. It would have been so much easier for them to just say that Riley worked in a factory of no certain type and have that factory placed somewhere in the Midwest.

Instead there are references throughout the series to what was actually going on in southern California at the time of the series' run: the housing crunch, the population explosion, young guys running amuck with hot rods, the rock n' roll explosion. And there's actual location shooting.

Then there is Riley's relationship with his family. Yes, he's a bit of a moron. And that's the funny part. But he is also caring and, in moments, intuitive and sensitive, as when he talks to his son about how he feels that he will never go very far in his career because he didn't go to college.

Even more, there is a progressive storyline: his daughter gets married, leaves home and has a baby. I can't think of any other sit com from this era where the ongoing plot allowed characters to realistically grow and develop.

The supporting cast is incredibly talented, including his wife Peg, played by Marjorie Reynolds; next-door neighbors Gillis and Honey Bee, played by Tom D'Andrea and Gloria Blondell, and walk-on parts by the quirky Sterling Holloway.

One final note: the performance relationship between Bendix and D'Andrea has to be one of the most comfortable in sit com history. They seemed to have fallen into a habit at some point early in the series of talking over each other, in the same way that characters did in ""Citizen Kane"" and just as real people do in real life.
