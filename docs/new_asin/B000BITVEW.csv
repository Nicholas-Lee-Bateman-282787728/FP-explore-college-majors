8324246,2,B000BITVEW,"I bought this movie for Demons In My Head. I saw it for rent back in the 90s, now in 2013 I decided to finally buy it and watch it, and it was cheaper buying it in this combo. All the reviews are going on and on about To Become One, which was less than terrible. Same story with Demons In My Head. I love B movies, and I knew what I was going into with buying this because I have watched most of Brain Damage Films (most of which are awful). Don't bother with either of these, they are both slow, boring, and crappy. The only Brain Damage Film worth watching is Terror Toons.",1361491200,,575,4.008695652173913
8324247,2,B000BITVEW,"A Neil Johnson two pack. I haven't been this excited since my root canal.

DEMONS IN MY HEAD: The movie has its moments of genius and some very sad moments too. The opening credits seemed to have been very well done with the appearance that this would be a first rate horror movie, but the credit technique didn't match the film. One of the problems with the credits is that it had only 2 names (or so it seemed) that of Neil Johnson and Jane Rowland. The SF special effects were great, the horror special effects were stinkers.

The movie is based on pop pseudo-science popularized by ""The 12th Planet"" (that guy is actually still around pushing this nonsense... oh wait ""Prometheus""). In this film, the ancient Nephilim send a meteor to earth with a device inside that does a lot of tele-creating/ transporting stuff. The movie spends excessive amount of time with characters. There are 3 people who share a house. Travis Brown is a regular guy. Regis is a gay guy who wants Travis. Travis wants Marcia, a model who lives there also. Marcia would rather date Travis' HS rival. There is also a Christian couple involved, one of which is a guy whose stutter was overdone until it was stupid.

Better than most Brain Damaged films and it would be interesting to see what Neil could do with a budget. Certainly this is better than Peter Jackson's first film.

F-bomb, sex, nudity?

TO BECOME ONE: The problem with this movie is that the title and description give too much away. The movie is a who-dun-it slasher, but we know who-dun-it from the description. Neil Johnson, as usual did a fine job with the credit roll. The soundtrack was fairly good and this time he had some people (mostly women) who can act in his film, unfortunately he keeps giving rolls to his buddies who can't act. Also Neil should consider having someone look at his script before he makes a movie from it. This one had potential as a slasher in a gas mask (okay its been done before) but as a ""Basket Case"" film it didn't hack it. The twist was simply stupid.",1341187200,,2033,4.528610354223433
8324248,4,B000BITVEW,I don't know what to rate these films.  The To Become One film gav e me errie dreams about stufff and I don't know what to think about that. Maybe these are good films but i have lost my outlook on life at the moment. Creepy stuff.,1143244800,,231,3.9148936170212765
8324249,5,B000BITVEW,"Finally definitive versions of these 2 amazing films.  Despite the listings these are both anamorphic widescreen versions with heaps of bonus materials on both discs.  Well worth the price.  The behind the scenes for To Become One are pretty amazing.  What they filmakers went through to make the film must be seen to be believed.  And check out the 911 similarities to Demons in My Head.  Worthy of your attention.  I will not say more, so not to spoil the fun",1143158400,2,461,4.617283950617284
