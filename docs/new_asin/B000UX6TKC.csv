2926575,5,B000UX6TKC,"This great series is finally available on DVD collections by seasons. ""The Wild, Wild West"" was one of the last successful Western television shows, coming on right as the era of the great Western TV show was coming to an end.

Its success was due to the fact that not only was it exciting and action-packed, but it was a curious meld of traditional Western action, espionage, science fiction, and high camp. It was in equal parts a product of its time as a Western, such as ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Bonanza,"" a semi-serious, lots of camp spy show like ""I-Spy,"" ""The Man From UNCLE,"" and ""The Avengers,"" science fiction like ""Star Trek"" and ""Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea,"" and sophomoric camp like ""Batman."" Robert Conrad and Ross Martin made a formidable team as US Secret Service agents James West and Artemis Gordon, as they travelled all over the West in their personal locomotive thwarting the schemes and intrigues of power-mad scientists and ruthless governments.

This show is near and dear to a lot of us who grew up in the mid to late 60's, and it is a joy to watch these episodes and remember that while the world was not a simple, carefree place, our living rooms could be while watching shows like ""The Wild, Wild West.""",1187913600,34,1227,4.598173515981735

Artemus Gordon is fun to watch with all the disguises he comes up with and the humor he brings to the show.  James West is fun to watch more for his athletic fight scenes that border on gymnastics at times.  Good story lines that are fast paced and exciting will keep you wanting to watch the next episode.",1404864000,2,571,4.471153846153846
2926640,4,B000UX6TKC,"I must confess that I purchased this ""complete third season"" simply to acquire a replacement for a flawed disc that had come with the complete series boxed set I had purchased previously. (A previous experience with ""one bad disc from a boxed set"" had completely soured me on the whole process of attempting to get a replacement  and this is no reflection on Amazon at all, they have always been quite helpful with replacement issues.) Thankfully, disc 4 of season 3 from this set was in perfect shape! But if you're going to watch ""The Wild Wild West"", you should really do it from black-and-white start to glorious full color finish; it's the perfect blend of action, late-sixties sexiness, the American west, and the British spy drama. Yes, the material is dated, the sets are recycled, the plots are retreads . . . but the awful 1999 movie can't hold a candle to the original. ""The Wild Wild West"" is just plain fun!",1397779200,4,920,4.644171779141105
2926641,3,B000UX6TKC,"If you want a run of the mill western then you probably won't like this show, but if you want a show that is fun and has some good action for the time period this is good show.

2926645,5,B000UX6TKC,"I purchased this season because it contained an episode with Robert Duvall, The Night of the Falcon.

2926657,5,B000UX6TKC,"The Wild Wild West 3rd Season is full of great villains, including Sean O'Reilley, played by Pernell Roberts in ""The Night of the Firebrand"" and one appearance of Dr. Loveless in ""The Night Dr. Loveless Died,"" who is played by Michael Dunn. This season has several suspenseful and dramatic episodes, such as ""The Night of the Simian Terror,"" in which Jim and Artie visit the plantation of a U.S. Senator who has a mysterious family past, ""The Night of the Amnesiac,"" where Jim loses his memory while trying to deliver an essential vaccine for small pox, and ""The Night of the Death Masks,"" where an escaped murderer named Emmett Stark sends Jim to a deserted town named Paradox in an insane plan to get revenge. The quality of the DVDs are beautifully clear, and the fight scenes are realistic as ever. The 3rd season also has ""The Night of the Undead,"" which has the most fight scenes than any other episode of the series, a grand total of seven, and ""The Night of the Iron Fist,"" which has the most amount of film of Jim and Artie's train, both inside and out. I'd highly recommend this season of The Wild Wild West to everyone who loves classic westerns.",1369180800,,1157,4.5673076923076925

2926664,3,B000UX6TKC,"I have the First 2 Volumes which brought back many memories, but this third season moves away from the style I remember and into a more straight forward for the most part, who takes over the world.  There is only 1 Dr. Loveless episode and even it does not have the snap that earlier episodes had.  The Five through eight episodes are better, especially about the gold and the incas. There are no special or extra features and the number of episodes drop from 28 to 24.

I put some of this to Bruce Lansbury taking over the Producing. Something drops from the series - and it was with this Season that the violence streak increased and groups started calling for it to be cancelled. I recommend it for heavy fans, but for those that really want to know what this series was like.  stick with Volumes 1 and 2.",1343260800,,808,4.366666666666666
2926665,5,B000UX6TKC,"As a member of the orginial series viewer, it was wonderful to relive those episodes.  I will rate all seasons the same. The only negative is regarding the voice of Robert Conrad.  His voice sounds so high that it is scary. His intros of each episode does not sound like the James West that you hear in each episode.  However, by the entire series.  It is trip down memory lane and is wonderful.",1342137600,,395,4.36986301369863

2926668,4,B000UX6TKC,"The third season of ""The Wild, Wild West"" aired from September 1967 to February 1968.  The United States was changing rapidly.  Westerns remained popular, but a mixture of offbeat television shows, comedies and variety shows was steadily supplanting westerns.  ""The Wild, Wild West"" bridged the old and the new, taking elements of modern shows and mixing them in with what seemed to be a western on its face.  While there were numerous anachronisms, the show worked and capitalized on the popularity of other popular shows, though the result was often campy.

By the third season, ""The Wild, Wild West"" formula was established.  The average episode featured two fight scenes with James Tiberius West (Robert Conrad) usually winning the day.  Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) would introduce a neat gadget, appear in disguise, or both, in each episode.  The enemy of the week required a combination of James West's physical and strategic capabilities with Artemus's brains to win the day.  Of course, there was always an element of fortuitous luck and the never-failing arrogance of the enemy to count on as well.

There were only 24 episodes in this season, versus 28 in the previous season.  For better or worse, some of these episodes were close to being hilarious.  For example, Robert Duvall dressed up in costume as the madman-of-the-week ready to wreak havoc on Denver with a super weapon.  In another episode, a person in a gorilla suit was running around, apparently killing people a la ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue.""  There are other episodes with other levels of humor.

In the midst of the camp came some marvelous episodes.  In ""The Night of the Jack of Diamonds,"" James West meets a former revolutionary.  The pair came to respect each other during one of the best episodes of the season.  This episode shows how much more potential ""The Wild, Wild West"" had.  There were other highlights, such as Ed Asner as an evil genius trying to (what else) wreak havoc on the world.  In this episode, James West lost his memory and was little help until the end.

Part of the ""Wild, Wild West"" formula was the appearance of the stars of the era, many of whom remain famous today.  I already mentioned a couple above.  Other stars included Richard Kiel, who would soon become famous for his role as Jaws in several movies; Roosevelt ""Rosie"" Greer, a former professional football player; Nehemiah Persoff;  Nick Adams, who was quite well known for his starring role in ""The Rebel"" as well as appearances in many other television shows and movies; Mark Lenard, who achieved much greater fame as Spock's father; John McGiver, a very well known actor with appearances in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" and dozens more; and so many more stars that I could finish this review by listing them all.

As with the previous season, I noticed that the colors seemed almost phenomenally bright.  When I watch modern westerns, one of the things I notice is that the colors are generally drab.  Of course, the color of the west was generally drab rather than bright blue (or yellow, or green, or purple, for that matter).  The word that comes to mind once again is anachronism.

I pointed out in my review of season 2 that ""Wild, Wild West"" was becoming formulaic.  This season the formula added James West taking his shirt off frequently.  I wonder whether that was supposed to encourage women to watch the show.

As with the previous season, I seemed to notice sets much more.  It is funny to watch a scene and realize that the background through an open door is a painting.  I have also become a bit more critical of the special effects, which seemed to get reused much more, perhaps to save money.

As with season two, there are no extras.

""Wild Wild West"" has joined the array of television shows that have become classic television.  The show was inspired and creative.  The show used its unique premise to come up with plots that few other shows could encompass.  Though I have my criticisms of the show, I still enjoy watching every episode and I forward to watching them again, along with seasons one, two and four.  This show remains a fun one to watch and well worth every penny.

Enjoy!",1312243200,,4226,4.789764868603043
2926669,4,B000UX6TKC,I truly enjoyed watching The Wild Wild West-The Third Season. In fact I grew up while watching the series. This is the fourth time I am watching the series.

2926671,5,B000UX6TKC,"The Night Of The Simian Terror on Disc 6 is my favorite Wild Wild West episode.  All of the actors are great for their characters: 7-foot Richard Kiel as the outcast son, beautiful Grace Gaynor as the adopted daughter, Dabbs Greer as the troubled Senator, John Abbott as the German scientist whose culture education experiment with a gorilla did not work out as planned, and H.M. Wynant as the determined leader son.  The various elements are also great: the windy nights, the bent metal bars of the estate fence, the ringing church bell, mysterious killings in the night, and an unknown missing person.  Also great is the grave atypical ending with the Senator holding his fallen son and saying reflectively, ""What did I do to him....What did I do....""",1284076800,4,753,4.821705426356589
2926672,5,B000UX6TKC,"This is the season where the series toned things down a bit.  The villians and their methods are less Steampunk in nature.  Fate also has a hand in this season not being on par with the early ones as health problems limited Dunn (Loveless) to only one episode this season and a near the season end injury of Robert Conrad (who was still doing most of his own stunts) cut the season short.

That said it is still fun romp but is it missing that special ""something"" that made Wild Wild West what it was thought on occasion it does recapture that spark.  To someone not familiar with the series I would recommend season two over this season and then getting this season and this is a minor step down.",1279324800,2,697,4.338461538461538

2926696,3,B000UX6TKC,"""The Wild Wild West"" is one of those TV shows from the late 1960ies what would have been quite forgotten by all but fans save for an ill-fated attempt at making a movie from it, a movie which spent a great deal of money on the star-power and special effects and proved resoundingly that plenty of each do not come anywhere near assuring a hit.

The original series aired from 1965-69, and was a cheerful amalgam of  the Old West with James Bond gadgets spliced together with lashings of Batmanesque camp thrown in for good measure. The debonair secret service agent James T. West (Robert Conrad) and his partner Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) the master of disguise and accents, roamed the American frontier in their luxurious private train, foiling the devilish plots of various megalomaniacal villains. They did so with panache and considerable charm - and an almost complete lack of period authenticity, to the point where this set would make a wonderful drinking game for 19th century re-enactors; simply down a drink every time there is an out-of period anachronism of any sort:  I guarantee everyone would be hammered by about an episode and a half.

But still and all, the show does have a certain nostalgic charm of its own, at this point. It's a relic of an earlier television age, when it was perfectly OK to shoot on the same old familiar back-lot, or take the crew out to do exterior shots in Griffith Park, and never mind that there is a telephone pole right there between the pine trees and the back of a warehouse, too. Or that the window through which a fist-fight crashes is boarded up with very obvious balsawood planks, the breakaway barrel is completely empty and made of balsa-wood too, and that whoever dressed the set just pulled oddments out of a prop warehouse someplace: the same objects kept showing up, time and time again. And the extras stand around in the background uncertainly waiting further direction - but the viewer can count on Robert Conrad getting into a fist-fight (he did all his own stunts) and possibly removing his shirt, which he did oftener than William Shatner did on Star Trek. The threshold of believable authenticity in a weekly show was, needless to say, appreciably lower forty years ago.  The budget for the movie remake of The Wild Wild West probably equaled the budget for season or more of the TV show, but the original is far, far more amusing.

In great anticipation I watch each episode to see just what new character this great actor will come up with. I have yet to be disappointed.  Robert Conrad does his own stunts and is in great shape.

For all the criticism we can heap on it, at least that turkey renewed interest in this great TV series from the 1960s so that it's now available on DVD. Otherwise it might've been forever lost and forgotten. Wild Wild West has to be the most fun TV show of all time and Season 3 might be the most enjoyable of the whole collection. Sure, the directing got a little sloppy. But it just adds to the fun seeing Robert Conrad with a Jack Lord hairstyle in one scene, and then a modified Beatle haircut in the next. Or when he swims underwater and then surfaces with bone-dry hair. (The Night of the Turncoat).

My favorite episode is Firebrand. Jim and Artemus have to use all their muscle and guile to stop a revolutionary named O'Reilly played by Pernell Roberts from taking over Canada. It's worth watching just to see a very beautiful Lana Wood as Vixen. And the bloopers continue. As O'Reilly and his men leave that doomed fort and ride out the gate, far off in the distance a car is seen driving by. (Heh heh heh...I love it.)

Wild Wild West reflects the mid-1960s well. At that time the old Batman series was setting new low standards for programming and was being handsomely rewarded with sky high ratings. But even the worst programs of the 60s were more entertaining than what's offered today. Despite all our digital technology and hi definition TV a whole generation has been reduced to watching people singing off key and being insulted by judges. Well now you actually have something worth watching on that magnificent big screen. Check out Wild Wild West Season 3 and join the fun.",1209945600,5,1632,4.566552901023891

2926706,4,B000UX6TKC,"The third season of ""The Wild Wild West"" (1967-68) was the most Western-oriented due to budgetary constraints. Though the bizarre fantasies were curtailed, Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon encountered challenging adventures such as ""The Night of the Bubbling Death,"" ""The Night of the Jack O'Diamonds"" and ""The Night of the Falcon"" (featuring Robert Duvall as a guest villain). Michael Dunn's return in ""The Night Dr. Loveless Died"" was a definite highlight and the last memorable Loveless episode. Season Three had its share of clunkers  ""The Night of the Firebrand"" and ""The Night of the Arrow"" come to mind  yet the unique chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin always made the series worth watching.",1208822400,25,731,5.239316239316239

2926709,5,B000UX6TKC,"This particular season features some significant developments. First of all Jim West has now become almost impossible to defeat in a fight. He even takes on the boxing champ in one of these shows! However, he can be knocked out by any female who smiles while slipping a mickey in his drink. You would think after several ""Lost Weekends"" in this manner he would refuse ANY drink from a beautiful lady!  He also gets shot very well placed in the leg in two of these episodes, and Artemus Gordon joins him in the final one with a leg shot of his own. Artemus develops more of a ""French"" attitude in dinner engagements with beautiful women and characters of French origin. Season 3 also had better music for action scenes and there is a lot of stagecoach riding, dynamite use, and travel to big and small towns. New Orleans is even in this one as Mardi Gras is in full swing and West is ""Don Juan"" with Arte' as ""Hamlet"". Watch what happens to Arte's ""Hamlet"" skull of Yurick!
The DVD transfer is good and the season is very colorful, in fact I would say an improvement over the last few seasons. Where else can you find the ""Paradox Hotel"", ""Balm in Gilead Mortuary"", etc.
The only drawback is one Dr. Loveless adventure, but Jim West was and is always the dominant personality and there is a lot of action. Including an attempted assassination of President Grant. The President is featured in more than one episode and Jim and Arte' receive most of their assignments from a Colonel in charge out West. Very entertaining as usual and good plotting.

I just caught the ""Montezuma's Horde"" episode (Season 3) last night and was almost embarrassed by the cheapness and historically inaccuracy of it all. It almost had a ""Batman"" (campy 60s TV version) feel to it.  I realize this show isn't a documentary of the real west, but does ANYONE believe that Arty could stand to wear a fake beard and wig for days on end in a hot desert?  And what kind of glue could POSSIBLY allow such items to adhere to the skin for that long under those conditions?  And what about the ""solid jade"" restraining devices in the temple that are clearly nothing more than painted wood?

The story lines were far better authored from a storytelling perspective and James West (the ladies man) became an even bigger superman type character in the Wild Wild West. Artemus Gordon even grew into an even bigger persona as a character. In fact you can really see the comradeship between the actors and cast.

We had some memorable guest stars including Michael Dunn (Dr. Loveless), Robert Duvall and Nick Adams.

Season four is tentatively set for March 18, 2008.

The episodes include:

Disc 1 & 2
The Night of the Bubbling Death
The Night of the Firebrand
The Night of the Assassin
The Night Dr. Loveless Died
The Night of Jack O' Diamonds
The Night of the Samurai
The Night of the Hangman
The Night of Montezuma's Hordes

Disc 3 & 4
The Night of the Circus of Death
The Night of the Falcon (featuring Robert Duvall)
The Night of the Cut-Throats
The Night of the Legion of Death
The Night of the Turn Coat
The Night of the Iron Fist
The Night of the Running Death
The Night of the Arrow

Disc 5 & 6
The Night of the Headless Woman
The Night of the Vipers (with guest star Nick Adams)
The Night of the Underground Terror
The Night of the Death Masks (one of my favs)
The Night of the Amnesiac
The Night of the Undead (involving voodoo)
The Night of the Simian Terror (with a witty reference to Edgar Allen Poe)
The Night of the Death Maker

The third season had less episodes as well 24 compared to the 28 for seasons one and two. The show's level of action sequences--which had always been high--reached a peak during season three which put the show on the radar for a group that protested the level of violence in the show. The result was that with middling ratings and conflict over the high level of action in the show, ""The Wild Wild West"" was not renewed after the fourth season.

This set comes without extras although the show looks terrific. It would have been nice to have a featurette on the show's production. At least we get a terrific looking presentation for the show.",1196121600,38,2076,4.433070866141732

2926733,5,B000UX6TKC,"The action adventure series to end them all.  Even four decades later it still sets the standard for action and high adventure.  Robert Conrad's stuntwork on the show was legendary (which is probaby why he was the only actor ever inducted into the Stuntman's Hall of Fame).  Ross Martin was the perfect partner.  With Season 3 Dick Cangey (a former boxer) joined Conrad's stock stunt team (including Red West) and got Conrad to change his fighting technique.  This season also features a young Robert Duvall as a villain! Nothing is perfect.  Watch closely at the scenes in Night of the Turncoat where Conrad is in a tank and in plain sight in one shot is a man in black scuba gear!  You'll also notice from time to time his hair style changes.  This resulted from a halt in production when he was seriously injuried on a stunt ( he fell some twenty feet from a chandalier and hit a concrete floor).  Look closely at the fights and you will most of the same guys over and over -- Whitie Hughes, Red West, Dick Cangey: Conrad's personal stunt crew for the show.  This would be the last really decent season.  Season four was the victim of an anti-violence crusade in the aftermath the King and Kennedy assassinations. The fight scenes would suffer to the point of looking ludicrus. Also Ross Martin suffered a heart attack and is missing in parts of season 3 & 4.",1192492800,7,1362,4.540983606557377

Poe's ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", guest starring Richard ""Voltaire"" Kiel). Warning, there's only one Dr. Loveless' offering: ""The Night Dr. Loveless Died"".

8215489,4,B000UX6TKC,"By 1967 this popular, escapist series from television's silver age maintained its essential character but simmered down into something less expensive and more formulaic than how it began. This was due to the vision of a new producer, Bruce Lansbury (Angela's brother), who ran the show longer than anyone else. Lansbury steered the series away from creator Michael Garrison's fabulous fantasy into a western that, while unconventional, was less Victorian and more sagebrush. Lansbury also set the mold that would remain constant in the series' last two years: two charactersone, an athletic type, busting down the doors; the other, a comedian, using guile through disguise and dialectswho moved in different directions to solve a common problem. In its third season most of those problems had become tamer than in seasons past, though there are exceptions: first instance, ""The Night of the Falcon,"" in which lead heavy Robert Duvall assembles a cadre of international criminals to auction off an enormous, rococo cannon. Fan favorites from this season include its opener, ""The Night of the Bubbling Death,"" a ""Mission: Impossible"" caper; ""The Night of Jack O'Diamonds,"" a fairly pedestrian story that's elevated by its production values (location shooting that simulated a movie western more closely than any other episode of the series) and lush music (by Richard Markowitz, who composed the series' memorable theme); and ""The Night of the Death Masks,"" a near remake of a first-season episode in which a baddie with a grudge nearly tricks the series' two sidekicks into exterminating each other. Michael Dunn makes one return this season as the inimitable Dr. Loveless. All too wild in 1967-68 were this season's elaborate, choreographed fight scenes: one so dangerous that Robert Conrad took an unplanned fall that nearly broke his neck. Near the season's end that accident shut down production four weeks earlier than planned. Five months later, Conrad was back in action, more tightly tethered by CBS. The notorious episode (""The Night of the Fugitives"") was completed for screening in Season Fourincluding footage of the near catastrophe.",1506124800,2,2145,5.330383480825959
