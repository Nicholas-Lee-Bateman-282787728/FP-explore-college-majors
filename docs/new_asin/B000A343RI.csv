2355475,1,B000A343RI,"You ain't gonna like it, but it needs to be said.

This is dispicable.

Two spoiled celebrity bitches go at it in a hackneyed comedy which milks the raw and bloody udder of the evil in-law, shamelessly coming along on the tail of Meet the Fockers.

J-Lo is a pretentious egomaniac who is all juicy ass and no talent, all image and no substance. Her hollow music and miserable acting makes me convulse. Doesn't anyone remember Gili? Lopez should not belowed in films anymore just for that alone.

And Jane Fonda?

How much more can this bitch disgrace her father's legacy? Henry Fonda was amazing and even Peter had his moments.

But Jane really sucks.

The only thing she was ever good at was stabbing her country in the back during Nam. I'm not a right-wing flag waver, but still, this woman went too far. I grew up near a VFW and always enjoyed urinating on her picture in the urinal with the target on it. The woman was a traitor! She should be expelled from popular entertainment!

Paying to see this movie is about the same as wiping your butt with the American flag. You'd also be telling Hollywood that your intellegence is not insulted by such inane crap. I mean really, it's like they think we're stupid, throwing this at us and calling it a movie. The nerve!

I gotta go now.

I'm gonna be sick.",1115942400,5,1305,4.445378151260504
2355476,4,B000A343RI,"I saw this at the premiere in Atlanta a couple weeks ago. Jane Fonda was there, and so was Jennifer Lopez.

Since it was Jane's big comeback, though, and it was her charity's fundraiser, she sat and watched the whole movie. Thank God she was there, though, because her scenery-chewing, over-the-damn-top, broadly comic performance is HILARIOUS.

My mom said herself, ""I never much agreed with her politics, but Jane Fonda is a GREAT actress. That was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and she should get an Oscar for it. She stole that whole movie. And I liked J-Lo, too. I thought she was sweet.""

Maybe it was because I was in a good crowd (which I understand can influence the experience), but ""Monster-in-Law"" came off as a really, really funny movie. There were about a dozen laugh-out-loud moments, and it's the best Jennifer Lopez movie I've seen in a long time. And you get more fight scenes (real and imagined) than I thought possible. And Wanda Sykes, though her asides were planted a few times too many, has great delivery. Michael Vartan, sadly, doesn't get much to do besides look really good.

Mom walked out of the theater and called the whole experience a blast.",1115942400,6,1193,4.639810426540285
2355477,3,B000A343RI,"MONSTER IN LAW represents Jane Fonda's return to the movies for the first time in fifteen years.  The role is a genuine departure for her, for she plays an aging TV host and mother who has lost her job and is losing her son to Jennifer Lopez in marriage.  She was fifty-two at the time of her previous film, so this is the first time on screen where playing an older woman has arisen.  So, how did Jane do?  First, anyone would have to grant that she is aging with grace.  Yes, she looks older, but she has also obviously worked hard at taking care of herself, and I only pray that when I reach her age I am even remotely in as good a shape as she is now.  Unfortunately, I am not sure that the role was completely appropriate for her.  She basically has to play an extraordinarily shallow, selfish, self-absorbed jerk, and though she throws herself into this wholeheartedly, she isn't completely believable.  Nonetheless, there are still a host of very funny scenes, and while the part might not be perfect for her, it certainly wasn't an utter mistake.

The real problem with the movie is that it is utterly predictable.  Before it starts, you know pretty much everything that is going to happen.  You know that it will start off at Point A and end up at Point Z, the only question being some of the variations along the way.  There is nothing necessarily bad about being predictable, as long as one makes up for it by being creative within that framework.  And indeed many of the jokes here are quite funny, and there are a number of nice moments.  However, almost all of the key transitions are rather tired and true.  By the end of the film, the viewer is left with the distinct impression of having seen it all before.

Jennifer Lopez has one of the most negative public images of any actor or actress in America, but however she might be as a person face to face, I have always like her film persona.  She projects as a very sweet, very nice individual on screen, and one of the regrets I have had about her career is that she hasn't made enough films like THE WEDDING PLANNER and MAID IN MANHATTAN.  This isn't as good a movie as either of those films, but as in those I enjoyed the moments she appears on screen.  I very much regretted, on the other hand, the relatively small amount of time that Michael Vartan had in the film.  I was worried that I was going to have trouble accepting him in the film, being a big fan of ALIAS.  I wasn't sure that I could accept him as anyone except Vaughan, but it turned out to be remarkably easy to do so.  It would have been hard in a film structured around Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda squaring off, but I wish he had had a larger role, even though he was third billed as it was.  The other major presence in the film-and a highly welcome one-was stand up comedienne Wanda Sykes as Ruby, Jane Fonda's assistant.  She if a fundamentally funny person, and is delightful in delivering her lines whether they are strictly funny or not.

All in all, this is a fine comedy as long as one keeps one's expectations somewhat muted.  After I saw it at a preview, I replied to friends who asked about it, ""I'd wait for it on DVD.""  I think that is about right.  It is a pleasant film, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to see a film in a theater.  For that, there are probably better options.

On a side note for those interested in celebrity gossip (and come on, even Franklin Delano Roosevelt delighted in it) should take note the irony of having Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan teamed together as a romantic couple in a film.  Jennifer Lopez was, of course, famously linked with Ben Affleck, who went on after the breaking off of their engagement to become involved with Jennifer Garner, who was involved with Michael Vartan shortly before dating Affleck.",1115942400,23,3818,4.396011396011396

2355487,3,B000A343RI,"Review for Monster-in-Law
Hot Toasty Rag, September 29, 2017

After a fifteen-year retirement, Jane Fonda came back to Hollywood and starred in Monster-in-Law, a comedy about an overbearing mother who tries to interfere with her sons impending marriage because she feels his fianc isn't good enough for him. Or, if you look at it another way, a loving mother feels her handsome doctor son could do better than a flaky, part-time dog walker, and she tries to help him come to his senses before they're married.

Michael Vartan plays Janes son, and Jennifer Lopez is the impending daughter-in-law. All three are perfectly cast in their roles: Michael is weak, easily swayed, but sincere; Jenny is sweet but strong; and Jane is impeccable, uptight, and a force to be reckoned with. While it might be a bit of a shock for audiences who last saw Jane as a romantic lead in Stanley & Iris in 1990, she doesnt take the role as the mother-in-law to say, Im an old lady now. Shes beautiful, vibrant, and able to compete toe-to-toe with the icon JLo. Jane even films a scene in her negligee; its clear to her audience that shes nowhere near old age.

As to the movie itself, its very entertaining and funny. Wanda Sykes costars as Janes assistant and friend, and while everything out her mouth is supposed to a sarcastic aside to make the audience laugh, nothing she says is very funny. Jane and Jenny are the funny ones, and its so easy to root for both of them, youll find yourself changing sides every time you watch it! Keep a lookout for Elaine Stritch, Adam Scott, Monet Mazur and Will Arnett in smaller but memorable parts. This is a great movie to watch with your girlfriends or your momor if you have a great relationship with her, your mother-in-law. Pop the corn and champagne and get ready to giggle the night away.",1506643200,,1817,4.6191950464396285

2355500,5,B000A343RI,"OMG.  If you have not seen this movie you need to. This movie is hysterical and so funny to watch.  Jlo and Jane fonda knock the plot right out of the park.  If you have problems with in laws this movie will keep you on your toes. However, don't resort to the revengeful ways Jane fonda does.  I would say Jlo who plays charlie does excellent in handling her mother in law, but has a hard time getting there and has to constantly compete with her childish controlling ways of her son.  It would make enough for any bride to be to become a runaway bride.  But to get to the ending you will just have to watch this movie.",1492732800,3,619,4.116666666666666

2355502,3,B000A343RI,"Poor writing.

I very much enjoyed seeing Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda in the same movie.  Personally Jane never impressed me when she was young, but she has aged exceptionally well.  I've never seen her look better than in a few of the scenes in this movie.  Her strength as a mature woman is undeniable.

Jennifer Lopez is an amazing, multi-talented woman and her character in this movie reflected some of that.  Basically a very upbeat and energetic person with a lot of inner strength and integrity.

The problem  Jane's character is so over done.  Not even close to realistic.  Marie in Everybody Loves Raymond was a believable Monster-in Law.  Viola in this movie was just crazy and unstable.

The male lead was just vanilla and that would have been OK if Jane's character was more realistic.",1491868800,,799,4.751824817518248

2355831,3,B000A343RI,"I don't like Jane Fonda because of her political views. However, there is no doubt that she is a talented actress and in this lightweight farce, she pretty much is the show.

  Fonda, an aging Barbara Walters TV personality type, is set out to pasture for being too old - and too crazy. Her sendup of a vapid talking head interviewing an even more vapid Britney Spears kind of pop tart is absolutely hilarious.

  Fonda's son, Michael Vartan has found the girl of his dreams, played by Jennifer Lopez. Both Vartan and Lopez both get billing over Fonda, but their performances are lightweight.

  Fonda, as the potential mother-in-law doesn't want her son to marry and sets out to derail the marriage.

  Her attempts are hilarious and much of the script focuses on good comedy and not a little slapstick. Wanda Syke's plays Fonda's long suffering assistant. She's good, but the character isn't all that believable. Of course, that is true for all the characters.

  Anyway, Fonda and Lopez engage in an all-out war and get a lot of laughs in the process.

  This movie is strictly for fun. It has no message. Just lean back, munch some popcorn and enjoy, particularly Fonda's performance.

2355837,4,B000A343RI,Monster-in-law is just a light hearted comedy. I read a few of the other reviews and they sound like they are trying to find some kind of deep meaning within a comedy. No you're not always going to fall down on the floor laughing but its still a cute movie with a nice ending. Is it completely 100% realistic? No but how many comedies are out there that people love to death that are more worthy of receiving one star than this movie. The cast had great chemistry and you can tell that they all truly had a good time making this movie just as I had a good time watching it.,1209254400,,573,4.125
2355838,3,B000A343RI,"When I first saw `Monster-in-Law' I loved it.  There is just something so charming about Jennifer Lopez.  She's not the greatest actress around but she has this charisma, this endearing quality that makes her films so much fun.  Add to that Wanda Sykes who is just always hysterical and of course there was the return of the Fonda and you had this movie that was just wildly entertaining.  It wasn't until my third or fourth watch through that I realized this movie is extremely clich&eacute;d and predictable.

Regardless though; it's still a lot of fun.

The film revolves around Charlie, a young and vivacious woman who never wants to live the same day twice.  She has a slew of temp jobs that keep her busy, almost too busy.  Then she meets Dr. Kevin Fields, a young handsome man who is drawn to Charlie's personality (and she aint half bad to look at either) and soon they fall fast in love.  There is only one problem; Kevin's mother.  Viola Fields is high strung and demanding; controlling and aggressive.  These qualities manifest themselves full throttle when Kevin proposes to Charlie.  In Viola's eyes, Charlie will never be good enough for her son, and so she makes it her goal to destroy their relationship.

There are some really funny moments, especially when Viola and Charlie are sparring off with one another; but there are also quite a few familiar sequences that seem redundant.  Wanda Sykes is funny, but not as funny as she can be.  She has a few great scenes, but she actually gets overshadowed a lot by Fonda's theatrics.  Fonda is golden, truly comedic gold there.  Lopez is charming and sweet and proves to be a good match for Fonda, but yet again she is often overshadowed.  I don't know why Michael Vartan is even in this movie.  He's not very memorable.  Adam Scott is quick witted and memorable and Elaine Stritch has a great moment near the end of the film.

All in all `Monster-in-Law' doesn't have the `monster' sized laughs but it does have quite a few decent sized chuckles and it's charming, which is consistent with just about everything Lopez stamps her name on.  If you enjoy her other films like `The Wedding Planner' or `Maid in Manhattan' then you'll surely enjoy `Monster-in-Law'.",1208217600,3,2223,4.71948051948052
2355839,1,B000A343RI,"Mothers-in-law. They can be a woman's best friend, or her most lethal enemy.

When the subject comes up, I always remember the tale of a young man whose mom spent his wedding loudly shouting that they would be divorced in six months, set up a fund for their divorce, and other endearing actions. I imagine that woman was a bit like Jane Fonda's unspeakably catty character in the limp ""Monster-in-Law.""

To some degree, ""Monster-in-Law"" isn't a romantic comedy movie. It's an overlong sitcom episode.

Charlie (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog-walker whose dreams are about to come true -- she's engaged to Kevin (Michael Vartan), a sweet and hunky doctor. There's only one small problem: Viola (Jane Fonda), Kevin's strong-willed mumsie, doesn't think that Charlie is right for her perfect son.

So Viola does the only thing she can think of -- she starts pranking Charlie, hoping to drive the unworthy future-in-law away. Poisoned food, ripped dresses, wedding disasters and slap fighting all ensue, but soon Charlie gets sick of it and begins to fight back. Who will win, the desperate fiancee or the force-of-nature mom?

Yeah, it's not much of a plot. I kept waiting for the laugh track to kick in, and a preview for next week's episode.

In fact, the plotlessness is what really hurts ""Monster-in-Law."" Once Charlie and Viola are introduced, the entire film descends into a series of pranks, which in turn are dropped in favor of warm'n'fuzzy ""aw, what hardships you've had."" Slapstick ones too -- if Robert Luketic had taken the P.G. Wodehouse route of elaborate pranking, it might have worked. But watching Fonda and Lopez going bonkers at each other isn't very funny.

It doesn't help that the screenplay is as limp as the plotting. Poor Vartan is forced to spout endless romance-novel cheez, which is more likely to induce vomiting than thrills -- ""What are you doing the rest of your life?"". And alas, innocent moviegoers are forced to endure yet more tributes to Lopez's much-hyped posterior, which probably has a stylist and trailer all its own.

Jennifer Lopez is the kiss of death to romantic comedies -- there's nothing very funny about her face, her body, or her way of delivering lines. And to be honest, Vartan doesn't fit in this movie any better -- he looks rather confused, as if he isn't sure how he ended up in this particular film. Not to mention a bit overwhelmed by the catfighting.

The saving graces? Fonda has wild, hilarious manic energy that overcomes the thinness of her role, and makes her quite fun to watch. And Wanda Sykes, as her P.A., gets the best lines of the whole movie. When the two of them are on the screen together, they're pure hilarity. In fact, forget Lopez -- make the movie about Wanda and Jane, and you've got a hit.

Cheesy dialogue and no plot sink ""Monster-in-Law,"" a comedy that leaves you wondering why Fonda chose to return after fifteen years to.... this.",1207526400,,2912,4.806

I am a fan of Jennifer, but for me she has become so famous that you just see her as herself, the brand, and not an actress and not the character. I think she should stop acting because she also just ""acts."" That means she's not acting from the heart, like Nicole Kidman. When I watch Ms. Kidman I feel her character. Jennifer is just saying the words, and screams when the script says scream, and tries to act cute (which is her usual persona in all her movies). That is not acting.

They praised ""Something's Gotta Give"" to the high heavens but I wanted to kill somebody while suffering through so called ""one of the best comedies of the year"". They universally agree that latest Woody Allen's comedies suck - and I believe that they (Woody's comedies not the critics) are funny and enjoyable. Plus, Jane Fonda came out of retirement to make ""Monster-In-Law"", her first movie in 15 years. I saw a few weeks ago Fonda's ""Barbarella"", one of the silliest and campiest movies ever made and I liked it a lot, mostly due to Fonda's charm.

I watched ""Monster-in-Law"" last night and I found it uninteresting, boring, and irritating. The worst quality - it is not funny. Forget about laughs, I hardly smiled at all. I almost fell asleep - its 101 minutes seemed like eternity. Every twist in so- called plot was predictable, every joke -stupid, the ending - sappy and mediocre. In one word, the movie was a mess with only one redeeming value - Wanda Sykes (Ruby) as Fonda's personal assistant. Both, J.Lo and JF tried hard to do something with the material but it just did not work. In the perfect world, if Woody Allen had written the script and made the movie with three of them, Fonda, Lopes, and Sykes - we could've had if not a masterpiece but a wonderful and funny comedy.

It would be hard to imagine an all-around less funny and less pleasant comedy than ""Monster-in-Law"" - or a bigger waste of Jane Fonda's talents as an actress.  At the very least, Fonda should sue writer Anya Kochoff and director Robert Luketic for career and name defamation, and then fire her agent for signing her onto this monumental turkey.

Fonda is robbed of all her dignity playing Viola Fields, a neurotic harridan who brings new meaning to the term ""over possessive mother,"" and who does everything she can to sabotage the impending marriage of her son to the utterly unobjectionable Charlie played by Jennifer Lopez.  Viola schemes and plans against her until Charlie eventually gets wise to what's going on and turns the tables on her.  And that is literally all there is to the movie.  For a grueling hour and a half, we watch as the same note is struck over and over again to decidedly diminishing results.  Even obnoxious characters need to have some redeeming traits if they are to be funny, but Viola has none.  She is a sadistic shrew with the emotional development of a spoiled three-year-old who lacks even a glimmer of basic human decency - until the end of course when she literally turns on a dime and becomes all sweetness and light, in what is clearly one of the least convincing character conversions in movie history.  All of this might have been tolerable if the writing had been any good.  But the comic setups and routines are so devoid of cleverness and bite that we sit in jaw-dropping, stone-faced silence as the movie plays itself out.

Fonda is not the only performer who embarrasses herself in this film.  Lopez throws her heart and soul into the pathetic character she's been called on to play here, but she lacks an actor's ability to read lines and register emotions with true conviction.  Michael Vartan is utterly bland in the admittedly hopeless role of the man over whom the two women are waging their titanic struggle (when the bone-of-contention is this unworthy, how are we supposed to believe in any of it?).  The one bright spot in the film is the performance of Wanda Sykes as Viola's personal assistant and stereotypical comic sidekick.  Her sardonic comments and generally flip attitude go a long way towards redeeming the scenes she's in.  Hers is the only character whose zingers, though standard and predictable, are actually somewhat funny.

I'm sure that when Fonda first signed on to this fiasco she saw it as an opportunity to cut loose and have a little fun lampooning her strong feminist image (either that or it`s a total sellout.  I`ll let you decide).  But didn't she even bother to read the script?  My suspicion is that she didn't and that the title alone is what caught her attention.  It's a pity the moviemakers used up all their creativity and wit on the moniker and left none for the movie itself.",1156636800,,2872,4.7269076305220885

He was right on one point, well two points...Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes, both a lot of fun here in Monster-in-Law. It's just what you'd expect...a mother-in-law-to-be (Fonda) has a hard time accepting that her only son is getting married and decides to make the bride-to-be's life (played by Lopez) a living hell, with the help of her sarcastic assistant (Sykes). I really cannot stand Jennifer Lopez at all, but my friend insisted I give the movie a chance and at least watch it. So watch I did, and I really tried to be objective about it, but Lopez was just trying to hard to fit into this role, much like she tries to hard to fit into a dress during the movie, which in fact was quite amusing. What saved this movie for me were the performances of Fonda and Sykes in this. Both were wonderfully funny and helped me to be a little less annoyed by Lopez.

It is an instant classic about a Jennifer Lopez-y type woman who falls in love with Michael Vaughan from ""Alias"" and (uh-oh!) then she has to deal with the mother-in-law from heck (and I don't mean heck!).

Ms. Jane Fonda is as great as she was when she was teaching Robert DeNiro to read in that reading movie, and even better than she was in Electric Horseman, which I never saw because I didn't like Urban Cowboy. In The China Syndrome she was great too, although not as terrific as Michael Douglas' facial hair, which was essentially the third main character (and the fourth wall).

This movie is about something we can all relate to: falling in love with J.Lo is great, unless your mother hates J.Lo, in which case, you better start having lots of comic premises and Wanda Sykes nearby.

When you're not laughing you'll be crying while watching this movie, and both may be inappropriate, but that's what America is all about. This movie is better than Patton and Sound of Music combined!",1153785600,,1094,4.5948717948717945

Jay-Lo plays the un-lucky bride-to-be-flattened, a beautiful yet self-supporting character who doesn't fall for Fonda's tricks easily yet can't keep from going to war with her.  The script posits the two as opposite forces of nature doomed to battle til death do they part.  Along the way, the story throws a few curves their way - an ugky dress for Fonda, an allergy for Jay-Lo, an actor who claims to be a psychiatrist and a not-so-surprising visit from Fonda's mother in law.

""Monster"" is a montser of a movie, and not in the good way.  The story forces every joke - rams it down your throat.  For a big flcik, the movie is conspicuously unamusing and unentertaining - there isn't a single decent joke in the movie, nor a plot turn that you won't spot a mile away.  Worst of all i sthe part of Fonda's personal...assistant, Ruby.  Played ernestly by Wanda Sykes, the character is meant top embody the disbelief that rational people would have on witnessing the acts of the protagonists.  It's like the writers knew that nobody would buy their uninspired mess of a story, so they hedged their bet and crafted a character that would mirror their disbeleief first - as if that woukd distract people from registering their skpeticism by having somebody do it for them.  ""Monster"" is like the unentertaining sequel to a more sincere hit - the kind of movie that studios feel they have to make as a follow-up to a more decent movie.  (But even botched sequels offer the memory to their better predecessors - the best we can say for ""Monster"" is that there won't be a sequel.)  I tried to sit through this flick with an open mind, but every frame vindicated my initial assessment of the flick as a mindless star-vehicle, the kind that Hollywood seems to have no problem soending money on.",1152576000,5,1932,4.666666666666667

If you youngums haven't seen her before, check out Coming Home, Fun w/ Dick & Jane, Julia, They Shoot Horses Don't They, or just about anything else she has done to see her real talent.  She is trying to have fun here, but except for Wanda Sykes, she overwhelms everyone else in the scene.

Lopez has always had limited range and is better at low key films.  I haven't seen here show any good comic timing nor the ability to rise above the words.  She's okay but she could have done more with say, the scene where she's trying to fit into a tight dress.  Michael Varghton is not one of my favorites as I think he always has the same expression on the show Alias.  He is okay here but doesn't add anything except being the object of the 2 women's affections.

This was a good movie. Thank goodness I waitd for it on cable. I didn't think it would be a good movie but it turned out to not be so bad after all. Jane Fonda does a great job at playing a dark character who has been replaced by a younger woman and whose erratic behavior is intolerable to her assistant.

I'd heard different things about it from all kinds of different people, and besides, I'm not much of a ""But the critics loved it"" type of person anyway - my tastes vary too widely for me to settle down on anything. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found a romantic comedy that was genuinely well-done.

Lopez's character, a stunningly pretty thirtysomething named Charlie who works temp jobs and walks dogs, absolutely glowed in this movie (sometimes literally - thank you makeup department?), in what I suspect may be the only role I've ever liked her in. The story abides loyally by the standard romcom formula: girl meets boy, girl and boy fall in love, girl meets the parents. Well, one of them, anyway. Jane Fonda is hilarious as Viola Fields, a fired TV show host whose mental breakdowns are not uncommon, and she works well with assistant Ruby (played by Wanda Sykes, the only token black chick role I've had any respect for in years). Viola's son Kevin (ALIAS's Michael Vartan, who unfortunately has to fill the traditional romcom shoes of two-dimensional eye-candy) introduces Charlie and Viola, thus beginning a war of matricidal proportions - it's not exactly the most original concept, but it's truly fun to watch unfold, as all of the characters have such real chemistry between them. Even supporting characters like Charlie's best friends Morgan and Remy (a gay character without a stereotype - gasp! well, mostly) are fun to watch.

The ending is stuffed full of sap and predictability, leaving an almost bitter taste in your mouth when the credits roll, but it barely put a dent in the overall satisfaction I had with the movie - whatever The Critics say, those shadowy demigods of cultural Hollywood, is to be taken with a grain of salt.

1Young, Beautiful Woman played by Jennifer Lopez

1 Young Sexy Man played by Michael Vartan

1 Gay Friend played by Adam Scott

1 Scary Mother-in-Law played by Jane Fonda

1 Smart Mouthed Assistant played by Wanda Sykes

Directions:

Mix together thoroughly. Watch movie carefully for:  screaming, terrible cooking, revenge, temper tantrums, witty lines and TONS of laughs.

Jennifer Lopez plays Charlie, a young artist. She despairs of ever finding true love after a series of unfortunate bad dates until she meets Kevin. Kevin is the perfect man: nice, wonderful, kind. The only problem is his mother, Viola.

Viola, fresh out of the loony bin after a nervous breakdown, is shocked to learn that her only son is dating a woman. Much less marrying her. Instead of opening her arms to her son's new fianc?e, she chooses to have Charlie investigated and begins her plan to drive her soon to be daughter-in-law crazy.

Ruby, Viola's wise cracking assistant warns her: ""This will end badly."" Things begin to go badly when Charlie's friend Remy finds a file Viola has compiled on Charlie. Realizing that Viola has been having her investigated and is trying to drive her crazy on purpose; Charlie begins to wage her own war.

And so begins the battle of the Mother-in-Law and the Fianc?e! Who will win? Who will triumph? Will the wedding still be on? And, most importantly, should the mother of the bride wear white to the wedding?

I have wanted to see ""Monster In Law"" ever since it came out, mainly for Jane Fonda's return to film. I love Jane Fonda (""Nine to Five"" is one of my all time favorite films) and was happy to see that she was returning to the silver screen. At first, I was disappointed to learn that Fonda's co-star would be Jennifer Lopez.

Normally I can't stand Jennifer Lopez. I don't like her singing and I find her acting unconvincing, benign and trite. Oddly enough, I really loved her in this movie. She's believable, funny and wonderfully entertaining. Truth be told, her performance surprised the hell out of me.

Two great performances that need mention here are by Wanda Sykes and Adam Scott.  She plays Ruby who is Viola's assistant. She has the best lines in the entire movie and, mark my words: You'll laugh your butt off at almost every line. Wanda Sykes takes what could have been a boring, useless role and transforms it in to something of comic legend. She adds spark to the film and tons of flair.

Speaking of flair, Adam Scott's portrayal of gay friend next door Remy is a treat. He's funny and doesn't play the role up as the typical homosexual. There are no limp wrists and sequins here. Instead we are treated to a remarkably funny performance in such a small part.

""Monster In Law"" is a win on all counts. It's funny, delightful, has heart and is a hell of a good time. If you want to fill an hour or so with tons of laughs, pick up this movie and prepare yourself for an excellent time. You won't be sorry!

The first problem is the unconvincing and too fast relationship between Lopez and her boyfriend.  There is nothing special enough between them to believe that they could get together that fast and move in together.

The second big problem is the embarrassing overacting from Jane Fonda. Frankly, Jane should have known better, and avoided this film at all costs.  No mother in law would carry on the way she has.  I realise this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts, but her weird performance was uncalled for.

The third big problem is that the viewer does not care for any of the characters.

I mean, how many times have we seen the ultra femanine [...] roomate? The wise cracking assistant? I would have to grant this movie two stars instead of one because there were two parts were I did laugh out loud, but the rest of the time I was just rolling my eyes. In my eyes, Jane Fonda looked fab on screen in all of her great outfits, but her character was so over the top and zany, she was past the point of being funny. Michael Vartan was only lukewarm as the main character's fiancee, even Jennifer Lopez's character kind of annoyed me. Another thing that annoyed me in this movie was that Jane Fonda's character kept refering to JLo as fat, which she most certainly is not.

2355875,3,B000A343RI,"I watched two flicks this weekend. One where Jane Fonda fights J Lo (Monster-in-Law) for trying to steal her son and another where Godzilla vents his anger on the world for developing nuclear devices (Final Wars).

Similar: Both were entertaining. Both had laughable acting. Both were funny at times even while attempting to be serious. And both included stars (Jane and Godzilla) whose shared claim to fame is sending the world political messages from Asia.

Similar: Both had fighting. The battle scenes between Jane and J Lo were almost as action packed as the battle scenes between Godzilla and his foes, and the battle scenes were also deliberately comical.

Similar: Jane and J Lo acted together as well together as Godzilla and Mothra; the supporting cast in Monster-in-Law was on par with the acting of the supporting cast of Final Wars.

Opposite ends of the spectrum: In Monster-in-Law the predictable ""you-go-girl"" style of comic relief provided by Wanda Sykes' character Ruby was as good as any of the Jane/J Lo battle dialogue. But in Final Wars the, drawn out, predictable campyness and unintentional comedy of the dubbed dialogue took away from the cool monster battles.

Opposite ends of the spectrum: In Final Wars there were political overtones over The World's use of nuclear devices, but in Monster-in-Law Jane checked her political views at the door.

If I had to do it all over again with the choice of watching only one of the two films I guess it would be Monster-in-Law. After all, while the politics of Jane and Godzilla are equally silly, at least Jane doesn't use Monster-in-Law to express any of her views.

While political films clearly aren't my thing, I must say that I am relatively excited about a new blockbuster in the works....It's a joint sequel to two recent films (Fahrenheit 9/11 & King Kong) with the preproduction operating title of Moore Kong.

This is mostly due to the comic routine of Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes who was just hilarious!  The film is pretty standard and has most likely been done over and over again.  Charlie (Lopez) after bad relationship, one after another, meets and falls in love with Kevin (Vartan).  The only catch is she's never met his mother, and when she does meet Viola (Fonda) the sparks fly, but not in a good way.  Viola will stop at nothing to end the relationship between her son and this 'TEMP' and she enlists the help of her personal assistant Ruby (Wanda).  The film really starts off strong, the scene where Viola loses her job is histarical, and just keeps chugging along.  Wanda really keeps the laughter in check with her one liners as she puts in her two cents every once in a while, while Fonda proves she can carry the comic portion of a film.  She is wonderful.  Lopez is decent, not her best performance but thats mostly because she's overshadowed by Fonda and Vartan is practically non-existant in this film, only around to lay down a foundation fro plot and then he dissapears in the background as his female costars take over.

(Wanda Sykes) I won't delve too much into the movie, so as not to spoil it for anyone.

The DVD is given a nice two-disc treatment, although New Line also could have gotten away with two separate 1-disc editions. However, they chose to go for a 2-disc, putting both fullscreen and anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen versions on disc 1 and all bonus features on disc 2. The transfer is excellent, with wonderful colors, not overly soft or sharp, and very clean. The audio is also excellent.

Disc 2 contains five behind-the-scenes featurettes, including one on Jane Fonda's return to the big screen. Also included are deleted scenes that I thought probably should have stayed in, a blooper reel, trailers, and something called Ruby's Makeup Bag. (To get what that means, you'll need to watch the movie, then watch that little bonus right there.)

Yes, it's cliched and it's fluffy. But I found it to be funny and enjoyable, and it's nice to see Jane Fonda giving her all to make the character of Viola truly look psychotic. And, well, it's just nice to see Wanda Sykes doing her thing.",1138579200,,1401,4.686991869918699
2355882,2,B000A343RI,I was very disappointed by this movie. It is boring. The person who wrote the script didn't really bother too much to think to make it interesting. Only cheap humor is used here and that's it.,1138406400,2,192,4.361111111111111
2355883,1,B000A343RI,"...then we'd be rid of Jennifer Lopez as both a movie star and a ""singer"" (if that's what you'd call her?) -in other words; Monster In Law is one bad movie! It's of the Sandra Bullock-kind of comedy, only that she has charm enough to carry her movies -and make them at least cute and entertaining. The problem with Lopez is that she lacks both charm and talent. She can dance, that's it! She has only two expressions on her face (and that should be a problem when you're acting); Either surprised or innocent. Lopez is in 2006 a settled actress -she is ironically far more famous for her music and movies than for her real talent; Dancing. I have (as you might have figured out by now) never been a big fan of her, but because she lately has become so huge as an artist it is almost impossible not to become critical. Her singing is far more based on her body than her voice, and the same goes for her acting. Sandra Bullock or Jennifer Anniston could have made ""Monster In Law"" far more watchable, no matter how stupid and predictable script. And why? Because they are both able to make fun of themselves, and look pretty at the same time, they don't seem to take themselves so seriously -Lopez seem to have to look ""adorable"" in every scene she's in. And with her two expressions that is. She is boring. But I actually had my hopes for this one because of Jane Fonda, a far better actress and a living legend in the same business. A shame not even she could save this all-done-and-seen-before-comedy, because she has a bit of a clown in her. Good luck next time!

My last Lopez-movie!",1138060800,3,1586,4.394557823129252
2355884,3,B000A343RI,"There's something to be said about a movie that makes you cringe, laugh, or groan at the appropriate times.  Monster-in-Law is one such film and that characteristic makes it stand out from many humdrum romantic comedies.

The movie starts off by introducing the impeccably nice Charlie (Jennifer Lopez).  I've always been fond of Jennifer Lopez' movies (with the possible exception of Gigli) and this role is one her less adventurous ones, nevertheless played just right.  Charlie lives somewhere along the shores of what looks like Venice Beach (I'm not sure if this was specified but I just recognized the place).  She's got the required gay best friend.  She's a receptionist for a doctor, a dog-walker, aspiring artist, and all around good girl.  And she's available.  Come on.  She sounds like she's having the toughest time getting a guy interested and while walking dogs along the beach she's being ignored by pretty much every guy that jogs by.  Really, any guy who sees her doing what she does would gather the guts to at least smile or say hi.  Anyway, one guy does (Michael Vartan) and in a series of coincidences would keep running into each other.  Finally, they go out, fall in love, and the rest should be history.

However, Viola (Jane Fonda, in a stunning return to the big screen after 15 years), Charlie's future mother-in-law, a proverbial Barbara Walters in the film's world who had just learned six months earlier that she would be replaced at the end of the season, and got sent to a wellness center when she flipped from the news, enters the fray.  Viola, fresh from mental rehabilitation, clearly disagrees with Charlie and her son's wedding.  ""My son, the brilliant surgeon, is marrying a temp!""  Or something like that.

Viola's voice of reason yet slave to her insanity is her assistant (Wanda Sykes).  She tries her best to curb Viola's plans to ruin the future nuptial only to be misinterpreted most of the time.  What happens is a virtual war of the most estrogen levels that occurs completely unbeknownst to the groom.  Really, the cruelty is outstanding!  But all in all an entertaining experience.

The expected happy ending happens way too easily for my taste.  It's a point that would have been driven into any mother-in-law far earlier in the real world, in my opinion.

The secondary characters are, while minor, not forgettable.  That's one of this movie's best strengths.  Every minor character has a face, a persona, and an importance, down to the waiter of a restaurant.

Many critics disagree with the manner of Jane Fonda's return to the silver screen, but I for one feel she fits the role well and makes it work.  A lesser actor would have been unintentionally laughable.

It was pointed out to me during the movie that Jennifer Lopez and Micheal Vartan's ex-significant others were currently dating.  Just an interesting food for thought.

Overall, an entertaining flick for fun and laughs.",1137801600,,2936,4.882591093117409

2355887,3,B000A343RI,"I thought that the movie Monster-In-Law was funny.  I especially liked Jane Fonda's bad-woman turn after years of seeing her in some good woman roles.  Viola does everything to stop Charlie, Jennifer Lopez' character from marrying her son Kevin. Even getting in a catfight with Charlie! And wrecking a party gathering too. Viola is very defensive and protective of her son in most cases. Wanda Sykes is funny in most scenes. After so much back and forth, Charlie confronts Viola the day of the wedding and defends her and Kevin getting married. Viola is silent for the first time. I liked how the producers smartly paired two generations of Hollywood movie stars in one film with Fonda and Lopez. They start kind of sticky the first 20 minutes, but they blend well as the movie rolls on. It ends this generation gap of current and established actors not liking each other's period of films.  This movie did well on all fronts. When people see the last name Fonda on the marquee, they'll go to it--she's her own brand name!  The plot can be a struggle to get through as we don't know some of the other characters in the film. They keep much of the focus on Fonda and Lopez since they're A-list talent. And not very much on Michael Vartan's character Kevin. I thought that this movie came at a good time in May when a lot of couples, young and older, marry at around Memorial Day and the summer months. It might have prevented the nerves and tensions of their upcoming wedding days. One of the most cleverly made movies pairing an already successful actress (Lopez) with one of the most legendary and classy actresses ever (Fonda)!",1135555200,2,1629,4.626297577854671

Along with Wanda Sykes (one of the funniest comediennes) and Jane Fonda, I was ready for a delightfully sunny tale of a mother and a wife battling it out. This movie is funny, light, romantic, and it never gets too sexual, too profane, or even too dangerous. Wanda's one-liners are really funny. Though he isn't around a lot, Vartan makes a welcome change to funnyman. Jane Fonda is great at physical comedy even though she does look kind of old. However, the real star is J.Lo.

2355899,3,B000A343RI,"I watched this last night, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I can't recall ever seeing Jane Fonda in a comic role before, especially not one so physical.  While Jennifer Lopez is a lukewarm talent (in all her chosen fields), she wasn't too bad as the foil to Jane's antics.

Jennifer Lopez plays Charlie, a hap hazzard jack of all trades floundering through life when she suddenly meets Mr. Perfect, a handsome doctor no less named Michael.  In a sudden rush, he asks her to marry him after they've known each other for a few weeks / months and he brings her home to meet his mother.  Jane has just been let go from her glamorous job as a journalist and is feeling her age at long last.  When she meets Charlie she becomes instantly jealous and posessive, and when Hanoi Jane gets mad, she has a meltdown.

It was amusing, but the real star of this show was Wanda Sykes, Jane's fearless assistant who keeps putting her in her place and somewhat keeps the peace.  What kept me from giving it more than 3 stars was that this was, after all, a chick flick.  The humor was a little slapstick and it was pretty funny when we got to see that first scene where Jane bashes JLo's face into the coffee table over and over, but after a while the antics just got tired.  It had a happy ending where they realized (thanks to Shelly Winters as grandma) that they didn't want to be at each others' throats still in another 30 years, so they put their diffences aside.  And they had too many stereotypes to fall back on: sassy sister for comic relief, the gay man companion who's got the back of his beloved woman friend, the screaming antics of the jealous woman, JLo's face blowing up after she eats the nuts, and the backstabbing foiled plots.  It was lite entertainment.

And if Jane Fonda is supposed to be in her 60s now, not all of her is!  She's been plucked and pulled and stitched and stretched more than a Thanksgiving turkey.  If it's not enough that Hanoi Jane angered a whole generation or two with her Vietnam antics, she built her own empire on her fitness and workout videos and didn't follow her own advice.  She kept telling us that if we kept doing those donkey kicks we too would look as buff and beautiful as her, and then she goes out and gets her boobs done.  *Sigh*  I'll just have to accept my cellulite, the wrinkles and weight fluxes then.",1130371200,3,2374,4.344671201814059
2355900,2,B000A343RI,"After a fifteen-year absence from the screen, Jane Fonda at 67 looks pretty terrific and acts with ferocity, but it's a shame she is co-starring in a complete vacuum of a movie. Director Robert Luketic is not a filmmaker who has displayed much subtlety in the past (""Legally Blonde"", ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!""), and unfortunately he stoops to even lower levels of juvenile-level hijinks and carries forth an outlandishly cartoonish tone to this decidedly lowbrow comedy. The result is a 2005 studio-system misfire that proves ultimately condescending to anyone who would rightfully expect more from Fonda's acting return.

Similar to the character she played in ""The Electric Horseman"" twenty-six years earlier, Fonda plays a rich and powerful Barbara Walters-like television news personality named Viola Fields, who has reached that certain age where her demographics-conscious bosses have suddenly replaced her with a twenty-something blonde. Her slapstick reaction is to physically attack an air-headed Britney Spears look-alike on her talk show. This scene is played out so methodically that the laughs have evaporated by the time the pay-off comes.

Adding insult to injury, her coddled son Kevin, a doctor of course, proposes to a modest, working-class girl named Charlie right in front of her. This thoroughly predictable set-up could have been more interesting had first-time screenwriter Anya Kochoff's script bothered to address any of the potential conflicts - racial, socioeconomic, and even physical - with emotional intelligence, psychological insight or even a sense of irony. For the most part, she goes for the cheapest laughs available in a bid to attract the lowest common denominator among the audience.

That's a shame since Fonda has proven her comedy mettle in vehicles as diverse as ""Barefoot in the Park"", ""Nine to Five"" and ""The Morning After"". The twice-Oscared actress has been reduced to playing a career-obsessed, martini-swilling harridan in a series of hit-or-miss sight gags that hang precariously on the actress' goodwill. That's better than the fate of Jennifer Lopez, as she portrays an inconsistent character in an understandably confused manner. At first, her Charlie is a sweet and eccentric innocent, then a vengeful harpy and finally a forgiving sage - all for the sake of the contrived plot turns. It is assumed we are meant to root for her, but the character is such a moving target of contradictions that it becomes too trying to sympathize with her plight. It also doesn't help that Fonda, with her crisp diction, unyielding posture and crack comedy sense, is simply more interesting to watch.

The inevitable showdown between Fonda and Lopez is a disappointing cop-out with a sudden epiphany catalyzed by an ill-used Elaine Stritch as Viola's acidic mother-in-law. In the no-win role of the clueless man in-between, Michael Vartan is nearly transparent as Kevin, though it's understandable that he stands back once the love story has been established in the first fifteen minutes and his character deprioritized in favor of the two conflicting women. Despite a few good lines, stand-up comic Wanda Sykes portrays Viola's wiseass assistant Ruby as if she walked off the set of ""The Jeffersons"" - all sassy asides and observations too honest for her boss to handle.

In order to accommodate widescreen and full-screen versions on one disc, a lot of the extras have been relegated to a second disc. The participant-heavy audio commentary on the first disc, which includes Sykes and Luketic but excludes Fonda and Lopez, is not as insightful as one would hope. The second disc contains several disposable featurettes that focus on Lopez, Fonda, Vartan and Luketic individually, as well as some deleted scenes and a pretty decent gag reel.  The print quality of the film is fine, which is more than what I can say about the production itself.",1129766400,2,3889,5.2144
2355901,3,B000A343RI,"I have to admit that the ONLY reason I watched this flick is because I always try to sit through any film my wife wants to watch, regardless if it really interests me or not.  This film in particular was not on my list of ""Things I Must Do Before I Have A Heart Attack.""  The primary reason:  Jane Fonda.  I've never liked the woman.  Ever since I found out the ugly truth about ""Hanoi"" Jane I've had a sour taste in my mouth for her.

Well, my wife really wanted to see this flick and I decided to give in.  We watched it together and I honestly have to say that it was very funny.  Jennifer Lopez and Michael Vartan turn in solid and funny performances.  Though Lopez draws the attention of many a fellow, she isn't in my Top Ten.  In this film, however, Lopez is gorgeous from the word go.  Perhaps it's the ""regular gal"" air about her character or the vengeful side she later shows, but she really won me over in this one.  Vartan plays her soon to be beau, and it's all done with tongue firmly in cheek.  Jane Fonda's overboard performance as Vartan's mother is executed with a lethal dose of wit and evil.  I actually forgot about her shortcomings while watching this flick.

The true winner in this film is Wanda Sykes.  She has a limited role with limited lines, but she makes the best of every one of her little moments on the screen.  She really steals the show.

The story is pretty formulaic.  Fonda doesn't want her son to marry Lopez and will stop at nothing to put an end to their love.  Along the way, hilarity comes in the form of tricks, deceit, and out-and-out evil.  It's pretty funny, but there's nothing new under the Hanoi sun on this film.

Overall, this is a nice little romantic comedy that is worthy of a few viewings.  Though I'll never buy it, I might rent it again sometime down the road.",1129593600,10,1818,4.2823529411764705

And the lines delivered at the end where the grandmother tells Lopez, 'You are a beautiful, exotic, latina bride and my grandson is lucky to have you'!!  Come on folks.  One can't help but wonder if Affleck's friends and family never thought  hispanic Lopez was good enough for their Boston whitebread son.

Everyone did a good job with the material.  But basically the actors had no chemistry with one another.  Michael Vartan was perfectly cast as the doctor love interest, Jane Fonda is the perfect vixen mother-in-law, and Jennifer Lopez was believable as the girlfriend.

But somehow the whole setup wasn't believable.  Maybe Lopez seemed ""tired"" in the filming.  She didn't have her usual intensity in her acting.

Lopez is radiantly beautiful and Vartan is adorable and Fonda is very interesting.  So see the movie and enjoy Wanda Sykes' funny lines too.",1129420800,3,1069,5.034285714285715

2355910,2,B000A343RI,"After 15 years of leaving the movies, Jane Fonda returns in a movie that was not worth the wait, but the character and performance was. This is Jane's movie. This is her return, and she is wonderful in it. Everything else, including the movie, doesn't seem to matter as much. If you've seen the trailers and clips and all that, then the movie will probably turn out to be exactly what you expected it to be. Light, colorful, silly, and not very good. The most disappointing thing about the movie was that there was a lot of potential here. It may not of been that good, but it sure definitley could of been. The most surprising there here is how I actually liked Jennifer Lopez. I've never really seen any of her movies, so I guess I had nothing to compare it too. But she was charming and cute. More on that later. Lopez plays Charlie, a temp who has a number of jobs on her plate. During some of her jobs, she meets a man(Michael Vartan), and the two fall in love. Then there is his mother. His mom is TV personality Viola Fields(Fonda), who just lost her job to a young thing and snapped. When released from the funny farm, she learns that her son has this new girlfriend. Not fond of Charlie right off the bat, Viola becomes even more horrified when he proposes and Charlie says yes. This sets off a wave of tricks that Viola concocts to drive her future daughter in law away before she destroys(or so she thinks)her son's life. There is a lot of potential here, and the film does pull off some fun humor and slapstick comedy, but those are few and far between. A lot of the action and goofball humor could of been pushed further, but the film plays it relatively safe. I don't know why since the movie audiences of today have been witness to many a gross out gag on the silver screen. Our two leads are game, though. Fonda looks great, and it seems as though she hasn't missed a beat. She is obviously having a ball in the role, and you will too watching her. This is the type of role she really sinks her teeth into and pulls it off. In the docus, she says she has never played such a character or has been over the top. Well, she does a great job with it. More comedy and characters like Viola in the future wouldn't be a bad thing for her. Lopez is not an Oscar worthy actress, but she is very appealing in the role. She has an easy presence and works well alongside her legendary co-star. Lopez never goes over the top like Fonda. She gets her buttons pushed, but she never exhibits the wicked, over the top fun that Fonda does. Maybe she should have. Alias' Vartan is the unfortunate one here. He is basically stuck with the thankless role of son/fiancee, and is only there to set the two up together and then takes off out of town so the two women in his life can have the spotlight. He looks bored. Then there is Wanda Sykes. Great casting. A lot of the laughs in the movie come from her. She has a mouth on her, and isn't afraid to let it fly at Viola. She also has some of the best lines in the entire movie. And would somebody tell me why they had to waste the brilliance of Elaine Stritch in such a small role?!. Director Robert Luketic has a nice eye for detail, and he knows how to film the scenery and catch all the colors(mostly Fonda's wardrobe and huge house)very well. He gets a fun, comedic performance out of Jane, and he does a pretty decent job. The script was probably a lot better than what the finished outcome ultimatley became. Viola snaps at the young Britney Spears type and they let her go for someone younger. It was an interesting topic given Fonda's age and she has been gone and there are a crop of hot actresses out there. It would of been interesting if this had been a message throughout the movie. The movie is never as crazy as it wants(and should)be, and there are long periods of time where the humor is stilted and some of the goings on are uncomfortable. There are fun moments here, just not enough. One of the best things about the DVD is in the special features. The short feature about Jane's return to filmmaking after her 15 year abscence was the best one. It was touching and nice to watch. It's saying a lot when a 5 minute feature is better than the movie itself. That being said, it's a great vehicle and character for a big splashy return for Fonda, but that's it. And that's the only reason to see this movie.",1128297600,3,4368,4.282950423216445
2355911,5,B000A343RI,"First off, the movie is hysterical and Jane Fonda does not appear to be trying that hard and her timing is fantastic, while J. Lo's funniest line about ""the pregnant lesbian"" is killer, though her acting really does not appear to be improving.

One thing to keep in the back of one's mind is that even in times of great celebration, there is still pain, and what is outlined next about the genesis of the movie is quite shocking to some.

As many  Diana Ross fans were watching their ""Monster-in-Law"" DVDs, a wave of

sadness took over and from that point never abated. It occured to many

Ross fans that Diana lost out yet again --- this time to emerging diva

Wanda Sykes. Sykes, who plays Jane Fonda's assistant in ""Monster-in-

Law"" was chosen by the Hollywood elite and Ross was cast aside in

favor or Miss Sykes, who,until this point, was seen as a bit of an

unsavory comic a la enemy #1 of Rossnation Paul Mooney. Ross fans

already looked down upon Sykes as a gutter-comic who is not in the

league of their dear Tracee Ellis Ross who they have deemed the best

female comic since Roseanne Barr or Brett Butler.

Ross fans had their hopes pinned on Diana being embraced in a movie a

la Barbra Streisand in ""Meet the Fockers"" in a supporting capacity as

it has been generally stated that Diana's image in the U.S would

improve from such a well-timed appearance. Unfortunately, Diana was

not given the role of Viola's assistant in the movie, and some Ross

fans are on the defensive decreeing,""Oh yeah --- like that would

happen DIANA PLAYING SOMEONE'S ASSISTANT. Of the two women (Fonda and

Ross) who is considered the bigger star worldwide"".

The bonus features of the DVD include the director of the film

extolling the virtues of Sykes and appear to completely ignore the

subject of Diana's potentially having the role -- the omission should

be of some consolation but sadly, it only drives the knife in harder.",1128124800,4,1931,4.595307917888563

This movie is really bad.  In fact during the movie I threw up a little. That was more enjoyable than this movie.  While I don't expect much from Jane ""The Nazi"" Fonda I did expect more from Jennifer Lopez.

2355913,2,B000A343RI,"This movie had promise of a potential comedy and it was funny in some places but JLo did not bring any of those laughs it was Fonda that brought in my chuckles, especially when in the beginning when she attacked the Britney Spears look- alike on her own talk show. Fonda's day certainly wasn't going well by being replaced by a younger woman on her own show and then boom when she needs time to relax she figures out her baby boy is getting married to an all over the place and overall ditzy girl. This doesn't help her stress and she throws a pretty funny tantrum. Her assistant brings humor with Fonda during these times and I found myself liking those parts.

Yet in most parts the show was not too funny, a little bland on the humor at times and Fonda does act a tad too weird at times as if she really wants to be side- splitting, but it didn't work for me. Fonda though was a lot better than JLo though, who I must admit I never have seen as a good actress, and she kills the movie a lot. I don't know JLo is just not that good of an actress. And after knowing JLo music wise I know she is no down to earth, humble little sweet woman. She always tries to act like she's just an ordinary girl- next- door and JLo is far from that image. So her acting that way in this movie I found myself amused at. I don't know, I don't like JLo too much, music or acting wise, and I think she weakened this movie more than anyone else by acting like someone she obviously is not. Some actors could pull that off, a whole new personality, but knowing JLo I just could not see her pulling it off that well. She is not a convincing actress basically for me.

Another reason I found myself not liking this movie is cause this theme is growing too overdone. I only found this out after this movie. The whole meeting the parents and one of them, usually the father, not liking the fiance is getting really old. I don't think I even like the idea of those films anymore cause they are doing way too many of them. Enough with that storyline for awhile, or at least put a new creative spin on it.

So yeah, mostly bland humor, Fonda's son- JLo's fiance being a pretty weak character surprisingly, a few sentimental moments that felt rushed, and a few times some pure humor moments bursting in and an overall nice, cliche kind of ending, gave this movie at least 2- 2.5 stars. Not the best, could have been a lot better.",1127606400,2,2401,4.2039045553145336
2355914,1,B000A343RI,"Well, Madame Em and her husband, Dr. Colonel Mr. Madame Em, actually suffered through what MAY be one of the worst movies ever made (but not ""good"" horrible, like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"")...but HORRIBLE. And I am SURE many queer people who have an idiotic sense of ""humor"" thought it was ""cute.""

It SUCKED so bad, and it SHOULD have been called ""The GHOST GROOM,"" because Michael Vartin, who plays Jennifer Lopez's soon to be groom, might as WELL have been invisible, for all he did, and was given to do, and how much he was in the movie, and how RETARDED his part was. It's like, who even cared he was there?

There was about as much chemistry between Michael Vartin and Jennifer Lopez, as.............let's say, Bea Arthur and Johnny Depp, but wait, maybe even THEY would have had more Chemistry..................sort of like, chemistry between Verne Troyer and Catherine Zeta Jones. Which means, MINUS 0 CHEMISTRY.

Oh, and Jane Fonda, what have you DONE? The ONLY redeeming thing is, she didn't resort to WHITE DIAMONDS lighting, as other aging stars do, she was filmed exactly like everyone else. I mean, Jane has a great body and she IS pushing 70, but she looked AWFUL. Screeching white teeth, old timey hair.....just............ugh.

And her son, Michael Vartin, was a DOCTOR, and I GUESS he had never HAD a girlfriend before Jennifer Lopez, and he was probably 35, which tells us something............

You see, Jennifer Lopez IS THE WORST ACTRESS IN THE WORLD, her head looks like it's been SQUASHED between two GIANT FLAT IRONS, because she has a flat face and a flat back of the head, however, she has a HUGE ASS which she refuses to hide, and HUGE THUNDER THIGHS, and kinda small boobs, which makes her sickening to look at. She's NOT talented, in ANY way, so Madame Em has J. Lo FIRST on the list of Deal Making with Satan. I can only hope the Devil calls in his due REALLY SOON.

Jennifer Lopez's ""style"" of acting is like......oh, say you pinch your nostrils together, and have a whiny, irritating, little girl, bad actress voice, and dialogue like ""Oh, you SHOOT-ENT have!"", or ""Oh, you DIT-INT need to DOO that....oh.........you are TOOO sweet,"" but sound all nasally and completely insincere, and you've got her down.

Then, make her a real ""go-getter"" with three jobs, one of which is a professional Dog Walker, one of which is a Caterer's Assistant, and she secretly designs clothes on the side for nothing. Which is as it should be.

Then she meets that Ghost faced Michael Vartin, and their CHEMISTRY IS SO STRONG (not) and off we go!

Michael Vartin's Mother is Jane Fonda, a high powered Newswoman like Barbara Walters, who is fired for being OLD, and goes nuts and goes to SHADY MEADOWS after her meltdown,gets released because she's ""all better"", and decides to interfere in her only son's life EVEN more than she was before!

I can't IMAGINE that a man that old would not have had girlfriends who met his MOTHER and didn't go RUNNING for the hills, and tell EVERYONE that his Mother was LEGALLY INSANE and a potential murderess. How funny is that? HA HA HA!

So, Jennifer Lopez's character is named CHARLOTTE, but of course, her obligatory gay neighbor, who eyeballs all the cute guys in Lopez's life and makes gay wisecracks, and ANOTHER female fairly cute best friend, call her ""Charlie"" cause it's all cute and free and stupid.

And then, that mindless numbskull, Michael Vartin, dates ""Charlie"" for a few months, and then, takes her to visit his MOM, who is a legend of course, having interviewed Heads of States all over the world, I mean, you name them, she knows them.

And since Jane Fonda PRETENDS to like Jennifer Lopez, Michael Vartin PROPOSES right in front of his Mother, who is seething with killing hatred, and Charlie says ""Yes, yes!

And off we go for one of THE MOST STUPID PLOTS, if you can CALL it that, of the EARTH.

Jane Fonda ""pretends"" to have a heart attack when they are all lunching, and gets to the Hospital, while, handily, she's HIRED AN ACTOR TO PLAY HER PSYCHIATRIST, and he ""recommends"" that Jane Fonda LIVE with Charlie and Michael Vartin until she is more ""stable."" RIIIIIIIIIIIIIGT. And all this time, Michael Vartin has NO FLIPPIN' IDEA HIS MOTHER IS A CONTROLLING EVIL WITCH who will stop at NOTHING to keep her son all to herself.

So, he has a ""Medical Meeting"" someplace REALLY FAR AWAY, and leaves his NEW FIANCEE with Jane Fonda, even though Charlie has been TELLING him that his Mother hates her, and is trying to break them up. He just says ""Oh, Charlie, Mother is just eccentric. I'm sure she loves you! Who couldn't?""

WHAT AN IDIOT.

Of course, Jane Fonda has her black Pearl Baily-like ASSISTANT around for all the usual ""wisecracks"" and ""Asides,"" such as ""Um Um Um...that girl don't know WHAT she gettin' INTO!"" Or, ""You SURE you want to do this to your OWN son? He look HAPPY to me!"" TO which Jane Fonda treats this woman like a SLAVE and basically tells her to shut the Hell up and do as she's told, WHICH SHE DOES.

So, Jane Fonda decides she will drive Jennifer Lopez INSANE. I cannot type all the INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING and idiotic things that transpire, even when Jane Fonda DRESSES UP LIKE GHENGIS KHAN with those pointy metal things on her fingers FOR NO REASON, but it's bad. She runs background checks on Charlie, has DNA testing on Charlie's HAIR. (For what? What is she looking for? We never know).

She cooks her poison food when she realizes that Charlie is allergic to PEANUTS, which of course could KILL her, but Charlie just gets swollen lips and vows to fight Jane Fonda, with pesky little things like replacing Jane Fonda's regular pills with PILLS SO STRONG THEY COULD KILL HER, and letting Jane Fonda pass out FACE DOWN IN SOUP, which in REAL LIFE, WOULD have killed her because she wouldn't have been able to flippin' BREATHE.

Then, the wedding day, and they are slapping each other and Michael Vartin is still OBLIVIOUS, and Charlie tells Jane Fonda to ""Bring it on, Grandma"", which shows SUCH CLASS, and then, Jane Fonda's MOTHER shows up for the wedding, treats JANE FONDA like HUMAN GARBAGE, and ALL OF A SUDDEN CHARLIE SEES why poor Jane Fonda is such a CRAZY BITCH, they forgive each other instantly, Jane Fonda becomes a complete other person, all meek and sorry, and the marriage happens, and the end.

If you want puke or get really pissed off, watch this movie. It's MUCH worse than this review. You just HAVE to see it.",1127520000,9,6439,4.639718804920914
2355915,2,B000A343RI,"Monster In Law is another ""fianc&eacute; meets the parents"" type of movie, this time starring Jane Fonda as the parent, Michael Vartan as her son, and Jennifer Lopez as the future daughter in law. In this version of the classic parental disapproval theme, Fonda's character goes to battle against Lopez's character to see if the marriage can be stopped. Mom's method of madness is to act so nasty toward her son's girlfriend that, hopefully, she will decide it's not worth it anymore and will end the engagement.

This movie has the usual clich&eacute;'s and lacks much originality. There is some humor, but most of it is weak and won't go much further than inducing a modest chuckle or two. The writing of this movie isn't the best and it is mostly predictable. There is only a tiny, tiny amount of suspense, at the very end, when you wait to see if the marriage will actually take place.

Performances are good in this movie, with Jane Fonda as the standout. Fonda shows she still has what it takes to perform, and she looks exceptionally good for a woman her age. Michael Vartan offers a respectable performance, too, and I really liked Wanda Sykes as Fonda's friend and confidant. Jennifer Lopez however, while sincere, seems a little off the mark in this movie.

Monster In Law is a hit and miss type of production- a film that offers a few small laughs and some entertaining moments but little originality and sub par writing. It's worth a watch if there is nothing else available to rent. But if you're like me, you will have transferred the memory of this movie to the rear of your brain where it is unlikely to be thought of or referenced again. It's an average to below average flick, recommended only to those who really enjoy Lopez, Fonda, and the ""meet the parents"" type of movie plot.",1127347200,,1798,4.630094043887147

2355918,2,B000A343RI,"Mothers-in-law. They can be a woman's best friend, or her most lethal enemy.

I always remember the tale of a young man whose mom spent his wedding loudly shouting that they would be divorced in six months, set up a fund for their divorce, and so on. And I imagine that woman was a bit like Jane Fonda's deliciously catty character in the limp ""Monster-in-Law.""

To some degree, ""Monster-in-Law"" isn't a romantic comedy movie. It's an overlong sitcom episode.

Charlie (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog-walker whose dreams are about to come true -- she's engaged to Kevin (Michael Vartan), a sweet and hunky doctor. There's only one small problem: Viola (Jane Fonda), Kevin's strong-willed mumsie, doesn't think that Charlie is right for her perfect son.

So Viola does the only thing she can think of -- she starts pranking Charlie, hoping to drive the unworthy future-in-law away. Poisoned food, ripped dresses, wedding disasters and slap fighting all ensue, but soon Charlie gets sick of it and begins to fight back. Who will win, the desperate fiancee or the force-of-nature mom?

Yeah, it's not much of a plot. I kept waiting for the laugh track to kick in, and a preview for next week's episode.

In fact, the plotlessness is what really hurts ""Monster-in-Law."" Once Charlie and Viola are introduced, the entire film descends into a series of pranks that are dropped in favor of warm'n'fuzzy. Slapstick ones too -- if Robert Luketic had taken the P.G. Wodehouse route of elaborate pranking, it might have worked. But watching Fonda and Lopez going bonkers at each other isn't very funny.

It doesn't help that the screenplay is as limp as the plotting. Poor Vartan is forced to spout endless romance-novel cheez; ""What are you doing the rest of your life?"", gag me. And alas, innocent moviegoers are forced to endure yet more tributes to Lopez's much-hyped posterior, which probably has a stylist and trailer all its own.

Jennifer Lopez is the kiss of death to romantic comedies -- there's nothing very funny about her face, her body, or her way of delivering lines. And to be honest, Vartan doesn't fit in this movie any better. The ""Alias"" star looks rather confused, as if he isn't sure how he ended up in this particular film. Not to mention a bit overwhelmed by the catfighting.

The saving graces? Fonda has wild, hilarious manic energy that overcomes the thinness of her role, and makes her quite fun to watch. And Wanda Sykes, as her P.A., gets the best lines of the whole movie. When the two of them are on the screen together, they're pure hilarity. In fact, forget Lopez -- make the movie about Wanda and Jane, and you've got a hit.

Cheesy dialogue and no plot sink ""Monster-in-Law,"" a comedy that leaves you wondering why Fonda chose to return after fifteen years to.... this.",1127174400,5,2793,4.787941787941788

A really bad use of Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez. Both of these women have talent sadly missing from this movie.

I didn't care about any of these people, the plot is terrible, and there is no steam between Lopez and the man she's supposed to be in love with. He's boring and a wimp.

Putting down someone who is working any job she can get to keep things together is slimy. Jane's attitude toward Jennifer does nothing to make the audience care for her or her problems. A manipulative mother is sad. There is nothing in the story to make it funny.

Mom's psychiatrist is a waiter posing as a Dr. Why doesn't her son, a physician himself, catch this? How can this man write a prescription for medication for the Mom? Why is over use of anti-anxiety drugs suppose to be funny?

Jennifer's character reveals her allergies to certain foods. It is NOT funny (and quite dangerous) when Jane's character puts peanuts into gravy Jennifer will eat. The movie shows her face and lips swollen, but, in reality, a person can die from this kind of allergy when airways swell and close.

I kept waiting for the whole things to get better, but it never did. The son is completely oblivious to all his mother's manipulations and we just know Jane & Jennifer will become pals in the end. Why? Nothing in the story line leads the viewer to belive that will happen except this is a Hollywood movie, so it does.

I even liked Enough-- she made a stale movie that much fresher. It's not different for Monster-In-Law. Half the time, you'll be wondering why they're fighting, but suspend your disbelief and just watch these two crazy women practically kill one another.

J. Lo plays the free-spirited Charlie. She walks dogs, paints, designs clothes, whatever she feels like. One day, she bumps into a guy, Kevin the doctor, (Michael Vartan) at a coffee shop. Sparks fly (or at least they're supposed to... Vartan and Lopez have zero chemistry). They fall madly in love within a matter of a few months, but there's just one problem. You guessed it, his mother (Jane Fonda). She's an ex-TV show talk host, who was ousted for a leggier, younger woman. Needless to say, she goes off the deep end and winds up in a mental hospital. She's released at the same time her son decides to tell her that he's getting married, which she can't believe because he is HER baby and no one elses. How could anyone replace a crazy, clingy mom? So she uses her ""illness"" to make Charlie completely miserable, with the hope of driving her away so she doesn't have to share her only son.

You might feel miserable about half way through. You'll wonder if Charlie and mommy dearest will ever stop thinking of themselves and start thinking about poor Kevin, who is oblivious to their terrible fighting. It felt like a long time coming by the end of the movie. This movie IS slow, but at least it gives you something to laugh at. RECOMMENDED.",1126828800,3,1680,4.634228187919463

You could tell that Fonda really enjoyed playing the part of the crazy mother-in-law to be.

I made a mistake in assuming that anything associated with J-Lo would automatically be craptastic, but this movie is actually pretty entertaining. The formula is pretty simple: Kevin, a doctor (Michael Vartan), falls in love with Charlie, a receptionist/dog walker/yoga instructor (Lopez), and brings her home to meet his mother. Unfortunately, his mother happens to be the infamous Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), a former talk show host who has just returned from a trip to the loony bin after being dropped by her network. Viola doesn't think her son could possibly be serious about a woman like Charlie, but when the couple becomes engaged, the irate mother-in-law-to-be pulls every dirty trick in the book to split the two of them up.

A lot of things about this movie are pretty predictable, but it's worth watching mainly because of Fonda. She pulls out all the stops in her crazy and comical role, resulting in a lot of laughs. (My favorite scene was when Viola imagined smashing Charlie's face into a cake over and over again...I'm sure a lot of people would kill for the chance to do that to J-Lo!) Wanda Sykes has a great supporting role as Viola's wisecracking assistant, and Elaine Stritch shows up with a bit part at the end of the film that is a lot of fun.

Overall, ""Monster-in-Law"" isn't a groundbreaking film by any means, but it's good for a few laughs. (Hopefully it will earn Fonda a few more movie roles...she has a knack for slapstick comedy.)",1126396800,6,1584,4.7773722627737225
2355929,2,B000A343RI,"I'm borrowing from another review when I say that it's not so much that the movie stinks, it's just that it's so frustratingly pedestrian.  I had the same thought about 'Maid in Manhattan' actually (and mentioned so in an earlier Amazon review); it's not so much that the film is flat-out bad, I just feel like I've seen it a dozen times already.

Lopez, in particular I'm REALLY disappointed with.  To be completely honest, I know it's almost fashionable to dislike her, but I think J Lo has (or had) genuine ability.  Let's face it, she's played the same role so many times already that she could do her character ""Charlie"" sleep-walking.  How many romantic comedies is this woman going to do?  I feel like it's been such a long time since I've seen Lopez do ANYTHING that would stretch her talent.  I'm dying to see the same actress that caught my attention in 'Out of Sight' and 'The Cell.'  As it stands now though, she's DANGEROUSLY close to flushing a once-promising acting career into typecast hell.

As for Jane Fonda, do you really mean to tell me that after a 15-year hiatus, THIS is the film that inspired your comeback?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but you HAVE won an Academy Award right?  THIS is the film that you just HAD TO MAKE?  I can't get my brain around it; it just doesn't make any sense.  Did you owe someone a favor?

Michael Vartan is kind of a mystery to me.  I'm told he's awesome in `Alias', I never saw the show though, so I don't have a lot of history to judge him on.  Not that it really made any difference, after the first twenty or so minutes he's shuffled so far into the background that he almost becomes irrelevant.

To close, I couldn't possibly recommend this.  There isn't ANYTHING here that hasn't been seen or done before or is even the least bit interesting.  It's as much of a clich as a rom-com can possibly be.",1126310400,2,1855,4.4188790560471976

2355931,2,B000A343RI,"I didn't like this movie at all, and I thought it was simply not very funny.  However, I gave it two stars because I generally save the one star rating for movies that are truly terrible and have some great flaw.  This film, however, simply seems to run through the basic formula for a comedy, yet didn't really have many funny scenes or characters.

Jane Fonda was very weak, and I think they just brought her on board to use her name on the marquee.  She overacts in every scene she's in, and she just doesn't have a strong comic presence.  Jennifer Lopez plays her typical role, so if you're a fan of hers you'll probably like her here.  I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of hers, but she's not bad.  Michael Vartan is definitely a bit player in this film, but he does well.  He comes across as likeable and fits the role better than most actors could.

The plot is actually not that bad, but in a comedy even a good plot needs some funny scenes for support.  This movie was lacking in funny scenes.  The closest it ever got to funny was some over-the-top silliness that usually involved drastic expressions on the face of Lopez or Fonda.

I predit that we'll see Michael Vartan getting more and more popular, and that Jennifer Lopez will continue her successful career, but it's obvious that Jane Fonda's career is dead in the water.

Unless your a big Lopez fan, I'd skip this film and look for better offerings.",1126137600,,1422,4.3816793893129775

For Jennifer Lopez fans, there is enough sweetness factor to keep them happy. The plot is familiar and formulamatic, yet light and often funny. Charlie (Lopez) has lead a life of many part time jobs and is getting along just fine till she has a chance meeting with Dr. Kevin Fields (played a bit woodenly by Alias' Michael Vartan)and falls in love. Things couldn't be better until Kevin arranges for Charlie to meet his mother, Viola Fields (Fonda)a talk show host put out to pasture by her network and recently released after a break down from a hospital who has nothing left in life but making her son's prespective dates miserable. Kevin chooses to ask Charlie to marry him in front tof his mother and the hijinks begin. Viola has other plans and is hell bent to break them up. But as misery loves company, Charlie decides to fight back. Throw in Wanda Sykes as Viola's personal assistant who wants no part in this struggle and this makes for some very comical moments. Sykes is great in her small role but really chews on the scenery and makes the most of a role written far to small for this large comedic talent. The movie is largely entertaining but you may want to rent it before actually making the purchase. Worth a viewing at least.",1126051200,13,1403,4.463035019455253
2355933,1,B000A343RI,"Here we have Jane Fonda playing Candace Bergen playing Murphy Brown on a bad hair day.  This come back movie for Jane was a real come down, but then she didn't have far to fall.  Fonda reflects every man she has ever been married to or hung out with.  Nudie films for Roger Vadim, a hippie anti American with Tom Hayden, a business woman who satirizes her past with Ted Turner, and who knows made her turn to religion (if you believe that), and now again a hippie anti American trying to get past the aging actress routine.  Fonda just is not that good with comedy.  Though she is a bit better than Jennifer Lopez who is even harder to believe in  her role. Lopex has two facial expressions and I can't recall the second one.  Not that any acting was required in her role and most any actress could have handled her task. It must have been felt that Fonda might not cut the mustard, she didn't, and that Lopex would add some sex appeal, she didn't.  The one redeeming feature was Michael Vartan who proved he can do more than star on TV playing a straight man to an action heroine.  After appearing with these two lades he likely wishes he had used an ""alias"" in the film credits.  The script idea wasn't bad, though not all that new.

2355936,3,B000A343RI,"Through marriage, many acquire an extended family, which can be one of two things - likeable or unwanted.  The horror stories of the in-laws are a common myth, which even made it to the silver screen through the entertaining Meet the Parents (2000), and the sequel Meet the Fockers (2004).  One thing that is certain when directing a comedy with the intention of approaching the in-laws is that it has to focus on satire.  In Monster-in-Law the viewers will receive a spoof of the in-law situation from the perspective of a woman.

The goodhearted Charlotte 'Charlie' Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) bumps into Dr. Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan) on the beach where both exchange extended looks.  A couple of hours later she runs into him in a coffee shop.  Amazed by the encounters, the superstitious Charlie tells her two best friends about the man she has seen.  On a later occasion, she meets Kevin for a third time, and this time they introduce themselves to each other.  The rest is rather self-explanatory, until the audience meets Kevin's mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda).

The seven times nominated and two time Oscars winner - Jane Fonda - for best actress returns to the silver screen after 15 years of absence.  Fonda's performance is as usual-brilliant, and it is clear that she has not lost her step while absent.  Here in Monster-in-Law she plays a laid-off talk show hostess with an age phobia that has flared out into a psychotic neurosis.  After the character's introduction, Viola is released from a mental institution after having assaulted a Britney Spears look-alike after having found out that the television network has released her.  Still unstable, she learns about her son's engagement to Charlie, which triggers a regression into her psychotic neurosis.

The film focuses on Viola's psychopathic approach to Charlie, as she attempts to break up the engagement before the upcoming wedding.  Through violent fits and malignant words, Viola begins to affect Charlie who gives her best effort to make her future husband happy by enduring the abusive presence of her future mother-in-law.  It is in these satirical moments where the film falters, as the language and jokes are a little too pleasant for the nature of the story.  However, Wanda Sykes steps in and saves some comic moments with her supporting part, as Viola's assistant Ruby.  Despite Sykes' presence and Fonda's radiant performance, the film does not reach the potential the story possesses.

Monster-in-Law has the foundation and cast for a terrific comedy, but does not reach its potential.  Several aspects of the film could be improved, but it is too late, as the film has already reached the shelves of the video stores.  The major setback is the poor use of satire, as it becomes too nice to be funny.  However, enough laughter, smiles, and a little bit of drama surface in the film in order to keep the viewer's interest.  The greatest injustice in the film is how Fonda returns to the silver screen in a mediocre film, as she has the talent help make good films great.  In retrospect, Fonda, Lopez, and Sykes converge in an average film without much nourishment for the thoughtful, as the satire misfires.",1125619200,6,3196,4.941947565543071

As in the past, J.Lo is completely unbelievable and plays the part way too cute.  She is also paired off with a bland, white guy with whom she has zero chemistry.  (When was the last time J.Lo had on-screen chemistry with anyone?)  And she has surrounded herself with a cast of far more talented actors or comedians (in this case, Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes) who steal the movie from her and are the real reason to watch the film.  I laughed more than I expected during this film, but none of the laughs were courtesy of J.Lo.  This film clearly belongs to Fonda and Sykes.

Fonda looks ravishing for someone approaching her seventies and she chews up the screen; one wishes she was even more used than she is.  Lopez plays cute and feisty well, but she's no match for the seasoned Fonda.  Michael Vartran as the man of both women's dreams, is bland; a better actor might have made his role a little more interesting.  Wanda Sykes is fine in her Whoopi-like role of Fonda's acerbic assistant.  There's little that goes on in this likeable farce that you wouldn't expect, but the fun comes in watching Jane at her comedic best.",1125619200,4,894,4.7727272727272725
2355940,1,B000A343RI,"Oh my.. what a let down. The first 65 minutes of this movie is just painful to watch. A much used and recycled script using different actors.

The film starts to have a little potential when Lopez finally realized she is being played and retaliates.  However, no sooner does this happen when Lopez then reveals her hand and the potential is gone. The final 20 minutes of the movie just gets slowly more painful with each passing minute.

How anyone can describe this movie as 'Outrageously Funny' is beyond me.. they must have been living in France for the last 20 years.  The only bright spark of the movie is Fonda's assistant, Wanda Sykes, who has some very good throw-away lines.",1125532800,2,814,4.593103448275862

2355942,3,B000A343RI,"It had been fifteen years since Jane Fonda made ""Stanley & Iris"" with Robert De Niro.  Then she sort of retired to be Ted Turner's wife, which actually ended up being a longer gig than most people thought.  Then at some point in the last couple of years she must have decided she wanted to make movies again, or at least one more movie, and apparently she has fallen so far from being a two-time Academy Award winner, daughter of Henry Fonda, and the space babe ""Barbarella,"" that all she could get was ""Monster-in-Law.""  This is certainly a sorry state of affairs, but then De Niro made ""Meet the Fockers"" last year, so maybe this really was the best script Fonda could get.

The idea of Jane Fonda as the (future) mother-in-law from Hell for Jennifer Lopez sounds good at face value.  Why not?  The idea of the mother-in-law from Hell is old as the hills.  The problem is that screenwriter Anya Kochoff is not and this script, her first screenwriting credit, is basically a decent first draft.  There are a few big laughs in the movie, but if you are going to bring Jane Fonda back from the dead to make a film with J Lo you want something worth watching a second time, and that ""Monster-in-Law"" is not.

This one goes off the tracks when we meet the two characters.  Lopez is Charlotte call me ""Charlie"" Cantilini, who does temp jobs and walks dogs to get by.  Her horoscope tells her that love is right in front of her and when she looks up there is Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan).  That would be too easy, so they have to keep on meeting until they finally exchange names and move in together.  Meanwhile, we learn that Viola Field (Jane Fonda) was a Barbara Walters type television personality who was summarily fired for being too old and allowed to broadcast one more show so that she could become unhinged on national TV and have to be institutionalized.

Okay, so we know that Charlie is nice and that Viola can go off the deep end.  The question is why, when Kevin brings Charlie home to meet Viola and both his girl friend and his mother by proposing marriage, does Viola decide to try and destroy Charlie?  Apparently it is not because she is overly protective of the son she has been ignoring during her busy career, but rather because she violently throttled one young woman so why not do it again?  Because otherwise Viola would have to be racist or elitist or a combination thereof.  Still, the simplest explanation for why Viola does what she does is that the script was written that way.  You want character motivation, go back to doing movies that will get you nominated for an Oscar.

I agree with the idea that Charlie should fight back, but almost as soon as the movie starts down that path it abandons it.  Charlie overplays her hand and then Fate makes things take an ugly turn, and then the last act of the movie plays it straight by the numbers without trying to connect the dots so that the obligatory moment of reconciliation actually makes sense.  Yeah, it is a nice little speech, as Ruby (Wanda Sykes), Viola's assistant, notes, but it would be more effective if it was a culmination of what comes previously and not just a two-minute warning that the film is almost over.

Vartan is given nothing to do besides look good and stay out of the way of the ladies who have their names over the title.  But Sykes is really wasted in this one.  Almost all of her dialogue consists of muttered comic asides, because since she is speaking the truth she cannot really be heard by Viola until the end of the film, otherwise the movie avoids a lot of nonsense and it needs a new title.  Credits to J Lo for doing the bit with the lips, but somebody should have asked for at least a rewrite if not some major script doctoring on this forgettable 2005 comedy.  At least Fonda has to make another movie after this one, because otherwise film historians will be saying, yes, Bela Lugosi's last film was Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" but Jane Fonda finished her career by making ""Monster-in-Law.""",1125446400,2,4018,4.491059147180192

And for this legend, who is Jane Fonda, a genius of an actor, seeing her spew these awful lines in this pathetic script was so beneath her I can't even begin to describe.

For example when Fonda would often imagine doing something terrible to Lopez, like smashing her face in a cake.

2355950,3,B000A343RI,"I saw this film in theaters, even though I didn't expect much. I'm a fan of Jane Fonda and from the previews, she looked like she was back in fine form. The irony of the role is that she plays a self-absorbed, high-profile Barbara Walters-type television personality who becomes unhinged when her son (played by Michael Vartan) meets and engages himself to a woman (Jennifer Lopez) that Viola (Fonda) considers far beneath him. Like other romantic comedies, Jennifer has the habit of choosing the poor little lonely/working class girl (see ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan""). I agree that the chemistry between J.Lo and Michael Vartan simply wasn't there. They don't seem much of a pair, had little in common, and gee...some lady at a party is going to tell her that the man she has the hots for is gay, and she believes her? Pathetic! This film could have been a lot better if they casted someone else. Because Jennifer Lopez's acting is dreadful, I ended up rooting for the slightly psychotic Jane Fonda as we see imagined scenes of Fonda bashing Lopez's face into a cake. I loved it!

What saves this film from being a complete disaster and waste of time, though, is Wanda Sykes. She steals every scene with her comedic commentary. She and Jane Fonda make an excellent pair, and I found that I wanted the film to be more about those two. We simply don't see enough of Michael Vartan to get a sense of why he is so enamored of Jennifer Lopez. Perhaps it was all based on looks and a secret desire to upset his mother and show that he is master of his own life. By the end, there's the obligatory twist that supposedly redeems Viola to the audience as we see why she is the way she is, but it's a mere contrivance to this piece of tripe.

The special features added to this dvd make it worth renting, just to watch them...but to own this dvd? How many times can you stand to watch Jennifer Lopez act? She's a better singer than actress and this film finally convinced me of it. I don't ever plan to watch a film with Jennifer Lopez in it again. She may look good, but I'm tired of her role choices and flat acting. When I watch her, I'm never lost in her character, because all I can see is Jennifer Lopez trying to be someone she's not with unconvincing results.

Fonda actually handles her role well. She plays it totally over the top (she has said she based her performance on Ted Turner). Lopez handles her role well and is as beautiful as ever. She just doesn't match the grand charisma of Fonda and Sykes.

I thought J.Lo's movie ""Enough"" had fighting and violence, this movie is just a battle royal between J.lo's and jane fonda's character.

The Plot is charlie(jennier lopez) is getting married to jane fonda's character's son. But it's a pretty bad time to do so since she is a barbara walters type tv host and assaults a female pop singer on stage for being so ignorant plus she likes to hit the bottle. When J.F's character comes out of Rehab she finds out her son is getting married to charlie  she doesnt like it. And she will risk going to jail to get her out of the picture.

The way these two females duke it out throughout the movie and you see the ways they try to make each others life hell is entertaining alone. See poisoning attempts, expensive clothes destroyes, insults, and so many more entertaining scenes.

I highly recommend this movie for a rental, and if you get alot of pleasure of seeing movies over and over again well then buy it.
This is jennifer lopez's best movie(thats saying alot) and it shows jane fonda to a younger generation.
Just please Dont try the stunts you see in this movie on your mother in law or daughter in law, you might go to jail!

This is the third movie I've seen with Jennifer Lopez. I will NEVER watch another one. She cannot act. She has as much screen presence as a door knob.

It seems that Ms. Lopez has gained some weight since her last movie. Is it necessary for the cameraman to draw so much attention to her large rear? The camerman should also keep the camera off of Ms. Lopez's bare feet - too big.

Was this movie supposed to be a comedy? Why was the ""assistant"" portrayed as a black dialect speaking woman? What professional woman would have an ""assistant"" like that? Stereotyped blacks are so out of date.

Jennifer Lopez seems to specialize in making movies where she, as a poor girl, marries a rich guy. I guess there is a market for this kind of movie but the class and cultural differences shown in the movie were so obvious even suspended logic cannot make this movie enjoyable. This movie was not a ""Pretty Woman.""

Michael Vartan starts as Dr. Kevin Fields, the only son of T.V. talk show host Viola Fields (Fonda), think Sally Jessy Raphael but meaner.

On the eve of her television show's cancellation, Viola is overwhelmed by the announcement of her son's engagement to 'Charlie' Charlotte Cantilini, a part-time dog walker, part-time receptionist, and part-time temp employee.  Believing that there is no way her son can fall for a TEMP, Viola finagles her way into Kevin and Charlie's life with one goal in mind, to stop this wedding at all cost.

After numerous events and incidents used to belittle and embarrass Charlie, the crowning epiphany is finally achieved when Viola interacts with her own mother-in-law on the day of Charlie and Kevin's wedding.

The sentimental poppycock aside, this film isn't as awful as you would think.  Fonda looks stunning on screen, which is truly exceptional taking in the fact that she was born in 1937.  I wouldn't rush out to see this film; however, I would recommend renting it.

2355964,3,B000A343RI,"When dog-walker / caterer / clothing-designer / temp / try-every-job-you-can Charlotte ""Charlie"" Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) sees Doctor Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan) for the first time, she imagines there is something different about him: he seems to be unlike all the other men she has dated in the past. After Charlie and Kevin run into each other a few times as ""fate"" brings them together on various occasions (in a coffee shop, on the beach, at a party), they decide to quite goggling and eying each other and actually speak for the first time. Kevin asks Charlie on a date, and although hesitant at first, she soon agrees: they end up having a blast together! Charlie is free-spirited and fun-loving, while Kevin is more serious (the perfect complement to one another). As they begin dating more and more often, things seem to be going very well. They date, they date some more, they move in together, and Charlie thinks she just might have found the perfect man.

But then a wrench is thrown into the fairy tale: Kevin's mother. Enter Viola Fields (Jane Fonds), a recently fired news anchor (replaced by a much younger woman); she went over the deep end a few months ago, and is now back with a vengeance. Back in her son's life, calling multiple times a day, and interfering with this choices and decisions. Kevin takes Charlie to meet his beloved mother, and perceives them as getting along fabulously.  Internally, Viola is imagining physically hurting Charlie (hair pulling, face slapping), but unaware Kevin decides to propose to Charlie then and there, in front of his ""adoring"" and interfering mother. Viola is obviously totally taken aback but seems to be handling it well; she ""celebrates"" their news while throwing subtle verbal barbs Charlie. She waits until Kevin and Charlie are gone and then gains the help of her long-time personal assistant Ruby (Wanda Sykes), to help her carry out her crazy and caustic anti-wedding machinations.

Sweet Charlie is soon taken aback at the vicious yet underlying attacks of her new mother-in-law-to-be. She feels like she can't really talk to Kevin about it, as he loves his mother. The one time she tried, Kevin just told her that he knows his mom is difficult, but to try to be more patient with her. He knows his mom is attached to him: he just doesn't know to what lengths she will go! When Charlie gets fed up with Viola's antics and starts to fight back, things get interesting. It's quite a ride watching Charlie and Viola struggle for the ""control"" and love of one man: Kevin.

Content: There is lots of fighting between two of the movie's characters, some real and some imagined, including hair-pulling, name-calling, hitting, ""accidentally"" poisoning, etc.  An unmarried guy and girl move in together, and behave intimately. (They start a dirty conversation over the phone, roll around on the couch, and trade innuendo.) There's a homosexual sub-character that winds up dating another man. There's also some language, and dogs behaving sexually.

Unfortunately, just when the movie seemed to be getting good, they decided to completely skip over the part where Charlie and Kevin get to know one another (I was really enjoying that), and went straight to where Charlie and her new ""in-law-to-be"" meet and start cat fighting. It was a bit disappointing, as at that point I'm not completely sold on Charlie and Kevin's ""true"" love yet (why is Charlie putting up with such a completely crazy mother-in-law-to-be! is Kevin really worth it?!) I did enjoy it though, and found myself laughing quite a bit at the antics, while gasping in disbelief in others. Overall, a cute and entertaining film that gets a bit serious at the end, but mostly is just played out for outrageous laughs: somewhat recommended by this reviewer as a decently funny and entertaining film to rent on a rainy day.",1118016000,,3848,4.903225806451613

Fonda, bumped from her job as a Barbara Walters-like newswoman at the beginning of the movie, comes in roaring like a lion, in order to protect her relationship with her only son.  Lopez at first tries to please her, but seeing that this is a hopeless task, she eventually takes the offensive with a few tricks of her own.

All the actors tried too hard to be funny, although Fonda was certainly the more experienced one, occasionally delivering humorous scenes. The cliches were the most grating thing about the movie. The excentric gay friend. The nasty and aggressive blonde who loves the leading man. The hot doctor who is over the top cheesy (NO guy could EVER describe a girl's eyes like that). The sassy african-american assistant (think Miss Congeniality 2 but not as funny).

Viola decides to sabotage Kevin and Charlie's relationship, because as a temp, Charlie isn't good enough for her son.  Kevin seems not to notice how horrible his mother is, and proceeds to believe every word she says, and moves her in with them.  What follows is a typical laugh-making one-upmanship between Charlie and Viola.

That relationship was established pretty quickly. The main thrust of the movie is the relationship between Lopez and (duh!) her future Mother-in-Law, played by Jane Fonda, who hasn't been in a theatrical release since 1990.

I didn't think the movie wasn't as bad as Roger Ebert thought it was, but it wasn't good, either.

2355976,3,B000A343RI,"""Monster-In-Law"" is not the train wreck I was expecting, but it could've been so much more.

Charlie (Jennifer Lopez) works a series of temp jobs and enjoys everything she does, making ends meet. It makes life interesting. One day, she meets Kevin (Michael Vartan), a doctor, and they quickly fall in love. Kevin's Mom is Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), a successful Barbara Walters-like network news anchor, with problems of her own. Kevin brings Charlie to his mother's estate to meet her. Kevin decides to propose, in front of his mother. Viola clearly disapproves and sets about breaking them up. As she and Ruby (Wanda Sykes), her assistant, set a series of events in motion, Charlie gradually begins to realize what she is working against and fights back.

""Monster-In-Law"", directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blond"", ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!""), frequently veers into sitcom territory.

The acting is very broad and cartoonish. At one point, Charlie, having pulled one off on Viola, shakes her head and sniggers, much like a Hanna Barbera cartoon character. Lopez's character is all over the place. At one moment, she appears to be normal and caring and sympathetic, the other, she is acting like Peg Bundy from ""Married with Children"". Fonda, returning to feature films after 15 years, is clearly having fun chewing the scenery. And it is fun to watch her. But she is so over the top and Lopez is over the top only part of the time, that it seems like a bad sitcom. Wanda Sykes is very funny as Ruby. Her natural allegiance is with Viola, someone she has worked with for years, maybe decades, but she isn't beyond dressing down her boss, pointing out the problems with her theories. When she realizes that this isn't going to stop her boss, and Charlie is a stronger adversary, she begins to root a little for her. Michael Vartan (from TVs ""Alias"") is a very handsome guy, but he is virtually non-existent in this film. He is such a flat, boring character that he gets completely lost in the wake of Hurricane Fonda and Tropical Storm Lopez.

The film would've worked better if the two lead actresses were more complimentary. As Fonda chews the scenery, Lopez moves from trying to portray a real woman to matching the overblown antics of her co-star. It might have been more successful if one of the two were cartoonish while the other was more natural. Providing more balance to the proceedings. Or, if they were equally outlandish. As it is, the film seems unbalanced. Strange.

This sort of story naturally lends itself to a darker tone, but the filmmakers have steered clear of that. If the story moves slightly towards ""dark territory"", it quickly veers back into the safe and sunny territory everyone feels was necessary to earn the film mass acceptance. At one point, Viola is so fed up with Charlie that she is about to smash up some almonds and slip them into Charlie's food. Earlier, Charlie remarked that she was allergic to nuts. Ruby talks her out of it. Why does she have to talk Viola out of it? The story sets up that Viola is more than a little egomaniacal, more than a little crazy, more than a little excessive. It seems like her character would go through with something like this, no matter what. They pull Viola back because they want her to remain sympathetic, for the sappy, sweet ending.

I did laugh. More than I expected to. Much of this laughter was created by Wanda Sykes. Ruby is the type of all-knowing character every lead used to have. Think Thelma Ritter in the 50s. A couple of her one-liners made me laugh out loud.

Because the filmmakers pull the punches, they rob the film of any dark humor and relegate it to the annals of forgettable comedies on the shelf of every video store throughout the country.

From all of the horrible reviews I have read, I was expecting ""Monster-In-Law"" to be completely dreadful. I was surprised that I found myself laughing at the absurd situations. Certainly worth checking out on video, but a bargain matinee is pushing it.",1116288000,47,4005,4.7277936962750715

Anyone remember JERSEY GIRL? ANGEL EYES? ENOUGH? Or, most offensive, GIGLI? Jennifer Lopez cannot act. Her remarkable turn in OUT OF SIGHT was evidently a happy accident.

One reviewer regales us with his gushing experience at the star-studded premiere. So dazzled by all of the wandering celebrities, the reviewer must have became oblivious to the pablum oozing from the movie screen.

This is filmmaking at its most commercial and inane. The plot is contrived, predictable and prepostrous. Lopez gives another less-than stellar performance. Fonda should have stuck to fitness videos. The male lead is forgettable (see?).

2355981,4,B000A343RI,"Monster-In-Law is Jane Fonda's first movie in 15 years, and it's clear that she had made her best effort to turn in a fabulous comeback performance. This is not her kind of movie, but she's surprisingly funny and her outragerously striking performance easily dominated this movie that was supposed to be Jennifer Lopez's box office redemption for Gigli and Jersey Girl. Jane and Jen trully had one hell of a time in this laugh-out-loud comedy.

Charlette(Jen) is middle class office telephone operator/dog walker/aspiring artist and fashion designer, and when she met  Kevin(Michael Varton) who is a doctor, they fall madly in love after dating for two months. Meanwhile, Kevin's mother Viola(Jane) is being let go by the network. She's a multi-award winning TV host and had a circle of friends ranged from celebrities to international politicians. During her final night of hosting her show, she looses control of herself while interviewing a teen idol ala Britney Spear, and verbally and physically attacked the intellectually ignorant girl just because she didn't read newspapers and still managed to sell 5 million albums. Not only does she have to accept the lost of her career, she also has to deal with possibly losing her only son to her future daughter-in-law.

Since Viola is an extreme stuckup and saw nothing in Charlette that fit the bill of the ideal bride for her son, she intended to do whatever it takes to sabatage their relationship so that they wouldn't be able to make it to their possible wedding day. Even though Charlette tried her best to please Viola, it didn't impress her a bit. In the course of the following weeks, she relentlessly tormented Charlette in hoping that she would back out of the engagement. She would manipulate her, make her feel unworthy, and even attack her in bed while pretending a nightmare stunt.

Then Charlette and her two friends uncovered Viola's secret agenda and decided a retaliation. That's when the real showdown between Jane and Jen takes place. While the two are having battles, Kevin is not even aware of what's really happening.

Jane Fonda gets to deliver most of the funniest lines and she's very glamorous in this movie. She's even funnier than another out of control woman played by Joan Allen in The Upside of Anger. Even though Jennifer Lopez is sweet and charming in this movie, but her scenes with Michael Varton are not romantic enough, and she gets upstaged by the more powerful Jane Fonda most of time.",1115942400,2,2477,4.916267942583732
