3912650,3,B002DU39JE,"Phoebe MacNamara, hard-driven cop, and Duncan Swift, handsome millionaire, are about as close to J. D. Robb's (Nora Roberts' alter ego) Eve Dallas and Roarke as we are likely to find onscreen recently. Eve works in the future, Phoebe works in the present, but they are pretty much the same woman: living on caffeine, junk food and passion, driving herself to exhaustion in pursuit of a killer. (For JD Robb fans: Phoebe even refers to ""Captain Feeney"" at one point). Duncan is her Roarke, a wealthy man who drives her to crime scenes in fast cars, buys whole amusement parks for her entertainment, and falls in love with her. They have plenty of sparks, but don't really catch fire in this movie. The trouble is that I just don't see all that much attraction in Duncan. Ivan Sergei does his level best, but he is not given much to work with; we never really figure out exactly what it is he sees in Phoebe. Worse, the explanation for his relationship with a black family never comes out, which would have added depth to the character. Cybill Shepherd is wonderful and warm as Phoebe's agoraphobic mother, while Olivia Cheng stands out as feisty, kick-ass investigator Liz Alberta.

The police procedural is very well done, but the romance sort of just sits there: no sizzle, no spark, and not much motivation for either party to fall in love. I enjoyed the movie, and of course Roberts always has to get her movie references in (""High Noon""), and I will probably watch this movie several times. But it's not the best adaptation to the screen of Roberts' work that I've seen. Buy it used, and you'll get a good deal.",1308614400,,1615,4.627177700348432

3912653,3,B002DU39JE,I love Nora Roberts books and I am so glad that they were chosen to be made into movies.  I have most of the other dvd's in her series but I was very disappointed in this one.  There was so much that was missing in the movie that was in the book.  First of all the house should have been a showplace to symbolize her gilded cage.  Second off where was Ava the longtime friend and housekeeper and what happened to her brother.  They did not even discuss that at all.  The part where she was at the cemetary where her ex Roy gets blown up -not Duncan's car. Very disappointed in this remake of the book.  I think a lot of the story line was missing that would have added to the movie.  That is just my opinion!,1287705600,3,708,4.043165467625899

3912656,4,B002DU39JE,"Although for the movie ""High Noon"", this applies to most of the available movies in this series of movies based on Nora Robert's mystery books.
I got these for my wife, and..., well...., I like them too!
As with many on TV movies (usually on Lifetime and Hallmark), these are much better to watch minus all the commercials. None of the DVD's we've gotten have had any 'extras' of any kind expect for the occasional previews.
All have been interesting and of the versions we've seen and read the book of also, they have stayed pretty true to those stories.
Overall, pretty people (only the best looking current actors and actresses) following some interesting story lines. Some semi-sexy parts thrown in, a crisis or two and then a happy 'boy gets girl' ending. Whats not to like for occasional entertainment?",1267574400,5,808,4.7785714285714285

3912658,4,B002DU39JE,"I enjoy reading Nora Roberts, especially the ones with a bit of a mystery & was curious to see how the movies were.  This one, to me, didn't disappoint.  It has the mystery angle - female police detective being stalked by a mystery person, then some Hot Romance chucked in, it also had a bit humour too - just to add to the fun.  The actors and their chemistry together was great to watch.  All in all, a bit of everything.  If you're looking for a girly flick with a bit of suspense - check this one out!!",1258243200,12,506,4.122448979591836

3912759,4,B002DU39JE,"This story based on the book by Nora Roberts and directed by Peter Markle concerns police hostage negotiator Lt. Phoebe McNamara (Emilie de Ravin). Now divorced, she lives with her daughter Carly (Savanna Carlson) and her agoraphobic mum Essie (Cybill Shepherd). In a morning briefing to her colleagues Phoebe is antagonized by policeman Arnie Meeks (Patrick Sabonqui) and this confrontation escalates into physical assault after Phoebe reprimands his handling of a hostage situation.  When Phoebe is further terrorized, Meeks is the prime suspect. Phoebe has the support of her new boyfriend Duncan Swift (Ivan Sergei), her friend detective Liz Alberta (Olivia Cheng) and that of her captain, David McVee (Brian Markinson), so Meeks is dismissed. But someone (Meeks?) is out to really make Phoebe's life difficult, even to the extent of threatening her ex-husband. The film gets its title from the fact that her stalker walks past Phoebe's house at night whistling the theme of the classic Western `High Noon'.

3912765,3,B002DU39JE,"I am a Nora Roberts junkie, addict, pick an adjective!  I have read every one of her books. I'd give the books 5 stars but it would probably be impossible to make any of them into a 5 star movie in 1 1/2 hours.  I just 'liked' the movie.  I found Emilie De Ravin unbelievable in the role of Phoebe.  Her acting in this movie felt slow and hesitant which a police lieutenant would never be.  I did love Ivan Sergei as Duncan Swift but was disappointed they didn't elaborate more on his character but as an attractive, romantic, caring, love interest he was very believable.

Cybill Shepherd stars as Phoebe's mother who suffers from agoraphobia but her acting also seemed slow and her lines felt just a beat behind where they should have been (I think this may be an editing issue).  It made it hard to completely sink into the movie the way I do Nora Robert's books.

If you love Nora's books you will probably want to see the movies, I can't get enough of the books, but don't expect too much from the movies.  I watched, then went right back to the newest release to get my fix (in book form).",1334793600,,1095,4.302439024390244
