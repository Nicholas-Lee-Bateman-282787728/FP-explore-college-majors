todays political conversation should be judged. This is serious commentary without the dogma  relied upon by politicians today .",1375660800,,231,4.775

3545705,5,B001E52U7G,The exchange of ideas and the quality of the questions showed these two intellects at their best. Hope there will be more of this recorded programs.,1359763200,,148,4.730769230769231
3545706,5,B001E52U7G,Muggeridge watched Europe change from his perspective of working in India and then for the ILO in Switzerland....he was an Internationalist who was also a seer.,1355356800,,160,5.1923076923076925
3545707,5,B001E52U7G,"I had hoped to find Malcolm Muggeridge more thought-provoking 40 years later and was rewarded. Not only is this the first Firing Line encounter with this formidable defender of Christianity since Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, taped in the Savoy Hotel in England, but one of the most challenging to keep up with. Beginning with liberalism and the Left and the noteable shadings of meaning between Mr. Buckely and Mr. Muggeridge as to their own homelands, they both take off covering good and evil, Anglican church foibles, the relevance of the New Testament gospels etc.; the disillusion and wanderings of youth via transcendentalism, the Beatles and meditation; Harold Wilson, Gladstone, Conrad Adenauer. Unexpectedly into this exploration of spirituality Mr. Buckley uttered one of his startling phrases that I had read in one of his books,""immenatize the eschaton,"" that caused no pause in the absorbing exchange of information between the devout Mr. Buckley and this illumator from the British Isles. Not only will this discussion whet your appetite for more Muggeridge clarity on Christianity, but you will observe and hear one of Mr. Buckley's most impressive put-downs of youthful naivete in the closing question period with some university students who were suspiciously sensitive about Mr. Muggeridge's criticism about the Maharishi. A delicious repartee worthy of Edward Everett Horton, no less. Levels above talk show fare today.",1239062400,28,1433,5.401785714285714

8296426,5,B001E52U7G,I like every Firing Line program.  Intelligent debate in a free society.  I don't agree or disagree.  I learn and enjoy.,1447027200,,120,4.619047619047619
8296427,5,B001E52U7G,"I find this episode very thought provoking and intellectually stimulating. Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge and Mr. William Buckley Jr. engage in pleasant confabulations about politics, power, culture, and religion. Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge, in all his satire and wit shares his rather interesting perspectives that challenge the axioms of that time and place, of course, along with the cocksure college/university students who are seemingly aware of Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge's presence find him rather a contradictory and cantankerous personality, but nonetheless, illustrious. I recommend this, and all videos of Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge and William Buckley Jr., because it is these views that help us understand more of where our world is headed.",1445299200,2,733,5.73394495412844
8296428,5,B001E52U7G,"However you feel about Buckley and his flavor of conservatism, if only the shrill lunatics at Fox could approach their subjects and arguments with this level of intelligence I could at least say it's worth the time spent watching and listening.

TV generally,and conservative talk and ""news"" particularly, has clearly suffered a great decline in quality, integrity and intelligence since Buckley's time.  I still find it astonishing that, in the last decade or so, the ""Right"" has so enthusiastically embraced an irrationalist epistemology (i.e. all 'facts' are merely politically informed and motivated opinions), an intellectual maneuver that was, until the last twenty years or so, exclusively the domain of the left.

Whether or not you agree with him, Firing Line and Buckley are awesome and entertaining viewing, even today.  Highly recommended.",1438992000,,851,5.473282442748092

8296432,5,B001E52U7G,"I AM ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WHAT MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE SAYS. EVEN WHEN I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH ABOUT BRITISH POLITICS, I FIND HIM QUITE HONEST, ENLIGHTENING, AND SOMETIMES INADVERTANTLY HUMOROUS!",1386201600,,191,5.620689655172414
8296433,5,B001E52U7G,"Buckley is without equal, both as a provocative interviewer and as an author. Muggeridge is a truly unique and equally provocative character, whose path the Christianhood was marked by interesting trails, nonetheless the admiration and brotherly love shared by these accomplished men comes to life in this Firing Line video.",1377129600,,324,5.5
