2566907,5,B000FIHN8O,"As the other earlier reviewers have said this was a great show, cut way to early. Many inferior shows with the same premise, Aliens, made it the entire season. This one should never have been cut, excellent acting, good episodes that could stand on their own. I still hold out slim hope it will be picked up by FX or USA network.

I'm looking forward to picking up the DVD set.",1149033600,36,377,4.309859154929577
2566908,5,B000FIHN8O,"It's really too bad this show had to be cancelled so soon. It was a simple formula, but it worked very well. The storylines were engaging, the cast was outstanding and every episode had you on the edge of your seat. Not only can you see the episodes that aired during the show's brief run on CBS, but you can also see the ones that never made it to the air on this set. Not to mention that the box art is insanely cool. So pick up these DVDs and discover this awesome show",1148860800,162,472,4.031914893617022
2566909,5,B000FIHN8O,"Well, now that I have written it down, that does look odd, but there were so many series last year where the premise was that aliens were among us, messing with us somehow.  And this, the first casualty of the season, was the best of the bunch. Well written, great acting, thoughtful, intelligent, creepy and above all realistic.  My first heartbreak of the 05 season was when this show was cancelled",1148515200,153,400,4.619718309859155

2566912,3,B000FIHN8O,"Barely worth watching once.  For me, the flaw was that the better actors were not the main actors.  Brent Spiner, Rob Benedict and Peter Dinklage worked out an enjoyable synergy which could not overcome Carla Gugino's and Charles Dutton's wooden interactions.

I have been following Carla Gugino and think she is great in this interesting role. Brent Spiner is delightful as the grouchy doctor. Peter Dinklage shows his chops and we don't have to question why he has become a superstar. I liked the role they gave Peter and what he does with it. I hate when height is the whole reason for a character. I am tall and that sort of thing bothers me. It makes Peter interesting but I need much more. His profession, interests, and vices were great. Special Features spoke of using Peter's character for a special ending aboard the alien ship because of his size. Now that is interesting!",1509235200,2,772,4.443661971830986

2566931,3,B000FIHN8O,"The only reason I'm giving this show three stars instead of two is that Peter Dinklage and Brent Spiner do try their best  to deal with the horrible dialogue they're given.  The rest of the acting is mediocre at best. Even Charles Dutton seems like a stoned person trying to read a cue card every time he says something.  But it's not the actors' fault.  Even the best actors in the world (like Peter Dinklage for example)  would struggle with writing this bad.

 Here's an example.  In one scene, an alien-virus-infected maniac kills two people and escapes from a mental institution. The team is sent to investigate. Spiner's line upon hearing what happened: ""I'll bet he comes back when he finds out what happened to rock 'n' roll.""  Not even poor Brent can pull that one off.  Even if the situation was such that a joke was appropriate (it wasn't),  the line just isn't funny. It's not even worth a groan, let alone a chuckle.  And that's just a single example of the idiotic dialogue that saturates this series.

Yet, I enjoy watching it simply because it's a sci-fi show with recognizable people in it. To me, it's entertaining, it's just not good. I'm not surprised it only lasted one season. It only deserved one season. Kudos to Brent Spiner and Peter Dinklage, though, for their efforts.",1472774400,4,1296,4.656387665198238

The show is probably better than 3 stars but I can't tell for sure. I like watching Brent Spiner and Peter Dinklage, and (5 episodes) produce by David Heyman (Harry Potter), so I know it had good potential. There are 13 episodes and a couple of extras.

2566959,4,B000FIHN8O,"I think this conspiracy series a was a little ahead of its time but fortunately has held up well. The conspiracy is that the government has formed a crisis team to fight off a mysterious alien presence from the 4th dimension that is not yet known to the public. You do get to see the conspiracy from the other side as the team is trying to fight both the invasion and to keep it out of the news. At one point, a member looks regretfully at his cell knowing all his data will be wiped out in an EMP set off to clean out an infected area of Miami.

All the team members are smart and entertaining, but I LOVED Brent Spiner as an ex-hippie scientist with multiple alimony checks to write out each month. He is not happy to be part of a government coverup he normally would be fighting. You can also see Peter Dinklage as a credible forensic linguist who also enjoys Vegas a bit too much. Both scientists get into interesting predicaments because of their vices. The 4D crystal entity is also a very intriguing menace. Each person it infects and turns into a zombie has his or her own take on how to take over the planet ranging from infecting crops to messing with trance music tracks.

2566993,4,B000FIHN8O,"""Threshold - The Complete Series""
 . . . .

NOTE: mild spoilers below. don't flip out.
 . . . .

Originally broadcast on CBS in 2005, ""Threshold"" was a decent though swiftly-canceled sci-fi paranoia thriller about an alien invasion with a few cool twists. The most imaginative aspects come early on, with the aliens using pan-dimensional technology to crack into our world, and infecting human minds through a variety of unconventional methods, including a sonic signal that creates a virus-like reaction, warping human thought patterns and DNA to suit the alien design. (This innovative, visionary leap into speculative alterna-tech sadly devolves into more mundane, more easily contained invasion strategies - the aliens infecting our food supply, the aliens colonizing one small town, etc., with a menace-of-the-week format similar to the ""X Files."" While this may make for a more effective, more conventional TV narrative, it undercuts the cutting-edge sci-fi aspects that made the show so exciting in its initial episodes, and makes it less plausible somehow.)

When the alien incursion is first identified, a Scooby gang of misfit scientists is cobbled together based on a containment protocol created by team leader Molly Anne Caffrey, a high-strung but highly capable government super-thinker who games out worst-case scenarios and is just waiting for a zombie plague or an alien invasion to test her theories out. The show falls somewhere between ""X-Files"" and ""Agents Of SHIELD,"" between ""Falling Skies"" and ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers."" A lot of it feels familiar, and it's when the challenging, menacing story arc falls into more conventional TV-serial mode that this familiarity undercuts rather than bolsters the show.

To its credit, ""Threshold"" never lapsed into the absurdity of the ""X-Files"" format, where one week Scully and Mulder are pitted against a vicious alien invasion conspiracy, and the next they're investigating a werewolf that works at a truck stop outside of Akron. ""Threshold"" stays the course on combating its alien invasion, but the frightening scope and technological methods used by the invaders -- spreading a bio-tech virus via cell phones, Internet and other media -- was apparently so radical the shows producers shied away from it, since it left their human protagonists at such a huge tactical disadvantage. So, we get infected tomatoes and crowds at single raves hearing the alien signal over the loudspeakers, rather than the aliens jamming our satellites and sending the signal out globally. This makes a slower-moving and less visceral, less terrifying show, though also one where we can meet the separate characters in the Threshold task force at a more leisurely pace. Speaking of which, I was drawn to this series because I wanted to see what the post-""Station Agent,"" pre-""Game Of Thrones"" Peter Dinklage had been up to... We are also treated to a tart, cynical scientist played by Brent Spiner, and a nervous but appealing physicist played by Rob Benedict, these three being the standouts in the ensemble cast.

""Threshold"" was not a truly great show, but it's engaging sci-fi and offered several unique conceptualizations of parallel, non-Earthian technologies that give it enough of a pseudo-science wow factor to draw fans in, though as noted above the boldest of these ideas come at the very start, and nothing in the rest of the series matches the creepy, spine-tingling ideas in the pilot episode. Still, one suspects that given another season or two, this show really could have gone somewhere. As it is, canceled after only a single season but gathered here in its entirety (including several unaired epidodes) the short-lived ""Threshold"" has its moments and is certainly worth checking out.",1386633600,4,3755,5.248333333333333

Watched all three of them. Invasion was entertaining but Surface was the best of the three.
Surface was getting better and better as the season progressed and had some story lines that had great potential.
Threshold was awful. The casting looked good but the acting did not live up to it. The show was claustrophobic and dull.
The only reason I continued to watch it was out of hope that it would get better...and it was Sci-Fi, although bad Sci-Fi.

Never saw it on television, but shown without commercial breaks and a weekly schedule, it struck me as one of the better serials around. The team brought together to hunt down the Aliens had the usual diverse character but was more interesting than most. The threat was of a customary source but made for a variety of reactions and responses which enlivened the thirteen episodes more than one would have expected. The cross-currents within the group allowed a  neat individuality and good actors made the most of their roles. While it was a bit difficult to accept an egg-head planner (author of THE contingency plan for emergencies) as head of such a team and even more difficult to picture her as the field agent she increasingly became, the actress  playing the part made it appear more natural than I would have imagined. Plots were solid and the performances of the cast got the most out of them. While there were the customary abuses of citizens civil rights by the Anti-Alien team, it was nice to see that these were recognized as such and commented upon (even resisted by members of the team though forced to act in such manner). To what extent the series could have continude with the solid achievement, if it had survived beyond the one season, is moot. At least, we have thirteen enjoyable episodes to keep it alive. (i should mention, particularly, the performances of the multi-talented  Charles S. Dutton, as the Government manager in over-all command, and Carla Gugino, as the egghead in charge of The Team, for providing the glue that held the show together.)",1324944000,,1676,4.713310580204778

A second season might have been more interesting as the characters get fleshed out some more.  However, the ratings for network TV didn't garner the show a second chance.  The alien body snatchers just seem to be gratuitous by the end of the season rather than having an overarching goal.

The scene in which the Gugino character tells the government who she needs on the team is straight out of Armageddon--a montage of those characters being shown recruited in the midst of their eccentric lives while the good Dr. explains how brilliant they are. That idea was itself derivative of that movie Sphere, which had basically the same premise as Threshold--A scientist (Dustin Hoffman) had written a contingency plan in the event of contact with alien life and described the elite team of scientists that would be needed to handle the situation. If you're going to rip something off, at least have the sense to rip off something that was actually GOOD.

The always attractive Gugino is excellent as the brainy and charismatic leader. And great to see Brent Spiner (`Star Trek: The Next Generation') as a scientist, but played straight (unlike, for example, as the kooky scientist in `Independence Day').

Once again, a T.V. show canceled too soon before it has a chance for an audience.  It is a compelling series that introduces the threat of an alien invasion and the implementation of a government plan when it happens.  Many times while watching, I wondered if our government really has a contingency plan for this scenario.

""Threshold"" is comprised of a top secret team of experts led by Dr. Coffey (brilliantly played by Carlo Gugino)to investigate and contain the threat. Brent Spiner (well known for Star Trek: The Next Generation) is amazing as one of the scientists on the team. The writing is excellent and the story moves at a fast pace.  It keeps your attention throughout each episode by the interesting characters, shocking moments and suspense.  The special effects are also done well and are very realistic.

I recommend watching the extras on the DVD set-especially about the development of the series.  The plan was for three years.

I obviously enjoyed the series enough to purchase the complete series.

The basic concepts are somewhat geeky but if you can get behind the various Star Trek series and Outer Limits and One Step Beyond, you will probably enjoy this short-lived series. Even incorporates some concepts from Invasion of the Body Snatchers and a couple other movies.

Overall, I think the series was too geeky to appeal to the general public, but those with some interest in the higher math and sciences will especially enjoy the challenges presented to the FX/Computer-Generated Graphics people and their vision of how these theoreticals would appear visualized.

Stars some well known actors/actresses that you will recognize: Carla Gugino, Charles S. Dutton, Brent Spiner, and Peter Dinklage.

If you are not sure about wanting to purchase the series, it has been shown on the Sci-Fi channel, and after viewing a few episodes, you can make an informed decision. That is how I became reacquainted with the series and purchased after I returned from vacation.

Hope you enjoy....

2567075,3,B000FIHN8O,"Threshold was part of the rarest of all phenomenon: three new Sci-fi shows debuting at the same time on all three major networks. CBS had Threshold, ABC had Invasion, and NBC had Surface. Of the three, Threshold had the best pilot episode and the best cast in my opinion, but unfortunately it wasn't able to build upon the creepiness of the pilot and subsequently was the first of the three to be canceled.

The show starts out with an alien probe appearing at sea and emitting a strange signal that begins to effect the crew of a nearby ship, changing their DNA. Quickly Molly Caffrey (Carla Gugino), the author of the Threshold Protocol, an Alien Invasion contingency plan, is called into action. A team of brilliant minds (Brent Spiner, Rob Benedict, Peter Dinklage) is assembled and put at her disposal to deal with the Alien invasion.

The show was a meld of CSI, Men in Black and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. After the pilot the show basically followed the same formula: evidence of alien activity is discovered, the team goes out to investigate, the threat is neutralized, and the team creates a cover story to avoid a panic.

There was also an obvious underlying parallel between the alien invasion and the ""global war on terror"" and each episode seemed to make a point of forcing the viewer into the shoes of Caffrey and her team as they are forced to use extreme measures in the name of national security.

Overall it was good show that had a lot of potential and a great cast but it didn't generate the kind of ratings CBS wanted and so it was prematurely canceled.

2567077,5,B000FIHN8O,"Alien invasion by altering the DNA of the world's inhabitants. Wonderful concept! This series was too soon cancelled but the originators were thoughtful enough to give us a final episode that provides some closure.

The acting is well done and it was fun to see Brent Spiner in a role where he was not an artificial being (ST:TNG) or a doomed (mad?)scientist (Independence Day). Carla Gugino, Brian Van Holt and Rob Benedict were fine in their roles but I was pleasantly surprised to see Peter Dinklage in a role where he plays a substance abusing linguist/mathematician, and not a short person who has problems and evokes sympathy because of his height. Peter is excellant.

I did notice that this series has echoes of the X-Files but from what I saw in the 13 episodes it had a chance to be superior to the Duchovny vehicle. Or maybe I just got tired of the X-Files as it went on. The three scientists (Spiner, Dinklage, Benedict) were a darker, less humorous Lone Gunman.

Was it the best alien invasion tale? As someone who grew up on 1950's science-fiction movies and science-fiction paperbacks and the Science-Fiction Book Club, I would probably say no. Kevin McCarthy's Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the remake with Donald Sutherland are superior as is the TV series Invasion. But that is very good company to be around.

2567089,4,B000FIHN8O,"""Threshold"" is the adult alien invasion series for our time. It's not ""Earth Versus The Flying Saucers"", or ""The Blob"" or even ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". It doesn't rework old themes like ""Independence Day"" or ""War of the Worlds"".

""Threshold"" is ""The Invaders"" for our time. I think you have to go back to ""The Invaders"" to find a comparable serious television treatment of alien invasion. Although, like ""The Invaders"" the paranoia element is part of Threshold, unlike ""The Invaders"" or ""The X Files"" the grand conspiracy does not take centre stage. Unlike ""Star Gate Command"" in ""Star Gate"", or ""Star Fleet"" in ""Star Trek"", the secret defence agency in Threshold is neither squeakly clean or corrupted from above.

In a sense Threshold is as much a ""techno-thriller"" as sci.fi. In some ways it's the alien invasion story Tom Clancy would have written, if you could imagine Clancy writing something a little less Pentagon-centric than normal.

Threshold is inspired by the science of our time. The producers take a new track with new scientific elements inspired by newer scientific ideas drawn from chaos theory, fractal geometry, genetic engineering and ""hyper dimensions"". The ""science"" here of course is about as ""scientific"" as were the old sci-fi tales which somehow or other never found relativity a roadblock to extraterrestial invasion. But at least the producers deserve full points for trying something new.

Threshold is also inspired by the politics of our time. Armchair theorists are fond of describing ""The Thing"" (the original) and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original) as tales of the cold war and the McCarthyist era. I suspect the armchair theorists of the future will regard Threshold as a tale of 9-11 and the 'war on terror'. The secretive Threshold agency and it's staff pursue their war on the infected invaders whilst wrestling with civil liberties. Somehow or other it's the liberties that always manage to be violated but at least the Threshold chiefs acknowledge their violations. I suspect had the series persisted these theme and it's risks would have more thoroughly been examined.

Threshold is inspired by the society of our time. The lead player is a female consultant who is an effective and capable leader and entirely  feminine. Molly Caffrey is no Aliens 2 ""tougher than the guys"" Lt. Ripley.  She's closer to the original Lt Ripley from the original Alien. Someone whose heroism comes from doing her job properly, not one of these ""throw out the rule book"" Hollywood heroes.

The special effects for the series are excellent as are the personal characterisations. Working in something like Threshold would definitely strain any flesh and blood human being and the Threshold characters all have their personal isuues. And none of the characters is one dimensional either.

The boxed set is a well produced package with quality video transfers. The  extras include a brief documentary that acknowledges the unfortunate demise of the series and outlines some of the unfilled storylines the production crew were planning for future series that never came.

While I found it intriguing; the last was probably what doomed the series to be canceled. With so much going on in the world today that people believe our government is hiding from us, the viewers probably did not want to be reminded of the fact.

2567097,4,B000FIHN8O,"""Threshhold"" is the none-too-ironic name of a US Government top-secret contingency plan for a worst-case scenario of alien invasion.  When the series starts, alien forces - vast, cool, unsympathetic and largely unknown - send an ominous sign of their existence.  A mysterious floating object accompanied by a weird sound (the sound, interestingly enough, is the ""real"" signal) appears and causes all who experience it to undergo a genetic mutation.  Fortunately for us, the group who experiences this weird signal is initially restricted to a crew of merchantmen mid-Atlantic.  The Threshhold team - Gugino, Dinklage, Spiner and...two other guys (one a redundantly geeky scientist, the other a redundantly hunky SEAL) - board the ship and find that many of the crew died while enduring horrific mutations.  A few of the crew survived their bizarre metamorphoses, endowed with superhuman strength as well as a very certain consciousness of their alien purpose.  The team quickly theorizes that alien signal altered the crew's DNA (and maybe their own when they unwittingly expose themselves to a camcorder recording of the signal) as part of plan to colonize the Earth through us - by proxy.  While the signal was initially isolated in the Atlantic, some of the crew escape with the intention of spreading it and their new existence.  Thus Team Threshhold must race against time to learn the secret of the aliens' plan and contain their nascent infestation.

This was a promising show, frustrating and yet still unmissable - it's hard to say which side of the tightrope the series would have fallen towards had it been giving more of a chance.  In varying measures, every episode reflects both the pre- and post-Battlestar Galactica standard of primetime sci-fi.  On the one hand, ongoing plotlines are gritty and gripping, dripping with ominous riddles - fractal imagery, trees made of glass, that sort of stuff.  On the other hand, too much of ""Threshhold"" looks like the sort of cookie-cutter sci-fi of ""Star Trek: TNG"" - with the main characters comprising a team of aloof, brilliant, techno-babbling, high-powered operatives working out of a top-secret, high-tech fortress.  When the alien-altered crew finds its voice, they sound pretty much like the aliens on any of the episodes of the Berman/Braga ""Star Trek"" shows.  (They also reveal a plot-direction already used a decade ago on an ep. of ""Outer Limits"" that I will not reveal.  Suffice it to say that ""Threshhold"" channels enough Sci-Fi from ""Quatermass"" through ""The X-Files"".)  Though the show makes these fifth-columnists their principal target, the real horrors are those for whom the process didn't work out.  The real stars are ofcourse Dinklage and Spiner.  Not the heroes per se, they're easily the most human characters on the show and the best reason to catch it - disenchanted scientists dragooned into Gugino's crack alien-detecto squad.  With enough intel to end the menace, these two know enough about the seedier side of humanity to screen out the alien supermen.

Not all of the episodes are worth watching, but enough of them are - are arcing plot-lines require that you see everything.  The show never matures to consistently match the new wave of sci-fi like BSG or the similarly themed ""Torchwood"", but its mix of excellent and prosaic perfectly demonstrate how a sci-fi show can escape the bonds of the genre.",1170115200,2,3392,5.11978221415608

Anything positive comes from the actors on that front, who are all quite good, especially Brent Spiner.  Although the stories in themselves tend to be interesting, a lack of cleverness or wit in dialogue or presentation leaves the viewer rather bored. The average viewer who doesn't enjoy acting in itself, or the science (which ranges from good to groan) would not tune in more than once or twice.

2567117,5,B000FIHN8O,"Threshold was one of the most interesting new SF series to emerge in recent times.  It had an excellent premise; a mysterious catastrophe occurs which kills most of the crew on a naval ship.  Investigators gather some information including video shot of the event, which seems to show a strange multi-dimensional object spinning in space.  This object seems to have terrifying effects on the crew, killing some and changing others.

The government agency gathers up a group of outstanding scientists to figure out what happened, and stop the threat.  As the series progresses, it seems that the threat is an alien invasion which used the object to 'infect' the men with themselves by transmitting complicated information into their DNA helix.  Some of the survivors escape and mingle with the population, apparently with the goal of infecting the entire human race with the ultimate goal to re-create the Earth as a new home for the alien invaders.

The makers of the series cleverly exploit the fear of hidden threats in a post 9/11 world where threats can emerge from nowhere, and from people you never suspected.  The situation is made worse by the fact that the 'threats' are 'home-grown' and therefore impossible to detect and stop before they do damage.  In a way, the invasion is an updated allegory of the internal threats to our society, real or imagined, from the 'other' who is hidden in our midst yet a clear and present danger.

On the night that Threshold appeared on the Sci-Fi channel there was some bad weather so the satellite signal was mostly garbled.  But what I did see of the latter episodes shown that evening seemed really intriguing in spite having received a pixilated/gargled signal on the first episode &  of the second episode.  I was so intrigued that I went to Amazon.com and found that Threshold was sold as a DVD set which I went ahead and purchased because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next and I didn't want to risk missing any more of the story due to poor satellite reception.  I originally thought that Threshold was a mini series produced by the Sci-Fi channel but it wasn't until after I received the DVD set that I found out that it was a series that was canceled by CBS.

I started with the first episode and worked my way through the DVD set.  Before I was through I was shaking my head in disbelief and disgust that CBS would cancel a show that had a great story line, great actors & character development and a really good production quality.

The only part of the show that I found to be a turn-off was the non-lethal taser bullets that they fired from regular guns; other than that story and the science fiction was great.  The story was plausible and intelligent; it leads the mind but leaves plenty for the imagination and provokes questions.

If CBS was looking for something to compete with Lost or 24 this would have been an easy win for them.  It is gritty and has shadow conspiracies like the X-files but with the best intentions and moral statements that would rival any Star Trek episode.

2567122,5,B000FIHN8O,"Threshold starring Carla Gugino (Special guest Catherine Bell episode #11 Outbreak):

i loved this show. i liked it when it was on CBS and i like it even more now that i got the dvd's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion.

Carla Gugino was very good (as usual)playing a strong woman named Dr. Molley Anne Caffrey a contingency analayst who's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or man-made disaters. (earthquake,hurricanes, WWIII, epidemics, worldwide finacial depression) you get the picture. the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named ""Threshold"" (hence the name of the show). Threshold - is the contengency plan for alien invasion. her job is now to put the plan in motion. to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian, a mathmatican/linguist, an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the ""Red Team"". and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat.

the actors who played the other members on Molly's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all. but this review is about Carla and Catherine so i will get to the point.

Carla owned the show, she carried it off just like she did in ""Karen Sisco""

she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show. i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today. and she was just stunningly beautiful. every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her. the camera loved her. the beauty made you look her way. but the acting, the way she carried herself. made you stay focused on her.

Catherine Bell was on the episode ""Outbreak"" this episode was about about how Molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply. now they already knew this a few episodes before but, they thought they took care of it, but they were wrong. Molley needed to know exactly how they spread it, to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it. so she basically drafted Catherine Bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not.

Catherine Bell played Dr. Daphene Larsons. an expert on Botony and Biology. who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about. i'm afraid Catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest. i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member.

But Catherine - like Carla - was stunningly beautiful. however she does not have the same presence as Carla does when she on camera. she did a good job - but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to Carla when she was on. Carla was on her game and stayed on it. it was her show. Catherine did the best she could with what little she had, she was not on her game. but it wasn't her show.

Carla and Catherine had really no interaction together. the only one they kinda had was when Molly was briefing Daphene on Threshold and the story thus far. and that was done with Daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and over-whelmed while Molly stood in front of her and explained it all. and it was all done using cross fade and fade in-outs edits. i appreciated the effects - nice touch - but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there. i'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i don't know; kick some alien butt together or Kissed.

in conclusion - i loved the show. then tension kept me going and seemed real.

it wasn't neardy and though it was ScFi, i really didn't get that feeling. there was more to the story, it was intellegently done and i wanted more. but they cancelled it. the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you don't feel too cheated buying one season of the show. it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more, but, could still come up with your own conclusions. they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do. then i guess it is still okay.

the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to Molly's scernario:

1. Threshold - we have spotted and accessed the threat.

2. Foothold - they have established themselves on earth. we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary. (Probably what season 2 would have been called.

3. Stranglehold - if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us. (Season three title i suppose.)

2567123,4,B000FIHN8O,"CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's ""SURFACE"" and ABC's ""INVASION"", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.

Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb?  Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's ""reality"" shows and less than funny comedies.

Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting?  Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters.  Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job.

Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes?  Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios.

So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated?  Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law & Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).

Is it worth buying or renting? Yes.  Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it's one season wonders don't have--an adequate conclusion that doesn't leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved.",1162425600,2,1697,5.22140221402214

I have a feeling that the production costs were higher than you might expect from looking at it, that and a nervous/ignorant network probably didn't help matters any. One of the extras bits has the producers telling the ideas they had for continuing both the first season and subsequent seasons- there were some potentially very good stories being thought of.

CBS/Paramount didn't go to a lot of extra effort on the DVD set, the packaging is nice but you get only one commentary and deleted scenes offering (on the pilot)3 extra featurettes (the one on fractals appears to have an easter egg with a bit more information)and of course the four unaired episodes. There's also no scene selection function and no subtitling.

One feature that the deaf/hard of hearing may appreciate is that everything is close captioned, including all of the extras. If you have trouble hearing this can be a big help since most DVD productions don't subtitle extras (this one doesn't subtitle anything at all)and I think this is the first I've ever seen to caption more than just the episodes.",1160956800,3,1650,4.802816901408451

2567129,4,B000FIHN8O,"Too bad that this show was cut down in its prime by short-sighted and bottom-line oriented TV executives, and neglected by unimaginative TV viewers.  I enjoyed it even more on DVD, and really dug the unaired episodes, especially the final one, ""Alienville.""  This was a program that was adeptly cast, with very good acting, interestingly told (well written), and even decent SFX on a TV budget and schedule. The extra features on disc 4 were pretty cool too, especially the one that covered future plot developments had the show continued.  With a noticeable scarcity of good sci fi on TV these days (Stars Trek and Gate both gone or going, etc.), it hurts even more that Threshold was never given the chance it deserved.",1158105600,24,721,4.798387096774194
2567130,4,B000FIHN8O,"Threshold had the advantages of a great cast and what looks to be a good sized budget, but it was still canceled after less than half a season. While watching this dvd set, your reaction will alternate between ""How could this have been cancelled?!?"" and ""Why wasn't this cancelled sooner?!?""

The cast has good chemistry, especially the supporting characters, the plot is basically a remake of the movie Sphere, but better, and in certain episodes everything really comes together and its a great show and you don't want the episode to end

BUT, other episodes are completely directionless, at times you can't understand what's going on or why they're bothering to do something that seems pointless, simple simple errors are all over the place, like the ""special forces"" soldiers making simple errors like turning their backs on people they're guarding constantly, really annoying stuff. If you know anything at all about physical fighting or clearing a room or any of that, you will be annoyed that they couldn't be bothered to hire a consultant who knows anything about that, but that's true of most programs on tv these days

Not to mention that the actual star of the show (Carla Gugino) is easily the worst actor involved with the project. She only has two ""tools"": the sassy walk and the ""duh? what?"" blank stare. She wears both of those out by the 5th or 6th episode. Some of the extras are laughably bad, but if Gugino was ok it wouldn't stand out as much

Then you have the problems with plot points that are raised but never dealt with; I have to give them a pass on that since the show WAS cancelled mid-season, but when you watch the set it will annoy you to have something really interesting come up, not be mentioned again for 4 episodes, and then have the series just kind of peter out

Over all, I'd give it 3.5 or 4 stars. When its good, its really good, so I'm not sorry I watched it. But by the time its over you won't wonder why it got cancelled, which is kind of a shame because with a little more effort I think it could have been an outstanding show.",1157932800,11,2073,4.532085561497326
2567131,5,B000FIHN8O,"Once again a largely original series that is not dumbed down or derivative, and has some cool ideas and terrific future potential, is cancelled whilst lesser series march on.  I would go so far as to say that, by current standards, if the ""X-Files"" had made it's appearance now rather than 13 years ago, it too would have been cancelled in the middle of it's first season.

""Threshold"" in my opinion had the most potential of the three 'alien invasion' shows that aired last season (""Invasion"" and ""Surface"" nevertheless were not far behind, with ""Surface"" being the most enjoyable and exciting) and the show planned to evolve over three seasons as the story progressed from ""Threshold"" to ""Foothold"" and finally ""Stranglehold"", signifying the the level of alien presence.  This would, indeed, have been unique on American television and the potential for each season would have been just tremendous and may have changed the genre for good.  Imagine the core ""Threshold"" team either changing or being added to as the needs of defence from the invasion increased with each season.  Imagine the story expanding to global proportions as the series moved from a localised incident to full scale global invasion.

As the special features reveal, the story of ""Threshold"" is rooted in realism and science today and the fantastic elements were not too far removed from what is possible.  It taps into the fear and paranoia that 9/11 unleased and takes it to another level.

Perhaps one day the producers of this fine show could finish the the present ""Threshold"" story and show the ""Foothold"" and ""Stranglehold"" stories as two separate mini-series of, say, six hours each.  This may not be good as the three season plan, but would at least allow audiences to see the complete story, and may also be a blessing in disguise in that the show could really go to town with the pace, suspense and scares as well as the special effects over a pre-determined number of episodes.  However, in the interim, enjoy ""Threshold"" for what it is now and imagine the rest...",1157500800,15,2050,4.881844380403458
2567132,4,B000FIHN8O,"Of the three network alien invasion shows that debuted in the fall of 2005, ""Threshold was my favorite.  That would explain why they only got nine of the fourteen episodes they filmed on the air, along with the fact the series was on CBS, which tends to cut bait earlier than its competitors these days.  Fortunately when ""Threshold,"" like ""Surface"" and ""Invasion,"" came out as a DVD of ""The Complete Series,"" fans finally get to see the episodes that never aired and to reconsider the strengths and weaknesses of this series created by Bragi F. Schut.

When a mysterious alien object attacks the USS ""Big Horn"" and its crew in the North Atlantic, the U.S. government protocols for project Threshold go into affect.  Dr. Molly Anne Caffrey (Carla Gugino), the contingency analyst who wrote the protocols, becomes the head of the project.  She puts together her Red Team, consisting of Dr. Nigel Fenway (Brent Spienr), a molecular biologist, Lucas Pegg (Robert Patrick Benedict), an astronautical engineer, and Arthur Ramsey (Peter Dinklage), an expert in linguistics and applied mathematics.  Overseeing the group is J.T. Baylock (Charles S. Dutton), the assistant National Security Advisor, and the muscle of the team is Sean Cavennaugh (Brian Van Holt), a special agent.  The team investigates what happened on the ship and learn that the alien probe sent out signals that has altered the DNA of the crew into a triple helix formation, a fractal triskelion-like pattern that will keep appearing throughout the series in blood, electronic signals, city lights, and ordinary household objects that get spilled on the floor.

Originally the top item on the Threshold agenda is to track down the missing crew members, but then the major concern becomes stopping the aliens from infecting more humans.  So there was much more of an episodic nature to ""Threshold"" than its two competitors, which is one of the reasons I liked this show best.  There is a sense in which the show was ""The X-Files"" if the government totally supported Fox Muldar, but a key dynamic is that trying to deal with the alien invasion is a ""think tank,"" so that science is a key part of the problem solving.  What makes the Red Team unusual is that they were basically drafted by Caffrey and as the series progressed each member developed problems that put them at risk.  By the time the series ended the problems of Pegg had taken center stage, replacing those of Fenway early on, but those of Ramsey were clearly moving to the forefront.  This show had a pretty good cast, especially getting Gugino to stay in television after ""Karen Sisco"" undeservedly crashed and burned, but having Dutton, Spiner and Dinklage in supporting roles was a real casting coup (getting one of those three would be great news for a series).

This is not to say that the show was not without its flaws.  Molly suffers from Captain Kirk Syndrome, which is the insistence on putting herself in harm's way each week.  That is bad enough when you are a Starfleet captain, but considerably worse when she is ""the most important person on the planet.""  Caffrey and Cavennaugh make a nice team out there in the field, but she is the director of Threshold and should not be out there.  There was an attempt to fix this in ""Outbreak,"" one of the unaired episodes, by bringing on Catherine Bell as Daphne Larson, but that was too little, too late.  Then there was the fact that an alien invasion as begun and Caffrey keeps going home.  Not only do bad things happen there, which is one reason to stop going there, but once again the project director is someplace other than in the bunker doing her job.  Having come up with a nice twist on the death of the National Security Advisor, the show then comes up with a new NSA, Ed Whitaker (Maurice Godin), who is your traditional politician who thinks they know everything and is going to get everybody killed with his arrogant stupidity.  But then he disappears too, only without any explanation.  So there are enough significant problems that I round down on this one.

So what you will see in the unaired (at least on this side of the pond) episodes are some attempts at retooling the show that did not go anywhere and did not stop ""Threshold"" from being cancelled. The special features on the DVD do a bit of a post-mortem on the series, which got off to something of a wrong foot when CBS at essentially the last minute decided they wanted to start the series off as a two-hour movie.  So the great ending they came up with for ""Trees Made of Glass"" then became the fade out to the station break in the middle.  The show was cancelled while filming the final episode, ""Alienville,"" and the creators had time to work in one brief scene involving a dream where Molly is told that her protocols will work, but that she will not live to see victory.  The creators also talk about what they were planning to do, both in terms of a specific episode for Ramsey and the initial three-year plan that would basically transform the series from ""Threshold"" to ""Foothold"" in season two and ""Stranglehold"" in season three.  Clearly things would get worse before Molly dies and things get better (I read elsewhere that Dr. Fenway was going to end up in charge, just to make things really interesting).",1157155200,10,5277,4.7251908396946565
2567133,5,B000FIHN8O,"I remember being disappointed when this show didn't continue. First let me say while everyone has an opinion, this show was far better than Invasion ( slow ), and shouldn't even be mentioned with Surface ( terrible because of the kid/ baby monster ). The pilot ( 1st two episodes ) throws everything at you. It's one of the best, and is a must watch. It's so good that it was hard to match each week. Poor acting, far from it, top notch. Poor writing. After watching the series there really isn't a filler episode that so many shows ( for example Babylon 5 which is a favorite ) has. I wonder what a second season would have had since the show would have had to take it up a level in story. I will say this. When Miracles; the series was released, I gave it a 5 stars and super praise review just for the memories of the few episodes I'd watched. After watching the dvd set I was truly let down. None of the episodes I'd missed really added more to the story. In fact the story was put on hold, and the ending was a total let down. This series on the other hand just makes you want more. Is it original? Well, more than not. Look for Catherine Bell during the last unaired episodes.  Recommended.",1157155200,8,1196,4.222707423580786
2567134,4,B000FIHN8O,This was an excellent series which seemed to be based on a similar premise to Wyndham's the Kraken wakes.  At last a decent TV translation of a Wyndham idea.

2567146,5,B000FIHN8O,"""Threshold"" reminded me of something Norm from Cheers said in an episode; ""It's a dog-eat-dog world and I'm wearing Milkbone underwear"". The networks put Milkbone underwear on a lot of their TV shows metaphorically speaking and if they can't get a large audience they get thrown to the dogs. CBS cancelled the show far too soon as the show only aired 8 of its 12 episodes (the pilot was a double length episode). The good news for fans is that when the producers found out the show was being cancelled they were in the middle of shooting the last episode (""Alienville"")and this allowed them to rewrite the ending to provide a conclusion (of sorts)to the series.

**Caution some minor spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the show*** Skip the next three short paragraphs.

For those that haven't seen the show the premise is very powerful allowing for suspense and very effective; an alien probe with 4 or 5 dimensional properties shows up. It's signal effects the crew altering their DNA from our normal double helix rewriting the DNA of the crew into a triple helix. It's an alien invasion done by making US the aliens.

Dr. Molly Caffrey (Carla Gugino best known from ""Spy Kids"" and ""Sin City"")created a protocol for first contact including hostile first contact. She assembles a team of top notch scientists in their field including Dr. Nigel Fenwya (Brent Spiner of ""Star Trek:The Next Generation""); Lucas Pegg (Robert Patrick Benedict from ""Felicity"") a brilliant physicists and designer for NASA; Arthur Ramsey (Peter Dinklage ""Elf"" and from the film ""Find Me Guilty"")a brilliant mathematician and linguist and covert ops agent Sean Vavennaugh (Brian Van Holt from ""S.W.A.T."" and ""Black Hawk Down""). They form the basis with Assistant Secretary of Defense J.T. Baylock (Charles S. Dutton)of ""Red Team"" whose job is to identify the threat, find out the aliens agenda and neutralize them.

The USS Big Horn's crew is infected with many of them dying while others develop superhuman strength, rapid healing abilities and all share a dream of the alien world and race that wants to ""Bioform"" humanity and terraform our planet for their own purposes. Suddenly Red Team has an outbreak on their hands and they must capture the sailors before they can infect others. The fact that the sailors choose multiple paths of infection make their job that much more difficult. When various members of their team accidently experience some level of infection it gives them a link to the aliens but also could potential pose a danger to the team.

**End of potential spoilers***

Well written, with top notch acting, writing and direction the show may have suffered from an inconsistent tone as the show was looking to establish its identity but towards the end of the run the show truly did find its voice. Unfortunately the best episodes of the series (the last four) never aired at all and fans of the series are in for a real treat. It's a pity this show wasn't given a chance (the producers had a three year story arc planned out)but what we do get provides for a marvelous and entertaining ""mini-series"".

The DVD comes with some very nice extras for such a short lived series. We get a four part documentary on the making of the show from the origin of the concept, through casting, the planned story arc and other elements. We also get a good featurette on the visual effects of the show. There's also an Easter Egg. Finally we get a very good featurette with science advisor/producer/writer Andre Bormanis (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") discussing the fractal geometry of the alien ""message"" that coverted people over and its real scientifici basis. He also discusses real efforts to work on adding a third strand of DNA to the double-helix in labs to modify food, etc. We also get a commentary track on the pilot by producer/director/writer David Goyer (""Blade"")and Brannon Braga (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Enterprise""). The fact that the show was able to attract some top notch film directors/TV directors (Peter Hyams, Bill L. Norton, David S. Goyer among others) and writers is a pretty good sign of the high quality of the show.

An excellent series ""Threshold"" was the best of the science fiction shows that appeared in 2005 and one of the best (by its end) of the new crop of shows on the air. It's a pity it was cut short. The show is spread out over four discs and housed in individual slimline cases with two discs in each set.

She is suppose to be this genius that is the best in the world at crisis management. I find it hard to believe she could even manage a seven eleven much less this job. If they had done better casting and better writing this might have taken off.

""Threshold"" has been welcomed to that club of single season great shows that was cancelled, well not after only 8 episodes at least. Now what is unbelievable is that ""Surface"" and ""Invasion"", which in my humble opinion, were good but slightly inferior and yet managed not to get cancelled at least till the end of the season. I suppose I shouldn't put to much blame on those series as none of them survived. I guess 2005 will be remembered for the year of the SciFi series that all died. What part of studio executives are total idiots do you think they don't get? They don't get it if there is enough interest for this to sell on DVD, there certainly is an audience. Actually selling this as a complete series is a bit of an overstatement as most complete seasons are around 20 plus episodes. But that said I still want it. In fact I hope this DVD sells like crazy to show the studio they need to fire idiots that cancel good shows. Along with a couple of Bruce Campbell series ""Brisco County Jr."" and ""Jack of All Trades"" that only lasted a season I was happy to see this one come out on DVD. Now if they just put ""Veritas"" and ""Roar"" on DVD I will be very happy. The most annoying thing about what happened to Threshold is it wasn't even given a good chance. Everytime I tried to watch it it seemed to get pre-empted by something else. After all they only televised eight episodes so we get four episodes that we haven't even seen yet.

Of the three ""Threshhold was the best.  A very good cast of believable complex and interesting characters and strong story lines.  I was sooooo annoyed when they cancelled it but I saw it coming.  Science fiction shows just don't fly on the networks with their ratings drama and preemptions for specials, which add insult to injury.

Brent Spiner as the curmudgeonly genius doctor was great--part Star Trek 'Bones' part Dr. House.  Carla Gugino (she does not have the luck of the Irish--she got axed a couplel of seasons back from her own show on ABC--a good show!)gets to be female and kick butt, what more could you ask for.
