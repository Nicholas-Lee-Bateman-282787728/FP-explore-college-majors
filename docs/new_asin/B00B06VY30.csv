8560185,5,B00B06VY30,"One of the up and coming young comics in Los Angeles, Brock Wilbur brings it all to his first comedy special, ""28 Years Later""--- filmed on his 28th birthday. An acclaimed screenwriter, author, and actor, Brock is one of those fresh, thought provoking comics to keep an eye on in the years ahead. The host of numerous comedy shows including Death of the Weekend, Tell and Show, and last year's host at the comedy stage of the LA Fringe Festival, Brock's special will make you laugh, and might even engage you into looking at life a little differently.",1374451200,,551,4.63265306122449
8560186,5,B00B06VY30,"Brock Wilbur brings a very unique brand of caustically hilarious, self-deprecating humor to the stage in an impressive film debut after only a year of professional stand-up comedy. His wit is rooted in a hyper-intelligent, visionary world-view uncommon of someone his age and experience in the comedy world. If this is his first (very well-produced) foray into filmed specials, I really look forward to seeing what comes next from this affable, giant jokester :)",1358121600,,462,5.256756756756757
