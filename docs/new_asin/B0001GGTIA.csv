8553026,1,B0001GGTIA,The sound doesnt line up with the movie. Its delayed by one to two seconds. I don't mind a bootleg but this is just awful.,1524873600,,122,3.92
8553027,2,B0001GGTIA,Slow but cool old cinema.,1520208000,,25,4.2
8553028,1,B0001GGTIA,The audio was off from the video by a good 2-3 seconds.  Made it unwatchable.,1477872000,,77,4.133333333333334
8553029,3,B0001GGTIA,"The DVD quality here is complete rubbish but it fits the movie well. One of the last productions of British weirdo Derek Ford. He was part Roger Corman and part underground pornographer. He was basically a character from one of his own films and even at the end of his life he was beating his own drum with this film.

Blood Tracks involves a Motley Crew type band who show up at a ski resort to sorta work but mostly to have a drug and sex fueled weekend. Little do they know that there's a Hills Have Eyes situation a foot and those little known Swiss Deliverance types are gonna try and rape and eat them, which people have sex with their food in films like this.

I'm making it sound more lurid than it is. It's basically a Friday the 13th type movie with a clan of cannibals. It's also hard to see the lurid stuff cause this DVD transfer is pretty bad. It's still fun on a primal level. Lots of silly moments of having sex before a snow avalanche and being more worried about running out of drugs than air. Lots of searching for people in your underwear. Oh and of course fighting cannibals. Not bad if you know what you're getting into",1464134400,,1141,4.277777777777778
8553030,1,B0001GGTIA,"Amazingly entertaining 80's snowbound slasher Swedish sensations film rendered all but unwatchable by a lousy transfer from vhs, dark and grainy, with the audio lagging behind the image.  Oh yeah, it's a dvd-r, too.  The listing fails to mention this tidbit.  Hopefully someday someone will issue a decent print of this so-bad-it's-good slice of Swedish insanity.",1442793600,3,363,5.446428571428571
8553031,2,B0001GGTIA,"BLOOD TRACKS (aka: HEAVY METAL) opens in 1945, w/ a violent, family confrontation resulting in death. Forty years later, a metal band is in ""town"" -more like a wasteland- to film a music video. The band (EASY ACTION) sounds / looks like any one of the multitudinous, generic QUIET RIOT / POISON-esque, hair-bands of the era. Of course, the band's not alone, and things soon take a terrifying turn, as the family from the beginning shows up, looking pretty much the same, except for bad make-up and mangy wigs. Enter the super-models, running around half dressed in the snow! Not even their towering hair-dos can save them! The filming of the music video itself is hilarious, and will have you pining for the days of spandex and MTV goofiness! Once the blood-letting kicks into gear, the absurdity explodes! Will EASY ACTION be able to finish their video, or will they be annihilated instead? The future of all music may be at stake! BLOOD TRACKS is sort of an imbecilic version of THE SHINING merged w/ RAW MEAT -not really- for those who demand heaping helpings of limburger in their 80s epics. Unfortunately, when people aren't busy dying, the movie bogs down in tedious non-dialogue and ""acting"". It needed a lot more murder, far more frequently. Even the avalanche is dull! Ugh...",1407628800,,1284,4.8144796380090495
8553032,5,B0001GGTIA,"This Film is by far the best I have seen when it Comes To ""Spooky Weirdos""  Who eat human flesh as a way to survive.  the Film Is amazingly heart pounding from the beginning  till the end.  If you don't buy this film then you are truely missing out on one thriller ride of action packed chills.  Its especially sweet in the end when the Guy gets the girl.  How About that?  Even after he just had to fight his way through a gang of sabretooth ""Philistine"" Apocalyptic freaks who can't speak.",1135814400,4,491,4.271739130434782
