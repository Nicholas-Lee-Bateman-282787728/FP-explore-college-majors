8645563,1,B00IUSP72U,"First of all, this is the 1930 sound version of Peacock Alley - not the 1922 ""Lost Silent Classic"" the cover would have you believe it to be (interestingly, the disc I received has the same cover, but the line ""Lost Silent Classics Collection"" has been removed - although it still says it on the disc menu!).  Second, the transfer is horrible - even for Alpha Video.; both video and audio are only fair at best - and I am quite generous when rating the quality of rare films, so when I say it's fair, most people would find it unwatchable.  So, okay, it's the 1930 version - at least you get to see/hear Ms. Murray's musical numbers, right?  WRONG!  Ms. Murray's musical numbers have been cut - which not only interrupts the narrative of the story, but leaves only a bland, predictable (and really rather sad) early talkie behind.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  Alpha Video needs to get a conscience about taking people's money for some of the dross they release.",1442102400,10,959,4.546511627906977
