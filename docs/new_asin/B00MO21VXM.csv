8673378,4,B00MO21VXM,"A fun nostalgic adventure to a simpler and kinder time.  Overall the transfer quality is satisfactory but not ideal in several places.  I suppose the publishers don't think a sitcom of this period deserves a digital transfer which is too bad, because it is a classic of the period.",1463616000,,281,4.714285714285714
8673379,4,B00MO21VXM,"MY FAVORITE MARTIAN: As the predecessor to ""alien invasion"" programs like MORK & MINDY and ALF, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN concerned a highly intelligent extraterrestrial underplayed to perfection by RAY WALSTON, whose crashed spaceship was discovered by newspaper reporter TIM O'HARA (the always reliable BILL BIXBY). Passed off as ""Uncle Martin"" after taking up residency in O'HARA's apartment over a garage which housed the damaged rocket, Martin swore Tim to secrecy, hipping his alternately fascinated/exasperated student to advanced Martian customs. Martin's powers included mind reading, critter communication, levitating objects (always accompanied by eerie Theremin sound effects) and materializing/dematerializing by utlizing a small antennae hidden in the back of his head. Blonde, bubbly Pamela Britton as their delightfully scatter-brained, nosey landlady and the usual array of character actors from Vitto Scotti to Madge Blake helped propel this cornucopia of sci-fi hijinks for three seasons. Although spun off into a long forgotten Saturday morning cartoon and a best forgotten DISNEY reboot, nothing could compare to the original...for smart, well crafted comedy, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN was light years ahead of its time.

8673380,5,B00MO21VXM,"Nice sampler of episodes spanning all three seasons of one of the earliest supernatural situation comedy series of the 1960s.
Bill Bixby was a fine comedic actor and Ray Walston was superb. This is a good overview and introduction.",1430352000,3,231,4.948717948717949
