The slow, medium, fast concept is really good, however hip hop is not her genre.  It really makes her look old and like she is trying to be 20 and really hip.  I just could not buy into the video.  Although you are dancing somewhat it doesn't give you the real workout you are probably looking for from a real certified fitness instructor.  You feel like you are getting a work out from an untrained celebrity.  I have actually been really disappointed in all the dance videos except for Denise Austin's.  Hers are dancing yet they stay on the path of workout type exercising if that makes sense.  Although the dancing with the stars dancers are trained dancers they are not certified fitness instructors and you can tell in that series of videos as well.  Certified instructors are going to do moves that have scientific research as being affective as well as moves that shouldn't cause the kinds of injuries you can have by just doing what these people are doing on your tv/dvd player.  I also realized after renting a few of these dance videos we all have types of exercising we like and will be successful at.  My best friend and I are so different in our desires, she likes the boot camp type exercising and I am a relaxed at my pace treadmill walker. So after looking at my exercise DVD's the ones that I am most happy with is TamiLee Webb and Denise Austin.  Find what you like for you and don't base it totally on a bad or good review.",1261180800,,1606,4.367003367003367
8350863,1,B0024O9LPU,"I really wanted to enjoy this workout DVD, as I am a big fan of Hip Hop and Ballroom DVDs, so I thought putting them together would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is that none of her cuing is in reverse, which is an industry standard. Normally, in a dance DVD, the instructor will tell you to move to the left while moving to her right. So, you will move to your left as instructed and ""mirror"" the instructor. Unfortunately, Lisa doesn't do this. It makes it really difficult to follow. If you follow her voice cues, you won't be following the TV. Unfortunately, it just makes for a very frustrating experience and I wasn't able to finish the workout.",1258243200,6,673,4.435483870967742
8350864,1,B0024O9LPU,"This workout DVD is AWFUL if you have even the vaguest notion of how to move to a beat.  The dance moves are ok (I guess, I couldn't stnd to make it through the entire DVD), but there is no real music behind the workout, and the even the pathetic bit of beat that's provided in NOT IN SYNC WITH THE DANCERS!  It was incredibly frustrating - just about get the moves down at slower speed, trying to move with both the instructor AND the music, but you and she (along with here backup group) are obviously moving to a different drummer. The moves and the music (if you call it that) are half a beat out of.  Just frustrating to no end.",1257206400,6,633,4.130081300813008
