1847804,4,B00008H2GI,"While Bulldog Drummond dates all the way back to the silent era of film, the most fun to be had was surely the ""B"" series which came later. This terrific entry in the Bulldog Drummond ""B"" series, featuring John Howard in the role of Hugh Drummond, moves quickly and has more atmosphere than usual. Reginald Denny and E.E. Clive return as Bulldog's pals but Heather Angel is missed as his soon-to-be bride. Louise Campbell does a nice job as Phyllis, however, and John Barrymore's presence as the Colonel adds a serious touch to the proceedings.

Phyllis is kidnapped from Rockingham by two seriously twisted criminal minds Colonel Nielson has been aware of for some time. J. Carroll Naish and Helen Freeman are fun as the evil Valdein and Irena. Nielson allows Bulldog to search for Phyllis in his own way by following the deliberate clues left him, such as phonograph records, to find his lady love.

But while Bulldog and his pals go down to the docks in a merry yet somber chase, the Colonel isn't far behind. Barrymore gets to don disguises so he can follow the action without being seen. Howard, sometimes accused of being a bit bland as Drummond by some, seems a bit more dashing here opposite the Great Profile.

It is Tenny (E.E. Clive) who comes to the rescue in this one in Edward T. Lowe's screenplay based on ""Bulldog Drummond and the Female of the Species"" by H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile. Louis King directs this entry in the series with some flair and the ending is a real bang! Bulldog may have a clear path to the alter finally but for a last second breeze!

A very good entry despite the absence of Heather Angel, and one fans of Bulldog Drummond don't want to miss.",1270166400,,1677,4.58
1847805,2,B00008H2GI,"This is a little second feature from 1937, a low-budget detective story that contains the odd pleasure of seeing John Barrymore in one of his last films.  The story, taken from a novel, is fairly entertaining, and the acting is competent.  However, the print is terrible, and the sound is not much better.  There is no excuse for selling any film in such poor condition.",1130284800,6,370,4.661538461538462

7984330,4,B00008H2GI,"John Barrymore's presence and performance elevates this film far above what it would be without him.  Plot focuses on Bulldog Drummond's forth-
coming marriage and self-doubts.  Additionally, kidnappings occur and villains try their best to revenge earlier plights ast upon them by Drummond's apprehensions.  Barrymore supposedly had great fun playing a variety of characters in disguise throughout the film.  Alright plot and performances
but John Barrymore is the real interest here.",1426204800,,485,5.788732394366197
7984331,5,B00008H2GI,I like all of the Bulldog Drummond movies and this is another great one. It has an A movie plot and the acting is as good as any A movie you will see. If they had only made these B movies a little longer. Add 10 minutes and you would have an A movie. Great DVD.,1410134400,,261,3.6785714285714284

7984333,2,B00008H2GI,"It looks like Bulldog (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket.

Only this time the movie stats out with Phyllis' kidnapping. From there is Bulldog formula.

The copy I watched is an Alpha Video poor quality 1937 version at 58 minutes.  The screenplay based on ""Bulldog Drummond and the Female of the Species"" by H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile.

7984334,3,B00008H2GI,"<strong>Bulldog Drummond Comes Back</strong> (Louis King, 1937)

I can't find any evidence whatsoever that I reviewed <em>Bulldog Drummond Comes Back</em>, the first of seven Bulldog Drummond films featuring John Hammond in the title role, anywhere, though I know I must have; I distinctly remember writing the line ""sensibly, Hammond jumped ship to accept a role in <em>The Philadelphia Story</em>"". But I can't find the review anywhere, so I'll write another one. Oddly, Hammond's seven-film stretch as Drummond was not a reign. Hammond played Bulldog Drummond seven times between 1937 and 1939, but was not the only actor to do so during that period; both John Lodge (in <em>Bulldog Drummond at Bay</em>) and Ray Milland (in <em>Bulldog Drummond Escapes</em>) took turns as the pulp-fiction private eye. (If Milland's name causes raised eyebrows, Walter Pidgeon also took on the role for <em>Calling Bulldog Drummond</em> in 1951.) much of the modern criticism of the film seems to stem from the casting of Hammond, but given that he stuck around for six more movies, someone must have thought he was okay in the role. I didn't mind him all that much, truth be told; there are far more problems with the script and the budget here than there are with Hammond.

Plot: Bulldog Drummond is about to get hitched? Say it ain't so! But yes, everyone's favorite cross between Nick Charles and Nick Carter (the spy, not the singer) is poised to wed Phyllis Clavering (Louise Campbell, whose three Drummond film appearances are by far the most prominent in her fourteen-film career). Until, that is, she's kidnapped by a bunch of durned furriners. (The Bulldog Drummond books are notable for their racism; the movies didn't do much to cover that up.) And thus, Drummond and his longtime pal Colonel Neilson (John Barrymore, slumming it) are off to rescue the damsel in distress from the durned furriners.

It's a pretty darned good cast (I failed to mention Reginald Denny as a tagalong--think Constantine's cab-driver pal, here, whose name currently escapes me--and the incomparable E. E. Clive as Tenney, Drummond's butler, who does what all good butlers should: play the straight man), and they do the best with what they're given. Problem is, what they're given isn't much. Writer Edward T. Lowe and director Louis King were both silent-film hacks who came up the hard way, Lowe in mysteries and King in potboiler westerns of the Lone Star variety. (Oddly, both are best remembered for their work in the Charlie Chan series today, King for <em>Charlie Chan in Egypt</em> and Lowe for <em>Charlie Chan at the Racetrack</em>, but at no point in the franchise did the two cross paths.) While the crossing of those two genres, however ghostly it may be, in a pulp action film does lend it a certain air one doesn't really expect to find in a pulp action film, there's not nearly enough of that atmosphere to make it distinctive enough to do even the slightest patch job over the plot holes and other silliness. Still, if you're in the mood for a turn-your-brain-off action picture and Schwarzenegger never did it for you, the Bulldog Drummond films are only slightly politically incorrect (compared to the books, anyway), have a good amount of witty patter, and are only about an hour long apiece; you could do better, but you could do a lot worse. ** ",1310947200,,3346,4.948398576512456
7984335,2,B00008H2GI,"Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, 1937 film

The story begins with Hugh Drummond typing on a foggy day. Does ""harried"" rhyme with ""married""? Algy found tacks on the road and all his tires went flat. A stranger gave him a ride to Drummond's house. Mikhail Valdin has a score to settle, and gives orders to Drummond. Phyllis was kidnapped! Clues are left behind for Hugh to follow. Hugh then is given another clue. A disguised Colonel Neilson follows him. [Wouldn't a big false nose attract attention?] Hugh, Algy, and Tenny search Limehouse for the next clue. A fight in that bar for distraction. Should Hugh trust a stranger?

Is there a secret in that message? Another gramophone record, round and flat. There is another meeting with Valdin on the road. The heroes continue in pursuit. After a while they are trapped in a room. A ticking sound suggests an infernal machine. Colonel Neilson and the police from Scotland Yard follow them, then Valdin when the villains leave. Shots are fired to stop Valdin's automobile. Tenny shows up to free them from the locked room. So all ends well.

This is another drama with comedy. It seems like a low-budget production, like some other but better dramas of that era. Note the dark backgrounds (film noir).",1289001600,,1243,4.799065420560748
