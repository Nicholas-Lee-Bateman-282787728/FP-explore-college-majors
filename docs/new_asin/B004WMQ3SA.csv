It shows people from disparate backgrounds and considerably different ages all of whom are unified in their love of skateboarding, partying and personal freedom.

Yes, this movie shows a filthy, depraved underbelly and many/most might not choose to live this way but this is EXACTLY what a great documentary should do - expose us to worlds unseen.

I'm super impressed with what has been captured here and it makes me want to venture out and see and experience this firsthand with my own two eyes.",1422057600,,640,4.916666666666667
8445352,1,B004WMQ3SA,"That this film has won a number of film festival awards only suggests that, as a documentary of a strange and disturbing youth cult, it is well done.

But what it portrays - a violent cult leader and his perverse following - illustrates everything that's wrong with today's ""youth"" (I put that in quotation marks because the leader is an adolescent of 40) culture.",1416096000,,364,4.6875
