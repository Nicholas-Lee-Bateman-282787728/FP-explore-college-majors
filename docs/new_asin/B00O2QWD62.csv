6708048,1,B00O2QWD62,"With the ""History"" channel logo, I expected at least some attempt at historical themes and accuracy, and avoidance of blood-soaked violence.  I was disappointed on all counts.

There are three sections which cover the Biblical tales about Moses, Joshua, and the Exodus, which is where my complaints are focused.  Also two additional presentations narrated by Leonard Nimoy, of old Star Trek fame, are included.  One is on ""The Secret Life of King Ramses II"" and the other, on the ""Ark of the Covenant"".  Both of those last items are excellent science-based investigations, and also available elsewhere as VHS or DVD (by A&E), so my one-star review is aimed only at the three Biblical items, which are so bad it overshadows what good is in the Nimoy presentations. I would highly recommend those other two, but get them separately, or at least know what you are getting if you buy the full set here.

Firstly, authentic historians will note that the characters in the Old Testament, such as Moses or Joshua, are completely undocumented from any archaeological or ancient-historical records from the times when they supposedly lived, or when the Old Testament is supposed to have been written.  The Bible chapters have no surviving copies that date back before c. 300 AD, and nearly none of it has archaeological supports in terms of the people and events, recounted outside of the Old Testament Bible or Torah.  Factually, those ancient tales or events are so generic they could easily reference many different things, even while some of the place-names are identifiable.  But archaeological ruins from ancient Egypt or modern Israel and Jordan do not confirm any of it in an unambiguous manner.

So just what is being discussed on the DVDs?  I expected some Bible sympathy, certainly, where the characters of Moses and his followers could be sympathetically and critically reviewed against known Egyptian archaeology, and later events in Sinai and Palestine, to point out the many unknowns.  Instead, everything in the Bible and Torah was accepted as fact, but with a twist I could not anticipate.  The entire first three sections were composed of a small group of professors who re-cast the entire story away from the early Hebrews and Exodus tale, of escape from bondage under Egyptian slavery, with various Bible miracles.  Instead the ancient Hebrews were re-defined as a group of mercernaries bought by Pharaoh to guard the NE border of Egypt, and Moses -- after his fall from grace within the Egyptian hierarchy -- was transformed into a violent murdering war-lord.  There were no critical reference to any existing archaeology, or to note there was no archaeological or historical supports, save for some generic scenes out of old Egypt, as if that ""proved"" the accuracy of the ancient tales.  There were no images of the ruins of any of the cities of Cannan or Jericho, nor any of the archaeology which the old Bible tales were supposed to be detailing.  In this, both the religious Christian or Jew, and the secular scientist, will find to be a big disappointment.

But worse than mere disappointment, supplementing the talking heads of the selected professors, these first three programs of the DVD set re-cast the ancient Hebrews as bloodthirsty monsters, with constant CGI graphical re-creations of battles where merciless slaughter and added blood-splatter on your TV screen was the major theme.  Over and over again, when discussing Moses, he is shown as a war-lord of no redeeming values, sword in hand, throat-cutting and goring people, and sound-effects to go with it.

Surely, bloody battles occurred in ancient history just as in modern times. The Bible tales in the Book of Joshua indicated he led armies to battle and merciless slaughter in the Jordan River Valley regions, the old god Yawhe demanding much in the way of murder.  Some of that would have to be discussed in any critical evaluation of the Exodus story.  But instead, everything the Hebrews did was cast in that light, of being warrior-butchers and mass-murderers, without any comparable contrast to other tribes or nations who might have been similar, or to counter-arguments that they only occasionally descended into such disgraceful conduct.  The tales of Hebrew slavery under merciless Egyptian totalitarianism were turned instead to Hebrews in a military alliance with Ramses II, breaking free of Egypt to run off and pillage neighboring regions.  And that is the entire narrative, other than to make sometimes reasonable discussions of more natural scientific explanations for the Bible miracles.

But nowhere was it ever mentioned, especially as regarding the non-stop bloodletting, that it was merely the interpretation of this select group of professors, who due to an absence of corroborating facts, could re-write things however they wanted -- even while acting as if it was all proven ""history"".  These old Bible stories have no archaeological or historical proofs that any of it ever happened. Which is why honest Christians and Jews constantly say, it is a matter of faith.

The professors mention the old term ""hebiru"" or ""khibru"", and archaeology and ancient history DO record this as a generic term for desert nomads or ""wanderers"" of the region -- but without specificity.  It could just as easily identify the ancient Libyans, Sudanese and Arabs, or the Asiatic wanderers and warrior nomads who crossed into Mesopotamia and ancient Assyria, such as the Kurgans or Sythians and their derivative groups.  There is no historical proof that ""Khibru"" specifically identifies the people who later called themselves ""Hebrews"" or Jews.  ""Khibru"" has no fact-based specific connection to the modern Jews of Israel either, even if some Jewish theologians would insist upon it.  The Jewish claims to an ancient kingdom of Israel does have certifiable archaeology to support it, as with the remains of the old Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, but that was a thousand years after Exodus.  Events of the Old Testament and Torah, from Abraham, Moses, Joshua, etc. have no certifiable archaeology, and there are no mentions of them to be found in stones, carvings, tablets, bas-reliefs, or ancient graves of the region dated to those times.  And much of later archaeology is also problematic, as when the time-period of ancient King David shows statues of Astoreth, the ""Queen of Heaven"" in the archaeological layers.  These facts, unearthed by Jewish archaeologists in Jericho and elsewhere, have infuriated the religious Jews.  But... science has a habit of doing that.

But... why was such simple clarification never given?  How can it be that modern archaeologists could discuss the Exodus tale as if it were proven fact, never mentioning it is so far undocumented, in the realm of mythology?  And then, to deliberately invent a new mythology of Moses as a violent warlord?  They could say he wore a red dress and rode a unicorn into battle  as well, given the absence of detail which, for some, invites ""filling in the blanks"" with whatever they can dream up.  Or, did those scholars mention all of this, but those parts deleted by the history-channel producers?

My impression is, the whole enterprise of those three segments had a political motivation, to slander modern Jews as bloodthirsty savages.  By using a one-sided interpretation of ancient Hebrews as bloodthirsty savages, led by a merciless throat-cutting Moses, with all other tribes or nations of the region being depicted as more ""noble warriors"" or ""civilized"".  With all the needless blood-splatter re-creations of battle-scenes -- replayed over and over such that 50% of the time that is what you see, with a blood-red background for the speakers -- what is one to conclude except they wish to slander modern Jews as being the same?  Maybe my interpretation of political motivations is incorrect, but why the abysmal failure to show the actual landscape and archaeology where these events supposedly took place? Even some satellite images could have helped.  Why were those presentations made as if were 100% proven history, when factually 0% is proven out by actual ruins or ancient bas-reliefs and such.  The Sumerian Mesopotamians also wrote about the ""Khibrus"",  but the Bible stories do not place the Jews in Iraq until after Nebuchadnezzar, whose armies invaded and wrecked a proven-Jewish Jerusalem and took the non-Khibru, non-wandering settled Jews of ancient Israel into slavery.

This DVD was a disappointment, and might have been cobbled together purely to be a tag-along to the big Hollywood movie ""Exodus"" that is now being shown.  Another reviewer indicated his confusion in purchasing this item, wrongly believing it was the Hollywood film.

I expected History channel to do a better job.  Silly me.",1421539200,10,8776,5.12280701754386

6708068,5,B00O2QWD62,"I was apprehensive about this DVD before I watched it; I don't think some people liked it.  But I thought it was great, especially the second story
on the  first Disc (two in the set).  The first episode told the traditional story of the EXODUS from the Christian Bibles point of view.  Combined with
some recreated effects, skeptical  opinions and interpretations  and added detail not shown in the movies made this very very interesting.  The
first story I believe was made sometime in the 1990s.  The second story told the Exodus from the Hebrew Bibles point of view.  And Moses does
not come off quite as well as he does in  the Movie or Christian versions.  He even argues with  God over things., and gets Him mad at him.
Joshua comes off even worse; after Moses died, he formed his army and seized towns,  butchering men, women and children. The story is told
in the second DVD along with a kind of history of Ramses II who actually was the  greatest of Kings and ruled 67 years and begat 90 kids.  Back
then the ancients did a lot of begetting!  After all, what else is there to do in Egypt except chase the ladies.  And it is great to be Pharaoh!
There is also a bit about the Ark of the Covenant.  But the bit about Joshua is both extremely interesting, but makes some people rather uneasy
with all the slaughter he engaged in.  Five Stars!  The second Exodus story is much newer that the first story and perhaps  more up-to-date.
I enjoyed this immensely!  Got mine from Amazon.  Enjoy!
