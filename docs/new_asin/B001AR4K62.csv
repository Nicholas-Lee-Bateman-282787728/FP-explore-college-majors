8279133,4,B001AR4K62,"Great story, great acting, great great movie. The music is awful.",1518048000,,65,5.0
8279134,3,B001AR4K62,"Worth it even if solely to watch a young Paul Dano do his thing. Obviously low budget, but solid work.",1510617600,,102,4.15
8279135,5,B001AR4K62,A very beautiful movie. Deep and immensely compassionate for the suffering of man. So beautiful and rare.,1501459200,,105,5.235294117647059

8279138,4,B001AR4K62,"This is a good film because it shows off Paul Dano's range. It's ultra-low budget but really shows off his acting ability as one of our most dramatic young actors. I purchased this film because I was impressed with him in small parts he played in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose,"" and ""Taking Lives"" and was excited for his part in the Brian Wilson Biopic ""Love and Mercy"" which was resplendent.",1440288000,,416,4.56
8279139,5,B001AR4K62,I really do not know how to describe this movie other than it is quite unusual and different from what you usually see in a lower budget film.  Paul Dano is excellent as always...this movie seemed somewhat abstract to me yet it had me watching and wanting more when it ended.  I am glad I purchased it and would recommend it.,1397865600,5,325,4.311475409836065
8279140,4,B001AR4K62,"I loved this film. It is fairly low budget, so bare that in mind. Then allow this authentic movie to work its magic. Dano is, as always, riveting.
It took very little time for me to believe what was going on. Once I was there, I was there.",1384646400,2,239,4.0
8279141,5,B001AR4K62,Paul dano rocks more more he is so talented I would rent every movie with him in it give us more,1381622400,2,96,3.619047619047619
