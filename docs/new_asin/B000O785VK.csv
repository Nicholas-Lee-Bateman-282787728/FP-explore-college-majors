8183624,1,B000O785VK,I had recently watched the Discovery series called Manhunt Unabomber. This is not that. I turned it off when they called the school in Nashville the University of Vanderbilt. Anything that pays so little attention to detail is not worth watching.,1514246400,,246,5.024390243902439
8183625,2,B000O785VK,it's like a made-for-tv movie . . . amazing they could screw-up such a fascinating story,1510704000,,88,4.5625
8183626,2,B000O785VK,"After watching ""UNABOMBER:  The True Story"" (UTS) I could write, ""This movie must've bombed at the box office,"" even though it seems to be a made-for-TV affair.  Or, ""UTS really just fizzles out at the end,"" although that would imply that the movie started out strong and then just became weaker along the way.  Or, I could say, ""The acting in UTS is as wooden as Ted Kaczyinski's cabin.""

I think the last description is probably the most accurate.

A while back, I read the book ""Unabomber: How the FBI Broke Its Own Rules to Capture the Terrorist Ted Kaczynski,"" which is a very good read from a retired FBI agent who hunted Ted Kaczynski.  And I am now watching ""Manhunt:  UNABOMBER"" (MU), an excellent mini-series from the Discovery Network on the life and crimes of not only a serial killer but a US-born domestic terrorist.  So, when I saw that UTS was available, even though it seems to be only available on DVD -- I prefer streaming nowadays for many reasons -- I bought it immediately, mostly because it's only a few bucks.

Well, maybe I should've been smart and just never opened this package when it arrived.

Most of the movie, I was either laughing or groaning.  In one scene, an actor goes off into a long soliloquy, and the other actors just stand there and look bored.  In another, Dave Kaczyinski -- Ted Kaczynski's brother -- buys his own plot of land in Texas, and Dave hooks up with a Mexican guy who's more than happy to help Dave work on his property, for free, of course.  The two become Amigos faster than you can say, ""Run!  It's a bomb!"" and I must say, that scene is more than cringe-inducing.  Talk about pandering garbage.

I think that UTS could've been good -- MU certainly is, so there's a story here just waiting to be opened -- but the writing doomed this effort from the start.  It needs a sense of urgency, which it just doesn't seem to have.  And neither the direction or acting came in to save the day, like a brave soldier willing to jump on a hand grenade in order to save his company.

Well, if you happen to get this thing in the mail, I'd recommend not opening it and just turning it over immediately to the bomb squad.  Well, I'll just defuse the situation, and end my review now.",1502236800,,2226,4.422604422604422
8183627,3,B000O785VK,"PLOT: HUNTING the crazy bomber~

1970s~ a bomb is seen letting off colored material in the mail hold of a jet. This is the first ""TRIAL run"" for the Crazy known as the Unabomber~ a series of mail bombs are received mostly by College professors and teachers. They explode some are horribly injured. With methodical planning and making the bombs themselves leave few clues. DEAN STOCKWELL is a postal inspector that works with a task force that followed the clues and crimes of the Unabomber. The bombings stop for a few years and then start. In the MONTANA woods there is a cabin housing a wooly looking man named Ted Kacynski who is a recuse/hermit with a college education and a strong dislike of ""TECHNOLOGY"" he feels is 'destroying life.' His brother David (ROBERT HAYS) takes on the way of his older brother TED and but the years pass and have him married and working. TED asks for money on a frequent basis but always claims to be flat broke. As the bombings now have a man delivering them in person a sketch has a man with a face and sun glasses on. Still all the blind ally's lead no where. When DAVID reads a published ""MANIFESTO"" WRITTEN by the UNABOMBER (a meandering huge gripe of modern life published by two national publications) reluctantly published with the promise no more people with be killed. CERTAIN PHRASES are used by his brother TED. DAVID finally contacts the authorities to help them find and capture the elusive BOMBER.....TED. TED is finally arrested and over 700 pieces of evidence seized at the cabin help convict him. This movie is good but spends too much time on DAVID, we never really get much of an UP CLOSE look at TED. Still an interesting look at a CRAZY with an agenda.",1428710400,,1709,4.584967320261438
8183628,5,B000O785VK,THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE MOVIE. I REALLY ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. I LOVE HISTORICAL MOVIES A LOT.,1423440000,,97,4.157894736842105
8183629,3,B000O785VK,"Pretty well done movie for a TV movie, but I am biased because I live in the same neighborhood where David and Linda lived when they solved the mystery. They did a great job of depicting their home- it looks just like the main style of home here.  Other than that, it seems pretty accurate from what I know about it.",1413072000,3,316,4.180327868852459
8183630,5,B000O785VK,its a great moive but I was shock he never was seen on the school grounds,1410134400,3,73,3.625
8183631,1,B000O785VK,"Poorly written, directed and acted.
How do you take a powerful story such as this and turn it into something so banal
and uninteresting?
Well, they managed to do it here.

A waste of time.

RE: cast: Tobin Bell, who was so quirky and convincing in Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, doesn't do much
in this film at all that is worth watching--and I suspect it isn't even his fault. This entire flick is absolutely without any merit whatsoever. Too bad.

Maybe one day a talented filmmaker will get it right.",1216080000,3,501,4.544444444444444
