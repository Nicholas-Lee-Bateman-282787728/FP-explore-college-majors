7895277,1,6305808112,"Well, I (we, my girlfriend and I) saw the first movie (the history of O) and it was very well done and very ""turning on"". Well, I paid a great deal of money for this movie (O2), why? Because it is a japanese release which is very rare and hard to find? Or because it's such good movie and a ""secret"" known only to connaisseurs? NO! I have NO idea why such a crappy boring movie is so expensive! Klaus Kinski is one of my favorite german actors, and I thought, well, if he's in this movie it can't be that bad... WRONG! Do not buy this movie if you saw (bought) the first one and thereby expect a worthy sequal!!! The hottest scene is in the beginning where Kinsi ""takes"" a woman on a table, that was it! The rest is an extremely boring story about the revoloution (who cares) and some silly and non sexual appealing pseudo sex scenes that the ""so called"" new O has to endure as a prostitute in a bordell! This doesn't make much sense, and the scenes are everything but ""erotic"" or ""BDSM related"", save your money on this movie! For the same amount of money you can buy yourself about 4 or 5 ""cool erotic"" movies, if you want to which ones to buy see my reviews!",1215993600,11,1161,4.164444444444444
7895278,5,6305808112,"This movie was really cool. I did not think so at first because the first version I watched was heavily cut and edited. It also seemed very stupid because all the voices were dubbed, including Klaus Kinski who was dubbed with the most annoying english accent. It seems like dear Klaus gets his german accent changed in a lot of low rate,grade F movies he as been in,I should know I am a huge fan.

  After watching the stupid and pointless R rated version of the junk,I thought it was down right horrible. This is including the voice talents of the movie. Then a friend brought me over the complete uncut,unrated,subtitled version of the video. Wow what a difference,this movie was completely x-rated. It had hard core sex in it,all the nudity you can handle,and scenes of torture.

  Of course men are going to love this movie because of the nudity of the females in it. I don`t know what women are going to think of this dirty little movie. I am woman and I loved it,it was soft core porno at it best. I love Klaus Kinski and I think he is very sexy,which some would not agree with me on the issue. It of course shows him naked a lot in this movie,which I enjoyed. I mean the man is way over 50 in this movie and looks great. I reccomend this movie for anybody who likes this sort of thing.",1180656000,20,1292,4.296296296296297
7895279,1,6305808112,"The Story of O automatically has interest for the sleaze scene crowd just based on the premise - innocent girl gets the stuffings beaten out of her and, shall we say, ""known"" in all sorts of different manners, in the Biblical sense.  The difficulty is that normally these movies tend to be on the serious side, and therefore rating them purely on sleaze points tends to get the movie fanciers all riled.

And you'd have to rank this version as serious indeed, despite a lot of serious indeed nudity, including some soft x stuff.  The presence of a very vampiric looking Klaus Kinski doesn't guarantee quality of course, the great man apparently had no scruples about work, including appearing in this thing fully nude, including his decidely hirsute posterior, whew.  All of which - production values, different colorization, lots of plot, etc., is besides the sleaze point.  Let's see what we got here worth snipping.

Unfortunately, pretty much zip.  There's a lot of nudity, including the equally hirsute heroine, but the only whipping going on is dudes, twice, once after a questionable in taste flashback.  I just don't see how you can rate a Story of O version on sleaze points without any racing stripes on O, so we'll have to give this one two honorary sleaze points for content and nudity, and then redact one for too much male nudity and the dual male whacking.  But it's worth a look just for the depravity of it all, and to say you saw Kinksi at his weirdest.",1151712000,5,1471,4.692607003891051
7895280,5,6305808112,"A delighful exercise in visual poetry ""Les Fruits"" uses the ""Story of O"" merely as a pretext for an uplifting tale of
submission and deliverance, inventing  what should be called the first porno-kabuki movie. It must be seen more than a few times to engage a full appreciation. To my mind i  compares only with
Greenway's ""8+1/2 Women"" and Matton's ""Spermula"" in the category of films that capture the true pathos of sex in narrative. But this one goes one step further in trying to bridge the gap between western and eastern erotics like no other film I've seen.
Kinsky is at his best/worst throughout, as an entirely repulsive
Sir Stephen. The chinese revolutionary setting is another
engaging sidelight which gives the whole possession/liberation
dialectics a depth which O never had. A rare jewel of a painting...",1021248000,13,817,4.956204379562044
7895281,1,6305808112,"I do think this movie was well written. But if youve ever read the story of O you would know that this senario is impossible. It couldn't have happened. In the end Sir Stephen left her. In this movie he is with her again. Like I said, impossible. I would watch it again if only to understand the complexities of D/s . This film is in french with english subtitles. now they do speak some english in it but I found it very hard to understand what was being said. I wish the whole thing, even the english, would have been subtitled.",984268800,5,530,4.205882352941177
7895282,3,6305808112,"I am not a big fan of the director. but i have the chance to view his other production which produced in Japan.  that's why I would say i know  him a bit and have expectation in some extend.  If u are not familiar with  this director, u must attracted by the exotic cover of the DVD but u may  feel disapponited after u viewed the film.  I don't group it with those  exotic movie and not even x-rated movie.  this is a thought of sex of the  director but not a entertaining moive for audience.  That's why i don't  think it is necessary to talk about its entertainment.  however, compare  with other of his films, I would think this maybe a failure to him.  Usually the reasons came from the director and the production company.  As  I know this is a cooperation between France and Japan.  With the French  paid for the produciton fee and the Japanese form a produciton team.  It  seems that Shuji Terayama can't break through his usual frame and not even  keep his usual standard.  In some way, I would say he might not have enough  freedom to explode what he wants.  I hope in the near future, his other  films may have the chacne to get published and show the world that he is  one of the genius in this industry.",967248000,11,1216,4.246696035242291
