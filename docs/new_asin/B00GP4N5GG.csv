With a few nice twists in the video. I've already invited a few friends over to view this and to have a short time to just relax and enjoy.  I will watch this many more times.  Thank you...",1462838400,,395,4.253333333333333

8626017,5,B00GP4N5GG,"As a collector of all things Floridian, I was predisposed to like this video and I already loved the music by Delius so there was no risk in buying this film. However, I was unprepared for the effect it would have on me. Life in the grove really is very sweet. This is the Florida most people miss and that is a shame because it is so achingly beautiful in its own way. Not everyone will see it. The story is told with simple devices that allow the music and images to dominate. Florida is the center and man is just a piece of the many events, some cataclysmic, that occur reflecting the passage of time, death and renewal. I know I will be able to see much symbolism in this movie and watch it over and over. One thing is very plain. This movie was made with love and is worth every penny.",1397952000,2,791,4.142857142857143
