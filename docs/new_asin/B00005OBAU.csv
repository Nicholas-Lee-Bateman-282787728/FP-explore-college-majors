7948802,5,B00005OBAU,"Brilliant background to the pioneers, props, gifted and talanted artists, after viewing this documentary, for me personally the true meaning of the words 'Commitment'  and 'Dedication' have a far deeper meaning.

My only misfortune is I have never been able to witness a live performance.

May they continue to fill minds with passion and wonder.

7948805,1,B00005OBAU,"This is not what you want to buy if you want to see action, art or music.  This is a documentary that doesn't do justice to the spectacular group. Hardly any sequence represents the true escence of the acts because they are very few and interrupted. The editing is poor. The content is mostly interviews.",1009238400,27,304,4.527272727272727
