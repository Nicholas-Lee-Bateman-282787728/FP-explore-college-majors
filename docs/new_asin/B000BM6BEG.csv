8213282,5,B000BM6BEG,"I don't know what the delay on the release of this is! I happen to have a copy via PBS, and I can say this much, this is more of a true ""live"" LLB show than Texican Style. Even though it was filmed, Fillmore does away the rollercoater ""MTV style"" cameras, and the sound on here is more of a true live sound as opposed to all the overdubs that were on Texican Style. This is much better than the live CD version of this show, that was released in 2005, it's unedited (you get the WHOLE show), and even the mix of the sound on here differs from the CD. Overall, a must buy...when you are allowed to! Will you really be able to buy this on October 10, 2010, now that you have waited 5 years???",1168819200,6,690,4.007246376811594
