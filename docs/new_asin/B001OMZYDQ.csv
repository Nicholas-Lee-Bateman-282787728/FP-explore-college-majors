3730645,5,B001OMZYDQ,"""History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi"" or just ""Kenichi"" one of my favorite anime/manga series of recent years. Kenichi has been bullied all his life and has no friends but everything turns around when he meets and befriends Miu. Miu's a beautiful girl who just transferred to his high school who happens to live at her grandfather's old dojo with several martial arts masters.

Kenichi's story is one of a coward who breaks free of his destiny to be picked on his entire life and decides to become strong to defend the weak (and mostly defending Miu who really doesn't need protection). Kenichi mixes comedy, action/fighting, with a bit of romance very nicely. It doesn't go overboard with the fighting unlike most anime fights these days; no kamehamehas or super-human power-ups. Instead it opts for a more realistic approach detailing forms of Kung Fu, Jujitsu, Muay Tai, and Karate.

The closest similar series I could compare it to would be Hajime no Ippo (or ""Fighting Spirit"" it's english title). I definitely recommend Kenichi.",1237852800,,1035,5.046783625730995
3730646,5,B001OMZYDQ,"Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple is a simple action comedy that is very entertaining.  The character himself is the nice guy underdog who is completely isolated at the beginning.  Since his strength is lacking and he has no friends he is often mocked at the very least and beat on the very worst.  I don't want to talk about key points in the plot but its engaging to see Kenichi evolve to become both physically and emotionally stronger.  His training and the various interactions between characters are quite humorous and the fights are well done.

When he fights a tough opponent it is plausible he is able to be a contender because his training is not only sadistically harsh and long but also he learns counter moves.  They go into great detail about the fighting styles in this anime.  What they are used for, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they are learned (performed).  I hope my review was helpful and I hope enough people enjoy (purchase) Kenichi that funimation will license the rest of the show (they licensed 26 out of 50 episodes to test the product.)

This DVD Contains 13 Episodes and B will have 13 Since Funi only licensed the first 26.  Trailers and clean opening/ending are the only special features included here... standard/generic special features only. Total Run time for the 13 episodes is 312 Minutes.

3730683,5,B001OMZYDQ,"A mix martial arts anime. Learning how to do martial arts and using them are two totally different things. Here is my review for Kenichi The Mightiest Disciple!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) Kenichi Shirahama was a normal 16 year old high schooler. He is good in class and he joined the garden club. Only thing is every bully picks on Kenichi and beats him up, A LOT. One day he joins the school karate club to learn how to defend him self. Except all the school bullies are in that club and beat Kenichi up more. One of them challenges Kenichi to a match, loser leaves the club forever. While he is worrying about his fight and how he will get beaten up he sees a girl in trouble. The girl is surrounded by thugs and the girl is protecting another guy who is down on the ground who got beat up by the thugs.  Wanting to protect her, Kenichi jumps to action but fall flat on his face. The girl suddenly attacks the thugs and beats them all without breaking a sweat. After winning The girl introduces her self as  Miu Furinji. Miu thanks Kenichi and wonders why he tried to help. He tells her that he didn't like seeing girl's get picked on and he needs training. She recomends the dojo she lives at called Ry'zanpaku (pronounced Re-O-Zen-Pa-Coo). When Miu and Kenichi get there he is greeted by the 6 masters who live there. Kenichi says he wants to learn all martial arts they all know so he become a student of all the masters, and from there is where the real journey begins!

The 6 masters who live at Ry'zanpaku and train Kenichi are,
  Hayato F'rinji: the owner of Ryozanpaku and Miu's grandfather, his fighting style is a mixed hybrid style. His skill is so amazing he is able to run on water and is considered the best of the best at the dojo, he trains Kenichi only in late last part of season 2, otherwise he is a wise old man who gives good advice.

Akisame K'etsuji: Akisame is the one who first trains Kenichi in the art of Jujutsu. He is the resident jack of all trades at the dojo, by that I mean Akisame is shown to have mastered the art of sculpting, pottery, calligraphy, writing. He also owns a medical clinic called Bone Setters which is just a chiropractor's clinic who also does regular medicen like a real doctor. Akisame is also the resident philospher.

Shio Sakaki: Sakaki is the resendents Karate master. He is shown wearing a leather vest and he drinks alot. He is tough as nails but knows what hes doing. He is normally the toughest on Kenichi.

 Apachai Hopachai: (my personal fave of the group) Apachai is the Muay Thai fighter of the group. He is shown as having a childs heart but a totally kick ass fighting style. He is also shown as well lets say the least smart of the entier group. He is hardest on Kenichi during training, by that I meaning due to Apachai's past of being forced into death battles where he must kill the oppoent to survive, Apachai normally can't hold back his strength most of the time. So he comedically ""kills"" Kenichi when ever they are training.

 Shigure K'saka: Shigure is the weapons master of the group. She is mostly quiet and doesn't talk much. She is considered a loner. She only trains Kenichi three times throught the entire series. Shigure owns a pet mouse called Toch'maru who is a comedic relife in the show.

  Kensei Ma: he is the kenpo master of the group but is said to know all chinese martial arts style. He is the Ry'zanpaku resendential pervert who normally takes pervy picts of Shigure and Miu when ever he can. Along with Akisame, Kensei owns a medical clinic in which he does acupuncture.

Pros: this series is amazing, the fighters are 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED. The begining half of the series (to me) sees more screwball comedy like then serious fighting. The show is really funny. The action is good at time but sometimes the fights could have been a bit better but they are still good.

Cons: Biggest con I really hate about this series is the ""Last time on Kenichi the mightiest disciple"" segment. At the begining of each episode the recap the last episode, but its really really long. I mean the recap last anywhere from 2 minutes to the longest of 6 minutes. So 22 minutes per episode and (from what I remember) the recaps are 4 to 5 minutes long. So you only get 17 to 18 minutes of show instead of a full 22 minutes.

Cons part 2: Sadly to thoses who wanted a more serious fighting anime compared to the fighting style of DBZ where its all action 98% of the time, this show puts the action more at, 30% action to a 70% comedy.

Overall: I really liked this series, I laughed alot! I say buy this series!!!!!",1456876800,,4610,4.408716136631331

3730720,5,B001OMZYDQ,"(pre-review warning: I'm not the absolute best at remembering how to spell some of the characters' names)

Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple is one of the greatest shows I've ever watched. I was intrigued when I saw the advertisement on one of my Dragon Ball Z DVDs, and the premise of a wimp being trained by the world's greatest martial arts masters quickly caught my interest. Little did I know what sort of action-packed, comedy-peppered stories I was getting myself into!

If you don't already know, the basic story is this: Kenichi Shirahama is a wimpy, cowardly highschool freshman with an interest in karate. He bumps into Miu Furinji, a blonde, busty transfer student girl that is new at school. They quickly become friends, and when Kenichi faces expulsion from the karate club due to his lack of physical skill by the bullies that run the club, Miu offers to lead him to the dojo of the seven martial arts masters of the world. From there, Kenichi trains under the zany masters in the pursuit of getting stronger. Each and every master has a distinct personality and they all endear themselves to you as time goes on. Apachai, Shigure, Akisame, Sakaki, Kensei, and Hayato all stand out (both in a crowd of normal-looking people and amidst the crowds of other fictional characters). The other side-characters, such as Nijima, Honoka, Takeda, Ukita, are all memorable and very likeable. Even the jerk Nijima eventually becomes a character you welcome to see, even if he seems like a weasel at first.

The action is great, mostly because you get to watch as Kenichi learns the techniques and then apply them, learning to use them as he goes. Frankly, you have to suspend your disbelief just a little bit (how can a highschool sophomore split a cinder block with a single kick?) but for the most part the fighting is exhilarating and keeps you enticed. Some people have noted that the slowed-down moments where the characters speak their thoughts breaks the rhythm of the fighting, but that's up to you to judge. I've never found a problem with it. The enemy fighters are all specialized in certain styles and are all at varying skill levels, so Kenichi's constantly working harder and harder with the Masters to learn new techniques and increase his physical ability.

The action is supplemented by bits of comedy here and there, and I've always found them to be hilarious. Kenichi's cowardly attitude is played for laugh many a time, and usually it doesn't feel too forced, since you learn quickly that no matter how much he trains, Kenichi lacks any large amount of courage. Each master has their own quirks, which bothers Kenichi and confuses him to no end. Some of the jokes focus on a traditional topic: hot girls. Kenichi knows how shapely Miu and Shigure are, and Kensei, the Chinese Kenpo Master, is your traditional perverted old man. Nosebleeds do occur once or twice, and they're hysterical to witness while Kenichi rambles on excitedly. There definitely are some scenes built for softer amounts of fanservice (Miu in a leotard; case closed) but there is no nudity or anything too inappropriate.

The animation of the show is really great, and the dub is absolutely fantastic (let it be known that I am NOT an anime hardcore, so this opinion is probably best for the casual fans). Everything looks and sounds fantastic, and the music choices for this show are all really fitting and, in some cases, very catchy. ""Be Strong"" and ""Catch Your Dreams"" are my favorites, but they're all good. This set lacks any special features other than the textless songs and some trailers, but I've come to expect that from these DVD sets from Funimation.

Overall, I am VERY satisfied with this series. I recently ordered the second ""season"", although it's hard to see them as separate seasons and more of just one big arc, which is what they actually are. I highly recommend this show to any and everyone interested in it. I feel it was worth every penny!",1401753600,5,3957,4.794721407624634

Making matters worse standing up to the bullies who used to pick on him only incites the citys delinquent gangs to want to test his new skills.

The animation is top notch, the characters are entertaining, the story is both hilarious and compelling with an excellent English dub making this series a must own for any anime fan and one of my favorite Shonen animes!

  Came a little worn due to buying a used copy, a little scatched but not enough to ruin the whole  thing. Still workable and in great condition. Still one of my favorites, want to always sit down with this one and watch it even if it's just me.

If fact you can say that you could learn a lot about what you can achieve with hard work. If Kenichi Shirahama was a real person (or even so) he is a character who you can say is worth looking up to.

3730739,5,B001OMZYDQ,"I wouldn't normally be saying that about a fighting anime. Usually the story and characters of that genre just don't appeal to me. That couldn't be further from the truth in this case. This show is so well done I just couldn't help but to fall for it. In fact every now and then I invite my anime loving friends over and we marathon the series from beginning to end over a few days. It just never get's old.

Kenichi The Mightiest Disciple is about a boy known by many as ""Weak Knee's Kenichi"" Who has spent most of his life being pushed around. What others didn't notice about him was while he was taking those beatings he never gave in. What he lacked wasn't heart, it was strength, endurance, and most of all training. From the beginning his masters explained to him in no uncertain terms he has absolutely no natural talent, mental or physical. He would have to struggle against nature itself to be remade. That in a nutshell is what this show is all about. Be warned the show is extremely silly at times but that's the world of Kenichi. I recommend this anime to anyone who likes fighting anime's but also to those who (like me) are kind of turned off by them. This show is different enough from your standard beat'em up that its worth a look. I think you'll be glad you did. I can tell you without one bit of buyers remorse that I own the whole series.",1376524800,,1358,4.325490196078431
3730740,5,B001OMZYDQ,"This is one of my favorites as far as animated shows to watch. There is great comedy, lots of intense action, great protagonists and some pretty dark antagonists. Like some Japanimes, this deals with a young (male) hero facing great adversity, and trying to be the ever-growing odds against him. This time, the hero is Kenichi Shirahama, a high school student who desperately wants to be a martial artist, but has neither practiced nor trained a day in his life. He does, however, have a lot of books on the subject. When he meets Miu Furinji, all of that changes when she introduces him to the Masters of Ryozanpaku. Seeing something in Kenichi, something he doesn't even see in himself, the five Masters, and the Grandmaster, take Kenichi in to learn the ways of marital arts.

As Kenichi trains in multiple styles, his limits (physical, mental...and perv) are tested again and again. Along the way, he meets some great friends, and some dangerous enemies in the form of Ragnarok, a dangerously powerful gang of martial artists who use their skills to run the streets. Kenichi, who has vowed to never use his skills to harm an innocent, must quickly gain more knowledge as more and more skilled foes come looking for a fight.

In all honesty, both seasons are great. There are some episodes (as with all TV shows) that aren't as good, but they do not detract from the viewing experience. I have watched both seasons more than once and can continue to do so for a long time to come. There are some very humerous moments, and a few dark moments but not so dark that it would prevent a younger audience from watching. There are some cliched life lessons tossed in from time to time, and some suprising heart-wrenching moments (certain backstories really get to me) and throw in some well animated action scenes and great voice acting, you have one of my favorite animes of all time.

Enter Miu, the pretty judo neighbor.  Underneath that physical powerhouse is a heart of gold and a fist of steel... not to mention legs that could break a stone wall into a million pieces just by smacking it with them once or twice.  And as fate may have it, she's a sweetie too.  She has taking a liking to our hero and therein lies the problem.  Because of this attraction, this has made him the hatred of every guy in his class as if they didn't hate him enough already.  So Miu could only think of one thing to do for him... take him to train with her at her grandfather's dojo.

Probably every eight months or so I watch through it again, mostly because I'm bored. I get drawn into it all over again, and never get that nostalgia-breaking sense of ""how did I enjoy this"". Great pacing, great comedy, entertaining characters that you can't wait to see what they do next.

I watched with the Japanese language, so the English dubbing that came out more recently sounds strange to me. However it is a great show. They may sound a bit different, but the characters are still there.

I've introduced it to family and friends, and all that have watched it loved it from beginning to end.

There's many ways to watch this show, but this is worth adding to an anime collection. If for no other reason than to be able to watch it with the Japanese language commercial free.

3730768,4,B001OMZYDQ,"An anime series about a boy learning martial-arts from a gang of masters sounds... kinda boring. Fortunately it's anything but -- ""Kenichi: Season One"" is a solid start to this deliciously oddballish series, with plenty of gutsplitting comedy, explosive action, a hint of romance, and extremely eccentric martial artists.

Throughout his school life, Kenichi Shirahama has been weak, bullied, friendless and nicknamed ""weak knees."" He enters the high school karate club to become stronger, but quickly finds himself at the bottom of the food chain -- and challenged to a match by a big muscled thug.

But his life is unexpectedly saved by the new transfer student Miu, who can beat down an entire street gang. She guides him to the dojo where she lives... and where five martial arts masters currently reside, each at the peak of their skill and strength. Unsurprisingly Kenichi joins up with the hope of becoming stronger, but he soon discovers that their methods are kind of brutal (think racing around the city pulling jiujitsu master Akisame in a tire!).

Unfortunately, his martial-arts win only leads to more trouble -- he attracts the attention of various thugs, and gains the attention of the strongest gang in the city, Ragnarok. And moving into the dojo doesn't end the danger, as he finds that some of his friends -- including an ex-member of Ragnarok -- are being targeted by their thugs. What's more, he has no idea how close one of the gang's elite fighters is...

""Kenichi: Season One"" quickly introduces us to the characters and scenario, then plunges right into the world of martial arts training. But on a deeper level, ""Kenichi"" is also about a young man who gains not only physical strength but mental endurance, and how his innocent quest to be strong rapidly escalates into something far more life-changing.

And.... it's funny. REALLY funny. Every episode is packed with slapstick, insane training (the Great Leg Divide -- a sort of medieval torture device), eccentric characters (""Riiiiiise, SEBASTIAN!""), and tsunamis of hormones whenever Kenichi gets within two feet of Miu. All this humor keeps the series from getting too deadly serious.

And there's also a lot of action that twists through the various episodes, as Kenichi is confronted by all sorts of opponents -- karate, boxing, street fighters, knife-wielding thugs -- and has to use different techniques to defeat them. Lots of special punches, low kicks, pivots, body-weight throws and other fun techniques.

But Kenichi himself is a strong point -- he's a likable and earnest kid who hasn't been soured by his constant mistreatment at school, and who just wants to be strong enough to defend himself and other people. And it doesn't go to his head, since he shows immense compassion towards the people he defeats. Miu is also an excellent female lead in the vein of Tite Kubo's Orihime -- busty, friendly, industrious, naive, and just a little bit weird.

And the supporting characters have a brilliance of their own: there's Miu's imposing grandpa, the rough and blunt Sakaki, the silent sword-swinging Shigure, the lecherous Kensei, and the vast and deadly child-man Apachai (""Only limit is limit of fear!""). Takeda the Puncher makes a good buddy/rival for Kenichi... and for the record, all the voice actors are simply brilliant..

""Kenichi: Season One"" is a solid start to a thoroughly enjoyable series, crammed with martial-arts fighting and loads of comedy. Apapapapa!",1309219200,16,3461,5.068541300527241

3730771,5,B001OMZYDQ,"I like anime, although I haven't watched a lot of it, and my tastes are for anime with humor as well as action. (My favorites include ""Inuyasha"" and ""Full Metal Alchemist"") Well ""Kenichi, The Mightiest Disciple"" fills the bill. Often the Japanese sense of humor one finds in anime doesn't translate well for us Americans, but ""Kenichi"" is a happy exception. There is a lot of well-done slapstick in this anime, primarily having to do with martial arts training and Kenichi's (the boy hero of the title) innate timidity and clumsiness. Kenichi himself is a triumph of a character - yes, he's the hero and yes, he does a lot of ""kung-fu fighting"" (not to mention a dash of ju-jitsu, boxing and other martial disciplines), but he's hardly Naruto - in fact, if anything, he's the anti-Naruto. He has no natural martial-arts talent whatsoever (as his masters constantly - and somtimes painfully - remind him), but manages to survive mostly on stubborness and determination. He doesn't learn his lessons in the hope of becoming great, but so he can protect others; ego has nothing to do with his ambitions. And he takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin' - he's put through a great deal of pain, which he protests loudly (and hilariously) and while he whines about his training a lot, it just makes him more believable and lovable. It's refreshing to see a character in anime who's genuinely funny and not just weird; Kenichi is an everyman that everyone in every country can identify with and care about.

The supporting characters in this anime are solid and add to the humor and drama significantly. They are a collection of ""types"" - tough guy, philosopher, sullen silent warrior, big lovable lug who doesn't know his own strength, and big-breasted bimbo - yet they have a depth that saves them from being dull or annoying.  The ""bimbo"" is a character named Miu, who befriends Kenichi early on and becomes his love interest (a development she seems mostly ignorant of), and it's fun to see Kenichi's innocent lust over her, (although it's a big startling when he springs a nosebleed whenever he becomes aroused...apparently, that's a traditional Japanese-manga expression of sexual desire, weird huh?) and his eternal frustration is yet another aspect of the character that makes him so endearing.  Best of all, Miu's a really a likable character, and the pair make a truly appealing couple.

As for the martial arts aspect of the series, the fights and descriptions of the various fighting techniques are involving and interesting. There is a battle at one point between Kenichi and a character named Hermit that displays some spectacular animation that really blew me away.

""Kenichi"" is an anime that's safe for kids and enjoyable for older kids (like me). It's really one of the best humor animes to date, and I highly recommend it. Seasons 1 and 2 are out now. Here's hoping for a season 3!",1306195200,,2889,4.828282828282828

When I do, I realize if I had I'd have become seriously rich, and could do lots fo things like finance a movie or a TV series.  After saving Firefly, the Joss Whedon series, the next thing I think I'd want to finance would be History's Strongest Disciple.  Yeah, I know that's not the US title of this, but it's still the one I know it by. Kenichi was not received as well as it could have been by fan groups cause many of them were expecting a straight martial arts show.  Kenichi is more of a comedic series with an interesting martial arts twist.  The martial arts part is blown up to be a bit larger than life, but it works on both a comedic and an action level.  The character development in Kenichi is stellar and that's why I think it would make a good live action series as well as anime.  Not that far into the series, we all seem to have a handle on his family, his school friends, his enemies, and the mystical dojo that houses six masters of various martial arts.

The plot is simple, I'm not really sending spoilers by saying Kenichi is a wimp who wants to be more than that, and gets his wish with the chance meeting of a new girl at school Miu.  They have met before a long time ago, but only Miu puts it together at their first meeting. It is through her that Kenichi gets his opportunity to change himself.  There is a subtle point which was meant to preserve the comedy and perhaps prolong the series early on.  To explain that I'll go to the manga series, of which there are two.  In the first the plot is different and Kenichi becomes a fighter for different reasons and gets stronger much sooner.  After about 40 chapters or so they scrapped that story, and started a new one from scratch.  In the new version which echos the anime, Miu is the one who drives Kenichi more, and in this case involves him in something the masters would have spared him from.

While this is a small spoiler, I'll tell you it cause it can be missed if you don't pay close attention.  Kenichi, like most people wants to get himself out of a bind, but he would never have chosen the path he took had he known what it implied.  The bind he was in involved the Karate club, where he is challenged by a much larger new member who plans to beat the crap out of him, and force him to leave the club.  After Miu gets Kenichi involved with the masters, a funny enough introduction in it's own right, they train him with harsh conditioning methods.  Miu, feeling sorry for him, and overhearing the person he's going to fight boast about the beating he'll get, teaches him an advanced technique.  In the end he wins, but the move is illegal, so he leaves the Karate club, but not without attracting some attention from the upperclassman in the club.  You see the thing the masters knew, that Kenichi and Miu did not, was that if he was conditioned and had no knowledge of technique, a person with no natural martial arts aptitude like himself, would survive the beating. He could then go on with his everyday life mostly unfettered. Unfortunately, since Miu teaches him an advanced technique, now stronger and stronger fighters will now come at him till he'd finally completely defeated, or he has to get stronger to beat them.  What he finds out is he'll now likely spend the rest of his life battling new challengers.

What makes Kenichi so funny?  It's often in the crazy training techniques, like the squid dance where Kenichi is hung on a spit over an open fire fanned by one of his masters, and has to keep twisting back and forth to keep from getting fried.  This helps develop the abs, rather quickly I would assume, or he might be giving the master a ride by pulling him on a tire.  He once asked if there was a faster way to get in shape while doing this, and the master said their was...  Kenichi waited to hear about it, whereby the master produced a whip, then told him to pull him on the tire faster!  Other funny scenes involve Kenichi's father and his pet shotgun Sebastian, his busybody sister, who thinks Kenichi, (and she may be right) has been seduced away to this dojo by Miu's large chest. There is humor in the foes he fights as each one has his share of quirks, from a cat loving female kick artist, to a crazy aristocrat, who composes and hears music in his fighting.  There is humor in the interaction between the masters, composed of a childlike monster who can't control his power, to a female master of weapons who is constantly fighting the perverted attempts to photograph her by the Chinese master, a drunken Karate master who says he refuses to take disciples, and Kenichi's philosopher, artist, and mentor who constantly tricks him into getting stronger.  There is humor in Kenichi's forked tongued, alien like, or demon like friend, who plans to use him to conquer the world, and then lead it himself.  Kenichi generally can become serious enough when the fighting starts, but is more often humourous when there is not a battle going on.

It's been a couple years since the series aired, and they do not seem to be interested in making more at this time.  This is unfortunate because the manga has material to do three times or more the number of episodes they've produced.  The manga is on it's 353 chapter as I write this. This is the first part of season one, and officially there was only one season of 50 episodes.  Funimation has only half that season licensed, so hopefully they will pick up the second half.  The stories a somewhat episodic so this is a fair way to release them, but it would be nice to collect the entire season.  As for me, I'm still thinking who I'd cast in the parts fo the various characters, who knows, I might win the lotto one day, and I'd love to make this into a hit live action series in the states.",1253318400,5,5850,4.403345724907063
3730785,5,B001OMZYDQ,"This is a common theme in many Anime.  It is a martial arts in school series that has comedic moments through the show.  It doesn't contain any nudity but it does have jokes about the co-star's large breasts however.  It reminds me of the original Karate Kid, only with the female star being more skilled than the protagonist.
