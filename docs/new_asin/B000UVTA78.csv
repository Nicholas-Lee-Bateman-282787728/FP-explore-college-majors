2925957,5,B000UVTA78,Keith has a great teaching style and his course makes me sound like I'm actually a musicican!,1240963200,2,93,4.529411764705882
2925958,5,B000UVTA78,Keith Wyatt delivers. Why this guy doesn't just form a blues band record and tour I don't know. You can see he's a complete musician. Very comfortable in front of the camera and takes his time explaining everything he's doing. I highly reccomend this dvd even for advanced players you'll pick up a few licks.,1219104000,3,308,4.618181818181818
2925959,4,B000UVTA78,"This DVD ""Rockin The Blues"" by Keith Wyatt is a great instructinal tool for learning and playing blues and rockibilly. I really enjoyed playing along with him throught this entire DVD,he has a cool ""Big Brother you wish you had"" style to his playing. The other thing that sruck a chord with me was that he never over complicates his explainations of how different chord structures and lead's mesh and work with each other.
The sound quality on this dvd is perfect as well as the camera work and angles.
You can also tell that he is comfortable in his teaching method and interaction with the camera. The playalong sections he does are in my opinion one of the best teaching methods,Keith takes a solo run while the backing blues tracks are playing then you try and emulate what he has just played...and repeat. This is the method that will help most people learn good solo structure.
There are only a few really good teachers out there on DVDs and Keith is one of them, The other that i would recomend is Matt Gurman. If you only bought these two's DVDs you would be far ahead in learning to play solid Blues.
Hope this helped you out.",1194825600,22,1135,4.48792270531401

8215274,5,B000UVTA78,I have several of his DVD's and find they are good but repetitive from DVD to DVD. Like the first couple chapters in most books.,1489536000,,128,4.16
8215275,5,B000UVTA78,"Keith Wyatt is the man! His products are always focused on getting the sound into your hands as quickly as possible. He explains only the necessary theory to understand the particular move or lick you are learning, and always does it with cool humor. Keith teaches the blues, plays the blues and rocks the blues! Great stuff.",1425340800,,325,4.719298245614035

8215278,5,B000UVTA78,"This is really helpful. Obviously depending on your level of playing but if you want to get going with learning blues, this is a great start. The video is a bit old, but Kieth was already a great teacher so it doesn't matter.",1348012800,,225,4.255813953488372
8215279,3,B000UVTA78,"Theres not much here, title is misleading. Short DVD (45 minutes?). You will learn how best to play Steveie Ray Vaughan's Pride an Joy Rythum(thats really about it on the rythum and pretty much sets the style of the DVD). Keith does do the best job of explaining how to get this rythum down and gives great tips. He covers basic turn arounds, beginings and  endings for basic blues. He will show you a couple of riffs, not much (sparse), he will again explain them well. He does cover targetting notes from the chords for use in riffing and gives great examples of this but still it's sparse. He mentions using major pentatonics (and when to use them) with limited examples. However in the end your feeling that there should have been more. It's for intermediate beginers (if that makes sense) but beginers will benefit from it (no basics taught - you should already be a blues player - even if only a beginner). It's really a short  quick tutorial on targetting chord notes, using major pentatonics and tips on Stevies Pride an Joy rythum. Not a DVD on how to Rock the Blues. Just a Blues tip DVD (they are helpfull tips and they are well explained).",1299196800,4,1151,4.528846153846154
8215280,5,B000UVTA78,I've owned this on VHS for quite a while and it's always worth revisiting (even to the point of wearing out the tape). The price to replace my old tape with DVD was well worth it. Keith Wyatt is a great instructor and that comes through in this video perfectly!,1284940800,,261,4.24
8215281,4,B000UVTA78,"Keith Wyatt is an excellent teacher and a fine guitar player.  I have seen a few of his DVDs, and I like them all.  Anyone who is a beginner and wants to learn more licks should check out this DVD.  It is helpful and presented in a format that makes the lessons easy to follow.",1248393600,2,277,4.0
