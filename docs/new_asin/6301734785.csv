It is very unfortuate that Ralph Byrds career had ended so abruptly due to a heart attack.  I believe he was 46 years of ago.  However, after RKO stopped making the Dick Tracy full length films Ralph Byrd was offfered a TV series based on the comic book characters from the comics.  He was successful in portraying Tracy on TV for at least two years.  I enjoyed watching these shows and the series were not very violent.  If you are interested in watching TV series I would recommend to the public these Dick Tracy lost shows..",1453248000,,629,4.333333333333333

SYNOPSES--
DICK TRACY: DETECTIVE (home video name for the simply titled ""Dick Tracy"")
Tracy goes up against 'Splitface' (Mazurki), a hideously scarred killer who first extorts money from and then slashes the throats of his victims. Tracy questions a star-gazing professor (Bardette) after finding the potential murder weapon (a knife) under the man's mattress. When the professor gazes into a crystal ball and predicts that a dozen more will soon die, he's taken in for questioning.

DICK TRACY MEETS GRUESOME (aka ""Dick Tracy meets Karloff"")
Boris Karloff receives top billing in one of the more popular entries in this movie series. He's an ex-convict who uses nerve gas to paralyze victims while his gang robs banks. Features such colorful character names as 'Dr. I.M. Learned,' 'X Ray,' 'Dr. Lee Thal' and 'Dr. A. Tomic.' (Note: The last big screen job for Tom Keene, who cameos here as Dr. Frankey, was Col. Tom Edwards in Ed Wood's 1959 classic turkey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLAN-9-FROM-OUTER-SPACE/dp/B001BSBBGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE</a>.

353238,4,6301734785,"(...) the three films and a scant extras on CLASSIC DICK TRACY make it a tremendous value.
 The films:
 Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome - Boris Karloff plays Gruesome, who robs banks and likes to incinerate his victims.
 Dick Tracy vs. Cueball - Dick Wessel plays Cueball, who steals diamonds and likes to strangle his victims with a leather strap.
  Dick Tracy's Dilemma - Jack Lambert plays The Claw, who steals furs and likes to hack his victims with the hook at the end of his right arm.
 The extras: Short text biographies of Boris Karloff and Dick Tracy creator Chester Gould, a very short selected Karloff filmography, and a harmless page or two of Dick Tracy trivia.

 ""Gruesome"" and ""Dilemma"" star Ralph Byrd as Tracy, a role his square jaw suggests he was born to play.  Morgan Conway plays the super cop in ""Cueball.""  Byrd played Tracy in an earlier serial, while Conway was the first to play him in a movie.
  These short films were produced by RKO Radio Studios, which gave us some of the greatest psychological crime dramas in history.  The production values, cinematography, and supporting cast are all above average for these quickly produced low budget films.
  RKO gilded its reputation by presenting films that probed the twisted psychology or its heroes and villains.  The beauty of formulaic entries like these Dick Tracy movies is that they avoid that approach entirely.  The Bad Guy is wired to receive signals from nothing higher than his reptile brain.  Gruesome, Cueball, and the Claw are simply evil, all greedy appetite with a well-honed fight-or-flight response.  They have no depth at all.  The short biography on Gould tells us that he wrote Tracy in reaction to the ""glamorized"" gangsters of the 1930s.  He wanted to give the public a Good Guy to root for.  Ergo Dick Tracy, a vacant trenchcoat and fedora who's hardwired to that attic space in the brain that controls our dedication to Justice and fighting Evil.  Beyond canceling dinner dates with sweetheart Tess Trueheart (a running gag throughout all the movies, one which wore thin pretty quick) and chasing criminals, there isn't much to Tracy's personality.  The criminals may have been drained of their glitz, but they're still a lot more interesting than the hero.
  I enjoyed all these movies immensely.  I'm not all that familiar with Dick Tracy, but I imagine we have Gould to thank for having his villains hang out with characters like Filthy Flora in such colorfully named dives as The Hanging Noose and the Dripping Dagger.  Vitamins Flintheart, a bad and annoyingly flamboyant actor, and Tracy sidekick, seems a Gould character as well. The transfer seems uniformly well done.  Things stay in focus and there's no buzzing on the soundtrack.  Better yet, the transfer prints were in very good shape, considering their age.  Best of all, these pleasant films are suitable for all ages.",1098144000,9,2877,4.894409937888199

But it has a very distinctive villain with a hook for a hand.  So however it was that i found a description of it I knew what it was.  Any way that is why i bought this.  It was very exciting to me as a kid.  And it still is.  I hadn't seen the other two movies.  Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome which has Boris Karloff in it.  Or Dick Tracy vs. Cueball both they  are also pretty good.,1487376000,,529,3.761467889908257

The Dick Tracy comic strip began around 1930 when Chester Gould created it for the Chicago Tribune. Some said Dick Tracy was based on Eliot Ness, the famous Prohibition Agent of the US Treasury Department. It sought to influence public opinion to support the police in Chicago and elsewhere. Adults liked it because of its clever stories that appealed to them. Its villains were famous for their distinctive features, a belief fostered by some criminologists that is now out of date. It was continued after the retirement of Chester Gould but was later dropped. Comic strips have a limited lifetime.

The RKO film factory ground out low budget movies. Morgan Conway and Ralph Byrd played Dick Tracy in these movies. Its popularity showed it met the needs and wants of its audiences (fighting crime in the city). The comic strip would also have interesting facts and tips for the general public. Crime dramas continue as a staple for movies and television today. For more details view the individual reviews for each movie.

Dick Tracy, Detective (1946) deals with the slashing murders of people. What is the connection? After the Mayor gets a death threat Dick Tracy figures out the solution and searches for the killer Splitface.

Dick Tracys Dilemma (1947) begins with a robbery-murder at a fur vault. They track the connection to The Claw. Dick Tracy pursues The Claw who meets his end while hiding by a high-voltage transformer.",1481673600,,1465,4.96734693877551
