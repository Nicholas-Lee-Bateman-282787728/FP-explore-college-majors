8577197,5,B00C3Q21RY,"(you can watch it on dramafever.com if you have not seen it) but ya  its funny as all hell and very emotional. Story was very good loved the actors they were perfect. I liked the plot. Some actors had me clenching my fist wanting to scream you bastard!!! LOVED how the grandchild  could cuss like a sailor and make cussing a artform lol.  I was very surprised how they could put just a tiny bit of romance in everything making it even more interesting and funny. credits made the show, they seemed like bloopers but not actually.",1400544000,,529,4.43298969072165
