8672539,5,B00MIA0GCW,"One reviewer gave this movie one star because, unexpectedly it was French and subtitled. In spite of such a brilliant review, I'm going to say that if it is not against your religion to watch a movie which is not American, and therefore may have subtitles, then you may laugh your head off watching this movie.

However, if you are a slow reader, or are vision impaired, or have an impaired sense of humor, then I DO NOT RECOMMEND this film to you.

But if you enjoy foreign films already, you may love it as much we did. The story is hilarious, the acting superb, as is everything else. If you have watched the French TV serial ""Spiral"", then you will recognize one of the actresses in this film (the one with red hair) as the one who plays the redheaded lawyer in ""Spiral"".  Even the ending is great -which I will not blab to you.

There are so many incredibly funny lines and situations that it boggles the mind. Fantastic writing, fantastic cinematography. Everything works, so well. This film is a MASTERPIECE.",1480636800,2,1015,4.530054644808743
8672540,3,B00MIA0GCW,"Rose is a former convict who works at a grocery store & has an estranged relationship with her son due to her time away in prison only to discover that he's a huge WWE fan causing her to make the decision to start training to become one herself in an attempt to appeal to him. She finds an ex-wrestler & with some physical influencing gets him to train her & some of her co-workers to be her tag partners only to discover that they've been arranged to actually compete in a match against a group of luchadoras while having issues in training that range from extreme to comedic along with dealing with other issues at work, relationships in their personal lives, their own interactions with each other.

This was a french comedy film which WWE Studios supported & provided footage of superstars such as Eve Torres & The Miz & C.M. Punk to go along with the story but no actual WWE superstars appear live in the movie. The movie itself was simple & easy enough to follow having the over the top with the antics involving the women training & one girl's constant pursuit of one of the boxers at the training gym but still had it's serious moments when it came to addressing their personal issues. In the end, I was entertained & definitely would recommend for a viewing but keep in mind that this is a french film so make sure you have the english dubbed version.",1468368000,,1360,4.44

8672545,1,B00MIA0GCW,The words do not match the lips and some times the lips do not even move when they talk. The move is OK at best and in less  you want you children listen to the F word and S word it would be 18 and over. You will see a breast or two when the females are in the shower I have about 4000 movies and I would sell this one for a $1.00.,1416787200,,331,3.472972972972973

8672547,1,B00MIA0GCW,"As pro wrestling fans we're accustomed to a certain degree of disrespect. People who don't watch on a regular basis don't understand the appeal, and they always give you the ""You know it's fake, right?"" as if you were born on another planet or something. Worse, the movies geared towards wrestling die-hards have been atrocious for the most part. Thank Vince McMahon for that; not surprising given the moronic storylines he puts on WWE TV all too frequently. While we had our moment in the sun when Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler came out a few years ago, a brain dead flick like Ready to Rumble is what we usually get. And now we're taking one more body slam with Queens of the Ring, a film that's insultingly stupid even by wrestling standards.

Because this is a French film the comedy isn't exactly geared towards American audiences, but damn this is still pretty dumb. Worse, the dubbing was clearly an afterthought as none of the voices match and I'm convinced all of the women were voiced by the same two people...and maybe some of the guys, as well. Told in the madcap broad strokes that mark too many French comedies, the story centers on Rose (Marilou Berry), who is attempting to get into her estranged son's good graces by becoming a professional wrestler. She lost custody after a violent episode landed her in prison, and he hasn't quite forgiven her yet. So along with a trio of friends working at the supermarket, Rose hooks up with a famous pro wrestling trainer to learn the ropes, literally. Joining her on this Diva Talent Search are the bored housewife Colette (Nathalie Baye), the slutty redhead Jessica (Audrey Fleurot), and the crazy meat butcher Viviane (Corinne Masiero).  Their training, shown mostly in goofy montage, consists of absolutely nothing real pro wrestlers would go through. So don't expect to learn a few things about the real struggle to get into the squared circle.

But once the action gets into the ring the intensity and wrestling skill shown by the actresses is better than the rest of the movie would suggest. Unfortunately, these ladies are matched up against two large women known simply as ""The Mexicans"", and you'll quickly grow tired of all the jokes about tacos and burritos. For that matter, the racial humor here is pretty offensive, at least by American standards. That goes double for Jessica's pursuit of a hot black guy (""I've never had a black before."") she meets at the gym.

A WWE Studios co-production (an American remake is coming, too), appearances by superstars The Miz, CM Punk, and Eve Torres are touted but blink and you'll miss them. Chances are they didn't want to be too closely involved with a film this unfunny and juvenile. Yes, juvenile. Too juvenile for the studio that gave us such ""highbrow"" comedies as Knucklehead (the poster featuring Big Show in a damn diaper) and The Chaperone.

While watching Queens of the Ring I was struck by how unfair it is there are no good movies about becoming a professional wrestler. We have literally thousands of movies about athletes breaking into their chosen sport; we have the same number about actors looking for their big Hollywood break. Wrestling is called sports entertainment for a reason. It combines the best of both worlds, and someday a filmmaker will come along who will convincingly show how tough breaking into the business really is. Queens of the Ring is not that movie, it's about as enjoyable as a chair shot to the head.",1415664000,2,3457,4.803361344537815
