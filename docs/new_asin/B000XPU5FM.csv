8228969,2,B000XPU5FM,"This movie is a look at Fiona Richman's life story.  While there is a good amount of nudity, there is way more talk than action and little comedy.  If you like Fiona nude you might be happy otherwise pass on this movie.",1413763200,2,219,4.190476190476191
8228970,5,B000XPU5FM,"I saw this movie decades ago and recorded excerpts on VHS. Very glad to see that it is on DVD now. Most of the movie is just OK but the scenes in her publisher's office are off the chart for softcore (in my opinion). Every time Fiona has an appointment with her publisher, there is a guy in the background (with occasional closeups) checking women's measurements. He has them remove their top and then checks for firmness. I want that guy's job. He interviews 4 or 5 different women and they are all gorgeous. That is the primary reason I love this movie and had to update my format (DVD).",1388880000,3,589,4.363636363636363
