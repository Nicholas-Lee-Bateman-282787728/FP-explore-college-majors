4661859,5,B005DTGBN8,"The 411:
These movies are good if you love Christmas movies and if you are fan of Lifetime Movies. Maybe not in my top 20 Christmas movie list but definitely movies I would watch again.

In Christmas in Paradise, we meet two families celebrating the Christmas Holiday while taking a cruise into the Caribbean. One family is without a father and the other without a mother. The parental units are missing for different reasons; one has passed away and the other has abandoned the family.

Each family is having a difficult time and when they end up befriending each other, the families share a sense of healing and understanding. Eureka's Colin Ferguson and the beautiful Charlotte Ross from Glee are the struggling single parents and they both play their roles very subdued allowing the children to shine. Colin Ferguson spends most of his time making ""I am so ashamed of you"" and ""Please let me help you faces.""  The children actors are talented and I love all the hocky singing and prancing about. I even love the rebellious daughter who is doing anything to show how much she doesn't care and the precocious younger sister who seems to have all the answers. Very cute movie. I love happy endings.

Deck the Halls stars Gabrielle Carteris of 90210 fame and a new face for me who is complete eye candy, Steve Bacic.

This is about a widowed woman named Holly who moves back to assist her father's toy company with her 8 year old son, Ben.  As the CFO she is trying to wrangle the over spending by her father's favorite employee Nick. Nick has been hired to boost sales and with his swarm of midget friends and reindeer pets, Ben believes he has finally met Santa. After being set up by her son Ben who writes emails to her from a secret admirer, she and Nick get to know each other a little better. As her son gets closer to Nick, she reluctantly asks him to distance himself knowing that Nick will be leaving in December. When Ben's dog is hurt, Nick promises them everything will be OK. Is Nick Santa? Ummm...if so, he is the cutest Santa ever!

My only problem with the movie is that while Ben asks Santa for his father back, he is still trying to set up his mom. Umm...strange 8 year old.

This is an adorable movie about believing and miracles.",1323734400,4,2250,4.511056511056511
4661860,5,B005DTGBN8,"These movies are pretty good and the cast play their parts very well.  It was a bit hard to believe the boy in 'Deck The Halls' was only 8 when the part was clearly played by and older child.  Otherwise, I enjoyed both movies and would recommend them for any family viewing.",1322438400,7,274,4.25
4661861,5,B005DTGBN8,"These are both family oriented Christmas films.  The cable channels run them both every year at Christmas time.  They are both light-hearted films that are fun for every member of the family.  I bought them because I like to watch inspirational movies like these all through the year.  You can't beat the price and I don't believe anyone who loves Christmas would be disappointed by either film.  I whole-heartedly recommend both these films.  Both of my thumbs are up.  CHRISTMAS IN PARADISE is a story of two single-parents vacationing in the Caribbean with their children.  A divorced father with his two daughters and a widowed mother with her two boys.  The children connect and so do the parents, when all of a sudden the father's former wife shows up and wants to get her family back.  It all comes to a happy ending and the two families take off from the hotel together.  DECK THE HALLS, is an extremely touching fantasy.  A widowed mother moves with her adolescent son back to her home and goes to work as CFO for her father's toy company.  Her dad has hired a Christmas specialist named Nick to boost sales.  Turns out that Nick is really Santa Claus and the story has a very happy ending.  Both are wonderful family films.",1319414400,30,1233,4.617511520737327
4661862,5,B005DTGBN8,"Christmas in Paradise is a very good Christmas movie, it's not the typical ""Put up your Christmas tree and having snow falling kind of Christmas"" It's a very tropical one. Deck the halls is also a great movie.",1469577600,,209,4.526315789473684

4661864,3,B005DTGBN8,"Having experienced cold and white Christmases all of my life, I really wanted to see Christmas in Paradise. I was not disappointed. It is a loving story of two families who are hurting greatly at what is suppose to be a happy time of the year. The sunny, warm tropical climate is a balm to the Christmas feeling. The lack of more stars is that Deck the Halls misses the mark a great deal. It is a flawed Christmas story in many ways. The plot is simply not credible and the treatment of small people is morally questionable. They are made to look like fools. An ""A"" for Christmas in Paradise. A  ""D"" for Deck the Halls.",1454112000,2,619,4.2905982905982905

4661876,3,B005DTGBN8,"Christmas in Paradise has two families coming together on a Christmas Holiday vacation to a tropical country.  One is a widowed Mom with two sons and the other a man whose wife had run off with another man and left him with two daughters.  Just when they are on the verge of their romance the cheating mother returns thinking all is to be forgiven.  Aria Wallace was absolutely great as the youngest daughter.  A major flaw I felt was having the oldest daughter so self-absorbed, disrespectful and cruel at the beginning that her turn around was totally unbelievable.  The directer had her too dislikeable.
Deck The Halls was a cute, silly movie.  Entertaining, but it had a erratic feel to it.  The directing or editing, something did not give it a smooth feel.  The storyline has a crazy fun loving toy maker bringing in a outlandish character to help turn the business around.  Steve Bacic (secretly Santa) plays the goofy beach bum style character that brings about the change while helping the toymaker's grandson and loosing up his uptight daughter (as usual in a lifetime movie one of the love interests is a widow or widower) to love again with her childhood sweetheart.  Fun movie.",1417737600,,1190,4.760975609756097

8467488,4,B005DTGBN8,"To me, the real stars of this movie were the Three Kings, who worked some special magic to assist the troubled families in the movie. The film highlights how much more important these participants in the nativity story are in Puerto Rico and Latin America. It was an eye  opener, and very charming. In the present day celebration of Christmas in the US, these guys get the brush off. When there were 12 days of Christmas, they went from 12/15 to 1/6, with families gathering together for the whole time in the days of coaches and carriages, Many marriages in Colonial days took place on 1/6, before everyone returned home. Sweet film. Glad to be able to buy it because it doesn't air anymore.",1515196800,,692,4.580645161290323
