8236475,1,B00101JKJU,Unable to  play this DVD on a DVD player or on a computer.  Not satisfactory.,1412640000,,77,4.066666666666666
8236476,1,B00101JKJU,"The other two companion DVDs of Peterhof and Catherine's Palace are so good that it seems like a real shame that the only real viewing I received of this one was a downloaded two minutes on the travel store site. The first one had some coding problems, as did the replacement one that Amazon sent.  What a shame! I didn't have the heart to try again and just took the loss. Global Treasures has some of the best photography going, and it shows on the videos of the palaces.  There isn't enough on this beautiful city -- travel videographers attention!  Much more is needed on the Venice of the North!",1306281600,2,600,4.4363636363636365
8236477,3,B00101JKJU,"For me, in my preparation for a trip to St. Petersburg, the Global Treasures DVD for that city was somewhat enjoyable to watch.  However, you should be aware of the following:

1.  The DVD is only ten minutes long (and the first minute is taken up by Global Treasures marketing).
2.  It would not play on our DVD players or on my iMac (that will play commercial DVDs).  However, I was able to convert the DVD file to another format and import it as a ""TV Show"" into iTunes and then it played (with sound) on my computer.
3.  The photography was somewhat fuzzy.  Perhaps that was the result of the conversion process (I just don't know) -- normally, photo or movie images are very sharp on my new iMac screen.

Other DVDs that deal with St. Petersburg are available from Amazon.com and the ones that I have seen are all superior to this one.",1299196800,4,840,4.374193548387097
