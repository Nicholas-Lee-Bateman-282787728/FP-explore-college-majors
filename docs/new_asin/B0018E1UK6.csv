3417305,5,B0018E1UK6,"Why has there not been a release for Season 2 for Life Goes On??  I agree with a previous poster; with all the garbage out there on DVDs, we can not get something that actually taught lessons in life and how to respect others?

Please release this and subsequent seasons!",1249344000,7,271,4.4
3417306,5,B0018E1UK6,I purchased the first season as soon as it came out on video. I don't understand why these stupid shows that didn't even last one season are out on DVD already and I have been waiting almost 3 years for the second season of Life goes On to come out. Can someone explain this one for me?!? It figures that my all time favorite show takes forever while MTV shows get priority. PLEASE COME OUT WITH THE SECOND SEASON!!! Thank you!,1232582400,29,427,4.283950617283951
3417307,4,B0018E1UK6,I bought this from Amazon and sure enough it came quickly in the mail and plays great! The DVD's are crisp and clear and the bonus features are cool. The discs have nice photos on them. My family hopes that more Life Goes On DVD sets will be released.,1230076800,3,251,4.142857142857143
3417308,5,B0018E1UK6,"I can't wait til season 2 (and the rest of the seasons) of Life Goes On is released on DVD, and I'm crossing my fingers that it will be!  I looked forward to Sunday evenings all week so I could watch my favorite show.",1226188800,3,217,3.9318181818181817
3417309,5,B0018E1UK6,"It's baffling that subsequent seasons of this show haven't been released on DVD yet, compared to the drek that is being cranked out daily.  It was a must-see on Sunday nights, even at its corniest, and surely it would find a new audience today if it were available for home viewing.  If it were properly cross-promoted with other programs even people who aren't currently aware of it could be persuaded to take a chance and get into the saga of Becca, Corky et al.",1226188800,6,464,4.511904761904762
3417310,5,B0018E1UK6,Life Goes On is a wonderful show about family & how they stay together. I can't wait for the whole show to come out on DVD soon. I have season 1. Maybe they will come out with like a Box Set of all the shows that would be something great I think . What do you think with alot of bonus stuff on them about the cast & photos & stuff. I just love Life Go's On :),1211587200,12,359,3.6153846153846154
3417311,5,B0018E1UK6,I Hope that this season of life goes on to be released on dvd. This was such a good show when it aired on ABC years ago. I'll buy it in a hurry when it is released.,1210896000,13,164,3.4594594594594597
8269634,5,B0018E1UK6,I agree with everybody else if they're going to put the first season of life goes on out DVD please put the rest out I love that show it was one of my favorites growing up also I would love to have the rest on DVD.,1522713600,,214,3.6739130434782608

8269637,5,B0018E1UK6,"PLEASE, I beg you to produce the life goes on sessons 2,3,and 4. Growing up that was one of my favorite shows ever!!! I would love to be able to see it all again. It is a wonderful series with wonderful family values. I have season one. There are so many shows from the past that have been reproduced and sold but not life goes on . I don't understand that. Pretty please with a cherry on top make seasons 2,3,and 4.  If you do you will make many people so happy and you would make money too cause people would buy it.  Thankyou.",1351555200,7,529,4.076923076923077

8269639,5,B0018E1UK6,"My family and I have been waiting for years to get the 2nd, 3rd and 4th season of Life goes On. Our daughter is Down Syndrome and asks all the time when the rest of the series will be coming out so that we can buy them. The series was one of the best family programs during the time it ran. It would be refreshing if todays so called family friendly tv programs went back to true family values like what was portayed in this series. Come on powers that be, who has the authority to make this happen, PLEASE make it happen. There is so much junk that has been released, can't those of us who want something worth watching have our dreams come true? Thanks for letting me state my opinion.",1323648000,5,687,4.172932330827067

8269641,5,B0018E1UK6,"Please come out with the rest of the seasons for Life Goes On.  It was my favorite show, & when season 1 was released I was at Best Buy to pick it up!  If its a show thats in demand, release it!!  So many shows that were only on for a seaon or 2 get put on DVD, but not something that was on for a few years & such a popular show?!?  It makes NO sense!!",1286496000,7,353,3.5454545454545454
8269642,5,B0018E1UK6,I don't know how much longer we will have to wait until ALL of the seasons of Life Goes On is released on DVD for purchase!  What can we do to let those who are holding back on this release know what we want?!,1274140800,2,209,3.75
