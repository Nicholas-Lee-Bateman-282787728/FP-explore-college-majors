8377792,3,B002QH2RMO,"I am not a Spanish speaker but I saw this movie on a Spanish language station and was quite entertained by it even though I could understand very little of the dialogue... It apparently is a farcical romp involving a band of sexy revolutionary women who walk around wearing as little as possible and using their charms as weapons to defeat the plans of a group of three randy old counter-revolutionaries, and they steal their weapons after seducing them. Then all hell breaks loose... A bit of spicy fun if you like to laugh and look at some sexy women misbehaving and driving men crazy!",1351382400,,587,4.6
