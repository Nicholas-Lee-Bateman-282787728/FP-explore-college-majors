4982818,3,B006C0PPO8,"Rebecca Hall (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") is Florence Cathcart, an author and supernatural hoax debunker in early 20th century England. One day a teacher named Robert Malory (Dominic West) arrives, asking for her help. The students at his boarding school are all shocked at the mysterious death of a boy, believing that the strange incident has something to do with the ghost sightings in the school's premises.

Florence is welcomed by a quiet housekeeper Maud (Imelda Staunton), who happens to be an admirer of Florence's book. Florence's scientific investigation takes an unexpected turn, however, leading her to the secrets hidden deep in the old school building.

The supernatural thriller's story is set in 1921, only a few years after World War I ended.  Directed by Nick Murphy, ""The Awakening"" has a unique heroine, intelligent and strong-minded Florence Cathcart, who reminds us of Harry Houdini and his anti-spiritualist campaign. But is she secretly looking for evidences that prove the existence of afterlife?

Unfortunately the film fails to offer a story this interesting protagonist really needs. Her psychological transformation is abrupt and doesn't convince (why doesn't she just leave anyway?); her romantic relationship is introduced too suddenly; and the truths that are revealed in the climax are simply incredible. About 40 minutes in, the film virtually stops telling us a story until the wrap-up that tries too hard to be clever.

With powerhouse performances from Rebecca Hall and Imelda Staunton, as well as competent photography and production designs, ""The Awakening"" manages to entertain, and some scenes are genuinely creepy. If you are looking for more coherent story, this is not your film. ""The Awakening"" is a so-so UK horror you may enjoy as long as you ignore the story that goes out of control towards the ending.",1356393600,2,1852,5.285714285714286
4982819,3,B006C0PPO8,"""You can't hurt what doesn't exist."" In England after WWI the country is overwhelmed by grief. A boarding school has begun to experience ghostly visions of dead children. A woman named Florence (Hall) is hired to come in and expose the hoax and put everyone's mind at rest. Little by little she begins to question herself. I have to say that this movie is very hard to review. It started off pretty slow then got more interesting then slowed down, then got scary, then slowed down, then had a great twist. The movie itself is OK but it was so inconsistent that I found it hard to pay attention to the entire time. After the ""Woman In Black"" movies like this have been taken to a new level and this would have been better if it came out before that one. The horror is very psychological and really more ""Shining"" like then anything. Overall, a movie worth seeing but be prepared for slow moments. I give it a C+.",1355702400,2,911,4.396449704142012
4982820,3,B006C0PPO8,"""The Awakening"" is a by-the-books ghost story, one which ticks all the requirements of the genre: a spooky atmosphere, a damaged heroine, tricky camera-work, and a last act twist. Though some plot-points may not hold up under close scrutiny, it does its job as watchable entertainment for the duration of its run time, carried by the strength of its lead actress and its moody, haunting ambience.

An effective and sympathetic Rebecca Hall is Florence Cathcart, a professional ghost-hunter in 1920s England who exposes hoaxes and fraudulent con-artists seeking to capitalize on people's grief in the post-war environment. Having found some degree of notoriety with her latest book debunking spiritualism, she's hired by a boy's boarding school to investigate some bizarre goings-on. Once a private house, Rookford School is now filled with young school pupils, many of whom swear to have seen the ghost of a young boy with a distorted face in the upper corridors. The situation has reached crisis-level with the death of a pupil, presumably frightened to death after seeing the ghost during a trip to the latrine at night. Now the rest of the students are terrified, and parents are arriving en-masse to whisk them away.

Assisted by teacher Robert Mallory and school matron Maud, Florence begins to investigate matters, only to find that - you guessed it - all her assumptions about the afterlife and the spirit world are called into question.

Rebecca Hall grounds the story with her portrayal of a modern woman in a period film, using her intellect, cunning, and a range of photographic equipment to assess the situation and act accordingly. For the first half-hour it's an appealing depiction of a proactive, educated and well-respected heroine existing at a time when a woman wouldn't be expected to be any of these things - but unfortunately the characterization begins to go off-the-rails as the film goes on, with plenty of inexplicable behavior (Florence's reaction at catching the ghost on film is to immediately have sex with the guy standing next to her. I never knew ghost-hunting was such a turn-on) and the inclusion of an utterly pointless attempted rape scene. What is it with films believing that throwing in a gratuitous rapist that leaves their female protagonists bloody, disheveled and terrified somehow equals a rewarding subplot?

Still, the actress is compelling enough to steer through the story's murky waters and her character's inconsistencies, and she's backed up nicely by solid supporting actors. The tiny cast is composed mainly of Dominic West as a teacher/war veteran/love interest (though don't ask me where his character's stutter went after the first act) and Imelda Staunton as the school nurse, both of whom have their own dark secrets.

Yet plot-wise, there are some things that just don't add up. Someone gets locked in a bedroom at a crucial point for no clear reason. A character shows concern for another character that is unnecessary in retrospect. The groundskeeper subplot is completely superfluous. And Florence's backstory on her lover that died in the war doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything. The resolution is revealed in a lightning-quick montage that really could have used some better pacing for the audience to better absorb all the information, and it ends on an ambiguous note that I'm not really sure was *meant* to be that ambiguous.

Make no mistake, the real draw-card of ""The Awakening"" is the acting and the cinematography. The entire film drips with an eerie formidability all throughout the large, cold rooms of the boarding house and its wooded grounds.  It's hard not to be drawn into its visual style, and the director makes good use of those familiar ""spooky icons"", whether they be doll-houses, creepy children, balls rolling down stairs, fuzzy photographs, or disturbing-looking toys that no child in their right mind would ever want to touch let alone play with. It's an immensely evocative film.

But I can't really bring myself to give ""The Awakening"" more than three stars. Though the performances are strong and the build-up suspenseful, the story and characters are too convoluted and/or contrived to make this an absolute must-see. If you're in the mood for a pleasantly spooky film on a dark and stormy night, you could do worse than this.",1349827200,9,4327,5.0930888575458395

4982822,5,B006C0PPO8,"This creepy gothic thriller/horror is set in old England, 1921. This production is your typical British Haunted House Movie, starring Rebecca Hall who plays Florence Cathcart. Florence is hired to investigate a haunted boarding school, who has her doubts at first that ghosts are haunting the school. However, as the investigation continues, so do the eerie occurences around the school. The ghost hunter then becomes convinced that spirits of the dead are angry as the terror begins. Acting Performance of Rebecca Hall is perfect for this chilling movie, along with England as the spooky setting.

4982823,5,B006C0PPO8,"Rebecca Hall stars as Florence Cathcart an educated woman who debunks spiritualists. The movie opens with a seance  in 1921 London.  Our heroine springs into action.

She is then requested to come to an orphanage where a ghost of a boy has been spotted and photographed. She dismisses the ghostly images, and accepts the task.
Florence is an independent and educated woman, who smokes. She reminded me of Anne Hathaway in this role. As her investigation proceeds, Florence begins to doubt her skepticism/atheism.

Interesting film with a twist that has clues. Good use of sound. Enjoyable. 4 1/2 stars.

4982826,5,B006C0PPO8,"Loosely in the same vein as The Others (2001), this film is a period horror/thriller following a brilliant but vulnerable woman in a situation that challenges everything that she knows and believes. I absolutely adore this film. I love this sort of tension-based thriller/horror style that relies more on subtle terrors than outright jump scares, often because they're genuinely scarier and because the scares feel entirely earned.

The acting in this film is superb, and the characters are all complex and well-motivated. Hall gives a stellar performance as a woman who continuously walks the line between confident and utterly vulnerable, ready to break at any moment. This film has definitely made my list of favourite films, and is near the top of my horror/thriller film list. I definitely recommend it.",1505865600,,808,5.2153846153846155

4982828,5,B006C0PPO8,"Superb cinematography, gorgeous settings, solid acting by Rebecca Hall and Dominic West. An interesting story that has multiple twists and turns. Sure, all of the twists and turns have been done in different movies, but the way they were used in the Awakening gave them a fresh twist. NOT a horror movie, so don't watch if you're expecting that. It's dark and suspenseful atmosphere is perfect for 1921 England. All in all, an enjoyable movie that keeps you guessing.

A lot of the negative reviews I've seen seem to be based on the fact that the writer missed an important detail or two in the movie, and was then confused later in the film. This is definitely a movie you want to watch closely and pay attention to all of the little things. The other critique I've seen is that there's nothing in the story that foreshadows some or all of the twists, therefore the twists seem to come out of nowhere. If you're paying close attention the foreshadowing is there. There are plenty of small clues along the way. It's a subtle movie, so the clues that foreshadow the twists are subtle, and not so blatant that you know where the movie is going and the twists are not twists at all.",1498867200,,1179,4.535211267605634

4982849,4,B006C0PPO8,"This is a film worth the watch. It has a little bit for almost everyone: a little fright, a mystery to solve, some romance, and solid performances. (I wish they would have cast someone for the school mistress that wasn't so identifiable with movies like the Harry Potter series. It was distracting.) The film also has a good pace, a beautiful backdrop, and a satisfying --  if not a little bit convoluted -- end. (The resolution and denouement needed some tightening, but I would suspect that the screenwriters didn't spend enough time hashing it out, and the film deserved that.) Another element that I appreciated was the lack of invective/cursing.  I am bored with films filled with cursing and people saying J*^% Ch$*# every other sentence. Not all of us speak that way.  So, in the end, the only people who probably will not like this film are those who must have constant action to be satisfied:car chases, fight scenes on top of trains, and men hanging from helicopters.  Furthermore, be warned: It does have some brief nudity that I do not think was necessary, but they wanted their ""R"" rating -- which I think will hurt this film more than help it. So too, I wish the authors had avoided using a title that is hooked with an American classic short story by Kate Chopin. (There are enough titles out there that I felt that the writers could have come up with another title that actually would have worked just as well.) Finally, the hair stylist needed to do something with Rebecca Hall's hair for pity sake! Put in some extensions, comb it, but do something with it! The men had better hair than she did, and she would have been much more interesting to look at if her hair hadn't been such a mess for most of the film.",1470528000,,1728,4.546623794212219

4982855,4,B006C0PPO8,"This is a British take on the classic ghost story, and it's an interesting viewing experience given the anniversaries of World War I that are occurring. Set in 1921, the period piece elegantly captures what it is like for an entire society to live haunted, with the grieved survivors perpetually carrying the millions of dead with them even as they struggle to move on with the business of living. The opening quotes and seance scene pull the viewer in and set the right tone and atmosphere. The setting of the boys' school in a large, historic manor house is also perfect for setting up the ghost story and potential haunting. The convoluted twists in the last 20 minutes are what limit this to a 4-star review, as the sudden intrusion of connections to a backstory before the war don't quite add up, and a Sixth-Sense-style twist is clumsily handled. Still, it's a lovely way to shiver through an evening, and it's compelling enough you might even find you're self hitting the replay option to make sure you got it all after the end.",1465603200,,1035,4.66120218579235

4982865,5,B006C0PPO8,"I have now watched this twice and liked it even better the second time, which means it has met the test.  This is an atmospheric ghost film, based around a melancholy paranormal skeptic, a Cambridge-educated scientist who debunks charlatan spiritualists in the aftermath of WWI.  I think it is a masterpiece of point counterpoint as she makes a journey that turns out to be far more personal than one would assume at the beginning.

Florence is a kind of celebrity debunker, dramatically uncovering frauds and having written a best seller about it.  SHe is openly atheist and uses state-of-the art technology to record what is happening.  A man, Robert, approaches her and she eventually agrees to investigate a school ghost.  He is a WWI veteran, who embodies the horror of the recent past, with death in the trenches  and the the great influenza epidemic.  The atmospherics are pitch perfect, sad and full of inner conflict and traumatic memory.

Florence is an extraordinary individual, a woman activist who operates in a time when men don't believe that anyone but men can be competent and intelligent.  She quickly solves a mystery and, just when people think she will depart in triumph, she finds more that she wants to investigate.  As her character emerges, the story deepens once she admits that she is desperately struggling against fear, which she hates to admit.

The other characters are also exceptional.  There is a lonely boy, Tom, who with Maud befriends her when the boys in the school go home for vacation.  Florence begins to see that there is more there than she has known, and it is directly connecting to her buried memories because her past is a mystery even to her.  Robert, a teacher of history, is burdened with his own demons, a way to connect with Florence.  The games keeper is also a Victorian character, suppressed and watching while envious of Robert.

I will not reveal happens.  There are many surprises and false pistes, the audience is uncertain what is real and what is not.  Of course, this can be banally silly, but in this film it fits perfectly and can be watched more than once for extra depth.  For example, there is a scene with a doll house, which Florence scrutinizes, shockingly finding herself simulated within it.  The surprises are very believable, with all sorts of double meanings and revelations, indeed murderous actions.

This is a great film experience.  It tilts reality and you have so many details that you will want to watch it again to figure it out.  That is a great sign of success.  Recommended with enthusiasm.",1456358400,,2576,4.82648401826484

4982873,5,B006C0PPO8,"For the last several years, a core group of my friends and I have gotten together to binge watch horror movies. Why? No idea. Call it the imp of the perverse or a harkening back to our teens, but basically, we just get a charge scaring ourselves silly. Few movies these days actually pull it off. Can't stand splatter-gore fests. And I've had it with the dreary, now cliche, evil wins while everyone you like dies endings. I want a movie that is atmospheric and moody, where the tension builds and builds, all the while fraying your nerves and setting your mind to wander over the possibilities. The Awakening blew me and my friends away.

It's a story about a post WW1 ghost chaser. Who knew there were any? But, Ms. Cathcart pulls it off. She's a skeptic, but a brainy one who can't stand to see poor, bereaved people taken advantage of by money-grubbing charlatans. She can't stand it because she is, herself, in mourning. Fast forward to the arrival of Robert who claims that for once, there might just be a real ghost haunting a boy's school out in the middle of the English countryside. Ms. Cathcart reluctantly reports for duty, and finds herself up against something terrifying and real, and somehow familiar.

It's a wickedly cool story with an extraordinary twist at the end. And, best of all, it all makes sense. The logic of the story never falters. Each character is well drawn, with his or her own motives and backstory. But the storytelling is beyond superb. It's that ""Hammer film"" creepy that we love. The movie respects the people watching it and expects you to linger on certain clues even after having the living crap scared out of you. SPOILER ALERT: the scene out in the woods with the would be rapist? HOLY CRAP. I went through a box of Depends on that one scene.

The movie is moody and shot incredibly well. Images linger in your mind's eye forever.

However, the Awakening has issues with plot and focus. It is somewhere caught between a detective story, a ghost story, and a drama. Unfortunately, the detective bits feel rushed without much exposition. As a drama the film also suffers, the main character crosses the line from assertive to plain rude and is not sympathetic until the end. However, the acting is fine, the film looks nice, and is a good view for fans of ghost stories.",1444262400,,585,4.376146788990826

4982881,3,B006C0PPO8,"The Awakening stars Rebecca Hall as Florence Cathcart, an author and ghost-hunter who works with the London police during the 1920s to expose phony spiritualist scams.  She is approached by Robert Malory, a teacher at a boarding school to investigate the death of a young student who died after supposedly seeing a ghost.  Florence travels to the remote school in the country, a foreboding structure that once was a private home.  When one of the students tries to scare her off Florence discovers the boys death was a horrible prank gone wrong and that he died of an asthma attack, not of fright.

But as she prepares to leave the school, the real supernatural activity begins.  The school nearly empties for the holidays except for Malory, Maud the housekeeper, the groundskeeper, and Tom, a boy whose parents are in India.  Florence begins to experience terrifying visions of a man pointing a shotgun at her.  She finds a dollhouse-sized model of the school in an otherwise empty room.  As she peers inside its windows she sees tiny dolls, arranged in the positions of events that recently happened, including one in which it shows a woman peering into a dollhousejust as she is doing at that very moment.  The events grow more terrifying as Florence tries to come to grips with her own fears that she has long avoided including the death of her lover during World War I.

The Awakening came and went from theaters last summer without making a ripple and its easy to tell why.  This is a traditional, gothic style horror film that moves to slowly for a lot of peoples tastes.  It conjures up images of the work of gothic romanticists with its shuddered rooms, secret panels, and dark, hidden secrets.  But this sort of romantic gothic film is going to be a tough sell for modern audiences.  While Director Nick Murphy does an admirable job of building atmosphere in the bleak schoolhouse, there isn't enough freak-you-out scary moments.  Its rated R but thats a very soft R and has more to do about a couple of brief nude scenes than any terrifying content.

You don't want to give away spoilers but the film falls back on a plot device that has been overly used in recent years and if you pay attention closely, and watch who is talking to whom, you likely won't have a difficult time connecting the dots.  Most disappointing though is a purposely, cop-out ambiguous ending that screams of a Director trying too cute.

The performances are what keep the film above average.  Hall is outstanding as the seemingly self-assured Florence who soon falls apart with her own insecurities.  Dominic West is Malory and West is always watchable bringing class and dignity to every role he plays.  The Awakening isn't for everyone but if you're looking for an atmospheric chiller rather than the typical special effects driven horror, then it is worth a rent at least.",1438387200,,2861,4.762677484787019

4982892,3,B006C0PPO8,"I screened this last night after a friend told me it was at least, worth a look,
and I agree with most of the reviews here: good, but not great, historical
ghost/suspense/mystery tale inspired by countless others and countless
fictional and historical period sources.

Story a bit convoluted, hackneyed, some of it even a trifle baffling at first glance (or muddled), but what it lacks
in plot it makes up for to some degree with atmosphere, dread, some genuinely
scary moments, and a refreshing lack of gore and splatter that a film like this
doesn't need, anyway.  The cast are, I believe, uniformly excellent, the film looks
great, sounds great, sets and locations fantastic, very impressive as an
overall production.  I definitely think it's quite unfair to say this film is dreadful,
but ok, it's not a 5 star masterpiece, either.  The background of the WW I UK
""lost"" generation and all the underpinnings of the setting and storyline, back-stories
of various characters, almost proved much more fascinating (and ""real life"" horrifying) than
any ""ghost"" tale and that's ok, not a bad thing at all since it makes for a grim
and scarifying backdrop to the entire yarn.

Not a great film, but as a horror nut I didn't at all feel like I utterly wasted my
95 minutes.  I've seen much much worse and especially lately that ""passes""
for horror or suspense.....I know a lot of people love the SAW franchise but
to me, it's not scary, not horror, not supernatural horror in any case, and
The Awakening, at least, comes closer in spirit at least, to the classic
supernatural fiction I treasure most (and films).  And at least it does it
with some panache and intelligence.

I keep thinking of the 1981 film of Peter Straub's Ghost Story and what a terribly flawed
film (though with some great moments and cast) that was (at best, really kind of a bastardized mess, to be
quite blunt).  I wouldn't mind seeing this team tackle a really faithful
and no holds-barred remake of Ghost Story!!  That might be a project even more
worth doing, if they could only get the rights to do it.  Of course that tale is set
in America but still!  I compare this to that film because what would THAT
been minus the great Alice Krige?  Junk!  And so would this probably, minus
the clearly gifted Rebecca Hall (and the rest of a solid ensemble cast).

C'mon guys, I just suffered through 1980's ROADIE, one of the worst bombs
ever perpetrated on the public, and you call The Awakening a terrible film!??
Nah.  Granted, it ain't Lawrence of Arabia, not even The Shining, but it's not awful!
I also thought Rebecca Hall was outstanding in her role and brought something
special to this that might otherwise have been very much absent.  It's called talent.
This film's parts are greater than its sum, which I suppose is the main issue here,
otherwise I would recommend giving it at least a shot.  DVD extras not voluminous
but informative and include deleted scenes and the director's cogent commentary on same.",1423008000,,2985,4.707692307692308

This small cast, well chosen location and superb direction by Nick Murphy (previously known for TV series' and documentaries) makes for a bleak & spooky atmosphere. There are plenty of `jump' moments and the masterfully managed tension just keeps building throughout the film. The enigmatic ending rounds the whole experience off very nicely and you can't help being reminded of the superb ` The Others'.

When handsome Robert comes to her with tales of a boys' boarding school that is plagued with visions of a ghost child, she comes along to figure out the culprit. Once there, she discovers that there is a whole lot more to the story than just a simple trickster or even just a simple ghost.

A slow burner with some legitimately creepy moments and twists (many of them to do with a doll's house), this film falls flat in a few key ways. With tighter editing and a sharper script, the story would've been as powerful as its strongest reveals, but there are a few too many lags in the plot.

Most notably is the character of Robert, who is barely a real person and serves no good purpose other than to clear up a few loose ends (and provide a suggestion of a possible romantic subplot). Because he lacks anything resembling a personality, the film deflates when he's on screen, especially when the movie is trying to convince us that he and Florence seem to have some kind of complicated relationship, although that's a pretty big logical leap to make considering how long they've known each other.

Include a pretty pompous soundtrack and a cliched caretaker character (I forget the surly, grizzly man's name, but I think it might have been Mr. McGuffin), and you've got a movie with a decent story, some artful atmospherics, and a handful of cleverly executed spooks, but a lot of unoriginal and distracting padding that drags it down to average ghost story territory.",1409788800,,1539,4.713754646840148

Still, it's genuinely spooky for quite a while, with creepy art direction and very good performances from Hall and the others. We had goosebumps. Unfortunately, like a lot of contemporary movies  the writing holds it back. The plot gets confused and confusing, with some loose characters and stray plot points that never fit into the main story.

My imagination is too big for my own good, so I can manage to creep myself out enough without outside help.  I tend to avoid scary films like the plague, but one of my favorite young actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) was in it and I felt like I needed to support some of his earlier works.

Even though I originally watched for Isaac, the story completely sucked me in.  Wonderful actors like Imelda Staunton never fails to impress and leading lady Rebecca Hall played a very strong woman with repressed memories that have guided her life in more ways than she realizes.

While there are some scary images, what made this nice for me to watch was that there was a story to tell, and a very touching one that actually made me teary at the end.  It wasn't meant to just scare, but to move the character forward by looking to the past.

4982927,4,B006C0PPO8,"Though marketed as a standard horror film, the fact that this piece attracted actors with as much prestige as Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, and Rebecca Hall should be a clue that THE AWAKENING is not an ordinary ghost film, but something very special and moving. Set in 1921, the story involves a famous ghost-debunker (Hall) who is brought to a former country estate re-purposed as a boy's school to find how a little asthmatic student was frightened to death. The film really isn't very frightening, which is its worst flaw but perhaps still central to its aesthetic: it's structured less as a horror work and more as a mood and a character piece. The house (a combination of several different Scottish houses filmed from different angles) is itself a major character, and is gorgeously photographed. Although she plays a character who could not have existed in 1921 as she is depicted (the gender roles of the era are flouted too much here), Rebecca Hall brings a dose of good common sense and humor to her part; Dominic West is perfectly cast as her romantic interest, a Latin teacher recovering from wounds from the Great War.

4982931,5,B006C0PPO8,"I absolutely, thoroughly, and completely love this movie. It took me about six or seven viewings to be able to say that. As an American, it helped me (a lot!) to finally run it with the subtitles turned on to catch all the snippets of English-accented dialog that I missed the first few times around.

Rebecca Hall is perfectly cast as the spiritual medium- (read: con artist-) debunker who takes pity on the frightened children who think they've seen a ghost at a remote boys' boarding school. I didn't recognize the fine English/Irish actor Dominic West at first because I'd only seen him play an American in ""The Forgotten""; his accent in that movie sounded so natural to me as to seem native. Here he plays a history master who's seen a little too much of war's fickle cruelty. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with Shaun Dooley a stand-out as a brutishly stern teacher with a hacking cough and a guilty conscience. Ever-present, lurking in the background, is the true horror of that age, World War I.

But it's the young actor Isaac Hempstead Wright whom you'll remember above all the others, he of the haunted and haunting eyes. He almost made me believe in ghosts.

There are a few moments that will make you jump in your seat, but this is not a gore-fest. The overall tone is somber, some of the action horrifying in its cruelty, but it's the psychological violence visited on the characters themselves that forms the core of the suspense of the film. In the end, all of the main characters have changed, some heartbreakingly so.

I have to just mention here that I loved the device of the doll house.

This is a film that will leave you with questions. If you're willing to play along, suspend disbelief, and take it at face value, you'll enjoy it. There are a couple of extras, interviews with the film's director/co-writer Nick Murphy, that are fun and enlightening.

If you like eerily creepy haunted-house flicks on the order of ""The [original] Haunting,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Others,"" ""Haunted,"" ""The [original] Uninvited,"" and ""The Orphanage"" you should like this one. If you can handle plot ambiguity no more tedious than that in the aforementioned films, you should  be able to handle this one.

4982932,3,B006C0PPO8,"The film opens with the statement that thanks to influenza and war, there were millions dead in in Great Briton in the early 20th Century.  Then logic is tricked into leaving the room and they follow  up with ""This is evidence of ghosts""

No, it isn't.

Anyway, it doesn't have to make sense because it never becomes a plot point.

So the female lead is a 20th Century ghostbuster, using equipment they could have created at the time but probably didn't.  She takes great pleasure in exposing hoaxes, then gets all bummed out when ghosts turn out not to be real.

She is manipulated into going to a boys boarding school where she is greeted by Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter.  OK, just the actress who played her.  She is told there is a ghost boy roaming the halls and maybe killing the boys.  And by killing the boys, I mean a single asthmatic boy died when he was trapped outside all night,  So, you know.  Ghosts.

Anyway, she does debunk this but then sees signs of paranormal activity.  Weird things like a broken glass and a pool ball on the floor.

The story begins to make sense for awhile and you can follow it.  NIce little twist that they manage to screw up with a lonely boy who lives at the school.  A story line that never gets developed about a ginger boy getting bullied.  One dude who looks familar but wasn't in anything I have ever seen has a mysterious wound on his leg.  He is naked in the scene so there might have been more info that I just missed.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.

Here's the kicker.  I really can't figure out how it ends.  So, SPOILER ALERT

She is poisoned.  But did she live or die?  Nothing gives it away since people can randomly see ghosts in this thing.",1387238400,,1728,4.321875

4982934,3,B006C0PPO8,"The Awakening is a film starring Rebecca Hall as Florence Cathcart, a woman that can debunk any supernatural myth but can do nothing about her own haunted past. When Florence is called to a boarding school where ghost sightings are beginning to scare the students, she realizes this haunting is no hoax and proves only that the past- no matter how deeply buried- is never far.  Set in 1921 Britain the mood of the movie is as dark as that of the times. Don't expect edge of your seat thrills- there are not any. This ghost story would be better billed as suspense/ drama then a horror/thriller, as I -again & again- found myself feeling more sympathy then fear.

4982943,3,B006C0PPO8,"The time is 1921 and Florence Cathcart is a Cambridge-educated woman who spends her time debunking the spiritualism of the day--seances, ghost sightings, etc. She believes in science and facts and nothing else. She's even written a popular book about the subject. Her celebrity in demystifying what seems supernatural inspires a headmaster from Cumbria to recruit her. His boys' school is supposedly haunted by the ghost of a child murdered in the house before it became a school. The specter of a dead child has been terrifying the boys. One boy has died under the sort of mysterious circumstances that has frightened everybody. The school is about to have a holiday and the staff are worried the children won't come back.

Florence reluctantly agrees to go to the school. She sets up her scientific equipment to find out what's going on. She soon uncovers the entirely mundane explanation for the child's death but some other unexplained things happen and she can't leave just yet. So she stays during the break to investigate further. A few school people remain with her.

The movie delivers the typical chills for this kind of haunted house movie--creaky doors, glimpses of the specter just barely in frame, silent and slow exploration of the house in the dark, spooky toys, etc., much like The Woman in Black and The Others. I love this kind of horror. Even though I've seen most all the tricks before they still work on a visceral level.

The overall story is interesting enough to keep me guessing at the solution or trying to anticipate twists, which I was not able to do. The performances also kept me engaged. Florence's smug know-it-all character is soon led away from her biases and becomes more vulnerable and relate-able. The ending is a little bit playful, like Inception's ending, but it didn't make me groan like Inception did.

All in all, this movie is a solid B haunted house thriller that I would recommend.

Parental advisory--in addition to the overall tension and menace of a horror film, there's also a discreet sex scene, some nudity from both sexes, some human-on-human violence with bloody wounds. Also, there's some boarding school discipline (a cane to the hand and to the backside).",1380499200,,2213,4.906417112299465
4982944,4,B006C0PPO8,"I found this to be a very atmospheric movie that does a lot with only a little. There are no wild special effects, or wild scenes of gore, or blood soaked monsters running at the camera. Instead, The Awakening instills a sense of foreboding by mysterious footsteps, giggles, figures that are always just out of reach so we can't tell who they really are, characters that say one thing then do another and plenty of misdirection. And it keeps building all the way through. Even when the prankster is found, events keep happening. The more Florence seems to deny and debunk the events the more frequent and ghostly they become.

For those who liked The Others like I did, this is a fun movie. It has depth and scope. It makes you think and wonder. It shows that you can make a fun and atmospheric movie without going over the top with special effects and gore. There are lots of twists and turns in this one and the plot keeps getting deeper as we go along. When we get to the end we don't just learn about what's been making all the noises, we learn about several of the characters, how they're connected and how Florence is related to it all. It's an ending that fits very well with the story, one that doesn't feel cheap or contrived.

Not a perfect movie, but so much better than others in this genre.",1380067200,2,1303,4.402489626556017
4982945,4,B006C0PPO8,"In horror these days you have the bad, the okay, the good and the great, but none of them do much of anything different since most plots have been played out. So most horror movies based on ghosts feel redundant and rightly so. The only choice that fans have of this genre of horror is to expect a movie to have a different mood, and good production, with depth, good script writing and good acting. So we so we at least feel like we have watched something different, when we really haven't.

The Awakening is such a movie, it's nothing innovative or original, but it stands well against the other measures. If you love a good ghost movie then you will like this movie. It is well acted, written and the mood and scenes are what you would expect from a period horror movie.

I place this movie in between the good and the great, it's that good, and worth the watch. It's difficult for any horror movie to be great, but The Awakening comes close to great.",1379116800,7,954,4.353932584269663

4982959,4,B006C0PPO8,"Just after World War I ended, England as a country was ravaged by the effects of it both structurally in the need for rebuilding the cities and emotionally when it came to the panic and despair that still plagued the people who were both in the war and those who were victims of it. The year is 1921, Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall, ""Iron Man 3"")  goes around to various cities and buildings where residents claim to have hauntings and through various methods she disproves these ""hauntings"".

After a fairly well done opening sequence featuring some sort of seance summoning the ghost of a child, which turns out to be a major hoax. A man comes to her door and summons her to take care of another haunting so Florence goes to a boarding school in the town of Rookford. Here she is told about a ghost that scares the children of the school, some to death, she learns a certain someone who has died may be this ghost causing the problems. While attempting to show this as a hoax, things begin happening that make her question if this is actually a real ghost.

""The Awakening"" has a pretty typical story, the England setting and locations are shown in a beautiful way but with some washed out and bleak look to it (capturing the time period well). The set up to the arrival at the school is done well enough, Hall does a good job as Florence as does the rest of the cast which includes Dominic West (""300""), Imelda Staunton, Lucy Cohu among others. It may seem familiar however it's well filmed, well acted, well written and does provide some good scares and chills. *** out of 4 stars.",1370131200,,1586,4.4809688581314875

She is asked to come to a boy's boarding school and research the recent death of a boy and other reports of seeing the ghost of another boy who had died when the school was still a private home.  I was captured within the first few minutes and loved that it was more in the vein of Alfred Hitchcock than, say, ""Scream.""  There was no blood and gore but several great ""gotcha"" moments.  The story was well thought out and extremely well written.  There were several twists and turns that made you think the whole thing was wrapped-up, only to discover that it was just the beginning of the mystery.  The actors were spot on and it was a very eerie mystery with an excellent story; well told, beautifully filmed, and subtly done so that it made the scary moments that much more scary.

4982975,4,B006C0PPO8,"I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea about THE AWAKENING.  This is, ultimately, a satisfactory but not classic ghost story.  The audience for this film wants a good story and some chills.  What they get is a film that delivers modest chills, a decent story and a layer of ambition not often found in a film of this sort.

THE AWAKENING centers on Florence (Rebecca Hall, VICKY CHRISTINA BARCELONA), a young lady in 1920s England who makes her living exposing supernatural hoaxes.  (Much like Sigourney Weaver in the modern set RED LIGHT...an inferior film.)  She not only doesn't believe in ghosts and such, she doesn't believe in God either.  This melancholy woman is convinced to investigate a mysterious death at a boy's school.  The unfortunate child had claimed to have seen a ghost only shortly before meeting a rather unusual death.  The rest of the school is now living in fear that they are being stalked by a malevolent ghost of another boy who was murdered years before.

Florence begins her investigation, and works closely with one of the teachers, a history teacher played by Dominic West.  I don't want to say much more, but the movie does have some nice surprises in store.  Again, nothing that redefines the genre...but it takes us into some unexpected places.

The ""ambition"" I spoke of is the effort of the filmmakers to tie the events and characters and emotions of the film to the national psyche of Britain in these years just following World War I.  The film is essentially devoid of young men.  There are boys and there are older men who are physically and emotionally scarred by their time in the trenches.  This is a nation still grieving for the loss of so many to the war and the flu epidemic.  And this loss, this fear, this tenuousness informs the atmosphere of THE AWAKENING, and I appreciate the extra effort.

In the end, it doesn't really matter than much, unfortunately.  It's a ghost story / mystery story.  It's a decent story, but the melancholy bleeds into the pace of the film as well, and it drags in portions.  It feels as though the same territory is gone over several times.  And then, when the final 15 minutes or so arrives, and the movie spills its secrets...the pace because breakneck, almost to the point of not quite being able to keep up.

But I do recommend it overall.  This is not a ""scary"" film...it's a relative to films like THE ORPHANAGE, another moody ghost story.  (THE ORPHANAGE is superior...I only mean to roughly compare the tone and approach.)  I found Rebecca Hall and Dominic West to be very capable guides through the story.  Hall, as Florence, was an interesting character throughout, even when occasionally grating.  The terrific Imelda Staunton is on hand as well; although truthfully she isn't given much to do that stretches her.  This is a worthwhile film if you want mild creepiness, a decent mystery and don't mind a sometimes molasses pace.  I'd give the film 3.5 stars...but will round up to 4.",1367280000,,2977,4.713178294573644

4982989,4,B006C0PPO8,"Everyone likes a good ghost story. The problem is, in film, there are too few to see. Not the case here.

Here's the scoop. Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall), one of the few well educated women of her time (circa 1921) spends her waking hours exposing frauds in the psychic field. She's great at it. She also works to disprove the existence of ghosts and has written a book to that effect. She simply does not believe in anything beyond the here and now. She is summoned to a boarding school where there are rumors of a ghost that have the students frightened. She befriends one of the teachers, Robert Mallory (Dominic West), and she goes to work to get to the bottom of things. Problem is, the bottom is much deeper than either suspected.

I'm going to say, up front, I liked this a lot better than most reviewers here. Some thought it slow. I would call it subtle. There were a few cheap jump scares, but mostly it was a slow burn to the end. I liked the way the clues built up little by little. I liked the gear she used to try to detect fraud. Lots of vintage techie items. And then there's the doll house. This sends the creep dial way up to 11. And her character arc I liked a lot. You get to see the reasons she's so against the thought of a world beyond ours and what happens to her when she realizes she might have to re-think things. There are other items not unlike those found in the films ""In he Dark Half"" and ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" so when the hammer comes down, you're caught off guard and you need to reexamine the entire movie. The directing (Nick Murphy) was outstanding. He muted all the color tones so it underscored the era nicely. And he knows how to frame a shot. You could use most any scene as a wall hanging. He also used a couple of nifty camera tricks that added to the overall.

Some argued the ending, but there were a couple so I'm not certain which one they didn't like. If they are talking about the post script, I suppose I could agree. It was more than a bit on the cheap side. But, overall, this is the best ghost flick I've seen in a long time.",1365638400,,2084,4.205

Robert Malory, a teacher, invites her to a boarding school where a ghostly child has been spotted to debunk the rumor. The Awakening is a great slow-burn drama/horror.

I enjoyed the story in The Awakening. Sure, it's similar to other ghost stories- the rational skeptic that begins to question herself- but this film manages to stay interesting. It's not your typical haunted house, jump-scare thrill ride. It moves at a slow pace and plays out like a drama with horror elements. The horror is great, with a creepy setting and a few very effective and unexpected jump-scares. Be warned: it doesn't have many jump-scares, as it mostly relies on its creepy setting, suspense, and dialogue. Some parts of the ending were very predictable and some were a bit less, but the sense of ambiguity leaves the ending open for interpretation, which I like. Rebecca Hall did a great job as the lead, and so did the rest of the cast. The music was fantastic, as well.

Overall, The Awakening is a great drama/horror film- a great story and a handful of scares. Jump-scare horror fans should be wary of its slow pace. As of 3/31/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is recommended for fans of slow burning horror films, a rental otherwise.

It's not quite an edge-of-your-seat thriller like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Woman-in-Black/dp/B005LAIGP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Woman in Black</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Insidious/dp/B004LWZW2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Insidious</a>&nbsp;(both of which I loved).

I don't know. There's certainly a mildly creepy factor to it, but it's also kind of a mystery. More in the suspense genre than the outright horror genre as so many ghost story / haunted house movies are.

4983027,4,B006C0PPO8,"This is a lushly atmospheric ghost story that takes place in a Downton Abbey-like setting, the ideal place and time for a haunting. The nooks and shadows of the old estate, currently being used as a school, make good hiding places for indwelling spirits.

The story had a few problems for me. The logic of the haunting didn't quite seem to hold. Then the ending, while intentionally trying to be a bit ambiguous, does steer the viewer to one specific interpretation. So, like the story itself, it lies betwixt and between - being neither quite misty enough, nor quite clear enough.

There's also a problem with the main character. She transitions rather too quickly away from what would have been considered unseemly masculine assertiveness for the times. As the movie starts - she smokes, wears men's suits, and aggressively denounces sance charlatans. But soon after arriving at the school, she becomes susceptibly feminine in skirts and frilly blouses.

However, this movie is still worthwhile as a mood piece. It chills you with those eeriest of elements - old nursery rhymes and dolls' houses. If you like low-key, thoughtful ghost stories without gore - this is the movie for you.

It also has good extras. Director Nick Murphy introduces each deleted scene with a literate sort of essay of a commentary that will inform you about the process of making such an inherently interior story work when it's projected out onto the big screen.",1363132800,2,1442,4.921810699588478

The first half of the story is well paced and grounded in good story-telling, the second half gets a little silly at times with it's misplaced nudity and strange longing between the two lead actors as well as feeling a bit forced/contrived. If you can over-look those oddities in the plot the rest is worth the watch.

Rebecca Hall, who stars as the novelist who also seeks to reveal hoaxes in paranormal activity, is a compelling actress. She never looses her footing even when the movie slips and goes off course for a bit. She is a pleasure to watch from beginning to end.

I enjoyed the 'less-is-more' production of the movie. No major gore factor and minimal movie tricks to get you engaged in the story. Perfection is achieved with the rather bleak grayness of the school and it's grounds. The schools sparse furnishings and the toned-down sound track; it reminds me of the good old days when films didn't rely on over-the-top sound effects and movie scores that distract rather than enhance.

I like that there are no ""horror"" shots. You don't have to worry about seeing horrific carnarge on the screen. Everything is about your own imagination working away. As you watch the film there are clues dropped all along the way like a wayward child eating a biscuit on a trial.

It's not very scary and most of the jumps are very predictable, the plot line is original for the first half and then it gradually builds to a story that's not so  fresh. It has several dry spots and scenes that drag on a bit too long and some pointless nudity that felt a little silly.

What really makes me love this movie and would make me recommend it is the amazing soundtrack. Every score was incredible and was honestly better than any other part of the film. Along with the incredible soundtrack was the attention to vintage detail on every shot, every thing about the movie felt very authentic to its 1920s feel.

4983048,4,B006C0PPO8,"I enjoyed this one for several reasons. One being that it kept my interest clear through the movie. Another being the spooks, seldom seen and not unrealistic when seen. It kept it real in terms of the actual haunt in that the ghost appeared to be human to our star. Well done and the ending was fantastic.
I gave it a four only because I was never scared and I do so like the chills to the thrills. Overall a great movie and you won't be disappointed.",1361836800,,451,4.195402298850575

I normally love films set in victorian/edwardian times and a bonus being set in England. Not many horror movies are made without the gore factory, but this film relied on the story line, plot and being well acted without the blood and slashing. An enjoyable ghost story.

4983054,4,B006C0PPO8,"What is it about England that makes it the perfect setting for ghost stories? Is it the rainy and bleak weather? The turn-of-the-century period dcor has something to do with it I'm sure. From Sherlock Holmes mysteries to ""The Woman in Black"" and ""The Others,"" it seems Merry Ole England stands in the public eye as one of the most haunted countries in the world. BBC Films continues to feed this perception with the beautifully frightful ""The Awakening.""

The England of 1921 is suffering from the aftermath of World War I. Many people look to spiritualists for comfort by contacting those dead and missing through different occult avenues. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart travels the country debunking charlatans who use rigged sances and elaborate trickery to fool the innocent looking for answers from the afterlife. The skeptical woman is hired to investigate the appearances of a ghost boy at a secluded boarding school in the countryside. After several attempts at pinning the specters on mischievous students, Cathcart fights to prove to herself that the supernatural events she's experiencing aren't real.

It's evident that Director / Co-writer Nick Murphy had more on his mind when making ""The Awakening"" than what initially shows up on screen. He states in the extra features that the movie explores the reaction England had to the First World War and uses that as the basis for the events and attitudes of the characters. Florence Cathcart lost her belief in God or the afterlife because her fianc was killed in the war. Almost everyone in the film was affected in some way by the war, whether it is directly or indirectly.

Murphy used the time period to his advantage and created an effectively disturbing and gripping tale. It has some great twists and a wonderful setting in the quiet gray halls of an abandoned boarding house. Just don't expect the same types of jump-scares we get in Hollywood horror stories. ""The Awakening"" is sophisticated and provides its frights a little at a time.

Every actor in ""The Awakening"" delivers a standout performance. Imelda Staunton does a fabulous job playing the over-protective and nervous housekeeper named Maud Hill. Rebecca Hall completely embraces her unbelieving character and shifts through a huge range of emotions with ease as Florence Cathcart.

The DVD version of ""The Awakening"" contains deleted scenes with introductions by Director / Co-writer Nick Murphy. There's also a 25-minute featurette entitled ""A Time for Ghosts,"" which explores the setting and impact of historical events on the movie. It also delves into the history of spiritualism in England.

Viewing ""The Awakening"" is as pleasurable an experience as you can have watching a gothic horror story. Everything you want in a classic ghost tale is present - a big dark house, suspicious characters, and spectral presences. It also offers many deeper reflections on life than what we get from most modern American horror films.",1361577600,,2955,5.107660455486543

4983065,3,B006C0PPO8,"The setting in this ghost story is intriguing, as is the concept for the main character.  A ghost hunter in the 1920's, utilizing devices and apparatuses of the time to disprove and capture charlatans preying on the bereft makes for an interesting heroine. The actors, scenery, and locations used were all very good and the special effects were decent as well, if a little cliche at times.

The problem lies in the telling of the story.  I won't spoil it for people who would like to see for themselves, but the ending feels like a tired premise that's been rehashed too many times.  There were moments of confusion towards the climax that did eventually get resolved, though not in a very satisfactory way in my opinion.

I don't regret renting it.  It was engaging and entertaining, but it felt like it could have been so much more.  Perhaps a director's cut wouldn't have felt as disjointed in places, but that still wouldn't fix the problem of it being all too familiar.",1361145600,,974,4.6608187134502925

4983068,5,B006C0PPO8,"If your taste in ghost stories runs to the those with an eerie atmosphere and slow build up of suspense, such as The Others and The Woman in Black, you will probably enjoy this movie.  The acting is solid, the look into the early 20th century techniques of paranormal investigating was interesting, and there were enough creepy moments throughout to make it compelling. What bumped it up from being merely a good movie to a great one was the twist towards the end.  It was surprisingly heart wrenching, and I certainly did not see that coming.

Obviously, The Awakening won't be to everyone's taste, but it is going on my list of all time favorite ghost story movies.  Kudos to everyone involved in making it.",1360972800,,709,4.648

4983071,5,B006C0PPO8,"First of all, I was kinda hesitating to rent this movie because I had not heard anything about it and it was overseas.  (I know, I know it should not make a difference but I have watched some British films that were great and others that werent, so I wasn't really sure what to expect).  I love the fact that it is set back around the time of WWI.  So it is really early in the discovery of science and its use in proving the supernatural.  Rebecca Hall is just a beautiful woman to watch perform and Dominic West plays his character well.  Definitely has some twists and turns throughout the movie and some pretty spooky happenings.  I think it runs along the lines of The Woman in Black and The Others.  Not so much of a horror movie as it is a thriller.  Good hauntings and a good overall haunted house movie.  My daughter and I thought it was so good we watched it twice and then wished we had bought it rather than just rented it.  Its fun to go back and watch again to see if you can catch up on the ""hints"" in the storylines that you might have missed the first time.  Definitely at the top of my most famous ""haunting"" movies.",1360886400,2,1134,4.179723502304148

I loved this film!  And it gets better the second and third time around, when you identify more clues and are more relaxed.  And can enjoy the period details and photography without getting the bejeezus scared out of you! Rebecca Hall is amazing, certain to become more and more famous  the older she gets. Dominic West is - 'penetrating' to say the least. And the young actor playing Tommy just melted my heart. Maude, in the film, was so so perfect.

4983099,4,B006C0PPO8,I assume the ghost story as a genre has gone the way of the Dodo as tales that belong there get thrown in with horror now. They're not and never have been the same thing. In China and South East Asia they still very much know the difference and I'm sure they would love this offering. Horror is a lot of implausible stuff happening very quickly plus lots of blood hacking or biting. A ghost story has strong elements of sadness in it - it's essential to the genre (again Asian movies still capture this essence) and we have that here is a great example. A creepy sad tale... reminded me in tone of The Others (which was also set just after the first world war if I recall).

4983104,4,B006C0PPO8,"THE AWAKENING is one of those proper, slow-paced films the British are known for, e.g. ""The innocents,"" 'Burn Witch Burn,"" even last year's ""Woman in Black.""  Allegedly based on ""true events"", the movie centers on Florence Caphart (Rebecca Hall), a ghost debunker in 1921 England.  She is commissioned to validate the presence of the ghost of a murdered boy in a prestegious boarding school.  Once there, she uncovers lies, deceit, and the possibility of truly supernatural activities.  Along with the debonair history professor (Dominic West) and the charming housemother (Imelda Staunton), Florence finds herself facing the frightening fact the ghost is real.
Once you adjust to the movie's tempo, THE AWAKENING is an eerie ghost story although its twists and confusing resolution are frustrating.  Ms. Hall is especially good as the independent and edgy Florence.  West is effective as Robert and one-time Oscar nominee Staunton is the epitome of British servitude as the suppliant Maude.

4983113,2,B006C0PPO8,"This is a movie you watch because you like the genre (period pieces, ghosts, English mansion mysteries, boarding schools in the English countryside, etc.) Originality is not  as important as an imaginative story and an ambiance that invites words like spooky or  suspenseful.  Unfortunately, ""The Awakening"" never attains either. The plot is a combination of two or thee other movies I've seen before.  And despite the spectacular setting the movie never really takes off.  I actually began watching it with my director's eye, that is shooting scenes and calling for retakes, etc.  I watched the ""The Awakening""  because I like English ghost stories.  My expectations were minimal, but  unfortunately  I was not disappointed. ~G",1359763200,2,728,5.307017543859649
4983114,4,B006C0PPO8,"I waited for this film to come to one of my local cinemas, but it never seemed to get a wide showing.
Without giving away too much, it reminds me of ""Haunted"" with Aidan Quinn and Kate Beckinsale, especially the remote, creepy, mansion/boarding school brimming with secrets.
Rebecca Hall does a good job playing a strong, intellectual, woman - firmly grounded in science, but
secretly hoping for something more.
Dominic West plays a history professor dealing with the psychological debris of World War I.
All of the characters are haunted by things not necessarily of a supernatural nature, but there is still
something else lurking there......

Overall, I enjoyed the film, and am glad it finally became available.",1359763200,7,715,5.059322033898305

4983120,4,B006C0PPO8,"This is a very well done ghost story set in early 1920's Great Britain.  It is shortly after the first World War and terrible influenza epidemic and ""a time for ghosts"".  Florence Cathcart is a nonbeliever who investigates claims of the supernatural and has never found evidence to support any kind of haunting.  Then she is asked to investigate a boys' boarding school where the ghost of a boy is haunting the halls and has led to the death of one of the pupils.  Florence is a strong minded, modern woman who goes about her task a bit like Sherlock Holmes does when solving his cases.  Everything, in her mind, has a scientific explanation.  She sets up tests to record temperature, measure magnetic fields, and even track footprints.  As her investigation proceeds, what started out as just another false claim begins to get more complicated.  The story is interesting and the actors are perfect in their roles.  It's a bit predictable at times but never boring.  This is a film that I would highly recommend for horror fans.  There is some brief nudity and sexual situations so not for the younger ones.",1359244800,35,1107,4.713541666666667

4983124,3,B006C0PPO8,"The Awakening has all the trappings of a classical ghost story and starts strongly off the mark, mixing the post-Victorian fascination with seances, the massacre of World War I and the oddly placed skeptical brilliance of an educated lady who debunks the nonsense. Twenty minutes in, I was expecting a tightly plotted masterpiece that would keep me guessing and finally reveal some grand view from the jigsaw of clues. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

The movie is shot beautifully and the director trades cheap scares for a long brooding eeriness that permeates the look and feel of everything. There are even moments of horror genius involving a doll's house that will make your skin crawl. There are so many good elements that make it feel like The Shining meets the Woman in Black.

But then there are so many scenes that go nowhere, clues that mean nothing and a rushed (and ambiguous) conclusion that doesn't ring true. I must have counted a half dozen red herrings that add nothing to the plot and have no payoff whatsoever. And once you know the big secret of the film, playing it backwards doesn't make much sense either.

This is brilliantly acted, especially by Rebecca Hall who practically carries the movie, and the direction is perfectly creepy. The script on the other hand needed more polish - it could have been a indie horror film classic but instead leaves the viewer frustrated.",1358640000,35,1401,4.878151260504202

8496260,4,B006C0PPO8,"Despite its pedestrian title,  The Awakening is a well above average ghost story movie - one of the best of the last decade. In tone, it is similar to Jack Clayton's The Innocents and Robert Wise's The Haunting; so, very different from other excellent more or less contemporary ghost story movies like the American version of t
The Ring, Japanese version of The Grudge, and so on.

Specific attributes include a creepy, atmospheric, suspenseful tableau, occupied by complex characters  played by excellent actors,  beautiful cinematography, and a somber, sumptuous score.

All of the above should make it apparent that that's this is not one of those tossed off direct to DVD., streaming,  or Syfy channel horror flicks, but one in which the actors,  director, and other personnel were clearly invested, and trying to do something special.",1517616000,,839,5.125

We are back in time and there is a ""ghost"" problem as the school so the owners of the school call in a young lady to debunk this spirit problem. What she is finding is something that she cannot debunk, there is some mounting evidence that there is much more to this school than she first thought. This is a stunning movie in the pacing of it and it does not rely on the usual tricks to get you to jump. Instead we have this marvelous pace to the story. This is a very limited cast and what there is of the cast is the cream of the crop, they all have their parts down to a science. I can't say too much more about this without giving things away. I do recommend this to those who love suspense.",1510444800,3,817,4.0184049079754605

Woman frantically develops pictures as a man stands over her shoulder. She is desperately looking for the ghost that her equipment took a picture of. Not that the first one. The next? No. The third? Bingo. So she drops the pictures grabs the man next to her and they start tearing each other's cloths off as they fall on a nearby sofa having sex.

Yes? Me too. This movie had that scene in it. It was dumb. If you have seen ""The Sixth Sense"" you have seen this cheap weird incoherent knockoff. Just skip it. So much nonsense. So much unexplained. Just a mess.",1510358400,,628,4.322033898305085
