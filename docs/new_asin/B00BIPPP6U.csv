5622944,2,B00BIPPP6U,"I must be the only one who didn't enjoy this movie judging from the reviews.  I LOVE movies dealing with early American history.  However, I felt the acting was subpar and didn't even finish it.",1397347200,2,194,4.514285714285714
5622945,5,B00BIPPP6U,i can see why this film has won so many awards-so well done-it takes you right into the world of America before we won our freedom--to know people who really sacrificed--great movie!! Wonderful actors and story--we loved it.  Best for children over 12.,1394668800,4,252,4.8604651162790695
5622946,3,B00BIPPP6U,"A gripping story of the ""Civil War"" during the Revolutionary War between the loyalists and the ""rebels"". Very well done.",1391212800,2,120,5.05

5622949,5,B00BIPPP6U,"This is a wonderful addition to the historical record. Stories of the American Revolution in the south are hard to find, and this film is a must see for all those interested in the complex saga of our nation's birth.",1371081600,13,216,4.425
5622950,5,B00BIPPP6U,"This is such a great video depicting a hero who gave his life (as well as five of his sons) for our liberty. Henry Felder was born in Switzerland and came to America as a boy and loved ""his"" America. In Orangeburg, SC, he willingly gave his life for that today we can have liberty!!",1366934400,6,282,4.1454545454545455
5622951,5,B00BIPPP6U,"Mr. Felder, if you read this review, I thought you would like to know that my ancestor would have known yours. He served as a Sergeant in the SC Militia with the Fairfield regiment and the Turkey Creek regiment. He too fought at Orangeburg, among many other places. Like my name, his name was Robert Kilpatrick. I enjoyed the film. It underscores the importance of the War in the South and its importance for winning the Revolution. South Carolina's contribution is glossed over or almost forgotten in many modern treatments of the American Revolution. They fought when many thought Liberty was a lost cause for the colonies. Without Cowpens, Kings Mountain, dozens of skirmishes and battles like Orangeburg and Edisto... the British would not have surrendered at Yorktown. Thank you for reminding those who watch this film that liberty is not free.",1498176000,2,849,4.985915492957746

5622963,4,B00BIPPP6U,"This is a story for folks who want to get a southern view of the American Revolution.  Setting is South Carolina and it is not a big production but just a family and their neighborhood being torn apart by the times and the decisions being made as independence is being born. Divisions have always been a part of civil life and this movie gives us a peek beyond Philadelphia, Washington's army, and New England as the colonists struggled to find a place to plant the freedoms they valued.",1484697600,,487,4.534090909090909

This was not meant to be a big ticket Steven Spielberg production but a historical reenactment of events which most of us have never heard of before. In that vain, they did an excellent job considering that they probably did not have a multi-million dollar budget. Great story but most of all a great reminder of the people who got us here.",1476144000,,397,4.768115942028985

5623000,5,B00BIPPP6U,What a wonderful movie!  So impressed with the technical aspects and reality of the area which I have learned to call home.  Finding the story of one of the unsung heroes of the Revolutionary War was such a bonus.  Of particular interest was the beautiful love story portrayed by the main characters.  So touching to see the sacrifice displayed by the women of this period as they gave their sons and lovers to this desperate cause.,1462924800,,432,4.644736842105263

5623002,4,B00BIPPP6U,This was a good documentary that was transformed into a decent movie about an obscure individual who committed himself to the freedom of our country during the Revolutionary War.

5623005,2,B00BIPPP6U,"Its not you, its me. The greatest of subjects can't rescue a film made by amateurs.  I want actual directors directing actual actors, or at least talented standins for actors, and I want you to know how to do action scenes without looking like a bunch of children made the film. So while you tried hard and the subject is awesome, sit doen, please, this is going to be hard for you -- the execution here is most poor. You are very lucky to have won some awards, and I applaud your choice of leading men. He is sincere, engaging even.

5623019,3,B00BIPPP6U,"If you wanted to see a little slice of a corner of the American Revolution then you've come to the right place.  The production values and acting aren't excellent but they get the message across.  I thought the main character was being played by Rutger Hauer but I was mistaken.  It also shows that many of the engagements in frontier America were squad-size, or not much more, and that with the weaponry of the time made 10-12 men a formidable force against three or four entrenched men.  If you aren't expecting Jeff Daniels or Anthony Hopkins to be in the cast then it will be an okay movie to see.",1456531200,,601,4.4363636363636365

5623021,3,B00BIPPP6U,I read that this story is based on true events. For that I am thankful for being informed about freedom fighters seldom heard of by me. The acting is where this story fell down to the 3 stars I gave it. The enactment of battles was obvious that is was just an enactment. The rifles sounded like cap guns. The actors were ok but not  to the level of more than 3 stars. Kind of like the daytime soap actors. Perhaps just a little better in some parts but obviously not great. The story is what finally carried this film. I feel the actors were carried along by the story they were telling and have it to thank for me watching this through to the end. Good story but the acting was mostly bland however acceptable.,1455926400,,711,4.227941176470588

5623108,3,B00BIPPP6U,"A somewhat strange and entertaining little movie, but also a very mixed bag.  Obviously a labor of love by Clarence Felder, a direct descendant of Hans Heinrich Henry Felder, a Swiss immigrant who led backwoods Carolina patriot militia in combat against American Loyalist Tory militia fighting for the British King.  (This was the tragic civil war part of the Revolution, which was so characteristic of the war in the Southern colonies.)  The movie, barely an hour long, is obviously adapted for TV from Clarence Felders stage play Captain Felders Cannon.  Because of the running-time time constraint, the production is somewhat balky, leaping forward through years of the Revolution where we have no idea what Felder and his militia are doing.  The story moves at a gunshot pace, with little time for plot or character development  more like a documentary than a drama.  The production values are mixed.  The costumes and lush South Carolina locations are visually convincing, and the dialog fairly accurate to the period.  But the acting is mostly awkward and overdone, with the exception of Clarence Felder, who is a veteran of Broadway, Hollywood, and television.  The professionalism of his performance stands out in contrast.  I get the impression most of the others were purely stage actors, where performances have to be somewhat exaggerated to connect with an audience not in close proximity.  They obviously weren't accustomed to the subtler and more toned-down performance required by the close quarters of film acting.  If you're looking for a good historical depiction of guerilla war during the Revolution, this is your film.  If you're looking for a well-executed drama and storyline, you may want to skip it.",1453248000,6,1724,5.176895306859206

Championed by Captain Henry Felder (played by Clarence Felder) and his wife Catherine (played by Chris Weatherhead), this historic account based on the life of Captain Felder and his input in the evolution of America and its separation from British rule gives a powerful retrospect of identity and freedom. All For Liberty takes you into the struggles Captain Felder had to endure; his fight for freedom, equality, and justice was the people's fight. Music by Anthony DeRitis appropriately adapts the scenes throughout this film, with marvelous cinematography, film editing, art direction, and sound all done in Hollywood style. Wonderfully directed by Chris Weatherhead, All For Liberty focuses on details which give an account of a period in America when it was time to separate from the British Crown.

The portrayals are a little stilted but you quickly forget this as you are drawn into the struggles of the frontier militia against the better armed and trained British. The militia reverts to the unsportsmanlike actions of hiding behind trees and other cover and thus avoiding the frontal musket volleys  used by the British.

But there were also the clichd setups: the befriended Cherokee and African pre-American (?) who had been rescued from an illegal attempt to enslave him.
The acting certainly didn't help.
Worse still, was the music. Oh the dreadful score permeated every inch of footage.

5623176,5,B00BIPPP6U,"""All for liberty"" is an excellent and must see film and true life story about a Swiss American immigrant (Captain John Henry Felder ) who along with his militia fought and died against the British in the Revolutionary War. He wrote a document very similar to the Declaration of Independence for the colony of South Carolina. He was a patriotic American and was a key reason as to why we won the war. The actor who plays the title character (Clarence Felder) is a direct descendent of the Captain, giving meaning and realism to the purpose of this film, which is to accurately depict the true story.

Our founding fathers and the American patriots who gave their lives for the cause of LIBERTY, freedom, and justice, are the reason America was great. They made America, -carrying on the tradition and Conservative Christian values the ForeFathers brought to and instilled in America, when they came here to establish (and preserve) their religious freedom. These people were honorable. They were people of character such that never before and never after, was a nation so powerful created. Never before of after in the world have people of this caliber existed. These people gave their lives for us, for future generations, so we could be free, so our children could be free, so we could enjoy the fruits of liberty. There has never been and will likely never be again, people of such intellect, courage, and desire to do what is right; to ensure and uphold the public trust.

We however are loosing that liberty and have in fact lost much of it. We are living in a police state of traitors who work for the government and bankers who took over our central bank in 1913 and are mismanaging it. We are officially bankrupt and insolvent as a nation with $17+ trillion of official debt, and another $123 Trillion, in off balance sheet liabilities. We have a president who has allowed the murder and torture of hundreds of thousands of innocent people after we invaded their lands with no just cause in illegal and unjust wars. This president when campaigning stated that he would immediately end the wars upon taking office. He lied and has continued the cover-up of 9/11 which has continued to this day. He knew that Bush lied about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction to invade it. He knows that the Bush Administration, the military industrial complex, and members of  PNAC (Google it), among others, planned and executed the heinous and treasonous act (false flag attack) which killed thousands
of Americans and has negatively affected millions (all of us). These people are traitors, and our country will never again be whole until the crime is investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.

This traitorous crime of attrition against the American people for the personal financial gain of a few (and to establish their NWO agenda) continues to diminish and remove our constitutional rights; -The rights all patriots before us fought and died for, to establish and protect. We are in a new revolutionary war. For now, it must be a war information, to inform and educate those Americans who remain ignorant by the suppression of information. It is a war of high psychology against the American people, waged through politics with ill-gotten money on the backs of hard working ordinary Americans. It is a war where they are constantly trying to diminish and ultimately remove our 2nd Amendment rights; where guns and gun rights are under constant attack, while the police and the politicians violate their oath to defend and protect the constitution; and murder, attack, beat, detain and falsely imprison our children. It is a war where the police, instead of protecting and defending the citizens they serve, are agents of revenue generation, constantly harassing citizens for infractions, misdemeanors, or nothing at all; to justify their existence and
ultimately such that there are sufficient budgets to keep their jobs. In reality, we need more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens, less police officers, and zero unconstitutional irrational anti-gun legislation. We would be far better off as we used to be. ""An armed society is a polite society"". These politicians and the courts (lawyers), have removed our civil rights, and human rights to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". They have removed our right to defend and protect ourselves, and our friends and families. Instead we and our children are made the innocent and senseless victims of mass shootings. These are illegal and tyrannical actions. They think it is within their authority to interpret the meaning of ""Shall not be infringed"" when it is utterly and completely clear.

We live in a nation where they control, tax, and watch our every move under the false guise of ""terrorism"". There is no real terrorism. Terrorism is an essentially non-existent problem; but it is an age old strategy to perpetrate a false sense of fear on the people to control them; to get them to give up their liberty, and put citizens though an endless myriad of bureaucratic red tape. Politicians write thousands of new laws every year, instead of repealing them (or any). Even though it is an extremely important function of government, there is no financial or political incentive to repeal dysfunctional or unnecessary laws.

This country has changed so much in the last 40 years alone, I can barely recognize it. We are now living under the very same tyranny the forefathers, founders, and people of these generations fought against and died to abolish. We are trapped in a two party system, with no term limits where both parties (and career politicians) take legal and illegal bribes, to secure advantages for their special interest benefactors. These sociopathic power mongers who can never have enough money, and who are served so well by our politicians, desire to establish and fulfil their own agendas. In theory they have all the money they could ever need, but the reason they continue their lust to obtain more money at any cost, is to buy more power. Money buys power. Money buys governments and control over the citizens of a nation. Mayer Amschel Rothschild once said: ""Give me control of a nation's money [supply] and I care not who makes it's laws"". In the subsequent decades he and his descendants proceeded to take over the central banks of the largest most powerful nations in Europe, ultimately winning their greatest prize long after his death, -the USA. Their financial maneuvering and criminal corruption has caused World Wars, and the death and suffering of countless untold millions.

We are not a Democracy, but a Constitutional Republic. Every sovereign state in this nation is a Constitutional Republic. Every state however, and the Federal government are also private corporations, as is the Federal Reserve System. We are at a crossroads; the very same crossroads travailed by Americans before the revolution. Thomas Jefferson stated:

~""The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independent 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it's liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure.""~

Benjamin Franklin said: ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety (security), deserve neither Liberty or Safety (security), [and will lose both]. How long are we going to go down this path? How much are we willing to take before we demand a redress of grievances, and remove from office those who do not serve the constituents they are supposed to represent? What kind of America, and what kind of world are we going to leave for future generations? Are they going to have less liberty and freedom than we did? Are they going to live in a corrupt and tyrannical America where like today, their God given rights, will only be afforded them by those who see fit, and determine when and which rights to afford them? We need to take this nation back to the principles which made it great and unique in the world; and if we don't, or if we don't care enough, or aren't willing to make the sacrifice, then we are doomed as a nation, and the world is doomed also.

That is what this movie means to me. That was the feelings it evoked. That was the bravery and spirit of sacrifice, determination, hope, perseverance, and faith, -these people possessed. The two party system is divisive. That and many other challenges we face as a nation. The financial elite power mongers know this. That's why it's continually perpetuated. It is a classic strategy for control over the masses: ""Divide and Conquer"". A libertarian, or an independent who actually represents the people will never get elected.

Liberalism is a main cause of the gradual destruction of America. Liberalism is not progressive. It is ignorance pure and simple. This coming from a former Democrat in the Bay Area. Liberalism perpetuates the destruction of the very premise and foundation of what made America great.

5623190,1,B00BIPPP6U,"The only arena in which star ratings cannot be in any way trusted on Amazon has to be with movies. They average at least 1.5 stars too high overall (our family routinely adjusts downward by 20%). Even so, that is still far, far too charitable for this strange campfire skit that somehow gets to be called a movie.

I actually tried (ineffectually) to get a refund after 4 minutes of watching it, as I think one could argue that it's a form of fraud to call it a movie.

While many have noted that the makers of the movie have taken pains toward accuracy, that unfortunately does not a movie make. To say it is low budget is to understate the situation, but even that is no guarantee of a terrible ride. The acting is...well, it's not. My son's 4th grade production of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was smoother, better lit, better produced, and even when the actors forgot their lines they were STILL more animated than these people.

5623192,1,B00BIPPP6U,"The positive reviews written herein, is proof that you people are nuts!  This movie looked like it was directed by someone with severe autism.  The acting was less believable than cartoons and the actors moved around like some sort of space-brain parasite was controlling their bodies.  There was no narrative that connected any of the action, people just appear in the woods, in a bar, in a house and start talking like they had a little too much of the rum they keep on referring to in the movie.  The lead actor or Warrior, is so fat he can barely move, his son has a Brooklyn accent, and the Freeman when recounting meeting the lead actor many many moons ago, is exactly the same age as when he is recounting the story as he is in the flashback-must have been an old soul.  I will give major props though to one character, the King of England, who is often referred to in the movie, and yet though a little insane around 1777 still had the good sense not to be in this film.

I think the budget for this thing is about $900, and I don't know where the money went, because there is not much here.  A lot of this must have been filmed at historical sites and I kept on thinking security was going to just show up while they were doing a scene and ask everyone to leave-actually I THINK THEY DID AND THEY JUST CUT IT OUT  OF THE FILM.

Its amazing that some of you Jabronies actually liked the acting.  Well the only thing I can say is you need to start renting Low Budget dubbed Kung Fu movies from the 70's-  You will be in heaven.  Are you people high or what?!  You actually liked the acting, the acting !!!?

I hope they are not planning to show this in schools, they need to save it for detention, I know its cruel but they deserve it.

5623213,4,B00BIPPP6U,"The fact that this film is dry is due to its low budget production.  However, do not let that from dissuade you from viewing it, for the period clothing is exact, as are the armaments and objects of everyday life in the mid to late 18th century.  The quality of the acting is good although the actors themselves are not well-known.  I did detect one church steeple that was more Victorian than that normally seen during that period of American history, and I also saw one man being disarmed, during the course of which, his obviously 20th century eyeglasses were visible briefly.  The entire film was shot on historic locations and is more of a live-action-play on film.  This of course will not appeal to everyone viewing it, but at least the history the film presents is far more accurate than those period films where Hollywood has taken liberties with the actual facts.  Overall, I like this film very much and hope to purchase a copy as soon as I can.",1409616000,12,956,4.56140350877193

5623216,5,B00BIPPP6U,"I just watched ""All for Liberty"", the Historical based story line of the American Revolution is awesome, the acting is superb.  The American Revolution did have different campaigns and strategies, this movie reveals the Southern Campaign and strategies.  This movie also reveals a good taste of the culture, sharing the courtesies and customs of the 1770's for they did use a more formal language.  It was truly a mixture of European Settlers/Colonists with English being the dominate language and People who formed our Nation.  I Really enjoyed this Movie; it would be great for Home-schooled and our Public School Children to learn from!",1408838400,4,639,5.174757281553398
5623217,5,B00BIPPP6U,"During the American Revolution, we're taken on a journey of love, hatred, camaraderie, and war. Henry Felder's fight in South Carolina is an amazing true story about his courage and standing up for liberty. This is one of the best war movies I have seen because it doesn't glamorize anything. All for Liberty gives us what really happened and facts along the way. I recommend All for Liberty to anyone who wants to see a great journey to freedom. My favorite quote from it is: ""Sometimes only one man standing up for what is right is sufficient to alter a wrongful deed."" Very true.

Worth watching until the very end!  I loved the entire movie! The plot and the historical essence tells the story of a real live person, Capt. Clarence Felder, and his part in helping to secure freedom throughout the Charleston, SC area during the Revolutionary War. If you like watching real historical movies, you know the one's you never hear about, this is one worth watching.

There are no spectacular special effects.  Even the combat scenes are filmed with limited effects.  However, if you approach this movie for what it is - a history lesson on film making use of reenactors and people who made sure that the clothing, weapons and other props are accurate, you will probably enjoy it.  The movie is accurately based on the career of Captain Henry Felder and the militias of the South Carolina back country in the American War of Independence.  These militias were an important contributing factor to the eventual defeat of Lord Cornwallis in the South which led to American victory in the war.  This movie does not tell their story as spectacularly as Mel Gibson's The Patriot, but it does so with more historical accuracy.  I recommend watching both.

As others have noted, Captain Felder is played by one of his great grandsons, Clarence Felder, who also wrote the play upon which the movie is based.  I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime.",1507939200,,1147,4.835897435897436
