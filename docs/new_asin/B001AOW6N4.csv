8278386,1,B001AOW6N4,"I liked Hugh Beaumont in ""Bury Me Dead"" within ""Classic Film Noir"" with June Lockhart. However, Hugh cannot save this film. This film has no plot. It is one person telling another person to do good and help others; literally, throughout the film; over and over again. There is no story where that moral is acted out. This is an extremely boring film. I agree with the message, but I thought I was purchasing a story; there is no story. This is not like any movie you have ever seen. The entire film is very staged. There is no acting, because there is no story; just actors standing on their marks and saying lines in a monotone voice. I agree with the movie's message, but you are better off listening to a sermon in church, which would be more interesting, and more lively.",1496448000,,775,4.426573426573427

For a movie that was not done by a major studio but rather a church organization, it's held up nicely & it holds its own. A few pops and cracks here and there and lines running through at times. Not bad for a movie that should have deteriorated and been lost forever. It's definitely a movie that was used by the church to help lead others to Christ. I love old movies of any kind. I love the history of it all. If you are like me in that respect, this DVD is well worth your time and money.",1264032000,3,607,4.024793388429752
