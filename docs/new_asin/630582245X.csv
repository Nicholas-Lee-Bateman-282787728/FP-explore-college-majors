1081097,1,630582245X,"I guess everyone has to start somewhere.  This 1990 film, released direct to video in 1993, and re-released this year, harkens back to the beginning of Sandra Bullock's film career when she was probably thrilled to get a B  movie script.  Actually, to call this a B movie would be the kindest of  prevarications.  It was nowhere near that good.  A mediocre plot was marred  by dreadful directing, wretched cinematography and awful acting.
The film  starts out like a recruiting film for the protest arm of the Sierra Club,  with people locked in human chains to keep loggers from cutting down the  rainforest.  The leader is assassinated and then our heroine (Sandra  Bullock), teams up with a whacked out photo journalist (Craig Sheffer) to  find the killer and expose corruption.  At this point it tries to convert  to an action adventure thriller in the jungles of the Amazon.
It  fails.
There are so many things to criticize in this film, I hardly know  where to begin.  Let's try cinematography.  The color quality was awful,  scenes were constantly out of focus and the lighting was poor.  We had  overexposures, and underexposures with no regard to effect.  How about  audio? The sound was muddy, the music was poor.  And acting?  The acting  was amateurish, bumbling and shrill.
Directing?  Luis Llosa must have  been on a tight budget.  It seems like he did the whole film in one take.  Actors were flubbing lines all over the place, but the cameras kept  rolling.
Okay, but what about Sandra?  She was a raw talent at this point  (in more ways than one).  This film provides us with her one and only nude  scene, which may be its only claim to fame.  But don't rush to the movie  store to rent it because of this.  Though it is clear she is fully unclad,  you really see nothing, which is probably a blessing.  I love Sandra  Bullock, but let's face it, she has a body only Popeye could love, and adds  nothing to a film by appearing in the buff.  Actually, her acting here  showed promise, especially in one scene where she is trying to revive a  child just rescued from a fire.  But there is a clear difference in her  skills and confidence compared with present day.
This film is a must NOT  see for anyone, especially Sandra Bullock fans.  Why mar your good opinion  of her.  I rated this film a 2/10.  It is an appalling waste of time.  Why  they revived it, I can only wonder.",962409600,6,2392,4.540284360189573
1081098,3,630582245X,"The most interesting aspect is seeing Sandra Bullock early in her career, and of course the much hyped love scene with Craig Sheffer. (This scene is of course what is driving sales of the DVD) The scene tries to be tasteful,  and for the most part is, but lacks the sexual energy of say ""The  Thomas Crown Affair"".  Ms Bullock still deserves alot of credit for  trying to add some class to the film, and showcased early signs of her  career to come. Other interesting aspect of the film included Character  actor Juan Fernandez, a case of going ""I know I have seen him  someplace before""), and the cinematography what is actaully quite  good.",962409600,7,642,4.5701754385964914
1081099,1,630582245X,"First and foremost, let me state that Sandra Bullock is my absolute favorite and this review is not a reflection of her.  This movie is below disappointment. There is almost no plot.  The production is poor (i.e.  non-continuous cuts, actual cut outs of audio effects, stereo effects  reversed! (Unbelievable)) It is only seventy some minutes long  but seems  like hours. As for you voyeurs wanting an 'unrated' version, forget it.  There is more 'unrated' in the first thirty seconds of most other movies  than in this entire movie (which I am extremely pleased with, Sandra  Bullock is above that kind of perversion). If you want a movie, get Air  Force One.  If you want a glimpse, get Eyes Wide Shut. I heard that the  release of this movie was almost blocked by one of its members due to its  poor plot/production.  It is easy to see why.  Do not waste your time or  money on this one.  Again, it is very important that you understand that  this review reflects the movie and not Sandra Bullock.",962150400,8,1000,4.617142857142857
1081100,1,630582245X,"I think that Fire on the Amazon is a very poor movie, but manages to mantain some interest in its plotline. It was produced in Peru amazonia by Roger Corman and directed by peruvian film maker Luis Llosa (in fact,  cousin of writer Mario Vargas Llosa). For me, the main interest in the film  is the presence of a very young Sandra Bullock, who performs her only one  nude scene. It is a ""must see"" for every fan of hers.",957830400,11,420,4.225

It's on par with Anna Nicole Smith's To the Limit and Skyscraper  but, at least those two have real good old fashioned nudity
This film is a different story

This film only got the home video release due to Sandra Bullock making a name for herself in Hollywood and becoming a massive A List star
The film is barley watchable it's a slow burn with a poor story
If you think you'll find a great nude/sex scene think again it to like the film is more smoke and mirrors then anything else
It's super tame and is more PG-13 then Unrated (They smacked the unrated on the film to sell it as this mature for adult film)
Not a good film for a early up and coming star! It  should've stayed buried a massive waste of time  3/10

Well, that was until now....what in the world was Sandra thinking when she made this movie?  Was it supposed to be this bad? As bad as the script was, could they have least cast a much hotter (more masculine acting) guy in the lead role opposite Sandra? At least it would be an okay movie to see her hook up romantically with someone that was worth her beauty.
*Disclaimer about Blind Side:  loved the movie, the message, and Sandra's acting....I do not like the person that she portrayed. I think Leigh Ann Tuohy is an arrogant, publicity seeking person and exploited this ""great act of kindness"" in order to obtain some noteriety.

1081374,5,630582245X,"This movie kept my interest from beginning to end.  Perhaps the character of Alyssa was not the best one for Bullock because we have a paradigm of her as a strong forceful woman.  In this movie, she played a softer more innocent part.  She followed the director's directions, and did her job well.  It seemed to me that the director ran a tight ship.  I can see it from the tone and cadence of Bullock's voice, to the way she moved.  The love making scene was also tightly directed I noticed by the way they kissed and moved. At any rate, the movie was a good watch for me, even though I prefer the ""stronger woman"" persona that Bullock portrays within her other movies.",1395532800,,670,4.362903225806452

[Also, what's up with the ""nipple"" taping for Bullock, according to Craig Hosada's ""Bare Facts"" guide.]  I agree with some reviews that Sheffer was obnoxious and Bullock was ok, and this movie's one scene is about as revealing as she's ever likely to get, but it was ok.

THE GOOD
Nothing, may have gotten better after the half way mark, but it was a pain to make it that far.
THE BAD
Everting about the movie.  Sandra's acting is bad.  And the guy playing opposite her, is just horrible.  So bad that it was almost like watching a man who is acting like, who is acting like, who is taking pictures.  Editing was poor.  Was there even a director in this film?  This was a film that was unreleased, upon untill Sandra became a star.  They should have burned all copies, and filmed that, because that would have been a better film to watch.
C.P.O.V.
Some cuss words, but other than that, I couldn't say.  Mind keep wandering, film was too boring.-EJW",1089590400,3,733,4.338235294117647
1081497,1,630582245X,"can't believe that Fire on The Amazon needed to be cut (there's the R-rated version of 78 minutes and another one of 85 minutes). Really, there isn't anything particularly disturbing...well, there is absolutely nothing offensive...really.
And for those who think that the nude scene with Sandra Bullock worths it, I don't know what planet you can be from...really, I didn't know there was that scene before watching it, and if I had known, I wouldn't have rented this, because, even though the scene doesn't show anything, I didn't want to see Sandra doing the thing.
Anyways, these few lines were an overview of the whole film's point, so you can imagine how pointless this film can be. The storyline has nothing particular, though it is not bad either, but nothing comes out of this movie...It talks about an environmentalist that has been murdered (and the killer used an arrow, to make people believe it was an indian-were they making a joke to show how stupid authorities can be and believe that if the guy has been killed with an arrow, it automatically has to be an indian guy that killed him?). And a journalist (Craig Sheffer)(who has the bad -and that will probably get on your nerves- habit of always taking photos) followed by a woman that works nearby (Sandra Bullock) investigate and go further in their researches of the real killer (because an indian had already been accused).
Well, the acting in this film isn't bad at all, and that's really surprising, because Sandra Bullock has, usually, the habit of playing her characters like an half-brained maggot. But in this film, she is actually really natural and good. The storyline is very ordinary, but its development is really poor. The directing is painful to watch, especially because of the picture quality, but also for the atmosphere that it delivers-it makes the film even more boring.
Actually, the major problem with Fire on The Amazon is the plot. Really, it looks as if they first wanted to make an adventure movie, with an investigation, but the director and producers seemed to have had a change of their mind, and to have changed their objectives of the film. Let me explain. (Spoilers warning) There's a part where Bullock and Sheffer try to follow an indian guy in a boat. When they arrive, another man tries to kill them (and hits Sheffer in the shoulder, after what he seems totally okay, by the way), but they survive. After this mild peril (and the way it happens it really is mild peril, because the director doesn't seem to know how a scene of suspense should be done!), they join the indians in their village, and they eat some kind of herbs that make them high. And that's where the director had his mind twist...he made his characters eat some herbs and he gives the reason that it's an indian ritual...and it gives him a reason to introduce a scene of sexuality, where Sheffer and Bullock (who previously couldn't stand each other, by the way) make love while they're high, in very multiple positions (and that's what shocked the censors, even though there is no visible nudity showing anyone's private parts). Now, the question is; why did they put this scene? Maybe they've been inspired by the herbs they smoked before writing the scenario...and it's an inside joke by the producers...I didn't find it funny anyways...After that, another mind twist from the director, which is to kill some characters. There are some gunfights (really, this doesn't even deserve to be called ""action"", the fight scenes are shameful).
One other thing, the running time. I've seen the 85 minutes version, and even though 85 minutes represents a very short film in my opinion, this was long and dull. Nothing happens in this film, nothing makes you jump on your seat. Every time something supposedly (or that is supposed to be) interesting, you just realize how lame and wrongfully filmed it is. Luis Llosa (who also brought us masterpieces such as The Specialist, Sniper, and of course, Anaconda- feel the sarcasm here?) just doesn't know how to deliver some scenes, and in this film, it happens to be the most important ones that he missed.
Finally, Roger Corman is the producer...I'm saying it again, Roger Corman is a symbol...when you see that name on a movie box, and you're looking for some quality film, avoid it. Roger Corman is a synonym of ""bad movie"" or ""cheesy movie"" or ""lame movie"". And this one doesn't even have the merit of going in the ""cheesy"" category. This is plain bad, and boring. Bullock acted very well, for the first and last time in her career, but when you're falling asleep while watching a movie, even if the lead actress is good, it's still a very bad movie...",1065484800,3,4668,4.771322620519159
1081498,2,630582245X,"As someone who greatly enjoys Sandra Bullock's unique blend of intelligence and wit, I was curious as to what her first ""major"" film outing was like-- particularly after seeing such mixed online reviews of Fire On The Amazon. Well, Sandy was just finding her acting chops in this one, and really did quite well, given what she had to work with. But oh boy, was she ever saddled with a cheesy, pretentious script, thoroughly annoying co-star and a largely gratuitous sex scene! The script, while earnest and well-intentioned (i.e., saving the rainforest), was far too heavy-handed to be effective; it could have been a pretty good story with more subtlety in the dialogue and direction. The co-star, the Heath Ledger lookalike whats-his-face, was one-dimensional, potty-mouthed, way too eco-groovy and unlikely to survive more than ten minutes in the Amazon basin without someone feeding him to an anaconda. And the ""infamous"" jungle tryst between the two perspiring do-gooders was notable only for its unconventional (for the movies, anyway) sexual positions; Sandy didn't *really* embarrass herself, but the experience must have convinced her, once she did end up with some clout, to avoid such scenes again.
In the final analysis, Fire On The Amazon is a curiosity for Sandy aficionados, but is otherwise not worth the price of admission. Better to spend the money on some shade-grown coffee instead.",1061424000,2,1402,5.180616740088106

1081540,1,630582245X,"Not a good start to a career! I bought this DVD a couple of months ago, after reading some reviews, and discovering it very cheap in HMV. So I bought it. And I only just watched it for the first time. Normally I buy DVDs and watch them straight away. This one I kept putting off, and off, and just never watching it today. Finally, I decided I would watch it. It got off to a very slow start, and then Sandra Bullock and the very Heath Ledger-looking whatshisface, Craig Sheffer, appeared. I only really bought this to see what Sandra Bullock was like in one of her very early films. The very porn film style sex scene was not needed, and it could have done with much less & still given so much more. (Did that make sense?) Much too graphic, and my little innocent eyes :) practically popped out my head! Sandra Bullock's character was played v. well, but I read in an interview recently, that Sandy has written into her contract that she will NOT do sex scenes anymore. Any wonder why, after seeing this? Craig Sheffer's character was very much the wide-boy, constantly taking photos, and getting generally annoying.
One good thing about this movie ... OK, two! One, is it's only 85 minutes. So pretty short. (Here's me talking, I was getting bored by only 38 minutes!) The second is the song over the end credits. I love it! I'm hunting here trying to find it.
The extras on the DVD ... More than I actually expected for a basic DVD! It had the trailer (which showed too much of the film), and a photo gallery, and trailers of other films out at the same time - none of which I've heard of, and most of which I surprisingly want to see!
I was surprised that this film received an 18 certificate. Apart from the sex scene, there was really nothing else which deserved it. Hardly any violence. So ... that was surprising.
Sandy is not her normal self. In more recent films, she's either playing an action girl (Speed, Speed 2), or being her witty charming self (Miss Congeniality, 28 Days). In Fire On The Amazon, she hasn't found her niche yet. She plays it very blandly, and still manages to put up with Craig Sheffer's character. Something I wouldn't have managed to do, no matter how much he looked like Heath Ledger.
Do not make the mistake of buying this DVD. It's very very bad. It's not a film I would consider watching again - along with Murder By Numbers.",1051488000,4,2365,4.414187643020595

1081548,1,630582245X,"""Fire on the Amazon"" was a major disappointment...
With Sandra Bullock (""Speed"", ""The Net"") and Craig Sheffer (""Fire in the Sky"") in an Amazon rainforest setting, I was sure  ""Fire on the Amazon"" was going to be a keeper to add to my  collection of favorite films.  Unfortunately, I was dead wrong and  extremely disappointed!
The plot starts out with our ""reporter""  (Sheffer) meeting Bullock working with a Sierra Club type of environmental  group in a nameless South American country.  The character of our  ""reporter"" fluctuates from ""don't give a damn"" about  the rainforest, to suddenly demanding to venture into the rain forest with  Bullock in a dugout canoe to determine if an Indian was murdered by the  police.
The entire plot is weak, and the excuses for plot development  are not at all credible.  Character development is thin, as there is really  no strong chemistry between Bullock and Sheffer - the cliche animosity  towards each other at the beginning of the film is weak and not developed,  and there is little or no excuse for them to team up in the middle of the  film.  And there is no character development or warming up towards each  other as the film progresses.  Suddenly there is the requisite cliche  ""love"" scene for no reason at all (let's just call it a  ""skin and sex"" scene with no feelings), which is so poorly edited  that there is no continuity at all (some scenes mostly nude, with other  partially clad scenes edited in, all with no sense of flow, buildup, or  climax.)
The overall quality of the cinematography was extremely poor and  appeared to be low budget - in many cases handheld, poor focus, poor  framing, and just plain noticeable sporadic amateur jerkiness, quite  obviously not intentially meant to be handheld POV shots. The film color is  dismally washed out and out of focus throughout most of the film, the  editing looked like it was done by amateurs (the credits revealed two  Editors and two ""Apprentice Editors"" who may have done much of  the editing).
Weak acting and botched lines seemed very ""high  schoolish"" throughout the film.  Native costumes were not at all  authentic (looked like Polynesian towels and grass skirts, not at all like  the breechcloths and ornamentation I have have experienced firsthand of  real rain forest tribes!), setting was not established well (no shots of  rainforest villages or developments of Indian characters that I was hoping  for), hair styling was mostly wet and ragged for both main characters  throughout the film, music was for the most part amateurish or non-existent  in many scenes, and even the theme-song at the end of the film was  extremely amateurish (was it Bullock herself trying to sing the theme-song?  No mention of the song or singer in the credits).
Overall the film was  extrememly amateurish, unbelievable, and highly disappointing.  It wasn't  until later that I realized this film was an early, apparently low-budget  film for Bullock, shot in 1990 and never released until now that she is  popular. If you like Bullock, don't get this film!  If you like Amazon  rainforest films, I would rather recommend seeing ""Emerald  Forest"", ""The Medicine Man"" or ""The Mission""  instead.",963446400,26,3199,4.928436911487759
