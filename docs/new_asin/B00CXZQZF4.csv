5751744,5,B00CXZQZF4,"Great quality restoration!  For years, the only version available was a poor quality example with Czech subtitles--nearly unwatchable.  But this restored print has outstanding picture and excellent sound. If you are a Ritter and/or Stuka fan, it's a film you should own.",1421193600,7,270,5.404761904761905
5751745,4,B00CXZQZF4,"All propaganda, but fantastic for the times, interesting that all the countries involved in this terrible conflict, had very similar propaganda movies, self sacrifice, comradeship in the face of adversity, bravery and all the characters believe in ultimate victory. The thing when watching these movies and I have a number of them is to remember the era in which they were made. I remember my daughter came out and watched the movie for a short time, turned to me and said ""Dad those special effects are awful, and Black and white is ridiculous. I informed her it was made in 1940, however that did not seem to have any desired effect at all. Alas we may be the last generation to appreciate these movies for what they are. Recommended.",1421193600,5,736,4.713178294573644
5751746,2,B00CXZQZF4,"This film is in line with other films of the period as far as production and special effects-The German model makers don't seem any better then anyone else.  The British are portrayed as the threat, and the French seem to dislike the British more then the Nazis.
When this film was made Germany was winning, and this may explain the way combat is treated.  Story wise I think Wing and Prayer, and Flying Tigers are more enjoyable films.  Nice to see Stukas fly around but not much else worth while in the film.
I bought from IHF, and the film came quick and well packaged.  Some parts appeared to have been repaired with low quality clips, but it does not distract from the over all film.",1408579200,3,688,4.436507936507937
5751747,4,B00CXZQZF4,"Consider where, who made it.  No worse than any Hollywood film of the era.  Real Stuka!  Overall, a tolerable film to watch.",1401926400,9,124,4.545454545454546
5751748,4,B00CXZQZF4,"One of Karl Ritters 'Zeitgeist'films,it is a rather set-bound effort. Still,the ariel shots and inserted newsreel combat footage give the film an air of excitement that seems to be missing in many war propaganda films of the period,including the British films

What makes this film special?It is so politically incorrect! War is shown as great fun with death and injury an unfortunate by-product. The scene in which Carl Raddatz eulogises on death and sacrifice for the Fatherland is cringing to watch yet,given the era that it was made,it was a necessity to portray war in such a way,both for the Germans and the British.

Furthermore,having recently viewed this film again,I would like to say that,of all the wartime propaganda films from all countries,it is the most stirring that I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Wagner then I can reveal that his music features prominently in this film,especially towards the end. The final scene,where the Stuka squadron take off to attack England,is a masterpiece of motivational propaganda. I challenge you to resist the temptation of bombing London after viewing this!

All in all though,a film that should be viewed with regard to the era that it was made.",1384300800,33,1202,5.0

8587430,4,B00CXZQZF4,"For what this movie is, it is a decent, if not a little boring.  It plays not unlike the USA Hollywood propaganda flicks. Very familiar in that respect.  The movie glorifies the Stuka through the actions of a Stuka group operating at the front.  It would make the uneducated watcher thing it was quite the super plane.  Though representing the Germans in WWII, it does not focus on Nazi ideology but rather the men and machines at war.  The Germans are portrayed as dashing young men.  The enemy {British and French} are not portrayed, as in our own propaganda, as fanatical beasts.

An interesting window into the past from the perspective of the other sides movie industry.",1474675200,,675,4.717948717948718
8587431,5,B00CXZQZF4,"Propaganda at its finest.  Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda was often used to satisfy the minister's self-image of being a great movie producer.  ""Stukas"" is well made, but all of the pilots are handsome Aryan types without a doubter in the bunch, all heroic, never failing to complete a mission or hit a target.  Losses occurred, but the survivors carried on, stoic as always, returning to base with even greater purpose.  A really good war film,if hokey in spots, such as the finale with all pilots singing the Stuka song.",1471910400,,524,4.853932584269663

8587434,4,B00CXZQZF4,"The talking parts were to fast and load, like they were all yelling their lines instead of steady talking. I know sometimes you have to yell during battle so others can hear you over the sound of battle. Some parts were graining and 1 point in the movie it skipped maybe my machines fault but all in all I like this since I am a STUKA fan.",1463443200,,339,4.074626865671642
8587435,5,B00CXZQZF4,"the dialogue is spit out rather fast as was the case back in the day ... its an interesting look thru enemy eyes... and rather boisterous pride over the most advanced plane (at the time ) the deadly Stuka dive bomber... join the brave crews of Hitlers Luftwaffe and they bomb the ""Frogs"" ( French army) and the ""Tommies""( the English army) as they fight their way to the invasion of Britain. all the while finding Pianos left and right for their Doctor to play tunes for them during the down times... its really a nice slice of history and worth the price to me. i recommend it for any ones collection.",1451001600,3,602,4.383928571428571
