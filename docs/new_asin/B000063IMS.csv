1689669,4,B000063IMS,"Well, first let me start off by saying I haven't seen THIS DVD as it hasn't come out yet, so I can't commment on quality of picture and sound. However, I have seen the original version in japanese cinema, and it's a great movie.
It is apparent that it had a big budget, and as I understand it was meant to be ""the movie of the year"" back in -98 when it came out in japan. (hence the big budget)
For some reason, the hoopla about the movie vanished. But don't get fooled by this and think it's a bad movie, becous it's not.
I won't mention anything about what this movie is about since it's allready written in the editorial review, but... animation and soundtrack is great.
Oh, and eventhough(?) it's about the ark and aincient artifacts, this is an action flick, much in the same style as Akira. No, it's not exactly like Akira, and the fact that the maker of Akira was involved in making this film, it's unfair to say that it's ""his"" movie. This one is quite able to stand on it's own legs!
Maybe I should mention that this is a animated version of a manga with the same name, and this movie deals with the first part of the manga... So if you've read the manga, you know what to expect, and if you haven't, you'll know where to look for more answers to events happening in the movie, as the manga is much longer. (obviosly)
I gave this movie 4 stars becous I leave it to the other buyers to raise it to 5 ;)
So, buy it, see it, like it!",1015718400,,1439,4.142857142857143

1689679,5,B000063IMS,"This is a really cool film, and the fight scenes are sweet. I hear the animator or creator of this was the one who did Akira too. You can definitely see this because the main character at the end seems similar to the kids in the Akira film.

1689683,5,B000063IMS,This is a great film that i just watched their is everything here for someone who enjoys action films. this movie combines the mummy and james bond and a little bit of iron man ( the reason why i say iron man is because the main person in the film uses a battle suit it is not like iron mans but it does make him stronger and faster and has gadgets and he does fight cyborg men) I do not want to give away to much but this film is not to be missed.,1274140800,,448,3.776595744680851
1689684,5,B000063IMS,"Say what you will about it not having this or that, but ya know...I don't watch a horror film to hear jokes and I don't watch a comedy to see gore. Catch my drift? I was so thankful this had NO obligatory underlying romance story (ie every other anime in existence, notably Akira, Ninja Scroll...which are still in my top 10, but i digress...) If you wanna see killer action, sick gun fights and arch nemesis(esque) showdowns on 2 accounts(!), then this is the one. Solid Snake (Metal Gear Solid) super commando type of protagonist, evil little @$$hole kid with psionic powers, crazy sci-fi inter-dimensional surreality, and, oh yeah, CARNAGE!
  Look folks...I'm like a very sophisticated savage, and NOT like those ridiculous Geico neanderthals/chromagnons/whatevers, meaning I like a well thought, intelligent anime like Perfect Blue or what-have-you, but if you, like me, want something that is not overbearing with convoluted plot, but has SOME kind of enticing story, and you like your share of gore, action and whacky sci-fi mechanoid craziness, look no further!
  Let me put it this way...I sleeplessly searched forever it seems trying to remember the name of this freaking movie just to find it again because it was driving me crazy. They just don't make good animes like this anymore. Everything now is big eyed cutsey girls and drawn out dramatic scenes. yeah...thats great, but sometimes they can wrap it up a little quicker and still do a good job. anyway...get this.
***make sure you get the original 1998. this copy is not what I watched and the cover is kinda suspicious. The ultimate whatever dvd looks more like. Don't worry...this review will be on there too for you to read AGAIN!",1266883200,,1699,4.93006993006993
1689685,5,B000063IMS,"Back in 1998, ""SPRIGGAN"" was an anime hyped for it's beautiful animation, based on a very successful manga series and of course, the people behind it.

  ""SPRIGGAN"" was directed by first-time director Hirotsugu Kawasaki and supervised by Katsuhiro Otomo (the creator of ""Akira"") and is based on a manga ""Striker"" by by Chu Takasige and Ryoji Minagawa which appeared on the publication ""Shonen Sunday"".

  Suffice to say, the anime made headlines when there was a major bidding war over the rights to make the movie.

  With Otomo and Kawasaki at the helm together with the animators of Studio 4C, ""SPRIGGAN"" was a film to utilize traditional cel animation with computer animation which was very significant at the time.
  As for the story behind ""SPRIGGAN"", athe top of the world, the ancient artifact known as Noah's Ark has been uncovered.

  It is said that the artifact elevates its keeper to the status of a god or it can be used to eliminate mankind from the Earth in seconds.
  The race is on as two secret organizations go to battle in their efforts to recover the lost artifact - one seeks to destroy it, and the other wants enslave the human race!

  It is a battle between the half-human cyborgs versus the secret organization known as ARCAM and their elite agents, the Spriggan in an epic duel for the future of humanity.

  The original DVD release of ""SPRIGGAN"" from ADV Films was back in 2001.  In 2005, a special edition has been released which features a new DTS soundtrack, the original CD soundtrack and two audio commentaries.  One by the ADR director and engineer, the other by two of the English voice actors (Chris Patton and Kelly Manison).

  Without spoiling the anime for the curious, I will say that ""SPRIGGAN"" is definitely action oriented.

  The animation is very well done, the voice acting is very well done and the DTS soundtrack for the English version is awesome!  The video is 1:1:85 aspect ratio and anamorphic widescreen.

  As much as I love ""SPRIGGAN"", I feel that there are problems with this special edition release.

  The inclusion of the CD soundtrack for ""SPRIGGAN"" is great because the music for the film is awesome.  But there is a problem.

  Although the back of the CD soundtrack lists 20 tracks, there are actually 27 tracks and unfortunately the 7 remaining tracks are not listed.  No worry, if you were to put your CD in your computer, you can get the remaining track titles via CDDB.
  And for a major release, there's a typo on the DVD features listing.
  But the one thing that made me knock the rating down to a B+ from an A was that the original 2001 DVD release of ""SPRIGGAN"" featured really cool animated interactive menus, video portfolios of the character designs, vehicles and equipment, key backgrounds which are now all gone in this special edition release.
  Granted, for those who never purchased the 2001 release would probably never know but for those of us ""SPRIGGAN"" fans who do know, those special features from the original release was a major addition that really made the DVD a complete package and if included with the special edition, would have made it the ultimate.

  But all-in-all, aside from that, you still get a spankin' new look at ""SPRIGGAN"" with that DTS soundtrack.  It sounded great via digital 5.1 several years ago but sounds so awesome now.

  I highly recommend checking ""SPRIGGAN"" out!  The experience is definitely worth it!",1218585600,4,3422,4.765410958904109
1689686,4,B000063IMS,"Review is opinionated, read my other anime review to get a feel for what I like.

I thought this anime was awesome. Doens't hold entirely to its original manga, and the plot is a little farfetched, but this is anime. Not reality TV.

Cloud, dust and snow animation are all very convincing. Watching the commentary will show you how much time and effort were put into the subtle things.

this movie is about half action, half story. I found the action to be wonderful. the soundtrack was nothing impressive, but was entirely unfamiliar to me. The Sound FX of the movie are also top notch.

There is a fair amount of glood, and the gore is not overwhelming, but there is enough of it. If you need a solid story or highly convinving plot, steer clear of this. if you want some good action, to be confused about some parts and to walk away remembering how good a few of those scenes were, I suggest it.",1202083200,,898,4.391566265060241
1689687,5,B000063IMS,"Don't get me wrong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00012QLQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>&nbsp;was good, and Akira is what springs to everyone's lips when they think ""anime."" Still, I actually like the animation and the flow of the story better in Spriggan. I also liked the fact that this anime was more action-oriented (granted it's rather bloody in places; war is hell. So I wouldn't recommend showing it to squeamish kids w/o parental supervision).

Now, that's not to say I don't have any reservations about Spriggan. I thought the ending was, as many anime endings are, slightly cheap and incomplete. Granted it was ""climactic"" in some regards, and looked pretty, but it seemed to not necessarily tie everything up completely. Not that I could necessarily write a better ending, as some questions don't really have easy answers, and some problems don't have easy or sensible resolutions. So, I don't ENTIRELY begrudge the usual ""shortcut"" ending(s).

On the whole, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. But, that said, I was pleasantly surprised. I can say, however, that it's light years ahead of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harmagedon/dp/B00006HAYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harmagedon</a>&nbsp;(which I watched just prior to Spriggan), in terms of visuals, character design and development. There didn't seem to be any ""reused"" scenes, unlike many early animes used (in fight scenes and whatnot). Or, if there were, I didn't notice them (unlike in Harmagedon).

There were minimal features on the disc (commentary & trailers mostly). But the video and audio were good, and the feature itself I liked. So, if you're into ""fighting""/""super soldier"" animes, pick up Spriggan if it's at a good price. I picked up the basic version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spriggan/dp/B000063IMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spriggan</a>, however there is a ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Special-Edition/dp/B000767QRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Special Edition</a>"" of Spriggan with additional commentary. If you can get them for the same price, go for the special edition (however, where I picked it up, the regular version was about 1/2 the price, and the additional commentary track didn't seem worth the bump in price).

So, there you have it. I give this one a ""recommend.""",1177027200,2,2476,6.316568047337278
1689688,5,B000063IMS,I'm not good at writing reviews on anime. I'm usually a vocal person when it comes right down to it. This has to be one of Hirotsugu Kawasaki's best work. The story line flowed seemlessly right to the climatic end. This is one every true anime fan should have in their collection,1153872000,,279,4.384615384615385
1689689,4,B000063IMS,"""Spriggan"" is one of the most action-packed anime movies I have seen. After initially reading the story and reviews I was expecting to watch a muscle-bound man in an action packed no-brainer movie. However, I was delighted to discover that the main character Yu is similar in age and looks to Souske Sagara from Full Metal Panic - a good looking teenage Japanese guy. The fact that both character have the same voice actor - Chris Patton - and both work for secret military international agencies only adds to this similarity.  So for all you Full Metal Panic fans out there, this may be the closest to a serious movie along the lines of FMP that you are going to get.

The storyline: Two rival military secret agencies are both trying to claim an archaeology find in Turkey - Noah's Ark and to discover the secret that lies within. Of course this being anime - human experimentation, psychic children, and mechanical/human hybrids - also feature.

The action is non-stop but is also vitally important to the storyline. The soundtrack and dubbing are excellent and the graphics are similar to Cowboy Beebop: The movie. It is only upon the second viewing that you get to fully appreciate the level of detail the creators have put in their background scenery and action pieces. After I finished the movie I have to admit that I was disappointed - but only because it had ended. Why was this never carried on and made into a proper series? It has so much promise that you will also be dying to follow Yu on his next assignment. Recommended if you enjoyed Akira or Full Metal Panic or simply a good action-packed movie.",1142208000,3,1615,4.63986013986014
1689690,4,B000063IMS,"(MOVIE REVIEW)
Spriggan, while definitely an entertaining movie, is not the deepest, though you won't think it after you hear what the movie is about. It's carried by its action, and there are times when characters are introduced solely to bring action into a scene (i.e. Jean when he first fights Little Boy). But as an action flick, this movie is excellent, and carries itself well using mostly the action, with very little in the way of plotting.

The story is basically about two rival organizations: one is an American organization hell-bent on keeping America on top; the other is a world-wide organization meant to protect the world from potentially dangerous artifacts. At the core of this second group is an elite unit of warriors known as Spriggan, and Ominae Yu, who appears to be your everyday Japanese student, is one of their best. He's sent to Mt. Ararat in Turkey in order to help protect the recently discovered Noah's Ark. That's when the opposing organization makes their claim to the ancient artifact; so starts the endless scenes of great action. Yet during all of this, Col. MacDougal, a child-psychic, makes his way to and into the Ark, and seems to be the only one who knows the true purpose of the Ark. Is it a savior of man-kind, or a weapon of ultimate destruction? Either way, Ominae doesn't care. His job is to keep enemies away, and he goes about doing this as only he knows how.

What's great about this movie is not just the action, but the excellent animation as well. Though a bit washed and chaotic at times, Katsuhiro Otomo's influence on the film is evident, with super-detailed scenes and settings, his own unique character styling, and his penchant for Akira-like violence. Without him working as supervisor, I'm sure this movie would have failed. So, with that said, I'd recommend Spriggan to people who enjoyed Akira and aren't too picky about deep plotting (like me). If you're like this, you may be one of the people who gives this movie five stars.

(SOUNDTRACK REVIEW)
For anyone familiar with the Spriggan movie, you know what to expect of this soundtrack: high-impact symphonic sounds, as well as some harmonic singing in the background, often with a quick, harsh tone. A lot of the songs are techno/hard rock mixes, with a few softer sounds. Only a couple have actual lyrics played along with the music, but in truth this is one CD that doesn't really need lyrics, as the songs very in tempo from moment to moment, stealing away some of the repetativeness that comes with intrumental music.

The good thing about this CD is it has a huge track list (20 are listed on the back cover, but mine has 27, which I attained through the special edition movie). But the problem with this is that most of the songs sound the same. It's a good soundtrack, but not very well-rounded. Easily, the best song on the CD is ""Jing Lin,"" the opening track. Other good tracks are ""Drive in Istanbul,"" as it has the feeling as if it is being played right on the streets of Istanbul; ""Ararat"" is also well-done, and is the first real some to come along with a different sound than most of the other songs, and it constantly morphs into something different, from mysticism to techno to jazz.

If you can get the Spriggan Special Edition, then I'd highly recommend you get the sound track this way. While it's a good soundtrack, it can be surpassed for others and isn't really worth the price tag on it.",1138665600,,3427,4.657851239669421
1689691,4,B000063IMS,"Spriggan is a fast-paced action story with beautiful animation. However, that's ALL it is. If you're looking for an entertaining story filled with lively and well drawn fight scenes, then this is for you. However, characterization is limited, and in some cases non-existent. The plot is simple and leaves areas outside the main plotline almost completely unexplored. There is also no romantic angle to it.

In other words, this movie is good at what it is, which is a pure shoot 'em up adventure film complete with everything from car chases to gun battles to knife fights. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than that.",1126915200,9,624,4.886792452830188

1689693,3,B000063IMS,"Spriggan formats itself as more a less an anime film as much as just a plain action film. Luckily the charcheter desisns are not of the anime cliche and (gasp!) theres almost a sense of style in a ""Akira"" like way. And unlike most anime its not purposely over complicated. The action and animation is also crisp and fluid and doesnt rely on dramatic still shots and closeups. Outside of that given though its mainly a rote action flick at that. The plot has a sort of interesting tinge to it but the whole seems unfinished and the whole thing seems like an Indiana Jones pic (atient relic with power discovered, good guys want to keep it out of bad guys hands). But the pace isn't sluggish so things are brisk and not talk heavy. not the msot memorable of animated pics but certainly noteworthy for its elements.",1111104000,,812,4.493243243243243
1689694,5,B000063IMS,"ok, maybe the title of the review is a bit over the top. i might not be ""sad"", exactly. i am-irritated.

""a reviewer"" the name given by a previous reviewer exemplifies the reasons i am ""irritated"" to be an american. basically, i am a fan of ""anime"" NOT cartoons. an example of a cartoon to me would be: roughnecks, titan a.e., batman, static shock, etc.

the ""negatives"" given by ""a reviewer"" shows that he/she is a fan of ""cartoons"". to address them point by point:

>meaningless dialogue-that comment shows that ""a reviewer"" does NOT understand how ""animation"" is used in japan. ""anime"" is/are movies. big budget/production feature length movies. even in most american produced action movies (which is essentially what spriggan was) there is a dialogue, that rarely ever fits or has meaning. my point, however, is that it is a feature length film not a saturday morning cartoon.

>hero couldn't die-one word, willing suspension of disbelief. ok that was four but you see the point. furthermore, the character did NOT get shot or blown up. he got shot at and explosions were near him but not on him. this isn't rare. i suggest that bruce willis' character in die hard to more damage than this character and let's not mention the A-Team, Bad Boys, etc. how many american movies do cars explode AND flip and the drivers are ok.

>drawn out ending-again it is a feature length film. therefore, maybe it is harder, as in most action movies, to wrap everthing up in a saturday morning fashion.

>bad graphics-if those are bad graphics i'd like to see what you consider ""good"" graphics. i watch an obscene amount of anime (maybe i shouldnt admitt that, lol) and i can't think of any american (or any other country besides japan) producing anything better than spriggan.

in conclusion, i think it is our, americans, insistence on everything being ""fast/simple"" that we lack the ability to appreciate anything that asks us to think or concentrate for more than 20 mins (the standard length of a sit-com/tv show).",1100563200,,2006,4.813953488372093
1689695,5,B000063IMS,"wow, i guess i forgot how awesome this really was. when i previously wrote a review for Spriggan i had forgotten what i loved about it and i only remembered what i didn't like. seriously, this is very underrated. the action is so intense you will find yourself sweating throughout the film. one thing that really keeps you so in to Spriggan is that the main charachter, Yu often is in near death experiances and sometimes you think he is just about to die, but then somehow he finds a way to defeat the enemy. this isn't one of those films in which the main character just blows down any threat without any difficulty.
if you are wandering why alot of people don't like this, it's mainly because most people(including myself a short time ago) were expecting another Akira since this movie was made by the same people. well, all i can say is that when i watched this again i tried just enjoying the movie rather than expecting a mind-blowing plot. i began to relize that the soundtrack was actually quit decent and both the animation and the action scenes were absolutely spectacular.
overall, this is a great anime and a must have for all action fans.

I liked the ""ark theory,"" that was a rather creative concept. The English dub over for the weird bubble boy did a nice job.  However, there was just too much jumping around in the story. One minute you were viewing the main character leaving a room and the next minute he was on a plane with no indication when, where and why. It almost got to a point where you did not care. And leave it to anime writers to come up with some sort of cheesy method to make a young teenager have super human strength. But I guess that is pretty typical anime.
Regardless of all the negatives, I would casually recommend this anime. Watch it to experience it. The big explosions may make up for the small story.",1038528000,3,826,4.261146496815287
1689712,2,B000063IMS,"I have watched quite a fair amount of anime, but this has got to be one of the most disappointing titles I have ever watched. While there are a lot of slam, bam, kid-with-superhuman-strength-saves-the-world titles out there, Spriggan almost takes the cake when in comes this eye candy/zero-plot genre. In Spriggan, 17 year-old Yu Ominae fights for ARCAM, a secret organization focused on protecting ancient and dangerous ruins. He is a Spriggan, in essence an elite super solider trained from childhood to be an efficient killing machine. After an unsuccessful attempt on his life by a rival organization, Yu becomes involved in a case centered around protecting the newly-excavated Ark of Noah, which is in fact an extraterrestrial ship with the ability to destroy or create new life on the planet. To top this absurdity, the Pentagon deploys a genetically enhanced child, Col. MacDougall, along with some extremely powerful and insane cyborgs after the Ark to retrieve it at any cost....Now even I could come up with a better plot than this. But of course, you'd have to see the movie to see what I mean when I say the plot falls apart quicker than toilet paper left out in the rain.
I mean, the movie starts out intersting enough, but so much more time could have easily been spent developing the characters, plot, motivation, back-stories while at the same time keeping almost all of the action and fight scenes intact. We never really find out why the Pentagon wants the Ark, or how and why Yu originally became involved with ARCAM. And while religion is often prevelant in many anime titles (most of the times in a convoluted, misunderstood way), Spriggan does a good job of somehow throwing in Biblical references into the already disorganized plot and twists them to a whole new, annoyingly absurd level. When the sinister child Col. MacDougall proclaims that he was ""chosen by God"" to open up the Ark, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Also, the constant referal to the characters being ""inside Noah"" as opposed to the Ark, had me wondering if the creators actually knew what Noah and the Ark actually were. By no means, however, were the misinterpereted Biblical references the only cliche in the movie.
Again, the United States (as in many anime titles) is portrayed as an arrogant, naive nation bent on controlling the world at all costs, often to the consternation of more ""civil"" nations and countries. While this viewpoint could be brought up at certain moments in real life, a no-brainer movie such as Spriggan certaintly does not have the merits or skill to present this topic in an intelligent way, and the theme of protraying America in a condescending manner only adds on more cliches to Spriggan.
While I know many action movies suspend the laws of physics, Spriggan goes so far as to present some of the most unrealistic action scenes known to man. Yu and his comrade Jean-Jaques Mondo face their fair share of abuse, but what they can withstand is obnoxious. You have to witness the scenes with Jean and Little Boy (and Jean doesn't even have on super-human armor!), or Yu's fight with Col. MacDougall to truly appreciate the level of absurdity when it comes how much of a beating they can take. My eyes nearly rolled out of their sockets when Yu and Jean escaped from the Ark. Nonsense I tell you!
Lastly, the soundtrack nearly left my ears ringing and my eyes watering. While the soundtrack throughout the movie seems to have potential, the composers obviously were uninspired. I nearly left the room when I heard the male vocals in English during the closing credits. That has to be one of the worst songs in anime history. Ha!
About the only thing I can recommend about this movie are the action sequences, which, while absurd, are pretty impressive. But unless you have some serious money to burn, don't even think about buying Spriggan; renting it is probably your best bet. By the way, what the heck is a ""Spriggan"" anyway?",1036540800,9,3953,4.797653958944282
1689713,4,B000063IMS,"Okay, let me get this out of the way right now:
This movie is not trash, and is not amazing, but somewhere in between.
I will also say this: the action scenes are spectacular. If you're just into movies for action and eye candy, this is your movie.
Now that that's out of the way, here we are, we've just finished watching Spriggan, and the credits are scrolling by. Now, you're thinking about the movie, and probably the interesting (to say the least) plot. I feel that the way this plot was handled is... superior to most. I mean, using the Ark as a technologically enhanced machine of tomorrow... well... it's amazing... Definately one of the more creative plots around.
Now, here's the kicker. The audio. Some people have complained that the voices fade in and out. This was done ON PURPOSE, people. And in a great way too. The further the camera is away, the quiter the voice. The way the reverberations on the sounds was handled amazingly too. Truly realistic sound in this movie. The musical score was also astounding and dramatic, sometimes even catchy, like when Yu Ominae was driving down the road in his nice beat-up rags, and you heard a somewhat ethnic-techno-rock-gregorian-chant-mix-up in the background. VERY cool.
Character design and length hold this back though. The character design is seemingly average, and this movie should've been 2 hours, not an hour and a half, as the story could have evolved into something so BRILLIANT (as if it wasn't already) and so DISTURBING, it would have been pure genius to see. Picture the Ark sequence having ""more"" to it... or maybe the chase through the market. Heck, any scene being longer would have been great...
Overall, you should definately check this one out. Pure brilliance, minus a few IQ.
Plot - 4/5 (Quite original, a few plot holes, though)
Animation/Graphics - 4/5 (Pretty darn amazing)
Sound - 5/5 (Beautiful)
Development - 3/5 (Needed more time)",1035849600,,1918,4.832826747720365

1689726,3,B000063IMS,"A few points to clear up.  Spriggan is based on a manga release in Japan titled Striker.  The movie IS NOT a manga to film adaptation, but a completely different story all together.  So if after watching Spriggan you want kinda a new story to follow, getting the manga will be a good step. There has been so much hype surrounding this movie's release from the explosive trailers that were released for it.  Many people were expected one thing, but felt they got another.  Well folks, YOU GOT WHAT YOU SEEN!!!
Animation:  The Animation here is superb.  The fight scenes were so well choreographed they almost seemed real.  There were many nice camera techniques used here to keep pace with the explosive filled action sequences that worked very well.  But as for anything ground breaking, Spriggan offered little to new innovation.  You'd find all that you seen here in many other anime series.
Characters:  I think you'd have to read the manga to get a feel for the characters because there is really no character development here.  It simply follows the Good guy versus bad guy motif throughout the whole movie.  Yeah there were some solemn parts of Yui's past, but other than that, there seems to have been nothing more offered.  What you see is what ya got.  As for interesting Characters?  Well, we've seen these types all before.  There seemed not to have been anything really unique.  But boy did the action sequences make up for all of it.
Story (Don't worry, no real spoilers):  The story revolves around the discovery of Noah's ark deep in the Antarctic.  A power struggle ensues between two organizations; one fighting to keep the Ark's secrets secret and another wanting to unleash the power of it's true use.  Special agents known as Spriggans are dispatched to fight for the Ark and prevent it from being opened. The story is verrry good.  I would say above all criticism, the story makes up for it all.  But after watching it you will get the feeling that so much more could have been done with this.  More could have been added to the story that would have made it more unique.  But alas, it fell short, not offering anything further.  The movie seemed too rushed.  You'd be left scratching your head about 5 minutes into it cause things just happen too fast.
Conclusion:  There seemed to have been one problem with this movie...  There were some points in the film were the characters voices would go from normal to faint for no reason at all.  And no, it wasn't a DVD malfunction.  This was actually found in the final product.  This aspect was what really turned me off.  There were times I could swear the characters mouths were moving but nothing would come up.  Sometimes you'd kinda have to put your ear to the TV to get the line.  Don't think about putting on the Subtitles to get those missed lines.  They're translation is so far off from what is really being said you'd think your viewing another movie.  But fortunately, these audio mishaps don't occur throughout the whole film.  I would say you'd encounter this about five times.  It's just that these five times are at the heart of the movie.  But overall, Spriggan is a good movie to maybe rent and check out.  I predict you'll have a good experience with this film.  Just make sure to put your volume up.",1032048000,3,3286,4.614186851211072
1689727,3,B000063IMS,"The artwork in Spriggan is clearly impressive off the back of the box.  The plot is fairly well organized and intended.  However, during the actual course of the script, I think many essential details were omitted (perhaps due to time restrictions - I can only hypothesize, having not read the manga).  It's over simplified and very rough in some ways.  However, the action is very impressive and the artwork is beautiful.  A recomended view.",1030838400,,442,4.918918918918919
1689728,5,B000063IMS,"This is definetly one of the greatest animes I have seen in a long time.  First heard about it from one of my friends and I became hooked ever since.  The concept behind Noah's Ark being a spaceship was a very original idea to me.  Cornol McDougal could have been expanded upon a little bit more though, and the brief 2 min. story of Yu's past leaves you wanting more.  Some question's one will ask thogh are they only two spriggan's?  What happened elsewhere after the Cornol told Yu of other places of great artifacts like Noah's Ark?  Very good story.....just could have been a little longer.",1029456000,,595,4.514018691588785
1689729,1,B000063IMS,"I would like to comment that the rebuttle that it's an action anime and hence doesn't need a descent plot or character development is totaly bogus. Heck Johny Numonic, Total Recall, and heck even Fortress are all better than this movie (though IMO none of them are good). Yet I guess there are simple minded moves for a reason.
If you really want an action get Golgo 13: The Professional (not Queen Bee), good action, great car chase, some reasonable plot, unique characters. Just keep in mind that it came out in '83 and the CG scene at the end was cutting edge at the time.
_spoiler, maybe_
Back to Spriggan, what the heck is up with the ending, aside form being mildily crazy the Colonel is so overwhelemingly powerful how the heck did he lose. And he didn't really loose he for some reason decides to blow up the Ark and kill himself, WHY???",1029369600,4,845,4.458064516129032

1689731,5,B000063IMS,"Spriggan came to some theatres in the US a while back, with much hype. Most compared it to Akira.
Spriggan finally arrived to DVD in April and I was able to pass my own judgement upon it.
Remember Akira? I thought it was a classic anime. However, after reading some of the manga, I quickly realized as good an anime as it was, a LOT of the story was condensed nd much compromising was made. Major characters took a complete backseat, some making mere cameos. For this reason, some don't look at the movie as well as they should.
Well, Spriggan suffers from the same problem. This was also a Manga first, called Striker here in the US. I myself have had a chance to see it, and the story was greatly condensed as well.
But don't let that keep you from getting this anime! The story, while quite light, is still present. However, I will admit that is not really the highlight of the movie. It's the action that takes center stage!
Spriggan is an aboslutely exciting anime filled with many memorable fight scenes.
The story revolves around Yu Ominae, a high-school student who is also a part of a top-secret organization known as ARCAM. When his friends begin to be killed off one by one, he goes off to Turkey in search of who is reponsible. What he finds is beyond comprehension, as he meets a group of half machine/half human beings bent on finding the secret behind Noah's Ark deep within Mount Ararat. In a desperate bid to stop their malevolent plans, Yu must fight against immeasurable odds.
The fight scenes are absolutely sights to behold. The bullets fly, punches blaze through the air; the action gets crazy but never too hectic. The animation is top-notch and completely smooth.
And the sound is a bonus as this film is filled with explosions and battle cries. The music, while probably not classic, has a couple memorable beats. ""Jing Ling,"" the ending theme, is extremely infectious and in fact, as I type, I am listening to it.
The DVD menu itself is quite clean and I thought ADV did a good job. The extras tie up the package. Not the best I've seen, but certainly no the worst. Production sketches of vehicles and key locations and characters. My only gripe is of all the trailers to forget, they forgot to add Spriggan's!
All in all, this DVD is worthy of a purchase and is excellent to show to friends just starting with anime, or just want some non-stop action!",1027468800,3,2378,4.532558139534884
1689732,2,B000063IMS,"I had heard great things about this movie and was sure that it would be good so I bought it.  Although I liked the idea of the movie, I did not care for the look of this film.  The animation was dark and muddy.  Also, the characters lacked development and the plot moved at a very slow pace.  I hit the skip forward button on my DVD player hoping that things would get better, but it never did.  Maybe hard core animation fans would like it, but for a casual fan like me that watches Robotech and the Transformers, this was not the movie for me.",1026432000,8,545,4.10377358490566

1689734,2,B000063IMS,"The packaging touts this movie as a blend of Indiana Jones and James Bond, but there's a little too much Dragonball Z in the mix for my liking.  All the tired old anime cliches and tropes are trotted out- cyborgs, super-agent schoolboy with myterious past and numbered tattoo, doomsday devices, floating fortresses, genius child villain psychic;  and are thrown together with a bunch of tired old live action movie cliches- chases through alley way markets, mysterious ancient ruins, jungle fights, benign mad professor with gadgets and beautiful bespectacled assistant, loose cannon agent and older more earthed offsider. The sum is magically somewhat less than the parts.

Music-2,Plot-1,Art-4, Characters-1, DVD Quality-2
From what i heard of the music it was pretty bad, i didn't hear very much since i was in the bathroom half the time throwing up from lack of plot. The plot was incredibly rediculous...parts of it were rip off's of Akira (which i recommend) Things go completely unexplained in the plot and there are many holes all around. You don't even know the main characters name because all he gets called the whole movie is ""Spriggan"" or ""Cockroach."" There is a little dork in control who doesnt seem the least bit evil or scary...ANd then there is that blonde spriggan guy, LOL He's supposed to be french right? Well halfway thru the movie his lame little accent goes Spanish, and then at the end sounds totally Irish. HAH, well overall this movie is a definite no...  the sound goes from being loud to so soft you cant even hear what the characters are saying.
Frankly if i could give this any less than a star i would.
Go checkout Trigun, Cowboy bebop, Captain Tylor, or RANMA! Amazon has some great deals on those... Or if you're looking for movies, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke.
Heed my warning! I don't know how this movie got such a high rating!

1689736,4,B000063IMS,"Let me first say this: There are many different kinds of films in the world of anime.
There's slow paced thought provoking dramas like Jin-roh, psycological mind-bending thrillers like Perfect Blue and visually impressive adrenalin rushes of action like Akira where the only moral seems to be ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and then the audience is treated to hours of explosions and psycic powers and imploding body parts and splat-gore-mutant-blood-screaming actionpacked fun to emphasize this point.
Spriggan is another one of these.
And as long as you realize that, before sitting down to watch it, you'll be okay with that beacause it does it really well. The action and the animation really IS impressive, and you will be entertained the whole way through as long as you don't expect the story to make sense, the characters to have more dimensions than the sheet of paper they were drawn on and the audience to walk away with any profound insight or valuable morale.
Spriggan is just not that kind of flick.
It is merely there to entertain. And it's not like it even pretends to attempt to go any deeper than that. So I'm cool with it.",1025395200,7,1156,4.843434343434343

(im not kidding there were actually dinosaurs......dont ask me how) if ou really want a good action anime that has at least some semblance of a story line get akira or outlaw star. if you're new to anime steer clear of this one lest it tarnish your opinion of the genra forever..........but seriously get akira.......it rox!,1025308800,5,606,4.836538461538462

1689739,2,B000063IMS,"""Spriggan"" is a jumble of mismatched thoughts, over-used themes, heavy handed action, and mid-quality animation. The plot plods from one point to another without much continuity. The praised action sequences are long, boring, and bloody: in anime standards, it's adequate. It does not have the details of modern combat like ""Ghost in the Shell"" or even ""Patlabor II"" but lots of bullets from a cyborg-with-a-mini-gun-for-an-arm, and the flying fury of some little guy who throws knives (hmm. we haven't seen those before). What about characters? Development? What development? The story revolves around a high school student who is the top operative of a secret organization that guards all ancient religious relics (??), and the movie centers around the finding of Noah's Ark. There really isn't too much more to the story than that, except the big showdown at the end with a psionic bio-engineered child that is the United States' SECRET WEAPON. If this description doesn't make you cringe, it should. This anime is the equivalent of a bad Hollywood action film (think ""End of Days"" BAD) and represents the art/entertainment form of anime terribly.

1689740,2,B000063IMS,"I have just finished watching one of the most uninspired movies I have ever seen.
Firstly, it's good points. The soundtrack had, although not completely memorable, decent tracks that did a supurb job of enhancing the scenes. I found a couple very pleasing to the ear. The animation was clean and rather nice at most points, particularly in the action sequences. Motions were fluid and very realistic, colors were good, and detail was adequate.

Now. With that aside, this was your typical action movie with a weak plot. Sadly, it makes every attempt not to succumb to the mindless entertainment genre, while ultimately failing.
The beginning showed promise, as the first couple of events were intriguing. However, as it progresses, it unfolds into a limp, cliche-ridden story. Additionally, the characters suffer no characterization, and Yu, the main character, has minimal. Therefore it is impossible to experience any amount of connection with them. Jean-Jaques Mondo's ""role"" in the story felt like nothing more than filler - besides being a friend to Yu, he is given no other explanation. He simply exists. And the antagonist was definitely 'ripped out' of Akira, as a previous reviewer noted. He as well as no apparent motive for his actions, and that is all the more damaging.
Spriggan attempted to execute a plot that needed an at least adequate amount of depth for it to stay afloat and be worthwhile. It does not succeed, and by the time the credits roll, it leaves you with nothing.

Spriggan has an okay story and very good action.  It is also dubbed very well and the animation, while not world altering, is more than enough to get the idea across.  But Spriggan also is not all that it could be.
When I watched it, I liked the action sequences but I felt that much of it was more borrowed from other anime than origional.  The hero is not unlike Jubei in Ninja Scroll or even the hero in Fist of the North Star.  However, unlike these other characters, this guy is not well defined or fleshed out.  The main villians also fall into some of the more stereotypical designs.  If you are a Anime fan, you will find yourself recognizing many of them.
The ending battle was very good but also anti-climatic.  I guess I wanted a little more out of the final conclusion.  I half expected the main Spriggan (the hero) to whip out some even more hidden powers like Dragon Ball Z or even Neon Genesis Evangelion ( he does have hidden powers by the way...Just not what I expected).  ""Sigh"" that might not have worked but I still looked forward to it.
Overall, if you collect Anime, you should buy this movie.  But if you are looking for something epic and endlessly re-watchable, you might look elsewhere.",1020729600,,1360,4.506122448979592

It's got your stereotypical characters - super soldier, psychic kid, evil government branch, old scientist dude and some French guy. There are many explosions! It is very well animated and fun to watch, but the plot will leave you a little confused on the details and has a high corniness quotient. The ending especially was like a string of cliches, while at the same time not making a lot of sense.
The one feature that makes it stand out is the dub sounds great! I hardly ever watch dubs because they usually do not begin to compare to the Japanese version, but all the actors in the Spriggan dub did a wonderful job!! The voices fit the characters (perhaps better than the originals), and the acting was on the mark.
I do have a complaint about the DVD menus, which is the text is so small I had a difficult time reading it. My tv is of a decent size, so I have no idea why they chose to make the writing so tiny. Besides that, the extras were ok, but there wasn't much of them.
This was fun to watch once, but I doubt I will watch it again. It's a nice rental. If you enjoy action movies even if they are a little cliched, you will probably have fun watching this.",1019520000,8,1238,4.294871794871795

1689750,1,B000063IMS,"I purchased the much anticipated Spriggan yesterday.  I must say I wasn't this excited about a anime since the release of Ghost In The Shell.  I first got a taste of the Spriggan film as a preview on an Arc The Lad DVD.  After that I did some net research and became even more excited.  This looked to be the holy grail of action animes.  If felt like they where finally gonna make a Metal Gear Solid like anime without it being a total rip off.  10 minutes into the film I realized three things.  This is nonsense, I'm too old, and I'm too old for this nonsense.
The anime is about a 17 year old, do all, end all super op/soldier that goes by the name Yu and is as about as deep as shag carpet.  His voice acting is so stupid Keanu Reeves would catch an upset stomach from Yu speaking a single sentence.  Yu suffers the same problem most anime and live action film heros suffer in today's action cinema.  You don't ever fear for his life.  And neither does he.  He holds a cavalier attitude about everything, even the death of his schoolmates.  Whatever happened to the underdog?  Whatever happened to going into a battle with no chance of winning and pulling it off at the end?  This guy is already a superhuman soldier with reflexes that would make a ninja flinch.  Does he need a suit to boost his strength 30%?
The plot is garbage.  They intoduce the Arc at the begining abandon it's importance until the end and then make it so ridiculous you don't even wanna hear about it anymore.  People attack Yu for no apparent reason.  Obviously they know he's a Spriggan.  So they send their worst henchman first.  I guess just to test him or something.  Then they introduce the French Spriggan Jean. I guess there is a Spriggan for every major country, since they don't even bother to explain what ""Spriggan"" is you just don't know.  They seem to be protectors.  Why they are protecting this, I don't know.  Why they even include Yu and Jean makes no sense.  It seems if they would have just left Yu alone the operation would have went on without a hitch.
That brings me to the Machine Corps, the group of antagonists supported by the Pentagon.  Why, I don't know.  They want the Arc to take over the world.  But it seems that the Machine Corp could do it by themsleves.  They all are unoriginal, and uninspired.  The main bad guy is Colonel MacDougall a small child with incredible telekenetic powers.  He's ripped straight from Akira which real hurts Spriggan's identity as it's own film.  They other baddie, the General looks stupid and serves no purpose in the story except for Yu's back story.  I still don't believe a gattling gun as an arm is that effective.  The last little guy uses wires to cut people into ribbons.  Which is cool, but since you know he's never going to catch Jean and Yu in it it's really just their to look cool.  He's fast when he wants to be, I guess he's so shook by a Spriggan he forgets all his superhuman powers.
The action really isn't all that.  I'm serious.  It's all hype.  The action sequences are few and far between.  They're nothing new, and granted their animated well, with a fast pace, they somehow become tired after a minute or so.  To say that these are the best action sequences in Anime history is just plain ignorance.  If you say that you must not have seen a lot of animes.  The action sequences in Batman: The animated series are better than Spriggan.  Sriggan doesn't even begin to come close to animes like Akira(OH MY GOD, the motorcycle chase at the begining kills the whole Spriggan movie), Ghost In The Shell,  Street Fighter Alpha:The Animation, Gun Smith Cats, Outlaw Star, any Gundam series, the DBZ movies and the TV series, Princess Mononoke, and Blue Sub 6 just to name a few.
In conclusion Animes don't have to make sense.  You don't throw on your logic and reason cap when making an action anime, it's fanatasy.  Few of the best animes make sense really.  But you have to meet certain elements of story telling.  And being an action movie doesn't mean your excused from that task.  Spriggan doesn't even try.  They open up so many doors it's overwhelming.  Then they don't close not a one, and when their tired of telling the one they've opended they open another one, and this cycle continues until the whole thing is so stupid it's blinding.  Don't buy or rent Srpiggan, don't even look at it.  It's one of the worst Animes ever made.",1019347200,16,4403,4.456712672521958
1689751,5,B000063IMS,"This is a lot like a summer popcorn movie, for the most part. The movie has a very heavy focus on it's visuals and action sequences, which are very excellently done. Of course, with people on staff like Katsuhiro Otomo and Hirotsugu Kawasaki you'll always have to expect this. In Akira, Otomo said that he liked to keep everything in motion. He never wanted to use any sort of still frames for any reason. For Spriggan, you get the same thing. The animation is almost constantly fluid and rarely, if never, gets stiff or jittery like most anime. There's some really nice scenes of CG, espacially with the scenes that take place inside the ark. It's steller and seamless at the same time (like the excellent CG in Princess Mononoke). The fight scenes are so wonderfully choreographed and storyboarded out, that Spriggan's action is a class in it's own. Take all of the fight scenes in Ninja Scroll, X, Ghost in the Shell, and Battle Angel and then put them into fast forward and you have Spriggan. Yes, they're all THAT GOOD!
As far as visuals and action sequences are concerned, this movie has it all.
The movie's audio is excellent. Considering this is a fairly recent anime, it's sound design is incredible. I espcially like how the echoes and distorted SFX were handled inside the ark sequences. The video transer is also very nice. Lots early scenes in the film are shown in very dark colors and the transfer handles them wonderfully. The backrounds are beautifully rendered and the character animation comes off very crisp and clear. The only problem with it is that once the scenes mostly take place inside the ark, there is a fair amount of grain on the characters. It isn't too distracting though. It also gives the film more of a cinematic feel.
Spriggan is something that really and truly excels at what it's trying to be, and that's an action flick with western based legends and religious ideas mixed into it. Sure the story runs a little thin at times and character development is kinda nil, but it's slight lack of depth makes it even more fun to watch. It does present some interesting ideas as well (like saying that Noah's Ark was a weather controlling device and a starter of life). It won't exactly put your brain on overdrive like Ghost in the Shell of Serial Experiments Lain, but it will make you think a little bit after the credits roll.
Lots of anime fans I know bash on this film because of it's lack of plot and character development. Why can't they all just sit down and enjoy a film that is just a simple piece of action and fun? Where have all their roots gone?
The film's soundtrack is also excellent with mixes of Turkish chants, atmospheric instrumentals, and electronic drum-beats. The most impressive track, though, is the movie's ending them which is an experimental techno song performed by Saju and sung in Mandarin (a rare find in anime). If you need a reason to buy the soundtrack, listen to this song. I swear it will move you to buy the soundtrack. It did for me.
Whether I watched this film in Japanese, English, or with commentary by the ADR directors, I got a different experience everytime.
Spriggan is a highly enjoyable film that will never gather dust on my shelf, and most likely not on yours.",1019347200,11,3243,4.622183708838821
1689752,3,B000063IMS,"i work at a video store and am a huge anime fan with a fairly large personal collection. i pre-ordered this upon reading some reviews, then i got the chance to see it before it got released and shipped to me. i changed my mind about wanting to own a copy. this film is fast paced, with some nice fight sequences, but over-all the plot was lacking. i was hard-pressed to get involved with any characters, had no connection toward any of them at all. basically a no brainer.",1019088000,,472,4.314606741573034
1689753,4,B000063IMS,"I don't know what people mean when they say this movie reminds them of a James Bond film.  In my eyes it by no means resembles one.  Its kind of like a weird Indiana Jones Terminator mystical ghost in the shell kind of thing (not really - -).  Its a fun movie and I suggest you watch it.  Its basically about Noah's arc being found and it turning out to be a thing that can change the worlds climate and stuff.  There are some good fight scenes but there are definetely better animes out there.  I like this film better then Ghost in the shell because it actually keeps you involved the whole movie, and you don't ever want to stop it or fast forward.
Try this one",1018828800,,664,4.1484375
1689754,5,B000063IMS,"Spriggan is an excellent work in the super soldier anime genre. Based off the manga by Takashige and Minagawa (who are now making the best selling manga ""Arms""), Spriggan has some subtle themes but by no means is challenging. The story is pretty fast paced with a fight scene punctuating every 5-8 minutes of plot development. A nice touch is that the good guys aren't really all that good ^_^
The ending is a little hokey but the combat scenes are unparralleled! Highly detailed, incredibly articulated and dynamic animation. As some one who's worked at some US animation shops I can say this is some of the best stuff I've seen in the past few years (in terms of the motion)...think Cowboy Bebop level of quality.
The non-action stuff is also beautiful compositionally. Kawasaki, the director, keeps his pallette very desaturated so it has a slighlty melencholoy feel to it. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning as it is very, very good. Maybe one of the best action movie soundtracks I have ever heard. I saw this on the big screen in Japan when it came out and saw it a few times since at various festivals (subtitled). I have enjoyed every screening.",1018483200,14,1158,4.70935960591133
1689755,5,B000063IMS,"Not every great anime film has to be thought provoking and deeply metaphorical.  As in live-action features, anime can be subdivided into a variety of different tiers:  drama, mystery/suspense, horror, action; etc.  To say a film isn't any good because it doesn't wholly encompass all these different genres is quite simply asking too much.  Spriggan is the action movie that all action movies aspire to.  Character designs are excellent, the animation is incredibly fluid, and the story, unless you're an infant, is quite easy to follow and is intriguing to boot.  This movie is for those of you who like to shut your brain down for a time, and just enjoy the pure visceral thrill that a good action flick can create.  Highly recommended.",1018396800,,739,4.911290322580645
1689756,3,B000063IMS,"As it may help you to have more fun, if you think that 007 movies are the most unrealistic things you have ever seen, it's only because you never gave Spriggan a chance.
  The plot is an excuse for some of the greatest action scenes ever seen on anime, it revolves around Noah's Ark and a black-ops to prevent it being stolen (note that there's nothing that suggests that the original researchers of the Ark where to put it to good use, anyway).
  While watching it you may see lot's of action, but very few are made by the main character, who is Spriggan number one. Instead, another Spriggan, who doesn't even bother to tell his rank, does so much stuff that at some point you start to wonder on what the main character can actually do being number 1, what would open the path to a sequel so fans could wait for even better action (this movie is a small part of the original manga).
  If you're in for action and don't care for the lack of a plot, Spriggan will be an amazing movie to watch, as it is very well done and has great sound.",1016582400,6,1038,4.217171717171717

The reason to get this movie is because it was made for the big screen. No, not the one in your house but actual movie theaters, so the animation as well as the voice acting is just simply mind blowing! Unexpectedly, it also came with the movie soundtrack which is just as involving as everything else in this masterpiece.

I'll give it this, it is a lively little action thriller.  It's also loud and slightly obnoxious in its presentation.  The plot was doled out on a need to know basis..............obviously, the filmmakers didn't think we needed to know anything about the story because it's enigmatic to say the least.  There's a lot of running, shooting, trips to odd locations, more shooting, blood everywhere, several bad guys too many, and a little freak who thinks he's a god.  It also involves ""an"" ark, not THE ark.  It's rated R.  It's not something I'd ever watch again.",1359072000,,778,4.804511278195489
