Great video with brilliant color and high quality, realistic sound.  I own many nature and relaxation dvds and Mr. Tony Helsloot/World Nature Videos offer some of the very best.  I liked this dvd so much that I bought the second TV Jukebox.
I highly recommend any of their products.  Their prices are reasonable for the high quality products you receive.
Another great video!!!",1383177600,,517,5.107142857142857
8164297,4,B000LV9L9Y,"This video was a gift to my mom who wanted to play something in the background at parties and family gatherings. The sound quality is wonderful and the locations are absolutely stunning. I also love the range of settings this dvd provides. While many of these type products highlight themed locations such as ""beach"" (a dock, a sunset, a boat) or ""winter"" (snowdrifts, fireplaces, a forest), Ambient TV Jukebox features all sorts of settings for any time of year or occasion. The waterfalls are two of my favorites and the goldfish can entertain children for hours. My mom has enjoyed this dvd and I really loved the price!",1293753600,,623,4.777777777777778
