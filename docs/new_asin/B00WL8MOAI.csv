7133064,4,B00WL8MOAI,"Per the press release: ""After taking the tech world by storm last season at TechCrunch Disrupt, Richard and rest of the Pied Piper team  Erlich, Jared, Dinesh and Gilfoyle  look ahead to a bright and profitable future. But their success may be in jeopardy, thanks to big changes at Raviga, the company created by Peter Gregory, and Nucleus, the competing compression platform launched by Hooli CEO Gavin Belson.""
We've got a thorough write-up of Season 2 here: [...]",1468713600,,466,4.961538461538462
7133065,5,B00WL8MOAI,"The Second Season lived up to the hype.  Amazing quips, great twists, and pure Mike Judge genius.  So enjoy the continuing journey of PiedPiper, and their rise to the top of the Valley.",1468108800,,185,4.575757575757576
7133066,5,B00WL8MOAI,Yes it met my expectations.  Season 2 was just as funny as Season 1.,1466294400,,68,3.857142857142857
7133067,5,B00WL8MOAI,great series,1465516800,,12,5.5
7133068,4,B00WL8MOAI,"Pretty hilarious show if you don't mind the language.  Language doesn't bother me at all, but they do take it over the top sometimes.

I don't think it was quite as good as season one.  Introduction of the female developer was a good choice.  I'm a software developer, so a lot of what is on the show resonates with real life.  The overall progress of Pied Piper just didn't move forward much in season two.  This season felt more like filler (hilarious as it was) to get to season three.",1465430400,,488,4.366666666666666
7133069,5,B00WL8MOAI,"Every single character got even better this season and the inevitable twists that result in the boys' startup company, Pied Piper, never quite getting ahead even when they win the day are classic. Also, let's get Gilfoyle and Dinesh their own show once this ends. Oh, and Episode Eight has to be one of the funniest episodes of any show in the last decade. I won't spoil it for anyone but the comebacks and interplay were insanely great.

The DVD box set itself has audio commentary, if you like, that on almost every one of the ten episodes. A few deleted scenes and a look at the tech ""calculations"" you often see onscreen. I think they could have done a far better job with the extras after Season One's pretty decent job with those extras.",1464912000,,743,4.503703703703704
7133070,5,B00WL8MOAI,"One of if not my favorite shows on HBO.  Being in the Tech world, so much of what they talk about i see everyday.",1464566400,,113,3.7083333333333335
8713726,5,B00WL8MOAI,"An amazing show. Obviously start with the 1st season if you haven't seen it  this show is highly serialized and you need to watch what comes before to understand what comes after. In general Mike Judge truly knows what he's doing, even if he doesn't yet know how to effectively satirize we on the political left (""The Goode Family""). He certainly rings the bell of the decent good-old-boys of the south (""King of the Hill"") and here with the Silicon Valley intelligentsia. Highly addictive, you have 46 episodes as of this writing to catch up on. If there is one criticism it's that the seasons are too short. At least 16 episodes would be appreciated.",1531094400,,652,4.6695652173913045
